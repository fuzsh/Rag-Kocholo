He used to be known as Tornado when he was under DeVante's Swing Mob label. Not much is known about the relationship between Ginuwine and DeVante except that I heard it through the grapevine that DeVante \"kicked out\" Ginuwine cuz he has no time for him. How real this rumour is remains to be seen.\n\nAs you know from the forum at cybertlc.com Left Eye AKA Nina dropped news that Natina of Blaque is on Tha Row. SO Thanks to NINA (Lefteye) for dropping the news on Natina AT A FORUM NOT DIRECTLY TO US.

Dont worry we give props to the source.\n\nEnjoy our old news archive....Soon DRHQ.com\n\nGusto\n\n29th Nov 2001\n\nI just received a snippit tape from Nino Brown, of Dogg Pound shit, remember im ripping this from Tape!

Ive played around with the edited shit, he says death row all the time, every time u hear the 'swis' backward sound he says death row. All the time on 'Im Country' or 'Just Touch'. He sounds like doobie, on 1 song he says 'southern death row don' and that aint even edited out or backwards. But every time u get that backward sound he says death row, I think he says suge to,but so far i only tryed the og im country, peace.\n\nTha 6s\n\n27th Nov 2001\n\nHere is a song from the new Knoc-Turnal album, thats out soon. Its produced by Fred Wreck as yu can hear, \"Lets All Roll\" feat. Jayo Felany, former Death Row inmate Slip Capone, Butch Cassidy & China Gyrl, whos a new female signed to the label (along with Slip Capone) & all over the album. Knoc-Turnal's originally from Long Beach.\n\nSwoop C\n\n25th Nov 2001\n\nI've been getting a lot of instant messages and emails about where can u find chocolate bandit's album. Well, u can find it at CDNOW. They also carry the single Gotta Have It on vinyl or cd there.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO USE THE FOLLOWING NEWS ON YOUR WEB SITE, PLEASE GIVE PROPS TO DEATH ROW ENTERTAINMENT!\n\nNow, just as you started to hear about this album, ITS OUT! That's right, Dr. Dre's album The Chronicle comes out in stores tomorrow, November 25. However, this album is not what you think it might be. The album marks the first Death Row UK release. The downside is that it will only be distributed in Europe, to begin with at least. Reason is, Dogg Pound 2002 has done so well in the UK that Ron Winters is pushing the back catalogue loads, Snoop's hits is doing well there to, and all back catalogue material sells huge in England. Therefore this CD will only be available in the UK as a Death Row/Ron Winters item. You can purchase the album online though if you click on that link. I leave you with the rather disappointing tracklist to the album, seeing as there were no unreleased songs that made the album.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. Nuthin' But A G Thang - Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Doggy Dogg\n\n2. Gin & Juice - Snoop Doggy Dogg feat. Dat Nigga Daz\n\n3. Afro Puffs - The Lady Of Rage\n\n4. Natural Born Killaz - Dr. Dre & Ice Cube\n\n5. Murder Was The Case - Snoop Doggy Dogg\n\n6. Lil' Ghetto Boy - Dr.Dre feat. Snoop Doggy Dogg & Dat Nigga Daz\n\n7. Let Me Ride - Dr. Dre feat. Ruben & Jewell\n\n8. California Love - 2Pac, Dr.Dre and Roger Troutman\n\n9. Fuck Wit Dre Day - Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Doggy Dogg, RBX & Jewell\n\n10. Serial Killa - Snoop Doggy Dogg, D.O.C., RBX & Tha Dogg Pound\n\n11. Stranded On Death Row - Dr. Dre feat. Bushwick Bill, Kurupt, RBX, The Lady Of Rage & Snoop Doggy Dogg\n\n12. NuthinÂ’ But A G Thang (rmx) - Dr. Dre\n\nI almost forgot to mention that The Chronicle is an enhanced cd containing the following:\n\nNuthin But A G Thang Full Length Video\n\nDre Day Full Length Video\n\nMerchandise & Back Catalog Information\n\nA personalized Dr. Dre Poster\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nScreensaver\n\n& Contest Information\n\nThats a pretty good load of goodies that comes with this CD! Stay tuned for more exclusive updates from the crew at Death Row Entertainment.\n\nSwoop C\n\n24th Nov 2001\n\nSup?? I know u all aint heard from me in awhile, but im back, oh boy am i BACK! I've been busy lately, but I did do a lot with our new layout and some other behind the scenes action.\n\nNow for the good shit! A couple days ago Matt Jory updated with the tracklist to Chocolate Bandit's upcoming album. Well, I wanted to come back with a bang, so here it is. Chocolate Bandit's album Lyrical Warfare in real audio. Every track full length and i did not fuck with the quality. Enjoy this shit.\n\nThere are 3 things about this album that i thought i should point out. The first being that track #2, Just Touch Me, is pretty much the same song as Doobie - Im Country from the Chronic 2000. Second thing is that track #7, Gotta Have It, which is also the first single, is just a remix of his song Wutz Da Deal from the 1998 rerelease of Gang Related. The last thing i wanted to point out is that most of the songs say featuring Jr. Nites. Now I don't know what the rest of u have heard about Chocolate Bandit, but I always heard that him, and Jr. Knight was the same person.\n\nThis album IS DEATH ROW MATERIAL. Proof of that is the different version of im country, the remix of wutz da deal, and a song featuring former death row inmates Six Two.\n\nIm out for today, look for me in the next few weeks with some BIG updates, possibly tomorrow! Hit me up on AIM at MarshColin or email me at MarshColin@aol.com PEACE!\n\nTha 666\n\n22nd Nov 2001\n\nHere are 2 Unreleased Deathrow inst trax from DJ Cheese who was signed to Death Row years ago & did work on 'Inside Out' compilation that never got released. 'Untitled Track 1' & 'Untitled Track 2'. Dj Cheese was from Compton. audio courtesy of Nino brown.\n\nSwoop G's half brother Keita Rock is releasing an album \"Lets Get It Crackin\" soon, the 1st single features luni & beats from tone & one stop (3x krazy producers). Yu may recognise him from Death Rows 'Too Gangsta For Radio' & Suga D.I.C's underground hit 'Necessary means' a few yrs ago.\n\nOn the new Busta Rhymes album, Track 13 'Wife In Law' after 3:45 mins contains the controversion \"Suge Shot Me\" vocals from Makaveli's 7 Day Theory album, Click here to download the song.\n\nIf yu havent heard Canibus new album, yu may be interested to know he's givin much love to Suge & calling out at industry fakes. Yu may see Bus dropping a verse on Crooked I's album, hold down DR ENT & CanibusHQ for more info, as were in talks with him. This is simular to how Stylez & Kiss of The Lox are giving it up & dissing RocAFella for their ignorance on Hot97. Suge once managed Lox before they became famous. Seems like Suge & Tha Row have much love from a lot of the real acts out there.\n\nMr. Kane (formerly known as Kokane) is still prepping for his new album titled Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Kane to be released on SnoopÂ’s label Dogghouse Records via Dr. DreÂ’s Aftermath Entertainment. The album will feature Snoop and Dre along with Macy Gray, Mystikal, DÂ’Angelo and Cee-Lo of the Goodie Mob. Look for it to drop sometime this fall. He has been around since the early 90Â’s. He signed with the late Eazy EÂ’s Ruthless Records and cut his first single Â“Nickel Slick NiggaÂ” for the Deep Cover soundtrack in 1991. Since then he has recorded a couple of solo albums and made guest appearances on numerous projects with artists like Snoop Dogg, Eazy E, E-40, George Duke, Dr. Dre, and many others.\n\nMatt Jory\n\n20th Nov 2001\n\nHey peopLe, Matty Jory back doing some work on deathrow ent here.

Rapindustry.com reported earlier Ray-J, Sisqo, Left-eye, DJ Quik, Above the Law (both on Production to) & as the homie reported J Valentine & Treach of Naughty By Nature.

Im hearing Crooked I could re-do a Snoop verse on an unreleased classic, so look out\n\nOG Nino Brown (WestcoastAftershock.com)\n\n3rd Oct 2001\n\nSnoop Dogg's Death Row Greatest Hits is in stores Oct 23rd. This follows the recent release of Tha Dogg Pound 2002. Which also contains material the from Death Rows vaults & has an impressive guest list, one of which Jay Z who has been used to SELL the album, which seems somewhat hypocritical following the disses on Too Gangsta For Radio.\n\nThe forefront currently at Tha Row is looking at Crooked I, Above The Law & J Valentine. 3 acts that would & hopefully will regain Death Rows status in the mainstream Hip Hop world. Crooked I recently dropped one of the tighest verses ive heard from any westerner for a long ass time on the new Dogg Pound CD, Ive heard his album could drop soon, which I find hard to believe considering he's pissed at Tha Row right now. Crook was promised an album within 5 months of him signing.\n\nOnto the music, as requested by many cool peeps showing luv!.....\n\nI dont know if you remember back in 98/99 my boy Playa P put up a gang of underground Death Row material thanks to some tapes from the big homie Tony Best (Whos in the credits on DPG \"Dogg Food\" & 2Pacs \"RU Still Down\") View the bottom of this page. Well Tonys lent me copies of his OWN collection, so here is the music ripped from CDQ sources, in its PUREST FORM & how the artists intended it to stay. Props TB!\n\nDaz Dillinger & Soopafly - 'Fresh'. Heres a 'Fresh Rmx' with a verse from Slip Capone. These tracks are pre Mobstyle, Daz Dillinger 'Niggaz Killin'. Daz Dillinger & Kurupt 'Cant Quit' (aka Tremendous Odds), some of those vocals were used on DPG 2002, but that was the complete original, Heltah Skeltah re-did a version of this for their Magnum Force CD. Heres Daz Dillinger 'The Name Or The Rep' (Not full, fuck bootleggers) another Daz solo that will never surface. 'Money Cars & Bitches' from Tha Dogg Pound. Ive got a load of original verions of tracks from Daz's 'Retaliation...' LP, there slightly different, before they were mixed up & ready. 'Ultimate Come Up' w/MC Eiht. 'Retaliation, Revenge & Getback'. Here's a 6 Minute version of 'Put The Monkey In It' by Daz & Soopafly. 'What Would U Do' (Crip mix) from Tha Dogg Pound. This is the Original Street Mix of 'Way Too Major' by Daz & Tray Deee from the Gang Reltaed OSt.\n\nHere are a couple old tracks from the Dogg. Snoop Dogg - 'Who Am I /Ext Dr Dre Rmx' and a clip from a track you havent got or heard 'The Pimp Life' .\n\nRight here is a Soopafly version of 'Tha Gz Come Out At Night' - 19th Street (Sho Shot, Legacy, Soopafly, Diceman & Crooked I). Its an unreleased one from 96. I know theres a version with C Style circulating, I can guarantee this one isnt.\n\n'I Got Ya Back' from Storm, the female MC who rapped on various 2pac/Deathrow records \"Mixed Nuts\" LP, that was produced by Herby \"Bigbug\" Azor of Salt N Pepa fame. This track was the 1st single & only got pressed up on Vynal, in limited numbers.\n\nThis is a very rare song 'Tribulations' E-40, Snoop Dogg, B-Ligit & 2Pac. This was aired on 106 KMEL in the bay area 2yrs ago. 40 said they recorded it the same time as \"Aint Hard 2 Find\" on All Eyez On me. It was supposed to end up on E-40's \"Charlie Hustle\". Heres a hot one from Thug Life titled 'Keep Um Running' from the Ghetto Politix comp (Lowrider Vid OST). On a side note does anyone remember the book 'The Killing Of Tupac Shakur'? with the autopsy & coroners report? which had pac's home address 8489 W.3rd St, Suite #1038, Los Angeles, CA. Which was then found out too be just an office building.\n\nHere are 2 unheard songs from the big dogs KMG & Big Hutch recorded not so long ago. Hella Connected & True That from Above The Law. Above the law make an appearence on Mac & A.K.s new one Money Rhymes. Heres Cheese a left over from 'To Gangsta For Radio' by Above The Law.\n\nLastly 2 old songs from soulstress Jewel, 'Memory Lane' & 'Check Yo Hood' with OFTB. 1st one is from the 'inside Out' compilation that only got pressed up in Vynal & was available for a very short period. Navarre Records dropped the dist rights to Death Row at the last minute. By the time they hooked up another distributor since priority were out of the picture, 'Chronic 2000' arose.\n\nRe-upped, \"Can't C Me\" from the Dogg Pound, which was orginally a track with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre for the Helter Skelter album that never came to be. Then DPG wanted it on their album Dogg Food as the fist single. But somebody (I won't name names!) decided that no Dre-produced track should appear on Dogg Food (Dre also did a remix of \"Dogg Pound Gangstas\" that was supposed to be on the album, which never saw the light of day), so the song was pulled, therefore this is a Dogg Food leftover. Then along comes 2Pac. After spending a day in the studio listening to tracks to be included on his All Eyez On Me album, he came across 3 Dre beats he liked: \"Cant C me\", \"BluntTyme\" (originally a song with 2Pac, Dre and Rage which later re-surfaced on the Aftermath compilation featuring RBX) and \"Cali Love\" which was orginally a solo song for Dre's new album The New World Odor: Papas Got a Brand New Funk. \"Blynt Tyme\" didn't make the final cut. But...after some persuasion Pac decided to go with \"Cali Love\" and \"Cant C Me\", so he erased the DPG vocals and Dre's second verse from those respective songs. In other words, you have a truly RARE song from the once-powerful Death Row Records. If and when the original \"Cali Love\" (with just Dre) and \"Blunt Tyme\" re-surface, they will immediately become collectors items. These are no speculations, just straight up facts. Thank Tony Best for the audio.\n\nThere you have it, Death Row at its finest!\n\nPS.\n\nThe music store I work for will be getting 25 ORIGINAL PRESSED COPIES of Nate Dogg's \"G-Funk Classics Vol.1\" released in very small quantites on DEATH ROW RECORDS in 97. The last 20 sold like Pam Fucks Tommy, so let me know asap & ill reserve you a one.\n\nBobby Mac\n\n3rd Oct 2001\n\nSome hot new releases on the way, Jackie Jasper drop's January, Dayton Family drop's December, God like out December, Icp out early next year.

He's only been doing that 'cos I'm in jail . Snoop needs a lesson in how to respect others.\"\n\nHe made similar threat to Dr Dre. \"Now he's on his own, who is gonna protect him from people like me?\" Knight said. Knight also revealed that, unbelievably, he still has another eight albums worth of Tupac material recorded before the rappers death.\n\n\"With all the Tupac stuff, we got all the different sides of him. The conscious 'Pac, the thugged out 'Pac and the more reflective, laid back 'Pac.\"\n\nprops Fred.\n\nKleptomaniac\n\n5th Sept 2001\n\nDeath Row is now known as Tha Row. Suge says that Â“Death RowÂ” referz to the labels back catalog, but everything released from now on will be known as Â“Tha RowÂ”. 105.9 WDTJ in Detroit has supposedly been payed out by Jay Z to diss Deathrow. They consistantly speak out on Suge & its apparently due to Jay's presence. Mac Shawn has a comp CD just released titled WorldWide Bosses & Playas. Truth Hurts puts her debut out in november. Wit Dre, R Kelly, Organised Noize & Dj Quik tweakin beatz. Truth Hurts, Dres next RnB star plays in SnoopÂ’s The Wash movie, shel have a single from Soundtrack to. Dre & Quik recently did a track with Mimi for the training Day soundtrack titled 'Put It On Me', the 2 big dogs plan on dropin a compilation cd early next year collaborating the original Death row inmates together again, Snoop, Dre, Dogg pound, DOC, Warren G, rage, Tray Dee, CPO etc. I heard its soundtrack for a hiphop movie. Lets hope Murder Was The case style!\n\nJonny Tanna\n\n4th Sept 2001\n\nJust for the record, Mark Morrison is basically signed to RMG PLC and NOT Directly to DeathRow records. RMG PLC distribute Deathrow's European division. Also a lil old info, E-40 did a track with kurupt and n2deep, which is a leftover from hall of game. The track is called gorilla milk and says Kurupt appears courtesy of DeathRow records.\n\nOG Nino Brown\n\n29th Aug 2001\n\nAs requested here are 2 songs from Da Bastardz 1996 EP, released on Death Row Records. \"Target Practice Niggas\" (Stream) Produced by K Solo. \"Em-Pha-Fucking-Red\" (Stream) Produced by Dr Dre.\n\nDa Bastardz was an East Coast project back in the day, when 'Death Row East' was set to happen. Part of the labels success was due to their artists originating from all over, former LA Posse affiliate Lady of Rage from VA, Kurupt was from Philly, Sam Sneed Pittsburgh, K Solo Brooklyn NY. Suge brought Eric B in from New York to be the president of Death Row East. RUN DMC were invited to become a part of Death Row, the night Tupac was shot, they were at club 662 in Las Vegas with the purpose of joining.\n\nHeres MC Hammer's single from last year \"Pop Your Collar\" (Stream). As you know Hammer was tight with Suge back in the 80's & part of the Death Row family in 96. Tho due to the problems at the label during that time & Suge not being able to market his artists as he does, he then moved on & created his indi label 'Defence'. Heres Hammer's version of \"Unconditional Love\" (Stream) which was originally a track from the late 2Pac, that appeared on Pac's Greatest Hits. Hammer DID record material with 2Pac, one track they did was a remake of the Ohio Players Skin Tight titled \"Too Tight\", it was Hammer's concept, but Pac wrote his verse & I believe brought in Ebony on background vocals.......\n\nYou Death Row Records fans will be pleased to know that there is life at the label. The latest addition to the roster is to be none other than the greatest MC/Producer/Songwriter of all time! Its not for me to say who, be looking for the new video from that likwit affiliate (whos been working with dude a lot recently), to see WHO !! !!!!. Suge isnt finished even if the artists in development are.\n\n\"Can't C Me\" (Stream) was orginally a track with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre for the Helter Skelter album that never came to be. Then DPG wanted it on their album Dogg Food as the fist single. But somebody (I won't name names!) decided that no Dre-produced track should appear on Dogg Food (Dre also did a remix of \"Dogg Pound Gangstas\" that was supposed to be on the album, which never saw the light of day), so the song was pulled, therefore this is a Dogg Food leftover. Then along comes 2Pac. After spending a day in the studio listening to tracks to be included on his All Eyez On Me album, he came across 3 Dre beats he liked: \"Cant C me\", \"BluntTyme\" (originally a song with 2Pac, Dre and Rage which later re-surfaced on the Aftermath compilation featuring RBX) and \"Cali Love\" which was orginally a solo song for Dre's new album The New World Odor: Papas Got a Brand New Funk. \"Blynt Tyme\" didn't make the final cut. But...after some persuasion Pac decided to go with \"Cali Love\" and \"Cant C Me\", so he erased the DPG vocals and Dre's second verse from those respective songs. In other words, you have a truly RARE song from the once-powerful Death Row Records. If and when the original \"Cali Love\" (with just Dre) and \"Blunt Tyme\" re-surface, they will immediately become collectors items. These are no speculations, just straight up facts. Thank Tony Best for the audio.\n\nHeres a couple tracks The Outlawz recorded on Death Row Records a little while back, Never Surrender and Thugs Only by Noble. Props to Stealth the Beatologist, he produced them & is selling the underground CD still, drop me an email if your interested.\n\nJonny Tanna\n\n11th JuLy 2001\n\nHey Y'aLL SoRry i JuSs Had 2 UpDate SinCe i NotiC'd Sooo Many sites MiSs'd ouT On sum MajOr News LateLy..

Hutch is in charge of production at Tha Row right now as Dre was back in tha day. He & Outlawz Â‘EDIÂ’ were the musical supervisors on 2PacÂ’s latest one Until the End of Time. Hutch basically learned from Dre during the early years, Which is why output on Dog Pound 2002 & Dead Man Walking is pure Death Row Flavor (something Chronic 2000 wasnÂ’t).\n\nDonÂ’t know if you know already but Kokane is readying his comeback. Now officially known as Mr Kane heÂ’s set to release \"Dr Jeckel & Mr Kane\" on DoggHouse later on. Acts lined up Dre, Snoop, Mystikal & D Angelo\n\nSnoop will release his Damani DaDa sneakers \"ThizzleÂ’sÂ”, in November, Hes followed Master P & P Diddy with his own line of shoes. Snoop is also planning to open a theme park Â‘DoggyLandÂ’.\n\nKleptomaniac ;)\n\nFirst & foremost, I would like to apologize to Damon X.\n\nRegarding our post (& flawlessmusic.com)about the Above The Law tentative title Life Of A Drug Dealer, which came directly from you. That was actually quoted on MTV. Yet you run your mouth off about our site on tharow's forum sayings its fake & were dumb etc. Can I ask you who you refer too here....\n\n(I think he (suge) should verbally lash out against all those who pretty much talked shit while he was in the belly of the beast, but let's see how much tallking these motherfuckers are gonna do when he's a free man. We'll see how gangster they really are.) Quote from DAMON X (thugspot.com) Your running your mouth a little to much buddy.\n\n(You can expect the most controversial album that Death Row has ever releasedand that Hip-Hop listeners have ever heard (u think?). I'm not talkin' the subject matter that Eminem and his crew speak about) they wont drop any shit until you take ur dick out they ass! you ATL groupie. Will we endure some more Watered Down overproofed thug shit that Death Row are getting known for? The guest's bastardized Pac's UTEOT, outlawz specially. Crooked I's recent output is no more than mediocre.\n\n(Well I've been a big fan of ATL since 1989. In fact the first 12\" I ever bought was \"Murder Rap b/w Another Executions). Didnt livin like hustlers come out 1990? you sound young. You just started titty-feeding when I picked up my first vynal. (you prolly remember this as the best time of your life, physical contact with a woman)\n\nI'm making a big deal out of a few small comments, but why should a pre-pubescent little scrote get on his high horse & accuse us as being retarded. Think before you write or the next time in your mouth wont be a cock, but a pickaxe, you bitch!\n\nSlap yourself!\n\nPEEP WCA FOR NEWS ON THE LATEST DEATH ROW INMATE\n\nGusto\n\nO2DeathRow live from mtv.com, rumors keep DR alive, remember when our site dissed that site fo reporting about DMX 3 out of 5 updates on a westcoast section, a day later they go & change it, tut tut.\n\n(following newz coutesy of rapmusic.com)\n\nUnreleased DPG material which is still under the deathgrip of Deathrow Records is currently being remixed by Deathrows' new secret weapon of producers :\n\n' THE EXECUTIONERS' [Darren Vegas, Big Hutch]\n\nLook for this remixed album to be extremely dope! [release date July 31st]\n\n(Remember when Daz and Kurupt first came out ? How hard and raw they sounded?)\n\nHeres what Daz had to say \"More power to them. I'm 'a get paid off it. I got a deal when I left that I walked with all [my masters]. They could put it out, but I still get all mine. I want to hear what he got.\"\n\nDr.DRE has reportedly produced 4 new tracks for Bizzy Bones' new upcoming album . This should be extremely dope! Also look for KRAZY, WISH, LAYZIE, DJQUIK, N LUDACRIS to be featured on the album set to be released towards christmas...\n\nSnoop has already shot scenes for his next XXX-Hip Hop Video [PartII]. We'll keep ya posted...\n\nNINO This is my last update. DREnt are sorting out some fonky shit with cats that used to run Death Row pages back in the day. They'l be back soon with loads more sections & way more info to peep. Maybe then Death Row will be back on top where they were back then. Be sho' to bounce back SOON!!!!\n\nAccording to dpgrecordz.com, Soopafly got an album dropping JUNE 17th on Dpg Records. Really cant wait, you know thats a classic already! Even if the webmaster (Daz?) is a retard, thanks for this email anyway, & the hit!\n\n2 K9 tracks we put up years ago, are floating around Napster, just edited out our tags with no props! I dont give a fuck, but we dont get many hits, jus would have been cool to have said where they came from. Anyway here's the 4th & best track from the Pre-Death Row Demo!\n\nPeople still hit me up asking whether Pac is still alive, cause of the track 'God Bless The Dead'. The lyrics \"Rest In Peace Biggy Smalls\" aren't directed at NY Rapper B.I.G. but another MC known as Biggy Smallz who passed in 94' I believe. This track was recorded on Death Row produced by Johnny J, but released independently on 12\" thru 'Life Records' check it out...\n\nHere's a few rare Dresta tracks from back in 99' I think you may like. Gangsta Gangsta featuring Val Young (Download). Keep It Crackin' featuring Bad Azz (Download). My Last Night (Download). Thanks to Dresta's Legal Rep's 'B.L.I' for the info. MP3 Versions of these will be available for download at WestCoastAftershock in a few days.\n\nI put up that brand new drop for Snoop Dogg's Radio over at WCA few weeks ago from 4 Life Records, here it is again features Tracy Deee, Too Cool, Leicy Locc, J-Dog and Young Bucc, produced by Dj Slip and J-Dog of 4life. Leicy Locc is Dresta & B.G Knockout's sister, heres a pic of her with Slip. Check this ride. The pix from the 4life jam 2 weeks ago will be up later check here, Snoop performed, Julio G MC'd the show, mad peoples there you'l luv these pics!\n\n'Smokin Tha Bud' Jewell feat Snoop Dogg is still up, the Jewel song that was playing in the background of Snoop's \"You Thought\" on the 'Doggfather' LP. They'l delete it soon, betcha!\n\nFormer inmate Jewel is also featured on Sheeba Black's 'Sheeba Baby' the tracks called \"Get Here\" prod by Trey Young, other producers on the CD include Krayzie Bone, Bobby Jones, Flawless and Twin.\n\nJT just informed me that Jewel's in a track with Missy on Redman's new album. She appears courtesy of vertex records.\n\nD-12's 'Devils Night' drops any day now, 19 track deep album with 4 tracks produced by Dre (Nasty mind, Aint nuttin but music, Fight music & Revelation) If you cop the UK version you'l get a gang of shyt on a bonus disc, CD Rom, 3 extra tracks etc.\n\nSomeone asked me if Mac Shawn ever dissed neone. Heres a wack clip from the dopeman himself Biggie Diss cant believe he said that.\n\nTharapscene got a cool remix of Crooked I's 'Death Rizzo' check that for sure.\n\nMy homey Bill from Chi Town Sounds put up this cool interview with Danny Boy when he left Death Row last and he put up the RnB Mix of You Take My Breath Away - DannyBoy feat. Danny Lerman released on Danny Lerman's album.\n\nWhats The Worst They Can Do? soundtrack is out. Snoop's got that song titled 'Fuck What They Say' on it. Doggy's Angels got one on there to called 'Shoot Em Up'.\n\nOkay Geoshities are nearly done deleting P's shyt. I just checked, herez basically the only ones they've left up, right click on the song and copy shortcut, then paste it into your address bar & hit return:\n\nTech N9nes remix of 'Questions' which showed up on his \"The Calm before The Storm\" record. The original is on DeathRow's \"Gang Related\".\n\nThe best cut from Miilkbone's 96' debut album \"Da Miilkrate\", 'Wherez Da Party At'. If you dig this you'l luv Little Shawn's 'Dom Perignon' (Bad Boy 95). Ive got a spare copy of this is anyone wants it, holler ogninobrown@hotmail.com\n\nI think everyone slept on this lil 92.3 Freestyle from Daz back in 97'. If so there you go. Also Slip Capone's freestyle Bouncin'.\n\nThey left this shit up, Tupeu De Borfash . Bite of Pac's 'Made Niggaz' from some Romanian group . LOL you know I like this!\n\nThese next tunes you need to right click on the song and copy shortcut, then paste it into your address bar (or paste into your real player location bar).\n\nMatt upped these back in 99. Soopafly 'Who's world is it?'. 2Pac featuring Tammi 'Ghetto' (remix of I wonder if heavens got a ghetto). Both from 'Mike Moselys 'Platinum Plaques'.\n\nSome more, 'Aint Died In Vain' by Rondo and Outlawz, from Rondo's 'Success before death'. 'Games' from 'Funk Fo Life' by J Sweats, Cool E and Outlawz.\n\nLastly just a thought, I'd luv to see the guy that blew up 'Chronic 2000 & Too Gangsta'. (NaughtyByNature's) TREACH drop a solo album on Death Row. Thats an original right there, put it down on deathrow shit back in 93. Drop a single feat Crooked I. Just go bump 'Chronic 2000' with V.K & imagine a fuckin Album!!!! That shit could take the Row past where it left off, serious. Followed by a Crooked I diss free record. 3rd Above The Law LP or Pac, fuck this Dpg 2002 bullshit, hell dont even cop that, you got they money, leave them bitches alone. Did I hear former Death Row artist Tha Realest once say \"I dont juss smash for any unapparent reason imma get at you for a real reason, You dont diss just to be dissing\"...Fuck Hollywood? Jada Pinket? Magic Johnson? Tevin Campbell? If you have a problem with weak rap, fuckin act on it, dont take backward steps with petty disses, damn. MAKE A HIT RECORD THEN DISS!\n\nLike I said, thats my last update. Check back sometime soon tho, bomb new page! pleasebelieveit. Heres some websites I recommend you hit up in the meantime.

Then Danny Boy is officially off of Tha Row, and he can look for a good deal elsewhere. I got 2 Danny Boy songs this update. The first one is the slow and tight Come When I Call (Remix). The next one is a more recent song. Its called You Take My Breath Away with Danny Lerman, a saxophonist.\n\nDanny Boy Â– Come When I Call (Remix)\n\nDanny Boy & Danny Lerman Â– You Take My Breath Away\n\nLast up we got a different version What Would You Do by Tha Dogg Pound.

Keep checking back here for my overview and thoughts on the Rolling Stone article. Im out! Swoop C\n\nO.G. NINO BROWN\n\n(Courtesy of WestCoast Aftershock)\n\nReggae vocalist Joe appeared on numerous projects throughout his under-rated career. Featuring on several albums such as Dogg Pound Dogg Food, Daz Dillinger Retaliation, Revenge And Get Back, Bad Azz Word On Tha Street, Gonzoe If I Live And Nothing Happens, Makaveli 7 Day Theory. He revolutionized a sound that fused Reggae/HipHop.\n\nAlthough the album was slept on, the single United got shown mad love from MTV. Ive uploaded a gang of tracks from it as respect to Joe. I know he'd want his music to be heard by everyone!. Pure Reggea infected Rastaman Vibration. Heres a clip from Happy People (feat. London Community Gospel Choir). Joe possesed the ability to come with so many different styles, here's the balled In Love (featured in the movie \"Renaissance Man\"). The soulful Love Of A Mother features former Death Row Records vocalist Jewel. The dark, inspiring Into The Light. Heres a clip of the fonky In The 90's. Lastly the title track Life In The Streets (Also featured in the film, \"Renaissance Man\"). Please take time out & listen to these.\n\nJoe wrote all his lyrics with references to Politics & Dominica, he Co-Produced the song Love of a Mother. He'l be missed by fans all over, though like all lost souls, hes looking down on us proud. Rest in peace!\n\nAudio courtesy of www.westcoastaftershock.com\n\nJonnY TannA\n\nWuTz PoPpin' PpL...??

NINO BROWN\n\nCONGRATULATIONS to my boyee Matty Jory whos getting hitched to his bitch, good lookin' out man!!!!. Yer as you know the NEW DPG CD has dropped, go scoop that. Only been waiting 6 years!\n\nAbove The Law will be releasing their album on Death Row late this summer, its titled 'Life Of A Drug Dealer' and cuts include colab's with Crooked I & K9. props to Damon X for that.\n\nAight here it is, some of the tightest unreleased Death Row shit around str8 from the archives O.F.T.B's 'Time After Time' featuring Kurupt, Kadafi & 2Pac (OG Version). Most people are unaware that theres 2 versions this song, so heres the other one 'Time After Time' with new lyrics, I believe Bus tweaked that too.\n\nProps to everyone who promoted 'Until The End of Time'. I wanna re-up my favorite cut, the original Dj Quik remix of 'Words 2 My First Born'. You'l notice the chorus didnt make the CD & Above The Law arnt featured. Ive been told the reason for this was due to the amount of commercial happy hooks Quik was asked to switch shyt up, so they brought in Above The Law & came up with one of the best joints from the album. Enjoy!\n\nPlaya Hamm from The Penthouse Players Clique released his debut solo LP 'Layin Hands'. '2 da curb' features Jewel.\n\nJulio G premiered this next one last year then hit the net thru The Foeground, Above The Law's 'Cheese'. This was their first track recorded on Death Row which was supposed too have shown up on \"Too Wack For Radio\".\n\nOkay Westcoast2k have dropped snippits of 3 New Crooked I joints. K9 has just finnished a track for Crooked I's Abum. Too say he's one of the tightest lyricists out west why the fuck is he following Tha Fakest & dustin off with this shit.... \"You Say You RAW (Daz's LP) But Naw I Aint Feelin Ya\". What the fuck is this? Has Daz done a drop for a Flash Infected Internet Website? umm I'm saying nothing, peace'\n\nSWOOP C\n\nSup?? This is swoop C again. This time we got some exclusive Death Row news for ya'll. I was talking to K-9's manager and he has told me that K-9 spent last month in jail. K-9 went to jail for having weed on him, a direct violation of a past probation. He spent a little over a month, but it was nothing serious. Death Row did not support K-9 while he was in jail, but now everything is kool with them. The main focus with k-9 is his group called The Lost Souls. They are going to sign to a label sometime soon, Jive or Death Row are the most prominent takers right now. He also said that the Lost Souls are messing with Juvenile right now. No matter what label Lost Souls signs to, k-9 will be apart of the group. Thanks a lot to k-9's manager for this info, it was much appreciated. U heard it here first, Death Row Entertainment. 'Nuff Said. Swoop C\n\nSWOOP C\n\nWutz Crackin?? Im Swoop C, the newest face from Death Row Entertainment. U may also know me as MarshColin.\n\nIm gonna start my first update off with a bang. I'm world premiering a song from the Bones Soundtrack. This is the first track that you will hear from Bones. NO OTHER SONGS HAVE BEEN HEARD YET! Your getting it right here, at Death Row Entertainment. That's right, another premier. So here it is:\n\nKendrick feat. Big CPO - This Is My Life (Right Click on the Link and click on copy shortcut. Paste it into the address bar on your browser and hit enter and it should work)\n\nKendrick is the latest signee to Doggystyle Records, and then there's CPO, Need I say more? That's not 100% sure about Kendrick and Doggystyle, but its very reliable. That news comes str8 from my nigga Rick who hooked up the track. He also hooked me up with the original version of Head Doctor by Snoop which most of u got cuz I leaked it. Big ups to Rick.\n\nI have this song in near CD quality, but there is always those people that steal. So, like we always do here, give it to u in shit quality. If u want to trade me for my better quality version hit me on the email, MarshColin@aol.com.\n\nYou all probably know that Julio G was fired from 100.3 Tha Beat. Well, I got some info on why he was fired. I was told that he was not playing the music he was supposed to play on his show. For example, he played West Coast Gangsta Shit instead of that mainstream bullshit from tha East Coast. He also appeared on people's albums, which he was not supposed to do. That's pretty much all I know on that.\n\nExpect more news and updates from me in the future. We're closed for about a month. When we reopen we'll have lots of sections and stuff to browse thru. That's all for this update.\n\nPEACE! Swoop C\n\nO.G. NINO BROWN\n\nThere isnt much worth reporting on the current situation at Death Row. So let's dig deep.....\n\nAnyone remember \"Emmage\"? There featured on Comptons Most Wanted's 1992 release 'Music To Driveby' track 15 'U'z A Bitch' (click to listen) take a look in the credits & you'l see Emmage appears courtesy of DEATH ROW RECORDS. Back in the day, there used to be a bunch of groups signed to Death row. Emmage was one of them. Also The Convicts (Big Mike and Lord 3-2) were going to be one of the first ones with a release, but they went back to Rap-A-Lot.\n\nDj Slip (Comptons Most Wanted) was one of the original staff producers for the label. It was Slip, Dr. Dre, DJ Unkown,Rhythm D, and Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor.\n\nAnother thing you might not know is the fact that the homie Slip created the name. It was originally going to be \"Def Row\" i.e. \"Def Jam.\" Unknown went and copywrote the name Slip created and sold it to Suge and Dre for $5000. You can check the info for yourself and see that there is a trademark on both Def Row and Death Row.\n\nNEWS!!NEWS!!NEWS!!!! Bad Azz, Kurupt & Outlawz were on JT Tha Bigga Figga & Mac Mall's Soundtrack 'Beware Of Those' If you slept. Lady of Rage is still doin her thing, she's on Boo Ya T.R.I.B.E's new one 'Mafia Lifestyle' (Mighty Boo Ya. I think). Bad Azz's second LP 'Personal Business' will drop July 31st.\n\nMy man Dj Run has finally finnished Dresta's new site WWW.DRESTA.COM . Bookmark that page for some crunked up audio & news on Dre'tsa the Gangsta.\n\nKMG's (Above The Law) Ear Candy EP, is set to become a full 15 track LP later this year. Thats dope news cause the EP is bangin' You can buy it from mp3.com & some small stores around Cali. I'll hook up some audio from it next time. Thanks to Damon X for that info...\n\nRemember Snoop talking (murder was the case movie) about the track 'Long Beach is a muthafucka' . Thats's a (fucked up) clip ripped from Vynal.\n\nFinally 2PAC fan's will be pleased to know he'l be making an appearance on Coco Brovaz new album. Probably a recycled track from One Nation. Stay tuned to the website 4 more\n\ninfo....\n\nSorry about the long delay. Updates may not be so frequent for the next month or 2, right now our news is slept on & audio bootlegged. Jon's fuckin pissed at at the exposure we get too. Were working on a brand new layout & a new project as soon as Suge touches out. Thanks to Hitemup.com for that post last month........Peace, Love & Funkyness.... Nino\n\nO.G. NINO BROWN\n\nI've been gettin mad emails wanting some more of that unheard shit, so heres a few more bits for all u real Death Row Pimpalistic Playas out there........ First up u got an old R'n'B track from Jewell produced by Snoop. You'l love this, check it out... 'Smokin Tha Bud' - Jewell feat Snoop Dogg. Next up heres another old tune from 96', Jodeci's remix of Get On Up featuring Tha Dogg Pound 'Get On Up Rmx' - Jodeci feat Dogg pound.\n\nOne of the many chumps over at the official Death Row forum spread a rumor that Dj Quik had been shot. This cant be true cause it hasnt hit the news. Speaking on sad news though, Papi Chulo AKA Son Doobie of Funkdoobiest was recently shot during an attempted robbery at a barbershop in his LA neighbourhood, luckily he's ok & expected to make a full recovery.\n\nIn brighter news,Thanks to Stealth from Beatology who hooked me up with this undergound Outlawz joint 'Dont Cry' he produced. Beatology producers (Stealth - K.M.G (Above The Law) - Cold 187um (Above The Law) - Martin Johnson & D Mac) have worked with many of today's established platinum recording artists such as ATL, E-40, 2Pac, Ice Cube, Eazy E, Kokane, Kid Frost, NWA, Michel'le & Dr. Dre on 2001 'Pause For Porno'. I think he's still selling the 'Beatology Underground CD', let me know if you wanna get @ him.\n\nWhy couldnt this have been on the new Pac CD? 'They Dont Give A Fuck About Us' - 2pac feat Outlawz.\n\nHeres a funky as fuck unreleased Snoop track from 98' prod by Meech 'Never Again' - Snoop Dogg. That was dope as fuck, another mad ass Death Row diss, yeeee FUCK IT UP SNOOP!!!\n\nJULIO G'S \"WESTSIDE COMPILATION ALBUM\" Dang! how much longer do we gotta wait.

I like both of these a lot, ive upped them in shit quality with tags just too piss off bootleggers. Sadly though here's a clip from Track 3, yet again death Row cant put somethin together without a pathetic diss. \"Biggies name was on the hitlist, Puff kicked it & broke, left his boy to get smoked, shouldnt have came back to Cali playin the row for some joke\"...(Yawn)...\"Mobb Deep, Jay Z, Puffy, Mase, Lox\" LOL, thats is hilarious, speakin up on materialistic acts like that only bring you down into that category pal.

And it's pritty wellknow now that Snoop and Daz Dillinger, his cousin, will not be working together now.

According to an article in the Thursday edition of \"The Los Angeles Times,\" investigators at the LAPD currently suspect that former officer David A. Mack might have met with Death Row Records' CEO Marion \"Suge\" Knight to arrange a contract killing of Wallace. Mack, who is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence for robbing $722,000 from a bank in November 1997, is also suspected of hiring a former University of Oregon classmate, Amir Muhammad, to perform the hit on Biggie Smalls. Authorities have apparently been unable to locate Muhammad since he visited Mack in prison the day after Christmas in 1997. According to the article, police documents indicate that an eyewitness has placed Mack at the scene of the March 1997 shooting by someone who was riding in the same motorcade as Biggie, and Mack apparently drove a car similar to the dark-colored Chevrolet Impala that was seen driving away from the shooting. Mack grew up in the same neighborhood in Compton as Knight and has refused to cooperate with officials involved in the Smalls investigation. The LAPD has spent the last two years attempting to build a case against the ex-officer. Knight is currently serving a nine-year sentence for violating a probation charge that was the result of a 1992 attack on two rappers at a Hollywood studio. The former Death Row Records chief broke the probation when he took part in a 1996 assault on a man at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The LAPD has yet to formally charge anyone for the fatal shooting of Notorious B.I.G., although various theories have suggested that the killing was the result of an East Coast-West Coast feud between rival rap labels, or over a money dispute between Wallace and the L.A. gang the Southside Crips. I just hope Suge didnt have anything to do with this,if he did Death Row wont survive.And if he did he should of tryed and did it better.\n\nAight i know it's been a long time coming but here are my first ever real audio cuts, upped my me!.The first two cuts are from 'Mike Moselys Platinum Plaques'.'Who's world is it?' by Soopafly is first, then we got 'Ghetto' by Makaveli feat.

More later.\n\nGHETTO PREACHER\n\nNate Dogg has released a 'new' album called 'Ghetto Preacher'. I wouldnt buy this album if i were you as it's just another re-packaged version of 'G Funk Classics Vol.1' an now has 'Nobody does it better' with Warren G on. It's out on Nate's Doggfoundation Entertainment.\n\nYesterday the 'One Nation' tribute concert for Tupac was held. Sadly the concert it's self was very disorganised. There was alot of problems with sound and stage lighting which ment it was held back for an hour. Mac Mall did a tight set as did Ray Luv. The Outlawz did the tightest set whitch included some new songs from 'Still I Rise', the songs were 'Homeboys' and 'Hell for a hustla', other songs they did included 'Bomb First','Life of an Outlaw' and a new new version of Fatal's Everyday'. The Oulawz gave a few promo's out but one guy throw it back and started saying some shit to the Outlawz then Fatal jumped in the crowd and beat the guy's ass down and EDI had to be restained.Yukmouth was there but he didnt perform and Digital Underground just pissed the crowd off. Talking of 'Still I Rise', it will be released on Monday the 20th in most parts of Europe.\n\nIs Tupac alive? well on a new track offa 'Still I Rise' called 'Killuminati' Tupac say's \"Wonder why these niggaz crossed me, I'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me, now Biggie died, everytime I ride it's for reasons, all you bitch ass niggaz, I'm comin back like Jesus.\" I aint saying shit on this, it's up to you to decide.\n\nTHA NEW SHIT\n\nHere is some news on some dope albums dropping soon. Bay area rappers Killa Tay and Guce have got a group called 'Bully's Wit Fullys' and will be dropping a album called 'Westside Stories', Tha Outlawz, Yukmouth, 3X Krazy's Agerman and Young Droop among others will all feature on this album. Mac Shawn's homie Lil Bruce of Funk Mobb will drop his second album 'Give It To Me Baby'. This album looks blazing with guest spots from Mac Shawn,B Legit,Tha Outlawz and Thug Life. Props to Red for that news.\n\nAs first reported by DR2K 'Still I Rise' has been pushed back to the 21st of decmember. This has been confirmed Interscope.\n\nAnother album thats been pushed back is Willie D'd 'Loved By Few,Hated By Many', this has been pushed back to 18th of January 2000. Thats a shame as Tha Outlawz, Hurt Em Badd and Spice 1 were all gunna be on the album, the main reason for this is Rap-A-Lot have just been droped by Virgen. They are trying to work out a long turm deal with Priority. Despite all the set backs they just set a releases date of Febuary 8th for the still untitled Big Syke album.\n\nI should be getting a trade page up soon, more details soon.\n\nCD Now have just put up Inside Out up for order, go check it out!

Y'all Don't Know Us\n\nShit I can't wait for this to drop!\n\nLAST MEAL\n\nSnoop Dogg has recently stated that his next album will be called 'Last Meal' and will drop some early next year, before July 4th. With a title like that it makes you think if he is wanting to leave No Limit.\n\nDeath Row and Amaru have set a release date of December 14th for the Tupac and Outlaw album, 'Still I Rise'. I just hope this drops in time.\n\nA new soundtrack is set to drop soon soon called 'High Frequency' and will feature Tha Outlawz, Mac Shawn and Yukmouth among others.\n\nRemember to go pick up Kurupt Young Gotti's album 'Street Iz A Mutha' on Tuesday, along with Dr Dre's 'Chronic 2000' and 'They Call Me Kane' by Kokane\n\nB-Legit's album 'Hempin Aint Easy' has been pushed back until early 2000.\n\nON WITH THA NEWZ\n\nSupp. Sorry for the long lack of updates. I've been real busy, with all this tight ass westcoast shit dropping over the last few weeks or so. Now the news\n\nDeath Row might still get one more album out before the end of the year. They still arnt sure what to put out but the three front runners are Soopfly, Tha Outlawz or Tha Dogg Pound. I'd really like to see all three albums drop soon but i'd setal for any one of these before the end of the year.\n\nI just got Dr. Dre's Chronic 2001 (yes he's renamed it again) and let's say...... it's good, but not great. The album could have been a lot better, I thinkm Dre has went for quantity and not quality, dont get me wrong it is a GOOD album. There have been alot more albums out this year that have been better. I'm really liking Dre's new 'Snoop' Tha Hittman, I hope he has a album set to drop soon. Also on Aftermath news, i hear the diggity Doc has signed a writing deal with Dre. So maybe some of them rhymes on the new Dre album were ghost-writen by The D.O.C. I wish his voice never got fucked up.\n\nCrooked I is still not a Death Row Inmate and has lest 19th Street Records and is unsigned. His legal reps. at Black Law Instatute passed that on to me.\n\nBay area producer Mike Mosely has just dropped a compaltion album called 'Platinum Plaques' which features a remixed version of 'Heavens got a ghetto' by 2Pac and 'Who's world is it' by Soopafly,others on this album include TQ, Yukmouth,and C Bo.\n\nIn some shocking azz news 2Pac, yes 2pac is going to be on Biggie small's new album. This news knocked me fo' six when i heard it. The track will be a remixed version of 'House of pain', which also has Stretch on it. This is real funny news as i heard that one track on the album 'West side story' which features Lil Kim and Puffy Daddy, will be a 2pac diss. Is it me or is 'Pac's moms out for cash?\n\nA track by the Outlawz and Spice 1 has turned uo on two compaltions albums, 'Mob Files' and 'Comp Files' have the track 'We got guns'.\n\nSAME OLD SHIT\n\nThere aint that much news at the moment,so here are a few tit-bits fo' all ya westcoast hoggz.But first off i gotta give some madd propz to tha homiez Playa P and G-Locc.Thanx fo puting me up on tha game.Ya sites will be madly missed.Tell Tha 'Pound i said whats up!\n\nTha Dogg Pound will release there second album this summer on Gang File Records.Daz Dillinger will be the executive producer. Thanx to Playa P fo that. talking of Daz he's on the new South Central Cartel album.I'll try nad get some more info on that.\n\nTha homie G-Locc found this lil' page on Crooked I . Go check it out.\n\nA new compalation album will drop soon called 'Comp Files' it will feature Tha Outlawz,Snoop Dogg,B-legit and many more of tha west's finest. Tha Outlawz are on Bay area rapper Rondo's self title album,the track is called 'Succses before death'.\n\nBig Syke is on a new compalation called 'Cross counrty ridaz' , while fellow Thug Life member, Rated R has a track on Coolio's Crowbar compaltion,the track's called 'Watch what u do'\n\nAlso if any one can hook me me up with a cd-r of Eminem's Infinate and Slim shady ep,let me know\n\nBACK IN THE HOUSE\n\nSorry for the lack of updates,iv been REAL busy gettin' my party on,and stil am, just taking a days brake.anyway on with a few bits of news\n\nLook's like Sam Sneed will be getting the help he needs with his treatment,East coast nutball ,Busta Rhymes has kindly donated around $10,000 to Sam's fund.Dr Dre is also said to be helping to put out a fund raising album out with other big rap stars and there will be a concert in aid of Sam somtime soon. Im real glad to see everyone rally round Sneed in these bad times\n\nI keep hearing that Snoop Dogg will be releasing a greatest hits album on Death Row at the end of the year,as much as id like to see that,i really dout Death Row would put there time and energy in to putting out any kind of album that would help Snoop in any way,remember that Snoop has a ablum out at the start of 2000.\n\nI just want to say a big 'fuck you' to Bad Azz, as we all know by now Bad Azz is sueing Death Row and the estate of 2Pac.If you ask me it's just sour grapes as Afeni nor Death Row would clear the original version of Ghetto star to be used on Bad Azz's album 'Word on the street'\n\nIn some grat news, Thug Life's Big Syke has signed a deal with the second best record label's, Rap-a-lot.He joins some great rappers on the label such as Tela,KB,Yukmouth and of course the great Outlaw Immortalz.Scarfaces last Rap-a-lot solo album, 'In my time of dying' will be out around October time\n\nTIME TO RIDE\n\nTha Realest's album will be released in early 2000.The current title from the album will have somthing to do with angels in the tile, something like 'Dark Angel' or 'Evil Angel'.He will ride on that No Talent bitch C-Murder.Talking of C-Murder he is set to appear on Kurupt's new album, now called 'Street's in a Mutha' what the fuck is Kurupt doing?\n\nIncase y'all didnt know Suge has been yet again been denied a chance to get out of the pen, i dont know why this happened because Suge was told before that he had a good cahnce of getting out because of good behavier.Expect a apeal to happen soon, as the Row will try to gear up to the year 2000.\n\nThe Outlawz album is still going to be Death Row's next release,there is a chance that the album may not come out for awhile as Interscope are still holding back on the release of this and the next Tupac album,if they still hold out expect to see Soopafly's first and last Death Row album around October\n\nDaz's DPG Records have now officly parted from Death Row,this means that there will never be a offical Dogg Pound album as Death Row owns the rights to the pound's name,so if Kurupt and Daz release a album togeter they will have to use a new name.It is still not known if Mac Shawn has left Death Row with DPG has his original contract was with Death Row\n\nThe new compalation album 'Escape from Death Row' looks like it could be Bad Azz's crew the Low Lifes album.It is still unknown if the album is going to be a diss toward Death Row it's self.\n\nTQ and British boy band/R&B group Another Level do not use the beat from unreleased Tupac cut 'Play your cards right' for their new single 'Summertime'.I'v heard this song many times and they do not sound alike in way.\n\nTHE REAL\n\nStill i rise will not drop before late September,but there is one thing, Still i rise is NOT a 2pac album it is the Outlawz solo album,with some 2pac songs on.Death Row will then release 2pac's album around October or November.The Outlawz will then be free of there Death Row contracts and will drop 'Neva Surrenda' on Rap-a-lot Records.This piece of news come's straight from the row\n\nI haer Doug E.Fresh will drop a few vinyl joints on Death Row, so that heads in the east will get back into Death Row.This move will not go into anything big as there are no plans for Doug to drop a album on Death Row,it's a move that will get Dj's to play more Death Row records and Doug may do concerts will Death Row's help.The move,if it goes through will be very similer to what Death Row had wanted to do with Mc Hammer.\n\nPlaya P tell's me that Swoop G makes a few guest spots on 3X Krazy's new album 'Imortalized',P just hooked me up with their last album 'Stakin Chips' which Swoop appear's on the track 'Pistol's Blazin'.looks like another album im gunna have to get.\n\nBULLSHIT\n\nThe resent Still i rise track list that has been going around the internet for the past few day's total bullshit.This has been confirmed by Death Row,the album should be out in Augest some time,the 17th or the 24th.\n\nDEATH ROW CONCERT\n\nThis past Friday Death Row had a concert in Portland,the line up included Tha Realest,Lil C Stle,Daz Dillinger,Soopafly,Tray Dee anf the newest Death Row inmate Crooked I. Later in the week,my homie G-locc reports the Dogg Pound also had a concert.\n\nA lil more Tech N9ne info fot you all,that comes from Lonney.The album is 15 tracks deep and includes a different version of Questions.It came out on Midwest Records and Don Juan and Boss Hogg aka Dymannd Shields produce the most of the album.The album is suppost to be hot.I cant wait till my copy is sent by Cdnow.\n\nFor the downlow on the new Warren G album go to The G Funk Page\n\nY'all should go and check out my homie Eddie's page WestCoast Mobbin it will be fully open soon.\n\nAlso on a quick note if you didnt already know www.deathrowrecords2000.com is the new offical homepage.\n\nKANE & ABLE INMATES?\n\nI am getting some reports that ex-Hoe Limit group, Kane and Able are very close to signing with Death Row,i realy hope this is not true as these two bitches have no talent like most of there former label mates.If you don't remember Kane and Able 'remade' Tupac's 'Soulja's Story' and called it somthing like 'No limit soldier'.Talking of Hoe limit, Mster P's greatest hits will be called 'Only God can judge me' again this shows Master P's shame less jocking of Tupac,No Limit also plan to release a christmas album,i wonder which label has done that before.\n\nOn some good news, if it's true, i hear Piggie Small's murder case has been officaly closed.If it's true this is great news for Suge Knight because he would stand a better chance to get of jail.\n\nI hear that Swoop G's album will be Death Row's second release of 2000.His album will be called 'Backstabers' and will have the usual Death Row guests.\n\nTech N9ne finally released his album 'Calm before the strom' this past Tuesday, on word who appears on the album\n\nLIFE GOE'S ON\n\nDoggnet have got the Life Goe's on Clean version ,also from Doggnet is one of my faverate unreleaed Tupac tracks, Die which features Nuttso,Scar-locc and Kurupt.\n\nI hear Master P is trying to sign Blac Haze to Hoe Limit.if y'all don't know Blac Haze is a Tupac soundalike,he has a pritty good flow,but it is another example of P trying to live offa Tupac.Here are afew Blac Haze downloads for ya Let me Holla at cha .this a tight track,i hear that his lable EKG records will release his new album soon.\n\n2PAC IMPORT\n\n2Paconline reports a new 2Pac import from Japan has been released called 'After life' it has all the old remixed tracks like 'Stop the gunfight' and 'Be the realest' and new unheard tracks like 'Californaian hustler' and 'Ooh wee'.Hopefully Cdnow will get this in soon with some clips put up. And in other Pac new's that has not been confirmed the new album will be called 'Still I rise' and will be out on August the 25th.\n\nDRE SUE'S THE ROW\n\nDr Dre is sueing Death Row and Priorty Records.His reason's,false designation of origin and false description,fedaral trade mark dilution,state statury unfair competiton,state common law trademark infrigement,common law trademark dilution,constructive trust,frad and breach of contract.Wanna know why, one word,the word, you ask, the word is CHRONIC.Dre thinks when people think of the Chronic they think of him, i don't know about you, but when i hear the word the Chornic i think of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Death Row Records.The suite later goes on to say that Death Row basicly put the words Chronic 2000 on the compatlaion because they found out that he and his company Aftermath where gonig to put out a album Chronic 2001.Dr Dre's suite wants to stop the manufacture,distribution,advertisement and sale of The Choronic 2000 'Still Smokin'.He also wants a undisclosed amout of dollars.This suite is very bad news for Death Row,hopfully nothing more will come of the case and people will see Dre for what he really is a money hungruy hoe.\n\nI WANT IT ALL\n\nI hear Warren G's upcomig album 'I want it all' will hace cameo's by Dr Dre,Snoop Dogg,Nate Dogg,Dove Shack and Mack 10.The album should drop on September 27th\n\nI hear 'Confessions' by Tupac and Bizzy Bone has been getting a lot of play in and around the Portland area.This may bee the 1st single from the upcoming Tupac/Outlawz album.Here is a track that is on a few bootlegs at the moment, Ha the remix by Juvenile feat.Tupac , Biggie Smalls and Grad Pupa.\n\nWAR WOUNDZ DELAYED\n\nThe new Tupac album has now been put on hold because of differences between Death Row and Interscope.The main problem is financial.The album could drop in August or it may not drop,my bet it will come out because both parties will get payed very well from a 2pac album.If/When the album drops it will not be called 'War Woundz', it is now untitled.This newz came from Nate,the co-web master of Death Row's offical website.\n\nDAZ OFF THA ROW\n\nIt seems that Daz has again left Death Row.I was told he was pritty pissed because his album and Soopafly's keep getting put back.His lable DPG Records will now not go throught Death Row but Priority.Hopfully if this is true DPG Records should have a album out before the end of the summer.This news also puts the next Dogg Pound album up in the air\n\nI hear Crooked I, might have signed to Death Row,he's currently on Big C-Style's 19th Street Records.I expect that if there is any true in this rumuer that he will be on Death Row/19th Street.Talking of 19th Street i hear Dresta has now left the lable.\n\nWHO DO U BELIEVE IN?\n\nFirst off, id like to say thanks to Nate from the Death Row website.Also anybody who has said he was'nt one of the webmaster's of the site to shut the fuck up, i have first hand proof that he is.The new website should be up soon.Also Death Row are about to go ahead and shoot the video for 'Who do you believe in',this is one video that MTV will play, which will promote The Chronic 2000 'Still smokin' and maybe inturn 'War Woundz'.\n\nNEW ALBUM TO BE SINGLE\n\nThe new 2Pac album 'War wounds' will be a single and not a double album, so it looks like it will be a 'Pac solo album with a few Outlawz posse cuts on.\n\nMORE 'PAC AND 'LAWZ NEWZ\n\nIn case y'all didnt know the new Tupac and Outlawz albbum is going to be called 'War wounds'.It will be on Death Row/Interscope records.Tha homie G-Locc tells me that it will be one disc of the Outlawz album and the other a solo Makaveli album.I can't wait.\n\nG-Locc sadly reports that Soopafly's album has been delayed, i was really hoping that this would come out on time as Soopafly has stuck with Death Row for a long time.It looks like Daz's 'What it is' will be Death Row's next release, after that Death Row plan to put out two more albums, hopefully they will be Soopafly's 'Like it or not' and 'Tha Underworld' compalation.\n\nDr Dre's 'Chronic 2001' will now drop August 3rd.Lokk for Daz and Warren G to make special guest spots on the album. P GETTING SUED\n\nMaster P is getting sued by a producer who claims he was forced to release Mia X out of a contract.If he refused,his small label would never go anywhere, Master P 'told' Roy Joseph,who has filled the $10 million case against P. I dont know why anybody would want to admit they had to be forced to release Mia X out of a contract, i would of payed some to take her.\n\nCharlie Hustle, E-40's soundtrack ,is set to drop this summer, but it look's like Tupac will not be on it now.Also i'm told that Mac Shawn may pop up on one or two song's.\n\n2PAC AND THE OUTLAWZ\n\nInterscope have set a release date, of August 17th, for a album called '2PAC AND THA OUTLAWZ'.It is unknown if this will be on Death Row or Amaru. I think this may be a double disc,one disc beeing a 'Pac solo album the 2nd disc Outlaw and Tupac songs.\n\nG-Note, formaly of Mac Shawn's group 'Funk Mobb' has signed to Ho Limit.He now goes by the name Lil' Italy.He has a album called 'On top of da world' which is out on August 3rd.I don't think Mac Shawn will appear on this album for one reason or another.\n\nEx LBC Crew member Techiec, is set to drop his solo album '18 and over' on Hoo Bangin records this summer.Expect to see Snoop Dogg, Bad Azz,Boo Kapone and Mack 10.Other bomb album's out this summer are Short Khop's 'Khop shop',Bad Azz's 'Personal business' and 'Ghetto hiesman'.\n\nSwoop G will make two guest spots on 3X Krazy's new album 'Immortalized'.Mac Shawn may also appear.\n\nHere are a few cuts from Da Playaz Krib .First we got One more shot by D-shot with Mac Shawn and Lil Malik. After that we got Put the monkey in it by Daz and Soopafly, thrid is Fuckin' with the wrong nigga by Makaveli and last is Don't be foolish by Snoop and Tha Dogg Pound.\n\nThe G-funk family reports that Warren G's album 'I want it all' is out on September 28th.\n\nHere's a funny ass version of Eminem's 'My name' by The Insane Clown Posse. 'Slim Anus'\n\nRINGIN' THA ROW\n\nI gave Death Row a call the other day to see what was gonig dow. I asked what the next release would be, the woman i talked to said \"We dont know what the next album is,we are working on a number of projects and don't know what the next release will be\".I asked if J-Flexx was still on the Row, answer \"Sorry i don't know \".I heard that Miilkbone had already been dropped,so i asked if he was still on the Row,she said \"Sory im not realy sure\".I asked why Chocolate Bandit had left, the woman did'nt know who he was never mind why he left.I think Death Row need to put a lot of work-in to there public relation"
