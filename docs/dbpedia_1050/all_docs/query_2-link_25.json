        "text": "Coming at you again with another incredible singer-songwriter that your playlist is missing. This time it’s up-and-coming 18-year-old, Phoenix native, Izzy Mahoubi. She grew up listening to Tom Petty, Taylor Swift and The Beatles, the most iconic trio if you ask us, and through them she fell in love with songwriting. You can definitely hear the inspiration in her music and we are completely here for this sound.\n\nIzzy is here with her new release ‘Hang Around’ and you’re going to want to ‘Hang Around’ and listen to this one! We hope you laughed at that. You can stream ‘Hang Around’ here, right now!\n\n“More than just “dreaming of the summer,” ‘Hang Around’ is a song that dares to reimagine what your life could be like and what you are able to achieve. My hopes are that this song can make whoever is listening feel uplifted and excited about their lives and that the chorus will be stuck in their heads after listening to it one time.”\n\nIzzy Mahoubi on ‘Hang Around’\n\n‘Hang Around’ was released on October 21 and is quickly becoming a The Honey POP fav! The big news is this incredible song is now accompanied by a music video too! We see Izzy and her friends take a trip into the woods, and both the video and Izzy’s voice have an infectious playfulness to them. We just can’t get enough … like actually, we’ve watched this almost a dozen times already and won’t be stopping anytime soon.\n\nIzzy has been performing since the age of 12 and you can truly tell how well versed this artist is. If there’s a way to get an invite to the next trip, our inbox is open! We’re so excited to bring you the exclusive premiere of the ‘Hang Around’ music video below!\n\nP.S, Izzy if you see this we would love the link to that sweater you’re wearing …. honestly a link to any of those outfits would be great, thanks in advance!\n\nBrb, currently organizing a group THP trip into the woods if you want to come? Let us know over on our Twitter @TheHoneyPOP. We’re also on Instagram and Facebook!\n\nFor more music recs, click here!"
