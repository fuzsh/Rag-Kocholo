Styles Ain&#39;t Raw (feat. Apathy &amp; Chino XL)\n15. Where I Are\n16. Time Travels On (feat. Majik Most &amp; Dutchmassive)\n\nNineteen Ninety Now is finally here and a hip-hop renaissance is about to begin! The art form is brought full-circle through this groundbreaking collaboration between underground giant Celph Titled and production legend Buckwild (D.I.T.C.)! Showing that the lessons from the past can be combined with the innovations of the present, these two heavyweight artists have joined forces to create a neo-classic. By having uninhibited access to Buckwild’s original mid-90’s production, Celph Titled was able to select and record to over 16 unreleased D.I.T.C. bangers; bringing his charismatic flow and lyrical prowess to each one. \r\n\r\nGuest appearances from D.I.T.C. (A.G., O.C., Diamond D), Treach (of Naughty by Nature), Vinnie Paz (of Jedi Mind Tricks), Brand Nubian (Grand Puba, Sadat X), R.A. The Rugged Man, Chino XL, Demigodz (Apathy, Ryu, Esoteric), F.T. (of Street Smartz) and more.\r\n\r\nKey Selling Points:\r\n\r\n• Long awaited debut album from Celph Titled\r\n\r\n• Multi-platinum producer Buckwild from the legendary Diggin’ In The Crates crew (D.I.T.C.) has produced countless classics over the last two decades for artists ranging from Artifacts, Organized Konfusion, and Mic Geronimo to The Notorious B.I.G., 50 Cent, and Jay-Z.\r\n\r\n• The beats on this album were originally produced by Buckwild between 1994 and 1995, but were never recorded to. The classic hip-hop sound of the SP-1200 and Akai-S950 is revisited on this project.\r\n\r\n• All scratches on this album are done by Mista Sinista of X-ecutioners fame.",
