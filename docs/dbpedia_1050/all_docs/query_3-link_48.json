        "text": "A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past; and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.\n\n[Closer again] We keep records of every stage--dozens of gramophone disks and photographs--\n\n\"Why, you were doin' a music-hall turn of imitations all the way--more like a runaway gramophone than a man.\"\n\nThey handled a line of cheap gramophones, and did a little with musical boxes.\n\nIt's like this, you see--I sell gramophones. Naturally I got to make 'em talk and tootle a bit to show 'em orf.\n\nThe Alhamra Reference Library is consisting of rare audio, video, gramophone, scripts and classical music collections and exhibitions to street cards.\n\nThe library consists of rare audio, video, gramophone, scripts and classical music collections and invitation cards of visual art exhibitions held in 40s and 50s.\n\nThe Library has rare audio/video tapes, gramophone, scripts and classical music collections.\n\n1929: Building is bought by the Gramophone Company and converted into recording studios.\n\nTo recover some stolen supplies, a couple of the supervisors at the American-owned Oriental Consolidated Mining Company (OCMC) took an old gramophone and had an interpreter record a message in Korean that an evil spirit would haunt the graves of the ancestors of the men who had stolen supplies from the mine.\n\nEarly phonographs and gramophones can make a lot more - like the HMV table-top horn gramophone that sold in 1995 for over [euro]14,000."
