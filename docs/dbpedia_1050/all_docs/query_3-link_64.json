        "text": "Brief history first...\n\nIn 1877, Thomas Edison invented a device called 'phonograph', a mechanical device used for recording and reproduction (playback) of sound. It recorded and played sound back off a cylinder. (ref. Wiki - File:EdisonPhonograph)\n\nIn 1887, Emile Berliner designed and patented 'gramophone' which recorded into groove on flat disc and played back sound by reading off the groove.\n\nIn 1895, first commercial record player was released. (ref. Reverb)\n\nThe turntable was created somewhere in the early 1900's. It functioned with the use of a cartridge which is composed of a pick-up (types include magnetic, dynamic, piezoelectric and capacitance) and needle. The needle or the styli were commonly made of Osium, Sapphire or Diamond. (ref. TurntableHistory)\n\nThen what is the difference? Turntable vs. Record Player\n\nRecord Player Is a record sound reproduction system with a turntable, an amplifier and speakers integrated as one unit.\n\nStandard Play (SP) Record is commonly known as '78'. This flat disc record was common between about 1898 and the late 1950s. Playing speed was around 78 RPM. (ref. yale.edu historyof78rpms)\n\nExtended Play (EP) Record is commonly known as 45 RPM midsize vinyl record. It is usually associated with 'single' music release. (ref: Wiki Extended_play)."
