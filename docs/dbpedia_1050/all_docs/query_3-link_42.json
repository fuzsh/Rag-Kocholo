This molded hard resin record (with abrasive mineral) allows up to 4 minutes music (one-side only) and will last a lifetime if used properly. We recommend changing the steel needle (soft or medium tone) every 2 plays as is normally suggested.\n\nCustom printing of 10\" tan paper record sleeves is available using dark color solid line artwork. Sleeves are available with hole or no hole."
