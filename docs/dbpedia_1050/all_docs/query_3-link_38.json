        "text": "How do you get sound from a plastic disc?\n\nThe other day, on a whim, I bought an inexpensive record player. Not an antique, but a generic late 1970s device. Black faux wood, with a warped and cracked plastic lid. Along with the player, I bought a cheap set of powered speakers and an old record to test out the machine. A 1979 Richard Clayderman album. He might not be an everyday name now, but in the 1970s and 80s, he was a piano playing sensation, providing covers for both classical tunes and songs of his time and recording the much-loved and well-known Ballade Pour Adeline.\n\nI placed the record on the turntable, cued up the arm, and hit the button to drop the needle down onto the disc. The speakers popped and hissed with that familiar buzz I associate with records. The sound rolled out of the speakers. Rich, warm and oddly comforting. Wave forms frozen in time. Not in digital 1s and 0s, like with compact discs, cassette tapes or digital files on a computer, but in analogue physical grooves etched into the actual surface of a record.\n\nIt’s an ingenious system when you think about it. A cylinder, scroll, or disc made of a (mostly) durable material, is etched with a vibrating point. The etching tool is literally vibrating with the incoming sound wave, translated through a sequence of mechanical and/or electromagnetic modules.\n\nAfter all, that’s what sound is; a series of waves. Pressure sequences rippling through the air from producer to receiver. A record engraver translates these sounds into an analogue series of frozen waves in the recording medium. Granted, there’s a few more steps involved to mastering a vinyl record well, but that’s the gist of it.\n\nTo play a recording, a stylus is lowered onto the medium. The most popular version is the vinyl disc we know as records. A turntable rotates the disc, dragging the needle along the series of grooves. The microscopic and rapid movements of the needle, tracing out the grooves, translated through a series of amplifiers back into sound.\n\nIt’s incredible.\n\nThere’s something special about record players. They’re an interesting step on the road towards the musical extravaganza we experience today. Records are the first moment in ten thousand years or so of our modern human history, that a human voice, or the musical output of an instrument, could be frozen in time and replayed at a later date.\n\nI think there’s something momentous about that. And also something interesting about how a record player stores and replays information. They’re a style of technology that may be worth preserving. Even as more modern, and more superior, formats and sound devices constantly come into view.\n\nBut, hiding in the undertones of this story; there is a toxic secret. The original formation, preservation and continued use of records carries in it a darker implication. A sting in the tale that asks fundamental questions about how we make the things we use.\n\nTo make sense of the strange joy, and peril, of records, we’ve got to reverse the turntable, making a brief trace, like a record needle moving along the groove, through the developmental history of the record player.\n\nPlace the disc, drop the needle, turn up the volume and join me.\n\nBrief history of the phonograph, gramophone, record player, and other associated devices\n\nÉdouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, in 1857, with his self-titled phonautograph, was the first person to describe a viable mechanism where sound could be transferred to a more permanent medium. It seems commonplace now, but think about it for a moment.\n\nAs long as humans in their modern form have been alive, sound could be translated into words, or musical notes. Both are encoded formats. They represent the sounds, but aren’t the sounds themselves. Words or musical notations needed other humans, or musical instruments, to reproduce the sounds. All sounds arose and died in the moment they were uttered; alive only in the listener's memory. Reproductions from words or other notations are reconstructions. It isn’t the sound itself.\n\nNot that writers, dreamers and other idea-innovators hadn’t imagined that sound could be replayed. A brief explanation by the United States National Park Service, at the Thomas Edison memorial laboratory, describes how an 1847 Parisian theatre critic imagined sound could be captured like the earliest photographs were capturing images.\n\n“Just as light captures images on a polished plate, we will soon preserve the sonic undulations of an air by Mario, a tirade of Miss Rachel, or a couplet by Frederick Lemaitre. We will hang on the wall the serenade of Don Pasquale, the imprecations of Amille, Ruy Blas's declarations of love—each daguerreotyped one evening when the artist was in high spirits.” (U.S. National Park Service, 2024)\n\nThe National Park Service notes that writers like Cyrano de Bergerac in the 17th century imagined ‘clockwork books that spoke to their readers.’ Either reference shows at least an imaginary version of sound recording some time before the invention of the record player.\n\nBut Martinville was not a dreamer like de Bergerac. Martinville was a practical tinkerer, and he created a device that followed his early understanding of the anatomy of the ear.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell had founded the Volta Laboratory in 1880 and with Chichester Bell (a cousin) and Charles Tainter, they innovated from a foil-wrapped cylinder to a wax impressed cardboard tube. Renamed the Graphophone, to be produced by the Volta Graphophone Company, they were off to a start. Edison returned to the idea, developed an improved model and called it the phonograph. Various patent wars between the competing models ensued.\n\nIronically, in 1877, just before Edison announced his original tinfoil based device, Charles Cros, a French writer and inventor, described a way that sound could be etched onto a disc for later translation onto a metal plate for reproduction. A description of the process, from a letter given to the Paris Academy of Sciences, is startling in its perspicuity; a vision of the future.\n\n“PROCESS OF RECORDING AND OF REPRODUCING AUDIBLE PHENOMENA…In general, my process consists in obtaining the tracing of the to-and-fro movements of a vibrating membrane, and the utilization of this tracing for reproducing the same to-and-fro movement, with their relative inherent durations and intensities in the same membrane, or in another adapted for furnishing the sounds and noises which result from this series of movements […]\n\nA light stylus is connected with the centre of a vibrating membrane; it terminates in a point (metallic wire, the barb of a feather, etc.), which bears upon a surface blackened by a flame. This surface is a part of a disc to which is given a double movement of rotation and rectilinear progression […]\n\nIf the membrane is at rest, the point will trace a simple spiral; if the membrane vibrates, the traced spiral will be undulating, and these undulations represent exactly all the to-and-fro movements of the membrane, with their times and intensities.\" (Edmunds, 1888)\n\nNaming the device the ‘Paleophone,’ Cros didn’t make or show any prototypes, so his thoughts remained stuck in the archives of the\n\nIt was Emile Berliner, a German-American inventor, in 1887, who brought the record player into the form we know it today. Instead of cylinders, Berliner experimented with various types of disc with grooves inscribed on the surface.\n\nA needle hanging off the end of a ‘tonearm’ picked up the vibrations, translating the motion through a lever or coil, which turned movement to analogue electrical signals. The signal was passed through early circuitry to make music. Discs were made of plastic, using pressure-plate pressing against a metal master. Coined the ‘Gramophone,’ One of Berliner’s early patents shows all these elements in play.\n\nOther improvements followed, longer playing records (LPs) with a rotation speed (33 1/3 rotations per minute) that allowed nearly half an hour of playtime, each side of the record. First generation of records were mono-channel, with only the side-to-side vibration. Technical improvements allowed multi-channel grooving, which reintroduced to up-and-down cutting along with the side-to-side etch. This allowed stereo sound (two channels) out of a single record groove. The record player I found might have a few other improvements, but it is essentially the same machine.\n\nGiven the decades that have passed since practical and affordable record players have come and gone, a debate often arises from within the pro-Vinyl culture, ‘Are vinyl records actually better audio than their modern counterparts?’\n\nThe answer is complicated.\n\nThe distracting argument between the sound qualities of records and other media\n\nIf a vinyl record is essentially a ‘trapped’ sound wave, you might think that a compact disc, or digital file, as follow-on sound recording technologies, would work in the same fashion. But they don’t. In fact, sound technologies made a crucial jump, moving away from the analogue style recording, sound frozen in actual waves in the recording medium (the record). Instead, sound became digital, stored as a series of 1s and 0s, on or off states.\n\nFor reference, cassettes, that interleaving tape-based format between records and compact discs, were mostly an analogue technology, recording the sound in the continuous rising and falling wave forms.\n\nTo convert the continuous sound wave via a microphone, a digital audio converter takes a series of rapid snapshots of the sound wave.\n\nA digital recording device takes many snapshots. The resolution of digital audio files are usually measured, not in the hundreds, but in the tens-of-thousands. For example, a digital recording might sample sound at 44,000 hertz (cycles per second). Each of these snapshots is translated into a series of discrete high and low values, the 1s and 0s of the digital world.\n\nFor compact disc (CD), these 1s and 0s are burned into the surface of a plastic and dye-coated disc; creating a series of pits.\n\nThese microscopic pits are read by a laser, which translates the high and low values back through a Digital Audio Converter (DAC). This ‘fills in’ the missing pieces between the original samples, creating the fully fledged sound wave.\n\nOn the surface, you might think a record is better. After all, it’s the actual sound wave. Right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nDylan Matthews, writing for Vox with an article, “Vinyl's great, but it's not better than CDs,” notes that vinyl, despite the impression of being a ‘pure’ capture of sound, went through its own mastering process.\n\n“Vinyl is physically limited by the fact that records have to be capable of being played without skipping or causing distortion … If notes get too low in pitch, that means less audio can fit in a given amount of vinyl. If notes are too high, the stylus has difficulty tracking them, causing distortion. So engineers mastering for vinyl often cut back on extreme high or low ends, using a variety of methods, all of which alter the music.” (Matthews, Vox, 2014)\n\nPut another way, stuff got lost along the way. Many records were made with less effective recording equipment. The logic follows, what goes onto a disc, is only as good as the microphone that captures the sound wave and all the translation systems on the way.\n\nWhat comes off the record, is only as good as the player and speakers that play it. Add to this, the ever-present distortion on all but the best record equipment; the pops, hisses and crackles of the sapphire needle whipping down the grove.\n\nBut that isn’t the characteristic that people most point out with records. If they comment on anything, it’s there characteristically warm sound.\n\nThe few records I’ve found so far, ranging across about a thirty year pressing window, all do sound warm. If mastering techniques had to cut much of the bass and re-introduce it within the stereo, then it makes sense why this is the case.\n\nIn contrast, a modern compact disc, or equivalent high-quality digital file, may be better sampled than a record. Matthews, in his review of vinyl sound quality, “Vinyl's great, but it's not better than CDs,” notes:\n\n“The sampling rate for CDs is 44.1kHz, meaning that CD recordings sample the master recording 44,100 times a second, and can capture frequencies as high as 20 kHz. That is about the limit of what humans can hear; at least one experiment has confirmed that listeners in blind tests can't tell the difference between recordings that include frequencies above 21k and ones that don't. You may think you can hear more than CDs are giving you. But you probably can’t.” (Matthews, Vox, 2014)\n\nIt’s a controversial suggestion. That modern audio, with respect to record aficionados, probably sounds better. But I wonder if the argument itself is misguided. Records might not sound better, it sounds different.\n\nThat’s the point.\n\nIt not only sounds different, but it feels different to use.\n\nAnd there’s something else to, that doesn’t seem to get mentioned; a technological longevity that is incredibly attractive as we struggle through a growing tsunami of technowaste. Though vinyl isn’t without its waste drawbacks, something I’ll get back to.\n\nA tactile experience has its own special quality\n\nI’ve already said the second-hand store record player I bought is not a high quality device. It was probably a cheap item, even when it was new. I don’t have a pre-amplifier in between the record player and the speakers. They’re powered, but probably not enough to magnify the sound effectively. So all records play quietly. I call it ambience. The needle is old and seems mis-aligned.\n\nBut it works.\n\nDecades after it was built and many decades after the records were pressed. I have recordings I’ve never heard of, some that don’t seem to exist anywhere else.\n\nThat’s just the thing.\n\nIt works.\n\nThat tactility of taking out the record, wiping it clean, laying it on the turntable and setting the needle to drop. The hiss and pop and the sound blooming from the speakers. There're no codecs, software updates or complex electronics to make it work. It just goes. Sitting there, watching the turntable spin, it feels like I can almost see the sound being produced, though the tip of the needle is hidden with the groove and the machine’s parts are hidden inside its box.\n\nIt s like the feeling I get when I watch a music box, those strange little Victorian devices that play music by ‘picking’ at a fixed metal comb using a drum covered in spikes. Their music is very poor, simple tinny tones. They can’t reproduce a human voice, but if maintained, they will last for centuries.\n\nDavid Sax, in Revenge of the Analogue, spoke fondly of the durable and interesting physicality of many of the analogue things we’ve created: books, vinyl records and board-games. He suggested analogue things would remain a part of our technoculture for longer than anticipated; rather than being one step in a technological evolution that was inevitably bypassed by newer technologies.\n\nI agree. People have begun to re-invest in record players. Artists like Taylor Swift release special vinyl editions and even cassette tapes of their songs or albums. She isn’t the only one to have communicated via record.\n\nIn 1977, NASA, under the guidance of astronomer and famed science communicator Carl Sagan, included a special recording with the Voyager spacecraft.\n\nDo you know what they used?\n\nA record, pinned to the side of each spacecraft; along with a record needle. The ‘Golden Record’ contained voices from across the globe, wishing some future recipient hello from Earth in their own language. Dozens of songs, including Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode.”\n\nThe record also contains, in analogue form, a teasingly scant few images showing humanity, Earth and some of our technology. A brief microcosm of humanity, frozen in a waveform and sent to the stars. I love the thought of those two records on Voyager I and II, drifting out among the stars for uncountable eons.\n\nThere is a dangerous trend in ever reducing temporal cycles of technology. Technology that comes and goes not in centuries or decades, but in a few handfuls of years.\n\nSo long as they are cared for, records can last for a while. The compact disc, far less than that, it seems. With each jump, the technologies in play seem to be more brittle. More complicated, harder to maintain and dependent on a more vast infrastructure to support them.\n\nI might love my digital audio files, purchased at the click of a button. But I’m consciousness that they can vanish in a heart-beat. Maybe because the company that sold them to me (Apple) may decide that there is a licensing conflict and I can’t keep the music I bought. Or, the digital files can’t be played because I didn’t upgrade them to a new format. Or they suffered bit rot on my drive or in the great server-in-the-sky. Or I don’t have the right software. Compact discs are no better. I still have a bunch of them, but less and less access to the technologies that play them.\n\nRecord players, by working with simpler mechanical and electromagnetic techniques, seem to have resisted obsolescence. And I can’t help but salute any technology that does that.\n\nBut here comes the twist; a reminder that every technology choice we make has implications.\n\nVinyl records, as indicated by the ‘vinyl’ in their name, are sourced from Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), one of the mostly highly produced and toxic plastics on Earth. Metal additives, like lead or cadmium, both toxic, may lead to additional health impact.\n\nAll these ingredients had and still possibly have health effects for anyone involved in the production of records. On the disposal end, when broken burned or recycled, PVC releases terrible by-products, so it isn’t really recyclable with current technology. It also isn’t clear if the materials within old records pose long-term health risks for those playing them. Are modern pressings are any better? Given they still seem to use vinyl, I don’t see how they could be.\n\nThat’s the strange twist with a technology like vinyl records. They provide sound with wonderful characteristics, and they may be playable long after other sound technologies are defunct. But they are also terrible for the environment and possibly our long-term health. It’s a dark undertone to something that seems to so interesting.\n\nI think vinyl records offer a parable to the technology choices of today. Like the currently-rabidly-popular technology of Generative AI. On the surface, it might offer a host of benefits; easy of creating images and text, low barrier to use and profligacy. It might even build up a cult-like following. But as another in our long series of technology choices, it has consequences.\n\nBuilt and used incorrectly, Generative AI is a power-intensive, propaganda distributing, biased, garbage content generation system-of-systems. It could leave a toxic legacy that lasts generations. But designed and used correctly, it could dig into the backlog of uncategorised and unstructured data, help identify diseases and enrich our knowledge.\n\nThe same questions apply to records, could they be designed differently? They have some excellent characteristics: longevity, simple playing machinery, unique sound and tactile, embodied interaction. If the materials are the problem, could records be made out of better materials? Granted, new materials would require new technology choices, perhaps with their own compromises. I don’t know if anything comes for free, but that shouldn’t stop us from trying to make the best choices possible.\n\nAssuming we could make a record that was safer to produce, I have visions of future archaeologists finding an ecologically sensitive and durable record, somehow preserved in a drawer somewhere. Looking through a microscope and somehow figuring out how to stitch together a needle, arm and electromagnetic kit to amplify the analogue wave.\n\nImagine that.\n\nThe wonderful click, pop and buzz and warm sounds streaming out its sounds through the ages.\n\nReferences\n\nBerliner, E.
