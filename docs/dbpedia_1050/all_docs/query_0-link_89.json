We Know What We Like We Like What We Know 24 SEPTEMBER 2004 ISSUE #57 <strong>Record</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Week</strong> Perspective EMI Kevin Mark Trail We’ve been lucky enough to have seen Kevin and his band perform three times recently and we’re convinced that he has some hit tunes comin’ at ya! At <strong>the</strong> EMI conference, he had <strong>the</strong> pleasure <strong>of</strong> opening proceedings with <strong>the</strong> track D Thames, which will be <strong>the</strong> likely follow up to Perspective. Needless to say, KMT was one <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> highlights <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> live performances we witnessed throughout <strong>the</strong> day. A big future awaits this very personable young man... www.hitsheet.co.uk"
