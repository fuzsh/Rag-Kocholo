The leading litrhts of today's reissue business — the people charged with compilint; the elaborate, often com- prehensive CD packages recounting the history of 20th-centuiy jazz — came to the game with a variety of backgrounds.

JoeKen Sommer, Adam White Director of Research: Michael Elhs Tie Sunmer Heat Of Doyle Bramhall II & Smokestack Step acro.ss the Welcome mat and prepare for swampy, high-fever Texas blues rock— with a smoldering, erotic undercurrent. In one of the be.st club concerts this colum- nist has witnessed this year, Doyle Bramhall II & Smoke- stack cast an unbreakable spell over several hundred per- spiring spectators on the night of June 20 at the Village Underground on West Third Street in New York's Green- wich Village. As the band roared into \"So You Want It to Rain\" from its new We/come album (RCA), the music utter- ly possessed the room, making the band feel \"We've got a place to go/A place to call our own\" in a mutual bond that encompassed the entire college-age audience. Bramhall's wife, co-writer, and backing vocalist, Susannah Melvoin, thinks she knows why. \"That song has a sensualness to it, like the damp air in a hot cabin, and Doyle's music has that quality overall,\" Melvoin says with a bashful laugh. \"In the lyric, I tried to write about a moment, a feeling as a little girl of 'Where do you want to be right now — if you could be anywhere?' and the answer would be in the rain, a perfect rain. We wanted an atmosphere, deeply romantic but simple, and so it's a love song, too.\" And like virtually all of Welcome, it's near-torrid in its ardent intensity. Smokestack, Bramhall's band, is a compact, strong-willed squad with a fastidious sense of phrasing and tone but a dramatic elasticity in the structure of its songs and sets. Bassist Chris Bruce and drummer J.J. Johnson pace the music with elongated te.xtures that snap back into form with startling precision. Sec- ond guitarist Craig Ross also shines as a guest asset onstage and on record. Mean- while, Melvoin's voice rides under and between the rhythms and the emotional dic- tion of Doyle's left-handed '64 sunburst Strat as if it were an exhortatory horn section. Pouring out of '67 Marshall Plexy SuperBass amps, the music is muscular but deliri- ously lithe in its hungry .sexuality, and it builds to a hoof- pounding charge like a bull in heat. Gloriously aroused rock like \"Soul Shaker\" seldom makes it onto recordings with the nostril-flaring gusto heard on Welcome. And on the cut named for the group, the com- bustible \"Smokestack,\" you get a furnace's worth of shifting warmth and stinging fumes. \" 'Smokestack' was written in band rehearsal with a chorus idea I had for a couple of years that I never did anything with, and it just fit perfectly,\" Bramhall says. \"The reason the songs sound so much dif- ferent on this album than the other records [Doyle Bramhall II (Geffen, 1996), Jellycream (RCA, 1999)] is because we recorded it live — all the vocals, guitar solos, everything. In order to do that, we went in for seven weeks to rehearse every day with the help of [Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers'l Benmont Tench | co-producer of Welcome with Jim Scott and Bramhall]. He arranged a lot of the songs with us. He's a genius and helped get the songs as tight as we could possibly get them, so then we could exper- iment and be spontaneous in the moment.\" Thus, the band members achieved a well-accustomed comfort zone with the new material before they took it on the road, helping ensure the piping-hot peak of the Vil- lage Underground show with the explosive live rendition of \"Green Light Girl,\" another Welcome track (and its ini- tial single). Co-authored by Bramhall and Melvoin, the song is about a wishfully wanton young woman on the prowl: \"Too hot to handle now/Spend all night/In a red light town/Looking for a green light.\" \" 'Green Light' was a song I came up with the music for in about five minutes,\" Bramhall says, \"and I didn't have a tape recorder, so I called my own cell phone mail and .sang the parts on it — the vocal melody, the guitar lick in the front. I called back when I got home to Studio City in Los Angeles, where I've lived for six years, and I notat- ed it and took it to band rehearsal. We played it out once, and that's how- it sounded.\" Besides plying his sound on additional club dates, Bram- hall II & Smokestack will be touring arenas through August with Eric Clapton, who sought out Bramhall after hearing his Jellycream release and invited him to appear on Clapton's 2000 Riding With the King collaboration with B.B. King (the blues legends cutting two Bramhall songs in the process), as well as Clapton's new Heptile record (for which Bramhall and Melvoin co-WTote \"Superman Inside\" with Clapton). Come autumn, Bramhall and band will pursue their own circuit of shows, a prospect he looks forward to, particu- larly since his wife and newborn child can be along for the ride. \"We got married on Aug. 16, 1997,\" he says of Mel- voin, \"and we have a 2-month-old girl, India Willah Bramhall — that's after [Nebraska-bred novelist] Willa Gather. I'm reading 0 Pioneers! right now.\" Like the themes of the pastoral novelist Bramhall and his wife admire, his own story contains considerable struggle on the fringes of America's Western ranching and farming region. Bom Dec. 24, 1968, at Baylor University Hospital in Dallas, Bramhall is the son of gifted guitarist/songwriter/pro- ducer Doyle Bramhall and accountant Linda (n^e Clifford). He has a younger sister, Georgia (\"after the Ray Charles song\"), by his since-divorced parents, and three step-siblings. Until age .5, Doyle lived in a \"communal house\" in Austin, Texas, with his family as well as Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan. \"Jimmie was at my birth in the hospital,\" Bramhall recalls with a fond chuckle, \"and Stevie called me his little brother. Later, I got hired in Jim- mie's band, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, on Stevie's recommendation, because I'd been sit- ting in with Stevie since I was 14 orI5. Jimmie was looking for a guitar player after he record- ed [the Thunderbirds' 1989 album] Powerful Stuff, so Stevie said. 'Definitely get Doyle — he's the new shit!' \" Reared on rock and blues ranging from Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone to Albert King, the left- handed Bramhall started out playing a right- handed guitar but now relies on his lefty Strat \"with the strings upside down, like Otis Rush.\" After his late-teens stint with the Thunder- birds, Doyle fronted the Arc Angels beside cohort Charlie Sexton, a learning experience in every sense. \"Charlie and myself, we grew up around serious alcoholics and drug addicts,\" Bramhall says, \"and the way w e dealt with it was the complete opposite of one another. He didn't want to touch it because he saw what it did to his fam- ily, but I was the kind of person who went right for it because I thought it was cool and bad-assed to be a tough drinker and drug addict, too. From my experience, I think it is hereditary, and I think it does get worse every genera- tion, especially alcoholism, if you just let it go. I think the 'X' gene is always there, but there are things you can do to combat it. Luckily for me, I've done so much to get a grasp on it. I work constantly on my personal life and go to ther- apy and A.A. [Alcoholics Anonymous]. The more work I do personally on myself, the better my music sounds, the more focused I am as an artist, and the clearer I see myself.\" Bramhall explains that melancholy songs on Welcome, like \"Life,\" are derived from seeing \"a lot of people go down because of drug addiction, like Susannah's brother [Jonathan Melvoin], who was in Smashing Pumpkins and had recently died [of a heroin overdose in 1996 at age 34].\" Bramhall notes that he was newly sober in '96 when he met his future wife, who was summoned to sing backup on his Geffen album by her si.ster Wendy Melvoin, a former mem- ber of Prince's the Revolution band and co-producer of Bramhall's solo debut with Lisa Coleman (her partner in the Revolution and in Wendy and Lisa). Susannah had been a vocalist with the Family, a quintet whose eponymous 1985 album appeared on Prince's Paisley Park label. She also sang on Prince's Around the World in a Day (198.T) and Parade (1986) albums, after which she became a backing vocalist for Quincy Jones. \"Wendy thought Susannah would be great for my record,\" Bramhall relates with a laugh, \"but that turned into a secret love affair, which blossomed into a beautiful marriage. I was really shy at first and avoided eye contact, and after record- ing sessions, we would just watch a lot of Mystery Science Theater 2000 together— but that didn't last long!\" Looking back on his recent history in a Manhattan hotel room with his wife and baby, Bramhall seems humble and grateful but not at all dazed by the distance he's covered in the past five years — because it's been damn hard work. And he believes the best is yet to be. \"When I first met Eric after he'd heard the Jellycream record,\" Bramhall recounts, \"he said, 'Why aren't you well- known?' 1 talked with him about my own experiences per- sonally and in the business, and he's obviously a good per- son to bounce it off of, because he'd gone through hard times and is still at the top of his game.\" What advice did Clapton offer? \"Basically,\" Bramhall confides, \"he told me not to get discouraged. 'You are the one who knows what you need to do,' he said. 'You need to follow your heart, and every- body else will get on board.' Because of the way he said it, I got it, you know? So I've just been doing it.\" BILLBOARD JULY 7. 2001 www.billboard.com 3 No. 1 IN BILLBOARD 2 VOLUME 1 1 3 ■ NO. 27 w THIS WEEK THIS WEEK THIS WEEK Billboard ^^'^ ^^^^ ^^'^ ^^^^ ^^'^ ^^^^ > THE BILLBOARD 200 • * DEVIL SNIGKT • 0-12 • SHAIW CLASSICAL * VEROI > ANDREA BOCELU ■ miuPS CLASSICAL CROSSOVER * THE VOICE • RUSSEIL WATSON • DECCA coumnY * O BUOTHER, WHERE ARE THOU? • SOONDTRACK • MEKIJWY HEATSEEKERS * SWORDFISH THE ^LBUM fSOUNDTRACKJ FWJL OAKEIVif OU3 • *A?'si£B StWSFT ffwb INDEPENDENT * PUT VO HOOD UP • Ut.

Memorial Pays Tribute To Jazz Vet Simon BY JILL PESSELNiCK Bebop singer Helen Merrill, jazz pianist Dick Katz, and pianist/com- poser Dr. Billy Taylor were among the performer.s who paid tribute to George T. Simon — ^jazz writer, musi- cian, producer, and a former executive director of the New York chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) — at a June 14 memorial at New York's St. Peter's Lutheran Church. The service also included speeches by NARAS president/CEO Michael Greene, trumpeter Richard Sudhalter, and producer George Avakian. Appro.\\imately 125 members of the New York music community attended in honor of Simon, who died Feb. 13 at New York University Medical Center at the age of 88. He passed away from pneumonia following a battle with Parkinson's disease. At the memorial, Taylor spoke about Simon and performed a piece called \"A Bientot.\" It was a work that Simon particularly liked, Taylor recalls. \"When NARAS was organized, we were among the five founding mem- bers of the New York [chapter],\" Taylor says. \"He devoted the rest of his working life to that. George's job as executive director [from 1958 to 1976 and later as a con- siMON sultant] was to keep things moving and make people aware about the ideals that the organization had. In my opin- ion, NARAS would not have gone in some of the directions that it did go in had he not been there to beg and cajole and put people back at the table when they stoi-med out. He made a lot of things happen, because he had respect from people.\" Simon began his music industry career in 1935 as associate editor of the music magazine Metronome. In 1939, Simon became editor in chief, a position he held until 1955. Simon played drums on the first recordings of the Glenn Miller Band in 1937 and wrote lyrics for Duke Ellington and Alec Wilder, under the pseudonym Buck Pincus. During World War II, he was a member of Miller's Army Air Forces Band. Simon, who wrote several books about .swing, later acted as a supervi- sor at the record company Jazztone and as president of the record production company Bouree Productions from 1958 to 1960. In 1977, he won a Grammy Award for his liner notes to Bhig Cms- by: A Legendary Performer (RCA). He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Beverly; a daughter: a son; and three grandchildren. 4 www.blllboard.com BILLBOARO JULY 7, 2001 DR.

BEGINNING NEXT WEEK, Hlliil HIT AFTER HIT AFTER HIT WILL EXPLODE II.S. May Ignore WTO Move To Void Controversial Act Uniiiceiy Tasini Ruiing Could Affect Industry BY BILL HOLLAND WASHINGTON, D.C.— Con- gress will most likely ignore a World Trade Organization (WTO) demand to void the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, according to sources on Capitol Hill. The law allows bars, taverns, and retail shops to use background music without paying music licensing fees to U.S. performing rights societies. The U.S. has until July 27 to respond to the WTO's request for action. Ac- cording to .spokes- persons on Capitol Hill, law- makers have not planned any hearings on the matter. A spokesman at the office of the U.S. Trade Representative would not comment on how, or if, the administration's trade body will deal with the <lemand. fii-st brought to its attention in .January 1999. \"You expect me to tell you now what we might do a month from now?\" aske<l spokesman Rich Mills. If the U.S. turns its back on the WTO — of which it is a member — the international group is likely to ask for compensation from the U.S. in another area of trade. If arbitration fails, the WTO may impose trade sanctions. Such sanctions could include withhold- ing U.S. music-royalty income or even an embargo or restrictions on other products. WORLD TKADE Organization \" The situation arose in reaction to legislation crafted by Rep. H. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., now head of the House Judiciary Com- mittee. Initially responding to bar and tavern constituents — who com- plained of heavy-handed tactics by local ASCAP officials who threat- ened lawsuits if they didn't comply with licensing — Sensenbrenner introduced the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, which gave such businesses a no- fee exemption. ASCAP and BMI both op- posed the meas- ure, but after Sensenbrenner held up all copy- right legislation in Congress for two years — including the Copy- right Term Extension Act, which performing rights groups fav- ored — the rights societies with- drew their opposition. Both bills became law in 1998. U.S. collecting societies said they would lose millions of dollars in royalty income because of the exemption, and European societies predicted losses of between $3.8 million and $6.8 million annually (BiZHMord, Jan. 6, 1999). The Irish Music Rights Society first complained that the U.S. law set a precedent for diminishing the existing rights of songwriters and composers, and it lodged a complaint with the WTO. Last July, the WTO panel sided with the complainants.

Zomba Opens New Uperation In Lisbon Lewis To Leave Cbrysaiis f lira Expansion Continues, Mew Office is To Boost Group In Portugai BY HENRIQUE AMOROSO and GORDON MASSON LISBON— The Zomba Records Group is entering the next phase of its European expansion program, with the July I opening of a detlicat- ed marketing office in Portugal. Over the pa.st 15 months, Zomba established .stand-alone com|)anies in France, Spain, and Italy to comple- ment existuig ojierations in the U.K., Germany, Aastria, Switzerland, Swe- den, and the Benelux tenitories. Based in Lisbon, Zomba's opera- tion in Portugal will be a division of Zomba Spain and will be overseen by Andrfes Ochaita, managing dii'ector of Zomba Spain. Odette Rothigues has been appointed Zomba's marketing manager in Portugal, while Raquel Fortes w ill be head of promotion. T6ze Brito, managing director of Universal Music Portugal, notes, \"Hie last of the independents is devel- oping a stratcg}' that, in the medium term, may [attnictj a sharp (exami- nation) by the majors. But this is a sign of market encouragement, which we obviously welcome.\" Stuart Watson, managing director of Zomba's International Records Group, says, \"This move mirrors the highly .succe.s.sful approach we have taken in Scandinavia, where we cre- ated dedicated marketing offices in Denmark and Nonvay as affiliates of Zomba Scandinavia. Handling our own marketing and promotion in Portugal will not affect our excel- lent relationship with Virgin/EMI, who will continue to sell and dis- tribute all Zomba repertoire in both Spain and Portugal.\" David Ferreira, managing director of EMI-Valentim dc Carvalho, Zomba's current distributor in Por- tugal, is receptive to the move. \"We're happy that such a dynamic company keeps choosing us as partners in the dis- tribution and sales area.\" WATSON Ochaita says, \"Having a Zomba presence in a country with such a musical richness and a strong local market will be a great asset. It also makes sense for this move to take place at the same time as our market entry in BraziL\" Teresa Lage, programming coordi- nator at Portuguese radio station RFM, says, \"We welcome the initia- tive, as it will be reflected in an improved awareness of our listeners.\" But Rui Borges, music manager at retailer FNAC in Lisbon, warns, \"The new people in charge should be careful, because it wouldn't be the first time we see similar operations become unfruitful as the large mar- keting budgets spent simply fail to meet the expected results.\" The first relea.se to be handled by Zomba's Portuguese marketing oper- ation will be Celebrity, the new album from 'N Sync, to be released July 23. Daniel dc Sousa, managing direc- tor of Warner Music Portugal, beUeves it will be \"a hard start-off task ahead of the new [Zomba] staffers, but a challenging one, too.\" Carlos Lacerda and Fernando Matias, joint managing directors at the Lisbon-based Ova(;ao label, are heart- ened by Zomba's confidence in the Por- tuguese market. \"Anything that can fi^eshen up the music market is very welcome,\" Lacenla says. Matias adds, \"There can never be too many good ideas nor too much professional talent\" Zomba has ah^ady achieved suc- cess in Portugal. Backstreet Boys' MUlenniiim and Black & Blue are both platinum (for sales of 40,000 units), while 'N Sync's No Strings Attached is silver ( 10,000 units). Brit- ney Spears' . . . Baby One Mnre Time is double-platinum in Portugal, while her follow-up, Oops! . . . I Did I Again, is near the same status. Recorded music shipments hit an all-time high in Portugal last year, according to labels' body AFP. Tbtal units shipped were 15.2 million, up 1.33% over 1999, with a value of 21.2 billion escudos ($98 million), up 6.33% over 1999 {Billboard. March 31). BY GORDON MASSON LONDON— Chrysalis Group is searching for a new CEO to head up its music division now that chief Steve Lewis has opted not to extend his contract. The move shocked Chry.salis insiders, who had no inkling that he planned to leave the company when his contract expires Wednesday (4). Lewis has overseen the group's music activities around the world since joining the company in Jan- uary 1993. During Lewis' tenure, Chrysalis Music Publishing estab- lished offices in Oslo, Copen- hagen, Munich, Paris, Nashville, and Barcelona, to join those al- ready in London, Los Angeles, and Stockholm. Lewis tells Billboard that he de- cided not to ink a new deal because he simply wants to take some time off. \"I'm not leaving because I'm in any way lanhappy or unsatisfied with what's happened at Chrysalis, and the last thing I want to do is leave them in any difficulty.\" Lewis adds that while he has been talking about possible successors with Chrysalis chairman Chris Wright, no final decisions have been made. \"I have every confidence that the companies in the music division will go fiwn strength to strength, be- cause they have outstanding management. Chris Wright is a great chairman and has given me every support, as I'm sure he will my successor.\" Wright tells Billboard, \"We weren't expecting Steve to be leav- ing, and obviously we just want to consider our options without neces- sarily moving too quickly. In the meantime, things are under capa- ble control with all the existing executives that are in place. I don't think there is any panic, and we'll consider things over the next cou- ple of months or so before making any final decisions.\" ^ Tiiken aback by the decision, Wright nevertheless has j^^^ nothing but praise y.^Bk for Lewis: \"Steve ^ has done a very good job. TTie music division has grown enormously in the Lfwis time he has been there. I was gen- uinely surprised that he wanted to move on. He's seen a lot of success with Chrysalis in the time that he's been here. Now there's a new chal- lenge there to take the music divi- sion further forward.\" That challenge will include fulfill- ing Lewis' vision of completing the company's global publishing net- work. \"I really regret that I wont be here when Chrysalis becomes a multinational, self-administered pub- ( Covtinued on page 67) 6 www.billboard.com BILLBOARD JULY 7. 2001 - * 4 ': 1st annual □wards Ihe #1 rated entertainment special in BET History!

The sale, which should close in the next few weeks, con- chjdes a process that began in late No- vember, when New York-based RMM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protec- tion. At the time, the label had estimated as.sets of $31.9 million and was facing liabilities of $12.73 million. Five months earlier, a federal judge in Puerto Rico ordered RMM to i>ay singer Glenn Monroig $7.7 million for illegally recording one of his songs. In May, RMM was gi*anted per- mission in U.S. Bankraptcy Court of the Southern District of New York to sell itself to the highest bid- der Universal, RMM's distributor, and Sony Discos, which has done distribution for RMM in the past, submitted offers. .A decision was reached on the basis of opinions by a court creditors committee and Mercado himself A Sony Discos spokeswoman did not have any comment at pre-ss time. RMM's music legacy includes recordings by the late Latin band- leader Tito ^^lente, who was a client of RMM Management, the arti.st- management and booking agency Mercado founded in 1972. Celia Cruz also recoixled for the label. RMM also launched the cai-eer of India, whose next album will be released by UMG, and is home to Ke™ Ceballos. The label's catalog comprises more than 400 titles and 130 artists — including Marc Antho- ny's Spanish-language albums, Todo A Sh Tiempo and Cojitra La Cor- riente, which will revert to Uni- versal when the current distribu- Universal sees the acquisition as a way to increase its industry profile in Latin music. tion agreement with Sony expu'es. Pointing to the distribution agreement recently struck with L'nivision Communications' new label, UMG presi- dent/COO Zach Horowitz says the RMM purchase is evidence of UMG's desire to build its Latin-music pres- ence further. \"We think the combina- tion of RMM and Rodven [the Ven- ezuelan record com- pany UMG pur- chased in 1995 for $55 million] really positions us as the leading home for tropical music.\" He adds that UMG will con- tinue to be \"very aggressive\" in teims of acqui.sitioas. For now, it remains uncleai- how exactly RMM will be integrated at UMG, or what will become of the RMM name. \"We know that the RMM name is a recognizable bi'and and is assodate<l with a certain kind of quality music,\" Hoi'owitz says. HOROWITZ \"The plan is to use it where appropriate to both further the bi'and and that kind of music.\" Also uncertain is what role there will be at UMG for Mereado, a prominent and sometimes con- troversial figure in the Latin- music scene. In a statement, Mercado said, \"I am e.\\dted that our family of RMM recording artists has found an appro- priate new home with Universal,\" adding, \"I look forward to a continu- ing role in the music industry.\" Mercado could not be reached for further comment. His daughter, Debra Mercado, RMM's national director of publicity, did not return calls by press time. The five-disc set has a minimum advertised price of $74.95. Other first-time catalog DVD titles for the month include MGM Home Entertainment's Fiddler on the Roof and The Terminator, both scheduled for Oct. 2. \"We're not anxious that it's a crowded month,\" says MGM executive VP of sales Robert Wittenberg. \"Consumers will buy more than one disc, and frankly, it works to our advantage.\" The number of high-profile catalog titles coming this Octo- ber is in marked contrast to October 2000, when the only significant catalog title re- leased was Buena Vista's Toy Story collector's set, which included Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and a bonus disc. The rest of the month was filled with new releases from that summer, including The Patriot. Shang- hai S'oon, Rules of Engage- ment, and U571. This year, the only new release on the October schedule is Univer- sal Studios Home Video's The Mummy Returns, slated for Oct. 2. \"So far, the release .schedule is better by leaps and bounds over last year because these epic titles just don't come along that often,\" says DVD Empire.com director of business develop- ment Erik Ross. \"I think Star Wars will be the hands down best seller for the season.\" To reach that status of top-sell- (Continued on jmge 7i) Don Romeo Rememliereil As Pioneer Talent Buyer Was The First To Book National Acts Into Festivals BY RAY WADDELL NASHVILLE— Described as an honorable man always ready «ith a story, pioneering fair and festival talent buyer Dominic (Don) Romeo dietl June Zi of liver and kidney fail- ure at the age of 76 at his home in Omaha, Neb. As a youth in Omaha, Romeo taught him.self to play guit;u' and won Xhe Arthur Godfrey Tident Seui-ch on TV in 1!M5 as jwit of the Metro Tones TVio, a musical comedy giDup. After a stint in the Korean War with the U.S. Army, Romeo returned to Omaha in 19.52 to work for the Paul Moorehead Agency. He pui'chased the agency two years later and fonne<l the Don Romeo Agency. \"He was a pioneer in the fail- basi- ness, but |)eople neetl to realize Don Romeo was really about show busi- ness, ijeriod,\" says Paul Moore, who heads up the fair division for the William Morris Agency in Nashville. \"He booke<l an many clubs, balhiMms, and other venues as he did fau-s. He booke<l Ak-Sai'-Ben Arena (in Omaha) for yea's, with act.-; ranging fixim Bob Hope and Red Skelton to the Fifth Dimension and Tony Bennett.\" Moore says Romeo and the late William Mollis agent Sidney E|)stein in Chicago were the first to book national talent into fairs. \"Don Romeo was one of the first customer Sidney talked into selling fail's name stars. Much nf what we know of the mo<l- eni-day f;m' industry as it relates to talent stalled with those ideas that Sidney and Don cune up with.\" As a fair booker, Romeo worked with acts I'anging from I ^assie and the Three Stooges to the Rolling Stones and nearly every country act that ever played fairs. Romeo retired in 1989 and .sold the company to Bob Romeo, his son. In IBSO, TBA En- bomeo tertainmcnt Co. acquired it a.s Romeo Entertainment Co. The younger Romeo now heads TBA's fairs and festivals division, based in Crescent, Iowa. \"He was my father, business part- ner, and mentor,\" Bob Romeo says. \"1 remember being on the bus with the Three Stooges and Dad when he had them at the fair in Imperial, Neb. As I look back, some of the best times I ever had were just sitting back with Dad and telling stories.\" As a talent buyer. Romeo was respected by both agents and artists. \"Mr. Romeo exemplified what's good about the music busi- ness, with honor, integrity, and by really caring about the people he worked with,\" performer Charlie Daniels says. \"He sm-e will be missed.\" Country singer John Anderson recalls the professionalism of Romeo and his organization. \"He was one of the premier talent buyers in countrj' mu.sic for many, many years. Every Romeo show I ever worked was fii'st- class, and we never had to worry about our money — which is .saying sometliing.\" Rod Essig, agent with Creative Aitists Agency, adds, \"Don helped me out when I was just starting out 26 years ago. He always had a smile on his face and a great story to tell.\" Romeo is survived by his wife, Martha; children Boh Romeo, Fran Romeo, Lisa Romeo Rhines, and Julie Romeo Ryfa; two sisters; and four gi'juidcliikh'en. Funeral services were held June 27 in Omaha. Bob Romeo says his father died \"with a smile on his face,\" with his family by his side. \"My father col- lected life stories and [had] the abil- ity to tell them to people to help them, educate them, or just to make them laugh.\" The family asks that in lieu of flowers, memorial donations be made to the Don & Martha 4-H Scholai'ship Fund.

ROCK. R&B. RAP. DANCE. COUNTRY. LATIN. CLASSICAL .PRO AUDIO Gome's Thalia Zedeli Goes Solo For Matador BY JILL PESSELNICK Thalia Zedek hadn't planned on a solo career, but now that it looms with the July 31 release of Been Here and Gone (Matador), the for- mer lead vocalist of rough-and-tum- ble rock act Come isn't merely replajing her past. Singer/gmtarist Zedek — who also headed esteemed late-'8()s/early-'9()s indie bands Live Skull. Uzi. and Dan- gerous Birds — presents a moodier vision with Been Here, one that diverges from the sounds of her hard-driving bands. \"It's a different style of music,\" Zedek insists. \"It's not a guitar-rock band. I'm into dif- ferent textures now.\" Matador co-omier Gerard Cosloy stresses that although Zedek's solo album harks back to her earlier work, it displays true growth. \"Hiere's obvi- ously a common thread,\" he says, \"but even a cursory Usten to this album will reveal a more delicate, nuanced side of Thalia. Solo albums from moody singer/songwriters are a dime a fucking dozen. That the singer/ songwriter in question has smarts and guts to spare and possesses the most powerfol voice in rock — well, that's kind of unique.\" Zedek began exploring a subtler sound while still a member of Come in the late '90s, when she played New Kngland gigs that didn't need a full band setup. Before Come eventually disbanded, the group '%v'as kind of tak- ing a break, so I just started playing mostly covers witli [pianist] Beth Hcin- berg and with | viola player] David Michael Currj'. People were soon ask- ing me if I had recorded anjthing like this. I started writing origiiials geared toward that, then I really wanted to re- cord. It just came naturallj'.\" Been Here and Gone exposes Ze- dek's alto growl to a mixture of new tunes and covers accented with instru- ments that are unasual for edgj' sing- er/songwriter rock, such as the glodc- enspiel and trumpet Highlights include Zedek's \"TVeacherous Thing,\" which delves into a difficult relation-ship and features a spare guitar riff, and a cover of Leonaiid Cohen's \"Dance Me to the End of Love,\" in which Zedek spills out Jyri<B like she's deliveringa poetiy read- ing set to musia (Zedek's ovm songs are published by Thalia Zedek Publishing and are administered by Bug Music.) Zedek enlisted many of the musi- cians who had played the first small shows with her to contribute to the album, while also working closely with former Come guitarist Chris Brokaw. Despite the femiliarity of her collaborators, the process was less democratic than her past band expe- riences. \"The musicians definitely Icame up with] their own parts, but the songwriting wasn't collaborative, like vrith Come,\" Zedek .says. \"Every- thing now doesn't have to be a group decision — which is kind of nice.\" In addition to circulating advance copies o^Been Here and Gone, Mata- dor has shrewdly put together a nine- track promotionaJ-only sampler disc that gives those new to Zedek a taste of her talents via songs by Come (in- cluding a handful from the band's three Matador di.scs) and one each by Live Skull, Uzi, and Dangerous Birds. The sampler also includes the first single from Been Here — \"1926,\" a piano-ba.sed cover of a song original- ly recorded by early-'80s band V. Matador will be working \"19'26\" to modern-rock specialty shows and triple-A stations. Brian Turner, music/program director for Hoboken, NJ.'s public station WFMU, antici- pates pla>Tng fiuther tracks. Echoing Cosloj', Turner says, 'ThaUa's voice has real power and e.xpressiveness. 1 was blown aw^ay everj^ time I had the chance to see Come, especially the way her voice worked vrith the ten- sion in the guitars and rhythm section. We hope [Usteners] have the good taste to buy her record.\" When Zedek — who is booked by Steve Kaul of the Agency — goes on tour this September, a program of local press, radio spots, and in-stores will be cooitlinated. And she will likely play many nontraditional venues, such as bookstores and coffee shops, according to Matador product man- ager Donovan Finn. A retail campaign with the AUston, Mass.-based Newbury Comics chain is expected, and Matador will invest in listening posts with a number of smaller chains. Josh Mandel, co- owner of Other Music — a two-store, alternative-minded chain in New York and Cambridge, Mass. — says his 'Albums from moody singer/songwriters are a dime a dozen. That the singer/songwriter in question has smarts and guts to spare — that's unique. ' -OEfUnO COSLOY, MATADOR outlets have a strong history with Zedek \\ia her Boston-based bands. \"We sold a lot of Come records, and before that, Live Skull,\" Mandel says. \"I don't think [the solo project] will disappoint her fans at all, even though it's mellower. We post our employees' top 10 lists, and it's al- ready made a couple of them.\" Buffalo Springfield Boxed '60s Supergroup Gets Deluxe Rhino Set BY WES ORSHOSKI Working with Neil Young in choosing material for the new four- disc Buffalo Springfield boxed set \"was like watching a home movie and visiting your therapist at the same time,\" Stephen Stills says, before erupting in loud, throaty laughter. \"Neil and I just sat there and laughed and cried and held hands and hugged.\" \"At one point\" Stills adds, \"NeU and I even went, 'Wowl You can hear us — we're starting to deteriorate right there, we're starting to fall apart.' \" The fruits of that \"therapy\" see the light of day on July 17, when Rhino issues the 88-track, $59.98 Box Set, a project Young has been working on sporadically for about a decade. With more than 30 priceless demos — including several tracks featuring Young on solo guitar and lead vocal — Box Set is the first multi-disc set to honor the revered, short-lived .supergroup. CK'er ju.st 19 months in 1967 and '68, Buffalo Springfield established itself as a folk/country/rock pioneer, produc- ing the transcendent political anthem \"For What It's Worth\" along the way. Stills notes that, in addition to Young, production coordinator Joel Bernstein deserves much of the credit for unearthing, obtain- ing, listening to, and laboring over the music used on Box Set, \"I couldn't listen to it all at one time. Neil and I nearly went mad. It was so emotionally draining. It's like BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD revisiting your childhood.\" While Young worked on the proj- ect in between albums and tours, Bernstein invested a couple of years into cataloging the tracks consid- ered for Box Set. The collection in- cludes remastered vei-sions of the band's first two albums — Buffalo Springfield and Buffalo Springfield Ago in — ^in their entirety. The Los Angeles-based group's third and final album, tasf7Tm« Ai'ound, was released after the band (Stills, Young, singer/ guitarist Richie Furay, drummer Dewey Martin, and bassist Bruce Palmer, who was later replaced by Jim Messina) broke up. It was com- pleted without the full involve- ment of its members. Though the band wasn't entirely happy with Last Time Around, all but two tracks from the album are includ- ed on Box Set. Two of the songs have been remixed. Fiu-ay, now a minister Uving in Boulder, Colo., says the recent completion of Box Set also has him strolling down memory lane. \"I found myself sitting there .saying, 'Oh, my God. I forgot about this,' or 'I forgot that this was even recorded,\" \" he says. \"One of the biggest surprises for me was when we got around to the third disc, and I heard a song that I wrote called 'What a Day,' and Steven's singing it. That blew me away because. No. 1, it sounded really good. And, No. 2, 1 never remem- bered him even doing a vocal on it.

So it comes as something of a shuck to hear \"Glorious,\" the first single from his new Blue Star/XIII Bis Records album. Stranger Things. The song is so bright that it sounds as though Almond has finally stepped into the sunlight, as he sings: \"Feelings wider than the sky/Surround me on all sides.\" \" 'Glorious' is a hymn about inspiration and optimism,\" Almond says. \"People often expect me to come up with something darker. The last album |l»99's Open All Xight, on Instinct] wa-s ali more down- beat, so I wanted to start this one with a more uplifting song, some- thing that would surprise people.\" The single, released June 19 across most of Europe, will be released .July 2 in the U.K. Mark Langthorne — .Mmond's U.K. manager, working with 17.59 Management in London — says he is targeting \"serious, musician- oriented radio, rather than pop,\" although he admits that \" 'Glori- ous' seems to cross over to quite a few radio types.\" Almond will make a range of British TV ap- pearances in July to promote the single, including such shows as BBC's Tnp nfthc /'«/).■« and VHl's Talk Mtttfic. Almond's U.S. manager, Vicki Wickham of New York-based Take Out Productions, says that no singles will be released to American radio until next year because Stranger Things — re- leased June 18 in Europe — has no American distributor yet. Almond says, \"I lost out for years because my management were just interested in promoting me as a European artist, and America got neglected.\" But he hopes his new team of Lang- thorne and Wickham can change that situation. \"There's a lot of lost ground to catch up. I never set my sights on selling millions of records, but it would be nice to have them available there.\" Almond works wnth a new pro- ducer/arranger on Stranger Things: Johann Johannson from Iceland. Johan- nson had creat- ed experimen- tal pop for the group Luke, mi.xing strings, samples, and elec- tronic orchestration. Almond calls Johannson \"a kindred spirit\" musically; the two co-wrote many songs, and Almond lifted two songs for the album — \"Come Out\" and \"Love in the Time of Sci- ence\" — from an \"esoteric\" set that Johannson had written for Icelandic group Dip. Working with a \"very strict\" producer. Almond says, gave Sfra)iger Things \"a musical coherence\" that some of his earli- er efforts eschewed. Arrange- ments are soaring and melodra- matic — as Almond always is — but the sound finds a middle ground between the spare gothic synth- pop of Open All Night and the orchestral gi-andcur of 1991'h Ten- ement Symphonij (Sire/Reprise). \"I've found my direction more clearly,\" Almond explains. \"I've Storytelling Rockers.

From Ruth Brown To Ratt: Coffee-Table Book Charts Atlantic's First 50 Years H ISTORY LESSON: In many ways, the history of Atlantic Recortls is the history of modem pop music. Nowhere is that more apparent than in What I'd Sag: The Atlantic Sturg — 50 Yeaiv of Music (A Publishing Co., Ltd.), a new\" coffee-table book that tells in pic- tures and interviews the storj' of Atlantic's first half- centurj'. It is compulsory reading for any music fan. Arri\\'ing in stores in July, the extremely heavy book (it could actually ser\\'e as the coffee table, given its heft) features es.says by .some of music's top chroni- clers, including Nat HentoCT, Robert Christgan, David Fricke, and Will Friedwald. The real gems, though, are the photos — many of them extremely rare — and the accompanying text, culled from hundre<ls of interviews with re- cording artists, producers, record executives, and most important, Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, Whether they had their great- est success on Atlantic or on another label, most artists, it .seems, pas.sed through Atlantic's doors at some point, and their glorious stories are captured here in a way that continually delights and inspires. \"Although there were a great many IreconIs] that were not on Atlantic, they are somehow mirrored by the things on this company,\" Ertegun tells Billboard. \"We were friends with a lot of people who didn't record for us, and that's part of our history . . . the Beatles, the Who were all people we somehow admij*ed and got to know. We were music people.\" That simple statement comes across on every IKige. It's impossible to imagine many heads of labels today displaying the same kind of passion for artists — ^whether they sold 10 records or 10 million — that is captured in these pages. The book, which was originally supposed to be ready for Atlantic's 50th anniversary in 1997, was compiled and edited by C. Perry Richardson, but its heaJt was pro\\ided by Ertegun. \"When I finally saw the finished volume, I thought, 'My God, it's beauti- ful, it's incredible,' \" Ertegun says. Atlantic stalled humbly, but always had grand aspi- rations — including, at one point, releasing the entire works of William Shaliespeare on record, starting with Romeo and Juliet. \"The first rule was self- preser\\'ation,\" Ertegun says. \"Anything that resem- bled anything we thought would sell had some appeal to us. With [Shakespeare], we thought every college in the world would buy at least one copy. I don't think we sold 100 copies.\" With the confidence that only an executive who has experienced the uppermost reaches of success could exude, Ertegun adds, \"This is a very heavy book — it by Melinda Newman has many hundreds of p^s. What would be a heavier and bigger book would be the liistory of our flops. 1 think it would be a great lesson to the people. If we get one of five, that's tremendous. You've got to just get up to bat.\" Ertegun .says that, thankfully, he's forgotten many of his mis.ses, but a few stay burned in his memory. \"BID Graham aske<l me to come up [to San Francisco] and hear a band — he said it was mainly a guitar pkyer,\" recounts Ertegun. \"So I went up and said, 'Oh my God, his drummer's not here, there's no bass player, and there's only a [percussionist].' They messed around, and I said, 'I don't know, they're kind of good, but I don't know what I can do with them,' so . I did nothing. That was Santana.\" TjfjLj^ A much earlier misstep into country music in the '50s makes Ertegun chuckle: \"Of course, we couldn't afford to go down South to recoixl what we called hillbil- lies,\" he laughs. \"The only liiDbilly band we could get was BUI Haley & the Comets. We recorded them playing country music, and it was a disaster.\" The band moved to Decca, switched to recording rock songs. \"Whol'd I Say\" IWAMcSlvy SOTandM and — well, as they say, the rest is history.

Rising from that tumultuous chapter in the Ivy story is Long Distance, released in Japan last November by East West and finally arriving in the rest of the world July 10 via Nettwerk. Indeed, Ivy's 10-year career has been fijll of calamities that range from the aforementioned label problems to studio fires and disastrous tours. But it took another rock cliche — getting big in Japan while being ignored in the U.S. — to help the band find the inspiration to carry on. Without worldwide support, Long Distance took off in the Far East. It also brought Ivy to Nettwerk's attention. Long Distance was intended to be Ivy's first album for .550 Music/Epic, which had reissued 1997s Apartment Life, the group's final Atlantic release before being dropped by that label. But 550 Music/Epic severed ties with the band before Long Distance was finished, lb add insult to injury, the New York studio that Chase ran with Ivy's Adam Schlesinger and ex- Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha burnt to the ground during the recording process. Chase and Ivy vocalist Dominique Durand were also expecting their first child. \"We took a little hiatus because of Dominique's pregnancy, and the first ni^t of our little vacation, I get a call saying, 'You gotta come back! The whole building is on fire!,' \" Chase recalls. 'It took us two months to figure out where we were going to record.\" The solution: Chase and Durand's apartment, a setup that afforded the latter the opportunity to literally \"do some vocal takes while breast feed- ing.\" Although probably unintention- al, the homespun intimacy of this set- ting seeped into the sound of Long Distance, which wraps Ivy's melodic indie pop in inviting electronic tex- tures far removed from the group's earlier, guitar-centric leanings. \"The first songs Ivy recorded were jangly and simple and straight- ahead,\" Schlesinger says, who (along with the rest of the band) is published by Universal, ASCAP). \"We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It works well with Dominique's voice.\" ( Contiiiiied on page 20) BILLBOARD JULY 7, 2001 www.billbQard.com 13 Artists & Music Jimmy Eat World Rebounds On DreamWorks BY ERIC AIESE Being dropped by a major label could be a discouraging blow for many a band. But when Jimmy Eat World parted ways with Capitol Records in 1999, the quar- tet didn't fret. Instead, they embarked on a European tour as free agents. After several weeks, the group saved enough money to record Bleed American (July 24) an album that eventually landed them a deal with DreamWorks. In the absence of label dead- lines, singer/guitarist Jim Ad- kins says the group w'as able to properly contemplate every cre- ative decision while making Bleed American. \"We've really taken our time — from picking tunes to dealing with manage- ment. Every step of the way, we've made sure to do exactly what we wanted to do.\" With the album completed and a core cult of fans waiting, Jimmy Eat World was an attractive enti- ty for major labels. \"It was high- ly competitive to sign the band, since they had a finished record,\" says DreamWorks A&R execu- tive Luke Wood. \"The industry heard it and fell in love with it.\" Bleed American features songs that range from the rapid-fire, guitar-charged tone of the title cut and \"A Praise Chorus\" to the tender \"Hear You Me.\" Wood thinks the element that is most attractive about this project is that the band clearly hasn't compromised its initial vision — to be naturally versatile. \"They're a modern rock band, an active rock band, and a pop band. But they do this with a tremendous amount of credibili- ty. Jimmy Eat World is ulti- mately a band that's completely driven by songwriting. At the heart of this record are 1 1 great songs — every single one of them [contains] a unique voice, a unique point of view.\" Adkins says, \"The lyrics are observational and autobiograph- ical to some extent.\" Although all members of the band are active in writing, each plays a different part, he says. \"Usually, I'll have an idea first, then it'll get tweaked around with the band and maybe with Mark [Trombino, producer]. It's not a true team collaboration, but we all have our roles. Everyone's good at what they do. We found a way to make it work.\" DreamWorks' marketing plan for the album extends well into next year. At the heart of the plan is \"touring, touring, touring\" that JIMMY EAT WORLD will continue through the end of the year, Wood says. After a month spent touring Australia, Europe, and Asia, the band (which is booked by Tim Edwards at Chicago's Flower Booking Agency) returns to the U.S. in time for the Warped Tour, per- forming on dates from July 26 through Aug. 5. Following that jaunt, Jimmy joins Blink-182 in Canada and the Northwest U.S., along with Weezer on the Canadian dates. The group will headline its own tour in September. \"We want to put this band in an environment where the natural energy between them and their fans is addictive and contagious,\" Wood says. \"The more people see that, the more they'll want to be a part of it.\" As Bleed American was shopped to labels earlier this year, copies found their way to key radio outlets and made it on the air before the band even had a record deal. The album's title cut was serviced to active and modem rock June 5, and a three-song sampler sent to college radio has helped propel the band up the college charts. The preliminary video for \"Bleed American,\" serviced to MTV2 and regional local video channels, was shot at a recent sellout show in the band's home- town, Tempe, Ariz. \"We had amazing footage [that] we turned into a video,\" says DreamWorks' Darin Soler, product manager for the album. But he adds that the label plans to produce a standard, big-budget video for the song to be ready by late-July. The Internet will also be a key factor in DreamWorks' promo- tional efforts surrounding Bleed American. The label recently gave away a limited-edition, one- track disc to fans over the Inter- net, exhausting its supply in just days after receiving thousands of responses. DreamWorks has also assembled online street teams that will spread news of the al- bum and drum up interest on musical bulletin boards. The act's Web site, jimmyeat- world.com, will be relaunched July 4 with new features, and the label has launched a second, secret site exclusively for fans that buy the CD. The enhanced disc will link to the new site, where a new live video can be seen, and live tracks may soon become available. For Adkins, the new album brings with it optimism, yet he holds no grudge against the past. \"We made a lot of ill-informed decisions in the past, but now we're really grateful for them. The mistakes we learned were priceless. You don't learn that in a music-business class. \"Given our physical limitations and everything we know about music, we've done the best work we can,\" Adkins says. \"I'm proud that we're all completely ourselves, we've been really lucky, and I'm thankfiil for that.\" Dante Visits Jessica. RCA artist Dante, right, was among the weil-wlshers at a New York bash to celebrate the recent release of Jessica Simpson's new Columbia opus. Irresistible. Dante is currently promoting \"Lawdy. Lawdy.\" the first single from his debut disc. Inferno.

B patf or presant Heatwelw title 67 on The Hot 100 in February 1989, from his Capitol album, The Stars We Are — which was his only solo set to hit The Bill- board 200, hitting No. 147 the same month. Even when Soft Cell had a .series of hit singles during the early '80s, the duo only sent one single to the American singles charts; \"Tainted Love,\" which hit No. 8 in May 1982. So despite a successful European career, Almond is frequently perceived as a one-hit wonder stateside — something he has recently learned to handle. \" 'Tainted Love' has been both a curse and a blessing,\" Almond says. \"There have been times I've wanted to run away from it, but I've learned to embrace and ac- cept it. If it can open new doors for me, that's fine.\" SOFT CELL REUNITES One new door that's opening is actually an old one. After Soft Cell broke up in 1984, Almond went solo, and former bandmate Dave Ball found success as a pro- ducer and as a musician with techno act Grid. But now that they've found success apart. Almond and Ball are getting back together. \"Both of us had intended at some point to do a Soft Cell proj- ect, but the fear of raising old ghosts was daunting,\" Almond says. But in March, the duo played three dates at a new Lon- don venue. Ocean, \"as an experi- ment to see how people would react.\" And the reaction was tremendous: \"Man and machine in perfect harmony,\" London's Evening Standard raved in a con- cert review. With the experiment a success, a reunited Soft Cell is going on the road — to America. The Wota- palava gay music festival is a 17- date amphitheater tour starting July 13 in Miami and ending Aug. 11 in Houston, covering such cities as New York, San Francis- co, and Detroit along the way. Soft Cell will appear on the bill alongside the pair that, in many ways, picked up where they left off: the Pet Shop Boys. \"It's a great thing to get the two most influential British syn- thesizer duos on the same bill,\" Almond says. Rufus Wainwright and Magnet- ic Fields are also part of the Wotapalava line-up. There are no plans for Almond to play solo dates to push Stranger Things during Soft Cell's Wotapalava tour. Still, re- newed interest in Soft Cell may help Almond land an American license for Stranger Things, says Wickham, who is currently look- ing for a label to release the al- bum stateside in early 2002. \"Anything that keeps Marc's name out there helps.\" After Wotapalava, Almond will play European solo dates in Sep- tember. Then Soft Cell will tour the U.K. in October, to coincide with a Universal release there of a greatest-hits package contain- ing new remixes. After that, the group will finish up an album of new material for release in 2002 — Soft Cell's first new set since Sire/Warner Bros.' This Last Night in Sodom in 1984. Almond and Ball will produce the as-yet-untitled album. They're currently in negotiations to land a label for the project, which will include a few new songs they'll play live on tour: \"Mono- culture,\" \"Divided Souls,\" and \"Last Chance.\" \"I don't ever want to do Soft Cell permanently again. I like the freedom of being solo,\" Almond says"
