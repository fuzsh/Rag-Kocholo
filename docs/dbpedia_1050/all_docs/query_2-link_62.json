        "text": "Lainey Wilson has released \"Hang Tight Honey,\" from \"Whirlwind,\" her forthcoming album, scheduled to arrive on Aug. 23, 2024.\n\nLainey Wilson has released her latest single, the countrified funk-rock hybrid \"Hang Tight Honey,\" as she prepares for the possibility of ending May as a six-month cycle in which she became the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year.\n\nThe single is the latest from \"Whirlwind,\" her forthcoming fifth studio album, scheduled to arrive on Aug. 23, 2024.\n\nWilson's album is available for pre-order/pre-save/pre-add and is currently available on Lainey's merch store at shop.laineywilson.com. Wilson's \"Wild Horses\" fan club members can pre-order a limited edition, signed black-and-white \"Whirlwind\" vinyl.\n\nAbout \"Hang Tight Honey\" and her forthcoming album, in general, Wilson notes, \"This new chapter of music is the most cathartic and personal piece of art I've ever made. I hope this record brings some peace to your whirlwind and wraps its arms around you like it did for me.\"\n\nHer latest track follows the release of the anthemic song \"Country's Cool Again\" earlier this year.\n\nDescribed via a press statement as being \"rooted in the spirit of hardworking women, empowerment and resilience,\" \"Hang Tight Honey\" was written by Wilson, Driver Williams, Jason Nix, and Paul Sikes and is described as an \"infectious groove\" bearing \"empowering lyrics\" and infusing classic rock stylings with a \"fresh, contemporary vibe.\"\n\nWilson's \"Country's Cool Again\" North American 2024 headlining tour arrives in Nashville on May 31 and June 1 at Ascend Amphitheater. This will follow her May 16 appearance at the Academy of Country Music Awards (ACM) stage in Frisco, Texas, before her performances at CMA Fest from June 6-9, 2024.\n\n2024 has already seen Wilson featured in a Super Bowl 58 commercial, hosting a Nashville pop-up bar, kicking off her world tour in Australia, preparing for 40 domestic dates extending through Nov. 2024 and a forthcoming Hulu special.\n\n\"I realize that it seems like I'm everywhere right now. Every single show we play gets crazier and crazier these days,\" Wilson told The Tennessean."
