        "text": "There was a rock revival and there was Delta Goodrem. There were the stalling careers of various female pop figures and there was Delta Goodrem. There was the rise of a new king and queen of R&B. And, yes, there was Delta Goodrem.\n\nAlthough she's not known in the US and Europe, and is still a rising star in Britain, this year Delta Goodrem bestrode Australian music like no one has since John Farnham in 1986-87. Fittingly, as the year drew to a close, Innocent Eyes - Goodrem's debut album of solid, sometimes classy piano ballads - overtook Farnham's record (with Whispering Jack) of most weeks at No.1. Goodrem has spent half of the past year at the top of the charts, scoring four No.1 singles along the way and winning seven ARIA Awards.\n\nWhen people were buying Delta Goodrem, they may have noticed that guitars, turned up loud and played by boys in denim and sideburns, were stirring the underground. Local acts such as Jet, Casanovas and the best of them all, New Zealand's the Datsuns, pushed the Rolling Stones/AC-DC buttons; Americans such as the Strokes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the White Stripes found the blues and post-punk buttons; and Britain's the Darkness found the hitherto laughed at Bon Jovi/Thin Lizzy/Queen/leopard-print button.\n\n(Actually, the best guitar albums of the year were made by pop acts such as Fountains Of Wayne but they're neither cool nor sexy enough to get the attention.)\n\nBut if the noise was coming from the underground, the sales were coming in the shape of Justin Timberlake and Beyonce Knowles, who confirmed R&B as the dominant musical form of the year. Holly Valance went out backwards, Kylie Minogue failed to set the world on fire and Britney Spears fell short of former glories. But Timberlake - the former boy band member who parlayed a neo-Michael Jackson blend of pop and R&B into a hit-filled album - and Knowles, the central figure in trio Destiny's Child, who flavoured her own pop/R&B with hip-hop figures, racked up pop culture attention like a dozen Deltas in one.\n\nHilarious, precarious and badly dressed, a falsetto to scare the horses, the resurrection of the leopard print in rock - the Darkness are equal parts Kiss, Bon Jovi, Queen and Iron Maiden. But this isn't parody, it's a love for the brilliance and the stupidity of hard rock matched by genuine songwriting talent that gives you a dozen songs to sing and play air guitar to.\n\nIdentity Crisis, Shelby Lynne (EMI)\n\nShe'd been a country artist, a white soul singer and nearly a pop star before this album, but the aptly titled Identity Crisis is Shelby Lynne's defining work. A dozen songs that reach into messy love affairs and come out the other side, that stretch from New Orleans swinging blues to Memphis-soaked soul, that give her voice, with its soul richness, rock edge and country delicacy, room to breathe.\n\nSpeakerboxx/The Love Below, Outkast (BMG)\n\nIt's two albums in one double disc, essentially a solo album each by Outkast pair, Big Boi and Andre 3000. Restless as ever, the pair shift the ground beneath hip-hop, funk, soul and pop, throwing so many ideas at you that you can be slow to grasp them all. But from the sensual groove of Big Boi's The Way You Move to the supremely catchy cocksure swagger of Andre's Hey Ya, you do well to hang on for the fabulous ride.\n\nIt's a bit country noir, a bit Go-Betweens, a bit just atmospheric pop music that plays in the shadows and then something else that is hard to define but seems out of its time, or maybe just timeless. There's not much to it: piano, a voice that can be croaky one minute and soaring the next, guitar and acoustic bass, but Ward creates beauty and honesty out of it.\n\nWant One, Rufus Wainwright (DreamWorks/Universal)\n\nHe can sing like a dirty choirboy or a saintly roue with a lazy drawl that threatens to turn into affectation but never does. He can write a witty or sardonic lyric, but has an unnerving knack of making the personal arrive out of the blue. And his songs can swing from theatrical, almost operatic, moments to sheer pop bliss.\n\nHail To The Thief, Radiohead (EMI)\n\nThe sound of a band that's decided to stop hating itself. The bubbling electronic feel and scattering-the-birds rhythms are still there, but also more layered instrumentation and more structured lyrics. There wasn't a more intelligent, emotion-pricking album this year. Radiohead are still the most interesting rock band we've got.\n\nOn their second album, Vancouver's New Pornographers created a burst of zippy power pop with keyboards and guitars. There are hooks galore - vocal hooks, guitar hooks and more - seriously funny lyrics that are too smart for mere throwaway songs, and unrestrained fun.\n\nThink Tank, Blur (Parlophone/EMI)\n\nThere's a languid Hawaiian-sounding track and a mix of punk and North African coated with paranoia. A dreamy, gently painful Sweet Song and a Bowie-in-Berlin cool, funky thing also tickles the brain and washes away all sins with a closing track that is a grand Radiohead-like stab at replicating a cracked soul.\n\n1972, Josh Rouse (Ryko/Stomp)\n\nSome sweet soul funk, California pop, both Nick Drake pastoral folk and the more American electrified version, and, in the quite lovely Sparrows Over Birmingham, a mix of gospel and country. Even when the lyrics cut across loneliness and depression, they make it seem that feeling low isn't the worst thing on a day when it could turn bright any moment."
