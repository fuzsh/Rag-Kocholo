        "text": "Sequence Details\n\nSong Title: Hangin' 'Round The Mistletoe\n\nArtist: Brooks And Dunn\n\nDuration: 2:43\n\nPurchase Music: Amazon Music Link\n\nVideo Samples\n\nVideo Sample - RGBPlus Layout (and Singing Faces)\n\nVideo not currently available for this sequence layout\n\nVideo Sample - Traditional Layout\n\nExchange and Upgrade Dates\n\nTraditional Layout RTG to YCM Upgrade Dates: Purchased within 3 years = full credit; 3-5 years = half credit; more than 5 years = no discount.\n\nRGBPlus Layout Release Date: N/A\n\nExchange Credit Date Range for Previous Purchase (Traditional RTG/YCM to RGBPlus): N/A\n\nExchange Credit Date Range for New Purchase (Traditional RTG/YCM to RGBPlus): One Year From YOUR Purchase Date\n\nPlease see the 'Upgrades' tab for more detailed information about discount and exchange credit.\n\nThis sequence purchase does NOT include a music file.\n\nLight-O-Rama is great at making the lights dance but the required music is not part of the sequence or the sequence price. We suggest purchasing this music through Amazon (or the alternative link provided on the first tab) so it is licensed to you for personal use.\n\nThe duration of the music must be the length we specify. Any other music version might cause the effects in this sequence not to be in time with the music.\n\nThe music files you purchase must be downloaded to your computer. The Sequencer cannot access cloud-based files stored only in Amazon Music. If you do not download music files immediately after purchase, visit the 'Amazon Cloud Player.' Find the appropriate music for your sequence (the music you just purchased), drag it to the download section of the screen (typically on the right side of the Amazon Cloud Player window) and wait until the file is transferred to your computer. After this is complete, you can run the installer program that came with your sequence purchase.\n\nWhat if Amazon removed the music? From time to time, Amazon removes the ability to purchase the music we've recommended to go with our sequence. If this happens, please send a message to our help desk to let us know.\n\nAmazon.com not available in your country? Locate the music in your country and purchase the file. Make sure the music is the same duration as we require for this sequence. Download the music file to your computer. Now install this newly purchased Light-O-Rama sequence. The Light-O-Rama installation program will find the downloaded music associated with the new sequence and link everything together if the music file is the same length.\n\nCommercial Entities: If you charge for entry to see your show, you will need an extra form of music licensing, such as from BMI, ASCAP, SESAC, etc. Your finance department should have more information about which music you are licensed to use already, or be able to fill out the application for a new license if needed.\n\nHow do you install this sequence on your computer?\n\nYou should already have a working version of Light-O-Rama's ShowTime Sequencing Suite software installed on your Windows based computer before downloading this sequence.\n\nThe music for the sequence should already be purchased before you attempt to install the sequence on your computer. You can find the Amazon link in the 'Description' tab.\n\nTraditional Layout ‘Ready To Go’ and “You Can Modify’ sequences require LOR 3.8.0 or higher. The license level you use (Basic, Standard, Pro, etc.) determines how many controllers you can use.\n\nRGBPlus sequences require either version 5.6.0 or later, or 6.2.0 or later (depending on when it was released). The version required is indicated right above the purchase price of each sequence. You must be using the 'Pro' license level to use any of the smart RGB effects in the sequence.\n\nSinging Face Standalone sequences require version 5.3.0 or later at the Advanced or Pro license level.\n\nThe ShowTime Sequencing Suite is available at several different levels. The level determines how many light controllers the sequence will operate.\n\nDemo: See all the features and effects, but no commands are sent to any controllers\n\nBasic: Will work with AC controller ID 01 and 02\n\nBasic Plus: Will work with AC controller ID 01, 02, 03 and 04\n\nStandard: Will work with AC controller ID 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 and 08\n\nAdvanced: Will work with all AC or CMB24D controllers, including ID 20 through 2F. Will NOT control smart pixel props that use Motion Effects.\n\nPro: Will work with all controllers and Unit IDs. Required for the use of the smart RGB effects in the RGBPlus sequences.\n\nAfter purchasing this sequence, an email will be sent to you with download instructions. Download the zip folder following the instructions. Open the folder and double click on the installer program (.exe) inside. The installer will prompt you to locate the music on your computer, which you should have already purchased using the Amazon link before attempting to install this sequence.\n\nThe program will unpack the sequence and install it in your default ShowTime Sequencing Suite directory. Upon completion, open up the Light-O-Rama Sequencer and navigate to the newly installed sequence in your default sequence directory.\n\nIf the audio is not working (it should work automatically though if you located it during the installer prompt), open the Sequencer program, click on the menu options Sequence -> Media File. navigate to the correct music in your audio directory, select it and save your work. Watch this video if you need a visual: https://youtu.be/pKfytk4N_eU\n\nFor more detailed installation instructions (like troubleshooting, learning how to put the effects from our sequence into your own layout, modifying your networks, or adding your shows to an SD card), click here.\n\nPersonal Use License\n\nThe purchase of this sequence as a residential customer licenses you to use the sequence file and effects at one location (generally a home residence). Light-O-Rama retains the sole licensing rights to sell this sequence and all modified versions of this sequence. By purchasing this sequence, you agree that the sequence will be for personal use only at one location and not shared or resold in any way.\n\nIf you are discovered reselling or sharing purchased Light-O-Rama sequences, it will result in immediate revocation of your sequence download/usage access with no refund of your purchase. Depending on the extent of the sharing or selling, your license may be temporarily suspended until appropriate compensation has been paid to Light-O-Rama.\n\nCommercial Use License\n\nIf purchasing as a commercial client, Light-O-Rama sequences may not be re-sold or used at multiple for-profit locations per purchase. One sequence must be purchased per commercial location, or other for-profit entities with multi-location shows. This will result in your purchasing multiple copies of the same sequence, one per location. Please contact us regarding a custom order for multi-location licensing.\n\nLight-O-Rama retains the sole licensing rights to sell this sequence and all modified versions of this sequence.\n\nDiscovery of sequence reselling, sharing, or unauthorized multi sequence use will result in immediate revocation of your sequence download/usage access with no refunds until the outstanding multi-location balance fee is paid."
