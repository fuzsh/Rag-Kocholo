        "text": "Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, or known as Lana Del Rey, is a music influencer where most people recognized her music started with a single hit titled “Young and Beautiful”, where the song used as a soundtrack in “The Great Gatsby” movie in 2013. Her music is astonishingly great, her face is adorable and all… But did you know Lana as much as I do? I’m going to describe how much I know about her records and stuff, happy reading!\n\nwhen it all started…\n\nLana Del Rey started her music career such as writing lyrics and arranged some instruments when she was 18, around 2006 she released her first unreleased album titled Sirens. Then she released a public extended play titled Kill Kill with the help of 5 Points Record as her first label in the music industry. The album has three songs such as “Kill Kill”, “Yayo”, and “Gramma (Blue Ribbon Sparkler Trailer Heaven)”. Personally, I think this record is such a great startup but not acceptable for some audience because the lyrics contain a lot of ambiguous meaning and for people in 2000’s, a music like this is not that acceptable in our ears since people tend to listen to synth/pop kind of music. Kill Kill is a record with the indie-pop genre. But as a fan, I sure always like every type of music she released, except Lana Del Ray.\n\nAnother early record of her was sometimes referred to as Lana Del Ray A.K.A. Lizzy Grant, Nevada or A.K.A. among others. Lana recorded this track with her friend David Kahne as her producer. This debut studio album writen and recorded around 2007 and digitally released by 5 Points Record on January 4th, 2010. In my honest opinion I don’t really like this album because, for me, this is not reflecting her true feelings as if she didn’t feel this record at all. But sure her records is always been a timeless record, and not all people like her in this era.\n\nthe time when Lana started to get known..\n\nBorn To Die is a very first record Lana get serious into because you can tell it by the way you listened to her songs on this album. Every each of the track tells you different stories, and her voice is coming into a different kind of vibe. It’s kind of hard to explain for me because this album is the first thing I listened to before everything. I still remember perfectly the first song I heard from her on this album is Blue Jeans. And at that time, I started to become her fan. But based on data I got, people like Summertime Sadness rather than Blue Jeans. But I think that’s fine though.\n\nfor me, the “Born To Die” record is not complete with the “Paradise Edition” because it has more of her songs that contains her released and/or remastered from old tracks she ever put in her debut album. Not all the tracks though but the tracks in this album is more of the concept itself. Like eating spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. The album digitally contains 2 disc where the track list contains 8 new recorded track and the rest is Born To Die original track list. In total there are 23 tracks. But you can see the stand-alone album of this titled Paradise on Spotify.\n\n..I almost forgot this one LMAO\n\nOkay, basically this record is a “Soundtrack” for Lana Del Rey’s self-directed short-movie, Tropico, where she put this as an EP but I think you can’t find it anywhere including iTunes or Spotify. But don’t worry! You can hear the whole tracks in the short movie and it’s really beautiful. The short movie is 27 minutes long but I can guarantee you’ll love it. With her poems and her acting, the worth of your time is getting paid as soon as you finish the movie. The moral of it and the message behind all the movie is pretty well expressed. 100/10.\n\ndark ages? I think so, but Lana hates this record in the end…\n\nfor her fans, this record explaining the fan’s life most of the time. Each track is unique. The lyrics, the tune, the meaning of all the song is beautiful. Personally, from Ultraviolence, I like Florida Kilos and Brooklyn Baby. No, I like them all but well, as a fan I like every single of her songs. Lana Del Rey admitted in some interview that this record explaining her past but since she’s happier than she used to, all the tracks in this album are nothing but a glitch of reflection from her bad past. In my very honest opinion, this album is the best album from her. I like dark things.\n\nbeautiful, and timeless record.. the beginning of Lana’s happiness.\n\nFor me, Honeymoon is a record where she started found her peace with herself. How can I know this? The soft tune, her soft voice, the ‘not-so-depressing’ lyrics is such a bright sign that she found something beautiful when she wrote her song or arranged the music. But well Lana isn’t Lana without a little bit of dark or sad lyrics so you may find one or more lyrics where it expresses another of her character. Personally, I like Music to Watch Boys to and Art Deco. A very beautiful song and it explains to me a little bit.\n\nlast.. but not least…\n\nFinally, the latest album of her, Lust for Life. Many people don’t like this Lana, but I LOVED THIS LANA. Look at her, smiling and looked so grateful and happy. Compared to all album with her as the portrait, this one is more calming for me. I mean, as a fan, what I wanted for her is for her to be happy and more care about her fans. People think this Lana is boring as hell. In my honest opinion, she’s like—storytelling her life journey throughout all the music she created. She created a new universe, where I loved the most. Nevertheless, I don’t have many words to explain how blessed and grateful I am to have this album on my ears and manage to buy all her records with my own money. Even though the chance for me to meet her is still small, I believe someday I will meet her in such fortunate events.\n\nThat’s all from me, folks! If you liked this article please do share and comment your thoughts on my writing here. And as a bonus, I’ll post all her tracks from the very beginning until this very day I found from Lana Del Rey’s fan Wikipedia.
