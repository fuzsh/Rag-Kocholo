        "text": "Orbray started production of sapphire record stylus in the late 1940s, leveraging its gem processing technology since its inception. After that, the record stylus evolved steadily, and at the height of the record boom, we sold record cartridges and record accessories centered on diamond record stylus, and made the name of Orbray roar all over the world.\n\nAt that time, with the cooperation of Mr. Kei Ikeda, we created a booklet called \"The Story of Record Stylus\". We would like to divide it into several times and introduce the contents little by little.\n\nChronology of Stylus Tip and Gramophone Record\n\nEvents in the Record Industry"
