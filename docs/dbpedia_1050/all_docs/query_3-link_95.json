        "text": "<strong>GRAMOPHONE</strong> <strong>RECORD</strong> WHAT IS A <strong>GRAMOPHONE</strong> <strong>RECORD</strong>? A gramophone record is an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed modulated spiral groove. OTHER NAMES Other names include phonograph record (in American English), vinyl record (when made of polyvinyl chloride) or simply record. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE <strong>GRAMOPHONE</strong> <strong>RECORD</strong> Gramophone records replaced the phonograph cylinders by the 1920’s. By the late 1980’s, they disappeared as a result of technological advances, in particular, digital media. In 2008, they regained popularity, shipping out 2.9 units in that year. Records are used widely by DJs and audiophiles in their respective jobs, and are also used by young adults. HISTORY OF THE PHONOGRAPH The first phonoautograph was invented in 1857 by Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville of France. The invention was built by using a vibrating pen to graphically represent sound on discs of paper and was intended to solely depict the visual characteristics of sound. In 1877, Thomas Edison developed the phonautograph into a machine, the phonograph that was capable of replaying the recordings made. The recordings were made on tinfoil, and were initially intended to be used as a voice recording medium, typically for office dictation. The phonograph dominated the market until the 1880’s. DISC <strong>RECORD</strong>S The first disc records appeared in 1888 by Emile Berliner. The main problem with this record was that it had poor sound quality. With work done by Eldridge R. Johnson improved the fidelity to a point where they were as good as cylinders. Berliner and Johnson merged companies to form the Victor Talking Machine Company and dominated the market with their products for many years. The Amberol cylinder was invented in 1909 by Edison, had a playing time of 4.5 minutes at 160 rpm, and was made of celluloid, an early plastic, far less fragile than the earlier wax. 78 RPM DISC DEVELOPMENTS Early disc recordings were produced in a variety of speeds ranging from 60 to 130 rpm, and a variety of sizes. In America in 1900, the two leading manufacturers of flat records were Columbia, which used 80 rpm as its speed, and Victor, which used 76 rpm. Since one company’s records were playable on the other’s machines, it is only logical that the eventual standard speed would be in the middle. By 1925, the speed of the record became standardized at a nominal value of 78 rpm, although this differed slightly between America and the rest of the world (America was 78.26 rpm and the rest of the world was 77.92 rpm). ACOUSTICAL AND ELECTRICAL <strong>RECORD</strong>INGS The earliest records were made entirely acoustically, as technology was not available for electrical recordings at that time. There were many disadvantages for acoustical recording: sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was very irregular. As a result, very few instruments could be completely recorded."
