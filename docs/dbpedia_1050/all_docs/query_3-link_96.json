        "text": "ABOUT\n\nListening to LPs is a different and relaxing experience. Put the record on the turntable, sit down in a comfortable chair, and browse through album artwork while listening to 15 - 25 minutes of uninterrupted music with a warm sound that you just can’t get from digital. At Gramophone, we’re so excited about the return of vinyl that we now sell not only the hardware to play records, but we have created a new selection of high-quality LPs as well. Find the turntables you love at our Online Store or visit us at one of our locations.\n\nTAKE THIS FOR A SPIN\n\nTHE HOBBYIST\n\nTurntables are no longer just for the old-fashioned and the traditional audiophile, Gramophone has a great collection of entry-level turntables for the person who is just starting in the vinyl world and for those who love vinyl as a hobby. Start listening with a high-quality, affordable turntable that works with both conventional and Hi-Fi AV systems. Turntable technology has come a long way and you can now hook your table up with either wired or wireless speaker systems for an easy and enjoyable listening experience.\n\nTHE ENTHUSIAST\n\nWith modern designs and wide color selections, transparent elements, and sleek edges, turntables can match almost any taste. Tri-balance turntables ensure both aesthetic and mechanical balance, while ultra low-friction bearings and quality metal tonearms in tandem create a turntable that is both beautiful to look at and listen to.\n\nTHE AUDIOPHILE\n\nA precision turntable is a complete package that is more than the sum of its parts. It lets you hear music exactly the way it was recorded and is meticulously adjusted for the perfect playback. Audiophile-grade turntables feature high-end elements such as magnetically suspended platters, motor drives, magnetic sapphire tonearms, and elliptical diamond styluses. This advanced technology creates an experience like no other. If that's not worth someone's undivided attention, we're not sure what is."
