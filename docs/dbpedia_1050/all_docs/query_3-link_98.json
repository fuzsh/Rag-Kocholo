In archives are preserved at Vienna some 3000 records, at Paris 4000, at Berlin 10,000, and collections of similar size are to be found at important centres in all parts of the world. The first use of gramophone records in the exact sciences was in a rather premature attempt to analyse the physical nature of vowel sounds. Enlarged tracings of the grooves were obtained by a lever system from the slowly rotating record and were assumed to represent the original sounds.",
