Get two free Vue cinema tickets every month with Sky Cinema.

Use your tickets at any Vue cinema in the UK or Ireland, at any time Sunday – Thursday.

You’ll need the MySky app to get started.

How to get free cinema tickets

Open the MySky app on your phone or tablet.

Select Sky VIP in the bottom right, then tap the Your Vue Tickets tile (Something not working? Try reinstalling the app).

Enter Confirm your email, read and accept the T&Cs and click Claim your codes.

You’ll see two codes – each lets you book one standard seat.

Copy the codes or make a note of them and go to myvue.com.

Find a film you want to watch, select your cinema location and choose your seat type: Regular, Saver or Super Saver.

At the seat selection stage enter your code(s) and go through to checkout.

You can also get a QR code from the MySky app, and use this to book tickets at a Vue cinema. Just select tap here underneath your codes.

Once you’ve got your codes you’ll have until the end of the month to use them. These codes can’t be used alongside any other promotional offer, but can be used with Vue Member rewards.

There’s a weekly limit of codes available. If there aren’t any left when you use the MySky app, you can try again next week.
