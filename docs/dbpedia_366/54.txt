You will have to watch the first Code 8 to understand the main characters and where Part II starts, but there is a several year gap in between movies. Part II is primarily a drama movie like the first, has more action, and explores corruption within the police.

Most of what I have to say is the same as in my review of the previous film: most of the movie explores a dystopian sci-fi world following the drama and struggle of a protagonist with super powers finding his place.

In terms of overall quality, Part II was equally as interesting and entertaining as the first (for good or for worse), and I would loosely recommend it to sci-fi fans.
