        "text": "Whether we realize it or not, we seek out certain tropes when we're searching for a new novel to read. If someone recommends a book to us, we want to know what it's about in broad terms. And these broad terms often include not just the genre, but also the common tropes used in the story.\n\nEvery reader has their tropes of choice. Some may have a broad range of preferred tropes, while others may only stick to a handful.\n\nAnd as a writer, it's essential to get to know the most common tropes both in and out of your genres. Go straight to the source by finding out which Amazon Categories you want to target, and researching what tropes are popular for your story.\n\nPlus, you'll learn in this complete list of book tropes what can also apply to your book.\n\nLiterary Tropes vs Genre Tropes\n\nBefore we get to the list, I need to clear something up. The tropes we'll be talking about today aren't literary tropes, which include things like irony, metaphor, and hyperbole, to name a few.\n\nNo, we'll be discussing tropes in the more modern sense of the word as they pertain to fiction.\n\nIn short, a trope is a plot structure, theme, storyline, character trait, motif, or plot device that is commonly used in storytelling. Whether you mean to or not, you use tropes in your writing. We all do. And that's why it's so important to study them. Because once you know your tropes, you can use them (or avoid them) to please your readers.\n\nFormat Beautiful Professional Books\n\nEasy to use, and and full of amazing features, you can quickly turn your book into a professional book.\n\nCheck It Out\n\nAre Tropes Good or Bad?\n\nYou’ll often hear people disparaging tropes as something to be avoided. Like most writing advice, this should be taken with a grain of salt. Tropes exist for a reason—because people respond to them. That’s not to say that you should mindlessly use any trope you recognize. As a writer, part of your art is providing stories that are unique but not so unique as to be unrecognizable as a thriller or a romance or whatever genre you write in.\n\nTropes change over time, and that’s a good thing. But they only change when writers dare to use them in different ways—or create new tropes that readers love.\n\nSo as we move through this list of book tropes, keep that in mind. They’re neither good nor bad. It’s how you use a trope that matters.\n\nI'll mention a bit about them and try to break them down into the most common genres. (Spoiler alert: romance has a lot of tropes.)\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nHow Do Tropes Affect Book Sales?\n\nMany readers start with tropes when looking for their next book. So, if your book includes a trope that many readers enjoy, you increase its chances of being discovered. This is because readers will type these tropes directly into the Amazon search bar- looking for things like “Magical Creatures”, “Enemies To Lovers”, “Twist Ending”, and more.\n\nBefore writing your book, it's important to see which tropes are popular among readers. Having a well sought after trope can help your book appear in more places on Amazon, meaning more people will find your story. A top quality book that appears high in trope search results is a recipe for success.\n\nFortunately, with a little research, it's easy to see which tropes are being actively searched for on the Amazon store. Use this to your advantage to attract more readers.\n\nFor example, if you are writing a Romance book, you can use the search result earnings for common tropes to estimate their popularity.\n\nData provided by Publisher Rocket\n\nThis type of research can apply to all genres- so be sure to dig in and find out if there is a hungry audience for the tropes in your story. Once you have your trope, you can also use keyword research to maximize its effectivity.\n\nFind and Discover Profitable Tropes\n\nOver 72,000+ authors, NYT bestsellers, and publishing companies use Publisher Rocket to find the most profitable book tropes readers crave – you can too.\n\nFor example, say you are writing a Fantasy book about magical creatures. Well, you may want to research which of those beasts are most popular in the market, in order to help determine your cover design and specific keywords. With earnings for different magical creatures, you can immediately see that some keywords within a trope are far more popular than others:\n\nData provided by Publisher Rocket\n\nSo… when you look into tropes, be sure to consider how you can use their popularity, because it can have a big impact on sales.\n\nComplete List of Book Tropes\n\nWhile I've done my best to piece these tropes together in genres, it's important to note that many of them are used across many genres.\n\nJust because you see a trope under a certain heading doesn't mean you can't use it in another genre. After all, the best way to please readers is by giving them a story that's at once both familiar and fresh. And a great way to do this is by mixing multiple tropes.\n\nJust make sure you do your research first because there are certain tropes that are expected in certain genres (happily ever after in romance stories, for example).\n\nAction & Adventure Tropes\n\nAction and Adventure tropes can also be found in Fantasy, Thriller, Mystery, and Science Fiction stories.\n\nHidden Treasure\n\nPuzzle Solving\n\nExotic Locations\n\n“Unbreakable” Codes – That are broken by the protagonist.\n\nAncient Secrets\n\nHigh Action – The action is what readers come for, so it’s important to have plenty of it. From explosions and gunfights to car chases and hand-to-hand combat.\n\nThe Larger-Than-Life Threat – A city, a country, or the whole world will blow up if the protagonist fails.\n\nMilitary Exploits – Military thrillers are often found in both action/adventure and thriller genres. Often, these novels follow a small group of professional soldiers.\n\nThe Love Interest – There almost always is one, and it usually helps drive the plot.\n\nLinear Plotlines\n\nBlack-and-White Morality\n\nThe MacGuffin – An object that acts as a plot device to move the story along. The hero must find the MacGuffin(s) before the villain does in order to save the world.\n\nThe Double-Cross – A trusted ally or side character turns out to be working for the enemy.\n\nBad Guys Who Can't Aim – No matter how many shots they fire at the hero, he never gets hit.\n\nChildren's Book Tropes\n\nChildren's books aim to impart a lesson to the little readers. But there are some common tropes that work well in these shorter stories.\n\nTalking Animals\n\nThe Power of Friendship\n\nAppreciating Our Differences – Anything from race to preferences to religious differences.\n\nThe Defective Animal – A hurt or deformed animal that needs to be cared for.\n\nDealing With Adversity – Often, the protagonist fails twice and then gets it right on the third attempt.\n\nLearning a New Skill\n\nLearning About Family – Usually a new sibling.\n\nLearning to Share\n\nLoyalty\n\nDedication\n\nDealing With Anger – Or any other powerful emotion.\n\nGoing to School\n\nThe Power of Imagination\n\nThe Power of Teamwork\n\nCompassion\n\nCourage\n\nBravery\n\nHonesty\n\nGrowing Up\n\nDealing With Loss\n\nContemporary Fiction\n\nContemporary fiction stories don't fit nicely into popular fiction genres. This is largely because the tropes are often hard to identify (or nonexistent). But there are a few you'll often see in these literary fiction books.\n\nSet in the Modern Day\n\nConflict Comes from Interpersonal Relationships\n\nFamily Drama\n\nComing of Age\n\nDealing with Mental Illness, Addiction, Sexual Orientation, and/or Abuse\n\nUnresolved Endings Are Common\n\nLack of Common Plot Structure\n\nNo Otherworldly Elements\n\nA Death in the Family\n\nFantasy\n\nIf you've watched any of the Lord of the Rings movies or read any of the books, you can probably name a few common Fantasy tropes.\n\nThe Hero's Journey – A plot structure popularized by Joseph Campbell that's often used in Fantasy stories. Sometimes called a Quest.\n\nSide Quests – While on the way to accomplish their main goal, the characters get sidetracked or split up to accomplish smaller goals so they can then tackle their larger goal.\n\nMedieval-Adjacent Settling – Without all the magic, it could be Europe during the middle ages.\n\nThe Chosen One – A protagonist that's prophesied to be the savior of Earth (or whatever fictional world the story is set on).\n\nThe Evil One – A larger-than-life villain that usually has immense supernatural powers. Often a wizard, witch, or warlock.\n\nThe Mentor – An older character who helps the protagonist along on his or her journey. Sometimes a good wizard, witch, or warlock.\n\nPowerful Artifacts – Swords, talismans, staffs, rings, etc. These items are powerful, and everyone wants them.\n\nMagical Creatures\n\nEpic Storylines With Lots of Characters – This is often expected, especially in high fantasy.\n\nHigh Stakes (Good vs Evil)\n\nHeir to the Throne – The character may not want the throne or even know that he/she is the heir. But by the end of the story, they usually take their rightful place as a benevolent ruler.\n\nBest of the Best – Whether the protagonist or antagonist (or both), these characters prove themselves to be the best at whatever skills they have.\n\nUnlikely Allies – When the hero is forced to trust one of their enemies to save the day.\n\nThe Reluctant Hero – When the protagonist just wants to be left alone but is pulled into the adventure, anyway.\n\nRescued by the Cavalry – Sometimes, this is an actual army riding over the ridge. Other times, it’s an ally showing up at just the right time.\n\nThe Damsel in Distress – Not as popular these days, but still used on occasion.\n\nThe Training Sequence – Where the reluctant hero learns to fight, harness magic, use his new knowledge, or all of the above.\n\nPaying the Price – Victory doesn’t come easily for the protagonist in my fantasy stories. There’s usually a price to pay.\n\nHistorical Fiction\n\nHistorical fiction, in this case, is not primarily romance. That is, there can be a romance subplot, but it's not the main storyline. These are all pretty self-explanatory.\n\nWar – Often set During World War II\n\nSet in Colonial America\n\nCombining Real and Fictional Events\n\nIncluding Historical Figures as Characters\n\nReligious Themes\n\nSocial and Political Turmoil\n\nDual Timeline – One in the past, one in the present.\n\nTraveling Long Distances – Like moving to the West Coast during the 18th century.\n\nWhat Life Was Like – Showing the everyday life of people in historical settings.\n\nHorror\n\nHorror books come in all shapes and sizes, but there are certain tropes that readers love (or love to hate). Here are some of the biggest ones.\n\nMysterious Things Are Happening – And usually, people are dying because of them.\n\nCursed Items – From books to dolls to religious trinkets, there's often something that's cursed.\n\nMonsters – There are plenty to choose from or you can invent your own.\n\nAliens – Abductions, invasions, awakenings. It’s all rife with terror.\n\nGlowing Eyes – They usually appear in the darkness at a time of great tension.\n\nHumans Can be Evil – Not all monsters look gruesome. Some live next door.\n\nBad Things Happen at Night – Rarely in the daytime.\n\nParalyzed With Fear – When a character can’t move, speak, or scream.\n\nThe Antichrist – Bad news for the world.\n\nCults and Religious Extremists – Often trying to unleash demons or the Antichrist.\n\nBacking into Darkness – You can bet there’s something lurking there.\n\nTraumatic Past – May help the character deal with the traumatic present.\n\nMinority Character Dies First – Perhaps a good one to subvert.\n\nSevered Limbs – Usually found by other characters.\n\nLosing the Ability to Run – When a character trips at the exact wrong time.\n\nEasily Definable Characters – The mean jock, the promiscuous girl, the alcoholic cop, etc. Otherwise known as character archetypes.\n\nKarmic Retribution – In a lot of horror stories, karma is swift in taking out those who do evil.\n\nDeal With the Devil\n\nCreepy Settings – Abandoned places, graveyards, forests, etc.\n\nThe Unhappy Ending – This is one of the few genres where you could possibly get away with killing your protagonist off (if done right).\n\nThe World is Ending\n\nDefeated Monster Comes Back to Life – Right at the end of the book.\n\nLiterary\n\nAlthough a broad category encompassing books that don't fit well into other genres, there are some common tropes in Literary Fiction.\n\nFlowery Writing Matters More Than Plot – Many readers seek these books out for a certain feeling or experience related to the writing itself rather than the plot.\n\nChildhood Memories – Dealing with childhood trauma is common in literary fiction.\n\nSet in a Small Town\n\nMajor Characters Killed Off – There’s no guarantee of a happy ending in this broad genre. That means that even major characters can die.\n\nDysfunctional Family\n\nMeandering Plot – Once again, plot isn’t a major concern. Many of these books end ambiguously or abruptly.\n\nMystery\n\nA good mystery pulls the reader along, asking them to solve the case before the protagonist does. There are common tropes that most readers expect when they pick up a mystery.\n\nThe Unlikable Victim – Common in cozy mysteries, the unlikable victim is someone who was an all-around jerk. But their killer still must be brought to justice. The problem is, everyone has a motive!\n\nThe Red Herring – This is the character who we're led to believe is the killer, but it's a misdirection. This can also be a clue that points in the wrong direction.\n\nClose Quarters – Whether the setting is a train, a boat, or a mansion during a bad storm, it's common for all the suspects to be in close quarters while the detective tries to unravel the mystery.\n\nThe Alibi – Just when the protagonist thought they had the killer, an airtight alibi comes to light.\n\nOutsmarting the Criminal – When the protagonist hatches a brilliant plan to get the criminal to confess.\n\nThe Trophy – When the killer keeps evidence that turns out to be his/her undoing.\n\nThe Protagonist is a Suspect – What happens when the detective (amateur or professional) is the number one suspect? Lots of tension, that's what.\n\nRighting Past Wrongs – It's common for the protagonist to take a case that directly or indirectly relates to a previous failure. They get a second chance to right their past wrong.\n\nThe Dramatic Reveal – When a character holds back information for some reason until revealing it in the most dramatic fashion possible.\n\nA Detective with a Haunted Past\n\nConsulting a Criminal – When one criminal (usually already caught) is consulted to glean information to catch the protagonist.\n\nAmnesia – Your main character can't remember who they are or can't recall vital information pertaining to the case.\n\nTwist Ending – Many readers love a good twist ending at the end of a mystery.\n\nRomance\n\nWith so many romance subgenres, there are plenty of popular tropes to choose from. Most romance novels have several of the following tropes in them.\n\nHappy Ending – The most popular and important romance trope on the list!\n\nThe Love Triangle – Three characters, one choice, and some unavoidable hurt feelings. Love triangles make for plenty of tension.\n\nForced Proximity – Two characters who find love when they're forced to spend time together.\n\nForbidden Love – Romeo and Juliet, but without the tragic ending and made with the modern romance reader in mind.\n\nThe Enemies to Lovers Trope – The characters start out hating each other. But true love prevails. (Often combined with the Forced Proximity trope).\n\nFake Relationship – One character ropes another into posing as their partner – often to get a nagging relative off their back. But what starts out as pretend soon turns serious in this popular trope.\n\nThe Other Woman/Man – Be careful with this one. No one likes a cheater, which is why there’s often some “legitimate” reason for being unfaithful to the partner.\n\nIncapable of Love – That character who has been hurt so bad they’ve given up on love. Until . . .\n\nLove Is the Answer – It doesn’t matter what the question is.\n\nThe Pure and the Promiscuous – One character (often a female) is inexperienced in the ways of love. The other (often a male) is overly experienced. You know the rest. Perhaps a trope that’s antiquated and certainly problematic in today’s culture.\n\nLove at First Glimpse (Instalove) – The characters don’t need to get to know each other to see if they’re compatible. They fall in love without even talking. The rest of the story is usually a “will they won’t they” plotline.\n\nMarriage of Convenience – There's no love between this couple. At least, not at first. But as the two get to know each other, they soon discover the sparks.\n\nUnexpected Love Interest – While the protagonist goes on date after date with the wrong people, their friend is always there for support. Pretty soon, the main character realizes that the “friend” is the one they've loved all along.\n\nFated Mates – In the paranormal romance genre, the fated mates trope is where two soulmates (one usually a shifter) find each other and things soon get steamy.\n\nThe Misunderstanding – It’s not all sunshine and rainbows in romance stories. There needs to be a conflict that comes to a head near the end of the book. This conflict is often predicated on a simple misunderstanding. This is one trope that many romance readers feel is overused.\n\nScience Fiction\n\nScience fiction stories can take place in the not-too-distant future or a long time ago in a galaxy far away. No matter when and where the story is set, there are certain tropes that readers look for.\n\nArtificial Intelligence – Given the recent headlines, it's no surprise that this trope is still going strong. AI can be helpful or hurtful in the story, but it's a staple of many a sci-fi story.\n\nDystopian – Totalitarian governments and post-apocalyptic hellscapes make the backdrop for many dystopian stories. Often, the story involves the protagonist toppling the oppressive system.\n\nTime Travel – Enough said.\n\nSpace Travel – Humans aren't meant to live in space. It's dangerous. Lots can go wrong.\n\nAliens – Like Artificial Intelligence, Aliens can be allies, enemies, or even main characters. First Contact is a sci-fi subgenre about humanity's first contact with aliens.\n\nAlternate Dimensions/Universes – Doesn't have to be done just with superheroes. 😉\n\nNanotech – Little robots that do crazy things!\n\nImplants – Changes to human bodies that give strange abilities.\n\nPower and Technology – People want to use technology for evil, while others try to stop them and use it for good.\n\nEnd of Human Race – Unless the characters survive and procreate.\n\nThe Ticking Clock – The sun will explode or the engines will fail or the asteroid will hit at a certain time.\n\nDownloading People – When the technology exists to have one’s consciousness downloaded.\n\nBody Switching – When characters can inhabit bodies other than their own.\n\nArmy of Clones\n\nDestroying the Universe – When a malevolent being wants to kill everything.\n\nDangers of Cryo Sleep – A lot can go wrong when you sleep for decades.\n\nThriller & Suspense\n\nThriller and suspense tropes are often found in action & adventure, mystery, science fiction, and even fantasy stories.\n\nTicking Clock – There's often a race against time in thrillers that adds suspense.\n\nTroubled Protagonist – Often a character with a background in law enforcement or the military, the protagonist is flawed and deeply troubled. All he or she has is the case or the mission.\n\nThe Unreliable Narrator – Most common in psychological suspense or thrillers, the unreliable narrator often lies to the reader or tells half-truths. This can help with the next trope on the list.\n\nThe Twist Ending – A good twist ending is hard to pull off, but you can do it with a careful hand. It helps to have red herrings and an unreliable narrator.\n\nThe Insurmountable Odds – Unlike mysteries, thrillers often make no mystery as to who the villain is. The tension comes in the seemingly impossible odds the main character faces. How will they ever defeat the antagonist? Will they die in the process?\n\nHigh Stakes – At the very least, the protagonist's life is at stake. To raise the tension, put other people's lives at stake. Lots of them.\n\nExotic Locales – Not every thriller needs to be a globe-trotting adventure, but many of them are. The main character often has to go to well-known cities around the world to stop the villain.\n\nThe Cliffhanger – Much of the time at the end of a chapter, but sometimes at the end of a book.\n\nMissing Children or Spouses\n\nGaslighting – Often a theme in psychological suspense.\n\nThe Stalker\n\nThe Frame-Up – Often ties in with the protagonist being suspected of the crime.\n\nCrime in the Family – When someone close to the protagonist commits a crime.\n\nYoung Adult\n\nYoung Adult novels like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games use different genres and tropes to tell their stories. Still, there are some common tropes you'll often see in these books no matter what the genre.\n\nThe Outsider – The protagonist is often an outsider, going against the grain and preferring to do things their own way.\n\nThe First Love – Young love is a common theme in these novels. It can be a subplot or even the driving force of the novel.\n\nLove Is the Answer – It doesn’t matter what the question is.\n\nIncapable of Love – That character who has been hurt so badly they’ve given up on love. Until . . .\n\nUseless or Evil Adults – It's no surprise that books written about teenagers often portray adults as incompetent or evil. This trope may be overused and ripe for subverting the reader's expectations.\n\nThe Chosen One – A protagonist that's prophesied to be the savior of Earth (or whatever fictional world the story is set on).\n\nDark Family Secret – This trope can create tension and provide surprise.\n\nDiscovering Special Powers – If the story is of a fantasy or paranormal type, this can happen to move the plot along.\n\nThe Missing or Absent Parents – This trope is often about getting the adults out of the picture to increase tension and allow the main characters to deal with issues without the help of their parents.\n\nBetter Keywords & Categories Fast\n\nSee why over 47,000+ authors and publishing companies use and love Rocket to help them sell more books.\n\nGet Publisher Rocket Now!\n\nA Complete List of Book Tropes: Conclusion\n\nTropes themselves aren't good or bad.
