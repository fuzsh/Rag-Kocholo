Now I know this camera has not been used in\n\na long long time... atleast that's what the guy said. I went through them in the dark and set aside the ones with film.\n\nFrom the best my fingers could feel I can up with two different films. Below I made a simulation of what I feel the\n\nedges should look like. I'm wondering if anyone out there can help me to identify this film. Once I know what it is I\n\ncan decide how to go about using/processing it. Granted they haven't been tamped with before that is.\n\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/images/thpix.gif<div> </div>\n\nYou can also just shoot one and process it. Try rating it at iso 100 and process one. You can get a better idea after that.\n\nI would also pull a sheet out and look at the color of the Anti Halation backing. They are many different types and colors.\n\nIt might help narrow it down.\n\n-ian"
