        "text": "With professional, high fidelity audio recording built in you'll never have to carry around a separate sound recorder again! Blackmagic Cinema Camera features 2 mini XLR inputs with 48 volts of phantom power for connecting professional microphones such as lapel mics and booms. These mini XLR connections allow you to record 2 separate audio tracks using 2 mics, without an external mixer. The four built in mics have an extremely low noise floor and are shock and wind resistant, capturing great sound in any location. There’s also a 3.5mm audio input for connecting video camera microphones, along with a built in speaker for playback and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nDigital film cameras shoot logarithmic colorspace to preserve the dynamic range, which is great for later post production, however when these files are viewed on a monitor they can look flat and washed out. 3D LUTs solve this problem because they allow you to apply a \"look\" to the monitor so you get an idea of how the finished images will look when editing. LUTs can be applied temporarily for monitoring only, or they can be recorded into the Blackmagic RAW files for use in post production. The Blackmagic Cinema Camera 6K works with industry standard 17 and 33 point 3D LUT files, or you can work with the built in LUTs such as Extended Video, Film to Video, Film to Rec.2020 and more.\n\nThe Blackmagic Cinema Camera 6K features an innovative and high speed USB-C Expansion Port that operates at up to 5 Gb/s. USB-C is available on most new computers and even provides power. That means you can connect external accessories such as flash drives and high capacity SSDs for significantly longer recording times. Best of all, when shooting is complete you can simply move the external disk to your computer and start editing and color correction from the same disk straight away, eliminating file copying. You can also add a USB-C to Ethernet adapter to control your camera over a network via secure and easy to use REST APIs. You can even copy files off the camera via the network!\n\nProfessional cameras include professional features and you also get a timecode input, allowing shooting with more than one camera while keeping perfect sync! Simply plug in an external timecode generator such as Tentacle Sync into the 3.5 mm audio jack and the camera will automatically detect timecode and lock the internal generator. Now each camera can start and stop recording and all the shots from all cameras will have the same matched timecode. Imagine shooting a music festival with multiple roving cameras! Best of all, DaVinci Resolve will automatically find and sync the shots from all cameras so you don't need to waste time sorting through thousands of shots!\n\nIn addition to shooting video, the Blackmagic Cinema Camera 6K can also capture high resolution stills. Simply press the dedicated stills button to record 24.6 megapixel images. Still images are saved as Blackmagic RAW, so you get a very high image quality, which is perfect for making high resolution professional prints or for later editing in DaVinci Resolve. Capturing still images is great for keeping track of continuity between shots or for sharing images to get approval from clients that are not on set.\n\nThe Blackmagic Cinema Camera is designed to be used worldwide and supports 13 different languages! When setting up your camera, you can choose to work in English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese or Korean. It’s easy to switch to another language so you can share your camera with other crew when traveling to locations worldwide! When you switch languages, all on screen overlays, setup menus and monitoring information will be displayed in the selected language.\n\nIf you're positioning the camera on the end of a boom, or in another hard to reach location, you can get full control via Bluetooth from up to 30 feet away. You can download the Blackmagic Camera Control app for your iPad or use third party apps such as Bluetooth+ or tRigger on your iOS and Android devices. There’s even a free developer SDK with sample code available from the Blackmagic Design developer website, so you can create your own remote camera control and digital slate solutions! Imagine building an app that can jam sync timecode and trigger all cameras to record at the same time. The possibilities are endless!\n\nBlackmagic Cinema Camera 6K uses high capacity NP-F570 batteries. These popular batteries come in a variety of capacities and are used around the world. A locking DC power connector is used so you won't have to worry about losing power during a shoot. Plus the included AC plug pack can power the camera or charge the battery when the camera is not in use. You also get a set of international socket adapters for worldwide use. Even the USB-C expansion port can trickle charge the battery, so you can use portable battery packs, mobile phone chargers or laptops. The optional battery grip lets you add extra batteries to dramatically extend the power of the camera so you can keep shooting all day!\n\nBlackmagic Cinema Camera 6K includes a full version of DaVinci Resolve Studio, which is the same software used in Hollywood for creating high end feature films, episodic television shows, commercials and more. DaVinci Resolve features the new cut page with intelligent editing tools and innovative new features designed to help you quickly find the footage you want, edit it together and output it fast. In addition to the new cut page, you also get DaVinci’s legendary professional editing, advanced color correction, audio post and visual effects tools, all in a single software application! Now you can use the the same high end software that professional editors and colorists use!"
