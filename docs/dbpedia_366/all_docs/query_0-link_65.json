        "text": "What items qualify?\n\nLook for the How2Recycle Store Drop-off label on flexible polyethylene-based plastics, such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE, or #2 plastic) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE, or #4 plastic), including but not limited to:\n\ngrocery and produce bags\n\nbread bags\n\nplastic stretch wraps\n\nnewspaper bags\n\nplastic mailers with compatible label\n\nwraps around paper products (paper towels, diapers, etc.)\n\ncereal bags\n\nThe above lists applications where Store Drop-off recyclable flexible packaging can be found. This list does not mean all items in the categories have Store Drop-off recyclable packaging. If the item has had contact with food or another product that may leave behind residue, be sure that it is clean and dry before dropping it in the bin.\n\nWhat happens after itâ€™s collected?\n\nAfter collection, the flexible plastic is baled and sold to independent companies. Then begins the process of turning these PE films into tiny plastic pellets. These pellets can become synthetic lumber for decking or park benches, or they might be recycled directly into another film, pouch, or bag form. How2Recycle highly encourages members to source recycled content for flexible plastic items to encourage the end market of the Store Drop-off stream."
