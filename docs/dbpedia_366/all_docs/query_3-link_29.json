Using content analysis, researchers can quantify and analyze the presence, meanings, and relationships of such certain words, themes, or concepts. As an example, researchers can evaluate language used within a news article to search for bias or partiality. Researchers can then make inferences about the messages within the texts, the writer(s), the audience, and even the culture and time of surrounding the text.\n\nDescription\n\nSources of data could be from interviews, open-ended questions, field research notes, conversations, or literally any occurrence of communicative language (such as books, essays, discussions, newspaper headlines, speeches, media, historical documents). A single study may analyze various forms of text in its analysis. To analyze the text using content analysis, the text must be coded, or broken down, into manageable code categories for analysis (i.e. “codes”). Once the text is coded into code categories, the codes can then be further categorized into “code categories” to summarize data even further.\n\nThree different definitions of content analysis are provided below.\n\nDefinition 1: “Any technique for making inferences by systematically and objectively identifying special characteristics of messages.” (from Holsti, 1968)\n\nDefinition 2: “An interpretive and naturalistic approach. It is both observational and narrative in nature and relies less on the experimental elements normally associated with scientific research (reliability, validity, and generalizability) (from Ethnography, Observational Research, and Narrative Inquiry, 1994-2012).\n\nDefinition 3: “A research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication.” (from Berelson, 1952)\n\nUses of Content Analysis\n\nIdentify the intentions, focus or communication trends of an individual, group or institution\n\nDescribe attitudinal and behavioral responses to communications\n\nDetermine the psychological or emotional state of persons or groups\n\nReveal international differences in communication content\n\nReveal patterns in communication content\n\nPre-test and improve an intervention or survey prior to launch\n\nAnalyze focus group interviews and open-ended questions to complement quantitative data\n\nTypes of Content Analysis\n\nThere are two general types of content analysis: conceptual analysis and relational analysis. Conceptual analysis determines the existence and frequency of concepts in a text. Relational analysis develops the conceptual analysis further by examining the relationships among concepts in a text. Each type of analysis may lead to different results, conclusions, interpretations and meanings.\n\nConceptual Analysis\n\nTypically people think of conceptual analysis when they think of content analysis. In conceptual analysis, a concept is chosen for examination and the analysis involves quantifying and counting its presence. The main goal is to examine the occurrence of selected terms in the data. Terms may be explicit or implicit. Explicit terms are easy to identify. Coding of implicit terms is more complicated: you need to decide the level of implication and base judgments on subjectivity (an issue for reliability and validity). Therefore, coding of implicit terms involves using a dictionary or contextual translation rules or both.\n\nTo begin a conceptual content analysis, first identify the research question and choose a sample or samples for analysis. Next, the text must be coded into manageable content categories. This is basically a process of selective reduction. By reducing the text to categories, the researcher can focus on and code for specific words or patterns that inform the research question.\n\nGeneral steps for conducting a conceptual content analysis:\n\n1. Decide the level of analysis: word, word sense, phrase, sentence, themes\n\n2. Decide how many concepts to code for: develop a pre-defined or interactive set of categories or concepts. Decide either: A. to allow flexibility to add categories through the coding process, or B. to stick with the pre-defined set of categories.\n\nOption A allows for the introduction and analysis of new and important material that could have significant implications to one’s research question.\n\nOption B allows the researcher to stay focused and examine the data for specific concepts.\n\n3. Decide whether to code for existence or frequency of a concept. The decision changes the coding process.\n\nWhen coding for the existence of a concept, the researcher would count a concept only once if it appeared at least once in the data and no matter how many times it appeared.\n\nWhen coding for the frequency of a concept, the researcher would count the number of times a concept appears in a text.\n\n4. Decide on how you will distinguish among concepts:\n\nShould text be coded exactly as they appear or coded as the same when they appear in different forms? For example, “dangerous” vs. “dangerousness”. The point here is to create coding rules so that these word segments are transparently categorized in a logical fashion. The rules could make all of these word segments fall into the same category, or perhaps the rules can be formulated so that the researcher can distinguish these word segments into separate codes.\n\nWhat level of implication is to be allowed? Words that imply the concept or words that explicitly state the concept? For example, “dangerous” vs. “the person is scary” vs. “that person could cause harm to me”. These word segments may not merit separate categories, due the implicit meaning of “dangerous”.\n\n5. Develop rules for coding your texts. After decisions of steps 1-4 are complete, a researcher can begin developing rules for translation of text into codes. This will keep the coding process organized and consistent. The researcher can code for exactly what he/she wants to code. Validity of the coding process is ensured when the researcher is consistent and coherent in their codes, meaning that they follow their translation rules. In content analysis, obeying by the translation rules is equivalent to validity.\n\n6. Decide what to do with irrelevant information: should this be ignored (e.g. common English words like “the” and “and”), or used to reexamine the coding scheme in the case that it would add to the outcome of coding?\n\n7. Code the text: This can be done by hand or by using software. By using software, researchers can input categories and have coding done automatically, quickly and efficiently, by the software program. When coding is done by hand, a researcher can recognize errors far more easily (e.g. typos, misspelling). If using computer coding, text could be cleaned of errors to include all available data. This decision of hand vs. computer coding is most relevant for implicit information where category preparation is essential for accurate coding.\n\n8. Analyze your results: Draw conclusions and generalizations where possible. Determine what to do with irrelevant, unwanted, or unused text: reexamine, ignore, or reassess the coding scheme. Interpret results carefully as conceptual content analysis can only quantify the information. Typically, general trends and patterns can be identified.\n\nRelational Analysis\n\nRelational analysis begins like conceptual analysis, where a concept is chosen for examination. However, the analysis involves exploring the relationships between concepts. Individual concepts are viewed as having no inherent meaning and rather the meaning is a product of the relationships among concepts.\n\nTo begin a relational content analysis, first identify a research question and choose a sample or samples for analysis. The research question must be focused so the concept types are not open to interpretation and can be summarized. Next, select text for analysis. Select text for analysis carefully by balancing having enough information for a thorough analysis so results are not limited with having information that is too extensive so that the coding process becomes too arduous and heavy to supply meaningful and worthwhile results.\n\nThere are three subcategories of relational analysis to choose from prior to going on to the general steps.\n\nAffect extraction: an emotional evaluation of concepts explicit in a text. A challenge to this method is that emotions can vary across time, populations, and space. However, it could be effective at capturing the emotional and psychological state of the speaker or writer of the text.\n\nProximity analysis: an evaluation of the co-occurrence of explicit concepts in the text. Text is defined as a string of words called a “window” that is scanned for the co-occurrence of concepts. The result is the creation of a “concept matrix”, or a group of interrelated co-occurring concepts that would suggest an overall meaning.\n\nCognitive mapping: a visualization technique for either affect extraction or proximity analysis. Cognitive mapping attempts to create a model of the overall meaning of the text such as a graphic map that represents the relationships between concepts.\n\nGeneral steps for conducting a relational content analysis:\n\n1. Determine the type of analysis: Once the sample has been selected, the researcher needs to determine what types of relationships to examine and the level of analysis: word, word sense, phrase, sentence, themes.\n\n2. Reduce the text to categories and code for words or patterns. A researcher can code for existence of meanings or words.\n\n3. Explore the relationship between concepts: once the words are coded, the text can be analyzed for the following:\n\nStrength of relationship: degree to which two or more concepts are related.\n\nSign of relationship: are concepts positively or negatively related to each other?\n\nDirection of relationship: the types of relationship that categories exhibit. For example, “X implies Y” or “X occurs before Y” or “if X then Y” or if X is the primary motivator of Y.\n\n4. Code the relationships: a difference between conceptual and relational analysis is that the statements or relationships between concepts are coded.\n\n5. Perform statistical analyses: explore differences or look for relationships among the identified variables during coding.\n\n6. Map out representations: such as decision mapping and mental models.\n\nReliability and Validity\n\nReliability: Because of the human nature of researchers, coding errors can never be eliminated but only minimized. Generally, 80% is an acceptable margin for reliability. Three criteria comprise the reliability of a content analysis:\n\nStability: the tendency for coders to consistently re-code the same data in the same way over a period of time.\n\nReproducibility: tendency for a group of coders to classify categories membership in the same way.\n\nAccuracy: extent to which the classification of text corresponds to a standard or norm statistically.\n\nValidity: Three criteria comprise the validity of a content analysis:\n\nCloseness of categories: this can be achieved by utilizing multiple classifiers to arrive at an agreed upon definition of each specific category. Using multiple classifiers, a concept category that may be an explicit variable can be broadened to include synonyms or implicit variables.\n\nConclusions: What level of implication is allowable? Do conclusions correctly follow the data? Are results explainable by other phenomena? This becomes especially problematic when using computer software for analysis and distinguishing between synonyms. For example, the word “mine,” variously denotes a personal pronoun, an explosive device, and a deep hole in the ground from which ore is extracted. Software can obtain an accurate count of that word’s occurrence and frequency, but not be able to produce an accurate accounting of the meaning inherent in each particular usage. This problem could throw off one’s results and make any conclusion invalid.\n\nGeneralizability of the results to a theory: dependent on the clear definitions of concept categories, how they are determined and how reliable they are at measuring the idea one is seeking to measure. Generalizability parallels reliability as much of it depends on the three criteria for reliability.\n\nAdvantages of Content Analysis\n\nDirectly examines communication using text\n\nAllows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis\n\nProvides valuable historical and cultural insights over time\n\nAllows a closeness to data\n\nCoded form of the text can be statistically analyzed\n\nUnobtrusive means of analyzing interactions\n\nProvides insight into complex models of human thought and language use\n\nWhen done well, is considered a relatively “exact” research method\n\nContent analysis is a readily-understood and an inexpensive research method\n\nA more powerful tool when combined with other research methods such as interviews, observation, and use of archival records. It is very useful for analyzing historical material, especially for documenting trends over time.\n\nDisadvantages of Content Analysis\n\nCan be extremely time consuming\n\nIs subject to increased error, particularly when relational analysis is used to attain a higher level of interpretation\n\nIs often devoid of theoretical base, or attempts too liberally to draw meaningful inferences about the relationships and impacts implied in a study\n\nIs inherently reductive, particularly when dealing with complex texts\n\nTends too often to simply consist of word counts\n\nOften disregards the context that produced the text, as well as the state of things after the text is produced\n\nCan be difficult to automate or computerize\n\nReadings\n\nTextbooks & Chapters\n\nBerelson, Bernard.
