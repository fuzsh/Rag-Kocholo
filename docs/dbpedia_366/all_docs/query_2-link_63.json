Have an account? .\n\nIt's been 33 years since \"Home Alone\" debuted, but it's still beloved around the holidays.\n\nFans may not know that Macaulay Culkin improvised one of the film's most iconic moments.\n\nThe cast almost looked a little different, and Culkin's brother also made a guest appearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took weeks to find the right house for the film.\n\nIt took several weeks for the director Chris Columbus and his crew to find the McCallister house for \"Home Alone,\" according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nUltimately, they chose a house in Winnetka, Illinois, because they thought it was both warm and menacing.\n\n\"I took some pictures and sent them over to John, and I remember John saying: 'This is perfect. This is exactly how I imagined the house,'\" he told the publication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Brothers initially had the rights for the screenplay.\n\nThough the film was ultimately produced by Hughes Entertainment and presented by 20th Century Fox, Warner Brothers initially had rights to the project.\n\nAccording to Chicago magazine, a budget dispute occurred three weeks before the production of \"Home Alone\" was set to start.\n\n\"The question was, 'Do we lay everyone off?'\" the associate producer Mark Radcliffe told the publication. \"John [Hughes] said to just hold tight.\"\n\nLuckily, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to the film and production continued as planned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCulkin and his on-screen mom shared a sweet moment years later.\n\nPer Us Weekly, during a 2015 interview on \"Watch What Happens Live,\" Catherine O'Hara told Andy Cohen that she and Culkin had a sweet interaction at an art event.\n\n\"I haven't seen him for years and years, but I saw him two years ago — a year and a half ago? — at a Martin Mull art opening, and he was coming out, and he went, 'Mommy!' And I said, 'Baby!'\" she recalled.\n\nShe added that her husband made them take a picture and that she was happy to see him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film held a cinematic record for nearly 30 years.\n\nForbes reported that until 2017, \"Home Alone\" had the highest single-territory total for a live-action comedy, with $285.7 million.\n\nThe film held this impressive record for 27 years, until the Chinese film \"Never Say Die\" surpassed it in 2017 (without accounting for inflation).\n\nRegardless, \"Home Alone\" is still one of the highest-grossing live-action comedies in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCulkin's younger brother appeared in the movie.\n\nIn his first acting credit, Culkin's younger brother Kieran appeared as Kevin's cousin, Fuller, in \"Home Alone.\"\n\nThe brothers appeared together on-screen again in \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film was written in just over a week.\n\nJohn Hughes, who also wrote 1980s blockbusters like \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Pretty in Pink,\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" crafted the first draft of the screenplay for \"Home Alone\" in just nine days.\n\nAccording to the same Chicago magazine article — which was written by his son, James — the film was written after a family trip to Europe in response to his father's severe traveler's anxiety.\n\n\"I was going away on vacation,'\" Hughes told Time magazine in 1990, \"and making a list of everything I didn't want to forget. I thought, 'Well, I'd better not forget my kids.' Then I thought, 'What if I left my 10-year-old son at home? What would he do?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCulkin has said he has trouble watching the film.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Culkin said he couldn't watch \"Home Alone\" without remembering a bunch of personal context.\n\n\"When I'm watching it, I'm seeing like — I'm remembering that day on set. You know, like, how I was hiding my Pepsi behind the couch,\" he said. \"I can't watch it the same way other people can.\"\n\nIn the same interview, he referred to the film as \"background radiation at Christmastime.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColumbus was supposed to direct a different Hughes-written Christmas classic.\n\nAccording to Chicago magazine, Columbus was originally working on \"Christmas Vacation\" — which was also written by Hughes — but he eventually called the writer to tell him he couldn't work with the actor Chevy Chase.\n\n\"John was very understanding. About two weeks later, I got two scripts at my in-laws' house in River Forest. One was 'Home Alone,' with a note from John asking if I wanted to direct,\" he told the publication. \"I thought, 'Wow, this guy is really supporting me when no one else in Hollywood was going to.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Candy improvised most of his scenes in \"Home Alone.\"\n\nColumbus told Insider's Jason Guerrasio in 2020 that the legendary comedic actor John Candy came on set ready to improvise.\n\n\"He was on the movie for only one day, but it resulted in so much great improvisation. None of that stuff was in the script,\" he said. \"The funeral-parlor story, that was all improvised at 4:30 in the morning. We could barely keep a straight face on set just listening to John.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHughes was particular about his script, but Columbus added one of the film's most touching moments.\n\nBeyond Candy's cameo, Hughes didn't allow for a ton of improvisation or tweaks to his script, but Columbus had a sweet vision for the character of Old Man Marley that he was able to sneak into the film.\n\nThough the scene in the church was always in the script, the director added to the conversation between Kevin and Marley.\n\n\"I added the moment when Marley talked about not being able to see his granddaughter. I also added the very end of the movie when Kevin sees that Marley is reunited with his granddaughter,\" Columbus told Insider. \"That is probably my proudest addition to the movie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert De Niro was considered for the role of Harry.\n\nBefore Joe Pesci took on the role of Harry in \"Home Alone,\" the production team had its eyes on Robert De Niro.\n\nBut according to Columbus, the actor never seriously considered taking the role.\n\n\"It was talked about a little internally, but when Pesci said yes, I was stunned,\" he told Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCulkin improvised one of the most iconic \"Home Alone\" moments.\n\nKevin's reaction to putting on aftershave is arguably one of the best-known scenes of the film — and it's since become one of the most iconic moments in movie history.\n\nBut Culkin apparently didn't do it the way Columbus told him to.\n\n\"If you put something on your face that burns, most people move their hands right away. So my direction to him was when you pat your face, move your hands and scream. And I think it was the first take, he kept his hands on his cheeks,\" the director told Insider.\n\nHe added, \"It's funny, the iconic moment from 'Home Alone' was an accident.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BB-gun effect was achieved with animation.\n\nWhen \"Home Alone\" came out in 1990, CGI wasn't the norm on film sets. And since the movie was already working on a tight budget, the production team had to get creative when it came to special effects.\n\nDuring the scene in which Kevin shoots Marv in the head with a BB gun, the pellet was actually animated.\n\n\"We paid a guy living in his mother's basement in Chicago $600 to hand-paint that BB going into Marv's head. So that was an animated effect. A guy with a paintbrush in a basement for six frames hand-painted a BB,\" Columbus told Insider.\n\nHe continued: \"This was an $18 million film, so, for our budget, I'm pretty happy how it turned out.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film has fooled many people into believing \"Angels With Filthy Souls\" is real.\n\nKevin uses a black-and-white movie called \"Angels With Filthy Souls\" to aid in his defense plan against the Wet Bandits, and many people — including Seth Rogen and Chris Evans — were shocked when they learned it wasn't a real film.\n\nThe scene was created specifically for \"Home Alone,\" but there's a reason it looks so real.\n\n\"'Home Alone' is one of the last films shot with an old carbon-arc lighting system that was popular back in the 1940s through 1960s for Technicolor films,\" Columbus told Insider.\n\nHe explained that they used the same technique for \"Angels With Filthy Souls.\"\n\n\"That richness of black and white made it look like a movie from that era, and I think that's why some people think it's a real movie,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Home Alone\" was written with Culkin in mind after another Hughes hit.\n\nA year before \"Home Alone,\" Culkin starred alongside Candy in Hughes' \"Uncle Buck.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Home Alone\" episode of Netflix's \"The Movies That Made Us,\" after watching the actor play Miles Russell, Hughes was inspired to write a film with a young boy at its helm.\n\nOnce the idea started taking shape, he thought Culkin would be great in the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProduction of the film took place at a familiar high school in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\nOn the same episode of \"The Movies That Made Us,\" the production team shared stories about working at New Trier Township High School in Winnetka, Illinois.\n\nHughes liked to make his movies in the Chicagoland area, so they set up their production offices in the same building where some of his other classics, such as \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"Uncle Buck,\" were shot.\n\nThey also ended up building the interior sets for the McCallisters' house in the school's gym, and they inventively built the set for the Murphys' house — which floods at the end of the film — in the swimming pool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCandy reportedly made less than the pizza boy for his cameo in \"Home Alone.\"\n\nCandy filmed all his scenes during one 23-hour day on set, but he didn't get much in return as far as compensation.\n\nAccording to the episode of \"The Movies That Made Us,\" the actor did the cameo as a favor to Hughes, and he received \"scale\" pay — the minimum pay rate that a studio agrees to.\n\nIn the end, Candy ended up making less than Danny Warhol (aka Dan Charles Zukoski), who played the pizza boy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stunts were real — and one was even named in honor of \"Home Alone.\"\n\nThough Culkin, Pesci, and Daniel Stern weren't responsible for all of the falls and hits their characters took throughout the film, their stunt doubles did them for real.\n\nThey didn't use any special-effect tricks, and there weren't any pads built into the ground, according to the episode of \"The Movies That Made Us,\" so the film crew was under a lot of pressure to get the shots right on the first take.\n\nPesci's stunt double for the film, Troy Brown, said on the docuseries that for his first fall on the icy stairs, he \"just launched myself as far and as high as I could.\"\n\nThe film's wild stunts had a long-lasting impact.\n\n\"Now when someone does a fall where they get a lot of air, and they fall on their back, they'd call it the 'Home Alone,'\" the director of photography Julio Macat said on the episode.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColumbus went on to direct another Christmas hit.\n\n\"Home Alone\" was only the third feature-length film that Columbus directed, but he's since gone on to direct popular movies like \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" and \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\"\n\nIn addition to taking on some fantasy classics, Columbus directed Netflix's \"The Christmas Chronicles 2\" (2020), marking his return to holiday films.\n\nAn earlier version of this story was published in November 2018, and it was most recently updated on December 19, 2023.\n\nRead More:\n\nRead next\n\nChristmas Holidays Movie\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
