        "text": "As long as there have been films, there have been film critics. Starting with the early days of cinema, where reviews appeared in newspapers and magazines as brief, descriptive pieces, as filmmaking evolved as an art form, so did the role of the critic. James Agee, Andr√© Bazin, and Pauline Kael shaped the discourse around cinema, and today, famous film critics like the iconic Roger Ebert, The New York Times‚Äôs A.O. Scott, and The New York Times‚Äôs Manohla Dargis continue to leave an indelible mark on the world of cinema.\n\nWith the rise of the internet, film criticism now encompasses a wide range of voices and perspectives from around the globe. Sites like Letterboxd make it possible for anyone to write short-form reviews on film. Even stars like The Bear‚Äôs Ayo Edebiri have accounts and share opinions on the latest box-office hits.\n\nHow to Write a Movie Review\n\nToday, contemporary YouTube and TikTok critics such as Red Letter Media, deepfocuslens, and DoMo Draper don‚Äôt just write film reviews, they shoot videos and skits. Through their creative formats, they offer refreshing and unique perspectives while building communities of diehard film and television enthusiasts. Whether you choose to write reviews for your own blog, other websites, or social media channels, by learning how to write a movie review, any aspiring filmmaker can start to watch films intentionally.\n\n@domodraperr\n\nReplying to @xsindeviltriggerx I‚Äôll get right on that, Sir!ü´° #comments #movies #film #satire #fyp #mulan #disney\n\n‚ô¨ I‚Äôll Make a Man Out of You (feat. Black Gryph0n) ‚Äì Cover ‚Äì Samuel Kim\n\nTikTok film critic ‚ÄúDoMo Draper‚Äù provides commentary on new and old films, often calling out racism, social injustice, misogyny, and prejudice.\n\nWhile there‚Äôs no perfect approach to writing a review, there are best practices that every aspiring reviewer should consider.\n\nHere are ten tips on writing a compelling piece.\n\n1. Watch the film at least once.\n\nFor new reviewers, it‚Äôs impossible to capture everything after one viewing. Watching the film first, then watching to take notes, is an easy way to improve the quality of your final review. This will also make it easy to recall in-the-moment thoughts and reactions.\n\nTake a review by Christian Blauvelt of Charlie Chaplin‚Äôs silent film The Circus, for example. Since the film does not have sound, properly critiquing the film requires close attention. Viewers have to pay attention to the various nuances in Chaplin‚Äôs performance, follow the story, and take in the cinematography. Regarding The Circus, Blauvelt writes, ‚ÄúThe film lacks a conventional plot, but is rather a pearl necklace of strung-together episodes.‚Äù The statement isn‚Äôt a criticism, but a keen observation likely gleaned from more than one viewing.\n\nSo while every film reviewer has their own approach, many choose to watch a film more than once to deliver the best possible review.

Express your opinions and support your criticism.\n\nProfessional reviewers do not shy away from sharing whether they thought a movie was good, bad, or indifferent. In a review for the film Mother!, reviewer Candice Frederick describes the film as ‚Äúuncomfortable,‚Äù and ‚Äúcontroversial,‚Äù helping viewers understand the tone of the movie. While Frederick seemed to enjoy the film, her honesty about how it would make audiences feel was vital in writing the review.\n\nBe sure to back up these thoughts with specifics‚Äìa disappointing performance, beautiful cinematography, difficult material that leaves you thinking, and so on. Professional reviewers should express why and how they came to their criticism.\n\n3. Consider your audience.\n\nAre you writing for a fan site or a news outlet? Who will read your pieces, and what are their interests? Knowing who your readers are and where the review will be published can help you decide what elements of the movie to highlight. For example, take these two very different reviews for the film ‚ÄòSynecdoche, New York‚Äô.\n\nThe first review was written by Alonso Duralde for The Today Show, and clocks in at around 500 words. The film focuses on the bullet points: characters, plot, and a concise review. The second review is over 3,000 words and published on the Critical Critics blog. This review goes into massive depth (and yes, includes spoilers) about the film, providing an incredible amount of analysis. The first review is tailored for the casual filmgoer, while the second is for cinephiles. Each review serves a different purpose.\n\nIt‚Äôs also a good idea to adjust your writing style to fit the target audience. For example, Alonso Duralde is a talented film reviewer and likely wrote the review to fit the tone of The Today Show site. Image via Director‚Äôs Library.\n\n4. Talk about the acting.\n\nWhen reviewing a film, it‚Äôs important to take space to discuss the performances. Does the film feature a seasoned actor in a new kind of role or a brilliant performance from a rising star? How was the acting? In a review by Brett Milam for the award-winning film Whiplash, he goes into rich detail about performances by both breakthrough actor Miles Teller and seasoned professional JK Simmons.\n\nRegarding Teller, Milam writes, ‚ÄúThis is a performance. This is art,‚Äù and about Simmons, ‚ÄúI found him fascinating to just look at.‚Äù Those are just small examples of the analysis he provides regarding their acting. As the film mostly focuses on the relationship between their two characters, Miles as the protagonist and JK as the antagonist, the review of the performances lends well to the plot of the film: student and teacher going head to head in an intense and determined showdown.\n\nFeedback about how well the actors handled the script, the dynamics in an ensemble, and so much more can help describe how the actors did in any given film.\n\n5. Call out directors, cinematographers, and special effects.\n\nReviews that include highlights or missteps of directors, cinematographers, and costume designers can help provide support to your critiques. By providing specific examples of what worked, what surprised you, and what fell short of expectations, reviewers can write a well-thought-out review that goes beyond whether or not you liked it.\n\nIn a review for A Wrinkle in Time, Monique Jones artfully crafts a piece that diplomatically cites the missteps of the film. From analyzing the quality of the CGI to the camera techniques to inconsistencies in the rules of the fantasy universe, Jones fairly offers a critique that guides the filmmakers and crew on future endeavors. To write this type of review, it helps to have some knowledge of the filmmaking process so you can properly assess the screenwriting, cinematography, special effects, acting, and more.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs absolutely best practice to not reveal spoilers in a film review. Film reviewer Robert Daniels approaches this creatively. In his review of Annihilation, he provides commentary on what would be considered spoilers. However, he places that part of the review at the bottom of the article under a bold header/image that warns the reader he‚Äôs about to spoil the film. For reviewers who want to dissect the entire film, this is a good way to both tease the film for anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen it and cater to people who want to know what the ending is.\n\nRemember: the goal of any film review is to discuss the plot without revealing any twists or the ending of the film.\n\n7. Study the professionals.\n\nAs with all writing endeavors, the more you read, the better. However, with the modern landscape of film reviewing, which can go beyond writing and extend to content creation for social media platforms, there are a ton of reviewers to take notes from. First, determine what kind of reviewer you want to be, and what kind of medium you plan to deliver your reviews on. If you plan to post to Medium, for example, studying the reviewers already established on the site can be a great starting point.\n\nThen, read film reviews for some of your favorite films. Determine which style of review you like and don‚Äôt like. Question why, and use your critical eye to consider why one reviewer has a hundred thousand followers and another only has two. If you‚Äôre looking to be featured on a website or a magazine, read the publications where you‚Äôd like your writing to appear as a template for your reviews, and don‚Äôt forget to read the submission guidelines. A few examples of film review professionals include Rotten Tomatoes, Roger Ebert, and Film Comment.\n\n8. Reread, rewrite, and edit.\n\nWhile writing film critique is based on opinion, and follows the style of the reviewer, it‚Äôs still important to edit work. Writers should check for spelling, grammar, and readability. No matter how good a writer‚Äôs opinions are, they will not be taken seriously if the director‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt spelled correctly. Tools such as Grammarly and Hemingway Editor can be great for correcting and finding areas that need improvement.\n\n9. Find your voice.\n\nThe best reviewers have a distinct personality that comes across in their writing. Los Angeles Times film reviewer Carlos Aguilar wrote an impassioned piece about the film Beatriz at Dinner, going into a lot of detail about his experiences working in the film industry and his Mexican heritage. By sharing anecdotes about casual racism he‚Äôs experienced and connecting it to the film‚Äôs protagonist, and what she goes through, the review feels personal and relatable.\n\n‚ÄúIf at a film festival ‚Äì to which I‚Äôve gotten access to because I‚Äôm a published writer ‚Äì in a progressive city like Los Angeles, I must keep my guard up when people question my right to be there, then how are the voiceless supposed to feel safe, respected, or hopeful?‚Äù Aguilar writes.\n\nFor new reviewers, developing this type of unique voice does not happen overnight, so take every opportunity to write as an opportunity to develop your style.

By knowing specific preferences, strengths, and biases, reviewers can offer nuanced critiques that resonate with audiences and provide valuable guidance on which films they might enjoy. Additionally, it helps to maintain credibility and integrity as a reviewer by ensuring that assessments are authentic and reflective of personal cinematic sensibilities.\n\nTry to explore various genres, directors, and themes to understand what resonates emotionally, intellectually, and aesthetically. Pay attention to the types of stories that engage you, which can help define your preferences.\n\nLearn More About Filmmaking at NYFA"
