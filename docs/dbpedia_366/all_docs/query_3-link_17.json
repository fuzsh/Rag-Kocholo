        "text": "As a result, researchers analyze qualitative data for identifying themes or phenomena that occur often or in telling patterns. In the case of TV shows, a collection of reviews of TV shows may frequently mention the acting, the script writing, and the production values, among other things. If these aspects are mentioned the most often, researchers can think of these as the themes determining the quality of a given TV show.\n\nA useful metaphor for thematic analysis\n\nEven if this is an easy concept to grasp, realizing this concept in qualitative research is a significant challenge. The biggest consideration for thematic analysis is that qualitative data is often unstructured and requires some organization to make it relevant to researchers and their audience.\n\nImagine that you have a bag of marbles. Each marble has one of a set of different colors. If you were to sort the marbles by color, you could determine how many colors are in the bag and which colors are the most common.\n\nA simple example of thematic analysis\n\nImagine a simple research question: how do teachers determine if a student's essay is good? Suppose you have a set of transcripts of interviews with teachers discussing writing classes and students' essays. In this case, the objective of thematic analysis is to determine the main factors teachers use to determine the quality of a piece of writing.\n\nAs you read the transcripts, you might find that teachers share some common answers. Of course, you might have an intuition that correct grammar and spelling are important, which will likely be confirmed by the teachers in their interviews. However, other considerations might surface in the data.\n\nThe next question in this casual thematic analysis is, what considerations appear most often? A few teachers may occasionally mention the size and typeface of the text as deciding factors, but more often they might say that the flow and organization of students' writing are more important. Analyzing the occurrences and patterns among themes across your transcripts can help you develop an answer to your research question.\n\nThe subjectivity of themes\n\nOne challenge is that themes in qualitative analysis, as with determining the themes of good writing, are not as visible to the naked eye as colors on a marble. The color \"red\" is relatively easy to see, but the fields in which thematic analysis is often applied do not deal with concepts that can necessarily be seen \"objectively.\" It is up to the researcher to derive themes from the data from an inductive approach. Researchers can also utilize deductive approaches if they want to analyze their data according to themes that have been previously identified in other research.\n\nThink about the picture up above. To the naked eye, these children are holding hands. But themes that can be interpreted from this picture may include \"friendship,\" \"happiness,\" or even \"family.\" The thematic analysis of pictures like this one often depends on a researcher's theoretical commitments, knowledge base, and cultural perspective.\n\nThis also means that you are responsible for explaining how you arrived at the themes arising from your data set. While colors are intuitively easy to distinguish, you are often required to explain more subjective codes and themes like \"resilience\" or \"entitlement\" so that you and your research audience have a common understanding of your data analysis.\n\nThis explanation should account for who you are as a researcher and how you see the data (since, after all, a word like \"resilience\" can mean different things to different people). A fully reflexive thematic analysis documents and presents where the researcher is relative to their data and to their research audience.\n\nThe thematic analysis process\n\nVirginia Braun and Victoria Clarke are the key researchers involved in making thematic analysis a commonly utilized approach in qualitative research. A quick search for their scholarship will tell you the basic steps involved in thematic analysis:\n\nBecome familiar with the data\n\nGenerate codes from the data\n\nGenerate themes based on the codes\n\nReview the potential themes\n\nDefine the themes for the final reporting\n\nIn a nutshell, thematic analysis requires the researcher to look at their data, summarize their data with codes, and develop those codes to the extent that they can contribute a broader understanding of the context from which the data is collected.\n\nWhile these are the key points in a robust and rigorous thematic analysis, there are understated parts of the qualitative research process that can often be taken for granted but must never be overlooked to ensure that researchers can analyze their data quickly and with as few challenges as possible.\n\nThe process in greater detail\n\nThematic analysis relies on research questions that are exploratory in nature, thus requiring an inductive approach to examining the data. While you might rely on an existing theoretical framework to decide your research questions and collect all the data for your project, thematic analysis primarily looks at your data inductively for what it says and what it says most often.\n\nAfter data collection, you need to organize the data in some way to make the data analysis process easier (or, at minimum, possible). A data set in qualitative research is often akin to a crowd of people where individuals move in any direction without any sense of organization. This is a challenge if your research question involves understanding the crowd's age, gender, ethnicity, or style of clothing.\n\nThematic analysis in other research methods\n\nEspecially in qualitative research, discrete analytical approaches overlap with each other, meaning that a sufficiently thorough analysis of your data can eventually yield themes useful to your research. Let's examine a few of the more prominent approaches in qualitative research and their relation to thematic analysis.\n\nGrounded theory\n\nUsing grounded theory involves developing analysis iteratively through an inductive approach. While there is a great deal of overlap with thematic analysis approaches, grounded theory relies on incorporating more data to support the analysis in previous iterations of the research.\n\nNonetheless, the analytic process is largely the same for both approaches as they rely on seeking out phenomena that occur in abundance or distinct patterns. As you analyze qualitative data in either orientation, your main consideration is to observe which patterns emerge that can help contribute to a more universal understanding of the population or phenomenon under observation.\n\nNarrative analysis\n\nUnderstanding narratives is often less about taking large samples of data and more about unpacking the meaning that is produced in the data that is collected. In narrative research analysis, the data set is merely the narrative to be examined for its meaning, intent, and effect on its audience.\n\nSearching for abundant or patterned themes is still a common objective when examining narratives. However, specific questions guide a narrative analysis, such as what the narrator is trying to say, how they say it, and how their audience receives the narrator's message.\n\nDiscourse analysis\n\nAnalyzing discourse is similar to analyzing narratives in that there is an examination of the subtext informing the use of words in communication. Research questions under both of these approaches focus specifically on language and communication, while thematic analysis can apply to all forms of data.\n\nThe scope of analysis is also different among approaches. Thematic analysis seeks to identify patterns in abundance. In contrast, discourse analysis can look at individual instances in discursive practices to more fully understand why people use language in a particular way.\n\nHowever, the data resulting from an analysis of discursive practices can also be examined thematically. Discursive patterns within culturally-defined groups and cultural practices can be determined with a thematic analysis when utterances or interactional turns and patterns among them can be identified.\n\nContent analysis\n\nAmong all the approaches in this section, content analysis is arguably the most quantitative. Strictly speaking, the words or phrases that appear most often in a body of textual data can tell something useful about the data as a whole. For example, imagine how we feel when a public speaker says \"um\" or \"uh\" an excessive number of times compared to another speaker who doesn't use these utterances at all. In another case, what can we say about the confidence of a person who frequently writes, \"I don't know, but...\"?\n\nContent analysis seeks to determine the frequencies of aspects of language to understand a body of data. Unlike discourse analysis, however, content analysis looks strictly at what is said or written, with analysis primarily stemming from a statistical understanding of the data.\n\nOftentimes, content analysis is deductive in that it might apply previous theory to new data, unlike thematic analysis, which is primarily inductive in nature. That said, the findings from a content analysis can be used to determine themes, particularly if your research question can be addressed by directly looking at the textual data.\n\nThe codes and quotations appear in the margin next to a document in ATLAS.ti. This visualization is useful in showing how much of your data is coded and what concise meaning can be inferred from the data. In terms of thematic analysis, however, the codes can be assigned different colors based on what the researcher perceives as categories emerging from their project, as seen in the example above.\n\nAs you code the data iteratively, reviewing themes as they emerge, you can organize discrete codes within larger categories. ATLAS.ti provides spaces in your project called code groups and code categories where sets of codes in tandem represent broader, more theoretically developed themes. This approach to data organization, rather than merging codes together as broader units, allows for a more particular analysis of individual codes as your research questions evolve and develop over the course of your project.\n\nATLAS.ti tools for thematic analysis\n\nAs discussed above, analyzing qualitative data for themes can often be a matter of determining which codes and which categories of codes appear across the data and patterns among them. Indeed, any analysis software can assist you with this coding process for thematic analysis. The tools in ATLAS.ti, however, can help to make the process easier and more insightful. Let's look at a few of the many important features that are invaluable to conducting thematic analysis.\n\nCode Manager\n\nThe Code Manager is ATLAS.ti's central space where researchers can organize and analyze their codes independent of the raw data. Researchers can perform numerous tasks in the Code Manager depending on their research questions and objectives, including looking just at the data that is associated with a particular code, organizing codes into hierarchies through code categories and nested sub-codes, and determining the frequencies and level of theoretical development for each code.\n\nThe Co-Occurrence Analysis tool helps researchers determine co-occurrence between different codes by placing them in a table, a bar chart, a Sankey diagram, or a force-directed graph. These visualizations can illustrate the strength of relationships between codes to you and your research audience. The relationships themselves can also be useful in generating themes useful for your analysis.\n\nWord Frequencies\n\nQualitative content analysis depends on the frequencies of words, phrases, and other important aspects found in textual data. These frequencies can also help you in generating themes, particularly if your research questions are focused on the textual data itself.\n\nThe Word Frequencies tool in ATLAS.ti can facilitate a content analysis leading to a thematic analysis by giving you statistical data about what words appear most often in your project. Suppose these words can contribute to the development of themes. In that case, you can click on these words to find relevant quotations that you can code for thematic analysis. In addition, you can use ATLAS.ti’s Text Search tool to search for data segments that contain your word(s) of interest and automatically code them.\n\nConsiderations for thematic analysis\n\nIn qualitative research, thematic analysis is a useful means for generating a theoretical framework for qualitative concepts and phenomena. As always, though, theoretical development is best supported by thorough research. A theory that emerges from thematic analysis can be affirmed by additional inquiries, whether through a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study.\n\nFurther research is always recommended for qualitative research, such as those that employ a thematic analysis, for the very reason that themes in qualitative concepts are socially constructed by the researcher. In turn, future research building on thematic analysis depends on a research design that is transparent and clearly defined so that other researchers can understand how the themes were generated in the first place. This requires a detailed accounting of the data and the analysis through comprehensive detail and visualizations in the final report.\n\nTo that end, ATLAS.ti's various tools are specifically designed to allow researchers to share and report their data to their research audiences through data reports and visualizations. Especially where qualitative research and thematic analysis are involved, researchers can benefit from transparently showing their analysis through data excerpts, visualizations, and descriptions of their methodology."
