        "text": "Under the Films Act, IMDA is responsible for classifying films meant for distribution and public exhibition. The classification is based on content standards and guidelines drawn up in consultation with the community and industry. Such guidelines and regulations by IMDA seek to reflect the social norms and values of Singapore’s multi-racial society.\n\nOver the years, Singapore has moved away from censorship to classification. With only three ratings when the classification system was first introduced in 1991, it has since expanded to six in 2011, with consumer advisories where necessary. Classification allows films to be suitably rated for different audiences in Singapore so the public can have greater access to a wider range of media choices without compromising on the need to protect young children from undesirable content. IMDA is assisted by the Films Consultative Panel in its evaluation of films.\n\nBy adhering to IMDA regulations and content standards, filmmakers can ensure that their films receive appropriate movie ratings for different audiences in Singapore.\n\nConsumer advice is provided to help the public make informed choices. These are descriptors that highlight the key content concerns found in a film, such as violence, nudity and sexual scenes. Consumer advice and ratings (where available) should be affixed on the video packaging, and displayed at the ticketing platforms and on a film's publicity materials.\n\nConsumer advice will be issued to selected PG films and all films rated PG13 and above.\n\nEvolution of the Film Classification Rating System\n\nFilm classification was introduced in July 1991 with three ratings to indicate the suitability of the content for viewers of different age groups – G (General), PG (Parental Guidance) and R18 (Restricted to 18 years and above).\n\nVarious improvements were made to the system over the years. The R18 rating was changed to Restricted (Artistic) in September 1991. In 1993, a new rating – NC16 (No Children under 16) was introduced to protect children from viewing films thematically unsuitable for them, and to bridge the gap between PG and R21. In 2004, the M18 rating was added to provide more choices for young adults. A PG13 rating was later added in 2011, on the recommendation of the Censorship Review Committee. G, PG and PG13 are advisory ratings and are not age restrictive. This means parents can exercise their discretion as to whether they would want their young children to watch these films.\n\nToday, the multi-tier system provides a clear indication to adult viewers and parents on the suitability of a film or video so that a more informed choice can be made.\n\nFor details on the content standards, please refer to the Film Classification Guidelines.\n\nSimultaneous Rating System (SRS)\n\nThe Simultaneous Rating System allows different versions of a film to be screened concurrently at the discretion of the film distributor to cater to different audience segments. The intent is to enable consumers to choose upfront the version of the film they would prefer to watch.\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nTo ensure that the audiences watch the appropriately-rated films, film distributors have to work with cinema exhibitors to help consumers make an informed choice. The availability of the different versions of the film must be made known in all publicity materials and at point of sales. These should be extended to all marketing and sales platforms used by cinema exhibitors, including online and mobile ticketing portals.\n\nCinema exhibitors have the option of introducing additional measures such as programming different versions of the film at different cineplex locations.\n\nFind out more information on Submission Guidelines for Simultaneous Rating System here."
