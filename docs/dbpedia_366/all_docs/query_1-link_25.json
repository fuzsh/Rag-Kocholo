        "text": "A plethora of books/booklets have come out in response to Brown’s work of pseudo-fiction (I say that because he has come to believe his own fiction, and clearly the book is intended to communicate an underlying matrix of “facts” even while presenting them in an allegedly fictional milieu)...\n\n[www.aomin.org]\n\nI read Dan Brown's claim of fiction as a double negative. The first negative is the \"fact\" page which has very little basis in fact. The second negative is the claim that Dan Brown intended to write fiction. He has said on an ABC interview that if he had written the book as non-fiction he would have changed none of the details of the conspiracy and historical interpretation.\n\nThis makes it hard to classify the genre of DaCode, but I propose we create a new genre for DaCode and its ilk: pseudo-fiction. A pseudo-fiction is \"false-false.\" It is false fiction; which means, according to the rule of double negative, it is non-fiction. Note that I did not say it was true or fact. We have no such category when it comes to literature, unless you include reference materials. However, reference materials and non-fiction works are subject to scrutiny.\n\nThe point of proposing the \"pseudo-fiction\" genre is to get around the claim of Brown and others that DaCode is \"just fiction.\" It isn't fair to simply claim that something is fiction when it pretends to be more.\n\nwrittenwithoutink.blogspot.ca\n\nThe non-fiction novel is a literary genre which, broadly speaking, depicts real historical figures and actual events woven together with fictitious conversations and uses the storytelling techniques of fiction\n\n...\n\nThe genre goes back at least as far as André Breton's Nadja (1928) and several books by the Czech writer Vítězslav Nezval, such as Ulice Git-le-coeur (1936). One of the early English books in the genre is Rebecca West's Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941).1 Jim Bishop's The Glass Crutch (1945) was advertised as \"one of the most unusual best-sellers ever published—a non-fiction novel.\"2 Perhaps the most influential nonfiction novel of the twentieth century was John Hersey's Hiroshima (1946).[3] Scholar David Schmid writes that \"many American writers during the post-World War II period, including Joan Didion, Truman Capote, and Norman Mailer, [chose] to follow Hersey’s lead.\""
