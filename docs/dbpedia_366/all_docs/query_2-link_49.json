        "text": "These ratings equip parents with comprehensive and easy to digest resources. In addition to letter ratings, CARA provides brief descriptions of the specifics behind a movie’s rating. These descriptors apply to every movie rated PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. (Movies rated G do not carry descriptors as the content presented in them is suitable for all audiences). Moreover, modifiers and unique language applied to each descriptor are intended to give an even more complete picture about what parents can expect their children to see when they go to a particular movie.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure our rating system reflects the current sentiment of parents, CARA’s system is constantly evolving. As American parents’ sensitivities change, so too does the rating system. Elements such as violence, language, drug use, and sexuality are continually re-evaluated through surveys and focus groups to mirror contemporary concern and to better assist parents in making the right family viewing choices.\n\nThe introduction of the PG-13 rating in 1984 expanded the scope of the rating system. Not intended to be tied to any specific age, the rating is a stronger note of caution suggesting to parents to further investigate the content of the motion picture before allowing their children to see it.\n\nThrough these changes, our mission remains the same: to inform parents about the content of the many great movies released every year. In doing so, we hope to provide parents with a useful social service, while allowing filmmakers to connect meaningfully with appropriate audiences."
