        "text": "Overview\n\nLiterary non-fiction is a broad term describing a range of writing genres, all of which have two simple things in common: they are written in prose (as opposed to poetry) and they deal with non-fictional subject matter (as opposed to novels or short stories). In a sense, literary non-fiction is the documentary film of the literary world, as with documentaries, literary non-fiction essays and books represent a vast range of styles and subject matter. WRIT 290 offers students an opportunity to study and write works of literary non-fiction. Through readings, exercises, forum discussions, and writing assignments, students will develop a greater sense of how literary non-fiction can work as a creative form of writing. The course will culminate in the publication of an e-book containing students' final literary non-fiction writing assignments, which will be distributed to students via Dr. May's class website.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nIn WRIT 290, students will\n\nlearn about creative non-fiction as a literary genre (stylistic and mechanical aspects);\n\nread works by recent writers working in a variety of fields (travel writing, biography, the personal essay, etc.);\n\nexperiment with creative non-fiction as a mode of writing.\n\nThrough these experiences, students will\n\nenhance their critical reading skills through readings and discussion of course texts;\n\ndevelop their writing skills by creating strong, organized, and original works of creative non-fiction to a publishable standard, and by participating in dialogue with markers, instructors, and other students on course\n\nreadings and their own work through feedback and online discussions;\n\nlearn to critique and edit their own work as well as that of others; and\n\nsee their final work published in an e-book anthology at the end of the course.\n\nTopics\n\nThe course is divided into 12 units, each of which examines a different aspect of writing creative non-fiction:\n\nUnit 1: What Is Creative Non-Fiction?\n\nUnit 2: The Truthfulness of Creative Non-Fiction\n\nUnit 3: Ten Writing Recommendations\n\nUnit 4: Types of Creative Non-Fiction\n\nUnit 5: Research and Immersion\n\nUnit 6: Narrative and Narrators\n\nUnit 7: Reading and Readers\n\nUnit 8: Scenes\n\nUnit 9: Information\n\nUnit 10: Recreation and Reconstruction\n\nUnit 11: Hook, Frame, and Focus\n\nUnit 12: Revising Creative Non-Fiction"
