        "text": "The coolest movie titles ever\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio – What makes a movie title cool?\n\nIt’s largely a matter of opinion, but some titles are remembered long after the movie leaves theaters thanks to the way they roll off the tongue and stand out among all the other titles.\n\nTo make this list, a movie title has to be memorable, unique, and sound, well, really cool!\n\nHere’s the definitive list:\n\nBy Patrick Cooley\n\nCleveland.com\n\n50. Snakes on a Plane\n\nTruly terrifying thought but oh so cool as a movie title.\n\n49. Three Days of the Condor\n\nThat title has awesome espionage flick written all over it.\n\n48. Kill Bill\n\n“I’m gonna kill Bill.” Love it.\n\n47. They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\n\nOf course they do.\n\n46. The Place Beyond the Pines\n\nKinda makes you want to take a walk in the woods.\n\n45. Bang the Drum Slowly\n\nReminds me of our favorite percussionist John Adams. And it’s a baseball movie.\n\n44. Good Will Hunting\n\nMind bender. Most hunters don’t have much good will for their prey.\n\n43. Shawshank Redemption\n\nCool title. Even better movie.\n\n42. Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\n\nOK, makes me want to know what happens to Senor Garcia.\n\n41. The Longest Day\n\nWith this title, the movie could be about going to war, going to get a colonoscopy or going to a Browns game.\n\n40. Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\n\nAdmit it. You didn’t see this movie but now you want to.\n\n39. A Clockwork Orange\n\nJust weird, but in a fascinating way.\n\n38. The Man Who Fell to Earth\n\nIt’s raining men.\n\n37. Whale Rider\n\nWait. You can ride whales? I’m in.\n\n36. The Last Emperor\n\nThis is actually going to represent all of the last titles. The Last Samurai, The Last Dragon, Last of the Mohicans, etc.\n\n35. Embrace the Serpent\n\nNo thanks.\n\n34. Along Came a Spider\n\nCreepy\n\n33. Blade Runner\n\nWould’ve been higher but Oscar Pistorius made it feel all O.J.\n\n32. The Last Picture Show\n\nGreat name for a movie.\n\n31. Tears of the Sun\n\nSad. Hot. Intriguing.\n\n30. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\n\nI’m crazy about the title.\n\n29. Enter the Dragon\n\nAnother stand in. While deserving in its own right, this represents the overwhelming coolness of Bruce Lee movie titles: Fists of Fury, The Game of Death, The Way of the Dragon.\n\n28. Psycho\n\nFrighteningly fitting.\n\n27. Dr. Strangelove\n\nCould be interpreted so many ways.\n\n26. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\n\n\"Yeah, baby, yeah!\"\n\n25. I'm Gonna Get You Sucka\n\nI don’t know. It just makes me laugh.\n\n24. A Low Down Dirty Shame\n\nWe’re in the Wayans Bros. portion of the list.\n\n23. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nSo cool it became a thing.\n\n22.The Devil Wears Prada\n\nProbably an accurate statement\n\n21. Almost Famous\n\nNo almost about it. That’s cool.\n\n20. Run Lola Run\n\nKnow how to say “cool” in German? You just did.\n\n19. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\n\nGonna. Watch this. Movie. Now.\n\n18. Silence of the Lambs\n\nAre you really reading these captions? Probably not. The title says it all.\n\n17. Super Fly\n\nCool as the other side of the pillow.\n\n16. Zero Dark Thirty\n\nI was a QB in high school. This would’ve been my audible if my coach ever let me audible. Or play.\n\n15. Slumdog Millionaire\n\n#Winning\n\n14. There Will Be Blood\n\nOutstanding in its simplicity and power.\n\n13. The French Connection\n\nOui.\n\n12. Things We Lost in the Fire\n\nUnforgettable\n\n11. Apocalypse Now\n\nThe end is near.\n\n10. Gone With The Wind\n\nWell, I do declare. That’s a mighty fine title.\n\n9. No Country for Old Men\n\nSorry elderly gents, we’re building a wall.\n\n8. Mo Better Blues\n\nCool jazz, cool title.\n\n7. Fatal Attraction\n\nAn absolute killer, and I can’t stop thinking about it.\n\n6. Raging Bull\n\nA knockout\n\n5. Dangerous Liaisons\n\nBe careful out there.\n\n4. Cool Hand Luke\n\nNo failure to communicate here. Cool says it all.\n\n3. Rebel Without a Cause\n\nYou should turn up your collar when you watch this trailer.\n\n2. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nTrippy\n\n1. Last Tango in Paris\n\nThis is the ultimate in cool.\n\nBonus: Scarface\n\nThat's our list. You surely have suggestions for titles you would have added or left off. Tell us in the comments."
