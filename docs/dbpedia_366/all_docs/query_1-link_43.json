OBON invites the atomic bomb survivor to tell her own story. Borken shows the memories of the former East Germany female prisoner labored as a slave in the jail. Musical Traumas, like a musical diary, discussed the experiences of studying in a music school. Snow White Cologne deals with teenagers’ drug abuse issues. Carlotta’s Face depicts that a girl diagnosed with face blindness eventually finds the light through art. You Are Overreacting focuses on the circumstances of modern women and the impact of social media.\n\nThe other part of selected films were using ‘archive’ as their main concepts or media, using the hybrid of street footages in the real world, news, or historical archive, and so on to reflect on the authenticity. Feeling My Way, for example, blends the imaginary streets, road signs, and views into reality by sketching and drawing what’s on the way. Life Cycles corresponds to the director’s everyday life with the terror attack and air raids in Syria. Spirit Away uses the early technique, Magic Lantern, to produce the animation, connecting drawing images with the mental hospital's patient records. BOOKANIMA: Modern Dance & Jazz Dance reconnects the decomposition of movements, with the audio narration of dancers, to form another kind of documentary film.\n\nAnimated documentary provides directors with a broader scope of choices in self-expression. The intersection of the animated and documentary film enables the reenactment of incidents and the representation of the objects, circumstances, memory, or traumatic experiences to be expressed metaphorically. It expands the principles of documentary films, while widening the boundaries of animation. These selected films show the success hybrid of animation and documentary films.\n\nNarrative Animation: The Non-Fiction Animated Films\n\n11/28 12:20 2 12/01 14:20 2\n\nBroken - the women's prison at Hoheneck\n\nVolker SCHLECHT, Alexander LAHL Germany 2016 DCP Color + B&W 7 min Imprisoned by political oppression, female prisoners at Hoheneck Castle were forced to manufacture the linens secretly sent to Western Germany retailers, bringing enormous profits to both sides of the Iron Curtain. Women were deprived of their humanity, existing as nothing more than working machines. The film pairs original audio interview extracts with abstract, monochrome animation, providing a glimpse into the most notorious women’s prison in East Germany.\n\n2017\n\nOBON\n\nAndré HÖRMANN, Anna SAMO Germany 2018 DCP Color 15 min Obon is the annual Japanese commemoration that people pray for a better afterlife of their ancestors’ spirits. During Obon, Akiko Takakura, as one of the last survivors of the atomic bomb explosion of Hiroshima, talks about her story with her traditional and rigid father. Even though she lived in fear and nightmares every day after the explosion, she eventually experienced a precious and intimate time with her father.\n\n2018 2018 2018\n\nCarlotta’s Face\n\nValentin RIEDL, Frédéric SCHULD Germany 2018 DCP Color 5 min As a child, Carlotta didn’t know that a face was composed of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. She couldn’t recognize herself in a mirror, neither her teachers nor classmates. Years after, she was diagnosed with face blindness, a rare and incurable deficit of her brain. One day she found that people can draw self-portraits by touching their faces, bringing her a new way to recognize her face.\n\n2020\n\nFeeling My Way\n\nJonathan HODGSON UK 1997 DCP Color 6 min The film perceives the road from home to work from the POV of the protagonist. Combined with the moving collages and painterly animation with live-action footage, it seems to be filtered through the conscious and subconscious mind, sharing the traveler’s experiences and mental reactions to the trials and triviality of urban existence.\n\n1998 1998\n\nLife Cycles\n\nRoss HOGG UK 2016 DCP Color 4 min\n\nFollowing the POV of the protagonist, we can see the animation of his daily life embedded with the documentary news or Twitter posts. Among the daily routine and the weekend football game, the warfare became severe. The politicians talk about making changes. The animator wants to ask in the end: will we continue to let events pass us by uncontested, or will we decide to break the cycle?\n\n2017 2017\n\nBOOKANIMA: Jazz Dance Modern Dance\n\nShon KIM South Korea, USA 2018 DCP Color + B&W 2 min BOOKANIMA Book Anima\n\nBOOKANIMA, a compound word of ‘Book’ and ‘Anima’, is an experimental animation that gives new cinematic life to books. The selected films are Jazz and Modern Dance from the whole collection. Still images are reconnected by the animation technique, together with the audio interview of dancers, generating a new way of perception.\n\n2020 2020\n\nMusical Traumas\n\nMiloš TOMIĆ Serbia 2018 DCP Color 11 min Adapted by true stories of unhappy music students, the film shares their experiences from the beginning of learning music to those painful lessons. It is a rhythmic compilation of traumatic, but amusing confessions of former students, as well as an attempt to visualize music with scrumptious, hand-drawn animation. 2018 Anča 2018 Supertoon\n\nSnow White Cologne\n\nAmanda ELIASSON UK 2017 DCP Color 6 min The film is adapted from a true story. The director depicted her sister’s drug abuse when she was a teenager. Instead of being critical to judge right or wrong, she chose to perceive the issue from a poetic and emotional angle, transforming the incident into a visual artistic presentation.\n\n2018 VOID 2018\n\nSpirit Away\n\nBetina KUNTZSCH Germany 2015 DCP Color 7 min 35 The film’s inspiration comes from the director’s interests in the Prinzhorn Collection in Heidelberg in Germany and her collection of scanned original 35mm animated film loops for lantern magic from the period around 1900. She selects scenes of daily lives, such as washerwomen, magicians, or amusing situations with dancers. Then she reconstructs a fictive biography with a collage of text fragments from the patients' records. 2016 TRICKY WOMEN 2016 2FICAE 2015 DOK You Are Overreacting\n\nThis article is from:\n\n2020臺中國際動畫影展手冊\n\nby 2020tiaf"
