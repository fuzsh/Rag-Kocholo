        "text": "The disclaimer has an interesting history, and tvtropes has an expanded version of it:\n\nThis is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the author’s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.\n\nIt does not specifically mention businesses, but I feel that it is covered with names (and incidents and events).\n\nStill, keep in mind that this is not legal advice and that you might be liable even if you include such a disclaimer.\n\nI just finished watching the 1976 film Network about a fictitious television network, but that mentions the other real networks (such as ABC) and real companies (e.g. Disney, IBM, AT&T, Union Carbide). The disclaimer at the end of the film refers to firms:\n\nThe events, characters and firms depicted in the photoplay are ficticious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or to actual firms, is purely coincidental.\n\nThis type of disclaimer is quite common.\n\nHere's a suggestion inspired by computer science, where businesses, people and all kinds of other stuff can be simply generalised as entities.\n\nAll characters and other entities appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons or other real-life entities is purely coincidental.\n\nOr\n\nAll characters and other entities appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, dead or alive, or other real-life entities, past or present, is purely coincidental.\n\nOf course, this could be adapted and fine tuned. The principle suggestion is to gain coverage by the use of the word entities.\n\nThe other point I'd make is that existing disclaimers aren't always going to be adequate or appropriate to the modern world (i.e. the rise of brands, trademarks and business names as identities in their own right), so you shouldn't be afraid to improve on it by starting from scratch."
