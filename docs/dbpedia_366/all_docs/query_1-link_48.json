        "text": "Difference Between Fiction and Non-Fiction\n\nAll literature lovers know that literature has plenty of genres, which come under either of two categories- Fictional or Non-Fictional. Fiction is one that is based on imagination or fantasies, and one of the best examples of fiction is fairy tales. Non-Fiction implies the form of writing that is based on actual events that occurred in someone's life, and it also includes people and facts, and the best example of Non-Fiction literature is biography.\n\nTo put it in simple terms, we can say that Fiction represents something that is not true and is someone's imagination. On the other hand, Non-Fiction is true and written with facts and plenty of information.\n\nFiction can be understood as a literary work that is creative and based on someone's imagination. It showcases the author's creative side, or we can say that the creative thought of the author has been depicted in such \"made-up stories\" and in their characters.\n\nAs far as Non-Fictional Work is considered, it means reading out something that has actually happened and even about something that really exists. To put it in simple words, Non-Fiction is something that is not a \"cooked-up story\"; it is a fact and evidence-based account.\n\nThis article will briefly discuss the differences between Fiction and Non-Fiction.\n\nHere is a table of differences that will make you understand better the main differences between Fiction and Non-Fiction:\n\nCriteria Fiction Non-Fiction Meaning Fiction is the art of writing that does not contain any facts or real events. It is completely based on imagination. Non-Fiction is an art of writing that is based on facts, actual events, and on recorded information. Nature Fiction is subjective in nature Non-Fiction is Objective in Nature Flexibility Fiction Literature is Flexible. Non-Fictional Literature is not Flexible. Directness In Fictional Literature, readers are supposed to follow, understand the abstract, and even join the dots to understand the presented-imagined theme. In Non-Fictional character, the reader understands the concept by the direct presentation of information provided by the author. Purpose The purpose of Fictional Literature is to entertain the readers. The purpose of Non-Fictional Literature is to educate or inform the readers that actually occurred. References Under Fictional Literature, the reference may or may not be given. Under Non-Fictional Literature, the references are given in detail. Perspective Under Fictional Literature, the author uses Characters or Narrators to depict the author's perspective. Under Non-Fictional Literature, the author is the one who directly writes down their perspective.\n\nPoints of Comparison\n\n1. Definition\n\nDefinition of Fiction\n\nFiction can be stated as an imaginative creation, which actually does not exist in the real world. It is a small world that is depicted on the paper as the creative thoughts of the author. Fiction Literature can be stated as a type of imaginative prose literature that can be spoken as well as written. It contains imaginative characters, events, and descriptions that come together to build a beautiful story.\n\nWriting a fictional story basically means that the writers or authors create their own fantasy world in which different characters, imaginative twists, and event descriptions play the main role in building a story in the reader's mind as well. The story is not real and factual; the authors cook it up in a certain way that the story comes out to be really interesting and engaging.\n\nLet's have a look at the Fictional Literature from the reader's point of view:\n\nFrom the reader's point of view, fictional work refers to the creative fabrication of an imaginative world by the writer. By this, we basically mean to say that the author imagines the entire story and its main characters, the overall plot of the story that includes mysterious and crazy twists, dialogues, and setting of connecting dots as well.\n\nThe work of fiction writers is never based on a true story. So when the reader goes through such imaginative works, he or she visualizes the situation that is created by the author, which they never face in reality or come across those creative characters who they may never get a chance to meet in their real life. The fictional world may take the reader to a world where they may never go otherwise.\n\nFictional Literature is a form of entertainment, or we can say that it is a form of art that contains a hypothetical plot and eye catchy characteristics in any format; it could be in comics, television programs, drama, audio recordings, novels, fairy tales, films, novella, and many more.\n\nFiction includes genres like mystery, suspense, fantasies, crime thrillers, romance, science fiction, etc.\n\nFictional Art can inspire people, but not only this, but it also has the power to change people's perspectives towards life. It engages people in the imagined story so well that people, that people start looking at it as if the event is real.\n\nDefinition of Nonfiction\n\nIt can be said that Nonfiction is the wildest form of literature that contains abundance of information, education, and factual writings as well.\n\nNon-Fiction is basically a true account or representation of a particular event and also about a particular subject.\n\nWhen an author works on nonfictional work, he or she emphasizes on simplicity, clarity, and straightforwardness.\n\nNonfiction includes of essays, memoirs, documentaries, textbooks, biographies, autobiographies, books on history, politics, science, business and economics, self-help, and many more.\n\nA reader reads non fictional books to learn more about a certain subject and increase their knowledge.\n\n2. Difference of Nature\n\nIt is said that fiction is subjective in nature. It is said like this as the author has the freedom to add his opinion, creative thoughts, as well as perspectives to the written story. The writer has an open opportunity to elaborate on any character, plot, or setting as per his or her imagination.\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of non-fiction, it is said that it is objective in nature. The sole reason behind this is that the writer cannot add his or her own opinion. In Non-Fiction work, the writer has to purely shower the right facts and authentic information in their book, due to which there is no scope for imagination; the writer has to depict the story or an event in a straightforward manner.\n\n3. Difference in Flexibility\n\nIn the case of fictional work, the writer has the flexibility, to move the story in their own way- they can make it interesting as well as exciting in their own directions.\n\nOn the other hand, nonfictional writers don't have this flexibility as they have to provide actual facts and information, which has to be real and true.\n\n4. Difference in Directness\n\nWhen it comes to the difference in directness, in fictional work, the writer is of the opinion that the audience will flow and connect the hidden dots in the theme, which are secretive and creatively written in the content. In fact, in fictional writing, even the readers have the opportunity to interpret the story in their own way.\n\nOn the other hand, in non-fictional writing, there is a complete directness to the story- the writer can't add twists and turns according to themselves; they have to directly present the information and facts that actually occurred in the event.\n\n5.Difference in Purpose\n\nThe main purpose of the writers for writing fiction stories is to entertain the audience with their creative mindset, and on the other hand, the purpose of the non-fiction writers is to educate the reader about a specific subject and also to increase their knowledge.\n\n6. Difference of References\n\nUnder fictional writing, it is up to the writer whether they want to put references or not, but in non-fictional writing, it is mandatory to write down references whenever required. Through this, the writers sought of puts a stamp on the book related to the credibility of information showcased in the context.\n\n7. Difference of Perspectives\n\nFiction writing is always from the perspective of the narrators. Through this, we mean to say that the writer and the story's characters are the content's main or supporting characters. Whereas, in non-fiction, it is always the perspective of the author, and the author, in this case, is the one who went through the event covered in the story.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we can say that fiction and non-fiction are highly apart from each other. In a fictional story, it is completely the creative mindset and thoughts of the writer, and in the case of non-fiction, it is all about the actual event that occurred, and its purpose is simply to provide knowledge to the reader."
