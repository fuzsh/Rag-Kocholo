Your Netflix queue is always stacked with movies and shows to hit play on, but what you might not know is that there’s a hidden way to make that viewing experience even better.

Amongst the films and TV series for your viewing pleasure, there’s a trove of secret category codes — a list that dates back to the earliest days of the company and already tops 36,000 (yes, really!) and is always growing, a treat for fans who either know exactly what they want to watch or want to try something entirely new. To explore these collections — ordering off the secret menu, if you will — all you need to do is fire up your web browser, type in “netflix.com/browse/genre/” and then add your ID code of choice to the end of the URL. So if you’re in the mood for something as specific as, say, Gentle British Reality TV (with the code 81240711) or Witchcraft & the Dark Arts (81552046), or think all movies should be short (90-Minute Movies, aka 81466194), there’s a code and corresponding collection waiting for you.

According to Mary Bertone of Netflix’s evidence team, these codes date back to the days when Netflix was still in its DVDs-only phase. At the time, Netflix.com had a public-facing genre tree that linked out to all the various types of films and TV series, each of which has its own specific ID code. A fan scraped the genre tree for all the codes, shared the list online, and people have been using those codes (along with the thousands more that have been added since) to this day.

New codes are being added whenever inspiration strikes. In the afterglow of Bridgerton Season 3’s release, a collection titled Lady Whistledown’s Whisper-Worthy Tales (81787782) arrived, offering recommendations that deal in gossip, intrigue, and romance — all topics the secretive scribe would delight in. And as Michael Raphan, a curation strategist at Netflix, tells Tudum, a conversation with a colleague about the Noah Centineo-starring series The Recruit — a spy adventure with romantic subplots — prompted him to create a collection, fittingly, called Action with a Side of Romance (81647318).

The Pop Culture Now collection (34399) highlights what people are tuned into at any given moment — everything from a list of shows like Baby Reindeer (fittingly titled “u herd of baby reindeer? ok more like it,” 81783651) to baseball season (Take Me Out to the Ball Game, 81777527), and summer concerts (The Endless Tour, 81719779). The time of year and personal tastes come into play, too. Around Halloween you might find something available like Small Town Scares (81496215), or romance rows will materialize near Valentine’s Day. One of the first rows curation strategist Mary McIlwain created was called Twisted Christmas (2300975): “I love feel-good Christmas movies, but at the same time, I’m on the ‘Die Hard is a Christmas movie’ team,” she says. “So I wanted a row where that could be highlighted.”

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, rows like Human Connections (81271205) were created to try and help people feel better. Other times, inspiration comes from outside the queue: When Pete Davidson rapped about wanting to watch “Short-Ass Movies” on Saturday Night Live in 2022, the team responded with a collection of the same name (81603903). But whether it’s Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon (81614959), Spicy Romance (81572628), or Lavish Reality Lifestyles (81418611), these collections are all designed in the hopes of making users’ viewing experiences more enjoyable.

“Why do you choose what to watch? It could be a lot of different things — it could be something about the picture is enticing, there’s an actor that you know, you’ve heard of it somewhere else. And I think one of those things is how it’s framed, what titles are sitting around it,” notes Raphan. “So putting a new thing out there that can capture someone’s attention, that’s kind of cool.”

For a starter pack, scroll through some of the options we’ve linked above and below, which are a combination of codes highlighted by McIlwain and Raphan, options popular with fans, and a few that we just think are fun. You’ll never look at your home page the same way again.
