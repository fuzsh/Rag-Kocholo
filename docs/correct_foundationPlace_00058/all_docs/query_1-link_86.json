Keep your kidneys healthy… get checked. 2\n\n3. Chairman and President’s Message The 2007-2008 ﬁscal year was a good one for the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan (NKFM). We’re extremely proud of all we’ve accomplished in what most might say was a tough year in Michigan. The NKFM is still on the front line of Michigan’s ﬁght against chronic kidney disease and we have our eyes ﬁrmly ﬁxed on the future. The most startling statistic of one in nine Michigan adults has chronic kidney disease changed this year. One in eight Michigan adults now has chronic kidney disease and most don’t know it. One in three children born in the United States in 2000 will develop diabetes. The number of people with kidney disease and associated healthcare costs continue to rise but the NKFM is out front with grass roots, innovative prevention programs that are making a true diﬀerence. Taking a page from the NKFM’s ﬁrst and very successful prevention programs, Healthy Hair Starts with a Healthy Body™ and Dodge the Punch: Live Right™, we’ve developed a number of other programs which have proven successful. This was the second year of our Regie’s Rainbow Adventure program which educates kids on the importance of eating fruits and vegetables using the colors of the rainbow. We’re excited to report we’ve seen the same positive behavior change outcomes we’ve experienced with other prevention programs. Daniel M. Carney President and CEO The NKFM will continue to be the leading non-proﬁt resource for those at risk of developing kidney disease, those who have CKD, the family members it aﬀects, and kidney disease professionals. We’ll continue to advocate for, listen to and empower people across the state whose lives have somehow been touched by kidney disease. M. David Campbell Chairman, Board of Directors The NKFM constantly relies on the guiding principles of the organization which include . . . • Striving to prevent chronic kidney disease CKD and its leading causes; diabetes and hypertension. • Advocating for people living with and at risk of CKD • Promoting quality of care for people with CKD, diabetes and hypertension • Educating the public about CKD, diabetes, hypertension and obesity • Promoting organ and tissue donation • Supporting research of CKD The NKFM was honored to receive a 4 star rating from Charity Navigator, the nation’s premier charity evaluator. The coveted ranking shows that NKFM outperforms the majority of other nonproﬁt agencies in America in ﬁscal responsibility. This exceptional designation diﬀerentiates us from our peers and demonstrates the reliability and eﬃciency of the our services. Everyday we’re reminded of the time, talent, and commitment of our wonderful volunteers and friends without whom we would be unable to do what we do. Thank you for helping us to be the most eﬀective aﬃliate of the National Kidney Foundation and for your continued support this past year. Your eﬀorts are making lives better for others! 3\n\n4. Touching a Child’s Life NKFM Kids Programs NKFM has developed and provided three school programs to teachers and their students for the past several years. Over the last twelve years KICK: Kids Interested in the Care of Their Kidneys has provided teachers with materials and a lesson plan to teach over 834,000 middle and high school students the importance of diagnosing and treating diabetes and hypertension. KICK also makes the case for students to sign the organ donor registry. Kids and Kidneys, aimed at fourth through sixth graders has been used by teachers with 161,000 kids in eight years. This program, recently approved as a supplementary lesson by the Michigan Model for Health education, emphasizes the importance of good nutrition and physical activity as a means to avoid diabetes and hypertension and therefore to avoid or delay kidney disease. Our third school education program, Healthy Kids and Kidneys, utilizes health professionals to teach sixth grade students the importance of developing healthy lifestyles in order to maintain good “kidney health.” The Healthy Kids and Kidneys curriculum, an eight week, one hour per week course, has been honed for ﬁve years at Hutchins Middle School in Detroit and in middle schools in Pontiac for three years. In 2007, funding was secured to expand the program from an average of 80 students per year to 450 students per year. 4\n\n5. Preventing Disease in the African American Community Healthy Hair Starts with a Healthy Body tarts Body™ The National Kidney Foundation of Michigan’s Healthy Hair Starts with a Healthy Body™ program continued its success this year by training more than 270 hair stylists to speak with their clients about living healthier lifestyles. With the help of these dedicated stylists, the program educated 3,956 African American women about the treatment and prevention of chronic kidney disease and its two leading causes; diabetes and high blood pressure. Stylists provided clients in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Flint, Inkster, Muskegon, Pontiac, Southﬁeld and Ypsilanti with important health messages and informational materials encouraging them to make healthy lifestyle choices. The foundation of the Healthy Hair program is based on the strong, trusting relationship African American women typically have with their hair stylists. In the program, stylists serve as lay health advisors with their clients, oﬀering a “health chat,” brochures, and incentives to compel clients to improve their overall health behavior. Referral resources to meet the needs of low-income and/or uninsured clients are also included. Through the program, clients are urged to make healthier food choices, get thirty minutes of exercise on most days, stop smoking, and take medication if already diagnosed. They are also encouraged to visit their doctor to get tested and discuss their risk for disease. Each client receives a “Wellness Score Card” to track the results of their diagnostic tests. The Score Card includes several health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), and body mass index. 5\n\n6. Connecting to People with Chronic Kidney Disease Public Policy Advocacy During 2008, NKFM advocacy focused on continued state funding for the Michigan Strategic Plan for the Prevention, Early Detection and Control of Chronic Kidney Disease. As Michigan struggled with diﬃcult economic times, the legislature voted to appropriate $3,999,000 in ﬁscal year 2007-2008 to the Diabetes and Kidney Programs line in the Michigan Department of Community Health budget. At the federal level, NKFM advocacy also helped provide a new Medicare beneﬁt that will educate people nearing kidney failure about their treatment options of dialysis or kidney transplant. NKFM gained the support of state legislators by educating them about the beneﬁts of disease prevention. NKFM prevention programs target: 1.) primary prevention 2.) secondary prevention focused on early detection and treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure to prevent chronic kidney disease (diabetes and high blood pressure are the two leading causes of kidney failure) 3.) early detection and treatment of chronic kidney disease to delay kidney failure. Programs place an emphasis on high risk minority populations, especially people of African American heritage. The NKFM “People Like Us Take Action” volunteers are our best advocates and the strength behind our public policy success stories. Senator Roger Kahn MD and Representative Gary McDowell were recognized at the NKFM 2008 Champion of Hope Tribute Dinner. Both played a signiﬁcant role in maintaining the Diabetes and Kidney Programs line in the state budget. 6\n\n7. Investing in the Future Healthy Families Start with You The Healthy Families Start with You program is stronger than ever. Twenty-ﬁve new Head Start staﬀ members in Head Start agencies in Detroit, Pontiac, and Traverse City have been trained to have ‘health chats’ with Head Start parents. These lay health educators have explained the association between lifestyle choices like nutrition and physical activity and risk for chronic disease development to Head Start parents. The cookbook, resource guide, measuring cups, pedometers, and health brochures they distributed helped parents to put healthy lifestyle behaviors into practice. The Regie’s Rainbow Adventure program was introduced into curriculum at Head Start agencies in Detroit and Pontiac. The Regie’s Rainbow Adventure program is a curriculum that emphasizes eating fruits and vegetables that are the colors of the rainbow. Teachers are given 6 stories to read, each focusing on a diﬀerent color. The plot for each story centers on Regie Rainbow Man, a superhero who must travel to various food islands and eat healthy foods of a particular color to earn his power stripe. Of the 359 parents through Healthy Families Start with You program and 242 children through the Regie Rainbow Adventure program has reached, 60% of adults and their children made at least one healthy lifestyle change, including increasing exercise (41%), increasing consumption of fruits (34%) and vegetables (34%) and reducing consumption of fast food (26%) and pop (22%) among other changes. 7\n\n8. Development Kidney Ball: Motown Magic The NKFM gathered its friends and supporters for the 3rd Annual Kidney Ball on December 8, 2007 at the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center. The black-tie event, themed “Motown Magic,” attracted 700 attendees and raised $600,000 for the numerous programs and services the NKFM oﬀers to the many residents currently living with chronic kidney disease and those at risk. The Motown inspired evening included a cocktail hour, dinner, live and silent auctions, and live entertainment by Rumplestiltskin. The soulful sounds of Motown being played throughout the night helped to create an (l to r) Troy and Jean Clarke, Cindy and Steve Shannon atmosphere unlike any other black-tie event in metro Detroit. The Honorary Chairs for the evening were Troy and Jean Clarke. Troy is President of General Motors North America. Steve and Cindy Shannon, serving as Chairs of the event, along with a number of committed Executive and Host Committee members, really helped to make the night a huge success. From the dedication of our outstanding committee to the eﬀorts of our wonderful volunteers, the NKFM is lucky to have so many friends and supporters.
