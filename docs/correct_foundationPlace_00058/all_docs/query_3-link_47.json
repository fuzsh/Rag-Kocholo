Connect with Work training program provides exposure to real-life corporate situations through case studies, role plays, ‘learn-with-fun,’ and high impact activities. The program bridges the gap between academia and the industry with experiential learning driven by technology.\n\nUnshackling Individuals\n\nthrough Social Mobility.\n\nOur Social Mobility CSR programs focus on uplifting adults who have had to drop out of formal education due to challenging socio-economic circumstances. Our training programs unshackle these individuals trapped in virtually life-long low-income jobs due to limited skills and bring them into higher social strata.\n\nBy upskilling individuals in areas of digital literacy, confidence-building, and conversational English, GTT projects have helped them break socio-economic barriers and enhance their income.\n\nISS\n\n800 blue-collared workers successfully trained in digital literacy\n\nWe created a tailored program for ISS, a leading provider of facilities services to train 800 front-line staff to positively impact their social mobility and customer service skills. The program focused on mindset shift for self-motivation and upskilling for digital literacy.\n\nOur trainers created learning experiences that enhanced their communication skills, made them digitally literate, enhanced their grooming skills, and helped them create aspirational dreams. We helped the facilities staff with skills development training sessions provide a delightful experience to customers and their internal stakeholders exhibiting exemplary services.\n\nUnderstanding mindset, Grooming & etiquettes, Customer/People handling, Business communications, digital literacy\n\nBARCLAYS CSR Program\n\n200,000 youths get employment-ready under CSR Skills Development Program\n\nThe program bridged the inherent gaps between employer expectations and employability skills in young graduates. Since the last 4 years, young underprivileged college graduates have been trained on a variety of real-world skills ranging from communications, corporate work culture, teamwork and domain-specific training. Training and mentoring programs aimed at community support, and a sustainable foundation to create inclusive prosperity for current and future generations. Participants were placed Telecom, Power and Energy, Auto, Hospitality, and IT companies.\n\nSkill development, Training on corporate trends, Being corporate ready, Communication skills- Presentability, and grooming for success\n\nISHANYA Foundation\n\nLives of 80 underprivileged individuals from rural community get transformed with self-reliance and digital literacy skills\n\nGTT was brought on board to help with the Ishanya foundation’s initiative of making underprivileged individuals self-reliant. Unique self-realization and digital literacy programs were put in place to train the beneficiaries from rural and challenging backgrounds for gainful employment opportunities. The program exposed the beneficiaries to the world of possibilities to ignite passion, self-motivation, and aspirations for a better life.\n\nThe program delivered impactful training that prepared them for the present and also equipped them for success in future.\n\nDigital literacy"
