The last 6 years have been nothing short of a fantastic ride – right from heading a strong #digital team to recruiting & #mentoring upcoming digital talents, from advising senior leaders to sharing leadership insights on my own, from getting a few external industry #awards under my belt to being a #speaker on some notable forums. This journey has been #incredible. I am deeply grateful to my awesome team members across India, EU, NA; my wonderful colleagues from the Marcom agency, and have been very fortunate to have worked with a lot of talented, highly experienced #B2B professionals across comms, #marketing, #sales, #brand, #IT, and #legal teams. #teamappreciation A BIG thank you to my #leaders and #mentors: Sameer Arora, Sudha Balasubramanian, Martin Pietersen, Michèle Claverie and Aditya Hirlekar for their faith and belief in me, who guided me and supported me throughout my journeys, and to the wonderful leaders with whom I got a chance to work in different capacities: Rakesh Khanna, Murli Reddy, Anette Rey, Nourdine Bihmane, Dorien Wamelink, Clement Huillet, you continue to be an #inspiration. #incrediblepeople #inspirationalleaders I am very excited about my new stint, and I am eagerly looking forward to the new adventures that await me."
