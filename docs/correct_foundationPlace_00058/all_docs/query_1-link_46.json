Building on our decades of advanced engineering, technology and research and development experience, we have always sought to deliver technology solutions that solve problems today while giving our customers a path to succeed over the long term. Our Annual Report shows how Alion has again crafted solutions that act as springboards for our customers’ future successes; many include first-ever technologies and approaches, and all represent the innovative concepts and technical skill that are central to all our work. This approach also describes Alion’s business strategies. Despite the economic issues faced by governments, companies and individuals around the world, we remain positive and, if anything, even more committed to delivering value to our customers and employee-owners. We continually evaluate our plans and goals to ensure that we are doing the best for our stakeholders.

Looking ahead, I am optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. This is especially due to our employees, who bring their skills, talents and experiences to bear on every challenge. They also bring intangible qualities that make all the difference: curiosity, tenacity and a dedication to finding better, smarter answers to our customers’ toughest problems. Alion, as always, will remain agile, responsive and committed to delivering exceptional services and technologies, today and in the future. With our people, resources and strategic vision, Alion is fully prepared to meet what comes next. Regards, Bahman Atefi Chairman and CEO Message froM the ChairMan and Ceo 1 I am proud to report that FY 08 was another positive year for Alion. We refined our strategies in key areas, strengthened our financial foundation and were successful in winning several new programs. We have continued to focus on organic growth in our core areas of strength. While the economic environment that emerged during the past year has challenged individuals, businesses and countries the world over, Alion remains on solid ground thanks to our continued focus on the fundamentals of our business: outstanding service to our customers, financial responsibility, technological leadership, community involvement and, of course, employee ownership. At Alion, we’ve always taken a global perspective. Our business operates as part of a worldwide economy that recognizes the need for innovation, efficiency and value. Our people, located across the U.S. and abroad, support customers whose diverse needs require the engineering, analytical and operational expertise that Alion brings to each engagement. As you’ll read in this year’s Annual Report, Alion’s solutions continue to advance the state of technology. Alion is helping U.S. forces train troops and commanders around the world; we’re working with the Navy to enhance anti-submarine defenses and we’re helping improve domestic security and preparedness. Our experts are also creating advanced solutions to preserve the environment and explore the depths of space. Part of our company culture is to encourage our scientists and technologists to stretch their imaginations. Each year, we make a substantial investment in internal research and development; many of the technologies and methods developed through this program solve real-world problems for our customers.

These programs are reminders that our employee-owners approach every challenge with ingenuity and a commitment to problem solving. This same attitude applies as we look outside of our company to the communities in which we live and work. Alion Cares, our corporate giving program, was founded last year to help concentrate our charitable efforts, and the program continues to grow and improve. This year, offices across the country participated in local and national events from waterfront cleanups to fundraising walks. Once again, our science and technology grant program contributed thousands of dollars toward science and technology education in schools. In addition, it’s gratifying to see how many Alion employee-owners volunteer their personal time on a regular basis. With the people, processes and corporate culture we have in place, I can confidently say that Alion is ready to face the challenges of today’s marketplace. In every office, at every customer site, our employee-owners prove their commitment to innovation and excellence. We will continue to bring scientific, technical and engineering advances to our customers while building greater value for our stakeholders.

Alion Science and Technology 2010 Annual Report 4. Alion Science and Technology Collateral Budget demands now require that U.S. naval ships stay in service longer than originally planned, so ensuring these vessels are operationally ready is crucial to the Navy’s mission. Alion is delivering comprehensive solutions to manage the maintenance and modernization programs for all of the Navy’s 165 surface ships while providing targeted engineering responses to emerging technical challenges. Additionally, Alion supported the standup of the Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP), an organization responsible for managing the long-term maintenance requirements for surface ships, by helping to introduce greater discipline and rigor to the maintenance process. By improving communication between shipyards and drafting an enhanced long-term maintenance schedule, which is critical to keeping surface ships in the fleet, Alion is helping NAVSEA’s Surface Warfare Directorate manage costs while keeping the fleet mission-ready. 4 Extending the Life of Surface Ships 4 5 training is fundamental to mission execution. For U.S. Air Forces Central (USAFCENT), delivering training effectively means analyzing the needs, developing coursework and coordinating resources for hundreds of Command and Control personnel. With Alion’s training management capabilities, USAFCENT’s Combined Air and Space Operations Center (CAOC) at Shaw AFB, SC, provides comprehensive training on the Air Operations Center weapons system and theater operations. Our experts support leading edge technology, including the development and fielding of trusted thin client solutions as well as operation of a comprehensive learning management system. We also design numerous training programs, including a first- ever curriculum to instruct deploying special technical operations personnel. Additionally, Alion experts analyzed tactics, techniques and procedures to develop time-saving, effective solutions to improve airpower support to counter-insurgency operations. Alion’s support and expertise has led to a 15 percent reduction in air battle planning time and has enhanced joint forces integration through training for combat operations.

Briscoe Consulting Logo and Collateral CONTRIBUTION TO THE INDUSTRY The Customer Service Center enhances the ability of Eclipse Aviation to meet the needs of their customers and showcase their state-of- the-art aircraft. The Center has been highly successful for the Sales and Marketing team at Eclipse. It combines space for multiple customers to have an intimate experience, a showroom for their product, and an environment for customer related events in an under-utilized industrial space adjacent to their existing facility. By making their business more successful, it has made both the design firm and the general contractor succeed in the design and construction industry. ABILITY TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES The primary challenge was to create the physical and psychological TRANSFORMATION OF A CAVERNOUS, INDUSTRIAL HANGER INTO A WARM AND INVITING SPACE FOR CUSTOMER INTERACTION. This was accomplished by creating a series of \"rooms within a room,\" building out the space within the existing raw space. The hanger had minimal heating and cooling, so additional heating pumps were installed and compressed air lines relocated. The goal was to take advantage of the high ceilings and the industrial feel of the hanger and still create a warm and intimate experience for the customers. The transformation begins at the private entrance into the customer lounge from the main facility lobby. The lounge and signing rooms have lower ceilings and are more traditionally finished spaces. Stepped windows provide a glimpse of the aircraft in the showroom, which maintains the character and expanse of the original hangar. The showroom and the delivery area keep the feel of the hanger but have been upgraded with high gloss white floor that matches the paint color of the jet, additional display lighting grids and large scale Eclipse graphics. Another challenge was to combine the various functions of the Customer Service Center INTO A COHESIVE WHOLE. The flow from public lounge space to signing room to showroom and the need to keep the hangar functional for jet delivery was constrained by the limited size and configuration of the existing hangar. THE SOLUTION WAS TO CREATE MULTI- FUNCTIONAL, DIRECT-ACCESS SPACES to minimize the need for corridors. In addition, a limited finish palette was used and extends from space to space. Glass was incorporated to expand the view of into the showroom and increase the perception of open space. OVERALL EXCELLENCE In summary, the successful transformation of an existing aircraft hangar into a Customer Service Center allows Eclipse Aviation to meet the needs of their customers while showcasing their state-of-the-art aircraft. A previously cold, utilitarian space is now an inviting multi-functional facility that showcases the innovation and personal experience that defines Eclipse Aviation.
