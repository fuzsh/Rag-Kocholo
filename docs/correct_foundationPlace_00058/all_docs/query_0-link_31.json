        "text": "This page is about the city in Oakland County. For the township in Newaygo County, see Troy Township, Michigan.\n\nTroy is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Its population was 84,035 at the 2022 census, making Troy the most populous city in the county and the 13th most-populous municipality in the state. Troy is a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, located about sixteen miles (25.7 km) northwest of downtown Detroit.\n\nTroy was organized as a township in 1827, and sections of the township incorporated much later into the cities of Birmingham, Clawson, and Royal Oak. The remainder of the township incorporated as the present-day city of Troy in 1955.\n\nTroy has become a business and shopping destination in the region, with numerous office centers and the upscale Somerset Collection mall. In 2011, Troy was ranked the safest city in Michigan and the 19th safest city in the United States. In 2008, Troy was ranked 22nd on a list of \"Best Places to Live\" in the United States by CNN Money, using criteria including housing, quality of education, economic strength, and recreational opportunities. In 2008, Troy was also ranked as the fourth most-affordable U.S. city with a median household income of approximately $79,000.\n\nHistory\n\nThe earliest recorded purchases of land in what was known as Troy Township occurred in 1819. A couple of years later a settlement known as Troy Corners was established due to Johnson Niles buying 160 acres in the region. The area is currently the north-central area of Troy. In 1827 Troy Township was established. In 1955 Troy was officially incorporated primarily as a strategy for preventing border cities from taking more land.....http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/michigan/troy\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.64 square miles (87.13 km2), of which 33.47 square miles (86.69 km2) is land and 0.17 square miles (0.44 km2) is water. The latitude of Troy is 42.605 N, and the longitude is 83.15 W. The mean elevation is 748 ft (228 m).\n\nClimate\n\nCulture\n\nThe Troy Historic Village is a fully interactive historical museum chronicling the different stages of Troy's progression from its first settlers to the city it has become today. Located at the corners of Livernois Road and Wattles Road, the village is located behind the old city hall building. Open year-round, the village has ten original, complete structures which patrons may enter and observe how they functioned in the past and how they were decorated, as all buildings are full of artifacts from that period. Each structure is original and was painstakingly moved from its original location to the museum intact. Starting with a log and mud structure used by the first settlers, there is also an 18th-century schoolhouse and estate, a general store, a blacksmith's shop, a church along with the pastor's home, and the old city hall, which acts as a general museum. There is a gazebo in the center of the square which will host parties and period bands during annual festivities. Many schools from around the area plan field trips to the museum, and the church is also available for weddings.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary, ceramic beaver statues, each standing four feet (1.2 m) high, were displayed at various locations in the city. The beaver is the symbol of Troy, and the city's main commercial thoroughfare (Big Beaver Road) is named after it.\n\nTroy is also home to two of the largest Protestant churches in the USA, Kensington Community Church and Woodside Bible Church.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America Metropolis of Detroit is headquartered in Troy.\n\nSports\n\nIn 2003, Troy was named Michigan's Sportstown by Sports Illustrated magazine for having the top community sports programs in the state.\n\nMedia\n\nIn addition to the Detroit News and Detroit Free Press, regional newspapers serving all of southeast Michigan, the city is served by the Daily Tribune (which is published twice a week), the Troy Beacon [1](published every Thursday), the Troy Times, and the Troy-Somerset Gazette [2] and, most recently, Troy Patch.
