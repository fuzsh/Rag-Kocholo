        "text": "Category: Women\n\nDemocrats Face Historic Decision: Kamala Harris as Presidential Candidate Amid Challenges of Race and Gender\n\nThe Democratic Party faces a historic decision if it turns to Vice President Kamala Harris as its presidential candidate, navigating a complex landscape of racism, sexism, and her past political challenges in an attempt to defeat Republican Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, 81, declared on Sunday that he would end his campaign for reelection but remain in office for the remainder of his term. Concurrently, he endorsed Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Biden stated, “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made,” and continued, “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.”\n\nThis decision follows mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers and donors who questioned Biden’s ability to endure another four-year term due to concerns about his mental and physical stamina.\n\nIn over two centuries of American democracy, the electorate has chosen only one Black president and never a woman, raising questions even among some Black voters about whether Harris can shatter these enduring barriers. LaTosha Brown, a political strategist and co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, acknowledged this challenge, saying, “Will her race and gender be an issue? Absolutely.”\n\nHarris would face significant obstacles if promoted to the top of the ticket. With less than three months to campaign, she must unite the party and secure financial support. Despite these hurdles, many Democrats view her potential candidacy with optimism. At 59, Harris is notably younger than Trump and stands out as a leader in the party on abortion rights, an issue that resonates with younger voters and the progressive base. Advocates believe her candidacy would energize these voters, consolidate Black support, and leverage her strong debating skills to challenge Trump effectively. Brown pointed out, “That to me is reflective of America’s past. She is reflective of America’s now and future,” contrasting Harris’s candidacy with Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, both of whom are white.\n\nNonetheless, Harris’s initial years in office and brief 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination have left some Democrats apprehensive. There are concerns about her ability to overcome the historical baggage of racial and gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nIn a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll, Harris and Trump were tied at 44% support each, following an assassination attempt against Trump. In the same poll, Trump led Biden 43% to 41%, within the margin of error. Harris’s approval ratings are slightly higher than Biden’s, with 38.6% of Americans approving of her compared to 50.4% disapproving, whereas Biden has 38.5% approval and 56.2% disapproval.\n\nRepresentative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a Biden supporter, expressed skepticism about Harris’s potential support, stating on Instagram, “If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Kamala – Vice President Harris – you would be mistaken. There’s no safe option.”\n\nBarack Obama remains the only Black president elected in the U.S., and Hillary Clinton was the sole woman to lead a major party’s presidential ticket, losing to Trump in 2016. Harris, the first woman and the first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, has faced and weathered unfair attacks related to her race and gender, according to her supporters. Jamal Simmons, a former aide to Harris, noted, “America has a history of racism, sexism, so I’m sure that will factor into this conversation, factor into her campaign,” adding that there is potential for Black voters and women to rally behind her candidacy, benefiting from her race and gender.\n\nHarris has greater name recognition compared to other potential Democratic candidates, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Simmons argued, “While she has flaws and faults like everyone, we know those flaws and faults, so you can build a campaign with clarity. Any other candidates are complete unknowns.”\n\nA former Democratic lawmaker, who spoke anonymously, viewed Harris as a bigger risk due to her record rather than her race, citing early staff turnover and limited progress on key issues. The former lawmaker remarked, “I think the race thing is just a compounding factor or an exacerbating factor,” expressing a preference for another candidate despite recognizing the risks.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of employing racist and sexist rhetoric. In 2020, he claimed Harris, a U.S. citizen born in California, did not qualify to be a vice presidential candidate. At a recent rally in Michigan, Trump derided Harris’s mannerisms, calling her “Laughing Kamala” and criticizing her laugh as “crazy.” Trump’s campaign dismissed these criticisms as “classic disinformation” and highlighted Trump’s strong polling among African Americans, according to senior adviser Jason Miller.\n\nTrump’s previous “birtherism” claims against Obama, which falsely questioned his birthplace, garnered significant traction among far-right activists and his nationalist base. Cliff Albright, co-founder and CEO of Black Voters Matter Fund, referred to this pattern as “birtherism 2.0” regarding Harris. Nadia Brown, director of the women’s and gender studies program at Georgetown University, emphasized the persistence of reluctance to accept women, particularly Black women, in prominent leadership roles, stating, “Patriarchy is a hell of a drug.”\n\nDespite these challenges, Harris’s standing within the party has improved due to her vocal defense of reproductive rights following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Biden credited her efforts with helping to avert a significant Republican wave in the midterm elections, and Harris has actively campaigned on abortion rights.\n\nHarris could potentially inherit Biden’s strong support among Black voters, who were crucial to his 2020 nomination. However, if the Democratic Party coalesces around her, she may face criticism from voters who believe the party concealed Biden’s weaknesses. Gina Gannon, a 65-year-old retiree from Georgia who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, expressed dissatisfaction, saying, “I’m kind of done with the Democrats. So many knew about Biden’s condition and hid it. Kamala was part of that.”\n\nJD Vance’s Family Faces Anti-Asian Backlash Amidst Rising Racial Tensions in Political Climate\n\nUsha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, and their children have faced backlash due to their Indian heritage. Chilukuri Vance, whose parents are Indian immigrants, and RNC speaker Harmeet Dhillon, a Sikh of Indian descent, are being targeted with anti-Asian hate from far-right individuals online. This surge in hateful posts, following Vance’s nomination, criticizes his interracial marriage and expresses fears about increased Indian immigration, citing the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory. These posts have garnered hundreds of thousands of views according to engagement figures.\n\nStop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group tracking anti-Asian hate incidents, condemned the attacks. The group stated that the wave of hate has exacerbated the “heightened levels of fear and anxiety Asian Americans and immigrants are currently experiencing across the country leading up to this year’s presidential election.” They further noted, “In the midst of an inflamed political climate, we continue to see the targeting of South Asians across parties, including ongoing questioning of VP Kamala Harris’ electability.”\n\nSince 2020, Stop AAPI Hate has recorded thousands of potential hate-motivated incidents, coinciding with the rise in anti-Asian sentiment at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe backlash against the Vance family occurs as former President Donald Trump called for national unity following an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally last weekend. Trump remarked, “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,” during his speech on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nThis call for unity contrasts sharply with Trump’s usual rhetoric, often criticized as “inflammatory” and “divisive,” particularly regarding race and immigration. However, Trump quickly reverted to his typical stance, declaring, “The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country,” referring to undocumented migrants at the U.S. border.\n\nDespite this assertion, newly released figures from the CBP show a continuous decline in encounters at the southern border for the fourth consecutive month. Trump continued, “They are coming in from every corner of the Earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East — they’re coming from everywhere, and this administration does nothing to stop them.”\n\nIn contrast, the CBP reports that recent measures, including President Biden’s June 4 executive order limiting asylum access between ports of entry, have led to a more than 50% reduction in border encounters over the past six weeks.\n\nJD Vance has previously criticized Trump and his supporters for their racial rhetoric, which forms the backdrop of the current backlash against his wife and children. In a 2016 interview with POLITICO, Vance remarked, “the Trump people are certainly more racist than the average white professional,” warning that Trump’s rhetoric would cause white people to “become more racist over time.”\n\nVance also stated in a 2016 PBS Newshour interview, “there is definitely an element of Donald Trump’s support that has its basis in racism or xenophobia.”\n\nOriginally a “Never Trump guy,” Vance has since changed his stance, citing Trump’s “many successes in office.” He has now joined Trump on the Republican ticket for the upcoming presidential election in November. Vance’s alignment with Trump began around 2021, when he started praising Trump’s presidency and apologizing for his past criticisms. Last month, Vance told Fox News anchor Bret Baier, “Look, I was wrong about Donald Trump. I didn’t think he was going to be a good president, Bret. He was a great president, and it’s one of the reasons why I’m working so hard to make sure he gets a second term.”\n\nAAPI’s Women’s Leadership Forum Focuses on “Celebrating Women of Excellence”\n\nWomen are leading the world by being the proponents of economic empowerment, strengthening educational organizations, and being a powerful voice in politics. They have overcome obstacles and have shown the world what a woman can achieve and contribute to the betterment of the world as never before in human history. AAPI’s Women’s Leadership Forum focused on “Celebrating Women of Excellence”\n\nModerated by Dr. Bhavani Srinivasan and co-moderated by Dr. Mamta Singhvi co moderator, past president of MSRF and led by Dr. Anjana Samadder, president of AAPI, the Forum had Smiriti Irani, former federal Minister from India and Bollywood star, Dr. Leena Gupta, Regional Director from the West Coast, Yoshita Singh, Press Trust of India, Chief Correspondent for USA and the United Nations, Dr. Soumya Vishvanathan, a physician and corporate leader, leading a group of 17 Hospitals in Florida. Each of them shared with the audience their personal journey to become successful in their professional careers.\n\nSmirti Irani shared with the audience where she broke many glass ceilings and rose to the top of the political and Bollywood world. “I am honored to be part of the panel of trail blazing women.” She said, she was one of the youngest ever to be elected to the Rajya Sabha and Cabinet positions at the Federal Government. She was proud to have been honored by the World Economic Forum when it named me as a Young Woman Leader of the world.”\n\nSmiriti Irani highlighted India’s role in bringing women’s leadership to the world forum though its leadership of G 20. She said, “Women don’t have the problem of speaking up, but they have the problem of being heard.” She said, “Women’s values cannot be measured by their success, she needs to be evaluated by what she is.” She paid homage to physicians of Indian origin “for your great contributions” and urged that “AAPI celebrates where every voice of women is celebrated.”\n\nYoung Yoshita Singh shared about the journey she made from India to the UN. “You learn everyday as there is new everyday. I have seen the sea change in multilateral and bilateral relationships with USA.”\n\nDr. Soumya Vishvanathan said, “I am honored to be part of the powerful panel. It’s not about women, but people’s development. An internal medicine physician in New England, she decided to take on leadership roles and rose to the top of the ladder today. She said, “With a well-rounded education and belief that I am ready to take on this leadership role leading 17 hospitals across Florida, where our system wise focus on training young physicians.”\n\nWhile congratulating the members of AAPI’s Women’s Forum, Dr. Anajana Samadder, President of AAPI said, “From birth to death, all of us need women in our lives. They sacrifice their lives for the rest of the family, society, and the world at large.

Some might point to Kubaba, a tavern keeper who supposedly ascended to the throne of Sumer around 2400 BCE. If true, she would be the first documented female ruler in human history, but this claim is likely mythical. More concrete evidence supports the claim of Sobekneferu, who reigned as a pharaoh in ancient Egypt from around 1760 to 1756 BCE. However, whether she was truly the first female ruler of a significant civilization remains uncertain.\n\nThroughout recorded history, numerous women have ruled despite living in male-dominated societies. These women achieved unparalleled power, overcoming significant societal disadvantages. Here are some of the most powerful women rulers in history, including Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nHatshepsut\n\nHatshepsut assumed power in 1479 BCE as the regent for her stepson (and nephew) Thutmose III, who was only two years old at the time. For almost seven years, Hatshepsut was a conventional regent. However, she then took the unprecedented step of assuming both the title and powers of a true pharaoh, ruling Egypt alongside Thutmose III. To assert her authority, she had herself depicted as a man in formal portraits, with a muscular male body, traditional kingly regalia, and a false beard. Hatshepsut became one of the first truly powerful female rulers known to history. Her reign brought about economic prosperity and peace, and she was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt’s history.\n\nZenobia\n\nZenobia ruled the Roman colony of Palmyra (in present-day Syria) from around 267 to 272 CE. During her short reign, she posed a significant threat to the Roman Empire. After her husband Odaenathus and his eldest son Herodes were assassinated, Zenobia took the throne. Unlike her husband, she defied the Roman Emperor Aurelian and seized control of almost the entire eastern part of the empire, including Egypt. Aurelian could not ignore Zenobia’s growing power and marched on Palmyra with his entire army. Zenobia was captured and taken to Rome in chains. Historians differ on her fate; some say she starved herself to death or was beheaded, while others believe she was acquitted at trial, married, and lived the rest of her life in Rome.\n\nTheodora\n\nBorn in the fifth century CE in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), Theodora came from a lower social class. As a young woman, she worked as an actress, a job equated with prostitution at the time. She later moved to Egypt, where she converted to Miaphysite Christianity. Upon returning to Constantinople, she met Justinian, the heir-apparent to the Byzantine Empire. Captivated by her beauty, vibrancy, and intelligence, Justinian made her his mistress, and they married in 525 CE. Two years later, Justinian became emperor, and Theodora ruled as his intellectual and political equal. Many believed she was the true ruler of Byzantium, overseeing significant reforms, including construction projects and new laws. She fought for the persecuted and recognized women’s rights, establishing laws to protect prostitutes, giving women more power in divorce cases, and abolishing a law allowing women to be killed for adultery.\n\nWu Zetian\n\nEmpress Wu Zetian, also known as Wu Zhao, was the first and only female emperor of China. At 14, she joined the royal court as an imperial concubine of Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty. After Taizong’s death, she began a relationship with the new emperor, Gaozong, with whom she had four sons and one daughter. She served as empress consort and, after Gaozong’s death, as empress dowager. Wu then founded her own dynasty, ruling as emperor from 690 to 705 CE. Despite opposition, she eliminated rivals, including relatives. As empress, she was both feared and respected, governing well and employing able advisers. By the end of her reign, China had become a formidable force. Wu Zetian’s legacy remains controversial due to her often extreme methods, including alleged brutal killings of her own family members, though the veracity of these accounts is debated.\n\nElizabeth I\n\nIn 16th-century Europe, the belief that women were unfit to rule was widespread, and Elizabeth I’s 44-year reign significantly challenged this notion. Imprisoned in the Tower of London by her half-sister, Queen Mary I, Elizabeth ascended to the throne of England in 1558. The kingdom she inherited was small and threatened by internal divisions. However, Elizabeth transformed and unified the nation, ushering in the golden Elizabethan age, during which arts and sciences flourished, and England became a global force. Elizabeth chose not to marry, earning the moniker the “Virgin Queen,” partly to maintain her power. She famously defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, declaring, “I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.”\n\nCatherine the Great\n\nRussia’s Catherine II, known as Catherine the Great, came to power by overthrowing her husband, Peter III. After his death, Catherine became an effective ruler, surrounding herself with capable advisers, some of whom, like Grigory Potemkin, were her lovers. She expanded Russia’s borders, incorporating Crimea, Belarus, Lithuania, and much of Poland. A patron of the arts, literature, and education, Catherine led Russia into a new era of political and cultural engagement with Europe, embracing Enlightenment principles and attracting Europe’s greatest minds to her court.\n\nCixi\n\nEmpress Dowager Cixi is often viewed as a cruel tyrant, though her exact actions remain debated. Nevertheless, she was one of the most powerful women in Chinese history. Entering the late Qing dynasty’s court as a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor, she bore him a child. Upon the emperor’s death in 1861, Cixi became co-empress dowager and later took control by installing her nephew as the Guangxu emperor, ruling as regent. She held supreme power over the empire for 40 years until her death in 1908. Her rule was marked by political killings and a turbulent period, including the Boxer Rebellion and foreign invasion. Cixi’s legacy is a complex reminder of how power can corrupt.\n\nDr. Kavita Gupta Elected Chair Of AAPI Board of Trustees\n\nDr. Kavita Gupta made history as the first-ever physician who was born and raised in the United States, a second-generation Indian American physician to hold a national leadership position in the 44-year-old history of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI). Dr. Gupta was elected Secretary of National AAPI in 2013. Now, a decade later, she has been elected as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of AAPI.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Gupta is serving a 3-year term on the powerful Board of Trustees of AAPI. She will assume charge as the Chair of AAPI’s BOT during the first-ever World Congress of AAPI in New York on July 20th, 2024.\n\n“I want to congratulate Dr. Kavita Gupta for representing second-generation Indian American physicians in this very important role as the BOT Chair of AAPI,” said Dr. Anjana Samadder, current President of AAPI. “With her election to the leadership role in AAPI, the second and successive generations of physicians of Indian Origin at AAPI are poised to continue the tremendous success of our prior leadership and contribute our dynamic talents towards AAPI’s mission.”\n\nRecognizing the need to bring in more second-generation Indian American physicians to AAPI, Dr. Gupta says, “We have to grow with the next generation by its side. I see myself as a true liaison with our younger 2nd generation leaders.” Stating that she brings “a new perspective and also a second-generation rationale to the issues we face as Indian American physicians,” Dr. Gupta would like to see “my efforts go to slowly building a strong association focusing on younger leader development and strengthening our professional relations.”\n\nWith nearly three decades of excellence and dedicated service to the causes of physicians of Indian origin in the United States, Dr. Kavita Gupta is embarking on her new role, bringing in a wealth of experiences and vision fortified with infectious zeal, and unwavering courage. A woman leader in a predominantly men’s club, Dr. Gupta’s motivation for joining AAPI was that “AAPI needed young charismatic leaders that had the service and leadership qualities needed to unite and bring Indian physicians to new levels in American society.”\n\nDr. Kavita Gupta is board-certified in pain management, physical medicine, and rehabilitation. A prominent practicing pain management physician from the southern New Jersey Tri-state region, Dr. Gupta had started as an engineer but pursued a medical degree “with a mindset to help others.”\n\nDescribing her long years of medical practice, Dr. Gupta says, “I’ve been in practice as an interventional pain management for over 20 years, ranging from academic practice and private practice.” Before becoming a physician, Dr. Gupta had a Master’s degree in biomedical engineering from the prestigious Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York and had participated in consulting and advisory roles with pharma, device companies and was mentoring biomedical engineering graduate students.”\n\nAfter graduating from medical school, Dr. Gupta completed her post-graduate training as a chief resident in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Temple University and completed an anesthesia pain fellowship at Penn State. Previously, Dr. Gupta was an assistant professor and section head of the Interventional Pain Program at UMDNJ Stratford. She has contributed to the publication of several articles and participates in clinical research within the field of pain management. Dr. Gupta lectures nationwide and has a special interest in community education programs on the latest treatments to alleviate pain. She is an active member of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and teaching faculty at Rowan University.\n\nAs a student member of AAPI in 1994 Dr. Gupta founded MSRF Chapter at UMDNI, now Rowan/ Virtua, which has had tremendous growth and a robust presence on campus. Ever since she has been an active AAPI member for nearly three decades.\n\nDr. Gupta grew within AAPI nationally and locally while attending national and local Chapter meetings. She was elected national Vice President of MSRF, Treasurer of YPS, and later on as YPS president. She has been active in the Philadelphia Indian Physician organization, serving as its Secretary and Vice President. She was elected and served as the national Secretary of AAPI in 2013. In addition, Dr. Gupta has served on various national AAPI Committees- from women’s forum/academic affairs /CME speaker/ convention committees and under several past presidents/convention teams.\n\nWhile working towards expanding AAPI’s mission statement to include diversity with the senior visionary members and prospective physicians from abroad and the US, Dr. Gupta wants to “enhance our networking within political arenas, amongst specialty organizations, while embracing technology and media to echo our voices to local and international medical communities.”\n\nThe BOT and in her capacity as the Chair, Dr. Gupta says, “We have the responsibility to oversee the financial sustainability of the organization and its future financial growth. As a group, we can monitor the financial health of the organization and accordingly provide our recommendations. BOT has a variety of esteemed leaders that will assist to provide their perspectives to the Board relevant to financial health of our organization.”\n\nDr. Gupta says, “It’s important to recognize and adapt to the differences of each administration style while preserving the mission of AAPI. We have to continue to inspire younger leaders within AAPI to continue to remain committed and have a purposeful meaning as to why to stay connected and be supportive.”\n\nWhile describing the challenges, Dr. Gupta says, “The change of administration, which is yearly, and their vision for the organization, budget planning can also vary. BOT will need to be adaptable to each new administration, yet diligent with oversight of financial operations within AAPI.”\n\nDr. Gupta has been an active community leader within the local Indian community, local physician community as well as serving on a variety of board positions in her township, county, and other national non-profit organizations, helping with creating and advising on programs for the community, fundraising, speaking engagements on preventative healthcare and wellness.\n\n“My passion has been in educating the youth and participating as a judge and advisor for several youth organizations focused on science, research, public speaking, and medical student education,” she says. Dr. Gupta believes “in empowering the youth, staying involved as an educator ever since my residency career and I am currently educating medical students, graduate students and resident physicians. I enjoy in participating healthcare education platforms for the community and have done many such programs locally, via telehealth, and abroad. I have been a youth advisor for non-profit organizations, high school clubs, and professional development programs.”\n\n“I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, collaborators, and individuals who share a passion for advancing healthcare. Whether you have a collaborative opportunity, insights to share, or simply want to connect, I look forward to engaging with you and contributing to the collective success of our healthcare community.” Dr. Lokesh Edara the outgoing Chair of AAPI has worked with Gupta in the past prior to joining BOT on collaborating on project ideas to support the medical students and pre-med students.\n\nMany senior leaders within the organization have congratulated and encouraged her growth within AAPI. As they say, “Rome wasn’t built in a day”, through triumphs and turmoil we will continue to learn how to better AAPI with collaboration with everyone, especially our young leaders.\n\nAAPI members give selflessly of their time to work in underserved areas. AAPI provides extraordinary support to India through the activities of its Charitable Foundation and the Global Healthcare Summit, Dr. Gupta says. According to her, “As Indian physicians in the United States. it is our duty to nurture our present home as well as our ancestral home. AAPI needs young charismatic leaders who have the service and leadership qualities AAPI leadership has always recognized that the future of AAPI is with the second generation.”\n\nEvery year, a lot of youngsters are joining this profession. “They need community support for setting up their practices, guidance from senior specialists, networking and much more. They should be given more privileges when they join. We want to instill dynamism, and leadership qualities in the next generation of physicians so that they are better equipped to face future challenges head-on. They are our future,” Dr. Gupta says.\n\nWhen she is not seeing patients, Dr. Gupta enjoys time with her triplets and husband, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. She gives full credit to her family for supporting her at every step of the way. I have very good friends in AAPI, who have full confidence in me and I can trust them to guide me through all stages in leading AAPI.”\n\n“Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working in various healthcare settings, honing my expertise in teaching, medical management and clinical leadership. My journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence, with a focus on improving patient outcomes and fostering collaborative healthcare practices,” Dr. Gupta says.\n\nAAPI members represent a variety of important medical specialties.

Key indicators of adolescence, such as the onset of menstruation (age of menarche) and the commencement of breast development, are occurring progressively sooner.\n\nResearch indicates that American girls today begin menstruation up to four years earlier than girls a century ago. Recent data reveals that while girls born between 1950 and 1969 typically began menstruating at an average age of 12.5 years, this decreased to 11.9 years for girls born in the early 2000s. This trend is not limited to the United States but is evident globally. South Korean researchers, for instance, have noted a dramatic 16-fold increase in the number of girls showing signs of precocious puberty (either breast development or menstruation before age eight) between 2008 and 2020.\n\n“We’re also seeing that these decreasing ages at puberty are even more pronounced in lower socioeconomic status groups and ethnic minority groups,” says Audrey Gaskins, an associate professor at Emory University in Atlanta. “This has important implications for long-term health.”\n\nResearchers like Gaskins are particularly concerned that earlier puberty might trigger a cascade of events with significant consequences in adulthood. Data suggests it may shorten the fertility window, especially if these women enter menopause sooner, and could reduce overall lifespan. Precocious puberty has been repeatedly associated with a higher risk of diseases such as breast and ovarian cancers, metabolic syndromes like obesity and type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nScientists are still exploring the reasons behind these associations. Brenda Eskenazi, a professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, explains one theory: “There’s some theories that having a longer window of exposure to hormones increases risk for reproductive cancers,” suggesting that prolonged exposure to sex hormones like estrogen might elevate tumor development risks by stimulating cell growth.\n\nThere are also potential social consequences. Eskenazi points out that girls who enter puberty earlier are more likely to become sexually active sooner. “There’s a scary situation in the United States when we have the trend of abortion becoming illegal and contraception not being available,” she says. “It’s going to lead to more unwanted teen pregnancies, so that confluence of factors is very frightening.”\n\nThe question then arises: why is child development being accelerated in this manner?\n\nFrom Obesity to Air Pollution\n\nPuberty onset is regulated by two key communication networks in the body: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes. These connect the brain’s hypothalamus, which regulates essential functions from hunger to temperature control, with hormone-secreting glands.\n\nGaskins notes that until recently, childhood obesity was considered the primary cause of premature puberty, with proteins produced by fat cells (adipokines) stimulating the HPA and HPG axes. “It’s only recently that people have been like, ‘Oh that doesn’t explain it all, and there have to be other factors involved,'” she says.\n\nRecent studies, however, have identified another surprising cause: air pollution. Much of this research has emerged from South Korea, where cities like Seoul, Busan, and Incheon rank among the world’s most polluted. A review from Ewha Womans University in Seoul highlighted a consistent relationship between exposure to various pollutants and earlier puberty onset.\n\nToxic gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone, released through vehicle emissions or industrial waste, are major culprits. A 2022 study in Poland, a country with significant air quality issues due to coal-burning factories, linked higher exposure to nitrogen gases with menstruation beginning before age 11.\n\nAn even greater concern is fine particulate matter (PM), tiny particles from sources like construction sites, wildfires, power plants, vehicle engines, and unpaved roads. In October 2023, Gaskins and colleagues found that U.S. girls exposed to high levels of PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) and PM10, both in utero and during childhood, were more likely to start menstruating earlier.\n\n“PM2.5 particles can enter the bloodstream pretty readily,” Gaskins explains. “You inhale them into your lungs, and they’re not filtered out like some of the bigger particles would be, and they can then reach different organs. We’ve seen certain PM2.5 particles accumulating in the placenta, fetal tissues, the ovaries, they can get everywhere.”\n\nStudies have shown that chemicals within these fine particles can interact with hormone receptors involved in development, particularly androgen and estrogen receptors, potentially triggering a chain reaction leading to puberty.\n\n“That was our primary hypothesis, that the girls who had higher exposure to PM2.5 were also exposed to more chemicals that were either mimicking estrogen or just generally disrupting that HPA axis and its regular signals, prompting the body to go into puberty earlier,” says Gaskins.\n\nMultiple factors likely contribute to premature puberty. Gaskins suggests that evidence related to PM2.5 and other pollutants is one example of how harmful environmental chemicals can infiltrate the body, causing significant hormonal changes.\n\n“Pre-pubertal girls are an interesting group because another major route of exposure to chemicals which disrupt hormonal processes is through personal care products,” she says. “And there’s now a lot of companies actively going after that demographic and marketing products to them.”\n\nEskenazi adds that there is much we still don’t understand about the complex interplay between our changing environment and child development. Factors such as microplastics and climate change also remain largely unexplored. “I think we’re still just at the tip of the iceberg,” she says. “We don’t know how a hotter climate is affecting the menstrual cycle or even the role of social factors, pressurizing girls to grow up sooner. But this trend is very real, and it could be a multifactorial combination of environmental chemicals, obesity, and psychosocial issues which are combining to lower the age of menarche.”\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum: Mexico’s First Female President\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum’s Background and Achievements\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, known as “la Doctora” for her impressive academic background, is a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering. She has served as the former mayor of Mexico City, one of the world’s most populous cities, and was part of the United Nations panel of climate scientists that received a Nobel Peace Prize. She made history by becoming the first woman and the first person of Jewish heritage to be elected president of Mexico, winning around 60% of the vote in the largest election in Mexico’s history.\n\nSheinbaum’s academic career includes receiving the prize of best UNAM young researcher in engineering and technological innovation in 1999. She also joined the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at the United Nations, contributing to reports on the topic “Mitigation of climate change” and co-authoring the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report in 2013. She has been dedicated to university teaching, focusing on renewable energy and climate change.\n\nChallenges Ahead for Sheinbaum\n\nOne of the challenges Sheinbaum faces is to establish her own platform gradually while initially acting as a faithful disciple of her longtime ally, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. She will need to navigate the transition carefully, offering glimpses of her own program without stoking instability in the movement’s base. Despite her close association with Obrador, there are clear differences between the two leaders, with Sheinbaum emphasizing her decision-making based on data and science.\n\nAnother significant challenge for Sheinbaum is addressing Mexico’s organized crime and security issues. The country has been plagued by high levels of violence, with a soaring homicide rate and a significant number of people missing. Additionally, Mexico remains a dangerous place for women, with high femicide rates. Sheinbaum will need to act quickly on these pressing security issues.\n\nUS-Mexico Relations\n\nSheinbaum’s presidency comes at a critical time for US-Mexico relations, as both countries are holding elections in 2024. Mexico is a key US ally on various issues, including trade, drug trafficking, and migration management. The relationship between President Joe Biden and Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been described as friendly and professional, and the Biden administration anticipates a productive relationship with Mexico’s next president.

Peace begins with all of us in our beautiful diversity!” she added.\n\nEstablished in 2016 by the office of military affairs within the department for peace operations (DPO) of the UN, the United Nations military gender advocate of the year award acknowledges the dedication and efforts of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security.\n\nThe recipient of the award is chosen from among nominees put forward by force commanders and heads of mission from all peace operations. India currently stands as the 11th largest contributor of women military peacekeepers to the United Nations.\n\nAnasuya Sengupta Makes History as First Indian Actress to Win Best Actress at Cannes Film Festival, Signaling India’s Rising Influence on Global Cinema Stage\n\nIn a groundbreaking and historic occurrence, Anasuya Sengupta has made history by becoming the inaugural Indian actress to clinch the esteemed Best Actress accolade at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe extraordinary feat was attributed to her exceptional portrayal in ‘The Shameless,’ a compelling cinematic piece vying for recognition in the Un Certain Regard segment of the 77th iteration of the festival.\n\nUpon accepting the award, Anasuya fervently dedicated her triumph to various marginalized communities worldwide, especially the queer community, expressing, “This is for the queer community everywhere, and all other marginalized communities all over the world, for bravely fighting a fight they shouldn’t have to fight.” She further emphasized the significance of embracing the female perspective in cinema, stating, “More female gaze is the way forward, and the browner the better.”\n\nThe 77th Cannes Film Festival stood as a momentous occasion for India, with Anasuya’s historic win setting the stage.

The competition took place at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay.\n\nDuring the final stage, when the competition was down to the top five contestants, Manalo was asked how she would leverage her beauty and confidence to empower others.\n\n“As a woman of color, I have always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, actually,” she explained, adding that she was taught to “believe in my mother, to always believe in yourself, uphold the vows that you have.”\n\n“Because of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now,” she said, gazing out to the packed arena.\n\nManalo’s victory sparks a broader discussion about diversifying beauty standards in the Philippines, a country where Western ideals have long been influential, partly due to its colonial history.\n\nLighter-skinned actors and models often dominate TV shows, movies, and fashion campaigns. Additionally, skin lightening treatments and products are widely used, as is common in other Asian countries.\n\nManalo, who started modeling at 14, spoke about her own insecurities growing up in a YouTube video on Empire Philippines, which livestreamed the event.\n\n“I grew up having insecurities as I was always bullied because of my skin and my hair type,” she said, crediting her friends and family for helping her “realize that I am beautiful in my own extraordinary way.”\n\nManalo will represent the Philippines at the Miss Universe pageant in Mexico this September.\n\nShe aims to secure the fifth title for the Philippines, following the wins of Gloria Diaz in 1969, Margie Moran in 1973, and Pia Wurtzbach in 2015 (after host Steve Harvey initially announced the wrong winner). Catriona Gray was the last Filipino to win the title in 2018.\n\nMore than 100 countries will participate in Miss Universe 2024. This year, the competition will eliminate the upper age limit previously set for contestants, who had to be between 18 and 28 years old.\n\nThe Miss Universe organization has faced scrutiny recently, as the parent company of the Miss USA organization. Both Miss USA and Miss Teen USA resigned earlier this May amid allegations of mismanagement, a toxic work environment, and conditions that affected their mental health.\n\nAsia Society Honors Five Extraordinary Women at Asia Arts Game Changers Gala\n\nAsia Society New York hosted the annual Asia Arts Game Changer Awards on May 16th, 2024, recognizing five exceptional female artists and architects for their contributions to artistic environmental activism. “Through work spanning art, architecture, design, and more, they have expanded how we understand art, history, culture, and identity. Each artist has carved out a unique space for their art, but what is shared is their commitment to the environment,” remarked Asia Society President and CEO Dr. Kyung-wha Kang.\n\nAsia Society Museum Director Yasufumi Nakamori kicked off the awards ceremony, noting the ingenuity of this year’s honorees: “Their meticulous research on a wide range of subjects from climate to building structures transform what we understand as art and architecture today. Through their work we are made aware of how the climate crisis affects the world.”\n\nWhen presenting artist Rina Banerjee with one of the five 2024 Asia Arts Game Changer awards, art historian Joan Kee said that “beholding one of Banerjee’s works is like holding a galaxy of information.” Banerjee creates multi-faceted sculptures, paintings, and drawings. As a trained artist and an engineer, she often uses antiques alongside synthetic material like plastic to highlight the legacies of colonialism. In Banerjee’s own words, her work shows how “what can become beautiful and grotesque becomes blurred,” highlighting “how vulnerable our world really is.”\n\nArtist Minouk Lim was honored for what curator Lauren Cornell calls “an ability to turn memory into material and find new ways to understand the present.” In her art, Lim uses non-traditional organic ingredients, like squid bones, that people would otherwise not come into contact with. “Words like climate emergency and climate degradation are too abstract, so I try to bring them into my work and make them concrete,” said Lim.\n\nArchitect and artist Maya Lin is known for her remarkable memorials that bridge art and history, the first of which was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. “If I can present the facts, you will come away with another way of seeing the future,” shared Lin, explaining how her memorials focus on more than just loss.\n\nHer fifth memorial, What is Missing?, is a cross-platform, global memorial to the planet that calls attention to the crisis surrounding biodiversity and habitat loss. An interactive presentation from What Is Missing is currently on view in Asia Society Museum’s COAL + ICE exhibition. “Someone once asked me ‘as far as the environment is, am I optimistic?’ and I just want to say, we have no choice but to be wildly optimistic,” said Lin as she accepted her award.\n\nArchitect Toshiko Mori has worked on a broad range of award-winning architectural programs across the world, including urban, civic, institutional, cultural, residential, and museum design. When presenting her with the Arts Game Changer Award, Asia Society Trustee Betsy Cohen remarked on Mori’s renowned work for the Brooklyn Central Library. “The element that stands out to me from Toshiko’s professional career is the way in which she translated an idea on paper into something that is beloved by the community that frequents the institution,” said Cohen.\n\nThe final award of the evening was presented to artist Anicka Yi, who has produced a unique body of work that blurs the lines between what is human, animal, plant, and machine. Yi says she fuses “ancient wisdom with contemporary paradigms to better contribute to our planet.” Curator Lydia Yee, who presented the Asia Arts Game Changer Award, praised Anicka for her ability to explore complex questions like ‘what does climate change smell like?’ “She invites us to break free from behavioral patterns that are changing our ecosystem,” said Yee.\n\nThroughout the evening, guests could bid on auction items that were on display from artists Francesco Clemente, Vibha Galhotra, Jitish Kallat, Yayoi Kusama, Christian Marclay, Hiroshi Sugimoto, and Sara VanDerBeek. The auction, made possible through a partnership with Artsy, will be open through May 21, 2024.\n\nWomen Who Win Summer Summit: Empowering Voices, Fostering Inclusion\n\nThe upcoming Women Who Win Summer Summit, set to take place at the Academy of Creative Arts in Burlington, Massachusetts on June 2nd from 1 PM – 5 PM, promises to be a remarkable event fostering inclusivity and empowerment within the community.

The Women Who Win team eagerly anticipates welcoming attendees on June 2nd for an enriching and impactful summit.\n\nMilitant Hindutva and Gender: The Rise of Aggressive Female Mobilization in India’s Right-Wing Politics\n\nSavarkar’s call for the “militarisation” of the “Hindu race” is deeply intertwined with the promotion of masculinity as a fundamental aspect of Hindutva. This vision encompasses the creation of a macho warrior figure whose existence relies on aggression against perceived enemies. Such a warrior is driven by the desire to avenge “historical wrongs” and views every non-Hindu as a potential adversary unless they atone for the alleged crimes of their ancestors by accepting punishment. This ideology fosters the belief that no Hindu, particularly if a Brahmin, can ever be a “terrorist,” and must always be seen as virtuous.\n\nIn his essay “Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History,” Savarkar criticizes Buddhism for its teachings of non-violence and universal brotherhood. He underscores the “necessity of creating a bitter sense of wrong” and promoting “political and masculine virility” to combat what he saw as India’s passive acceptance of aggression under the influence of Universalism and nonviolence. This idea of instilling a perpetual sense of grievance is evident in current efforts to rewrite Indian history as a continuous conflict between Hindus and Muslims.\n\nRSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, in an interview with the Organiser, remarked, “Hindu society has been at war for over 1,000 years… [I]t is but natural for those at war to be aggressive… [T]his war is not against an outside enemy, but against an enemy within. So there is a war to defend Hindu society, Hindu Dharma and Hindu culture…” This perspective implies that women from the “other” community become easy targets to demonstrate “masculine virility.” The masculinisation of Hindutva, inherently violent, impacts how the movement mobilizes women.\n\nIn the drive towards a majoritarian India, women’s mobilisation serves two key purposes. Firstly, it involves women’s direct participation in aggressive Hindutva activities. Secondly, it reinforces the traditional role of the family, with women as ideal wives and mothers within Hindutva’s cultural-nationalist narrative. The Rashtra Sevika Samiti, established in 1936, aims to fulfill both roles.\n\nAcross the globe, right-wing politics often associates with the stereotype of passive women. However, women’s movements for social change have influenced right-wing structures, leading to the emergence of women leaders in these movements. Such leaders, in various contexts, propagate hate, defend traditional roles, and participate in aggressive mobilizations. In the US, women in white supremacist movements, and in Europe, those involved in anti-immigrant campaigns, mirror this trend. In Islamist societies, women leaders committed to fundamentalist ideologies defend the subordinate role of women as per patriarchal religious interpretations. In India, anti-minority hate speeches and lynching mobs often see leadership from right-wing women, backed by powerful patrons.\n\nDuring the 1990s, around the Babri Masjid demolition, women like Sadhvi Rithambara and Uma Bharti spearheaded anti-Muslim campaigns with vehement abuse. Since then, other women leaders have followed suit. Their rhetoric combines hate against targeted communities, a sectarian nationalism, and the glorification of traditional female roles through male-centric rituals. Recently, young women have been trained in using weapons, showcased during religious festivals like Ram Navami in Bengal, where young girls wielded swords and chanted provocative slogans.\n\nIn Dharma Sansads, women deliver inflammatory speeches. Pragya Thakur, accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast, praised Gandhi’s assassin Godse and encouraged Hindus to keep weapons at home for self-defense. Despite her controversial statements, Thakur was elected on a BJP ticket and enjoys support from top party leaders. This emboldens other women in the Hindutva movement to seek prominence through similar hate crimes and speeches. A BJP Mahila Morcha office bearer in Uttar Pradesh, Sunita Singh Gaur, called for the gang-rape of Muslim women in a Facebook post. Though she was removed from her position after protests, she faced no prosecution for hate speech.\n\nIn a Dharma Sansad in Raipur in December 2021, Vibhanand Giri urged men to “rape and impregnate Muslim women” if Muslim men even glance at Hindu girls. Nupur Sharma, whose derogatory comments about Prophet Mohammed drew international attention, was eventually sacked by the BJP but received strong support from the Hindutva ecosystem and protection from legal action.\n\nWomen who align with militant Hindutva and advocate violence are far from empowered; they follow the directives of the Hindutva family. This holds true for prominent BJP women leaders in the Modi government who have never condemned such statements. They uphold the ideology, reinforcing the belief that aggression against minorities is justified and necessary.\n\nIn light of this aggressive mobilization of women, the RSS, under Mohan Bhagwat’s leadership, is considering direct membership for women in its centenary year. Bhagwat noted that although the Rashtra Sevika Samiti exists, many women are more inspired by the RSS and seek direct membership. This move does not aim to break the male bastion or address issues like patriarchy, dowry deaths, sexual assault, or domestic violence. Instead, it is intended to cultivate more women who will propagate hate within the Hindutva framework, aligning with the organization’s militant agenda.\n\nAIF Raises Over $4.2 Million at Record-Breaking New York Gala to Empower Women and Girls in India\n\nThe American India Foundation (AIF) has successfully raised over $4.2 million at its recent annual New York Gala held at Cipriani Wall Street. These funds are earmarked for AIF’s initiatives aimed at empowering women through job acquisition, financial literacy, maternal health, and careers in STEM. AIF collaborates with various levels of government—central, state, and local—to effectively implement its health, education, and livelihood programs.\n\nThe gala was hosted by Indian American comedian Zarna Garg and honored two notable individuals: Michael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard, and Falguni Nayar, founder and CEO of Nykaa, a prominent Indian beauty and wellness brand.\n\nRecognizing their outstanding contributions, AIF CEO Nishant Pandey stated, “Michael and Falguni are true exemplars of inspirational, passionate leaders who advance AIF’s mission to drive sustainable, social and economic change. We are ever grateful for their partnership and to the generosity of all our supporters, corporate and government partners, donors, and friends, thanks to whom, AIF has reached 18.88 million lives across 35 states and union territories of India.”\n\nDuring the event, Michael Miebach emphasized the beneficial collaboration between AIF and Mastercard, which has positively influenced over 220,000 Indian students through STEM education initiatives. “Our goal is to extend Girls4Tech to 500,000 girls across India by 2027, translating ideas into concrete actions,” Miebach said.\n\nFalguni Nayar unveiled a new three-year partnership between AIF and Nykaa focused on advancing STEM education for girls. “With India’s female literacy rate significantly trailing behind that of males, this collaboration seeks to provide girls with the resources to pursue their passions and dreams,” Nayar explained.\n\nThe gala also showcased compelling videos and speeches that highlighted AIF’s impactful work. The 2024 New York Gala, noted as AIF’s most successful to date, received major support from sponsors such as Goldman Sachs Gives, Mastercard, and Salesforce.\n\nWomen Who Win Announces Inaugural Summit: Empowering Leadership, Mental Health Advocacy, and Community Engagement\n\nWomen Who Win is gearing up for its inaugural summit on CEO Leadership, Mental Health, Male Allyship, Storytelling, and Community Connections, scheduled to take place on June 2, 2024, at the Academy of Creative Arts in Burlington, MA, running from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\n\nAccording to Co-Founder Dr. Manju Sheth, MD, the summit has been meticulously crafted based on input from their readership, focusing on the most compelling topics. “This event has been conceptualized solely based on the feedback from our readers, and the topics they are most interested in,” she stated, emphasizing the organization’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. “Diversity & Inclusion are at the core of Women Who Win, and we believe empowerment and educational forums are the key facets of that.”\n\nThe centerpiece of the event will be the keynote session titled “CEO Connection: Navigating C-Suite & Executive Realms,” where a distinguished panel of female leaders will share their invaluable insights and experiences in corporate leadership.

Clark, President & CEO of Boston Arts Academy Foundation & Commissioner – Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women; Priya Iyer, Chairman and CEO of Concertiv, and Dr. Maha Radhakrishnan, former CMO of Biogen. Rita Advani, a member of Women Who Win’s Advisory Board, will moderate the discussion.\n\nExpressing her enthusiasm, Co-Founder Dr. Deepa Jhaveri remarked, “We are honored and privileged to have these amazing women, community advocates and leaders in their fields talk about navigating to and within leadership at the C suite level, the impact they have had, their struggles and advice on the elusive work-life balance.”\n\nAnother focal point of the summit will be the “Mental Health & Wellbeing” session, led by Dr. Shalini Mansharamani, which aims to address the growing mental health crisis, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Dr. Mansharamani will facilitate a panel discussion featuring experts in psychiatry, therapy, and nursing, covering topics such as coping mechanisms for anxiety and depression, the influence of culture and family on mental health, and the role of cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nDr. Sheth emphasized the urgency of addressing mental health concerns, stating, “As a healthcare provider, I have seen how mental health issues have reached a crisis state and an all-time high, particularly post-pandemic.” She expressed optimism about the impact of the session in fostering ongoing dialogue and support.\n\nThroughout the afternoon, attendees will have the opportunity to engage with authors who have contributed to Women Who Win’s platform, as they share their personal journeys and insights. These sessions, led by Jharna Madan and Ruchika Yadav, will provide a deeper dimension to the stories featured online and in the organization’s recently released book.\n\nReflecting on the significance of these sessions, Co-founder Shaleen Sheth remarked, “We have shared 500+ stories on our website since we launched almost four years ago on our digital platforms and in our book. I am excited for these sessions to bring these beautiful and relatable journeys to the stage, and give them that extra dimension that the live in-person setting offers.”\n\nAdditionally, the summit will feature a panel discussion on “Male Allyship,” led by Preetesh Srivastava, highlighting the crucial role men play in advancing gender equity in both societal and corporate settings.\n\nAs part of its commitment to community engagement, the event will conclude with a “Meet the Community Organizations” session, providing local organizations with an opportunity to showcase their initiatives and recruit volunteers.

However, the recent back-to-back resignations of Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava have thrown the Miss USA organization into a maelstrom of controversy, shedding light on a purportedly dysfunctional environment and a culture of silence.\n\nVoigt, 24, representing Utah, and Srivastava, 16, representing New Jersey, departed from their roles citing personal reasons, yet behind their statements lies a narrative of discontent and disarray within the organization. Voigt’s resignation, ostensibly due to mental health concerns, hinted at deeper issues with her post spelling out “I am silenced” in its initial letters, suggesting a hidden message.\n\nThe Miss USA organization responded to Voigt’s departure with a statement emphasizing her well-being and the importance of self-prioritization. However, the organization’s silence on further inquiries raises questions about the extent of their awareness and accountability.\n\nVoigt’s resignation letter, obtained by CNN, detailed a litany of grievances, ranging from managerial incompetence to allegations of bullying and harassment by the organization’s CEO, Laylah Rose. Voigt described a toxic work environment and a lack of support, including instances of neglect regarding travel arrangements and prize package entitlements.\n\nDenise White, a PR representative for both Voigt and Srivastava, revealed that the contestants were bound by stringent non-disclosure agreements, preventing them from publicly elaborating on their reasons for resignation. Efforts to seek redress from the Miss Universe organization, which oversees Miss USA, proved fruitless, leaving the former titleholders unsupported in their struggles.\n\nThom Brodeur, Voigt’s pageant coach, lamented the unprecedented loss of both Miss USA and Miss Teen USA within a short span, signaling a crisis within the organization. Claudia Engelhardt, the former social media director for Miss USA, echoed these sentiments, citing a pervasive atmosphere of disrespect and mismanagement.\n\nEngelhardt’s account shed light on the turmoil within the organization, revealing a dwindling team size and a lack of infrastructure to support its operations effectively. She described an absence of contracts, onboarding processes, and guidance, painting a picture of chaos and neglect.\n\nVoigt’s ordeal, as described by Engelhardt, paints a stark contrast to the glamorous image associated with pageantry. Despite her title, Voigt allegedly had minimal public engagements, her potential squandered due to organizational mismanagement.\n\nIn a bid to restore stability, the Miss USA pageant announced Savannah Gankiewicz, the first runner-up to Voigt, as the new Miss USA 2023. Gankiewicz expressed her commitment to mental health awareness and unity within the pageant community, aiming to steer the organization towards a brighter future.\n\nWhile public figures, including former pageant directors, have rallied behind the resigned titleholders, Engelhardt and White advocate for greater transparency and accountability within the organization. They urge others to speak out against what they perceive as a stifling culture, hoping to initiate positive change and uphold the integrity of pageantry.\n\nSangita Jindal Appointed as Chair of Asia Society India Centre Board\n\nThe Asia Society India Centre Board has announced the appointment of Sangita Jindal, president, Art India and chairperson of the Jindal South-West Foundation (JSW) as its new Chair, effective from Apr. 1, 2024.\n\nExpressing delight at Jindal’s appointment, Asia Society India Centre CEO Inakshi Sobti said, “She has been an immense support to our mission in South Asia, and her work to support contemporary art in India and South Asia has been a transformative force.” Sobti expressed anticipation in working with Jindal to further strengthen the Asia Society’s presence in South Asia.\n\nSangita Jindal has led the JSW Foundation for two decades, overseeing its expansion into various areas such as education, health, livelihood creation, and conservation of arts and cultural heritage.\n\nNotable among her achievements is the establishment of the Jindal Arts In 1992 and later founded Art India, India’s premier art magazine, in 1994.

The association is planning a meaningful and colorful celebration to mark this significant milestone in its history.\n\nThe celebration will take place at Cotillion Caterers in Jericho, Long Island, as the base of the Association is in New York City and its suburbs. Dr. Anna George, the president of INANY and an Associate Professor at Molloy University, as well as a nurse practitioner at Northwell Health stated that individuals with proven expertise and leadership have been delegated to lead the planning, organization, and celebration of this event. Annie Sabu, a nurse practitioner at Northwell Health, is the Convenor, and Alphy Sundroop, a nurse educator at Nassau University Medical Center, is the Co-convenor.

Paul D. Panakal, an adjunct professor at Long Island University and a consultant at Northwell Health System, is the co-chair.\n\nINANY was founded in 2004 under the leadership of Dr. Aney Paul, the first Indian nurse ever elected to a legislature in the US. The association’s goal was to bring together the thousands of Indian nurses practicing in New York state and provide them with a unified voice in the mainstream and professional arenas. INANY has been collaborating with Grand Canyon University to facilitate tuition discounts for academic advancement. This has been instrumental in enabling scores of nurses to achieve Master’s and Doctoral degrees, further enhancing their skills and knowledge which in turn paved ladder to elevate their role responsibilities. Every year, the organization awards scholarships to nursing students in New York and India, supporting the next generation of healthcare professionals. Through its various initiatives, INANY has been instrumental in establishing the voice of thousands of Indian nurses practicing in New York state. The association’s efforts have helped to amplify the concerns and needs of this vital healthcare workforce, ensuring that they are recognized and supported in the professional arena. The association has been offering professional continuing education seminars for nurses. The continuing education credits are a requirement for nurses to recertify their specialty credentials. In addition, INANY has sent its teams to provide relief efforts in the Philippines, India, Haiti, and the southern United States after these regions were impacted by natural disasters. The organization has played a role in supporting recovery efforts in these areas. Other activities included organizing health fairs in Long Island, Queens and in upstate New York to help the under-insured or uninsured.\n\nAfter emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, there had been an unprecedented surge in anti-Asian hate incidents across the United States. INANY was awarded a grant of ten thousand dollars to engage in activities to mitigate the incidents. Recognizing this surge as a social health issue, INANY developed and conducted an evidence-based intervention training series known as “5D Bystander Intervention” to confidence to and empower possible bystanders to extend helping hands to victims. This was done in collaboration with the Coalition of Asian Children and Families.\n\nThe founding president Dr. Aney Paul and the visionary presidents that followed her – Sosamma Andrews, Usha George, Mary Philip, Tara Shajan, and the current president Dr. Anna George – and their low profiled but sincere and service-oriented leadership teams have been elevating INANY through progressive and transformational ladder. As an organization embodied by direct-care providing nurses, educators, administrators and executives, scientists, academia, and advanced practice nurses, INANY offers a strong presence in the healthcare of New York state. As a chapter of the National Association of Indian Nurses in America, INANY is also involved nationally. Recently NAINA conducted a comprehensive education program to educate nurses to defend against infectious diseases. This was done as part of a project under American Nurses Association in partnership with Center for Disease Control.\n\nNew York state governor Kathy Hochul and New York City mayor Eric Adams were among who appreciated the services of INANY.\n\nDr. Anna George said that the celebration will be taking place on May 4th together with the Nurses Week celebration.\n\nPaul D.

Alongside her entertainment career, she is sought after as a global strategist for her insights into international diplomacy and foreign policy. Upala, a Hindu, sees her various endeavors as harmonious, drawing inspiration from the multifaceted aspects of the divine feminine within her tradition.\n\nIn her words, “The goddess worship is so prevalent in our culture, but the goddess has many faces. There are many goddesses. It’s not just the devout wife or devotee, it is the fierce Kali or the Saraswati, who is all about knowledge.”\n\nShe emphasizes the concept of Shakti, the primordial cosmic energy embodying the divine feminine, which flows through all beings, manifesting in diverse forms. “That Shakti, the life force, moves through us and it shows itself in different forms,” Upala explains, reflecting on her own experiences.\n\nHindu women, like Upala, often seek guidance on modern feminism from ancient scriptures. “The beauty with Shakti is, she doesn’t need to give herself up in order to fight for space,” she says. “She holds her own, she knows her place, and no one’s gonna take that away from her. Her job is just to shine and be glorious.”\n\nThe concept of feminine power has deep roots in Hindu philosophy, with Shakti regarded as the force from which the universe emanates, akin to a nurturing mother birthing her children. Hindu theologian Rita Sherma elaborates on the dynamic nature of the feminine divine, which transcends gender binaries, encompassing attributes ranging from aggression to nurturing.\n\nSherma underscores the complementary relationship between masculine and feminine energies, emphasizing the importance of both. “The two are complementary binaries,” she explains. “The feminine divine is certainly dynamic and creative, even in gentle-appearing feminine divine like Radha.”\n\nLike Upala, Sherma experienced a career shift, attributing her transformation to the guiding force of Shakti. She advocates for the reclamation of scriptures such as the Devi Mahatmya, highlighting their empowerment of women throughout history.\n\nShakti Redding, a yogi and mystic psychologist, recounts her journey of embracing the feminine divine after encountering the Devi Mahatmya and Tantra philosophy. Renaming herself Shakti, she found solace and empowerment in reconnecting with nature and the divine feminine.\n\nReflecting on her personal struggles, including a terminated pregnancy, Redding emphasizes the healing power of Shakti, which enabled her to overcome grief and shame. She stresses the importance of acknowledging women’s collective experiences and potential for forgiveness and reconciliation.\n\nRedding elucidates the significance of the Tandava, the traditional dance of Shiva and Shakti, symbolizing the balance of feminine and masculine energies in life. She believes that understanding this balance is crucial for healing societal divides and fostering unity.\n\nUpala echoes Redding’s sentiments, advocating for a return to authentic expressions of masculinity and femininity rooted in Hindu principles. She emphasizes the need for men to embrace the divine feminine and support women’s empowerment.\n\nShe envisions a future where Hindu wo"
