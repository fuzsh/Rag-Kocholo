        "text": "Dear Ameeta and Suresh,\n\nI hope you're doing well.\n\nI would like to appreciate the continuous support provided by Komal Madeshwar. She always takes ownership of her work and proactively responds to the emails and calls even in the non office hours. For reference- Yesterday's cashless claim, she has supported till midnight which is highly appreciated for her immense dedication. Being a new joinee, she has picked up very quickly and proved herself that she has a zeal to learn and work hard which will help her to grow in her career successfully. So keep doing good work and I wish you all the best !!\n\nJyoti Bala\n\nAlyve Health\n\nDear Komal,\n\nI wanted to take this opportunity to provide a detailed feedback for Komal Madeshwar. I am a holder of the IIT Kanpur Alumni Group Policy for my parents and have been visiting Max Hospital (previously known as Sahara), Lucknow since January, 2024 for my mother’s treatment and dialysis.\n\nThe hospital is still struggling with the processes and the employees are not very proactive when it comes to serving their patients / clients. I have had multiple issues such as delayed claim submissions and approvals, or lack of responsibility/ownership on their part.\n\nIt was after a few weeks that I got the contact of Komal which was the true game changer. Komal has been exceptional in her responsibilities and has been thoroughly proactive in her deliverables. She is always available on phone and helps me liaise to understand if the hospital actually submitted the required documents and bills or not.\n\nThe prompt response and communication helps with a timely discharge for my mom, which otherwise after 4 hours of dialysis is an added pain to wait for approvals/discharge formalities.\n\nOverall, Komal has been a tremendous support who takes her work with utmost sincerity and delivers over and above her duties. She has always been responsive and even helped us while on leave/vacation. She has brought back a positive belief for me in the policy and she is definitely an asset for any organization.\n\nI want to thank Komal for her help and support and wish her the very best in her future endeavours\n\nHarsh Srivastava\n\nDear Komal,\n\nThanks a lot for your continuous support in getting my claims settled with minimum hassles. Timely payment really helps to manage the subsequent treatment bills. You must be dealing with so many patients but I really appreciate the way you listen patiently to my issues and get them addressed with urgency.\n\nI must say that in past one year my experience in dealing the mediclaim process with TPA like Paramount has been excellent. My sincere thanks to you for all your coordination with your backend team and seniors.\n\nKapil\n\nHi Sanvi,\n\nThank you so much for helping me with making my hospital experience so comfortable. I Really appreciate your patience when you came with me for my Mom’s cashless Dialysis papers & now with my dad hospitalisation. Love your dedication towards Your Job !!\n\nYou have attended to all my call at any time of the day & answered each & every bit of my queries with patience & understanding … appreciate every bit of your help !!\n\nA Big heartfelt thank you for always being there & making it easier for me to concentrate on well being of my parents … Your One liner “Don’t worry I will get it done\" brings a Big relief to me every time we speak ! Thanks Saima & Jimmy for helping as well !!! Feels like I got my back covered with you Guys watching out on everything going so smoothly !!!\n\nRenuka Hardasani\n\nRetail Administration | Management | Bestseller.com\n\nDear Mr. Abhishek,\n\nI am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional service you provided during my recent interactions with Paramount Health Services. Your professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care made a significant difference in my experience.\n\nFrom the moment I reached out, you were attentive, responsive, and went above and beyond to address my concerns and ensure that I received the best possible care. Your dedication and expertise were evident in every interaction, and I felt truly valued as a customer.\n\nThank you for your outstanding service. It is rare to find someone who combines such a high level of competence with genuine kindness and empathy. You have made a lasting positive impression, and I am grateful for your assistance.\n\nGanpat Koyande\n\nDear Jobin,\n\nI hope you are doing well.\n\nI am Geetha, working at Deloitte, Hyderabad, as an Associate Director in T&T: ET&P - SAP Practice. In March 2024, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Since then, life has been a roller coaster, with four hospital admissions in the past two months for various treatments, from surgeries to radiations.\n\nThroughout this challenging time, the support I have received from the insurance team has been tremendous. Your team has been consistently available for my queries, and the claims processing has been incredibly quick—less than two hours for all four of my claims. It has never been a hassle for me. 🙂\n\nI truly appreciate the dedication and efficiency of your team. Their efforts have made a significant difference in my experience during this difficult period.\n\nGeetha Madhuri Bobbili,\n\nSAP Data & Analytics Associate Director | Deloitte South Asia LLP\n\nHi Santosh Pevekar,\n\nOn 11 Jan 2023 I underwent surgery before which I was approved with 4 lakhs of cashless amount. However after surgery I was approved 2.18 lakhs only. I escalated the issue with Pravin Jagtap how never helped me in anyway (Never answered my phone calls, Never replied my WhatsApp, etc.). He just dragged the issue with no resolution for several months!!!\n\nOur company insurance policy renewed and I came across with the new coordinator SANTOSH PEVEKAR. He proactively worked on my case and understood what am going through. I received the amount as below which I never expected from the insurance company.\n\nI literally appreciated his ethical work, expertise and dedication. I must say that SANTOSH PEVEKAR IS AN ASSET TO THE COMPANY!!!\n\nThank you so much Santosh Pevekar for your help and keep up the good work!\n\nKunal Sindroja,\n\nInteractive Brokers India PVT LTD\n\nHi Abhishek,\n\nThank you so much for your smooth services provided for the Claim No: 6702359.\n\nI am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional service provided by your team during my recent medical treatment.\n\nI must commend your team for their efficiency, professionalism, and dedication to ensuring a seamless experience for your policyholders. From the moment hospital team contacted customer service team to initiate the claim process to the final settlement of the claim, every step was handled with utmost care and attention to detail.\n\nThe entire process was remarkably smooth and hassle-free, thanks to the clear communication, prompt responses, and proactive assistance provided by your staff.\n\nPlease extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone involved in ensuring the success of the cashless claim process. Once again, thank you for your outstanding service. I look forward to continuing my relationship with your company and will not hesitate to recommend your services to others in need of reliable medical insurance coverage.\n\nRins John,\n\nAssociate Director | Risk Advisory| Cyber Risk Services | Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP\n\nHi Team Uttam,\n\nThis is an appreciation email for the insurance benefits that KPMG has provided its employees with and the Insurance team Uttam for the support they provided.\n\nI recently had an experience wherein I used this benefit and I can tell you it is one of the very good employee benefits that KPMG has provided us with. This insurance policy is very comprehensive compared to the what is available in the market.\n\nThis serves as a financial cushion in times of need for us and helps take off some burden in those tough times. Certain things I observed that stand out are:\n\nThe maternity cover amount is very good. You don’t get this cover or you get very less cover in the market.\n\nThe 0 waiting period is very helpful\n\nAll pre conditions are covered by default which helps cover individuals with certain past illness. Again market only covers some of these that also with waiting periods.\n\nWell baby charges are also covered in maternity.\n\nDay 1 coverage for new born again helps a lot. No policy in the market covers this. They only cover a new born from Day 91.\n\nDocuments collection, Information sharing and query resolution (via Phone and Email) support from the Insurance SPOCS Uttam has been very good. I even reached out to them on a Sunday for help and got it.\n\nThe claims (both cashless and reimbursement) were processed timely and with transparency of deductions.\n\nHimanshu Jain,\n\nKPMG\n\nHi Tanuja,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for your assistance throughout the claim refund process. Your support and prompt action made the entire procedure smooth and hassle-free for me. I am pleased to inform you that I have received the claim amount without any issues.\n\nYour professionalism and attention to detail truly made a difference, and I am thankful for your dedication in ensuring that everything was handled efficiently. Once again, thank you so much for your invaluable assistance. I genuinely appreciate your efforts and commendable service.\n\nVivian Paul,\n\nTeam Leader - Operations | Hexaware BPS\n\nHi Rahul / Haresh,\n\nI wanted to extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your invaluable assistance throughout my recent surgery process.

Your commitment to excellence has made a lasting positive impact.\n\nVaibhav Deshpande,\n\nSr. Director | Enterprise Architecture and Strategy | Gartner India\n\nDear All,\n\nThis mail comes as a special thanks to the entire Paramount team for their fast-track services on insurance -Pre auth to cashless to post hospital claims etc. A special mention to MS Jyoti Maurya for her unending support extended during my father’s hospitalization in last 1 year.

Experience) | Piramal School of Leadership, India.\n\nHi Suraj Balan,\n\nMy mom was recently diagnosed with 4th stage colon cancer and had to undergo a surgery at Jupiter hospital , Thane. It was an unplanned one and she had to be operated on in less than 24 hours to save her life.\n\nThe initial approval took very long and I had to pay 1.25 lacs as a deposit as Jupiter kept saying that Paramount was taking too long to send the initial approval. In the meantime, I reached out to Suraj Balan via my Senior HR manager, Nikita Sarangi and from then on, Suraj followed up and ensured that all approvals were given asap. He also stayed in touch with me during her stay and ensured that the final approval for discharge was given without delays.\n\nHe is also still in touch with me as her chemotherapy is ongoing and is always quick to respond to my messages and approvals. I would like to appreciate him and thank him for the same.\n\nI was disappointed with the time taken for initial approval though, it took almost 48 hours and there is definite scope for improvement as not everyone will be able to pay such a huge amount as a deposit failing which the hospital holds up critical surgeries.\n\n@Nikita Sarangi Thank you for your help and intervention as well.\n\n@Suraj Balan Thanks for your help & quick responses. She still has 4 more chemo sessions to go through and I am counting on your continued support.\n\nMs. Dawn Young,\n\nCommunications | Colgate\n\nDear Gagan,\n\nI trust this message finds you well.

Your dedication and professionalism did not go unnoticed, and I am truly grateful for your efforts.\n\nAdditionally, I want to extend my appreciation for your compassionate approach during a challenging time. Your availability for hospital-related inquiries and the genuine care you demonstrated were reminiscent of a supportive family member, providing much-needed comfort during the tough days of hospitalization for my mother.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your exceptional service and genuine concern. Your commitment to excellence has made a lasting positive impact.\n\nRegards,\n\nVaibhav Deshpande,\n\nSr. Director | Enterprise Architecture and Strategy | Gartner India\n\nDear Mahender,\n\nI am writing this mail to express my gratitude and appreciation for the support that you have provided me for my insurance process.
