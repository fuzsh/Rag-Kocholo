        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nThis article is about the city in Oakland County. For the township in Newaygo County, see Troy Township, Michigan.\n\nTroy is an affluent city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan, and is a suburb of Detroit. The population was 80,980 at the 2010 census, making it the 11th-largest city in Michigan by population, and the largest city in Oakland County. Troy has become a business and shopping destination in the Metro Detroit area, with numerous office centers and the upscale Somerset Collection mall.\n\nIn 2011, Troy was ranked the safest city in Michigan, as well as the 19th safest city in the nation. In 2008, Troy was ranked 22nd on a list of \"Best Places to Live\" in the United States [7] by CNN Money, using criteria including housing, quality of education, economic strength, and recreational opportunities. In 2008, Troy ranked as the fourth most affordable U.S. city with a median household income of approximately $79,000.[8][9]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe first land purchases in what became Troy Township were recorded in 1819 in section 19. The first settlement, known as Troy Corners, originated two years later when Johnson Niles purchased 160 acres (65 ha) in what is now the north-central portion of the city. Four years later, Ira Smith built the first house at Big Beaver Corners, and the first public school opened at Troy Corners. Troy Township was organized on May 28, 1827. The City of Troy was incorporated in 1955, mainly as a way to prevent neighboring cities (Clawson, Royal Oak, and Birmingham) from incorporating any more of its land into their cities.\n\nIn 1966, I-75 was completed in Troy, which increased access to and from the city. This gave a major boost to Troy's economy, leading to the development of its civic center, school district, and recreation system.\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.6 square miles (87 km2)—33.5 square miles (86.9 km²) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (0.30%) is water. The latitude of Troy is 42.605 N, and the longitude is 83.15 W. The mean elevation is 748 ft (228 m).\n\nClimate data for Troy, Michigan (48098) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 66\n\n(19) 65\n\n(18) 78\n\n(26) 87\n\n(31) 92\n\n(33) 102\n\n(39) 104\n\n(40) 101\n\n(38) 98\n\n(37) 90\n\n(32) 79\n\n(26) 64\n\n(18) 104\n\n(40) Average high °F (°C) 30\n\n(−1) 33\n\n(1) 44\n\n(7) 57\n\n(14) 68\n\n(20) 77\n\n(25) 82\n\n(28) 80\n\n(27) 73\n\n(23) 59\n\n(15) 47\n\n(8) 34\n\n(1) 57\n\n(13.9) Average low °F (°C) 15\n\n(−9) 16\n\n(−9) 23\n\n(−5) 34\n\n(1) 47\n\n(8) 57\n\n(14) 62\n\n(17) 59\n\n(15) 52\n\n(11) 40\n\n(4) 31\n\n(−1) 21\n\n(−6) 38.1\n\n(3.4) Record low °F (°C) −21\n\n(−29) −12\n\n(−24) −5\n\n(−21) 8\n\n(−13) 24\n\n(−4) 34\n\n(1) 41\n\n(5) 40\n\n(4) 31\n\n(−1) 19\n\n(−7) 2\n\n(−17) −11\n\n(−24) −21\n\n(−29) Precipitation inches (mm) 1.77\n\n(45) 2.02\n\n(51.3) 2.18\n\n(55.4) 2.75\n\n(69.9) 3.16\n\n(80.3) 3.25\n\n(82.6) 2.86\n\n(72.6) 2.88\n\n(73.2) 3.10\n\n(78.7) 2.97\n\n(75.4) 2.75\n\n(69.9) 2.20\n\n(55.9) 31.89\n\n(810) Source: The Weather Channel [10]\n\nCulture[]\n\nThe Troy Historic Village is a fully interactive historical museum chronicling the different stages of Troy's progression from its first settlers to the city it has become today. Located at the corners of Livernois Road and Wattles Road, the village is located behind the old city hall building. Open year round, the village has ten original, complete structures which patrons may enter and observe how they functioned in the past and how they were decorated, as all buildings are full of artifacts from that period. Each structure is original and was painstakingly moved from its original location to the museum intact. Starting with a log and mud structure used by the first settlers, there is also an 18th-century schoolhouse and estate, a general store, a blacksmith's shop, a church along with the pastor's home, and the old city hall, which acts as a general museum. There is a gazebo in the center of the square which will host parties and period bands during annual festivities. Many schools from around the area plan field trips to the museum, and the church is also available for weddings.[11]\n\nIn the summer of 2005, to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary, ceramic beaver statues, each standing four feet (1.2 m) high, were displayed at various locations in the city. The beaver is the symbol of Troy, and the city's main commercial thoroughfare (Big Beaver Road) is named after it.\n\nTroy is also home to two of the largest Protestant churches in the USA, Kensington Community Church and Woodside Bible Church.\n\nSports[]\n\nIn 2003, Troy was named Michigan's Sportstown by Sports Illustrated magazine for having the top community sports programs in the state.[12] Troy is home to the Troy Sports Center, which is the official training facility of the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL. The facility is also used for indoor soccer, hockey, and lacrosse leagues, and is home to the city's high school hockey teams.\n\nMedia[]\n\nIn addition to the Detroit News and Detroit Free Press, regional newspapers serving all of southeast Michigan, the city is served by the Daily Tribune[13] (published daily), the Observer & Eccentric[14] (which is published twice a week), the Troy Beacon [2](published every Thursday), the Troy Times,[15] and the Troy-Somerset Gazette [3] and, most recently, Troy Patch.[16] The Troy Eccentric newspaper edition ceased publication in 2009.[17]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nSee also: Pavilions of Troy and Economy of metropolitan Detroit\n\nTroy is a thriving center of business, particularly in the automotive and financial sectors, and is home to a number of major companies. Troy has the second highest cumulative property value in Michigan, second only to Detroit. Troy is home to the upscale Somerset Collection mall, featuring a skywalk and over 180 stores, and the Oakland Mall. The Top of Troy is the city's tallest building with offices of PNC Financial Services. Bank of America maintains a major operations center in Troy.\n\nPlanners have proposed the Pavilions of Troy project for the city, a landscaped square with boulevards lined with upscale shops, restaurants, offices, a theater, and condominiums.[18]\n\nIn 2012 Mahindra & Mahindra opened a technical center in Troy.[19]\n\nMajor companies[]\n\nFurther information: List of Michigan companies\n\nAltair Engineering\n\nAnchor Bay Entertainment\n\nBank of America (major center)\n\nBehr America\n\nBudd\n\nDelphi\n\nDuPont Automotive\n\nEntertainment Publications\n\nFlagstar Bank\n\nJ.
