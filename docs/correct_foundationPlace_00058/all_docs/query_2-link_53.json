Reflecting on the recent Indian elections, the Consul General said, \"India is a multicultural and diverse society where 714 million electoral votes were cast. A great transformation has taken place in India since 1985, and we've seen vibrancy in science and technology, and our growing middle class.\"\n\nParesh Patel, left, and Jay Madhu, right, receive the Businessmen of the Year honor from Santosh Govindaraju.\n\nAccording to Arora, there has been a heightened attention on Indo-U.S. relations in discovering each other. We are engaged democracies, he said. \"The sky's the limit for our relations. Despite the prevailing economic downturn, the Indian economy is healthy.\"\n\nINDOUS Chamber board member Santosh Govindaraju presented the following awards: Businessmen of the Year to Homeowners Choice Insurance founders Paresh Patel, Jay Madhu, Minesh Patel and Kris Persaud.

Rele received the Community Service Person of the Year honor. A 25-year veteran journalist with a Master's Degree from the University of Missouri School of Journalism, Rele has been active since INDOUS was formed in helping to promote their events in the local media, whether writing the story or press release or using his media contacts to get it published.

These three days of havans, prayers and religious activities filled the temple premises with deep sonorous sounds of spiritual chants from the Vedas. Twelve renowned priests performed the ancient, meaningful and appropriate rites and rituals.\n\nMore than a 1,000 devotees witnessed and participated in various religious activities such as Garuda Vahanotsavam, Sesha Vahanothsavam, Ratha Yatra, Sri Chandi, Sri Ganesha, Sri Vishnu and Sri Lakshmi havans.\n\nDr. Adinarayana Murthy Nallamshetty, chairman of Board of Trustees, encouraged community members to participate in Sahasra Kalasabhishekam, which brings purity and peace in people's lives and enhances prosperity and well-being of the community.\n\nFour years ago, the HSCF temple was inaugurated and the weeklong ceremonies brought people from India and across North America. This 4th anniversary celebration was a re-invocation of the purifying rites and to seek the blessings of Supreme God.\n\nAlong with spiritual events, various cultural programs and a youth exhibition, \"Yuv Kala,\" were held. The highlight was a musical performance by Anup Jalota with his live orchestra, which attracted more than 750 spectators.\n\nOn June 25, devotees participated in Sri Chandi Havan. This was followed by an Indian classical dance program and Garba. Mahendra Kapadia, president of the executive committee, was happy with the turnout for the programs. \"People of all generations and regions are very fond of the bhajans of Anupji,\" he remarked.\n\nThe event was made possible with the support of community members, priests, devotees and volunteers. HSCF BOT and Executive Committee members and Sahasra Kalasabhishekam core committee members expressed thanks to each and everyone who contributed to success of the event.\n\nFor more information on Sahasra Kalasa sponsorship, call (407) 699-5277.\n\nFor 2009, Ford has an all-new Sport version of the Edge. Overall ride and handling quality is excellent with the right amount of power for passing on city streets or the highway in the four-door, five-passenger crossover SUV.\n\nA 3.5-liter V-6 engine doles out 265 horsepower at 6250 rpm and 250 pounds-feet of torque at 4500 rpm. The 6-speed automatic transmission is slick and flawless. Tow capacity is a decent 3,500 pounds. Based on a unibody structure and exclusive to the Sport model are massive 22-inch wheels, dual exhaust and a body-colored kit, which includes a distinct front air dam, side skirts, lower door caps and a rear skirt.\n\nStaring in your face is a three-bar chromed grille and quad-beam headlights, aggressively raked windshield, fast-sloping back window, high-mounted spoiler, integrated fog lamps and a lower grille insert. Step into the cabin and the ambient lights that illuminate the foot wells and cup holders will catch your eye. Other notable standard features on the Sport model are Sync, which integrates Bluetooth-enabled cell phones and iPods through voice recognition, six-way power adjustable front seats and a 60/40 fold-flat rear seat.\n\nIf you are in the market for a crossover SUV, this Ford product would be a smart choice.

For a front-wheel-drive engine SUV, its handling and steering is remarkable even at tight corners and sharp turns.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 engine cranks out 262 horsepower at 6250 rpm and 248 pounds-feet of torque at 4500 rpm. The 6-speed automatic transmission is responsive to every move by the driver. The power rack-and-pinion steering conveys an exceptional on-center feel. The SUV feels firm and surefooted, thanks to a front MacPherson strut and a rear multilink independent suspension.\n\nBased on a steel unibody structure, the two-tone exterior shows off a chrome horizontal three-bar grille, door handles, mirrors and exhaust tips, horizontal-shaped HID headlights, chrome-bezeled fog lamps, rounded LED tail lamps, and signature side grooves. If you are looking for people-hauling practicality in your ride, the Flex fits the bill with its 155.8 cubic feet of room for passengers. Cargo space is a generous 83.2 cubic feet when the second- and third-row seats are folded flat. Also standard are a four-spoke tilt leather steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, 10-way power driver and 6-way front-passenger seats and ambient lighting.\n\nThe folks at Ford point out that the Flex is like nothing else on the road and defies being categorized. We couldn't agree more. A top-notch interior, bold-looking exterior and solid chassis make this SUV a smart choice.\n\nFORD FLEX SEL\n\nTires: P235/60R18\n\nWheelbase: 117.9 inches\n\nLength: 201.8 inches\n\nHeight: 68 inches\n\nWeight: 4,468 pounds\n\nFuel capacity: 18.6 gallons\n\nCity: 17 mpg\n\nHighway: 24 mpg\n\nBase price: $32,070\n\nWeb site: www.ford.com/flex\n\nTest-drive the Flex at Brandon Ford at 9090 Adamo Drive in Tampa.

The truth is that the recent rallies in the stock market have baffled all of us and left us looking hard for the answer to this frustrating question.\n\nThe market rally offers us hope while it lasts, but mere hope is not enough to recover the investment losses incurred over the past two years. The rising oil and commodity prices, along with higher interest rates are both troubling \"telltale\" signs that foreshadow even tougher times. And as if these problems are not enough, the massive stimulus packages do not seem to be working either, at least for now.\n\nSo where do we go from here? How do we reclaim our retirement? In this article, we will discuss a popular insurance product called the Variable Universal Life (VUL) that has been touted as an alternative retirement savings tool for years by many in the financial services industry. I know that the last thing people want to hear today is that they should buy another insurance product, but sometimes bad economic times are the best times for making investments, whether in the stock market, or even in depressed real estate; either of which can payoff big in the future.\n\nA VUL is a type of permanent life insurance whereby the death benefit is paid no matter if or when the insured dies, as long as there is sufficient cash inside the policy to cover for policy costs. VUL's flexibility allows the policyholder to select the timing and amount of payments within certain contractual framework. When a policyholder pays premiums, the insurance company deducts various costs and invests the rest of the money in separate accounts. Separate accounts allow the policyholder to invest the cash in several combinations of stock and bond funds set to a comfortable yet measured risk-preference. As long as the investments within the policy outperform the internal policy costs, the policy holder can come out ahead and guarantee himself a decent retirement income through tax free withdrawals.\n\nThe recent turmoil in the stock market, however, has wreaked havoc on the cash values within the VULs. The skeptics are absolutely right when they say that a market downturn can make a poorly designed policy virtually worthless. And it might take years before the cash values yield net positive returns and thereby make the policy assumptions true once again.\n\nThe depressed markets do offer a unique opportunity for certain investors to look into the VUL as a retirement vehicle. Does this mean that everyone should just go buy a new policy and pitch their 401(k), IRAs and other qualified retirement accounts? The answer is a vehement NO. VUL should only be considered as an option for retirement only after maximizing available alternatives for retirement.\n\nBefore you make a decision to buy a VUL, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of owning a policy. Important advantages of a VUL are flexibility of premiums and death benefit, tax-free investment earnings and tax-free withdrawals through policy loans. Some important disadvantages are that they are costlier than other types of life insurance, may lose value in bear markets or with bad investment choices and can be complex to understand and thereby set wrong expectations.\n\nWhether a VUL suits your retirement needs depends on your specific situation. It is vital to have a vigorous dialogue with your financial advisor to discuss the pros and cons of buying such a policy for the purpose of retirement planning. It is easy to get carried away by illustrations that show unrealistic linear returns over long periods of time. The stock market, as we all know, does not behave in a linear upward fashion. The last thing you want to do is throw good money in a bad strategy and expect a good outcome.\n\nAmol Nirgudkar, CPA, managing partner of Reliance Consulting LLC and a partner at Reliance Wealth & Trust Partners LLC, can be reached at (813) 931-7258 or email [email protected]"
