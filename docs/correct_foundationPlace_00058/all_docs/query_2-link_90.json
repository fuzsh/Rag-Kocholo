        "text": "The use of data to inform and drive business decisions has grown exponentially over recent years. It was not all that long ago that most companies utilized their data for little else than to create reports that summarized the past performance of their business. They looked backward and nothing more, if they looked at anything at all. Now, those same companies can use the same historical data, but viewed through the lens of the latest predictive modeling and analytics to foresee future risks, identify growth opportunities, detect fraud, optimize marketing campaigns, and provide the best assessment of myriad other aspects of business performance.\n\nPredictive data analytics are quickly taking hold across a variety of industries, from transportation to retail. Imagine, cities predicting congestion on specific bus routes and scheduling additional buses or a clothing store targeting a price for a particular customer based on their prior purchases. Some argue today’s advanced predictive analytics are so profound they are reinventing industries, and with the growing number of amazing real-world examples, that may not be such an outrageous claim.\n\nSyntelli has garnered real-world data analytics experience across a variety of industries, and we provide predictive analytics solutions tailored to the needs of your business. Below we discuss how we design and implement those solutions, and more importantly, how they will set your business apart from the competition.\n\nWe strive for predictive analytics solutions that are holistic, effective, and impactful. We begin by aggregating your data from everywhere we can find it — customers, vendors, suppliers — and using statistics and the science of probability to turn it into actionable business intelligence. From there, we contextualize each data point (a product SKU, a vehicle, a customer, an employee, a machine, etc.) to a broader dataset so that you can understand the patterns and trends occurring within your business. With that foundation in place, we can apply predictive analytics to measure credit risk, detect fraud, predict product sales, provide better healthcare, or design the specific solution your industry needs. The possibilities are virtually limitless!"
