        "text": "This article is about the city in Oakland County. For the township in Newaygo County, see Troy Township, Michigan.\n\nCity in Michigan, United States\n\nTroy is a city in Oakland County, Michigan, United States. It is located about 22 miles (35 km) north of downtown Detroit and is a northern suburb with the Metro Detroit area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 87,294, making it the most populous city in Oakland County and the 13th-most populous municipality in the state.[4]\n\nTroy was organized as a township in 1827, and sections of the township were later incorporated into the cities of Birmingham, Clawson, and Royal Oak. The remainder of the township was incorporated as the city of Troy in 1955.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest recorded purchases of land in what was known as Troy Township occurred in 1819. A couple of years later, a settlement known as Troy Corners was established due to Johnson Niles buying 160 acres in the region. The area is currently the north-central area of Troy. In 1827 Troy Township was established. In 1955, Troy was officially incorporated primarily as a strategy for preventing border cities from taking more land. This also helped to establish more robust city services for Troy residents, whose numbers increased rapidly during this time due to Detroiters fleeing the city for the surrounding suburbs.\n\nIt was named after Troy, New York, and the ancient city of Troy, as many of the early settlers, as in much of Michigan, originated from New York.[5]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.64 square miles (87.13 km2), of which 33.47 square miles (86.69 km2) is land and 0.17 square miles (0.44 km2) (0.51%) is water.[6]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 196019,402—197039,419103.2%198067,10270.2%199072,8848.6%200080,95911.1%201080,9800.0%202087,2947.8%2023 (est.)87,3390.1%\n\nAccording to a 2018 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $96,864, and the median income for a family was $113,640.
