INDOUS Chamber President Francis Vayalumkal welcomed the nearly 320 attendees, a sold out crowd.

This was Arora's first visit to Tampa. Reflecting on the recent Indian elections, the Consul General said, "India is a multicultural and diverse society where 714 million electoral votes were cast. A great transformation has taken place in India since 1985, and we've seen vibrancy in science and technology, and our growing middle class."

According to Arora, there has been a heightened attention on Indo-U.S. relations in discovering each other. We are engaged democracies, he said. "The sky's the limit for our relations. Despite the prevailing economic downturn, the Indian economy is healthy."

INDOUS Chamber board member Santosh Govindaraju presented the following awards: Businessmen of the Year to Homeowners Choice Insurance founders Paresh Patel, Jay Madhu, Minesh Patel and Kris Persaud. Founded in 2006, Homeowners Choice serves more than 65,000 policyholders throughout Florida.

Sonal Mashruwala of Ganesh Market in Tampa received the Businesswoman of the Year Award. A native of Ahmedabad, Mashruwala and her husband, Achut, opened the store (at 6204 N. Armenia Ave.) in 1996. The chamber noted that Mashruwala made sure that everyone who visited Ganesh Market felt comfortable shopping.

The 42-year-old creates an Indian home environment, finding time to pay special attention to each one of her customers.

The satisfaction he feels providing a valuable service to the community is motivation and reward.

The Hindu Society of Central Florida's temple in Casselberry celebrated its fourth anniversary by holding a Sahasra Kalasabhishekam, Brahmotsavam and Sri Chandi Havan from June 19-21. These three days of havans, prayers and religious activities filled the temple premises with deep sonorous sounds of spiritual chants from the Vedas. Twelve renowned priests performed the ancient, meaningful and appropriate rites and rituals.

More than a 1,000 devotees witnessed and participated in various religious activities such as Garuda Vahanotsavam, Sesha Vahanothsavam, Ratha Yatra, Sri Chandi, Sri Ganesha, Sri Vishnu and Sri Lakshmi havans.

Dr. Adinarayana Murthy Nallamshetty, chairman of Board of Trustees, encouraged community members to participate in Sahasra Kalasabhishekam, which brings purity and peace in people's lives and enhances prosperity and well-being of the community.

Four years ago, the HSCF temple was inaugurated and the weeklong ceremonies brought people from India and across North America. This 4th anniversary celebration was a re-invocation of the purifying rites and to seek the blessings of Supreme God.

Along with spiritual events, various cultural programs and a youth exhibition, "Yuv Kala," were held. The highlight was a musical performance by Anup Jalota with his live orchestra, which attracted more than 750 spectators.

On June 25, devotees participated in Sri Chandi Havan. This was followed by an Indian classical dance program and Garba. Mahendra Kapadia, president of the executive committee, was happy with the turnout for the programs. "People of all generations and regions are very fond of the bhajans of Anupji," he remarked.

The event was made possible with the support of community members, priests, devotees and volunteers. HSCF BOT and Executive Committee members and Sahasra Kalasabhishekam core committee members expressed thanks to each and everyone who contributed to success of the event.

Call it boxy, different or bold but we have to admit that the seven-passenger 2009 Ford Flex SEL SUV is up to the job of tackling the rigors of daily driving. For a front-wheel-drive engine SUV, its handling and steering is remarkable even at tight corners and sharp turns.

The 3.5-liter V-6 engine cranks out 262 horsepower at 6250 rpm and 248 pounds-feet of torque at 4500 rpm. The 6-speed automatic transmission is responsive to every move by the driver. The power rack-and-pinion steering conveys an exceptional on-center feel. The SUV feels firm and surefooted, thanks to a front MacPherson strut and a rear multilink independent suspension.

Based on a steel unibody structure, the two-tone exterior shows off a chrome horizontal three-bar grille, door handles, mirrors and exhaust tips, horizontal-shaped HID headlights, chrome-bezeled fog lamps, rounded LED tail lamps, and signature side grooves. If you are looking for people-hauling practicality in your ride, the Flex fits the bill with its 155.8 cubic feet of room for passengers. Cargo space is a generous 83.2 cubic feet when the second- and third-row seats are folded flat. Also standard are a four-spoke tilt leather steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, 10-way power driver and 6-way front-passenger seats and ambient lighting.

The folks at Ford point out that the Flex is like nothing else on the road and defies being categorized. We couldn't agree more. A top-notch interior, bold-looking exterior and solid chassis make this SUV a smart choice.

At kitchen tables across America, the burning question is: What do we make of the American economy and when are things going to get better? The truth is that the recent rallies in the stock market have baffled all of us and left us looking hard for the answer to this frustrating question.

The market rally offers us hope while it lasts, but mere hope is not enough to recover the investment losses incurred over the past two years. The rising oil and commodity prices, along with higher interest rates are both troubling "telltale" signs that foreshadow even tougher times. And as if these problems are not enough, the massive stimulus packages do not seem to be working either, at least for now.

So where do we go from here? How do we reclaim our retirement? In this article, we will discuss a popular insurance product called the Variable Universal Life (VUL) that has been touted as an alternative retirement savings tool for years by many in the financial services industry. I know that the last thing people want to hear today is that they should buy another insurance product, but sometimes bad economic times are the best times for making investments, whether in the stock market, or even in depressed real estate; either of which can payoff big in the future.

A VUL is a type of permanent life insurance whereby the death benefit is paid no matter if or when the insured dies, as long as there is sufficient cash inside the policy to cover for policy costs. VUL's flexibility allows the policyholder to select the timing and amount of payments within certain contractual framework. When a policyholder pays premiums, the insurance company deducts various costs and invests the rest of the money in separate accounts. Separate accounts allow the policyholder to invest the cash in several combinations of stock and bond funds set to a comfortable yet measured risk-preference. As long as the investments within the policy outperform the internal policy costs, the policy holder can come out ahead and guarantee himself a decent retirement income through tax free withdrawals.

The recent turmoil in the stock market, however, has wreaked havoc on the cash values within the VULs. The skeptics are absolutely right when they say that a market downturn can make a poorly designed policy virtually worthless. And it might take years before the cash values yield net positive returns and thereby make the policy assumptions true once again.

The depressed markets do offer a unique opportunity for certain investors to look into the VUL as a retirement vehicle. Does this mean that everyone should just go buy a new policy and pitch their 401(k), IRAs and other qualified retirement accounts? The answer is a vehement NO. VUL should only be considered as an option for retirement only after maximizing available alternatives for retirement.

Before you make a decision to buy a VUL, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of owning a policy. Important advantages of a VUL are flexibility of premiums and death benefit, tax-free investment earnings and tax-free withdrawals through policy loans. Some important disadvantages are that they are costlier than other types of life insurance, may lose value in bear markets or with bad investment choices and can be complex to understand and thereby set wrong expectations.

Whether a VUL suits your retirement needs depends on your specific situation. It is vital to have a vigorous dialogue with your financial advisor to discuss the pros and cons of buying such a policy for the purpose of retirement planning. It is easy to get carried away by illustrations that show unrealistic linear returns over long periods of time. The stock market, as we all know, does not behave in a linear upward fashion. The last thing you want to do is throw good money in a bad strategy and expect a good outcome.
