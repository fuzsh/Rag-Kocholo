Atos Syntel Prayas Foundation

Founded in 2006, S’Prayas is Atos’ Corporate Social Responsibility vehicle. With the mission of “Enriching Young Minds”, S’Prayas has created new opportunities for many bright, underprivileged children in the communities we call home.

As a technology company, we believe in holistic enrichment and imparting knowledge through the power of computer learning. Over our 12+ year journey, we have set up computer labs at NGO centers across India, and our volunteers have worked tirelessly to help children in these communities develop life skills and become responsible and productive members of society.

S’Prayas leverages Atos’ most important resource — our people — and their collective knowledge to help these children enrich their lives. Our volunteers contribute their time, skills and experience to work with local outreach programs to drive social change.

Our commitment to innovation is reflected in the S’Prayas computer-based learning approach, which incorporates the latest educational thinking and digital tools to prepare disadvantaged youth to join tomorrow’s workforce.
