New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony would be open to waiving the no-trade clause in his contract if it meant playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers or Houston Rockets, according to a report from ESPN.

Per the report:

The arrival of All-Star guard Chris Paul to join MVP runner-up James Harden has catapulted the Rockets into contention for Anthony and established his interest in joining the Rockets, sources said.

Cleveland has remained a preferred destination for Anthony because of the presence of LeBron James.

While the Cavs remain highly interested in Anthony, their preference is to claim him off waivers following a contract buyout. But Knicks owner James Dolan does not appear interested in buying out Anthony's deal at this time.

Despite some speculation, the Cavs are unlikely to include power forward Kevin Love in a trade for Anthony. Instead, previous discussions about Anthony have centered around Cavs bench players and possibly draft-and-stash prospect Cedi Osman, sources told Amico Hoops.

Both the Cavs and Knicks are looking to fill the roles of top basketball executives. The Cavs parted ways with former general manager David Griffin nearly two weeks ago, and the Knicks did the same with former team president Phil Jackson last week.

Interestingly, Griffin reportedly is in line to interview for the Knicks vacancy.

Anthony averaged 22.4 points and 5.9 rebounds in 74 games last season.

Several opposing league executives told Amico Hoops they strongly believe Anthony will end up in Cleveland before the start of next season.
