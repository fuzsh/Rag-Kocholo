        "text": "Just shy of his 39th birthday Carmelo Anthony has announced that his basketball days are over. The decision comes as no surprise to anyone. The future Hall of Famer had been without a team after leaving the LA Lakers in 2021.\n\nIn 2019, Melo had a tough year; his career appeared to be in his final moments. However, he returned and signed with the Trail Blazers after a year of not playing for the Rockets. Carmelo had a role as a bench player and averaged 15.4 points per game.\n\nHe became a fan favorite with the Nuggets and Knicks for his prolific scoring. He was known for his ability to make difficult shots, making him one of the best in the league. He played for 14 seasons and has maintained an average of at least 20 points per game. He currently holds the ninth position on the NBA all-time scoring list.\n\nWhat records does Carmelo Anthony hold in the NBA and USA Basketball?\n\nAnthony has won three Gold medals for Team USA and was instrumental in leading Syracuse to the 2003 NCAA national championship during his college career. But, unfortunately, he never won an NBA title."
