        "text": "The 2022-23 NBA regular season officially came to a close on Sunday afternoon when all 30 teams played their final game.\n\nOn Tuesday, the play-in tournament will begin, and the NBA Playoffs will tip off on Saturday afternoon.\n\nTen-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony went the entire season without getting signed, and this is the first year he hadn't played in an NBA game since 2002 (when he was still in college).\n\nDid NBA Teams Make A Mistake?\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is currently 38 years old, so he is far removed from his prime.\n\nThat said, Anthony played in 69 regular season games for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2021-22 season and was a productive role player off the bench.\n\nHe averaged 13.3 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per contest while shooting 44.1% from the field and 37.5% from the three-point range.\n\nThere is no question that he still remains among one of the top 450 basketball players in the world.\n\nAccording to StatMuse, of the bench players that played 50+ games during the 2022-23 season, only six averaged 13.0 points per contest or more.\n\nAssuming Anthony played similarly to the way he did in 2022, that would have ranked him among the top bench scorers in the entire league.\n\nWhile there are rightfully questions about his defense (especially at his age), his scoring could have made up for the potential defensive liabilities.\n\nIn addition to his ability to still produce as a shooter, Anthony is one of the best players of all time and would have made many fanbases happy with his presence.\n\nOverall, the six-time All-NBA player could have helped out many different teams and should have been given a chance on a ten-day contract or non-guaranteed deal."
