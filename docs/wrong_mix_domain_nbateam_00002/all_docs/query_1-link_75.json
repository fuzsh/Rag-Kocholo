        "text": "The U.S. National Men's Basketball Team is likely to be at less than full strength for its international friendly against Australia ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Brian Windhorst, Star forward Kevin Durant missed practice Saturday due to a calf strain. Team USA head coach Steve Kerr downplayed the injury but also said it's unlikely the Phoenix Suns star and former Texas basketball star will suit up for the warmup game in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nDurant can surpass former U.S. teammate Carmelo Anthony to become the first four-time gold medalist with another gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He is the all-time leader in scoring with 435 points, 3-pointers (74) and free throws (69).\n\nHere's what you need to know about Durant and his availability for Monday's exhibition game vs. Australia.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Follow USA TODAY's complete coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nWill Kevin Durant play today vs. Australia?\n\nDurant sat out Saturday's practice for Team USA and is likely to miss today's international friendly game against Australia. The game will serve as a warmup. Durant missed Team USA's 86-72 victory over Canada at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nKerr, Durant's former coach from his days with the Warriors, has downplayed any concern about the injury and if Durant would have to be replaced on the roster. Durant suffered his calf injury two weeks ago.\n\n\"I know there's still a couple of weeks before we have to make a decision roster-wise,\" Kerr said to ESPN. \"So we're just taking it day by day.\"\n\nTeam USA has another warmup exhibition game against Serbia on Wednesday and two more against South Sudan (July 20) and Germany (July 22) in London before opening the Olympics against Serbia on July 28.\n\nWill Kevin Durant be replaced on the Team USA roster?\n\nTeam USA already had to replace one player on its roster last week when Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard could not compete due to a knee injury. NBA Champion and Boston Celtics guard Derrick White was called up to take his place. The contingency plan to swap out Leonard for White had been in place.\n\nAccording to the ESPN report, Kerr has downplayed whether there is a plan in place if Durant cannot play and the team needs an immediate replacement.\n\n\"It's not something we've even discussed at this point because we feel good that [Durant] is going to be OK,\" Kerr said.\n\nKevin Durant Olympic stats\n\nHere's a look at Durant's stats during the three Olympics he has played in:\n\n2012: 19.5 points per game, 5.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.6 blocks on 48.5% overall shooting and 52.3-point shooting in 26.1 minutes in eight games\n\n2016: 19.4 points per game, 5.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.5 blocks on 57.8% overall shooting and 58.1 3-point shooting in 28.8 minutes in eight games\n\n2020: 20.7 points per game, 5.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.2 blocks on 52.9% overall shooting and 37.5% 3-point shooting in 27.5 minutes in eight games\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.
