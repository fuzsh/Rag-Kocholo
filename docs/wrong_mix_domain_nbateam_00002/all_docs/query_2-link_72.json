        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks have an open roster spot, and a veteran like Carmelo Anthony is still available. Anthony spent last season with the Los Angeles Lakers and actually played quite well. He’s well beyond his years of stardom with the Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks, but Anthony can still offer plenty to the Mavericks.\n\nCarmelo Anthony Is a Fit for the Dallas Mavericks\n\nThe Player\n\nThe numbers were actually quite solid last season. Los Angeles struggled as a whole, but Anthony still managed to average about 13 points and four rebounds per game. Most notably, however, Anthony shot close to 38 percent from three.\n\nHe’s become a role player since departing the Knicks and spent time with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, and Portland Trail Blazers before landing with the Lakers. During that time, he’s never averaged more than 16 points per game. With that being said, he doesn’t have to do that as a role player off the bench.\n\nThe three-point shooting is the most enticing aspect of Anthony’s current game. In 2020/21, with the Trail Blazers, he shot 41 percent from three. The season prior to that, also with the Trail Blazers, Anthony shot 39 percent from three. He’s been rather consistent as one of the better long-range shooters in the league.\n\nIn addition, Anthony is a veteran. It goes without saying that the Mavericks are looking to win a championship, especially with a rare MVP-like superstar like Luka Doncic, and championship teams are often full of top veterans.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks Fit\n\nDoncic will lead the offense, that goes without saying. Then there are other weapons such as Spencer Dinwiddie and the newly-acquired Christian Wood, who is a rare offensive gem.\n\nThe perimeter defense will be carried by the likes of Dorian Finney-Smith and Reggie Bullock. Dallas also brought in JaVale McGee to anchor the defense and rebound.\n\nOutside of these players, the Mavericks’ scoring contributors include Tim Hardaway Jr. and Maxi Kleber. Hardaway Jr. is solid, although coming off an injury. He’ll be a weapon, but he can’t carry too much of a load. Kleber can shoot, but he can’t be expected to consistently score double-digits. Other players such as Josh Green and Jaden Hardy are unproven. There’s also Davis Bertans, but he didn’t prove to be a major contributor in the playoffs last season.\n\nThis is where Anthony fits in. He doesn’t need to start, nor does he have to average the 26 minutes per game he did last season. His defense isn’t great, but he can feature as a catch-and-shoot player, but also someone who knows how to create his own shot. Dallas can throw in Anthony in spurts, and the veteran will surely contribute on offense. Doncic is one of the best shot creators in the league and he’ll make sure to find Anthony.\n\nAnthony isn’t a “dream player” for the Mavericks in any way. With that being said, the team’s options are very limited. Anthony remains one of the better options left on the market, and a one-year deal may just be worth it for Dallas."
