        "text": "A report on ESPN came out Wednesday that the New York Knicks had approached the Cleveland Cavaliers concerning their interest in swapping Carmelo Anthony for Kevin Love, but they were told the Cavaliers were not remotely interested in the trade.\n\nIt was announced Thursday afternoon via the Vertical that per league sources the Knicks have also reached out to the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Clippers about a possible deal including Carmelo Anthony.\n\nKnicks president Phil Jackson is set on finding a deal that Anthony would agree to accept before the Feb. 23 NBA trade deadline.\n\nJackson is headstrong to rid the roster of Anthony and his contract, and start rebuilding around their young big Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are a team that may interest Anthony, per the Vertical.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Anthony said his recent meeting with Jackson and Knicks general manager Steve Mills lasted only five to seven minutes — with Jackson doing most of the talking.\n\nCarmelo Anthony has spoken about voiding his no-trade clause.\n\n“I mean, if they want to go in a different direction, that’s something that I have to consider. I would have to consider that.” Anthony stated. “Like I said, all the talk that’s going on right now, that’s out of my control. Nobody called me. Nobody got in contact with any of my representation or anything like that, so it’s something that I don’t worry about. I’m not thinking about that right now.”\n\n“You ask me a question if he thinks I’d want to play with him?’’ Anthony said following LeBron James’ insistence that the Cavs needed another playmaker. “Yes. I do think he’d want me to play with him. I don’t think he wouldn’t. But I don’t know if that comment was about me. I don’t think I’m the only playmaker in the NBA.’’\n\nWhen Anthony was asked by the New York Post if he would want to play in Cleveland, Melo said “I don’t think about it — not something I think about right now. As far as playing with him, I don’t think about that. I can’t think about that. You know I’m not thinking about that.”\n\nAs he shouldn’t be. Phil Jackson has now realized how foolish it was to extend Anthony long-term with a max contract. And he’s willing to do anything to relieve the Knicks of his services.\n\nAs soon as a report came out Wednesday that the Knicks had interest in dealing Anthony, Cavs fans lost their minds.\n\n“Hey, it’s the wing that we need! He can guard Golden State’s wings better than Kevin Love ever could! He’s LeBron’s buddy, it’s sure to happen!”\n\nThis is only some of the commentary social media had to offer concerning a Kevin Love/Carmleo Anthony swap.\n\nEarlier this week Hoop Magazine did an article ranking the defensive proficiency of every wing in the league.\n\nAnthony ranked 55th out of the 62 players listed.\n\nAnthony was never a plus defender, but at this point in his career, he’s slow, lazy, and a liability. He may fit the criteria of a wing that Cleveland needs, but not at the price or the cost of baggage added on.\n\nAdvanced Syngery numbers aren’t even needed to express this.\n\nLove, not known for his speed or ability to move quickly defensively, is leaps and bounds faster than Anthony on the defensive end.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Kevin Love is a plus defender.\n\nIt goes to show that Anthony has regressed physically with age. He plays most of his minutes at the power forward spot. He saves the last of his athleticism and effort for slashing at the basket, what he does best.\n\nThe Knicks have been faced with the issue of whether or not it’s the right time to give the keys of the franchise to Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nComing into the season we have seen flashes of what the young star can do. His long 7'3\" frame has especially made the Knicks one of the better teams at protecting the rim. Porzingis is currently averaging 18.8 points per game, 7.1 rebounds, 1.9 blocks, and is shooting 38.4 percent from three. He’s a special talent.\n\nThe issue has been, Anthony stands in the way.\n\nOn the year Anthony has played 92.5 percent of the minutes in the ten most used lineups for the Knicks. Porzingis has only played 83.3% of the time. Anthony is still the primary guy for the Knicks.\n\nAdding some perspective, for Cleveland, LeBron James is in 95.9 percent of the time, Kyrie Irving is in 91.6 percent of the time, and Kevin Love is in 85.9 percent of the time.\n\nIn one of the two lineups Anthony isn’t in, the 9th most used lineup, is actually the best lineup the Knicks employ, as shows the chart below.\n\nThe sample size is on the small side, but the Knicks running out 3 guards with Joakim Noah and Porzingis has an offensive rating of 133.1 and a defensive rating of 84.8, which would both lead the league in their respective categories.\n\nThis lineup isn’t optimal to start, but it’s interesting to see how the Knicks play when the employ a lineup coach Jeff Hornacek would be much in favor of.\n\nAt this point in their careers, Love and Anthony are practically producing the same offensive numbers\n\nAnthony obviously has the larger offensive role, and takes about three more shots a game. Love, compared to the prior two years where he he wasn’t near scoring 20 plus points per game, has stepped into a larger offensive role and embraced it. While playing less and shooting less than Melo does on a nightly basis.\n\nTheir on/off comparisons speak to the same accord.\n\nThe idea that Carmelo Anthony hurts the Knicks offensively when he’s on the floor is not true. His presence makes the Knicks a little bit better scoring-wise, especially from three-point range.\n\nHowever look at the change at the Knicks’ defensive rating when he’s off the floor. It drops more than 7 points, and 5 points for the team as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, having Kevin Love on the floor is both an offensive and defensive positive. When he’s on the court, Cleveland’s offensive rating rises by 2, and their defensive rating drops by 8.\n\nMeaning, Love’s defensive presence at power forward is more valuable than the flip side of Anthony’s defensive hindrance.\n\nThe defensive stopper that Cleveland is looking for is not Melo.\n\nCleveland has lost three straight, and they seem to have hit a pivotal moment. Without J.R. Smith, and a disappointing Kyle Korver, it seems the Cavaliers cannot hold teams down the stretch and just fade away, struggling against and losing to inferior teams.\n\nPerhaps LeBron is right. Maybe they do need another playmaking guard off the bench even more than a 3 and D wing, which is unlikely to be found before the deadline.\n\nKevin Love has been slumping from three-point range lately, but it seems the winter months do that to him consistently. History says he’ll bounce back soon.\n\nThe moral of this story? The Cavaliers need to look elsewhere to find help at the wing. Carmelo Anthony is a defensive black hole that cannot be fixed.\n\nPhil Jackson wanting to trade him elsewhere marks a new era of basketball in New York. This Knicks team is headed towards a future built around Porzingis. Sooner rather than later.\n\nEven if Jackson somehow manages to trade Anthony to the Clippers, the package back isn’t going to be all that much.\n\nMaybe Jamal Crawford, Austin Rivers (who the Knicks had tried to sign in last summer’s free agency), a bench piece, and a second rounder?\n\nEven so, Jackson would likely have to pull of a 3-team trade, to keep the Knicks and the Clipper’s roster somewhat intact.\n\nOr another deadline will pass by. Carmelo’s contract will increase to 26.2 million next year, and the Knicks again will be stuck with a player they aren’t building around.\n\nGood luck Phil. Let the Carmelo Anthony saga begin."
