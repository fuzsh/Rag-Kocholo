Averaging 15 points and six rebound per game with the Trailblazers this season.\n\nNow that the league is nearing its return, he wants to pick up where he left off and help the Blazers get back to the playoffs.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, it's my role is to continue to do what I've been doing something right and that that has been clear cut for me from day. Once you know why even got here that conversation and we all have stuck with that plan. As you can see it's worked\" Melo told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nWith injured Blazers on their way back to the court, it actually offers Melo a chance to go back to the so-called \"3\" or small forward spot.\n\n\"The good thing is I get to go back to my original position which is planned at the three where I'm actually very comfortable at that. I've been doing that my whole life just over the past you know couple years as well. I started moving transitioning towards playing the four. Teams are going small, so that was to my advantage as well but I think today in this game. There's no positions, no more today. So it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThere are of course, for as excited as Melo is to return to action, concerns as the coronavirus pandemic rages on in most of the country but especially in Florida where the NBA is launching its restart at Disney World in Florida.\n\n\"We can't control what happens, you know, we don't know what's gonna happen. We don't know. You don't know who's gonna get sick, who's not gonna get sick. We know that. But I think we're doing everything in our power to try to prevent that.\"\n\nThe NBA is set to restart its season on July 30 with 22 teams that will eventually settle into 16 playoff teams with the NBA Finals in October."
