        "text": "A proud 10-time All-Star, Anthony never came off the bench in his first 15 NBA seasons. He shot down even the suggestion of it at the end of 2017-18 when he was with Oklahoma City. “I’m not sacrificing no bench role,” he said as the Thunder’s season ended.\n\nThe next season in Houston, Anthony came off the bench eight times in 10 games before being taken out of the rotation. He started all 58 games he played after signing with the Trail Blazers last season, but at 36, faced the bench issue again this season. “I had to swallow that pill,” Anthony said.\n\nThe move has suited him. Anthony is averaging 13.6 ppg in 24.8 minutes and shooting 40% on 3-pointers, just a tick shy of his career high. Pro-rated to 36 minutes, Melo is basically Melo averaging 19.8 points on 16.8 shots.\n\nAnthony said his comfort level in Portland and rapport with teammates such as Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum eased the decision. “It was just coming to a mutual agreement about what the situation would be,” he said. “And … just going out there and wanting to play basketball. Wanting to be a part of what’s happening. To be a major part of our team’s success.”"
