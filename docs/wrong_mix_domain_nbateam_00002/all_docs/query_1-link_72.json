        "text": "It's not uncommon to spot NBA stars in town during the week of the Nike EYBL Peach Jam.\n\nFor Augusta University guard Tyree Myers, a call from Jaguars' men's basketball coach Dip Metress changed the landscape of his Monday afternoon. Former NBA star Carmelo Anthony was set to visit Christenberry Fieldhouse for a workout later that day, and Myers wasn't going to miss it.\n\nMore: Here's why this Augusta-area based team is primed for a repeat performance at the Peach Jam\n\n“Dip texted me that Carmelo was about to work out at our gym in a couple of hours and I told him I’m trying to go. He told me to come to the gym around 5 p.m.,\" Myers said. “I got a single workout in first and then eventually Melo, his son and a family member came. Melo was down at the other end for his workout and me and his son were down at the other end doing our workout. After we both finished, we finished together with condition and shooting, so that’s kind of how it went.”\n\nThe Denver Nuggets selected Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft out of Syracuse. He went on to earn 10 all-star selections over a 20-year NBA career, including a scoring title and three Olympic gold medals.\n\nMyers recently helped lead Augusta to the NCAA Division-II national championship game. The rising senior from Baltimore is the unspoken leader of the team and his ability as a scorer lends itself to Anthony's experience on the court.\n\nMore: Augusta University basketball punches ticket to National Championship game\n\nAs it turns out, Myers' relationship with Anthony goes back to before he stepped on the floor at Christenberry.\n\n“It was really cool. So you know I played with Team Melo my last year of AAU basketball down at Peach Jam. I’m familiar with the staff and everybody who works with him. It was really cool to work out with a hall-of-famer and just share the same gym as him.”\n\nMore: Here are the 20 players you need to keep an eye on at the Peach Jam\n\nAccording to Myers, Anthony looks like he can still compete in the NBA right now.\n\n“Yes, for sure,\" he said. \"Once a shooter, always a shooter. Once a bucket getter, always a bucket getter.”"
