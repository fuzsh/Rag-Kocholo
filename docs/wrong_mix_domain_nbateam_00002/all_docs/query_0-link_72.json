        "text": "Anthony still has two years and over $52 million remaining on his deal. He also has a no-trade clause, meaning he can turn down any potential trade, a hold-up if the Knicks were looking to move him.\n\nOn Wednesday, Anthony was asked about the idea of playing with LeBron James after James ranted about the need to improve the Cavs' roster, specifically with another playmaker.\n\n\"You ask me a question do I think he would want me to play with him?\" Anthony said. \"Yes. I do think he would want me to play with him. I don't think he wouldn't. But I don't know if that comment is about me. I don't think I'm the only playmaker in the NBA.\"\n\nAccording to ESPN, the Cavs are not interested in parting with Love due to the role he played in helping them win a championship last season. Love is having a strong 2016-17, averaging 20 points and 11 rebounds per game on 37% three-point shooting. Love is also five years younger than Anthony and on a contract through 2019-20.\n\nWith less than a month remaining until the NBA's trade deadline, it doesn't sound like this will be the last we hear of either of these teams."
