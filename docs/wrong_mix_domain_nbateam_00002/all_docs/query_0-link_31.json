        "text": "So would Carmelo Anthony have made any difference if he were decked in wine and gold this June and the Cavaliers had pulled the trigger on the Knicks All-Star before February’s trade deadline?\n\nDoes San Francisco need another bay?\n\nNo, NBA insiders believe Anthony would not have been an important addition against the sleek, fleet machine of the Warriors, who lead the NBA Finals 2-0 after two straight blowouts in which they’ve rung up 113 and 132 points.\n\nIf the Cavaliers are swept, figure Cleveland looks to do something major in the offseason — with LeBron James no doubt pulling the strings for his longtime buddy despite his increasing rep as a poor defender. In-season adds of Deron Williams and Kyle Korver have not been the answer against Golden State.\n\n“In regards to this series and matching up versus Golden State, I don’t see how Carmelo would have made an impact in this series,’’ said former Nets assistant general manager Bobby Marks, who is now The Vertical’s trade analyst. “The defensive side of the ball would have been a major issue since Cleveland would not be able to hide him. Plus who does he guard? Draymond [Green]. Carmelo at this stage is best in the halfcourt. Ty Lue has made it clear that this Cleveland team is best getting up and down the floor. Plus he would have trouble scoring with [Kevin] Durant or Green on him.”\n\nIndeed, one NBA assistant coach said Anthony is best at isolation and the Warriors’ defense is so ferocious, isolationists and players who don’t move the ball feed into Steve Kerr’s defensive game plan. Also, James is struggling enough with Durant. Imagine Anthony.\n\nPlus, if the Cavaliers had somehow made the Knicks deal, they would have had to depart with Kevin Love, who hasn’t been the problem. In Game 1, Love scored 15 points, along with 21 rebounds and three blocks. He followed that up with 27 points, seven rebounds and two steals on 12-of-23 shooting in Game 2. His minus-8 was second-best on the Cavaliers.\n\n“Anthony would be a great addition to any team. The question is who has to be traded to get him,” said Jeff Van Gundy, the ABC/ESPN analyst and former Knicks coach. “If it was Love, I don’t think that makes sense for Cleveland.”\n\nCavaliers GM David Griffin refused to even think of parting with the younger Love for Anthony in the winter, but Griffin might be gone soon because his contract is up and he’s reportedly getting interest from the Bucks. But another general manager would have a difficult time dealing for Anthony if Love is not part of the package. The over-the-cap Cavaliers don’t have even first-round picks to peddle and Anthony’s trade kicker balloons his pact to more than $33 million.\n\n“I don’t see any trade of Melo to the Cavs that makes them better and that the Knicks would agree to,’’ one NBA GM said.\n\nMaybe a four-team trade is the only thing that could get something to work financially.\n\n“I don’t see a deal possible between Cleveland and [New York],’’ said Marks, whose specialty was the salary cap when he worked with the Nets. “The problem with Cleveland is one, they don’t have a draft pick until 2021, and that pick is a keeper based on where this Cleveland team could be in four years.\n\n“Plus eventually they will need to get younger here. Also the contracts just don’t match up when you take Kevin Love out of the equation. Unless the Knicks want to take a combination of [Iman] Shumpert, [Channing] Frye, R.J. [Richard Jefferson], and that still does not work [financially]. Basically it depletes the Cavaliers’ depth and you’re stuck with minimums on the bench. I don’t think that makes you any better.”"
