I can’t guarantee a Championship. It’s very, very hard to win a Championship in this league.\n\n“But I think we could compete with anybody with Carmelo Anthony on our team.”\n\nWhether or not Carmelo would waive his no-trade clause for a team other than the Rockets or Cavs still remains to be seen.\n\nBut McCollum and Damian Lillard seemed confident in Portland’s chances of landing Carmelo while at Dame’s annual basketball camp in Beaverton yesterday."
