        "text": "Former New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony announced his retirement from professional on Monday, ending an NBA career that spanned 19 seasons.\n\nAnthony disclosed the news in a video posted to his social media channels, one featuring highlights from a lauded career that included professional stops in Denver, Oklahoma City, Houston, Portland, and Los Angeles in addition to seven seasons with the Knicks (2011-17). In that video, set to the soundtrack of \"All That I Got Is You\" by Ghostface Killah and Mary J. Blige, Anthony also passes on control of his legacy to his son Kiyan, who currently stars at Christ the King High School in Queens.\n\n\"I remember the days when I had nothing. Just a ball on the court and a dream of something more,\" Anthony says as highlights throughout his career are shown. \"Basketball was my outlet. My purpose was strong, my communities, the cities I represented with pride, and the fans that supported me along the way. I am forever grateful to those people and places because they made me, Carmelo Anthony.\"\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Anthony came to the Knicks through a trade in February 2011 after eight seasons with his original NBA employers, the Denver Nuggets. Denver welcomed him in as the third overall pick of the 2003 NBA Draft, going shortly after top pick and close friend LeBron James and before fellow stars-to-be Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.\n\nIt marked not only a return to New York City but a return to Empire State basketball after spending his high school days between Towson Catholic (MD) and Oak Hill Academy (VA): Anthony previously starred at Syracuse University for a season, helping the Orange take home the 2003 NCAA National Championship. Anthony was bestowed the tournament's Most Outstanding Player award for his efforts, which included a 33-point tally that set a record for most points by a freshman in a single game.\n\nAnthony's ride in New York was a roller coaster. Though the Knicks struggled to move forward on the NBA Playoff bracket (winning just one series in Anthony's seven seasons), he provided some exhilarating moments on the floor. In New York lore, Anthony is perhaps best known for his 2012-13 showcase, which saw him engage in a memorable battle for the scoring title with Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant. Anthony prevailed at 28.7 per game and earned All-NBA Second Team honors for his efforts. That season saw the Knicks win 54 games and earn their first postseason series victory in 13 years, as the second-seeded group bested Boston before falling to Indiana.\n\nIn the following season, Anthony posted perhaps one of the greatest individual performances in the history of the Knicks and New York professional sports as a whole by tallying 62 points and 13 rebounds while losing no turnovers in a January 2014 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. His historic points tally stands as a record for both the Knicks and hardwood affairs at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOther New York records in Anthony's grasp include the marks for most consecutive 20-point games (31 in 2012-13) and most points in a single quarter (25 in a January 2017 loss to Washington). He previously tied the all-time NBA mark in the latter category (sharing it with George Gervin) in 2008 with Denver.\n\nAnthony's dream to play in New York, however, took on nightmarish undertones, as he frequently clashed with management, including head coach Mike D'Antoni and later team president Phil Jackson. He'd be dealt to Oklahoma City in September 2017, tipping off a nomadic period where he continued to climb up the list of all-time NBA scoring leaders and provide glimpses of the old Anthony from time to time. In Portland, for example, Anthony became the first player aged 35 or older since Tim Duncan to win the Western Conference Player of the Week Award, earning that honor during the 2018-19 season. His final NBA days were spent alongside James with the Los Angeles Lakers, playing 69 games in 2021-22.\n\nThough Anthony's Knicks career ended dubiously, no New Yorker has worn his No. 7 since his departure. Anthony was forced to ditch the No. 15 he wore in Syracuse and Denver with the Knicks having long retired it for Earl Monroe. Some clamored for the Knicks to add the free agent Anthony to this year's roster but he did not take to an NBA floor during this season.\n\nAs it stands, Anthony departs the Association in ninth place on its all-time scoring list. Anthony also carries 10 All-Star appearances to his name and was also named the NBA's Social Justice Champion after the 2020-21 campaign. For his efforts, Anthony was included among the NBA's 75 Greatest Players released last season in recognition of the Association's 75th anniversary. Though a Larry O'Brien Trophy hoist eluded him, Anthony did earn three Olympic gold medals through his time in the American efforts in Beijing (2008), London (2012), and Rio de Janeiro (2016).\n\nGeoff Magliocchetti is on Twitter @GeoffJMags\n\nWant the latest in breaking news and insider information on the Knicks?
