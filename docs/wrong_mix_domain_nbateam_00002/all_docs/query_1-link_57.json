He played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and has been named an NBA All–Star ten times and an All–NBA Team member six times. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange, winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. During the NBA's 75th Anniversary, he was named one of the 75 Greatest Players in NBA History.\n\nAfter one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA Draft and was selected with the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their first Conference Finals appearance since 1985, but lost to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in six games. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks days before the NBA trade deadline. In 2013, he won his only scoring title. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks' single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden single-game scoring record. Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one season before a short stint with the Houston Rockets. He spent two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers prior to joining the Los Angeles Lakers, the team whom he would play his final season with.\n\nAnthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was the US Olympic team's all-time leader in points, rebounds, and games played.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nAnthony was born in the Red Hook projects in Brooklyn, New York City.[1] His father, after whom he is named, died of cancer when Anthony was two years old.[2] When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he honed not only his athletic skills, but his survival skills. Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, \"from drugs, to killings, to anything you can name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on. Those are the things that teach you toughness and keep you mentally focused on your goals.\" Sports would serve as an important diversion from the violence and drug dealing that were pervasive in the housing projects a few blocks from the homes of Anthony and his friends.[3]\n\nHigh school career[]\n\nAnthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school.[4] During the summer of 2000, when he grew five inches, he made a name for himself in the area, being named The Baltimore Sun's metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year.[5] Anthony transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia for his senior campaign. While at Oak Hill Academy, Anthony was named to the McDonald's All-American Team and won the Sprite Slam Jam dunk contest prior to the McDonald's All-American Game. He was also named a USA Today First-Team All-American and a Parade First-Team All-American.[6]\n\nCollege career[]\n\nAnthony played one season (2002–2003) at Syracuse University. He averaged 22.1 points (16th in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]|NCAA]], 4th in the Big East), and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, 3rd in the Big East, 1st among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made, and free throws made and attempted.[7] Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman.[8]\n\nIn the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's NCAA Most Outstanding Player Award.[9] Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as \"[...] by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn't even close. Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That's the bottom line.\"[10]\n\nAnthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA Draft.[11][12] Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30-5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year.[13]\n\nNBA career[]\n\nDenver Nuggets (2003–2011)[]\n\nRookie season (2003–2004)[]\n\nAnthony's NBA career began on June 26, 2003, when he was chosen in the first round (3rd overall) of the 2003 NBA Draft draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was selected behind LeBron James (1st overall, Cleveland Cavaliers) and Darko Miličić (2nd overall, Detroit Pistons).[14] He made his NBA regular season debut on October 29, 2003, in an 80-72 home win against the San Antonio Spurs.[15] Anthony finished the night with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists. In just his sixth career NBA game (November 7 versus the Los Angeles Clippers), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; Kobe Bryant was the youngest).[16] It was the fewest amount of games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA-NBA merger. On February 9, 2004, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86-83 win.[17] (See 2003–04 NBA season).\n\nOn February 13, 2004, Anthony participated in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge at All–Star Weekend. In 30 minutes of playing time, Anthony scored 17 points, grabbed 3 rebounds, and dished out 5 assists in a losing effort (142-118).[18] On March 30 of that year, he scored 41 points against the Seattle SuperSonics to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise mark for most points in a game by a rookie.[19] He also became the second–youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the Western Conference in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season.[6] The others to do so were David Robinson, Tim Duncan, and fellow rookie LeBron James.[13] Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice (March 10, 2004 – March 14, 2004 and April 6, 2004 – April 10, 2004) and was a unanimous NBA All–Rookie First Team selection. Anthony averaged 21.0 ppg during the season, which was more than any other rookie. That mark also placed him 12th overall in the entire league. Anthony was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, finishing as the runner–up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James.\n\nAnthony was a major part in the turn around of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17–65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They finished the 2003–04 campaign with a 43–39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the postseason. Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989-90 season.[6] The Nuggets faced the top–seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round. In Anthony's first career playoff game, he had 19 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists, in a 106–92 loss at Minnesota.[20] The Timberwolves eliminated the Nuggets in five games.[21]\n\nSophomore season (2004–2005)[]\n\nIn Anthony's second season, he started in 75 of the 82 games for the Denver Nuggets. He averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA. Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes. On December 4, 2004, versus the Miami Heat, Anthony became the third–youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points.[22] Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau. Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the 2005 All–Star Game), Anthony scored a game–high 31 points to go along with 5 boards, 2 assists, and 2 steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game.[23]\n\nWith Anthony's help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49–33. The Nuggets finished seventh place in the Western Conference (one spot higher than they finished the previous season). Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the first round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93–87.[24] However, the Spurs won the next four games, eliminating the Nuggets from the playoffs.[25]\n\nJunior season (2005–2006)[]\n\nAnthony played and started in 80 games during the season. He averaged 26.5 ppg (8th, NBA), 2.7 apg, 4.9 rpg, and 1.1 spg. His eighth place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the 1990-91 season, when Nuggets guard Michael Adams finished the season sixth in NBA scoring.\n\nOn November 23, 2005, with the Nuggets facing the two–time defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 17, 2006, versus the Memphis Grizzlies, he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark.[26] Also, in doing so, he became the second youngest player to accomplish that feat (behind James). As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11–5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March. He also took home Player of the Week honors for March 13, 2006 – March 19, 2006.[27]\n\nDuring the season, Anthony made five game–winning shots in the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006;[28] at home versus Phoenix on January 10;[29] at Minnesota on February 24;[30] at Indiana on March 15;[31] at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6.[32] All five of those game–winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three–point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force overtime vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6.[33] He made shots in the final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006,[34] and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would never lose.[35]\n\nAnthony was named to the All–NBA Third Team for the season, alongside Phoenix's Shawn Marion, Houston's Yao Ming, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Washington's Gilbert Arenas.\n\nThe Nuggets finished the season in third place, winning the Northwest Division for the first time in Anthony's career. Denver faced the sixth–seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. The Clippers held home court advantage in the series, due to ending the regular season with a better record (Denver finished 44-38; Los Angeles finished 47–35). The Clippers won the first two games of the series on their home floor.[36] The Nuggets split their games at home in Denver (winning game three; losing game four).[37] Denver then lost game five at Los Angeles, which eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs.[38]\n\nSenior season (2006–2007)[]\n\nIn the eighth game of the season (a 117–109 home win against the Toronto Raptors), Anthony tied the franchise record of six-straight 30-point games recorded by Alex English (1982–83 season).[39] Coincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English is now an Assistant Coach with the Toronto Raptors. Anthony fell short of establishing a new record in his ninth game (a 113–109 home victory over the Chicago Bulls on November 21, as he finished with 29 points.[40] After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six–straight 30–point games, failing to break it the second time around, as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6).[41]\n\nOn December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks-Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden.[42] Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York's Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern.[43] Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson in a bid to form a deadly combination with Anthony. The duo didn't get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15–game suspension.[44] Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points.\n\nOn February 2, Anthony and fellow teammate J.R. Smith were involved in a minor car accident.[45] Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first ever NBA triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[46] When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was left off of the roster.[47] However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard).[48] Anthony scored 20 points with 9 rebounds in his All-Star debut. Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All–Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001.\n\nAnthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–November 26; November 27–December 3; and February 5–February 11), and received Player of the Month honors for April, after leading the Nuggets to a 10–1 record for the month and into sixth place in the final regular season standings of the Western Conference. Anthony finished the season as the league's second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 ppg, while adding 6.0 rpg, 3.8 apg, and 1.2 spg. He was named to All–NBA Third Team for the second straight year, along with Miami's Dwyane Wade, Detroit's Chauncy Billups, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Orlando's Dwight Howard. For the second time in three years, Anthony and the sixth–seeded Nuggets faced the third–seeded San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs. In a virtual repeat of the 2005 first round playoff matchup between the two teams, Denver won the first game in San Antonio, 95–89, only to lose the next four games. The Nuggets were eliminated in the first round for the fourth straight year. In the playoff series against the Spurs, Anthony averaged a team–high 26.8 ppg to go along with 8.6 rpg, 1.2 apg, and 1.0 spg.\n\nMade All-Star Game Starter (2007–2008)[]\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game; his first as a starter.[49] He finished as the leading vote–getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players.[49] On February 8, Anthony scored a career–high 49 points in a 111-100 home win over the Washington Wizards.[50] He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19–of–25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second–highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20–of–26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000).[50][51]\n\nOn March 27, in a 118-105 Nuggets home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point.[52] He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA's fourth–leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career–highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career–high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second–best mark of his career.\n\nThe Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third–best all–time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season.[53] It was the first time since the 1987–88 season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.[53] Denver ended up as the 8th seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an 8th seed in NBA history.[53] It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top–seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57-25 overall record) in the first round of the playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16–team playoff format in 1983–84.[53] The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50–win team was swept in a best–of–seven playoff series in the first round.[54][55] For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 ppg, 9.5 rpg (playoff career–high), 2.0 apg and 0.5 spg.\n\nCareer go high (2008–2009)[]\n\nOn December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter.[56] Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, 3 assists, and 4 steals.\n\nOn January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time is estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow.[57]\n\nLast Full Season in the Denver (2009–2010)[]\n\nIn the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively.[58] Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets' history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74).[59] It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0.[59] In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points,[60] a game after his 41–point explosion against the Blazers, becoming the first Nugget to have scored back-to-back 40-point games since Michael Adams did it in 1991.[61] It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985.[61] In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA Player of the Week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start.[62][63]\n\nIn the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game.[64] He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight set by English.[65] The following game, Anthony scored a career–high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively.[66] Two days later, Anthony scored 19 points in the first quarter—tying a season-high he made in the fourth quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers—in a home loss to the Timberwolves.[67] On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards.[68] This was Anthony's third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team–high 27 points and 10 rebounds, in a losing effort as the team bowed to the Eastern Conference team.[69]\n\nIn the team's first game after the All–Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple–double of 43 points, 13 rebounds, and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, 6 rebounds, and 7 assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers' win streak.[70][71] On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors.[72] The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the first-round.[73] In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career high 42 points.[74][75] This also matched a franchise–playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English. However, the Nuggets lost the series to the Utah Jazz 4–2, with Anthony averaging a playoff career–high 30.7 points per game, along with 8.5 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 2.0 steals.\n\nBegan with speculation (2010–2011)[]\n\nThe 2010–11 season began with speculation, as several sources reported that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension the Nuggets had offered him. Sources also reported that Anthony's preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets, and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested.[76]Template:Unreliable source? Anthony's trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets' roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns.[77] He also hit game–winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010.[78]\n\nNew York Knicks (2011–2017)[]\n\nAim for the top (2011)[]\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with Point Guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi–player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.[79][80] Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. Anthony's first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony's acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference, and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar'e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In Game 2 of the playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career–high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and 6 assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks ended up losing to the Boston Celtics in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[81]\n\nCareer go high again (2011–2012)[]\n\nThe 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony's first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team's starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity.[82] However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense.[83] Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense. On Easter Day, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three–pointers in a victory over the Chicago Bulls.[84] Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D'Antoni.[85]\n\nThe Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the Miami Heat. During the series the Knicks were hampered by injuries as they were a season before. In the series, Tyson Chandler was diagnosed with the flu for game one, Iman Shumpert tore his ACL, Baron Davis tore his patella tendon, and All–Star Amar'e Stoudemire suffered a laceration on his hand after punching a fire extinguisher out of anger after a loss. In addition, Jeremy Lin had torn his left meniscus before the playoffs started. Despite the injuries, Anthony was able to lead the Knicks to their first playoff win since 2001. In the game, Anthony scored 41 points. The Knicks were easily eliminated by the eventual champion in 5 games, 4–1. Anthony was voted to the All–NBA Third Team.\n\nMade Best Team Record (2012–2013)[]\n\nOn December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012. For the said period, Anthony led the Knicks to a 3–1 mark, averaging a league–best 29.5 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks. Anthony scored over 30 points in two contests. In New York's 106-99 home victory over the Phoenix Suns on Dec. 2, Anthony scored a game-high 34 points, and added six rebounds, two assists, two blocks, and a steal.[86] On January 7, 2013, Anthony received his second Player of the Week citation for games played from December 31, 2012 to January 6, 2013. During that time, he led the team to a 2–1 record, tallying a league-best 36.0 ppg. The week was highlighted by a pair of 40–point games, first in a loss to Portland (45 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists) on January 1, and then in a victory over Orlando (40 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists) on January 5.[87] On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7.[88] On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks' team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games).[89] Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96–86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[90]\n\nOn March 29, 2013, Anthony recorded 32 points and 11 rebounds in a 111–102 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. His teammate J.R. Smith scored 37 points in the game.[91] On March 31, 2013, Anthony scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics as he recorded a double–double in consecutive games. With the victory, the Knicks won the season series against the Celtics (3-1) for the first time since the 2003–04 season.[92] On April 2, 2013, Anthony tied his career–high by scoring 50 points in a 102–90 win over the defending champion Miami Heat and became the first player in NBA history to record 50+ points with no baskets in the paint.[93] He followed the next night with 40 points in a 95–82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks,[94] and then 41 points against the Milwaukee Bucks two days later, becoming the first Knicks player since Bernard King to score 40+ points in three consecutive games.[95] He also became only the third NBA player to score at least 40 points on at least 60% FG shooting in 3 consecutive games, joining King and Michael Jordan.[96] On April 7, 2013, Anthony scored 36 points and 12 rebounds, 9 offensive, as the Knicks tallied their 12th straight win in a 125–120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was the team's 50th win of the season, and it marked the first time they posted that many wins in 13 years. By scoring 36 points to Kevin Durant's 27 points, he overtook the latter in the scoring race, upping his season average to 28.44 to Durant's 28.35 ppg.[97]\n\nOn April 8, 2013, Anthony and Minnesota's Nikola Peković were named Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for the period April 1–7, 2013. Anthony led the Knicks to a 4–0 record as part of their 12-game winning streak, during which he averaged 41.8 ppg.[98] On April 9, 2013, Anthony kept up his torrid pace as he once again scored 36 points on 13–21 FG shooting (3-4 from 3-point distance) as he became the first Knick since King to post five consecutive games of at least 35 points in a 120–99 victory over the Washington Wizards. It was also the team's 51st win, and 13th straight win, and they clinched their first Atlantic Division title since the 1993–1994 season.[99] No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in 5 straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–2007 season.[100] In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001.[101]\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Knicks' 13–game winning streak ended with a loss to the Chicago Bulls, 118–111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points on top of a season–high 19 rebounds, and he set a franchise record with six straight games with at least 35 points.[102] The following day, the Knicks bounced back with an easy 101–91 victory over the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers. Anthony again led the way with another double–double game of 31 points and 14 rebounds in just under 30 minutes as he sat out the entire fourth quarter for the second time in 3 games. On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his 2nd straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to April 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3–1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 ppg and a seventh-best 11.5 rpg.[103] He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 ppg after second place scorer and three–time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 ppg.[104] At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April, with Stephen Curry earning the Western Conference award. Anthony broke LeBron James' stranglehold on the monthly award, after James had received such honors five times that season.[105]\n\nIn the 2013 NBA Playoffs, Anthony scored 21 points to go with 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in the Knicks' series–clinching 88–80 Game 6 victory against the Boston Celtics in their first round playoff series. It was the Knicks' first playoff series win since 2000 (during the time of Patrick Ewing and Latrell Sprewell).[106] Anthony averaged a team–high 29.2 ppg in the series. This was the second highest playoff series average of a Knick player against the Celtics, behind Ewing's 31.6 during their 1989–1990 first–round series.[107][108] In the next round, the Knicks were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. On May 23, 2013, Anthony was named to the All–NBA Second Team, alongside Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, San Antonio's Tony Parker, the LA Clippers' Blake Griffin and Memphis' Marc Gasol. It was the second time in Anthony's career that he made the Second Team.[109]\n\nArrival of Phil Jackson and Derek Fisher (2013–2014)[]\n\nEarly in the 2013–14 season, the Knicks suffered a nine–game losing streak as the team opened with a 3–13 record. Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances averaging 26.3 ppg (421 points), 9.9 rpg (159 rebounds), and 1.1 steals (18 steals), nine double–doubles including 4 straight: against Indiana (30 points & 18 rebounds), Washington (23 & 12), Portland (34 & 15), and LA Clippers (27 & 10).[110]\n\nHowever, with the advent of the year 2014, the Knicks have gone 4–1 including big wins against last year's finalists Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs.[111] In the victory against the Heat, Anthony and James ended up in a virtual deadlock as the former registered 29 points (12–24 FG), 8 rebounds, 5 assists, and 2 steals as against the latter's 32 points (12–17 FG), 5 rebounds, 6 assists, 1 steal, and 1 block.\n\nOn January 13, 2014, Anthony was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played January 6–12, 2014 where he led the Knicks to a 3–0 record. He beat out Brooklyn's Joe Johnson and Detroit's Josh Smith for the honor.[112] On January 24, he established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single–game scoring with a 62–point, 13–rebound, 0 turnover effort against the Charlotte Bobcats.[113]\n\nOn January 30, 2014, in a 117–86 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony became the 50th NBA player to score 19,000 career points.[114] In doing so at the age of 29 years and 246 days old, Anthony became the 5th-youngest NBA player to achieve the feat, only beaten by LeBron James (27 years and 111 days), Kobe Bryant (28 and 223), Michael Jordan (29 and 62), and Wilt Chamberlain (29 and 75).[115]\n\nOn February 5, 2014, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the month of January alongside Kevin Durant who won Western Conference Player of the Month. Anthony led the Eastern Conference in scoring with a 28.7 ppg average, ninth in rebounding with 9.0 rpg average and third in minutes played with a 37.7 mpg average while leading the Knicks to a 10–6 record highlighted by his 62–point game effort against Charlotte.[116]\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Anthony played in his 7th All–Star Game as a starter for the East All–Stars. He scored 30 points and set an NBA All–Star game record of eight made three–pointers, breaking the old mark of six jointly shared by Mark Price and LeBron James.[117]\n\nOn March 10, 2014, Anthony won his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week citation for games played March 3–9, 2014. During the week, Anthony led the Knicks to a 3–1 record with averages of 29.0 ppg (third–best in the Eastern Conference), 5.3 rpg, 4.8 apg, and 2.75 spg (5th–best) while playing a conference 4th–best 38.7 mpg.[118]\n\nFor the 2013–14 season, Anthony averaged 27.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in a league–leading 38.7 minutes per game and would miss the NBA playoffs for the first time in his career.\n\nOn June 23, 2014, Anthony informed the Knicks that he will opt out of his contact and became a free agent.[119] On July 13, 2014, Anthony re–signed with the Knicks[120] to a reported five–year deal.[121]\n\nBig Three Break-up (2014–2015)[]\n\nIn just the team's third game in the season, Anthony became the 40th member of the exclusive 20,000 points club when he hit a three–pointer early in the first quarter of their 96–93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. He eventually finished with 28 points, hiking his total to 20,025 career points.[122] In the process, he became the 10th active player to achieve the milestone[123] and the sixth youngest in NBA history to reach the milestone.[124]\n\nOn January 22, 2015, Anthony was named as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh consecutive start and eight overall alongside LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Kyle Lowry, and John Wall.[125] After competing in the All–Star Game and scoring 10 points, Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the season on February 18 after undergoing left knee surgery.[126]\n\nArrival of Jeff Hornacek (2015–2016)[]\n\nOn January 21, 2016, Anthony was voted as starter for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.[127] On April 12, 2016, Anthony sat out on the season finale against the Pacers.\n\nBig Three Restored (2016–2017)[]\n\nOn July 28, 2016, Amar'e came back, the third period of Big Three started.\n\nOn December 9, 2016, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth (5th) active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark joining Dirk Nowitzki, James, Paul Pierce, and Vince Carter in the prestigious club. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone.[128] On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 compared to Baylor's 23,149.[129] On December 30, 2016, Anthony scored 26 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in a 92–104 loss upping his total to 23,192 points moving past Adrian Dantley into 27th place in the NBA career scoring list. After their game against the Houston Rockets on December 31, 2016 where he scored a measly 7 points after sitting down the second half of the game due to a sore left knee, he now has a total of 23,199 points.[130]\n\nIn a January 11, 2017 game against the Philadelphia 76ers which the team lost 98–97 on a buzzer–beater, Anthony scored 28 points to move past Robert Parish into 26th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.[131] On January 19, 2017, Anthony scored a Knicks-record 25 points in the second quarter breaking the old record of 24 points shared by Hall of Famer Willis Reed and Allan Houston. Reed scored his 24 points also in the second quarter while Houston's 24 points came in the fourth quarter.[132]\n\nOn January 21, 2017, Anthony was voted as starter for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. On January 29, 2017, Anthony scored a season–high 45 points, his first 40–point game for the season, in a quadruple–overtime game which the Atlanta Hawks won, 142–139. He added 6 points, 4 assists, and a block in one of his better all–around games this season which all went to naught as they lost another close game. He scored the game–tying baskets in the regulation and first OT period before he fouled out with 12.9 seconds left in the second OT.[133]\n\nIn their February 12, 2017 game against the San Antonio Spurs where the team eked out a 94–90 victory that salvaged the finale of their five–game homestand, Anthony scored a game–high 25 points to move past Charles Barkley into 25th position in the NBA career scoring list. He also has the fifth–most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce, and Carter, who is No. 24 in the scoring list.[134] It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[135] On February 15, 2017, he was announced to be the replacement for Kevin Love on the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, thus gaining his tenth All–Star appearance.[136]\n\nAnthony played 19 minutes, scored 10 points on 4–8 FG shooting including 2–6 on 3–PT and grabbed 3 rebounds in the All–Star Game.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (2017–2018)[]\n\nOn September 25, 2017, Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, and a 2018 second–round pick.\n\nOn November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the rankings, Anthony passed Allen Iverson on the NBA all–time scoring list and moved to the 24th spot. He finished the game with 28 points. On November 26, 2017, Anthony passed Ray Allen on the NBA all–time scoring list and moved to 23rd place. On December 11, 2017, Anthony passed Vince Carter for 22nd on the NBA all–time scoring list.\n\nOn January 4, 2018, in Oklahoma City's game against the Los Angeles Clippers as part of their LA back–to–back (on January 3 they beat the LA Lakers 133–96), Anthony scored 22 points, moving past Patrick Ewing into 21st place on the NBA all–time scoring list. On January 27, 2018, Anthony became the 21st NBA player to score 25,000 career points. In addition, he has 1,693 playoff points.\n\nOn March 6, 2018, in Oklahoma City's game against the Houston Rockets, Anthony scored 23 points to move past NBA legend Jerry West into the Top 20 in the NBA career scoring list as he now has a total of 25,210 as compared to West's 25,192 total points.\n\nOn March 19, 2018, in a 132–125 victory over the Toronto Raptors, Anthony scored 15 points to up his career total to 25,289, thereby moving past Reggie Miller into 19th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.\n\nOn July 25, 2018, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks in a three–team trade in which they acquired Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and Timothé Luwawu–Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers. The trade was widely seen as a cost–cutting move, as it saved the Thunder tens of millions of dollars in luxury tax payments. On July 30, Anthony accepted a contract buyout from the Hawks, and was subsequently placed on waivers.\n\nHouston Rockets (2018–2019)[]\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Anthony signed a one–year, $2.4 million veteran's minimum contract with the Houston Rockets coached by his former Knicks coach, Mike D'Antoni. On November 15, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that the team was \"parting ways\" with Anthony, but had not released him. He played ten games for Houston, starting twice, but he was held out of the last three for what the club called an unspecified \"illness.\" During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark. Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games. Morey said that Anthony \"accepted every role\" asked by D'Antoni, but that the \"fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.\" D'Antoni stated that he \"didn't ever want to disrespect [Anthony] and his career. He's going in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the Rockets traded Anthony, the draft rights to Jon Diebler, and undisclosed cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tadija Dragićević. This trade allowed the Rockets to alleviate luxury–tax penalties up to $2.6 million. On February 1, he was waived by the Bulls.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2019–2021)[]\n\nOn November 19, 2019, Anthony was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers to a one–year, non–guaranteed deal. With his last NBA game having been on November 8, 2018, Anthony made his debut as a Blazer in a 115–104 road loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on November 19; he started and had 10 points to go along with 4 rebounds and 1 block in 24 minutes of play. On November 25, Anthony scored a season–high 25 points along with 8 rebounds in a 117–94 road victory over the Chicago Bulls. In the same game, Anthony moved past Alex English into 18th spot on the NBA's all–time scoring list. A couple of days later Anthony was named Western Conference Player of the Week when he led the Trail Blazers to a 3–0 record with averages of 22.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game. On December 6, Anthony's contract became fully guaranteed. On January 1, 2020, Anthony bested his season–high by scoring 26 points in a 117–93 loss to the New York Knicks. On January 7, Anthony recorded a new season–high 28 points and seven rebounds, and hit the game–winning shot in a 101–99 win over the defending champion Toronto Raptors. On January 15, Anthony recorded his third double–double of the season with 18 points and a season–high 12 rebounds in Portland's 117–107 victory over the Rockets. On January 17, Anthony scored 22 points in a 120–112 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, while becoming the 18th player in NBA history to reach the 26,000 points mark. Anthony scored six points in the Trail Blazers' 125–112 win against the Rockets on January 29, and passed Kevin Garnett for 17th place in the NBA's all–time scoring list with a total of 26,073 points. On February 23, Anthony scored a season-high 32 points in a 107–104 victory against the Detroit Pistons. This was the first time that Anthony scored over 30 points since February 25, 2017, when he was playing for the New York Knicks.\n\nOn August 1, 2020, in the team's 1st game in the NBA restart against the Memphis Grizzlies, the team they were chasing for the eighth and final playoff spot, Anthony scored 21 points, his 768th career 20–point game leaving him 3 shy of tying Wilt Chamberlain for No. 8 all–time. Anthony ultimately tied Chamberlain for No. 8 all–time with 771 career 20–point games when he scored 21, 20, and 26 points against the Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, and Dallas Mavericks in their 5th, 6th, and 7th games in the NBA restart.\n\nIn the team's sixth game in the NBA restart against the Philadelphia 76ers on August 10, 2020, Anthony scored 20 points with 7 rebounds, 2 steals and a block as he passed Boston Celtics legends John Havlicek for 16th place and ultimately Paul Pierce for 15th in the NBA career scoring ladder with a then–total of 26,411 points. On August 13, 2020, just before the team's last game in the NBA restart against the Brooklyn Nets, Anthony was named the recipient of the 2019–20 Maurice Lucas Award, an award created in 2010–11 to \"honor the Trail Blazers player who best represents the indomitable spirit of Maurice Lucas through his contributions on the court and in the community, as well as in support of his teammates and the organization.\" Past winners included former Blazer LaMarcus Aldridge (2010–11 and 2014–15), Damian Lillard (2012–13), and Jusuf Nurkić (2018–19).\n\nIn Game 5 of the first round playoff series between the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers, Anthony and LeBron James became the third pair of opposing players over the age of 35 to score at least 25 points in a playoff game joining Elgin Baylor and Richie Guerin in 1970 and Jamal Crawford and Joe Johnson in 2017. Anthony finished the first round playoff series with averages of 15.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.4 blocks in five games.\n\n2020–21 season[]\n\nIn November 2020, Anthony re-signed with the Trail Blazers on a one-year contract. On January 1, 2021, in the first game of Portland's back–to–back game with the Golden State Warriors, Anthony scored a then season–high 18 points to move past Tim Duncan into 14th place on the NBA career scoring list. On February 2, Anthony scored 21 points in a game against the Washington Wizards and moved past Dominique Wilkins into 13th place on the NBA all–time scoring list. On February 9, Anthony scored 23 points against the Orlando Magic and moved past Oscar Robertson into 12th place on the NBA all–time career scoring list. On February 11, Anthony scored a then season-high 24 points in the 118–114 win against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 1, Anthony scored a season–high 29 points in a win against the Charlotte Hornets. On March 13, Anthony scored 26 points to move past Hakeem Olajuwon into 11th place on the NBA career scoring list in a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On March 19, Anthony scored 18 points off the bench in a victory over Dallas Mavericks and became 11th NBA player to score over 27,000 points. On May 3, Anthony scored 14 points in the 123–114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks, and moved past Elvin Hayes into the 10th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list. After the 2020–21 season, Anthony received the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion Award.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2021–2022)[]\n\nOn August 6, 2021, Anthony signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. On October 19, Anthony made his Lakers debut, putting up nine points, four rebounds, and two assists in a 121–114 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On October 24, Anthony put up 28 points in a 121–118 win over the Memphis Grizzlies and moved past Moses Malone into the 9th place on the NBA all–time career scoring list. On January 28, 2022, Anthony scored 19 points in a 117–114 loss to the Charlotte Hornets to became the 9th player in NBA history to reach 28,000 points. In a disappointing season due to injuries and inconsistencies, the Lakers have finished with a disappointing 33–49 record (11th) and missed the playoffs, and Anthony averaged 13.3 points per game with 37.5 percent three–point shooting in 69 appearances.\n\nOn May 22, 2023, Anthony announced his retirement from the NBA. On the same day of his retirement announcement, the team that drafted him, the Denver Nuggets, advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history after sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers, the same team Anthony fell short to in 2009 in the lone Conference finals appearance of his career.\n\nNational team career[]\n\nAnthony was one of 12 players named to the USA Basketball Men's Junior National Team in the summer of 2002. He was a member of the bronze medal–winning Team USA at the 2002 fourth Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament held in La Asunción, Margarita, Venezuela. He started all five contests and averaged a team–best 15.6 points per game despite playing an average of just 22.2 minutes an outing. His 6.2–rebound mark ranked second on the club behind Chris Bosh. He also averaged 1.8 assists, 1.2 steals, and 0.2 blocks per game. Anthony had 15 points and nine rebounds in a first round win against the Dominican Republic. He had 21 points and seven boards in 21 minutes versus Mexico, another Team USA triumph. He keyed a 75–73 victory against Argentina with a team–leading 23 points. In a two–point semifinal loss to host Venezuela, Anthony contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds. Team USA earned the bronze by beating Argentina, 71–65. Oregon mentor Ernie Kent coached the squad. Anthony had previous USA Basketball experience as a participant in the 2001 Youth Development Festival.\n\nAfter his rookie season, Anthony, along with fellow 2003 draftees LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, were chosen as members of the 2004 USA Olympic basketball team alongside veterans Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, and Tim Duncan that won the bronze medal. He averaged 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in seven of the team's eight games.\n\nIn 2006, Anthony was named co-captain (along with James and Wade) of Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal. On August 23, 2006, Anthony set the U.S. scoring record in a game with 35 points against Italy in the said FIBA tournament. The record was previously held by Kenny Anderson with 34 points in 1990. Anthony was named to the FIBA World Championship All–Tournament Team, posting averages of 19.9 points (led team), 3.7 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game. On January 16, 2006, Anthony was chosen as the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year after his performance at the FIBA World Championship.\n\nAnthony was also a member of Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. The team went undefeated, going 10–0. Anthony ended up as the team's leading scorer and tournament's second–leading scorer with a 21.2–point average (191 points in nine games), which was behind Leandro Barbosa of Brazil. Anthony also added 5.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 0.7 steals, and 0.3 blocks per game. He equaled the previous record of 28 points set by Allen Iverson in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title–clinching win against Argentina.\n\nAnthony was also named to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, again alongside James and Wade, with Kobe Bryant and Jason Kidd among others. The team won its games by an average winning margin of 32.2 points, eliminating Australia in the quarterfinals by 31 and beating Argentina by 20 points. Anthony scored 21 points against Argentina, making 3–of–14 field goals and 13–of–13 in free throws, setting USA Olympic game records for made free throws and free throw percentage. In the gold medal game, the United States defeated 2006 World Champion Spain, with Anthony scoring 13 points. Anthony posted averages of 11.5 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 1.0 steals per game in eight contests.\n\nAnthony, along with LeBron James, also participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London. It was his third straight Olympiad (2004, 2008, 2012), as he joined James and David Robinson (1988, 1992, 1996) as the only American basketball players to play in three Olympiads. Anthony played in all eight games, serving as Team USA's sixth man. He posted averages of 16.3 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 0.5 steals per game, built around 50% shooting from three–point range (23–46), 53% field–goal shooting (46–86), and 79% free throws (15–19). In a 156–73 victory over Nigeria, Anthony connected on 10–12 three–point attempts, both US Olympic records for made and attempted shots, on the way to 37 points, another Team USA record (breaking the 31 of Stephon Marbury set in the 2004 edition). Team USA won the gold medal as they defended their 2008 title against Spain, winning 107–100. Anthony's 16.3 points per game average were the second best for Team USA behind Kevin Durant's record–setting 19.5 points per game. Anthony's 23 made three–point shots were second–best to Durant's record 34 as they both broke the previous Team USA record of 17 made three–point shots. The entire team was named as recipient of the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year and being part of the team, Anthony received the award for the second time in his career.\n\nAnthony also played in the 2016 Olympic Games, his fourth straight stint in the Olympics, which was a record for a US male basketball player, breaking the old record of having played in three Olympiads that he shared with James and Robinson. Team USA won the gold medal when they beat Serbia, 96–66, in the championship game with Anthony becoming the first player in US men's basketball history to win three gold medals. During the team's 98–88 victory over Australia, Anthony scored a game–high 31 points in 35 minutes built around 11–21 field goal shooting, including 9–15 from three–point range. By scoring 31 points in that game, he became Team USA's scoring leader, breaking the old record of 273 points held by James. He also became the first US player to score 30 or more points in two Olympic Games. In the gold medal game against Serbia, Anthony collared seven rebounds to finish with 125 total rebounds in US Olympic history, passing Robinson as Team USA's all–time leader in most rebounds. In summary, Anthony caps his Olympic career as the first man to win three gold medals, career leader in scoring, rebounding and games played, with 31, thereby becoming USA basketball's most decorated Olympian. He finished the 2016 Rio Olympics with averages of 12.1 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.6 steals per game, built on 39% field goal shooting (33/84), 40% from three–point area (18/45), and 62% free throws (13/21). In recognition of his performances and accomplishments in the tournament, Anthony was named co–USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year (along with Kevin Durant) for the third time in his career.\n\nPlayer profile[]\n\nAnthony plays the Small Forward position, but he is also capable of playing Power Forward. His scoring prowess is considered his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end; he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33, and holds the New York Knicks single–game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for being a prolific scorer with a variety of crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6 ft 8 (2.03 m) and 238 pounds (108 kg), he has strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post. He also likes creating space from his defenders which allows him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line. Anthony is often known for being one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game–winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, \"If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, it would have to be Anthony.\" Despite being a prolific scorer, he has been criticized for his defense and has never been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team.\n\nAnthony is one of many NBA players who use Idan Ravin as a personal coach and trainer. His relationship with Ravin started when he was 18 years old and preparing for the NBA Draft after spending his one year at Syracuse University.\n\nCareer statistics[]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league\n\nNBA[]\n\nRegular season[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2003–04 Denver 82 82 36.5 .426 .322 .777 6.1 2.8 1.2 .5 21.0 2004–05 Denver 75 75 34.8 .431 .266 .796 5.7 2.6 .9 .4 20.8 2005–06 Denver 80 80 36.8 .481 .243 .808 4.9 2.7 1.1 .5 26.5 2006–07 Denver 65 65 38.2 .476 .268 .808 6.0 3.8 1.2 .4 28.9 2007–08 Denver 77 77 36.4 .492 .354 .786 7.4 3.4 1.3 .5 25.7 2008–09 Denver 66 66 34.3 .443 .371 .793 6.8 3.4 1.1 .4 22.8 2009–10 Denver 69 69 38.2 .458 .316 .830 6.6 3.2 1.3 .4 28.2 2010–11 Denver 50 50 35.5 .452 .333 .823 7.6 2.8 .9 .6 25.2 2010–11 New York 27 27 36.2 .461 .424 .872 6.7 3.0 .9 .6 26.3 2011–12 New York 55 55 34.1 .430 .335 .804 6.3 3.6 1.1 .4 22.6 2012–13 New York 67 67 37.0 .449 .379 .830 6.9 2.6 .8 .5 28.7* 2013–14 New York 77 77 38.7* .452 .402 .848 8.1 3.1 1.2 .7 27.4 2014–15 New York 40 40 35.7 .444 .341 .797 6.6 3.1 1.0 .4 24.2 2015–16 New York 72 72 35.1 .434 .339 .829 7.7 4.2 .9 .5 21.8 2016–17 New York 74 74 34.3 .433 .360 .833 5.9 2.9 .8 .4 22.4 2017–18 Oklahoma City 78 78 32.1 .404 .357 .767 5.8 1.3 .6 .6 16.2 2018–19 Houston 10 2 29.4 .405 .328 .682 5.4 .5 .4 .7 13.4 2019–20 Portland 58 58 32.8 .430 .385 .845 6.3 1.5 .8 .5 15.4 2020–21 Portland 69 3 24.5 .421 .409 .890 3.1 1.5 .7 .6 13.4 2021–22 L.A.

He had another sister, Michelle, who died in 2010. His mother, Mary, is African American and his father, Carmelo Iriarte, was Puerto Rican. In 2004, Anthony became engaged to Alani \"La La\" Vazquez. Their son, Kiyan Carmelo Anthony, was born on March 7, 2007. Michael Eric Dyson married Anthony and La La on July 10, 2010, at Cipriani's in New York City before 320 guests. VH1 filmed the ceremony for use in a reality series on the couple, titled La La's Full Court Wedding. Anthony resides in Portland, Oregon. He sold his New York City property in 2020. Shortly after the end of the 2016–17 regular season, TMZ reported that La La had moved out of the couple's apartment and the two were living separately. The two reconciled in December 2018. In June 2021, La La filed for divorce.\n\nControversies[]\n\nIn 2004, Anthony was cited for marijuana possession, after inspectors at Denver International Airport found marijuana in his backpack. Charges were later dropped after Anthony's friend, James Cunningham, of St. Louis, signed an affidavit taking responsibility for the marijuana. That same year, Anthony appeared in a video entitled Stop Snitchin', which warned that residents of Baltimore who collaborated with the police would face violence. Anthony later distanced himself from this video. In 2006, Anthony's friend, Tyler Brandon Smith, was pulled over in Anthony's vehicle and cited for marijuana possession and three traffic violations. Later that year on December 16, he was involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden. He was suspended for 15 games as a result.\n\nOn April 14, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on Interstate 25 in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights. Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who was alone in the car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a \"sober, responsible party.\" A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability–impaired. The original charge of driving while under the influence was dropped. He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community service, and US$1,000 in court costs and fines.\n\nHe has been criticized by South Bronx community activists for aligning himself with Mott Haven developer Keith Rubenstein's efforts to build luxury apartment buildings in the neighborhood, which could lead to gentrification.\n\nCharity work[]\n\nIn Denver, Anthony was a spokesman for the Family Resource Center and helped organize a Christmas party, entitled \"A Very Melo Christmas,\" for less well–off children. In Baltimore, Anthony hosts an annual 3–on–3 tournament, known as \"Melo's H.O.O.D. (Holding Our Own Destiny) Movement 3 on 3 Challenge\" and is helping fund the revitalization of a local community center for local youth. Anthony opened \"The Carmelo Anthony Youth Development Center\" in Baltimore on December 14, 2006. He contributed $1.5 million to the Living Classrooms Foundation, a non-profit organization that \"provides innovative hands–on–education, job–training, and community service programs for over 35,000 children, youth and young adults in the east Baltimore community\".\n\nAfter the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Anthony donated $35,000 to relief efforts.
