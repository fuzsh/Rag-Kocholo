        "text": "Background\n\nCarmello Kyam Anthony was born in Brooklyn, New York City, U.S., to parents Mary Anthony and Carmelo Iriarte. When Anthony was barely a few years old, the family moved to Baltimore. Unfortunately, his father tragically passed away, leaving his mother to care for him as well as his older siblings. He is the youngest of four kids.\n\nWhen he was a teenager, he was enrolled in a private boarding school called Oak Hill Academy in Virginia. He completed the first three years of high school at Towson Catholic High. He suddenly garnered popularity in the summer of 1999 when he became one of the best basketball players in his area. In 2001, he received the title of Baltimore Catholic League’s ‘Player of the Year.’ Thereafter, he attended Syracuse University and began his basketball career playing for the Orangemen.\n\nDuring his freshman year, he became a key part of his team and Syracuse bagged its first-ever victory in the 2013 National Championship. This feat only went on to prove that Anthony was now ready for the big leagues. As a result, he parted ways with Syracuse and became a part of the Denver Nuggets. In 2011, he joined the New York Knicks and then Oklahoma City Thunder in 2017. Anthony was also traded to the ‘Atlanta Hawks for a relatively short period of time. He currently plays for the Portland Trail Blazers, whom he joined back in 2019. Over the years, he has received a number of awards and titles due to his unparalleled success in the field."
