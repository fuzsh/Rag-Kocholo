        "text": "The sole leader of Olympic scoring, a gold medal will cement Anthony’s legacy in international competition lore\n\nCarmelo Anthony has a controversial career with questionable legacy choices. He left Syracuse University after one year — a championship year, and entered the 2003 NBA Draft. He forced a trade away from Denver that landed him in New York in 2011 instead of waiting until free agency.\n\nWith a basketball trajectory periodically scandalous, Anthony’s Olympic career is quite the opposite; Carmelo is a three-time medalist, earning gold in the last two Summer Olympics (2012 London, 2008 Beijing).\n\nHe is the ostentatious leader of the 2016 Rio squad that plays without Curry, LeBron, Westbrook, Chris Paul, or Wade, among the league’s American elite. He is also the sole possessor of the U.S. Men’s Olympic scoring total. He is on the verge earning a third gold medal — the only American athlete to do so in basketball. Carmelo Anthony is quite frankly the Olympics hoops G.O.A.T.\n\nThis isn’t my opinion or a freshly served hot take. Like the laws of physics and gravity, or the inevitability of a Dolan screw-up, Anthony’s international basketball history is etched into stone, forever carved to tell the stories of Olympic glory. He surpassed sneaker sponsor Michael Jordan on Monday, and David Robinson and his peer and friend LeBron James on Wednesday. The most points, the most gold medals, Carmelo’s dedication to the U.S. team is not an outlet to prove his basketball honor away from the NBA, but a way to express his respect among the cream of the crop around the league and love from fans around the world.\n\nHis only blemish was a part on the 2004 Athens team that finished third, and came home with a bronze medal, representative of a participation trophy or an “at least you tried” cake. That team’s failure propelled U.S. Olympic basketball into a new generation and new direction, one that now features Anthony as the vocal and mental leader.\n\nHis voice picks up on every NBC microphone and his character is shared among his teammates on the roster. He’s grown up floating on international waters and left Knicks fans emotional in the process of watching their All-Star. Personally, I couldn’t be prouder of a ‘Bocker who truly demonstrates what it means wearing the stars and stripes, and Anthony has down an astounding job. Besides accumulating accolades, Carmelo has solidified a legacy far more indicative of who he is as a person: a passionate and patriotic team player who’s at his peak when he’s enjoying the game.\n\nThe criticism has reached a boiling point really. Anthony has never played an NBA Finals game, nor has reached a Conference Finals match-up since 2009. Candidly, Carmelo’s teams have not even deserved to play that far into a season based on talent alone. But Carmelo’s Olympic teams have always been rich in talent and superstars. What makes his international career different?\n\nWell, he’s a leader, isn’t he? Anthony is the guy amongst guys. He is the one his teammates trust in any situation. Throughout his storied Olympic career, Carmelo has continuously been the scorer and the one setting the pace. In the first half of the Venezuela game in Rio, the U.S. was struggling to find rhythm and it wasn’t until ‘Melo checked back into the game for the boys in red, white, and blue to push the Venezuelans to a back-breaking, court-stretching limit. He bent defenses and called out plays like the commander-in-chief.\n\nHis points total may be vanquished in a decade but the three gold medals are achievements unlikely to be erased. Under the Colangelo regime, U.S. Basketball develops a select team — younger NBA protégés to replace the aged-out Olympic members (like Codename: Kids Next Door). So it’s terribly difficult to be on the A-Team for more than about the two Summer Olympics go-around. Carmelo will be on four of those teams: almost unheard of.\n\nEnamored by basketball lovers and well respected among his colleagues, Carmelo is a giant in the U.S. Basketball community. Anthony will forever be remembered as a three-time gold medalist and dedicated ambassador of hoops around the planet. He had the signature game against Nigeria, ten triples and a total of 37 points, a Team U.S.A. record. (Lagos needs to build a ‘Melo status yesterday.)\n\nWhile Carmelo still searches for an NBA chip, his legacy is firmly planted with the alloys hanging around his neck and the admirable words from his peers. From the Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan:\n\nCarmelo is the veteran and a super-likable guy. We got 12 Alphas in here. But he’s the leader of this team and we follow him.
