        "text": "Carmelo Anthony, the star forward who led Syracuse to an NCAA championship in his lone college season and went on to spend 19 years in the NBA, announced his retirement on Monday.\n\nAnthony, who was not in the NBA this season, retires as the No. 9 scorer in league history.\n\nOnly LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Dirk Nowitzki, Wilt Chamberlain and Shaquille O'Neal scored more than Anthony - who finishes his career with 28,289 points.\n\nAnthony's legacy has long been secure: He ends his playing days after being selected as one of the 75 greatest players in NBA history, a 10-time All-Star, a past scoring champion and a six-time All-NBA selection.\n\nAnd while he never got to the NBA Finals - he only played in the conference finals once, with Denver against the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 - Anthony also knew what it was like to be a champion.\n\nHe was the Most Outstanding Player of the 2003 Final Four when he led Syracuse to the national championship, and he helped USA Basketball win Olympic gold three times - at Beijing in 2008, at London in 2012 and at Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nAnthony has played in 31 games in four appearances at the Olympics, the most of any U.S. men's player ever. Anthony's 37 points against Nigeria in the 2012 games is a USA Basketball men's record at an Olympics, as are his 10 3-pointers from that game and his 13-for-13 effort from the foul line against Argentina in 2008.\n\nCarmelo Anthony Net Worth\n\nAnthony also played for Portland, Oklahoma City, Houston and ended his career with the Lakers last season. He went unsigned this year, and now his retirement is official.\n\nHe said in his retirement address that he's looking forward to watching the development of his son Kiyan, a highly rated high school shooting guard.\n\nCarmelo Anthony is a Brooklyn-born former professional basketball player who has a net worth of $160 million dollars. Anthony has been named an NBA All-Star ten times and an All-NBA Team member six times.\n\nOn May 22, 2023, Anthony announced his retirement from the NBA after a 19-year career in which he earned more than $262 million in salary alone.\n\nCarmelo Anthony to be Hall of Fame player\n\nAnthony was drafted No. 3 overall by Denver in 2003, part of the star-studded class that included James at No. 1, Hall of Famer Chris Bosh at No. 4, and soon-to-be Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade -- he gets officially enshrined this summer - at No. 5."
