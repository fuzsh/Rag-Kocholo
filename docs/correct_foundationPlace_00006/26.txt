Founded in 2007, genARTS Silicon Valley serves emerging arts and cultural leaders and bridges communication between emerging, midcareer, and established leaders through our programs and events.

Fiscally sponsored by SVCreates, genARTS is dedicated to assembling, supporting, and empowering a thriving community of arts and culture leaders who are prepared to guide and serve this regionâ€™s arts and culture community of tomorrow.

Focused locally on San Jose and Silicon Valley as a whole, we still maintain important statewide connections across California and keep an eye on the national conversations in the arts and culture sector, specifically through our connection to American for the Arts as a registered Local Emerging Leaders Network.

We highly value partnerships and collaboration, situating ourselves as the hub of a network of networks.

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation is a nonpartisan, private charitable foundation that advances ideas and supports institutions to promote a better world.

Established through the personal generosity of the Hewlett family, the foundation is wholly independent of the Hewlett Packard Company and the Hewlett Packard Company Foundation.
