        "text": "During its critical formative years, Raymond James expanded its service offerings, its workforce – even its workspace.\n\nTom James, the son of co-founder Bob James, joined the firm fresh out of Harvard Business School. Within a few short years, Raymond James had moved its client-first practice into an 8,000-square foot office.\n\nEager to build on a promising start, Raymond James moved confidently into its second decade.\n\nTom James, the son of founder Bob James, was named CEO at the start of the decade, and in 1973 Raymond James gained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, helping to ensure the best execution for clients.\n\nThe decade dawned as Raymond James posted its first year with net income of more than $1 million.\n\nBut bigger events were in store. In 1983, Raymond James celebrated a day many years in the making as the company went public with a $14-million initial public offering. While that celebration was both delayed and dampened by the untimely death of the firm’s founder Bob James in May of the same year, the firm’s employees were heartened by the strong future built on the father of financial planning’s legacy.\n\nDuring a decade of prosperity, Raymond James reached several milestones.\n\nIn 1994, Raymond James Bank was founded as a savings and loan association, enhancing the firm’s offerings to include the benefits of a national charter for advisors and client.\n\nFrom the beginning, Raymond James put clients first because it was the right thing to do.\n\nThat commitment was honored in 2008, when Forbes.com recognized the firm as one of America’s Most Trustworthy Companies and one of America’s Best Big Companies.*\n\n*The Forbes rankings for “America’s Most Trustworthy Companies,” are compiled by financial analytics company Audit Integrity after it assesses companies for the integrity of their operations. The Forbes rankings for the “400 Best Big Companies in America” are based on stringent criteria including accounting and governance ratings, revenue, positive equity, long-term earnings growth and debt-to-capital ratios.\n\nIn 2012, Raymond James celebrated 50 years of taking a personal approach to long-term financial planning.\n\nThe same year, the firm positioned itself for the future, joining forces with Morgan Keegan to become one of the nation’s largest wealth management and investment banking firms not located on Wall Street."
