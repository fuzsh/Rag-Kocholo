He argues that architecture is the physical creation of an atmosphere, serving to heighten our awareness of our natural surroundings. In doing so, we can learn how to be humane and treat humans, nature, and animals as all equal in a space. This sensitivity is visible in all his projects, for which he credits 50% of his design as being left to nature, allowing unexpected moments of interaction between humans and animals; these works invite their visitors to slow down and connect with nature.\n\nBeyond the realms of theory and practice, Premthada’s work also carries a strong socio-economic, cultural, and environmental agenda, as many of his projects have social programs that aim to improve the lives of the underprivileged and the ecosystem.\n\nWatch the recording\n\nMar. 4, 4:30 pm\n\nChandra Robinson\n\nChandra Robinson is a principal at Lever Architecture, a firm founded in Portland, Oregon by Thomas Robinson and Pamela Kislak in 2009.
