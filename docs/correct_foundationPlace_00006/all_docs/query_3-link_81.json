        "text": "TheatreWorks was founded by Stanford grad Robert Kelley in 1970, charged by the City of Palo Alto with developing new work by local youth in reaction to the unsettled times. The first show, Popcorn, was an original musical highlighting the clash between generations in the community. The company produced 13 original works in its first three years, many of them musicals, playing in parking garages, warehouses, outdoor amphitheatres—wherever space could be found.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, TheatreWorks had a strong regional profile, 30 full-time staffers, a 20-member Board of Trustees, 8500 subscribers, and an annual budget of $4.5 million. In 2001, determined to expand its commitment to new plays and musicals, the company launched the New Works Initiative. It would eventually include an annual New Works Festival and Writers’ Retreat, developmental workshops, commissions, and many mainstage world premieres, making it central to TheatreWorks’ mission and reputation.\n\nTheatreWorks’ New Works programs have attracted authors and composers of national stature, including Beth Henley, Paul Gordon, Marsha Norman, Rajiv Joseph, Henry Krieger, Stephen Schwartz, Duncan Sheik, Colman Domingo, Joe DiPietro, Jules Feiffer, Andrew Lippa, among many others. Their works, and scores of others developed here, have gone on to many regional, Broadway, and international productions. The 2010 Tony Award-winning musical Memphis was first developed in the Festival, and then premiered at TheatreWorks in 2004. Stephen Schwartz’ new musical The Prince of Egypt had its world premiere here in 2017 and will debuted London’s West End in early 2020. TheatreWorks presented its Paul Gordon’s Pride and Prejudice, the company’s 70th world premiere ,in December 2019, directed by Founding Artistic Director Robert Kelley in his 50th year with the company.\n\nAt the start of TheatreWorks’ 50th Anniversary Season the company received the Regional Theatre Tony Award, a testament to the passion and imaginative spirit of many. TheatreWorks’ leadership dedicated this award to the thousands of brilliant theatre artists, fiercely committed staff and trustees, and the community of subscribers and supporters who have shared our work for half a century."
