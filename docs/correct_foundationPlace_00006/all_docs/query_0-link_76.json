        "text": "Communications\n\nChemComm Communications are for the publication of urgent research which is of outstanding significance and interest to experts in the field, while also appealing to the journal’s general chemistry readership. Our Communication format (up to 4 journal pages in length) is ideally suited to short studies - which can be preliminary in nature - that are of such importance that they require accelerated publication.\n\nAuthors should write in a clear and concise way. Lengthy introductions and discussion, extensive data, and excessive experimental details and conjecture should not be included. Figures and tables will be published only if they are essential to understanding the work. The experimental evidence necessary to support the work described should be supplied as electronic supplementary information (ESI). However the ESI should not be used to include key results or discussion that do not fit within the 4 pages of the main text – articles of this type would be better suited to a full paper journal where there is space to include all key information in the main text.\n\nAuthors should use our Communication template for preparing their submissions. On submission authors are also asked to provide:\n\nA statement indicating why the work should be published in ChemComm. This should include the significance and novelty of the work, and why it is of interest to the wide general readership of ChemComm.\n\nDetails of 5 suitable referees\n\nFeature articles\n\nChemComm Feature Articles are reviews written by leading scientists on topics which are of significant interest to the journal’s general chemistry readership.\n\nA Feature Article is not a typical review. It highlights the author’s contribution to a key field; however it should also include a balanced discussion of related work from other laboratories to set the author’s contribution within a wider context. A Feature Article should not contain original research.\n\nA Feature Article should generally include:\n\nA background to the research area; its importance and previous developments\n\nA summary of the key aspects of the research recently published by the author\n\nAn outlook on future progression of the field, including how the author’s research could impact that.\n\nFeature articles are generally between 10 and 16 pages in length, although longer articles may be acceptable after consultation with the editorial board. They can include photographs and brief biographies (max 100 words) for up to six authors, which should be supplied prior to acceptance. Authors are encouraged to use the article template for submission.\n\nFeature articles in ChemComm are normally submitted by invitation; however we are happy to consider unsolicited submissions.\n\nHighlights\n\nHighlights are short, review-style articles that provide a balanced overview of the last 10 years of progress in a key field. They should appeal to ChemComm’s broad chemistry readership, and introduce non-specialists to fields that will continue to be important for the next generation of chemists.\n\nHighlights should be written in an accessible way to appeal to research chemists (post-graduate level and higher) who are non-specialists in the field. They should stress the importance of the field to the chemists of today and the future, and authors are encouraged to give their view on how the field should develop.\n\nWhile major contributions in an area should be highlighted, extensive referencing is not appropriate for Highlights, and new results should not be presented. Highlights can include photographs and brief biographies (max 100 words) for up to six authors, which should be supplied prior to acceptance. Authors are encouraged to use the article template for submission.\n\nComments\n\nComments and Replies are a medium for the discussion and exchange of scientific opinions between authors and readers concerning material published in ChemComm.\n\nFor publication, a Comment should present an alternative analysis of and/or new insight into the previously published material. Any Reply should further the discussion presented in the original article and the Comment. Comments and Replies that contain any form of personal attack are not suitable for publication.\n\nComments that are acceptable for publication will be forwarded to the authors of the work being discussed, and these authors will be given the opportunity to submit a Reply. The Comment and Reply will both be subject to rigorous peer review in consultation with the journal’s Editorial Board where appropriate. The Comment and Reply will be published together.\n\nExperimental guidelines\n\nExperimental information must be provided to enable other researchers to reproduce accurately the work. The experimental details and the characterisation data should preferably be provided as electronic supplementary information (ESI), although on occasion it may be appropriate to include some or all of this within the body of the communication. This will depend on the nature of the research being reported.\n\nThe synthesis of all new compounds must be described in detail. Synthetic procedures must include the specific reagents, products and solvents and must give the amounts (g, mmol, for products: %) for all of them, as well as clearly stating how the percentage yields are calculated. They must also include all the characterisation data for the prepared compound or material. For multistep synthesis papers, spectra of key compounds and the final product should be included. For a series of related compounds, at least one representative procedure which outlines a specific example that is described in the text or in a table and which is representative for the other cases must be provided.\n\nCharacterisation of new compounds & computational results\n\nCharacterisation of new compounds\n\nIt is the responsibility of authors to provide fully convincing evidence for the homogeneity, purity and identity of all compounds they claim as new. This evidence is required to establish that the properties and constants reported are those of the compound with the new structure claimed. Referees will assess, as a whole, the evidence presented in support of the claims made by the authors. The requirements for characterisation criteria are detailed below.\n\nOrganic compounds\n\nAuthors are required to provide unequivocal support for the purity and assigned structure of all compounds using a combination of the following characterisation techniques.\n\nAnalytical\n\nElemental analysis (within ±0.4% of the calculated value) is required to confirm 95% sample purity and corroborate isomeric purity. Authors are also requested to provide copies of 1H,13C NMR spectra and/or GC/HPLC traces; however, if satisfactory elemental analysis cannot be obtained, copies of these spectra and/or traces must be provided. For libraries of compounds, HPLC traces should be submitted as proof of purity. The determination of enantiomeric excess of nonracemic, chiral substances should be supported with either GC/HPLC traces with retention times for both enantiomers and separation conditions (that is, chiral support, solvent and flow rate) or for Mosher Ester/Chiral Shift Reagent analysis, copies of the spectra.\n\nPhysical\n\nImportant physical properties - for example, boiling or melting point, specific rotation, refractive index - including conditions and a comparison to the literature for known compounds should be provided. For crystalline compounds, the method used for recrystallisation should also be documented (that is, solvent etc).\n\nSpectroscopic\n\nMass spectra and a complete numerical listing of 1H,13C NMR peaks in support of the assigned structure, including relevant 2D NMR and related experiments (that is, NOE, etc) is required. As noted in 'Analytical', authors are requested to provide copies of these spectra. Infrared spectra that support functional group modifications, including other diagnostic assignments, should be included. High-resolution mass spectra are acceptable as proof of the molecular weight providing the purity of the sample has been accurately determined as outlined above.\n\nPolymers\n\nFor all soluble polymers, an estimation of molecular weight must be provided by a suitable method - for example, size exclusion chromatography, including details of columns, eluents and calibration standards, intrinsic viscosity, MALDI TOF, etc. In addition, full NMR characterisation (1H,13C) as for organic compound characterisation (see 'Organic compounds' in this section) should be included. Small molecules on the route to the polymers should be characterised as above and NMR data should be tabulated.\n\nInorganic and organometallic compounds\n\nA new chemical substance (molecule or extended solid) should have a homogeneous composition and structure. Where the compound is molecular, authors must provide data to unequivocally establish its homogeneity, purity and identification. In general, this should include elemental analyses that agree to within ±0.4% of the calculated values. In cases where elemental analyses cannot be obtained (for example, for thermally unstable compounds), justification for the omission of this data should be provided. Note that an X-ray crystal structure is not sufficient for the characterisation of a new material, since the crystal used in this analysis does not necessarily represent the bulk sample.\n\nIn rare cases, it may be possible to substitute elemental analyses with high-resolution mass spectrometric molecular weights. This is appropriate, for example, with trivial derivatives of thoroughly characterised substances or routine synthetic intermediates. In all cases, relevant spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, UV-vis, etc) should be provided in tabulated form or as reproduced spectra. These may be relegated to the electronic supplementary information (ESI) to conserve journal space. However, it should be noted that, in general, mass spectrometric and spectroscopic data do not constitute proof of purity, and, in the absence of elemental analyses, additional evidence of purity should be provided (melting points, PXRD data, etc).\n\nWhere the compound is an extended solid, it is important to unequivocally establish the chemical structure and bulk composition. Single crystal diffraction does not determine the bulk structure. Referees will normally look to see evidence of bulk homogeneity. A fully indexed powder diffraction pattern that agrees with single crystal data may be used as evidence of a bulk homogeneous structure, and chemical analysis may be used to establish purity and homogeneous composition.\n\nMagnetic measurements\n\nIf data from magnetic measurements are presented, the manuscript must provide a thorough description of the experimental details pertaining to how the sample was measured (in a gelatin capsule, Teflon capsule, as a powder, etc). If the data have been corrected for sample or sample-holder diamagnetism, the diamagnetic correction term must be provided and the manner in which it was determined (for example, calculated using Pascal’s constants, measured) must be stated.\n\nAny fit of magnetic data [for example, χ(T), χ(1/T), χT(T), μ(T), M(H), etc] to an analytical expression must be accompanied by the Hamiltonian from which the analytical expression is derived, the analytical expression itself, and the fitting parameters. If the expression is lengthy, it may be included in the electronic supplementary information instead of within the main manuscript text. Its inclusion as supplementary information should be noted in the electronic supplementary information paragraph at the end of the manuscript. When an exchange coupling constant (J) is quoted in the abstract, the form of the Hamiltonian must also be included in the abstract.\n\nNano-sized materials (such as quantum dots, nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires)\n\nIt is essential that the authors not only provide detailed characterisation on individual objects (see 'Inorganic and organometallic compounds') but also a comprehensive characterisation of the bulk composition. Characterisation of the bulk of the sample could require determination of the chemical composition and size distribution over large portions of the sample.\n\nBiomolecules (for example, enzymes, proteins, DNA/RNA, oligosaccharides, oligonucleotides)\n\nAuthors should provide rigorous evidence for the identity and purity of the biomolecules described. The techniques that may be employed to substantiate identity include the following.\n\nMass spectrometry\n\nLC-MS\n\nSequencing data (for proteins and oligonucleotides)\n\nHigh field 1H,13C NMR spectroscopy\n\nX-ray crystallography\n\nPurity must be established by one or more of the following.\n\nHPLC\n\nGel electrophoresis\n\nCapillary electrophoresis\n\nHigh field 1H,13C NMR spectroscopy\n\nSequence verification also needs to be carried out for nucleic acid cases involving molecular biology including all mutants; for new protein or gene sequences, the entire sequence must be provided. For organic synthesis involving DNA, RNA oligonucleotides, their derivatives or mimics, purity must be established using HPLC and mass spectrometry as a minimum.\n\nFor new derivatives comprising modified monomers, the usual organic chemistry analytical requirements for the novel monomer must be provided (see 'Organic compounds'). However, it is not necessary to provide this level of characterisation for the oligonucleotide into which the novel monomer is incorporated.\n\nComputational results\n\nAuthors must provide sufficient information to enable readers to reproduce any computational results. If software was used for calculations and is generally available, it must be properly cited in the notes and references. References to the methods upon which the software is based must also be provided. Equations, data, geometric parameters/coordinates, or other numerical parameters essential to reproduction of the computational results (or adequate references when available in the open literature) must be provided. Authors who report the results of electronic structure calculations in relative energies should also include in electronic supplementary information the absolute energies obtained directly from the computational output files. Computational results obtained using methods, parameters, or input data that are not adequately described in the manuscript or in the referenced literature are not acceptable for publication."
