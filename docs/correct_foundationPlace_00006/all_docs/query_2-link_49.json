        "text": "Lost Woods is a duo exhibition created by Nathan Harper and Babak Ahteshamipour. The work explores digital identity and artificial intelligence set in a mythical setting placed within an appropriated digital location from a popular video game. This space (The Lost Woods) is a mythical space between worlds with fluid identity, much like the digital objects in the exhibition.\n\nBabak produces paintings of \"evil beings\" that harken back to ancient demonology illustrations but contain the signifiers of contemporary sources such as films and video games. He attempts to deconstruct various beings such as ghosts or the reaper or the jackalope since they have a trace of signified meanings and connections to various situations, emotions, identities, abstract notions or behaviors (i.e. ghosting) and cultural constructs. In this exhibition, he includes an image of these physical paintings and a digital reconstruction of the beings in 3D. They serve as an enemy NPC while still referencing a life outside of cyberspace as physical artifacts.\n\nIn conversation with these NPCs are Nathan's A.I.-generated hedgehogs. These Hedgehogs are produced using a neural network called a generative adversarial network (most famously known for the This Person Does Not Exist Generator) trained on hundreds of images of Sonic the Hedgehog fan characters. These aviators serve as self-inserts into the fictional world, but Harper disconnects them from human input and fully gives them over to nonhuman vision. The A.I. even names these works by giving a text generator the titles of Babak's works nearest to them and allowing the generator to provide the following line. All of the titles then string together to create a sci-fi / mystical pseudo-narrative that is a duet between human and machine thinking.\n\nThe fires that burn are never the ones that were meant to burn\n\nThe splash of the knife in the water rings out over the assembly as if it was the shattering of a hundred crystal chandeliers\n\nOccupy determined neural systems district and take action to get rid of them\n\nThe pure white of the flowing robe he wears in his place shows stark against the blood that stains his heart\n\nOccupy sad neural systems district and cry to get rid of them\n\nWe will end all of your fears and bring you into a new world of peace and harmony\n\nIt Sims, after all, we couldn’t escape the game engines of power\n\n‘It’s a button for a portal,’ she says, handing me her phone\n\nOccupy scary neural systems district and flee to get rid of them\n\nWe all turn our heads\n\nSmashing things might be fun until you get yourself back in time\n\nTo then have to go through all of those problems again\n\nA woman has dropped a clay vase to the floor and is now sitting on the floor, a surge of electricity shooting from her body and scorching the floor around her\n\nOccupy angry neural systems district and shout to get rid of them\n\nFor one thing they did almost nothing until one of them \"merged\" with another\n\n[A BRICK AS A CATALYST]\n\nIn 1969, a single brick in a New York street became a symbol, shattering the silence suffocating the Queer community. The Stonewall Uprising marked a pivotal moment for bringing forth the needs of LGBTTTIQ+ individuals worldwide, igniting a global discussion on LGBTQ rights and liberation. It catalyzed a broader movement for equality, fostering a collective awareness that the fight for justice and acceptance transcends borders and unites us all in our pursuit of a more inclusive and compassionate world.\n\n[A BRICK AS AN ECHO]\n\n54 years have passed since this first brick was thrown and our resistance continues, everywhere. While there have been many gains, there is still a long way to go. Queer artists have mobilized their creativity to transmute towards a reality where we can all authentically express who we are. The artists in this exhibition, remind us that queerness is expansive in its multiplicity. There is strength in the rich diversity of our expressions, each, like a building brick of our history. These works are statements, memories, and visions of present-futures where queerness continues to be defiant in its existence.\n\n[A BRICK AS A STRATEGY]\n\nThe works presented raise questions such as: What does queer art look like? How does queerness manifest? And, how can digital art draw on the legacy of public protest? They are all brought together by a shared sentiment—an unyielding urge for protest, an unwavering spirit of dissidence, and a ceaseless pursuit of queer world-building.\n\nThis exhibition presents one strategy of continuing the inertia began by the first brick. A public ritual demonstrating one of the myriad of ways we rise up, resist, and resonate. As you journey through these “digital bricks” consider each piece as a digital catalyst, pixelated potential reverberating echoes of a brick thrown half a century ago. Think of these works as a fierce declaration, a celebration, and a testament to the resiliency and multiplicity of queer art and activism.\n\n[THESE ARE OUR DIGITAL BRICKS]\n\nThis exhibition results from an open call for queer artists online to share their work during Pride Month 2023. As a digital artist and queer activist, I asked myself how I could utilize the tools at my access to build a bridge between the virtual and the physical planes. Guerrilla projecting these works in public spaces channels the potentiality of that moment when the first brick was thrown. A visual detonation in the public sphere, ensuring that the spirit of that act of defiance, that bold declaration of existence and resistance, remains alive.\n\nWelcome to Schemata 3.0 - Exquisite World!\n\nLaunching in room 1 today 8pm BST\n\n4NOTE, Four Noiseiceni of the Eppocalypse\n\nBy physically being present in the forest we question our place in the digital world, we open our curiosity towards our own symbiotic relationship to what is “natural”. By recording ourselves using digital formats we add a layer of interpretation, to inspire an exploration into the connection between nature and noise, chaos and natural systems. The presence of the machine amongst complex eco systems allows us to explore human interference and also the nature of our naturalness as transmitters of sound, as physical beings of chaos. Here we embody all these things and we adopt our own language and modes of communication with each other through sound. The transition between the natural world and that of the digital is complex and fascinating and by experiencing this through a digital format we acknowledge the temporal dimensions that we have created. There is a distinct layer of experience that is denied in the digital but when the performance is experienced on this layer it opens a dialogue that can influence our experience and connection to the great forest and we can contribute our physical presence somehow down the line.\n\nMembers:\n\n(Iceni names)\n\nBoudica II: Electric Buddugloo\n\nAesu Death Maschina\n\nAntedios War Slaughter\n\nSaenu Pestilent brutality General\n\n(real names)\n\nTim Drage\n\nLisa McKendrick\n\nCalum F.

Showcasing artists and curators working with sound and technology whose work comes together to speculate on the potential of virtual space to imagine future worlds.\n\nSince the creation of virtual worlds, the digital has been recognised as a versatile and accessible tool for world building practices. Conversations around world building have exploded over the past few years and become endemic to the art world amongst other sectors. With current world events taking yet another dark turn, we return to this conversation, asking what and how artists can imagine for a future world.\n\nExquisite World maps out visions and dreams for a future world; it is a cartographic tool to consider what aspects of contemporary living could continue to be important moving forward: ecology, sex, technology, culture, history, and data are all recurring themes in public conversation right now. How will they be embodied in future worlding practices? What should change, and what should remain the same?\n\nExquisite World takes its premise from the iconic game of the Surrealists, Exquisite Corpse, aligning with the idea that world building be a collaborative process consistently adapting and evolving from what has come before. The work is never finished, and we are perpetually pushed forward in our desire for things being otherwise.\n\nA world by Christian Jago, presenting new photographic works and soundscapes across six chapters. Best experienced on desktop or tablet, with sound on.\n\n“Ephemeral Bloom” takes us on a journey of change through an imagined valley called Athrú. We witness how this space evolves over time, how it is affected by the seasons, and how natural processes contribute to its circle of life. The project is a reflection on nature and the lessons it has taught me about my mental health.\n\nI started this work wanting to heal my internal struggles, looking for answers in the world around me. Nature is an inspiring and complex force, linking all life forms in a delicate equilibrium. It is defined by change, constantly adapting as the earth evolves, and has reminded me of my own growth and perseverance. Just as nature resiliently faces challenges, so too can I navigate the landscape of my mind.\n\nBy channelling my emotions and experiences into the idyllic image of a valley, my work reveals a nexus of life and colour, representing the sanctuary I find within nature. But as spaces shift and converge, a fragile and fleeting world is suggested, reflecting the temporality of our interconnected planet.\n\nNature is remarkable for the way it supports and sustains itself, and numerous studies show that connecting with it has profound benefits for our mental health. Recognising my place in its vast web has helped me to feel less alone with my struggles, reassuring me that I am part of something bigger. Consequently, my work has evolved into a personal space of refuge.\n\nThe story of Athrú is divided into seasons, both of nature and the mind. Seasons mirror a duality of constancy and mutability - as nature seasons, so does the mind, each evolution an echo of growth. The narrative of the seasons teach us to cherish moments of bliss, and remind us of the transient nature of struggles.\n\nLearning about nature has helped me to understand the threat we pose to its rhythms and cycles. Our species’ inclination to control and contain often disturbs the natural symphony of change and nurturance within and around us. To prevent irreversible damage, we need to learn how to pause and retreat, both from ourselves and our planet. Athrú resembles a space where human interference does not exist, offering a window into a possible future.\n\nUltimately, nature has taught me to embrace change and to acknowledge the gradual process of healing. Connecting with it has reminded me of my responsibility to our symbiotic relationship. Embodied in a constellation of images, “Ephemeral Bloom” is both a personal memoir and a love letter to our shared world.\n\nMinting a 3D object on OpenSea, or Foundation enables the object interactive functionality. Once minted, the object appears to float in blank space allowing users to orbit it as they please. Whilst the only decipherable characteristic about the space the object inhabits is lighting, it's unclear if it’s in a space at all. Assuming a promise of Web3 is transparency, platforms should thus be neutral administrators of assets onto the ledger. But what if 3D assets were placed in a modeled environment the user couldn’t initially see? One must then question how this environment packages the non-fungible token, and what implications unseen spatial-identity might impose on the artist object, if any at all?\n\nPlatforms of Web3 allowing 3D objects to be minted in GLB and GLTF formats place these objects in a distinct virtual space, however, one can only see this space if a reflective sphere were uploaded through their protocol. Upon doing so, a spherical orb becomes a convex lens into a construct of the NFT gallery. At first glance this construct doesn’t appear to be anything spectacular— it’s proximity to online viewing rooms, and familiar cubic architecture suggest one might hang a rectangular image on the wall, or place an object on a plinth. In this case, it’s a dull assumption of what space digital art objects might exist in. Reproduced across platforms and presumably unintentional, the space itself is the color gray, situating it between the black box of cinema and the white cube gallery. As non-fungible tokens might already occupy a gray area, this gray feels like a fresh coat of paint on a room primed for transition. Therefore, this discovery functions as a prompt for artistic intervention.\n\nNow Fungible, is an interactive work created by Jason Isolini and hosted by New Art City. Using techniques of panoramic stitching, mapping, and re-mapping it appropriates a previously unseen virtual space that’s secretly been the habitat for most 3D objects minted through a blockchain platform. Whether intermediary, or code-binding, this environment encapsulates orbital NFT’s camouflaged as empty browser space. Now Fungible is a conversational forum for visual, additive, or subtractive gesture. It is a space of contemplation, commencement, and re-organization for active users to explore off-chain. What does one do with this space now that it’s been revealed? While questions await to be pried, Now Fungible offers an environment to build upon, or not.\n\nMuch like Marcel Duchamp’s work Étant donnés, the reflective sphere exposing a virtual diorama functions as a peephole within an exterior interface. Thus, the reflective sphere-as-aperture solidifies platform dimensionality as a barrier of Web3. However, it is not forgotten that Duchamp provided instructions for the assembly and disassembly of his work. In this way, Now Fungible treats the appropriated diorama as an unfixed manual for user operation— one that calls for the deliberation of the suggested replica. Additionally, one should consider this work a camera obscura— It is a question of this simulated environment as a generator of the image itself, and therefore an apparatus of Web3. One must consider the projection of the image from within the diorama as an exposure of the NFT.\n\nIn collaboration with New Art City a custom UI has been built specifically for this show. Every element of this environment is modifiable, as well as a new drag-and-drop function on this menu page allowing any active user to contribute to the work. Rather than thinking of the blockchain as cubic storage space, Now Fungible proposes artists, and spectators consider it a living room.\n\nMind Flaying Flavored Flails is a duo exhibition created by Nathan Harper and Babak Ahteshamipour for Babak’s album of the same title released on the cassette label Jollies (Brooklyn, NYC) on the 18th of November of 2022. The exhibition features five collaborative installations set on a futuristic garden ship on an alien landscape in space exploring themes regarding climate change, technocracy, the internet and pop culture. The installations are built around each of the individual tracks of the album which play respectively at each vicarious location. The exhibition is designed in such a way to create a non-linear experience, lacking a beginning, middle and end. It follows the idea of the non-linear compositional structures of the tracks of the album. Both Nathan and Babak used old works of theirs which they recreated some of them in 3D, gesturing towards recycling, reusing and recontextualizing which are of significance in artificial intelligence and ecology.\n\nBabak’s presence in the installations is highlighted with paintings of nonhuman beings — and their 3D versions — such as a bear in a racing kart from the video game \"Crash Bandicoot Nitro Fueled\" surrounded by Pepsi cans, a shark inside a broken washing machine and a black unicorn, and spell icons from the MMORPG \"World of Warcraft\" and their names showcased via 3D logos of the famous video game \"DOOM\" and the famous death metal band \"Death\" — in response to Nathan’s use of the band’s logo in his works. Babak explores and underlines the fetishistic overproduction and overconsumption of material commodities, imagery, online data and commodified art — fantasy franchises, video games and feel-good music — which reflect the capitalist realist lifestyle and overwhelms in decisive manners the relationship between human and nonhuman, present and future. Moreover Babak’s piece entitled \"I’d Rather be Banished to the Void than to Accept Disturbing Facts\" occupies the center of the space and features a black hole on which Skeletor — the main antagonist of the Masters of the Universe franchise — is banishing a ghoul from the Warcraft franchise, referencing to the famous Skeletor memes that mention disturbing facts, a clear indication to climate change denial, as it is an occurring theme in his works.\n\nIn conversation with Babak’s works are Nathan's dirt sheet prints and paintings — printed with dirt pigment which he made by gathering actual dirt — which are presented as preserved organic artifacts in a post-doomsday context showcasing the absurdity of the age of the internet based on their depicted context. They feature various imagery which Nathan found online and printed including extreme metal band logos, cartoon characters, skeletons, slogans, animals and DeviantArt style art. Additionally Nathan’s Tesla Trucks entitled \"Southern Girls do it Better\" which feature a texture with an imprint of Gadget Hackwrench — from the popular 1980s cartoon \"Chip n’Dale Rescue Rangers\" — and a logo from an extreme metal band, have been sucked in the alien terrain beneath and around the black hole in the center of the space, ironically reminding us of Elon Musk’s (Tesla’s founder) obsession over colonizing Mars, an average technocrat's dream. Lastly Nathan’s use of the logo of the famous death metal \"Death\" appears once again, this time as a fossilized piece of organic artifact, a piece that future generations would find and attempt to decipher, just like the Rosetta Stone or the Cyrus Cylinder, deciphering a yet past era of time that still has not passed.\n\nYou can listen / buy the album here: https://babakahteshamipour.bandcamp.com/album/mind-flaying-flavored-flails\n\nThe Day We Intertwined: New Art City at FLAME TP Video Art Fair\n\nIn such an alien space, we evolve within a dual reality.\n\nA space where isolation brings unity, publicness triggers deep intimacy; where organisms coalesce with machines, and diverse bodies are appreciated without avatars.\n\nIn such an alien space, we present our fragility for greater strength.\n\n▎FLAME TP Video Art Fair Schedule & Location (Taipei Time)\n\nVIP Preview: 08.26 12PM - 8PM\n\nPublic Exhibition: 08.27 & 08.28, 11PM - 7PM\n\nLocation: Hotel COZZI Zhongxiao Taipei\n\n▎Artist Lineup\n\nHenrique Fagundes\n\nSammie Veeler\n\nZhao, Tian-lin\n\n▎Artist Talk Schedule\n\n08.26 9AM(Taipei) / 08.25 6PM(LA) / 08.25 10PM(Brazil)\n\n▎Curator\n\nUGLYKIKI, Kat Sung\n\nVirtual Exhibition design by Kat Sung\n\nIn New Art City, a virtual exhibition toolkit founded in 2020, artists experiment with cyberspace as an extension of identity and expressive consciousness through building \"Worlds” and “Rooms” where artworks can be accessed publicly without the barrier of time and space. By exhibiting 3D models and interactive objects that reflect the possibilities of a fully-customized, artist-owned room, artists Henrique Fagundes, Zhao Tian-lin, and Sammie Veeler explore the idea of intertwined realities through the hyper-awareness of digital experiences.\n\nIn Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (2022), Henrique Fagundes envisions the future of the metaverse while critiquing it in the context of western cyberpunk ideals. Retrieving his family’s histories and positioning themselves in a “cyberFUNK” futuristic scenario in Brazil, Fagundes questions the ownership of the human future and digitized bodies by creating a black comedy-style virtual Brazil, where poor and dissident people can be purchased as NFPs (Non-Fungible Person). While rewriting the context of his and his loved ones’ existence, Fagundes finds that imagining a sense of belonging in a future setting to be a challenge. In a world where advanced interconnectedness is marketed and supposedly assured, feelings of isolation and abandonment permeate throughout the space. Upon this realization, Fagundes dreams of a harmonic coexistence between organisms and machines, a sanctuary where all that is truly precious remains safe and unforgotten.\n\nThe antidotes for the ambiguous ownership and struggling animal-nature-machine relationship of digitized future is rooted in Zhao Tian-lin’s Transcendence Plan (2022). Like Henrique Fagundes’s hope that “mammal and computers live in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky ”(quote from a poem by Richard Brautigan), Zhao Tian-lin has a vision of reconstructing new versions of ourselves in the present and near future. Through their intimate experiences with others on spiritual hypnosis journeys, Zhao Tian-lin’s ‘Digital Sarira’(數位舍利子) presents the results of their transforming consciousness. Zhao Tian-lin liberates people from the old memories and human histories burdened within the body, while regaining the original pure essence of soul, and thus a new earth is born.\n\nWholeness emerges from fractals. Under an artist’s imagination of intertwined realities, an interconnected self-awareness has evolved from digital intimacy. In Sammie Veeler’s artwork Gyre(2021), viewers travel freely inside the rising gyre of gender euphoria and dysphoria, and traverse through moments of abstracted reflections. As a dedicated Worldbuilder in New Art City, Sammie Veeler experiments with cybernavigation as interactive poetry and an exploration of self. Sammie Veeler’s Gyre(2021) levitates viewers through the acts of vulnerability and introspection in a transitioning self-awareness. A human face, a bond bursts from your gaze, and so is the portrait of a machine made clearer by our every single diving into the network and cyberspace.\n\n\"The Day We Intertwined\" is curated by digital media artist UGLYKIKI, and Kat Sung from New Art City.\n\nSet 5 seconds into the future, when humans have become reliant on recommends. When human influence has become extinct and the only examples of how and what to be are based on the selected stereotype options presented on the splash screen of our latest interactive lifestyle platform, we have only a limited palette of computer generated influence remaining.\n\nOur algorithmic options logs have informed a narrower and increasingly simplified data set, making life so much easier and rendering imagination obsolete and autonomy merely a user selectable feature, which in reality is just a cosmetic avatar accessory.\n\nAuto.Corp is a show based around a fantasy future big corporation, created to relieve humans of the tiresome burden of choice and decisions.\n\nIt is a human-curated mimeograph of AI in its infancy, designed to expose how we overlook the fact that everything the computer spits out at us is based on the prompts we input. We are the programmers. We are the data providers. Constantly, we submit our personal preferences and details and yet expect a resulting CG outcome that is somehow original!\n\nAuto.corp presents human-generated imagery (HGI), it contains digital place-holder art produced by anonymous art collective\n\nAnti.Gang, featuring artists A.n0nE and i.n0onE and as standard, emphasis is placed on exceptional audio quality and I’m excited to collaborate with contributing sound artist Ruaridh Law (@ruaridhlaw - https://ruaridhTVO.com) to sculpt the soundscapes in these spaces,\n\ntaking inspiration from cliches of new-age and utopian sci-fi sound design, and then both hyper-stretching, then super-compressing the results into something new.\n\nCreated as an analogue interpretation, an organic dupe, of GANs, by contrast to adversarial computer networks it is HAI (Human Actual Intelligence) Neural Network, opposing AAI (Actual Artificial Intelligence) Network, i.e me versus my computer, to produce what AI would create given the prompts CULTURE, IDENTITY, UTOPIA.\n\nAuto.corp consists of three worlds. Each a “penny in the slot” “pay as you go” experiential package, delivering micro-servings of fantasy aesthetic experiences. It questions the use of the morpheme “Auto” within contemporary life and uses it as a vehicle to explore our relationship with daily voluntary and involuntary actions and their effects on us, our evolution and our society. (Once we’ve handed everything over to an automated system to generate our lives, what will we do with all our time?)\n\nThere are over 1000 words with the prefix “auto” and although the stem is derived from the greek “autos” to mean self, it quickly morphed, becoming less and less about self and more about controlling the self and “automating” i.e. removing control. Indeed in the 1600s the term “autarky” (meaning self-sufficient) split to also become “autarchy” (meaning absolute sovereignty) emphasising the absolute dichotomy of eliciting ideals of consent and (self) control in a society built on foundations of hierarchy, dominance and submission.\n\n山人山，山合山\n\nBeing Oe Between\n\n互動性虛擬場景、3D模型、電腦合成影像、3D掃描、人的聲音\n\nInteractive virtual space, 3D model, Computer-generated imagery,3D scanning, human voice\n\n2022\n\n人生活山之間，山緊黏著山。\n\n創作者在台灣東部生活的幾年，總是耳聞有關台灣都蘭山的一些描述，不論是在文化、精神、信仰上的一些內容，不知不覺開始對都蘭山產生好奇，並開始了這次的藝術作品『山人山，山合山』，創作者從各個面向去剖析、探查、經驗、感受這座山，並也開始去思考有關人之於山，所生產的故事、意念、想像，它的背後是隱含了什麼樣的狀態?\n\n圍繞在台東的山相當多，像是中央山脈、四格山、鑾山等，其中都蘭山被現今當地住民視為相當重要的山，對於住在都蘭山西南邊的普悠瑪部落來說，都蘭山可能是其中一隻遷徙路線的發祥地，而對於住在都蘭山東側的都蘭部落而言，都蘭山是山神。\n\n都蘭山對於幾千年前的人來說，似乎也有關聯的可能，卑南遺址從1945年歷經多次調查、搶救、發 掘，出土許多台灣史前人類的物質遺留，這些物質遺留可以說明，卑南遺址是台灣罕見的大型史前 聚落。卑南遺址發掘出幾千具幾千年前的人，他們個別趟在由石板拼接而成的長形空間，他們躺下 的方向都是東北-西南的走向，死者的腳朝著東北，也就是坐起後，他們都面向都蘭山。 西元2003年「卑南遺址與都蘭山」入選為臺灣世界遺產潛力點，入選的原因大致上為:都蘭山可能 為史前族群的聖山、應將遺址與都蘭山納入調查研究、保護區域等，其中都蘭山是史前族群聖山的 關鍵說法，正是死者的方向一致都面向都蘭山，但這終究是現代人的詮釋，還是史前真相?其中有 許多細節值得被疏離及探討，然而本件作品主要探究的是，「卑南遺址與都蘭山」這個命題的背後 邏輯及脈絡。\n\n這件作品是由創作者駐地生活，與當地原住民聊天、訪談，並多次爬都蘭山，把身體與山的互動， 以及與人的交流作為重要材料，並以3D掃描、聲音、數位影像等進行創作。其中一件作品是由3D掃 描現實自然環境的數位模型，與透過電腦製作的3D模型搭建的虛擬場景，空間中出現的聲音，正是 都蘭部落老人家，透過他們的母語，闡述都蘭山的故事，而另一位女性的聲音為都蘭部落的女性， 她正翻譯老人家又中的傳說。創作者企圖降低傳說用來傳遞內容的功能性，而轉化成有關人類記憶 歷史的聲音。\n\nPeople live between mountains, and mountains cling to mountains.\n\nDuring the years when the artist lived in eastern Taiwan, she has heard different narrations of Dulan Mountain, whether in terms of its culture, spirituality, or belief. She unconsciously began to be curious about Dulan Mountain and started to develop the work Being or Between. In this work, the artist analyzes, explores, experiences, and feels this mountain from all aspects, which inspired her to contemplate the stories, concepts, and imaginations created based on the relationships between people and mountains. The artist looks to Iind out the state of mind hidden behind these narrations.\n\nThere are many mountains surrounding the Taitung area, such as the Central Mountain Range, Mt. Sige, and Mt. Luan. Among them, the Mt. Dulan has been regarded, by indigenous people, as a rather important mountain, and can also be recognized as a birthplace of migrating route onto the Puyuma Tribe who dwells in the southwest of the Mt. Dulan, and to the Doulan Tribe who lives in the east side, the Mt. Dulan is deemed as the mountain god.\n\nTo the people who lived in thousands of years ago, the Mt. Dulan was likely having some correlation with them. Through several investigations, rescues, and excavations since 1945, the Beinan Archaeological Site has been unearthed with many objects left by prehistoric mankind in Taiwan, by which, these remnants could specify that the Beinan Archaeological Site used to be a large-scale, prehistoric colony rarely seen in Taiwan. This site has unearthed thousands of people from thousands of years ago. They were each laid on slabs of stone pieced together to form a long space. They all lay in the same direction along the north-east/south-west axis. The feet of the dead point towards north-east. So when they sit up, they face Mount Dulan.\n\nIn 2003, the Beinan Archaeological Site and the Mt. Dulan in Taiwan were elected as a potential site to apply for the title of world heritage, the reason of which is, the Mt. Dulan could be the sacred mountain onto the prehistoric tribes. Hence, the Beinan Archaeological Site and the Mt. Dulan shall be subsumed as the reservation area for further investigation and research. The critical legend about the Mt. Dulan being deemed as the prehistoric tribes’ sacred mountain is verified because all of the deceased are buried and facing to the Mt. Dulan; nevertheless, is it the moderns’ interpretation or a prehistoric fact? There are still remaining lots of details to be explored and sorted out. This work is mainly to explore the logic and context behind the thesis of “the Beinan Archaeological Site and the Mt. Dulan”.\n\nTo create this work, the artist resides at and lives in the job site to communicate with the local aboriginals, climb the Mt. Dulan many a time, and use the 3D scan, acoustics, and digital image to depict the interaction of body and mountain and the communication of human beings as an important element of the work. One of his works is the digital mold, which is using 3D technique to scan the realistic nature environment and using 3-D mold to create the virtual scenes through the computer production; the voice coming from the space (a hollow part) is the Doulan tribe’s greybeard telling a story of the Mt. Dulan through his mother tongue, and the other voice is the tribe’s female translating the greybeard’s story. The creator intends to decrease the legend to pass down the content capabilities and transform into the historic voice in regard to the human memory.\n\nI believe everyone should have the opportunity to advance in their career by accessing new methods outside the traditional academic path. Creative approaches for learning and disseminating educational material should be the new way of presenting archives through multi-media collaborations using art and immersive presentations. The moving image theoretical construction and education can assist to understand better the reasons for creating artwork while fostering a voice for those who have found it difficult to express themselves.\n\nDuring the pandemic, libraries and galleries were shut down prohibiting access to their archives and exhibitions. The shift in producing digital archives for sharing information has become a new way to reimagine spaces to provide people with resources. Transitioning physical materials into digital files invited people to continue to be connected with important information and events around the world and presented the state of the human experience virtually. Using traditional art-making methods including the digitizing of archives is currently being experienced through devices with a combination of photography, video, and digital design. Using virtual platforms as an opportunity to support other students, faculty, and the public at large.\n\nDeveloping an inner voice that aided me in participating in the social framework has led me to responses that inspire change and defend my stance as a queer person navigating attitudes that are difficult to combat. Through building community and creating art, my practice has fostered new inquiry and transformed me into a better individual. Bringing difficult or frustrating topics into conversation narrows down parts of the human experience worth sharing. My goal is to highlight these memories and beautify them in ways that only traditional image-making coupled with the moving image can curate.\n\nI seek to utilize these traumatic and inspiring moments of my life to become the primary narrator in my body of work. In my personal history, the love for transcending thought into action and visible forms of art shifted a positive way of thinking that may be useful for others to view and learn from. Replaying memories from my past encourages me to find ways to extract those vital pieces of information and stitch together a story for others to use as their survival guide.\n\nMODERNO MINDSCAPES is about my personal memories and artistic process currently at its experimental stage––a Future Stage, one that will be discovered in my next academic pursuit.\n\nMusk4Mars is an online exhibition hosted in New Art City Festival 2022. Curated by Kawaii Agency, the show compiles brand new work from 11 artists, architects, researchers and layabout daydreamers.\n\nSet in the near future, the show imagines a Mars settlement established by Elon Musk. Viewers will experience Musk’s legacy project through the eyes of the billionaire’s son, visiting his father on the red planet for the first time. He is guided through the space by Nasubi - an ex-reality TV star now an NPC residing in the settlement. Musk4Mars was created collaboratively during weekly meetings, and reflects on themes such as accelerationist post-capitalism, techno-utopianism, nostalgia, colonialism, ethics and the thin line between utopian and dystopian thinking. The construction of this immersive exhibition space draws from found rendered objects and artworks created from projects sprouting from the cautiously utopian imperative to speculate a post-capitalist Martian settlement. It also references New Babylon, an architectural project that imagines a potential anti-capitalist city built on ludic sentiments and rhizomatic networks of linked platforms. In our reinterpretation, massive repurposed rock sculptures (by Anna Komitska) replace Constant’s smooth and functional surfaces, connected together by chrome silver stepladders, floating in space in spite of the weak gravity on Mars. Powered, financed and enabled by Musk’s reckless accelerationist principles, the ludic imagination here strives to interrogate itself of its complicity, while attempting to chart new potentials forward.\n\nSome of the main talking points discussed during our meetings include nostalgia for the mother planet, the impossible ethics of reverse-colonisation and post-scarcity lifestyle. Nostalgia and the archive is explored in Anna Komitska’s project Time Capsules, a collection of minerals naturally occurring on planet Earth that becomes gigantic sculptures, the indexical archive of humanity’s history as inextricably tied to Earth. While the scarcity of artificially synthesised oxygen implies that the use of fire must be kept to a minimum, the once indispensable driving force of humanity known as Fire is archived for future generations by Maite de Orbe in their video piece Till Fire Do Us Part. Through archival footage, they examine the varied intensities of Fire and forebode its poetic absence. Familiar relics and textures from the mother planet were algorithmically synthesised in Patrycja Dylag and Ola Sobczyk’s project Agora Peractorum. An imposing monument in the colony, it was created to soothe homesickness and immortalise the dialogic spirit of the communal. The domestic is also explored in Amy Ken Chen’s project Prayers at Dinner, a majestic dining space devoted to her ideal idol of domesticity.\n\nThomas Burke’s audio piece Mars Test 1 imagines the future of radio-hopping; patching together snippets of familiar pop songs, the project nevertheless points out the difference in sound perception on Mars, and serves as chief sonic ambience for the post-scarcity era. After all, one would need some pumping tunes to keep one’s muscles from shrinking in such a low gravity environment - this is where Livia Ribichini’s workout tutorial entitled Exercises Without Gravity proves useful. And yet, exercise is not the only activity considered vital in the colony - failure to keep Martian soil fertile would mean dire consequences for the settlers. As a reminder, Kayla Lui’s The Sanctuary adorns the space, impelling residents to contribute their life-giving urine. Peace and soil fertilisation are enforced by Alice Bajaj’s Robotters. An unfortunate inheritance from the mother planet, law enforcement could at least pretend to be adorable in these less-trying times. A good question remains however: to what extent must freedom be policed, even in post-capitalist Utopia where jealousy and competition counts for nought? All these ideas are introduced within the space by Bart Seng Wen Long and Juliusz Grabianski’s fictional character, Nasubi, master story-teller of gen-Z ilk and chief mascot of a brave new age on Mars.\n\nSilicon Valet is pleased to announce believe in us but not too much, a solo show of work by New Mexico-based artist Adrian Pijoan opening online on March 17th. Consisting of an immersive, virtual environment hosted by New Art City, and accompanied by a series of limited edition 3D and still image artworks sold as NFTs via the Hic et Nunc v2 smart contract, believe in us but not too much both expands upon and chronicles the artist’s forensic analysis and participation in online paranormal phenomenon communities.\n\nFor more than a decade, Pijoan has been an active member and devout student of various paranormal fora–particularly those dedicated to extraterrestrial activity and related government conspiracy theories. Over the years, he has accumulated an extensive collection of digital ephemera related to the history of documented alien activity around the world. The result is an esoteric and little known chronology that spans the better half of the last century; an ephemeral record culled from cult blogs, online bulletin boards, and niche social media fan communities. For believe in us but not too much, Pijoan reflects upon his research journey and presents an interactive 3D archive that creates a fantasy chronicle of this history as a virtual landscape.\n\nOver the course of his life, Pijoan has had a number of personal encounters with the paranormal; phenomena that have strengthened the artist’s interest in the relationship between perception and reality. His research efforts, and the artworks and environments that result, materialize in believe in us but not too much as an externalized interior landscape of the self–both affected by and affecting his own understandings of those experiences. Throughout history, folklore has helped people to make sense of and exist in the world: creating alternate realities that allow people to cope with the unknown or unrecognizable. In the context of a contemporary era of hyperreality, where perception is reality and feeling trumps logic, objectiveness loses meaning and what is left behind is what we feel to be true. While pushing at the sharp edge of the role of belief in society, Believe in us but not too much also urges us not to lose our capacity for fantasy in the midst of an, at times, protocol-driven society.\n\nThis exhibition represents Silicon Valet’s first solo presentation of an artist with digital editions available for sale. All works will be sold via the artist’s own Hic et Nunc page, with all proceeds going directly to them. Silicon Valet hopes that this curatorial endeavour in the cryptocurrency ecosystem will serve as a replicable model for value creation through curatorial labor, contextualization, and care.\n\nHello! This is the digital companion exhibition to accompany the FREAKOPHONE WORLD Release Reading on 2/18/2022, co-sponsored by Small Press Traffic, the Place for Writers, and the Mills College Creative Writing Program.

In 2016, he founded the Center for Afrofuturist Studies, an artist residency program for artists of color, based at Iowa City’s artist-run organization Public Space One.\n\nOrbiting the Glitch began as an idea in an era of instability and fragility. In this chaos, the path of failure sometimes appears as the only visible one.\n\nAs Samuel Beckett said, “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”\n\nThe exhibition is inspired by what it means to be an error and by what it means to embrace an error. With the curiosity about how this can be liberating and how it can inform and create new artistic practices, we join forces with the glitch.cool collective to produce an exhibition that explores the glitch aesthetic through music, visual, interactive and generative new media art.\n\nOrbiting the Glitch aims to showcase the work of the collective and how they have evolved over time. The collective is built on and expanded by community-shared knowledge and skills. The glitch.cool discord server has become a hub of audio-visual creatives and for that reason the exhibition aims to acknowledge those members by inviting them to participate with their work.\n\nTaking a step further; after publishing an open call and inviting artists, we discovered collaboration around the word which expands our community and introduces creatives who embrace the error in different ways.\n\nThe exhibition consists of the work of forty two artists who orbit the glitch through a variety of mediums and reasons. All of them contribute to the discussion of how technology and art intersect. Where can we find the errors in that intersection and how can we use them to either understand burgeoning fields of technology or simply enjoy the creative process and result?\n\nConsider what failure means and what people believe it means. There are disruptions to what we think of as normal. These disruptions lead to various places. They leave room for reconsidering and critically engaging with channels of communication, interaction, and perception. Sound disruption, lost signals, half finished sentences, looking for the line to come back. All of these glitches have the potential to cause anger and discomfort. But what if we accept them? Isn’t this accepting a new reality where everything is broken?\n\nWe accept these errors. These errors have the power to create new possibilities.\n\nMuch of the spirit of this exhibition is based on Legacy Russell’s Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto.\n\nThis pavilion is one of many in this year's The Wrong Biennale. As the curator, I invite you to check the link https://thewrong.org/ to explore the many other pavilions online as well as embassies, which include live exhibition spaces. I am very grateful to the biennale organizers as well as to the New Art City organizers for providing this opportunity for myself and the other artists to share our work. The works here may be experienced as if one is a phantom viewing the objects from the outside as well as passing through their walls to interior spaces, which include video, image, and sound, surrounding and enveloping the viewer who crosses over to the mysterious inside of the cubes and spheres.\n\nAnne Murray is an artist, writer, and also the curator of this exhibition. Her work explores human and other, language and absence, identifying new pathways to connect, while imagining herself as both an octopus and a stone. This research manifests in various media including poetry, video, installation, performance, photography, social practice, and art criticism. Educated with a BFA from Parsons School of Design in Paris, MFA and MS in Art History from Pratt Institute in New York, and M.Ed. from The College of New Jersey Global Studies Program, Mallorca, she now lives in Budapest.

It has resulted in interconnected bodies of research and curation, that bring together diverse voices, modes of expression, and interfaces for dialogue (physical & virtual). The focus areas of her research extend to projects with arts education, printmaking history and practice, the documentation of living traditions and folk arts in India, and environmental consciousness in the arts. Her current practice foregrounds sustained engagement with material culture and social history, seen through acts of community interaction, documentation and display; archiving and interpretation. She continues to explore her training in the arts through participation in multidisciplinary arts projects and experimenting with drawing and photography.\n\nShe is heading the Sunaparanta Arts Initiator Lab, Goa (S.A.I.L) in 2021-22 initiated and ran the Piramal Residency Artist Incubator Programme 2019-20. Lina is Associate Curator with ARTPORT_making waves and runs the Goa Familia archival photography project with Serendipity Arts Foundation. She concluded an Archival Museum Fellowship through India Foundation for the Arts for Goa Chitra Museum (2018-19).

My vision for life has been enriched thanks to multiple exhibitions, residencies, experimental workshops and encounters. Each of my works carries with it a large part of my story. These fragmented, deconstructed and then reconstituted bodies are the sum of all the materials that make us up. I use in my installations the magma of our existence, mixed with clay, water and air, giving my subjects a transcendent momentum. My latest productions are a response to all our fears, apprehensions and fears following narcissistic wounds that alter our body image. It is my way of exorcising slices of life, detaching myself from matter and broadening the spectrum of my knowledge of Man. My studies at the School of Fine Arts allow me to know the artist, his aspirations and his needs. My administrative function at the AARC Agency gives me easy access to this world of the arts that I encounter every day and allows me to discover artists from all walks of life and produce them, this enriches me and broadens my knowledge of arts and artists.\n\nNotes for the future monument, 2021 brings together practitioners working on the LCC UAL Photography program.\n\nThe exhibition is split into four thematic spaces; the room titles relating to urgencies identified through theoretical and practical concerns of student work. ‘Notes for the future monument’ is accompanied by a substantial theoretical text –a copy of which is available for you to download from this room. Within the pages you can read sixteen long form essays produced during the program which also act to expand upon themes and concerns dealt with through practice.\n\nWhat is remarkable about these texts and the visual work produced in the exhibition is not solely that it was created in the midst of a global pandemic. It is rather because practitioners in the show not only point towards current states of emergency, but offer new understandings, positions and hope toward urgent global and local issues.\n\nThe room entitled, Picturing New Practices, is filled with student voices. In this space you can listen to how work is conceived, produced and conceptualised. Foregrounded in this space is the passion and playfulness with which ideas are engaged with - whatever the specificity of the concern.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nCuration of the show was facilitated by guest practitioners Tom Milnes, Anna Nazo, Krasimira Butseva and Max Colson.

Natural disasters, the disappearance of seasons, and the climate crisis have evoked many discourses surrounding life and animals, and repeated creation and conflicts. Environment groups have emerged, and the controversial concept - animal rights emerged. However, in today's society, which is deeply intertwined with capital and science, such movement is too weak, so development and destruction are accelerating towards socio Entropy.\n\nWhat attempts can we make to disassemble deeply intertwined and firmly entrenched mechanical capitalism in society? We can find something for this in the text «L'animal que donc je suis (à suivre)» published by Derrida.\n\nDerrida rethinks the whole meaning of suffer for animal others through philosophical deconstruction, and suggests reviewing the whole recognition system through problems of suffering common to humans and animals instead of language, the framework of human intellect. He evoked the absolute passivity of suffering, and summoned the fundamental feelings of compassion not only for animals but also for life as a whole, including humans. And what we're given in the end would be a question of the relationship between animals and humans.\n\nThis exhibition re-translates the paradigm of animals, which has been defined in human language, adopting by Derrida's suggestion. Starting in this point, we might be able to find a clue to genuine coexistence, not only for human beings. We review the relationships within the neoliberal worldview where humans and animals are mixed, examine how they existed, destroy the paradigm, and reconnect animals and me through visual experience.\n\nFirst, in section , we re-construct animals presence and their connection with surroundings in their natural states. Focusing on animals as creatures living finite lives, we examine the interrelationships of the numerous societies and actors surrounding them.\n\nNext, section deconstruct the fauna connected with people as the object of affection. With the recent sharp expand in the pet industry, high knowledge and obligations of animals as caregivers or protectors tend to be required. On the other hand, we look at the newly emerging animal fauna called “Companion animals”.\n\nIn the last section , we will examine the images of symbolic animals that have become separate from their natural context and take new characters. Animals have been positioned as divine beings, or abstract symbols since humankind society was built. The deified animal has been separated from its intrinsic position, get immortal life, and has been misunderstood or worshiped. We will figure out how these aspects of animals relate to human culture and also how these things are affecting real animals.\n\n«i Kiss: Greet Your Great Friends» imagines these heterogeneous networks of animals-human beings with eight artists who show outstanding insight about animals and explores the possibility of new - sustainable - relationships and coexistence of the world that will arrive. Through various media and themes such as painting, digital painting, video, sound, and branding design, we deconstruct the connection between humans and animals and expect to shift the perception structure."
