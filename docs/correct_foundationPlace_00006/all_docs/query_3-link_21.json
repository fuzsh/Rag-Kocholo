        "text": "Founded in 1970 by Robert Kelley (Artistic Directer Emertius), TheatreWorks has grown from a truly original Silicon Valley start-up to become the peninsula’s leading professional nonprofit theatre company. In 2019, TheatreWorks was honored to receive the Regional Theatre Tony Award.\n\nNow under the leadership of Artistic Director Giovanna Sardelli and Interium Executive Director Criss Henderson, TheatreWorks presents a wide variety of contemporary plays and musicals, as well as revitalizing great works of the past. We are champions of new work, offering artists support and a creative home as they develop exciting new stories for the American theatre. Offstage, arts education programs in our schools and arts engagement programs in our neighborhoods uplift our audiences and strengthen community bonds."
