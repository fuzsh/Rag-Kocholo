        "text": "Factum Arte uses a variety of techniques to make artworks. Some are drawn from the latest developments in manufacturing technology, while others are not even used in industry yet. They range from casting to advanced milling and include several types of 3D printing. While some of these technologies are used by contemporary artists to make objects, others are more often in use for re-materialising existing or lost art.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example is using 3D printing to make objects that most people might consider to be not three-dimensional at all: paintings. The texture of the surface on which the original artist painted can have an influence on the composition: knots and grain in wood panels could direct the artist on how to place elements of the picture. Some artists’ techniques create characteristic 3D texture to their works: both Rembrandt and Van Gogh used very thick paint that they almost sculpted onto their canvases; a technique known as impasto. Almost every artist creates texture with their brushstrokes, which are an integral part of the viewer’s experience of looking at a painting.\n\nFactum uses elevated printing to make the textured surface for a re-materialised painting. Similar to flatbed printing, which the company uses in an advanced form to print colour onto surfaces, elevated printing uses an UV-cured polymer ink to build up a textured surface layer upon layer. Each layer is between 10 μm and 15 μm thick and reproduces the depth map recorded using a Lucida scanner (sometimes manipulated digitally) in a physical form.\n\nIn general, the print from the elevated printer is not itself used as the substrate for a final re-materialised image but is used to make a silicon mould from which a substrate is cast in a material more suitable for the finished work. Gesso – a binder mixed with powdered chalk or gypsum – is often used, as artists have used it for centuries to prepare the surfaces of materials for painting.\n\nThe white textured surface thus created is then printed in colour using a modified flatbed Epson Stylus Pro 1180 printer. The modification allows the operator to overprint very precisely many times using inks of varying opacity. Before printing, Factum’s technicians use Photoshop to split the image file into several layers to extract as much information as possible about the different tones present. The deepest layer contains information about the darkest tones and subsequent layers capture lighter tones. Varying the opacity of the ink allows detail that might otherwise be lost in the darkest areas of the picture to be retained. The darkest areas are overprinted the most times to produce a very wide range of dark tones: this can be very effective when printing an image by an artist for whom dark colours are particularly important, such as Joshua Reynolds who often painted his subjects in rich dark clothing.\n\nAnother benefit of overprinting in this way is that it is very well suited to working on textured surfaces with micron level detail. To ensure that the ink lands on precisely the right position on the surface, a version of the Lucida texture map is first printed onto a clear acetate sheet, which is used to register the printer – that is, to position the printing head to a high precision – before replacing the clear sheet with the textured relief surface.\n\nIn some cases, rather than 3D-printing a textured substrate, the surface to be printed is made by routing; this is particularly useful when the relief depth is near or beyond the upper limit of what is achievable using elevated printing. Factum uses industrial routing machines controlled by a combination of commercial and in-house developed software. This technique was used to make replicas of the mediaeval Mappa Mundi, owned by Hereford Cathedral: the original map was drawn onto a single sheet of calf-skin vellum, which has, over seven centuries, warped and buckled. Incredibly precious, the original map is displayed behind glass that is only removed every other year. One facsimile was routed from plaster and left unprinted so that blind and partially sighted people can feel it to get an impression of the map’s appearance. Another version was colour printed to give a more accessible version of the map in its current state of preservation for study by conservators, researchers and the general public. Routing techniques are also used by some of Factum’s contemporary art clients, notably Marina Abramović, who makes objects routed from alabaster.\n\nOne of the most ambitious projects at Factum Foundation is its collaboration with Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio, to develop ways to use Factum’s digital recording techniques to determine a painting’s attribution. The study aims to teach artificial intelligence systems to recognise the distinctive way that artists form brushstrokes on canvas, similar to handwriting recognition. This could not only give a valuable new way for the art world to determine whether a picture is genuine or a copy, but could even determine which members of an artist’s workshop contributed to a finished work and which parts were painted by whom.\n\nInitially, the goal of the project is to study late works by El Greco, the Crete-born artist best known for his work in 16th-century Spain. He established a workshop in Toledo where he took on students, including his son Jorge Manuel, who worked with him as assistants. El Greco often painted only the portions of his large artworks that he considered most important himself and entrusted his students to reproduce his high idiosyncratic style in the other parts of the pictures; a common practice for artists of that and other periods. It is partly for this reason that El Greco’s work is often the subject of debates about attribution.\n\nA team from CWRU’s department of physics, materials science and engineering developed the system. Using several paintings of lilies by students from Cleveland Institute of Art, four artists created three virtual ‘patches’ to areas of the paintings to simulate how assistants might have worked on them. The analysis focused on the subtle detail that can be thought of as the dynamic movements of the bristles as they respond to each hand. In reality, the analysis is numerical and is looking at the paintings in different ways. After training the system on the ‘patches’ produced by each artist, the system successfully identified 98% of them, connecting them to other samples made by the same hand."
