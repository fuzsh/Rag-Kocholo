        "text": "SJSU 2024 MFA Exhibition: Disruption Invites Reconciliation\n\nThe Liftoff exhibition & accompanying catalogue showcases work by nine artists, all MFA graduates of San José State University, presenting a reciprocity of vision and energy catalyzed by the artists' engagement in the program. As the artists have worked to describe their own work, they acknowledge a distinctive push-and-pull informing their process—abstraction/figuration, process/product, personal/political, mystery/knowing, chance/control, constraints/expanse. At the same time, they have identified an intention to reconcile these polarities through the forces of harmony and unity.\n\nOn view May 31 - June 21, 2024 at San José Works\n\nShannon Wright was in the DeYoung Open, and is slowly building the installation version of the piece.\n\nShannon Wright made this digital drawing, \"Salon Après Tetris (5 Seconds of Fame)\" specifically in response to the deYoung Open call for entries. She built the scene (minus the figure) in Rhinoceros and painstakingly redrew all the parts and the person in Adobe Illustrator. The piece is a vector drawing of an installation piece that she has been building on her sabbatical in addition to another project. The installation was accepted into Untitled Miami Beach but she had to change the plan because it's going to take a while to build all 25 tetris frames. She worked on numerous other projects on my sabbatical also.\n\nClick here for more details"
