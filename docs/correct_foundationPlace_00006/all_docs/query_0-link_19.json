        "text": "Milhazes is considered as one of the most important Brazilian artists, having participated at Carnegie International, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (1995); Sydney Biennial, Sydney (1998); Venice Biennale (2003); São Paulo Biennial (1998, 2004); and Shangai Biennial, Shangai (2006).\n\nHer work is included in important museums and public collections such as Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; MoMA – The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate Modern, London; SFMoMA – San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; MNBA – Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, Rio de Janeiro; Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo; Instituto Itaú Cultural, São Paulo; Fundação Edson Queiroz, Fortaleza; Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo Art Museum, Tokyo; 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; Fondation Beyeler, Basel; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.\n\nBeatriz Milhazes's practice includes painting, drawing and collage. Characterized by vibrant colours, optical movement and energetic visual cadences, her abstract work fuses a diverse repertoire of images and forms, combining elements from her native Brazilian context with European abstraction.\n\nMilhazes is represented by Pace Gallery, New York; Galeria Fortes D’Aloia e Gabriel, Sao Paulo; Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin; and White Cube, London.\n\nShe lives and works in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nExamples include Direction, a series of paintings produced using gravity, Force, an installation in which silicone oil pours down through space, Biomatrix, an installation of bubbles emerging in on a liquid surface in a grid pattern, and Foam, in which bubbles form enormous cloud-like volumes in space.\n\nRecently, Nawa has also worked on architectural projects, including the art pavilion Kohtei. VESSEL, a performance work produced in conjunction with Belgo-French choreographer and dancer Damian Jalet, has been presented around the world since its premiere in 2015. In 2018, his sculpture Throne was exhibited under the Pyramid at the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France. As a monumental work to be installed near La Seine Musicale at the lower end of the Ile Seguin in Boulogne-Billancourt, Ether (Equality) will be permanently installed and officially unveiled in early summer 2023.\n\nRecent major shows include “Generative Interface,” Towada Art Center, Aomori, Japan (2022), “TORNSCAPE” SCAI THE BATHHOUSE, Tokyo (2021), “Foam,” 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan (2019), “The Life of Animals in Japanese Art,” The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., USA (2019), “PixCell,” Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, France (2018) and “Throne,” Musée du Louvre, Paris (2018).\n\nhighlighting the complexities of multicultural identity. Tan’s work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, including the Tate Modern in London, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, and the Venice Biennale.\n\nIn the 2000s, Tan's work shifted towards more ambitious installations that combined video, sound, and photography. Her acclaimed work \"Disorient\" (2009) was a multi-screen video installation conceived specially for the presentation in the Dutch Pavilion at the Venice Biennale and points to the strategic geopolitical position held by Venice in the distant past, raising critical questions about contemporary globalism and its origins.\n\nTan's installations often create immersive environments that invite the viewer to reflect on their own experiences of memory and identity. Her work “Ascent” (2016) is a film composed of almost 4,000 still images depicting one of Japan’s most recognizable landmarks, Mount Fuji. The photographs used in the film were brought together from the collection of the Izu Photo Museum, which collaborated on the film, and images uploaded by the public through a website launched for the project.\n\nIn addition to her artistic practice, Tan is also a respected educator and writer. She has taught at a number of institutions, including the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam and the University of California, Berkeley. Her essays on art and culture have been published in a range of academic and popular publications.\n\nHomma's work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, including the Tate Modern in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the National Museum of Art in Osaka. He has also published several books, including \"Tokyo and My Daughter,\" a personal exploration of fatherhood and the city that has shaped his life. He has also authored, \"Fun Photography: A Photography Classroom for Good Children\" and recent collections of his work include \"Symphony mushrooms from the forest\" (Case Publishing) and \"Looking Through Le Corbusier Windows\" (Walther König, CCA, Window Research Institute).\n\nOne of Homma's most celebrated series is \"New Waves 2000-2013\" which features photographs of the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii spanning 13 years. Revisiting the same landscape repeatedly, Homma captures photographs of the coastline continuously un-changed by climate or seasonal time, reflecting on the interaction between pictorial and mental space. Homma's work has earned him numerous accolades over the years, including the 24th Kimura Ihei Photography Award in 1999 for his photo book \"Tokyo Suburbia\" (Korinsha Publishing Co., Ltd.) and the Photographic Society of Japan Award. He continues to be an influential figure in the world of photography, both in Japan and internationally."
