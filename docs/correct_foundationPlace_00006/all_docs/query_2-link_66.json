In 2009 we received ISO9001 certification and have implemented stringent quality management processes as the foundation for sustainable development and business growth.\n\nEnvironmental Responsibility\n\nDid you know that Taiwan has one of the highest recycling rates in the world? Following this progressive example, we take environmentally responsible manufacturing, distribution and disposal processes very seriously. We fully comply with RoHS and are committed to meet requirements of REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive), GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), Green Dot, Hazard Assessment of PFOS (Perfluorooctane Sulfonate) as well as those for Halogen-free products. We are also ISO14001 certified, a standard that provides a framework for environmental management systems."
