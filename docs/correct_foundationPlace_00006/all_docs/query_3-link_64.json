That’s why Silicon Quantum Computing launched in May 2017 and now has over A$150 million of capital funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government, UNSW Sydney, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Telstra Corporation and the State Government of New South Wales.\n\nSQC’s foundation intellectual property was developed at the Australian Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communications Technology (CQC2T). Led by a team of brilliant thinkers, including 2018 Australian of the Year Michelle Simmons AO and colleagues produced many ‘World firsts’.\n\nOur People\n\nPowered by Passion\n\nEven at the cutting-edge, technology depends upon a network of collective minds; each focused on solving individual challenges to achieve a shared vision. Put simply, it relies on people power brought to life through inspiring leadership.\n\nLed by Michelle Simmons, SQC’s unique collaborative and competitive spirit is driven by a relentlessly curious mindset that questions convention and strives for brilliance. Yet there is no secret to this formula – it simply comes down to dedication, passion and hard work."
