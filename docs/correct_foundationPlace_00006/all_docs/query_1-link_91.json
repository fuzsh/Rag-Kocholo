Selleck\n\nAriel B. Lee\n\nSound Editing and Recording: Gilbert Leung\n\nMusic: Jonathan M. C. Jordan\n\nRecording At: Alameda County District Attorney Office\n\nThe Walt Disney Company consists of much more than just “The Happiest Place on Earth,” and Marjorie Randolph’s 15 years there revolved around Walt Disney Studios, where she was senior vice president of human resources and administration. That’s a lot\n\nof happiness to manage: live action and animated movies (including much-loved Pixar and Miramax films), music associated with the movies, the home entertainment division, and live stage shows like Disney on Ice. Prior to her work at Disney, Randolph,\n\nwho is now retired, served as senior vice president and general counsel of the department store chain Mervyn’s.\n\nJust like Disneyland on a hot day with long lines and tired children, human resources work isn’t always all smiles. But Randolph knows\n\nthe value of one, even when the job gets tough. “During intense legal negotiations, I realized how important it is to read a room, understand how critically important nonverbal communication is, and understand how humor can help bridge an adversarial\n\nsituation,” she explains.\n\nhttps://www.cla.purdue.edu/alumni/OurAlumni/Profiles/Randolph._Marjorie.html\n\nLISTEN HERE: Volume 3 Marge Randolph\n\nWith Hosts:\n\nSummer C.
