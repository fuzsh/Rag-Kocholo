        "text": "SVCF’s Community Action Grants Program was established in response to recommendations from our community partners. Using a racial justice and equity lens, the Community Action Grants Program identifies and supports organizations across issue areas that foster creativity and help build the community’s power to promote an equitable, economically secure and vibrant Silicon Valley.\n\nSVCF awards grants under the Community Action Grants program through an open Request for Proposals (RFP).\n\nFor 2024, SVCF is simplifying the application process for eligible nonprofit organizations. In recent years, we asked organizations to apply to RFPs for specific focus areas (for example health and environment), in some cases prompting organizations to apply multiple times each year.\n\nIn 2024, our process enables nonprofits to apply to multiple RFPs through one application, twice a year. The application encompasses a wide range of focus areas – so organizations only need to apply once to be considered for grants across issue areas. This change is in response to community feedback and is designed to recognize the important intersectional work of nonprofits in the region.\n\nWe will also accept applications for our Capacity-Building and Leadership Investment Program grants using this same application. Applications for the Capacity-Building and Leadership Investment Program will only be accepted during our Round 1 RFP of the year, in March.\n\nPlease see below for eligibility requirements and schedule.\n\nThis application is open to organizations engaged in the following focus areas:\n\nArts and Culture\n\nCapacity-Building and Leadership Investment*\n\nEnvironment\n\nFaith and Neighborhoods\n\nHealth\n\nLocal Journalism\n\nMovement- and Power-Building\n\n*Grants awarded during Round 1 only."
