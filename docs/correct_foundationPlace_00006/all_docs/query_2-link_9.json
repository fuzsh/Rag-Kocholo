I experience all perceptions in the act of painting\n\nas a dynamic process in which the discovery of the meaning of the world is affirmed not\n\nonly on the canvas but also in the relationship I establish with my subject and with myself.\n\nPainting is my favorite form of play, it is also a meditation and my way into consciousness.\n\nAs I paint, I notice that the image of my subject goes through an oscillating process of\n\nbeing and becoming. It is my goal when painting to connect with my feelings and evoke in\n\nthe viewer of the painting the same feelings, and the same desire to spontaneously create.\n\nIn developing a style of painting, I let my perceptions guide me through the cues I\n\nobtain from intuition and imagination and from the ever growing attunement of the\n\nmedium I use (oils).\n\nUltimately, I think that “style” is anyone’s particular way of seeing, of signifying and of\n\ngiving meaning.
