        "text": "Silicon Imaging, Inc., specializes in the design, manufacturing and marketing of high-definition digital cameras and image processing solutions for the medical, scientific instrumentation, machine vision, entertainment and surveillance markets. Silicon's focus has been to leverage the recent advancements in CMOS imagers, digital processors and gigabit connectivity interfaces to develop a new generation of high definition products, which can outperform traditional video camera and processing systems, at a lower cost. Silicon Imaging offers more than 100 years combined experience in the development of high-speed digital image processing hardware, machine vision inspection, biometrics, video transmission and recording components and systems.Â It is proud to have an extensive client list from Fortune 500, Semiconductor, University, Research, Military and Entertainment industry including:Â IBM, General Dynamics, Micron, Coherent, FLIR, JPL, Rockwell, MIT, Sarnoff, NASA, Raytheon, Dalsa, Corning, Elbit, and Eastman Kodak. Silicon Imaging is a privately held company based in Niskayuna, NY.\n\nThe company was founded in September 2000, with the mission to make high definition video imaging affordable. Since then, Silicon Imaging has developed its first commercial high definition product.Â The MegaCameraâ¢ is the worlds first 3.2 Million pixel all-digital CMOS micro-camera, capable of producing 30 frames per second, in a package, which fits in the palm of your hand.Â Over the past several years, Silicon Imaging has continued to be an innovator in high-speed and high-resolution imaging components.Â In 2003, expanded its offering to include a family of USB2.0 bus power peripherals, capable of capturing triggered image event or video sequences at over 40Mpixels/sec. In 2003, raised resolution bar by introducing 6.6 Megapixel cameralink and USB2.0 cameras.Â In 2005, Silicon Imaging added Gigabit Ethernet into its arsenal of connectivity solutions and launched the worlds smallest 1920x1080 60P/120i 12-bit High-Definition Camera.Â Our products are state-of-the-art, offering capability for semiconductor equipment manufacturers to inspect components with pin-point accuracy.Â\n\nWe at Silicon Imaging expect that next yearsâ most valuable applications havenât even been dreamed up yet.Â We invite visionaries with ideas for high-definition digital image capture, processing or communication to contact us."
