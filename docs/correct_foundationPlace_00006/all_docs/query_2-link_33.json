        "text": "Factum Foundation, in collaboration with ARCHiVe Online Academy, is inviting university students of architecture, archaeology, and heritage conservation to an online workshop on Photogrammetry in Heritage Documentation. This workshop is exclusively for universities in Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The aim of the workshop is to train students in the photogrammetric recording of heritage structures and the production of digital 3D models and CAD drawings.\n\nThe workshop will be conducted online and will run for one month, with theoretical classes held every Saturday. During the week, students are expected to carry out the recording work. All students from the participating countries will attend the online classes simultaneously.\n\nThe workshop will accommodate a maximum of 20 students, with 2 students per group. Registrations opened on 15th July 2024 and will close on 9th August 2024. The selected students for the workshop will be finalised on 16th August 2024. Selection will be based on a first-come, first-served basis and a statement of intent, which should be no more than 300 words (half a page). There is no fee for the workshop.\n\nStudents are required to submit the names of 2 participants per group by 23rd August 2024. Due to the variety of subjects these students study, they are free to select any object or building in their vicinity for recording.\n\nFor online registration, please visit this page.\n\nTo review the workshop’s summary, please click here.\n\nIn May 2024, alongside a visit to the National Museum by a delegation from the Igbo-Ukwu community, a team from Factum Foundation carried out a training programme for a group of young Igbo-Ukwu community members, using photogrammetry to 3D scan a select number of bronzes from the National Museum in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nFollowing attempts by the Igbo Ukwu community to request access to the originals from the National Museum in Lagos, which were rejected on account of security concerns, Factum Foundation London was connected to the Igbo-Ukwu community, Dr Pamela Smith, and Dr Kingsley Daraojimba by Julie Hudson, curator in the Africa department at the British Museum. During the training, some bronzes were recorded using photogrammetry techniques taught by Factum Foundation’s Imran Khan and Ferdinand Saumarez Smith.\n\nPending further funding, the 3D models created by Factum Foundation and the trainees will be 3D printed and cast in bronze using the ceramic shell centrifugal casting method; essential for an accurate rendering of the fine surface details. These will then be displayed in the Shaw Institute of Cultural Art (SICA).\n\nFor the exhibition ‘Kafka. Making of an Icon’ (May 30 – October 27, 2024), celebrating the 100th anniversary of Franz Kafka’s death, the Bodleian Libraries partnered with Factum Foundation to recreate a lost concept model of Ricardo Bofill’s building known as ‘Kafka’s Castle’. This iconic apartment complex, overlooking the Sitges bay in Sant Pere de Ribes, Spain, since 1968, pays homage to Kafka’s 1926 novel with its name. Since then, it has undergone a drastic colour change from its original bluish-purple.\n\nIn collaboration with the archivists at Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura (RBTA), Factum Foundation meticulously reconstructed Ricardo Bofill’s concept model. Characterised by the innovative use of aluminium rods, the original model was unfortunately lost over time. The recreation pays homage to Bofill’s architectural vision and intricate design process. Using the original architectural plans of the 90 modular unit apartments, the Factum team crafted and 3D printed in resin a 1:125 scale model of the original building.\n\nIt is with great sadness and deep admiration that we remember Manuel Franquelo, a genuine artist and someone who understood the nature of representation as a painter, photographer, engineer, poet and thinker. He was a key figure in the creation of Factum Arte in 2001. His contributions have been and will always be part of Factum’s identity. His interdisciplinary approach and visionary ideas will continue to inspire our work.\n\nManuel’s originality and brilliance are captured in this film made while he was developing the Lucida 3D Scanner. The data that has been recorded with this system and its elegant algorithms that drive the operating system, have transformed the understanding of the surface of paintings and are having a profound impact on heritage management. The Lucida really is a work of art as much as a recording system – it reflects the true meaning of ‘techne’.\n\nManolo represents everything that is great about Spain and Spanish art. Illusion fused with mimetic resonance, all the senses working together, respect for tradition and an anarchic love of disruption, directness and complexity.\n\nOur thoughts are with Manuel’s family and all those who were touched by him.\n\nWith gratitude and love from everyone at Factum Arte and Factum Foundation; we are committed to carrying on his legacy."
