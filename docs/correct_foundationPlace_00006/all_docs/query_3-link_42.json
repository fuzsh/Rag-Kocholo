        "text": "Weâre leading the transformation from silicon to silicon carbide (SiC) as we shape the future of semiconductor markets: the transition to electric vehicles, the evolution of renewable energy and energy storage, and the advancement of industrial applications. After more than 35 years of forging new technology adoption and transformation, our WolfspeedÂ® power semiconductors are leading the industry through unrivaled expertise and capacity. Whatâs next? We believe anything is possible through hard work, collaboration and a passion for innovation.\n\nOur values are a simple, yet powerful, reflection of who we are and how we act; they are in all that we say, do and achieve for our company. They reflect both our great history of disruptive innovation and set the tone for the exciting future ahead. We do amazing things in a human way. Our employees from around the world across every business function shared their thoughts about our values through focus groups, emails and conversations. As a result, weâve established principles that represent what we want the experience to be for our employees as well as the customers, partners and communities we serve.\n\nMore and more industries are leveraging the industry-leading performance of Wolfspeed silicon carbide as they develop next-generation applications and devices.\n\nWolfspeedâs founders were the first to successfully commercialize silicon carbide, and for more than 35 years have focused on designing and supplying the industryâs highest-performing silicon carbide materials and devices for high-power applications.\n\nWe have spent more than 35 years establishing a global brand known for innovation, financial strength and reliable materials sourcing, staffed by the most forward-looking thinkers and doers in any scientific enterprise. When we transitioned to the Wolfspeed name in 2021, we were poised to build on that foundation with a renewed enthusiasm for the future."
