        "text": "Biography & Works\n\nBorn in 1952 in Barcelona, Spain, Barba's work is characterized by his skillful manipulation of iconic historical artworks and his ability to reinterpret them in a contemporary context. He is also a multidisciplinary artist who works in media such as painting, photography, sculpture and video art.\n\nLluis Barba, The Gleaners by Jean François Millet, 2022, Photograph on Backlit Fabric, 60W x 38.75H X 4D In.\n\nMultidisciplinary artist Lluis Barba.\n\nBarba's artistic contribution to art involves creating intricate works where he merges famous masterpieces with celebrities, elements of popular culture and current events. By juxtaposing these different elements, he generates a visual dialogue about the past and the present, inviting viewers to reconsider traditional artistic narratives and engage with them in new and unexpected ways. His work is skillfully composed aimed to create a cohesive visual experience by him blending classical and contemporary elements that demonstrates a deep understanding of art history and a keen awareness of the cultural shifts occurring in the modern world.\n\nLluís Barba challenges conventional notions of art, time, and identity. His pieces provoke questions about our evolution, the impact of technology on artistic expression, and the fact that we have departed from spiritualty to a more materialistic world - like adoring Chanel or Louis Vuitton branding. Barba's work also explores themes of consumerism, globalization, and the changing nature of human interaction in the digital age.\n\nOver the years, Lluís Barba's work has garnered international recognition and has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. His artistic vision and innovative approach to combining the old with the new have earned him a place within the contemporary art scene, where he continues to captivate audiences and spark conversations about the dynamic relationship between art, time, and culture.\n\nLluis Barba, 1920 Hubert Robert The Old Temple, 2023, Photograph on Backlit Fabric, 23.62 x 28.74 x 2.36 in.\n\nWorks & Biography\n\nLluis Barba, Study of Jan Brueghel the Younger Kunstkammer with Venus 1/3, 2022, Diasec, 72W x 48.25H In.\n\nLluis Barba, Lady with a Ferret, Leonardo da Vinci, 1017 , Photograph on Backlit Fabric, 43 x 35.5 In.\n\n​A Contemporary Interpretation of The Prado Museum Masterpieces\n\nRenowned digital Photographer Lluis Barba offers us a fresh twist on The Prado Museum’s Spanish and Dutch Art from The Golden Age: The Early Nineteenth Century, with special emphasis on, Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Francisco de Goya, Hieronymus Bosch, and Pieter Brueghel. Barba is inspired by the 200-year-old Prado Museum given its position as a primary depository for Spanish art. This collection of Barba’s photographs focuses particularly on the artistic relationship the artists of the Spanish School maintained with foreign artists. Born in Barcelona, Spain, Lluís Barba is a multidisciplinary artist who works in such media as painting, photography, sculpture, and video art. His representational works include the series “Tourists in Art”, “Travelers in Time” and “Self-portraits,” characterized by his interpretation of the masterpieces of the past. The Museum, “Museo Nacional del Prado” opened to the public on November 19, 1819 as a Royal Museum of Painting and Sculpture. In 2019, the museum celebrated its Bicentennial with a commemoration that revealed its storied history from 1819 to current day.\n\nLluis Barba merges social criticism into contemporaryart.

In his contemporary works, he shows a reflection of society and a critique of the problems it generates.\n\nArtist Statement\n\n​Travellers in Time\n\nMy work is a reflection of society and a critique of the problems it generates. ‘Art is a privileged platform and those who we have access we have to tap…’ I single out the two speeds at which society progresses, the vertiginous imbalance in our world, opulence and poverty, culture and ignorance… and on the other hand I show the isolation, mass consumption, alienation and the daily loss of identity. I try to translate these concepts conceptually and formally.\n\nThe formal part of the fascination stems from the way our brain receives external afferents, since the image we receive through the retina becomes totally fragmented at the hypothalamus, where a virtual image is reconstructed conditioned by the evolutionary parameters from our species. Which leads me to contextualize elements of reality to place them in another, creating new realities.\n\nThe items I use are the result of the photographs captured with my camera, videos and other documentation. These are characters and icons turned into symbols to convey my message in an ironic way. These elements coexist in the works of art of the past, which I use as a support. My language emerges from this combination. Formally, I use black and white to represent the past and the colour to show our present.\n\nI usually create a relationship between characters of the cultural world, artists, curators, filmmakers, thinkers, religious, political, poor, marginalized, displaced, in contrast to those generated by the star system, as well as works of art, sculptures… I create stereotypes ranging from military uniforms with floral patterns wielding ice cream, instead of guns, in order to demystify the image associated with aggressiveness. I incorporate tattos of barcode, wich symbolizes the loss of individual identity, approval, alignment and mass consumption.\n\nRecovery of past masters, contemporary artists from different disciplines as Jeff Koons, Paul McCarthy, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Donald Judd, Sol-LeWitt, Cattelan, Miró, Matthew Barney, Richter, Rothko, Vanessa-Beecorft… and also works by artists of the past that are no longer in ‘the art guidebook’ and are almost forgotten, for me it is a contrast antagonistic. While the classics seek perfection from perfection, contemporaries seek perfection from imperfection. The classics define the work as artistic craftsmanship, and the contemporary mechanization and seriation socializes an important part of art.\n\nThe fact I criticize society dramas through plasticity and a nice way is not accidental ‘The more people see atrocities, more likely to raise awareness and stop the same’. The formal part and the complex conceptual part create contrasting microhabitats where past and present lose their effectiveness and become virtual time.\n\nI have a relationship of admiration with art history and I respect the old masters. I think it’s important to keep the roots and our historical memory. The contemporary art today has his foundations in the past masters, for example: Rembrandt and Caravaggio, chiaroscuro was so useful in photography and film. Leonardo structured the foundation of humanism and multidisciplinary art. Duchamp was a precursor, decoupling context of everyday objects and turning them into conceptual and artistic objects: Ready made. Mondrian worked with the structuring of a work, from the formal point of view with his theory of mass volume and colour."
