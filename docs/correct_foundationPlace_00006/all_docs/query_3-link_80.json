        "text": "Kimberlie Moutoux\n\nArtist Statement- Kimberlie Moutoux\n\nMy work lies at the intersection of art and nature, extracting and interpreting lines and curves drawn into the Earth. My body of work reflects a way of seeing these lines created in nature. My favorite vantage point for this exploration of the world is at a walking pace, interpreting the world as experienced from the multi-sense immersion of life lived at ground level one footstep at a time.\n\nMy work over the last 9 years moves in two directions, with the first involving studies of environmental issues regarding water. Wild and Free showcases the last river in California that has escaped the ecologically destructive practice of damming. My installation entitled \"Boinneartaic- Living in a State of Drought\" was created in 28 tapestries (each 14 in square) to represent the rainfall totals in 4 regions of the state of California over 7 years. (Boinneartiac means \"small isolated drop of rain\") My second focus is driven by my study of birds. One Hundred days for the Birds is a collage of the birds I discovered in my neighborhood during the first 100 days of shelter in place March to June 2020. My Art quilt \"World on the Wing\" focuses on the migratory paths of twelve pelagic bird species, many threaded by extinction.\n\nMy choice of medium has shifted over the course of my career. My educational training is in sculpture. I worked for 8 years creating in steel, bronze, wood, glass, and ceramics. As I became more sensitive to ecological issues, I moved to less energy intensive practices, creating in the realm of textiles, using natural dyes in most of my work. I also work in watercolor, quilted landscapes and photography. Before the shelter in place went into effect, I taught mural painting at local elementary schools for 3 ½ years."
