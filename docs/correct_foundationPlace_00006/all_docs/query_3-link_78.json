        "text": "Today, Tesla’s electric vehicle and battery prototypes are developed and assembled here in its engineering headquarters. Electric vehicle rival Rivian now resides in the buildings originally occupied by our first tenant - Varian Associates.\n\nWith over 150 companies in 10 million square feet and 140 buildings, Stanford Research Park maintains a world-class reputation. It has been our mission to capture the spirit and vision of Dean Terman by supporting the needs of our tenant companies so they can perpetuate the Park’s legacy of innovation and build a bold future."
