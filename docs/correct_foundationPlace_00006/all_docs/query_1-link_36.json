The proportional relationship of the individual sprayed surfaces to one another and to the overall format is based on a conceptual system that is reinforced by the mechanical transfer of paint using the spray gun as a tool, thus fundamentally calling into question the personalized, painterly gesture.⁠\n⁠\nHis new painting approach coincided with a time when conventional art practice was being radically transformed by Minimal Art. Venezia, together with fellow artists such as Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman, and Sol LeWitt, was searching for painterly possibilities beyond Abstract Expressionism–for this purpose, they abandoned traditional categories such as painting and sculpture and reduced the work of art to its elementary material and plastic aspects, such as material, color, and texture. The course of this new painting process and the resulting pictorial qualities repeatedly become an encounter with the unpredictable.⁠\n⁠\nInstallation view Michael Venezia \"Spray Paintings\", 29 June – 22 July 2023, max goelitz Munich.
