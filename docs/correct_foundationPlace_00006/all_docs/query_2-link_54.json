        "text": "Nepal Earthquake Relief\n\nIn April 2015, the devastating 7.8 magnitude Gorkha earthquake in Nepal killed more than 8,000 people, injured more than 21,000, and destroyed the homes and schools of hundreds of thousands more. In collaboration with The Mountain Fund, the QE Foundation is facilitating the development of the Mankhu Emergency Center, the first comprehensive shelter for disasters and emergency preparedness in Nepal.\n\nOnce complete, the center will offer a medical clinic and lab, a kitchen capable of feeding 150 people daily, a sleeping area for 150, restrooms, a tailoring center to produce clothing, solar and other backup power systems, 10,000 gallons of fresh water, a FM radio, and trained facilities management personnel. The Mankhu Emergency Center will provide future disaster relief, something that was severely lacking at the time of the quake.\n\nJapan Earthquake & Tsunami Relief\n\nIn March 2011, Japan had a devastating earthquake and tsunami, in which tens of thousands of people lost their lives. Entire towns disappeared. Through Quinn Emanuel’s Tokyo office and the QE Foundation, and in collaboration with All Hands and OGA for Aid, the firm donated funds to support victims and rebuilding efforts.\n\nThese efforts helped reconstruct and re-soil the town of Ofunato, clean and restore its homes, and build a park for children who were not allowed to play outside because of glass, chemicals, and oil in the soil and grass after the tsunami subsided. The town dedicated the park to Quinn Emanuel.\n\nThe firm also devoted itself to saving Koishihama, a 30-family fishing village that subsisted on scallop farming. Koishihama’s port was rendered unusable, forcing many families to leave without any source of subsistence. Quinn Emanuel helped rebuild the port and preserve the town.\n\nEcuador Earthquake Relief\n\nIn April 2016, Ecuador experienced its worst natural disaster in nearly seven decades—a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 600 people, injured more than 27,000, and left thousands homeless. Roads were badly damaged, bridges collapsed, power was disrupted, and soccer stadiums had to be used as makeshift relief centers and morgues. The Ecuadorean President declared a state of emergency.\n\nThe timing of the earthquake could not have been more devastating, as the country was already experiencing a significant economic downturn. In the aftermath, Quinn Emanuel raised significant funds to help Ecuadorian Red Cross aid workers distribute essentials, including food, water, mattresses, medicine, and other necessary supplies to survivors in need.\n\nSupporting Cerebral Palsy Alliance\n\nQuinn Emanuel’s Sydney office participates in “Steptember,” an annual charity event run by the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, which provides support services to thousands of people with cerebral palsy and other physical disabilities. The Alliance challenges participants to take 10,000 steps every day during the month of September.\n\nIn 2015, Steptember raised $3,992,438.65 in Australia and $5,307,030.41 worldwide to pay for equipment, therapy, and research into cerebral palsy treatments.\n\nHurricane Sandy Relief\n\nIn October 2012, the greater New York metropolitan area was struck by Hurricane Sandy. New York’s state government estimated that 305,000 housing units were damaged or destroyed, and the cost of those damages exceeded $70 billion.\n\nQuinn Emanuel’s New York office, in collaboration with a local relief organization, donated time and money to the relief efforts. Attorneys and staff volunteered to clean up the homes and community of hurricane victims in Far Rockaway, NY, and helped set up a collection center for people to donate essentials to the cause."
