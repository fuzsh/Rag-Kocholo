Social innovators tackle interconnected problems and advance solutions from every angleâ€”from disrupting unjust systems and movement building to improving policies and practices. We focus on problems and places that are ripe for change, with potential for major impact.\n\nWe partner with social entrepreneurs and other social innovators who have lived or learned experience in the challenges they are addressing. These organizations and leaders mobilize collective efforts to advance their vision and drive durable and lasting change."
