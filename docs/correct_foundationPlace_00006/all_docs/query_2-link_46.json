        "text": "Open letter from TheatreWorks' leadership, May 2020\n\nTo the TheatreWorks Family and Community,\n\nTheatreWorks has, since inception, had at its very core a belief in the shared humanity of all the world’s citizens from every race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and ability. The recent brutal murders of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and Ahmaud Arbery in Southern Georgia point to an ongoing disease, a virus, a pandemic of racism and discrimination that has plagued America for over 400 years.\n\nWe are devastated about the senseless violence that has broken the hearts and trust in justice of so many of our fellow citizens. As an arts organization we stand firm in our resolve to continue to tell the stories of those whose voices are too often silenced. We hope and believe that the theatre we produce and the resulting democratic dialogue we engender can be an essential component in our society’s ability to one day achieve justice and equality for all. We believe that Black Lives Matter and that we must as a nation work together to dismantle structural racism that dehumanizes and destroys the Black body.\n\nIn this moment of national anguish and profound unrest we have decided to temporarily suspend our online programming for a period of reflection and out of respect for the gravity of these concerns. The upcoming online reading of Pandora, by Laurel Ollstein, will be rescheduled at a time to be announced at a future date.\n\nWe are committed to making theatre that celebrates the human spirit and builds bridges between communities and individuals from diverse backgrounds. We recommit our theatre to seek ways to connect and engage more deeply with communities of color in and around the Bay Area. We stand in solidarity with our Black artists, staff members, board members, audiences, donors, and volunteers. We encourage you, our community, to seek ways you can contribute to making the world a more equitable place for us all. Below are some resources we would like to share.\n\nMay we all someday be able to equally celebrate the human spirit in harmony and peace.\n\nTim Bond, Artistic Director Designate\n\nRobert Kelley, Artistic Director\n\nPhil Santora, Executive Director\n\nORGANIZATIONS FOR DIRECT ACTION\n\nNational\n\nColor of Change\n\nhttps://colorofchange.org/\n\nAnti-Racist Research and Policy Center:\n\nhttps://antiracismcenter.com/\n\nBlack Lives Matter - What Matters 2020\n\nhttps://blacklivesmatter.com/what-matters-2020/\n\nIn the Bay Area\n\nSan Jose African American Community Service Agency:\n\nhttps://www.sjaacsa.org\n\nSan Jose/Silicon Valley NAACP:\n\nhttp://www.sanjosenaacp.org\n\nSilicon Valley Debug:\n\nhttps://www.siliconvalleydebug.org\n\nShowing Up for Racial Justice Bay Area Chapter:\n\nhttps://www.surjbayarea.org\n\nFURTHER RESOURCES\n\nLetters for Black Lives: For those of us who come from immigrant families, Letters for Black Lives offers explanations of the Black Lives Matter movement in dozens of languages, including Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and more.\n\nBlack Youth Project: Video on the differences between being \"non-racist\" and \"anti-racist.\"\n\nThe Okra Project: The Okra Project is a collective that seeks to address the global crisis faced by Black Trans people by bringing home-cooked, healthy, culturally-specific meals and resources to Black Trans people wherever they can reach them.\n\nAnti-Racism for Asian Americans: A three-pronged approach for Asian Americans who want to begin cultivating an anti-racist mindset.\n\nShifting the Culture: An organization founded by three POC women that do consulting, training, and workshops on anti-racism, Equity Diversity and Inclusion, and sexual harassment prevention.\n\nNew York Times \"Anti-Racist\" Reading List\n\nAnti-Racist Reading List from Ibram X.
