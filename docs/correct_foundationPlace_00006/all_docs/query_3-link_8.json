        "text": "It all started back in 1992, at the Simón Bolívar University in Caracas, Venezuela, where I had the opportunity to study and the pleasure graduate from as a Computer Engineer. It was there I first heard about distributed AI (DAI) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). I also heard about the 5th Generation of Computer Systems (FGCS) which led me to Japan and the Nagoya Institute of Technology where I did my PhD. in MAS, Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems. Back then I was fascinated and intrigued by a Boston startup called Agents Inc., later renamed Firefly Network Inc., founded by Pattie Maes who had an audacious idea around creating Software Agents — small programs that do electronic tasks for their masters and that can, ideally, learn by watching their user’s activities. At the MIT Media Lab, under the supervision of Maes, some of the engineers built a music recommendation system called HOMR (Helpful Online Music Recommendation Service; preceded by RINGO, an email-based system) which used collaborative filtering to help navigate the music domain to find other artists and albums that a user might like. Fast forward 25 years and here I am working at Amazon Music, helping improve Alexa, the digital assistant that became the significant other of the 21st Century, as described many years earlier by the announcer of the presentation that Maes gave at ACM 97: The Next 50 Years of Computing and how intelligent agents will interact with software ecologies.\n\nInspired by Maes and the $100M company she had created, I joined two corporate lawyers in New York City, Renaud Laplanche and Matt Turk, as CTO and co-founder of Matchers Inc., later renamed TripleHop Technologies. Life was tough during the dot-com bust as we barely kept afloat after getting our Series “A”, followed by many VC rejections when we were running out of money. We also got hit by September 11 as our offices were located at the WTC. Fortunately, we didn’t lose anyone and the team and I saved the other company’s assets. We started developing domain-specific recommender systems such as TripMatcher that guessed the importance of attributes that the user does not explicitly mention. It then combines statistics on past user queries with a prediction computed as a weighted average of importance assigned by similar users to generate personalized travel recommendations. But we ended up developing and successfully commercializing MatchPoint, a context-sensitive semantic-based information retrieval solution for the access, classification, and delivery of enterprise information. The three innovations that ultimately led to the acquisition of TripleHop by Oracle in 2005, and my first foray into Silicon Valley were:\n\na) Matchpoint was the first distributed search service and federated search of its kind, based on Apache Lucene. It was able to aggregate query results from both internal indices and external search services; this was way before Apache SOLR or Elasticsearch even existed.\n\nb) Search results document clustering and faceted navigation. The algorithm for realtime clustering within the search results (largely attributed to Hui Ouyang), leveraged the crawler to preprocess the document and capture the keywords, top phrases and their frequencies, and summary/key sentences, etc. The key data structure used in the Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm is a Generalized Suffix Tree (GST) built for all input documents. The algorithm traverses the GST to identify words and phrases that occurred more than once in the input documents. Each such word or phrase gives rise to one base cluster. The last stage of the clustering process is merging base clusters to form the final clusters. We later added faceted navigation based on other document meta-data to complement the topic based clustering.\n\nc) Concept searching technology: Matchpoint automatically generated a enterprise specific thesaurus directly from the enterprise’s own document by mining the text and identifying appropriate Synsets in WordNet at indexing time, later used to expand the user query to synonyms and related terms. We also did text classification based on support vector machines (SVM) using categories emerging from our document clustering algorithm.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Triplehop by Oracle and moving my family to the west coast, I helped develop Oracle Secure Enterprise Search 10g (SES) that offered the ability to ferret out information from the data corners of a company, including internal E-mail, instant messages, mainframe files, corporate portals, and application databases. It was designed to present data, such as purchase orders, in context of its original application. Announced at the Oracle OpenWorld Tokyo 2006 conference in Japan, Larry Ellison touted it as “one of our biggest announcements for many, many years”, a key piece of middleware technology that helped Oracle unify the secure access to information stored in the many different platforms, databases and applications, including Peoplesoft, JD Edwards and Oracle’s Collaboration Suite.\n\nAmongst the many patents that I have under my belt, I feel quite proud of Knowledge extraction for automatic ontology maintenance, that proposed an automated way of creating hyperlinks amongst entities that were extracted during the indexing process of documents and applications in disparate systems that SES dealt with.\n\nMy time at Oracle, as a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, was short and sweet. I had the opportunity to be Oracle’s representative in the W3C XQuery Working Group and contribute to innovation in the search space, while working within the comfort of one of the most recognized brands of the Valley at the time. However, after a year and a half at Oracle, it was time to move on to my next start-up adventure: LendingClub, which turned out to be a complete rollercoaster, filled with tumultuous relationships with co-founders and employees, and the theme of my next chapter of this series describing my Silicon Valley story."
