        "text": "This article addresses the question, what role did the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the creation of the U.S. federal government play in the making of American capitalism? It argues that although I am not the first to pose this question, the answer has slipped between the cracks.\n\nThe topic has been approached in different ways throughout the last several decades. First, historians of the era, including Terry Bouton, Woody Holton, and Michael J. Klarman, have convincingly shown that the Convention was the result of a fear of “excess democracy” by an elite group who built a new state partly to protect elite power, quell rebellion, and limit too much democratic participation in governance by the lower and middle classes.Footnote 1 While these discussions have highlighted the question of class, they have, with some exceptions mentioned later, generally not placed their analysis in the context of the role that state formation played in solidifying or supporting American capitalism overall.\n\nSecond, historians who have worked on the transition to capitalism in U.S. history have demonstrated that the country that became the United States after the American Revolution was not born entirely capitalist.Footnote 2 A snapshot of the United States in 1787 would show a society with a variety of intersecting or “articulating” modes of production. In the North, artisans still often owned their own tools and controlled their own workshops. Yeoman farm families owned their own land and engaged in “safety first” production, partly to satisfy their domestic needs and partly to trade for goods with neighbors or local country stores linked to broader chains of merchants. Coastal merchants can be classified as capitalist, as can those who engaged in land speculation. So can speculators who purchased government securities and owned private debt. In the South, capitalist plantation owners ruled over their personal empires of Black slaves, but in less fertile lands and pine barrens, small yeoman farmers produced primarily for their own households. In the context of a country on its way toward capitalism yet still in transition, Allan Kulikoff and Charles Post have both argued that the result of the American Revolution led to the formation of a new state that would play a key role in ossifying U.S. capitalism.Footnote 3 Yet these accounts have not looked in detail at the formation of the U.S. Constitution and have problematically viewed Southern plantation slavery as noncapitalist, rather than a form of racialized capitalism that the new state was designed to protect.\n\nThird, the question of capitalism and slavery has in many ways been clarified by scholars working in the loosely defined area of the “new history of capitalism.”Footnote 4 Yet it has not always been clear what scholars working in this tradition mean by “capitalism.”Footnote 5 And this work has tended to focus on the history of slavery in the South and the history of business in the North, but it has not always systematically engaged with the older debate that raged in previous decades over capitalism, social property relations, and transitions in modes of production.Footnote 6 Scholars working in this area have tended not to try to solve the problem this article poses, nor has it been their objective to do so.\n\nFourth, scholars of American political development (APD), perhaps most significantly David Brian Robertson, have examined the Convention, demonstrating the goals and challenges the framers faced.Footnote 7 Robertson's book remains an unsurpassed detailing of the politics of the Convention in the context of the creation of the Constitution as a “durable shift in governing authority” and a central concern for APD scholars.Footnote 8 While he does contextualize the Convention in an economic sense, the level of abstraction used does not address the question of social relations of production, state form, and capitalism. Robertson argues that attendees at the Convention were “elite” and that they did not create a new state for personal reasons of economic gain, but rather to build a government that could support market forces and balance competing political and economic interests.Footnote 9 But he never broaches the question of the extent to which different social relations might or might not be considered “capitalist” or the extent to which the new state was built in an age of capitalist transition. Perhaps because of a broader intellectual trajectory in which much of the APD literature has focused more on institution building than the role of the state in relation to modes of production, this work has not answered the question of where the Constitution fits into the history of American capitalism.\n\nIn this context, this article returns to the tradition of historical materialism. I begin by asking these questions: What conceptual tools might be necessary to explain the role of the state in the history of the rise of capitalism? Is there such a thing as a specifically capitalist state? How do institutions and social classes relate? To what extent is state power “autonomous”?Footnote 10\n\nIn returning to these questions, this article sets up the basis for a reconsideration of the Constitutional Convention in the history of the development of American capitalism. First, I provide a snapshot of the state of capitalism in the United States in the late 1700s. This is painted with broad strokes to contextualize the Convention. Second, returning to the original records of the Convention, I examine the ways that the Convention occurred in a society transiting to capitalism and the extent to which the framers were building a capitalistic form of governance. Here, I argue that they worked to construct a relatively autonomous state that would support capitalist interests and, in the long run, capitalist development, but also provide space for noncapitalist or less capitalist relations of production to continue, bringing the lower and middling classes into the state. Elite interests, enshrined in the institutional structure of the state, would be presented as universal hegemonic interests for all social classes—something framers such as James Madison were very consciously attempting to achieve. The new government would also protect the interests of slave-owning capitalists through the compromises that led to the final draft of the Constitution."
