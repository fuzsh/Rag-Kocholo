        "text": "Sir William Petty (1623-1687)\n\nThe method I take…is not yet very usual; for instead of using only comparative and superlative words, and intellectual arguments, I have taken the course to express myself in terms of number, weight, or measure; to use only arguments of sense, and to consider only such causes, as have visible foundations in Nature…\n\nLife\n\nSir William Petty, Henry Spiegel tells us, was “the son of a poor Hampshire clothier [and] an entirely self-made man” (G.E.T., 122). He studied Latin and Greek at his local school and made a living in his early years as a tutor and by trading jewelry. During the English civil war, Petty moved to the Netherlands where he studied a range of subjects including medicine. He then moved to Paris where he worked as an assistant to Thomas Hobbes until the age of twenty-four.\n\nAfter his time in Paris, Petty returned to London and became a member of the ‘invisible college’ – a precursor to the royal society – and a professor of anatomy at Oxford. In 1651, after leaving Oxford, he was appointed to Cromwell’s army as a physician and later was assigned to survey the army’s conquered lands. As a result, he was also put in charge of the distribution of conquered lands amongst English soldiers, and he himself amassed a fortune and a large portion of land during this time. In 1659, Petty returned to London where he served as an MP, became a founding member of the Royal Society, and continued his studies in science. It was during this period that he wrote most of his treatises on economics, politics, and statistics. He died in 1687.\n\nContributions\n\nPetty wrote a good number of works on economics most of which can be found compiled in C.H. Hull’s The Economic Writings of Sir William Petty (digital copy from the Liberty Fund here). He was also involved in surveying the mortality rate in London – a project in which he collaborated with John Graunt (1620-1674) – and is most generally recognized as one of the first men to apply basic statistical analysis to economics. For now, I’ll provide a few words on A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions (1662).\n\nA Treatise of Taxes and Contributions was published in 1662 and consists of fifteen chapters in which Petty describes why taxes are necessary, what tax revenues ought to be used for, and what aggravates the effective collection and use of taxes. Like many of his writings, the topic seems to have been inspired by Petty’s observations of the state of affairs in Ireland where England levied heavy taxes on a people plagued with poverty.\n\nPetty argued that taxes were without a doubt necessary to bolster the economy and pay for things that fell under the ‘public charge’ (things like infrastructure, public administration, defense, education, welfare for the poor, and even the guidance of men’s consciences). Nevertheless, they were hard to collect due to the unwillingness of people to pay them, the reluctance of people towards having taxes imposed upon them, bad administration of tax collection, excessive spending by the state, etc. These difficulties could be partially alleviated by improving the efficiency of tax collection and expenditure, but also by making the general public more aware of the benefits of taxation. Taxes should be proportional to the wealth of those being taxed and the state should be made more aware of the size and characteristics of the populations being taxed, Petty argued. Those being taxed should understand that money spent by the state through tax revenues would eventually make its way back to the hands of workers. Taxes could efficiently bolster the economy in any state regardless of size and population, so long as those in the state had a good sense of the output, population, and wealth distribution of the nation. We begin to see why Petty valued ‘measurement’ so much. For him, a ‘well-policyed’ state depended on a thorough understanding of the mechanics and magnitudes of of money, demography, and production.\n\nThroughout the rest of the book, Petty explores a number of different forms of taxation, and in particular, digresses into a discussion about rents. In this part of the argument (chapter 4), he touches upon a labor theory of value and begins to describe labor and land as the primary inputs in production. Here again, Petty aims at measurement. He wants to find a way to meausre every bit of output in terms of units of labor and land and strives further to a find ‘a natural par’ between these two major inputs. In this chapter, Petty anticipates the work of economists like Ricardo and Marx. Further along in the book, Petty goes on to explore taxes in trade, taxes on consumption (which he advocates) and other familiar topics of the time such as usury, debasement, and the legitimacy of monopolies.\n\nMajor Works\n\nA Treatise of Taxes and Contributions (1662)\n\nVerbum Sapienti (1664)\n\nPolitical Anatomy of Ireland (1672)\n\nPolitical Arithmetic (1676?)\n\nQuantulumcunque Concerning Money (1682)\n\nRelated Readings\n\nThe Economic Writings of Sir William Petty compiled by C.H.
