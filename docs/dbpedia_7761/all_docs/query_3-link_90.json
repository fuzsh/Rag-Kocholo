        "text": "Thanks for this, Chris. It’s particularly interesting to me, since I’ve just been teaching Marx to “newbies” (I’ve been doing so in discussion sections of 12-13 students, rather than lectures; obviously, the format has affected the way that I’ve approached the topic). Our approaches are largely similar, I think, but there are a few areas where we differ:\n\n1) Since we’d been looking at Hegel, I started out by contrasting Marx’s account of history and his method of social explanation to Hegels — which centred on discussion of the distinction between base and superstructure, and claim that the base determines the superstructure.\n\n2) I didn’t make heavy weather of the economic theory, but I did emphasize Marx’s own emphasis on labour — and that his economic theory rests on the labour theory of value (I didn’t mention that this is now pretty universally rejected by economists)\n\n3) I talked a bit more about reification than it seems like you would in your Marx spiel (not using that term, but trying to give the basic idea)\n\n4) I raised (or, rather, allowed my students to raise — which, bless them, they did) the ticklish subject of Marx’s critique of capitalism and morality — which seems to be absent from your summary.\n\n5) Next week we’ll be going on to Mill, so I plan to start out with a discussion of what Marx means by freedom — and also his critique of the bourgeois state and of rights.\n\nI think points 4) and 5) are important, though also tricky, to emphasize. On the one hand, one doesn’t want to reinforce preconceived notions of Marx as totalitarian bogey-man (particularly since I’ve already had to defend Hobbes and Hegel from charges of totalitarianism.) On the other, it does seem to me important to stress that Marx’s critique of capitalism is not a matter of liberal humanitarianism; and that he believed that, if his analysis was correct — and if one takes his claims seriously — simply remaining wedded to a (more egalitarian version or interpretation of) liberal theories of human rights just won’t cut it. I guess this is sort of implied when you make mention of the appearance of freedom and equality in contrast to the reality of exploitation and oppression. But, from this bare summary, I could see your account making Marx seem more reconcilable to a sort of left-liberal humanitarianism than I think he is, or should be presented as being.\n\n(I, also, didn’t discuss Stalin, Pol Pot, etc. Though come to think of it, I should make more of the difference between Marx and Marxism next week.)\n\nI certainly think Chris would be right about how to give that first Marx lecture to a first-year class of newbies. And I don’t see any indication that that’s anything like Brad’s student audience for this lecture. This reads to me like something pitched to much more advanced students who’ve already read a fair bit.\n\nIf this is an evaluative, what-shall-we-take-away, why-did-I-just have-you-do-that-reading, why-have-we-just-spent-two-weeks-on-this-stuff lecture– a different genre from the exegetical introductory lecture– how many objections here would fall away?\n\nFor my part, I’d never dismiss Hegel in that way– but if I were teaching Marx to undergrad economists in a history of economic thought class, I might well rush past Hegel pretty quickly. Moreover, for that audience I would certainly talk about 20th-century Marxism– not to specially demonize Marx, but because those students aren’t there just for the love of getting the great philosophers right. Talking about the impacts ideas have on the world, even if the ideas are badly distorted en route, is part of teaching that class to those students. In some classes with some writs and purposes, but not others, talking about Locke should include talking about the Declaration of Independence as well as about the expropriation of Indian lands in the Americas– not in either case to understand Locke, or to understand the events as transparent and undistorted carryings-out of the ideas, but in to show that ideas have (complicated) ongoing lives in the world, and to show that when they go to their next class and study Facts, they shouldn’t forget about their study of ideas.\n\nI would think it a little odd if a student who’d taken an intro theory class from me and studied Locke, Rousseau, or Marx then had to be surprised in some history class to see Locke’s name come up in association with the American Revolution, Rousseau’s with the French, Marx’s with Communism, etc. We assume that that kind of thing is in the air and we don’t have to trouble ourselves with it– but even the Marx association shouldn’t be taken for granted anymore. Is it really bad for students to hear in their intro class that Communism was a real thing in the world (back before they were born) and that it had, or claimed to have, something to do with Marx?\n\nAnd when theorists/ philosophers draw some of those connections in class ourselves, we can also reclaim some control over them– “what ideas of Rousseau’s did the Jacobins have to willfully ignore?”, etc.\n\nChris,\n\nAlthough it is so often a sign of pretentiousness to cite oneÂ´s own posts, IÂ´ll take the risk and cite a couple passages from my post to BradÂ´s blog as the post somehow failed to appear, no doubt because of some technical reasons. Anyway, I shall cite only parts that are directly relevant vis-a-vis your comments. So, here they are:\n\nBrad says: “But the only person to try it seriously soon throws the Marxist apparatus over the side, where it splashes and sinks to the bottom of the sea. Perry Anderson’s Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism and Lineages of the Absolutist State are great and fascinating books, but they are not Marxist. They are Weberian. The key processes in Anderson’s books concern not â€œmodes of productionâ€ but rather â€œmodes of domination.â€\n\nChacona says: I share your admiration for these two works of Perry Anderson. I also agree with you that AndersonÂ´s works highlight the grave difficulty of trying to extend distinctions that Marx and his followers made vis-a-vis capitalism to “pre-capitalist social formations”. Hence the difficulty of separating “economy” and “polity”, indeed “base” and “superstructure” in “pre-capitalist societies” in the same way as in capitalism. But it does not follow that Anderson is simply “Weberian”, unless you think of a Weberian who is always very interested in the disposal of surpluses in various social formations. After all, what is common to all these social formations is the existence of a surplus beyond the need of simple reproduction. All things become so much clearer when one approaches these questions from the point of reproduction:\n\nAll the same, raising to discussion AndersonÂ´s difficulties with matching the Marxian framework of interpretation and analysis with the realities his sources imply, is certainly rare in discussions “mainstream economists” tend to have. Thanks for showing uncommon intellectual curiosity!\n\nBrad says: “Karl Marx never completed the intellectual trajectory he set himself on. He tried as hard as he could to become a British-style classical economist- -a “minor post-Ricardian theorist” as Paul Samuelson once joked–but he did not make it: the late, mature Marx is mostly an economist and economic historian, but he is also part political activist–and also part prophet.”\n\nChacona says: The traditional (Leninist) intellectual biography of how “socialism became a science” tells a story of how German philosophy, French socialism and British political economy joined forces to give us “scientific” socialism. And that is pretty accurate: no need to claim that Lenin was always wrong. But you seem to hint ever so subtly that this blend of philosophy, revolutionary activism and economics must be bad and that all would have been so much better if Marx had been a little bit more mature and scientific: he could have taken then his just place among the many minor Ricardians. (By the way, who are the non-Ricardians among the mainstream economists?)\n\nWell, I agree with you that Marx inherited from Hegel, from French revolutionary tradition and also from British “classical economists” ideas and ways of thinking that were deeply problematical and that eventually became – at least in the hands of some of his followers – extremely dangerous. Far from becoming intellectual weapons of emancipation for the “downtrodden proletarian masses”, they became an ideology for restless “intelligentsia” that was looking for a way to assert its dominance in societies where aristocratic dominance seemed to be giving way to bourgeois institutions and values. That is where we can find the origins of “teleocratic power”, the claim of Communist Parties that they know – not the ignorant masses! – the correct ends of human activity. (Compare with Weberian technocrats who “merely” claim to know better than others the correct means necessary for reaching the ends that are themselves beyond the competence of the technocrats.) No doubt about it, while Marx himself viewed the Paris Commune as the representative of “proletarian dictatorship”, his followers did not find it too difficult to turn their illusions of grandeur into delusions of omnipotence and eventually shift from the dictatorship of the Party to the dictatorship of the Leading Comrade – as indeed some perceptive Marxists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) had correctly predicted..\n\nBut enough of this sordid history here. I shall nevertheless claim that what Marx has but many professional mainstream economists do not have is a sense of history and a sense of philosophical understanding. Sure, Marx got so many things wrong, but it is better to be red than dead!….\n\nSocial Democracy as the Marxism prophylaxis\n\n“that even though the ruling class could appease the working class by using the state to redistribute and share the fruits of economic growth it would never do so. They would be trapped by their own ideological legitimations–they really do believe that it is in some sense â€œunjustâ€ for a factor of production to earn more than its marginal product. Hence social democracy would inevitably collapse before an ideologically-based right-wing assault, income inequality would rise, and the system would collapse or be overthrown. The Wall Street Journal editorial page works day and night 365 days a year to make Marxâ€™s prediction come true. But I think this, too, is wrong.”\n\n“I think that Western Europe over the past fifty years serves as a significant counterexample. It may be difficult to maintain a democratic capitalist market system with an acceptable distribution of income. But “incapable” is surely too strong. Beveridgism or Myrdalism–social democracy, progressive income taxes, a very large and well-established safety net, public education to a high standard, channels for upward mobility, and all the panoply of the twentieth-century social- democratic mixed-economy democratic state can banish all Marxâ€™s fears that capitalist prosperity must be accompanied by great inequality and great misery.”\n\nHow anyone writing from the US of A, where whatever Social Democratic prophylaxis we’ve had agaist the revolution predicted by Marx has been clearly on the run for 30 years, could be so confident that Myrdalism is robust enough to keep the Marxist apocalypse at bay, is beyond me. DeLong succeeds only, especially in this economic crisis we are in right now, in making it seem like this Marx fellow maybe deserves a second look as some sort of prophetic genius. Perhaps that’s his Socratic intention.\n\nIf the idea that capital has some sort of moral right to impoverish and devastate everything in its path as it follows the course of self-aggrandizement, were limited to the WSJ editorial page, we would not be in this current crisis. It took a consensus that government regulation is anathema, a faith held in the face of all evidence to the contrary, to give us the shadow banking system that ate Detroit, and looks to soon finish eating the rest of our economy.\n\nThat faith survives even in the face of the present crisis. I don’t think that Social Democratic principles are much in evidence in the measures we have adopted so far to meet the crisis. But if we won’t turn to these principles now, if the crisis hasn’t thoroughly debunked free market fundamentalism, and our grand plan of salvation is to reinflate all market bubbles — I really don’t see any room for confidence at all that Social Democracy can save us from that final confrontation between reactionary defenders of the privileges of great wealth, and the rest of us.\n\nI’m not sure that publishing a Five Minute Hate on any particular economic thinker or school of thought, would be very helpful in any circumstance. But a polemic targeted anywhere but in at least the general direction of Milton Friedman and the cult he founded, at this point in time, pretty much puts you right up there with the editorial page of the WSJ on the side of mindless reaction.\n\nActually, belle, several people here made versions of that point. I myself said that Marx had “ironized” LTV: labor is only the source of “value” because it has already been alienated. And the whole point of Marx’ deployment of LTV is to explicate the key notion of “surplus-value”.\n\nI was ridiculed by Radek earlier on this thread for mentioning Okishio’s theorem, as if I thought it should be the stuff of an introductory lecture for “newbies”. But my point was the DeLong, if he wants to be taken seriously, with his scholarly pretensions, as an explicator of Marx, should himself have taken account of the formal-rational and mathematical reconstructions of Marx’ economics,- (which itself needs to be “surgically” removed from a more complex project and set of purposes, which itself requires understanding Marx’ conceptual method, in order to know how to go about the “surgery”),- for which the neo-Ricardan criticisms of the Sraffans and Okishio’s theorem especially provided the impetus. (Okishio’s theorem, if anyone doesn’t know, purports to prove mathematically that productivity-enhancing capital investment increases the rate of profit, thus refuting Marx’ claim for “the tendential law of the falling rate of profit”. The first response is, of course, it does, else such investments aren’t made,- that little bit about relations of production constraining forces of production,- but then Okishio’s theorem, in layman’s terms, makes a price-taking assumption, which is scarcely realistic for the competitive conditions under which such investments are made, and so defeats its own point). But rather than adequately informing himself on the scholarship, DeLong insists on reading Marx in hermeneutically inappropriate neo-classical terms and repeating shop-worn neo-classical criticisms that themselves are demonstrably false,- (note, for example, how he assimilates “use-value” to “utility”, the former not being a separate item, but a “contradictory” aspect of the value-form of the commodity, which itself is not a real thing, but a ghostly form “stamped” on concrete things),- which amounts to sheer academic non-feasance and incompetence, i.e. bad faith. It’s usual in one of his hissy-fit performances with respect to Marx for DeLong to go prattling on about the “transformation problem” and its unsolvability, as a decisive refutation of Marx, without the slightest awareness that it was the neo-classicals who invented the “problem” by re-normalizing each production period as at equilibrium, and thereby themselves double-counted, which Marx did not do, since his whole aim was to demonstrate the long-run, cumulative disequilibrium tendencies of industrial capitalist systems. Note how DeLong sneers at Marx’ invocation of “essence”, without evincing any awareness that Marx’ whole mode of presentation, (Darstellung), is organized in terms of an Hegelian dialectic of essence and appearance, in which essence is by no means to be opposed to appearance, let alone referent to some separate, noumenal reality, but is entirely manifested, through the successive stages of conceptual unfolding/development, through the sequences of inevitably partial appearances, though the “essence” is frequently manifested in inverted form by its appearance, (as when, e.g., falling real profits from production might be manifested in inflated financial asset prices). Hence DeLong has no recognition that his “criticisms” are based on his holding a completely inverted understanding of the actual content and thrust of Marx’ claims. No only is there no “transformation problem” of the sort DeLong and his ilk imagine, that labor-values need to be transformed into prices-of-production in order to take account of actual distributions across differing “organic compositions of capital” across sectors, but Marx’ actual point is that prices-of-production, (which after all are crucial to the “law of supply and demand”), can not be determined without first determining distributions (of surplus-value). (That’s oddly similar to Sraffa’s claim that technical co-efficients of production can not be determined separately from the rate of profit, or the distribution of the surplus product between wages and profits). Indeed, the whole claim that Marx’ deployment of LTV can not provide an empirical account of nominal price formation, as if that is what he should be aiming at and then all else would be settled, is not just wide of the mark, but entirely misses the point, since not only are nominal prices constantly changing, but Marx is intent on demonstrating how nominal prices can significantly deviate from underlying value formation. Which is especially the case in the Vol. 3 account of credit, financialization ,and the generation of fictional capital. No, Marx’ account is not only completely erroneous, but entirely outmoded, and has nothing left to teach us, not even heuristically.\n\nI could go on about DeLong’s attempt to style Marx as a chiliastic-utopian religious fanatic. But I’ll just remark that Marx did not actually have a critique of religion. Instead, he had a critique of the critique of religion.\n\nRe: Radek @94\n\nThere’s nothing you’re saying there that I don’t already know. Capitalists invest in productivity-enhancement under competitive conditions to reduce costs and thereby gain competitive advantage by lowering output prices and gaining market-share. And not the least of those costs are wage-costs. So in the short-to-medium-run, labor becomes dis-employed, even if wages of remaining workers rise”, only to be re-employed “at lower wages in more labor intensive sectors, output prices competitively decline, and less-productive capital stocks are competitively devalued and forced out, even as the costs of maintaining long-run, uncertain productivity-enhanced capital stocks rise. Hence the profits to innovative capital investment rise, even as the value of and return to aggregate capital stocks decline. Add to that, that the value of capital stocks is not to be booked at their initial historical cost, but rather at their reproduction/replacement cost, and you get a fairly paradoxical situation, in which increasing concentrations of capital/capital intensities, which increase the real distributable surplus-product, lower unit profits, lower the wage-share in aggregate demand, raise investment costs sine qua non, and require a further expansion of markets to dispose of excess output. Hence a “tendential law of the falling rate of profits”, which is a fairly plausible root account of the production/business/trade cycle and its recurrent crises, as over-investment meets up with under-consumption, deficient wage-based demand. Apparently, Marx thought that the accumulation of such crises would render them increasingly severe, as the accumulation of the “forces of production”, which include available technical means, as well as the work “force”,- and why should human knowledge, skill, and experience be arbitrarily re-designated “human capital”?- ran against the limits imposed by the “relations of production”, economically speaking, the capacity of the system to write down capital losses to re-balance them with the available “mass” of labor-value. But that “law” is a tendency, not a deterministic covering law, which ought to invite the question of possible countervailing tendencies or policy responses. Can excess public expenditures or transfers provide for the short-falls in consumption demand or provide extra, alternative avenues for capital investment,- (weapons, weapons, weapons!)-? Maybe, but to a fully sufficient extent? (At any rate, it was a Marxist economist, Michael Kalecki who first discovered the principle of real aggregate effective demand, but, since he wrote in Polish and a bit in French, no one noticed, though, in fairness, it would be another case of simultaneous independent discovery, like Newton/Leibniz or Darwin/Wallace). Schumpeter was to re-style this dynamic “creative destruction”, to the delight of gleeful yuppies everywhere, but then he too was worried about the prospect of “secular stagnation”. Again, Marx’ account was one of long-run dynamic dis-equilibrium. Why would you be so sure that general equilibrium accounts could so readily trump that prospect, (even if we now possess much better math to model Marx’ intuitions)?\n\n“â€œsocially necessary labor timeâ€ is the point where, even if it was capable of explaining relative prices (and all else is metaphysics)”- Er, that’s a piece of positivist idiocy and philosophical illiteracy. You can’t distinguish a critique of metaphysics from metaphysics itself? And sheerly economically speaking, it expresses the sort of view that claims that aggregate cumulative debt doesn’t matter, only debt servicing costs, ’cause, ya know, interest rates won’t ever deviate from what’s required. “What the hey is it? Who determines whether labor time is socially necessary or not?”- Still, more basically, are you so hung up on methodological individualism that you don’t recognize that conditional constraints and cross-secting consequences of the activities of individual agents generate structures that were not intended by anyone? It’s certainly not Marx who invented hourly wages, and clearly his account is that it’s the “system” itself that “competitively” abstracts/extracts “socially necessary labor time”. Have you ever actually worked a factory job? Or managed a factory?\n\nAs to Marx’ deployment of LTV being simply and obviously false, well, since labor-value is always already alienated and abstracted/extracted, it’s not as if labor is “embodied” in its output, but rather labor-values are already “ghostly”. Labor-value is precisely not some sort of mysterious metaphysical substance with occult causal powers. (Hegel had already eviscerated such traditional notions of metaphysical substance). Rather labor-value amounts to an accounting convention rather than a unique explanatory force. To be sure, one can adopt a different system of accounting, just as one can adopt a different explanatory framework. But a convention is not simply and obviously false, but rather more-or-less useful within an explanatory framework. And in general, it’s not a good idea to attribute to Marx gross economic stupidities, since he was a mean economist and thoroughly well-read and critically responsive to virtually all the economic literature available in his day and age. So Marx is precisely not claiming. e.g., that labor intensive sectors are producing/extracting more labor-value than capital-intensive sectors, since labor is the source of all value, which would be utterly stupid. Marx is a good deal closer to common sense and more empirical than he’s often given credit for, and I think those readings whereby he takes commodity-money wages and prices as prima facie, rough-and-ready equivalents or indicators of labor-values are on the mark. (There’s no need to translate a wage into a basket of wage-goods and calculate the labor input to those goods, etc.) Rather he’s tracing out the pathways by which labor-values deviate from nominal prices, from the assumption of their ready equivalence. So concentrated, capital-intensive sectors are producing more value than diffuse labor-intensive sectors, because, due to oligopolistic market-power and the rents accruing to it, they are drawing labor-value off of those other sectors. There might be other accounting conventions and alternative explanations, but it’s hard to claim that such a phenomenon is unrealistic or not empirically evident. Similarly, Marx accounts capital goods, like labor-power, as always exchanged at value. But that does not mean that he’s claiming that capital goods, as “factors of production”, do not yield increased surpluses. Rather, since a capital good has no use-value other than the production of exchange-values, and since capital goods are valued at replacement costs, they can’t somehow produce their own value, independent from their realization in output. That’s a logically coherent accounting, even if others might be essayed. In fact, Marx’ LTV has been shown formally to be consistent, such that, given that labor is chosen as the numaire, labor-value input results “magically” in a surplus of labor-value output. The problem, of course, is that, by the same formalism, if corn were chosen as the numaire, then a corn-theory-of-value would result, with corn inputs producing corn-surpluses. So there must be some peculiar non-formal attribute of labor that would qualify it as a privileged numaire. The other generalized result of the formal-rational reconstruction of Marx’ economics is that, indeed, his LTV accounting holds up well, such that the “mass” of labor-values,- (and here the alleged transformation problem simply drops out “macro-economically”),- correlates with the flow of input-output prices, provided the economy is growing in an inter-sectorally balanced way, but, if not, his LTV falls apart. Somehow I think Marx would not have been surprised by such a formal result.\n\nMore generally, any economic framework of explanation must rely on some sort of standard of “value”, let’s call it, at minimum, a principle of least effort, just as purely physical explanations rely on a conception of energy as doing “work”, as with Carnot heat engine cycles. The core idea of “economy” is systematically producing more output/welfare/satisfaction from less “resources”. It is not obvious that the capacities, needs, and well-being of laborers should be held of no account in providing such a standard of “efficiency”. It’s also not obvious that the maximalization of individual utitility preference functions can actually do such “work”.\n\nAs for “exploitation”, it’s far more a functional than a normative concept in Marx. Capitalists “necessarily” exploit workers, since labor is already alienated and otherwise the extraction of surplus-value wouldn’t result. But then, Marx was not exactly averse to the extraction of social surpluses. He just wanted to re-organize the processes by which it was effected and distributed. Marx is constantly playing with the old freedom vs. necessity problem, such that human agents “freely” produce the conditions of their own unfreedom and subjection, so that workers, in objectifying and expressing themselves in their own products are already alienated from them and subjected to “the law of value” and capitalists, in seeking to maximalize profits, compulsively drive each other into bankruptcy and drive down the rate-of-profit, etc. But Marx remained wedded to the basic Hegelian framework, whereby norms only had meaning, let alone validity, if they were anchored and embodied in the recognitions of actual social relations and practices. Hence no matter how conflicted and self-divided the consciousness and recognition of social norms, they could only be resolved through the course of actual social conflict, rather than through any liberalistic appeal to moral “values”. Hence, I’m not sympathetic, on grounds of hermeneutic accuracy, to attempts to reconstruct Marx’ thought/work in terms of Analytic philosophy, normative political philosophy, methodological individualism, rational choice theory, technological functionalism, etc., while declaring Hegel “bullshit”. Like it or not, Marx is thoroughly rooted in Hegelian dialectics, even if he himself might have mis-understood Hegel somewhat and erroneously reified the latter’s conceptual-reflective method as a “materialist” reality. I think Marx is very much a “dead dog”, in roughly the same sense that he declared Hegel to be, in a letter written when he was re-reading Hegel’s “Logic” to bone up for writing “Capital”. The mystery is why Marx chose to present his epic account in a thoroughly Hegelian idiom, when, by the 1850’s, Hegel had been largely forgotten, was scarcely read, and even less understood. There’s a peculiar sense of rigor in that.\n\nNo sleight on Mill (though your interpretation of him is another matter), but that’s a horrible argument. It may be right in some particular circumstances, but as an argument, it’s, h, o, r, r, i, b, l, e.. The reason why it’s a horrible argument is that the (unstated) implications of the two quoted statements are the same, but they are actually two entirely different things. So the (unstated) implications are not really the same. The problem is that that kind of argument can be applied to pretty much anything:\n\np1 “But Ted doesn’t like the Ohio Buckeyes, he supports the Michigan Wolverines!”\n\na “Yes, just like women opposed (and oppose) feminism and support patriarchy”\n\np2″But Ted doesn’t like Crooked Timber, he actually reads Brad DeLong”\n\na “Yes, just like women opposed (and oppose) feminism and support patriarchy”\n\np3″But Ted isn’t a fan of the Blues, he supports the Greens”\n\na “Yes, just like women opposed (and oppose) feminism and support patriarchy”\n\np4″But Ted is a cat person, not a dog person”\n\na “Yes, just like women opposed (and oppose) feminism and support patriarchy”\n\nIt’s basically a trick to try to win an argument by associating something with something completely irrelevant, and it’s cheap and low down too because it refuses to actually state its premises directly – the supposed conclusion, the a) part, the “Yes, just like women…” being said in a sarcastic tone (obviously) and the more nasal your intonation the less sense you actually have to make here.\n\nThis is aside from the fact that, whatever Mill says about the prevelance of the female fifth column within the feminist movement, it probably really ain’t there that much. One way or another, most women don’t like to be oppressed just like, crazily enough, no other persons like to be oppressed. I’ve known a plenty of women in my life time (no, really!). Only like 2 of them supported the patriarchy. Maybe 4 had mixed feelings. The vast washed, manicured, and groomed masses of the double X chromosome carriers were very much against it. The unwashed ones too, but on this hippy blog that’s taken as already understood and a given.\n\nAnyway, it’s actually possible that 1) workers are exploited and 2) workers support capitalism because they gain from it, relative to any other system devised by man.\n\nThis is the key (and the serious part here) – which makes it different from the supposed feminism example."
