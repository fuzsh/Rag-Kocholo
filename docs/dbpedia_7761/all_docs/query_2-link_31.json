        "text": "KARL MARX AND MARXISM\n\nMcLellan, D. (1995) The Thought of Karl Marx, London: Papermac.\n\nThe Correspondence of 1843\n\nMan must recognize his own forces as social forces, organize them and thus no longer separate social forces from himself in the form of political forces. Only when this has been achieved will human emancipation be completed. 19\n\nParis Manuscripts\n\nThat the necessary result of competition is the accumulation of capital int a few hands, and thus a a more terrible restoration of monopoly; and that finally the distinction between capitalist and landlord, and that between peasant and industrial worker disappears and the whole of society must fall apart into the two classes of the property owners and the propertyless workers. 23\n\nSupposing that we have produced in a human manner; each of us would in his production have doubly affirmed himself and his fellow men. I would have: (1) objectified in my production my individuality and its peculiarity and thus both in my activity enjoys an individual expression of my life and also I looking at the object have had the individual pleasure of realizing my personality was objective, visible to the senses and thus a power raised beyond all doubt. (2) In your enjoyment or use of my product I would have had the direct enjoyment of realizing that I had both satisfied a human need by my work and also objectified the human essence and therefore fashioned for another human being the object that met his need. (3) I would have been for you the mediator between you and the species and thus been acknowledged an felt by you as a completion of your own essence and a necessary part of yourself and have thus realized that I am confirmed both in your thought and in your love. (4) In my expression of my life I would have fashioned your expression of your life, and thus in my own activity have realized my own essence, my human, my communal essence. (23)\n\nIt [Communism] is the genuine solution of the antagonism between man and nature and between man and man. (24)\n\nOn the Jewish Question, 1843-4\n\nRevolution in general - the overthrown of the existing power and dissolution of previous relationships - is a political act. Socialism cannot be realized without a revolution. But when its organizing activity begins, when its peculiar aims, its soul comes forward, then socialism casts aside its political cloak. 25\n\nMan must recognize his own forces s social forces, organize them and thus no longer separate social forces from himself in the form of political forces. Only when this has been achieved will human emancipation be completed. (215)\n\nFrom the political point of view the state and any organization of society are not two distinct things. The state is the organization of society. In so far as the state admits the existence of social abuses, it seeks their origin either in natural laws that no human power can control or in the private sector which is independent of it or in the inadequacy of the administration that depends on the state...\n\nThe state cannot abolish the contradiction which exits between the role and good intentions of the administration on the one hand and the means at its disposal on the other, without abolishing itself, for it rests on this contradiction. It rests on the contrast between public and private life, on the contrast between general and particular interests. The administration must therefore limit itself to a formal and negative activity, for its power ceases just where civil life and work begin.\n\nCritical notes on 'The King of Prussia and Social Reform,' 1844\n\nIf the modern state wished to do away with the impotence of its administration, it would have to do away with the contemporary private sphere for it only exists in contrast to the private sphere. 215\n\n1844 Manuscripts\n\nCommunism is completed naturalism is humanism and as completed humanism is naturalism. It is the genuine solution of the antagonism between man and nature and between man and man. It is the true solution of the struggle between an essence, between objectification and self-affirmation, between freedom and necessity, between individual and species. It is the solution to the riddle of history and knows itself to be this solution. 242\n\nThe Holy Family, 1844-5\n\nHistory...does not use man to realize its own ends, as though it were a particular person: it is merely the activity of men pursuing his own objectives. 31\n\nIdeas never lead beyond the established situation, the only lead beyond the ideas of the established situation. Ideas can accomplish absolutely nothing. To become real, ideas require men who apply a practical force. (\")\n\nIf man is by nature social, then he develops his true nature only in society and the power and the power of his nature must be measured not by the power of the single individual but by the power of society. (\", 32)\n\nIf correctly understood interest is the principle of all morals, man's private interest must be made to coincide with the interest of humanity. (\", 126)\n\nthe working class would set up 'an association which excludes class division and which will have no political power properly speaking'. (240)\n\nThe German ideology, 1946\n\nHe [man] begins to distinguish himself from the animal the moment he begins to produce his means of subsistence, a step required by his physical organization. By producing food, man indirectly produces his material life itself. 33\n\nWhat they [individuals] are, therefore, coincides with what they produce, and how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions which determine their production. (\"34).\n\nthat not criticism but revolution is the driving force of history. (\", 128)\n\nThe production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men, the language of real life.\n\nMen, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with their actual world also their thinking and the products of their thinking. (\", 152)\n\n...definite individuals who are productively active in a specific way enter into these definite social and political relations. Empirical observation must in each separate instance bring out empirically, and without any mystification and speculation, the connection of the social and political structure with production. The social structure and the state continually evolve out of the life process of definite individuals, individuals...as they work, produce materially, and act under definite material limitations, presuppositions, and conditions independent of their work. (209)\n\nThe material life of individuals, which by no means depends merely on their 'will', their mode of production and form of intercourse, which mutually determine each other - this is the real basis of the State and remains so at all the stages at which division of labor and private property are still necessary, quite independently of the will of individuals. (160)\n\nEach new class which puts itself in place of the one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aims, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society...The class making a revolution appears from the very start...not as a class but as a representative of the whole society. (182)\n\nThe extension of trade, the establishment of communications, led the separate towns to get to know other towns, which had asserted the same interests in the struggle with the same antagonist. (189)\n\nIn all revolutions up till now the mode of activity always remained unscathed and it was a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labor to other persons, whilst communist revolution is directed against the preceding mode of activity, does away with labor, and abolishes the rule of all classes with the classes themselves, because it is carried through by the class which no longer counts as a class in society, is not recognized as a class, as is in itself the expression of the dissolution of all classes, nationalities, etc., within present society; and both for the production on a mass scale of this Communist consciousness, and for the success of the caus itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, in a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed I riding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew. (229)\n\nIn revolutionary activity, the changing of oneself coincides with the changing of circumstances. (225)\n\nThe coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice. (230)\n\nThe Poverty of Philosophy, 1847\n\nAre men free to choose this or that form of society for themselves? By no means. 35\n\nSocial relations are intimately bound up with productive forces. In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production, and in changing their mode of production, their manner of making a living, they change all their social relations. (\", 36)\n\nBecause of the simple fact that every succeeding generation finds itself in possession of the productive forces acquired by the previous generation, which serve it as the raw material for new production, a coherence arises in human history, a history of humanity which takes shape is all the more a history of humanity as the productive forces of man and therefore his social relations have been more developed. (\", 129)\n\nCommunist Manifesto, 1848\n\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all. 45\n\nThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.\n\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of contending classes. (opening words).\n\nDoes it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views and conceptions, in one word, man's consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and his social life?\n\nWhat else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class. (123)\n\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. (\", 46)\n\nThe executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. (218)\n\nThe proletariate, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being exploded into the air. (231)\n\nWhen in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lode its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. (239)\n\nAddress to the communist League, 1850\n\nBut they (the proletariate) themselves must do the upmost for their final victory, by clarifying their minds as to what their class interests are... 47\n\nThe 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, 1852\n\nIn so far as millions of families live under economic conditions of existence that separate their mode of life, their interests and their culture from those of the other classes, and put them in hostile opposition to the latter, they form a class. 192\n\nMen make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. (232)\n\nMarx to Weydemeyer, 1852\n\nWhat I did that was new was to prove: (1) that the existence of classes in only bound up with particular historical phases in the development of production, (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariate, (3) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition of the abolition of all classes and to a classless society. 193\n\nOutlines of a Critique of Political Economy, 1857\n\n...is not that production, distribution, exchange and consumption are all identical, but that they are all members of one entity, different aspects of one unit. 65\n\nGrundrisse, 1857\n\nThe assertion that free competition is the final form of the development of productive forces, and thus of human freedom, means only that the domination of the middle class is the end of the world's history... 68\n\ncapital has pushed beyond national boundaries and prejudices, beyond deification of nature and the inherited self-sufficient satisfaction of existing needs confined within well defined bounds, and the reproduction of the traditional way of life. It is destructive of all of this, and permanently revolutionary, tearing down all obstacles that impede the development of productive forces, the expansion of needs, the diversity of production and the exploitation and exchange of natural and intellectual forces. (\"69)\n\n...an altered means of distribution will derive from an altered new basis of production emerging from the historical process. (\"72)\n\nPreface to A critique of Political Economy, 1859\n\nIn broad outlines Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production - antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism, but of one arising from the social conditions of life of the individuals; at the same time the productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism. This social formation brings, therefore, the prehistory of human society to a close. 164\n\nIn the social production which men carry on, they enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will; these relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development of their material powers of production. The sum total of these productive relations constitutes the economic structure of society - the real foundation on which rise legal and political superstructures, and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social, political, and spiritual processes of life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but on the contrary their social existence determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or - what is but a legal expression for the same thing - with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed.\n\nNo social order ever disappears before all the productive forces, for which there is room in it, have developed, and the new higher relations of production never appear before the conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society...the problem itself only arises when the material conditions necessary for its solution already exist or at least in the process of their formation. (233)\n\nTheories of Surplus Value, 1862\n\nfrom the specific form of material production arises in the first place a specific structure of society, in the second place a specific relation of men to nature. Their State and their spiritual outlook is determined by both. Therefore also the kind of their spiritual production. 165\n\nInaugural Address, 1864\n\nlike slave labor, like serf labor, hired labor is but a transitory and inferior form, destined to disappear before associated labor plying its toil with a willing hand, a ready mind and a joyous heart. 178\n\nthat the emancipation of the working class must be conquered by the working class themselves...that the economic subjugation of the man of labor to the monopolizer of the means of labor...lies at the bottom of servitude in all its forms of social misery, mental degradation and political dependence. That the economic emancipation of the working class is therefore the great end to which every political movement ought to be subordinate as a means. That all efforts aiming at this great end have hitherto failed from want of solidarity between the manyfold divisions of labor in each country, and from the absence of a fraternal bond of union between the working classes of different countries....for these means the undersigned...have taken the steps necessary for founding the International Working Men's Association. (I. Berlin, 185)\n\nResults of the Immediate Process of Production, 1865\n\nThus a total economic revolution is taking place. On the one hand, this process creates first of all the real conditions of the domination of capital over work, perfects them and gives them an adequate form; on the other hand it brings to birth, within the productive forces of labor and the conditions of production and circulation developed at the expense of the workers, the real conditions of a new mode of production, abolishing the antagonistic form of the capitalist mode of production and thus creating the material basis of a new social life, a new type of society. 234\n\nCapital I, 1867\n\nLabor is, in the first place, a process in which both man and Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates and controls the material reactions between himself and Nature...by thus acting on the external world and changing it, he at the same time changes his own nature. He develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act in obedience to his sway. 170\n\nThe mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organization of the community, and the degree of historical development attained by the producers. (178)\n\n- It is not the articles made, but how they made, and by what instruments, that enables us to distinguish different economical epochs. 180\n\nWherever a part of society possesses a monopoly of the means of production, the worker, free or unfree, must add to the labor necessary for his own maintenance an extra quality of labor in order to produce the means of subsistence for the owner of the means of production. (1976:344 Penguin)\n\nCapital II, 1869\n\nThe last cause of all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as compared to the tendency of capitalist production to develop the productive forces in such a way that only the absolute power of consumption of the entire society would be their limit. 88\n\nTrade always has, to a greater or lesser degree, a solvent effect on the pre-existing organizations of production, which in all their various forms are principally oriented to use-value. But how far it leads to the dissolution of the old mode of production depends first and foremost on the solidity and inner articulation of this mode of production itself. And what comes out of this process of dissolution, i.e. what new mode of production arises in place of the old, does not depend on trade, but rather in the character of the old mode of production itself. (1981:449 Penguin)\n\nDrafts for The Civil War in France, 1871\n\nThe Commune does not do away with the class struggles, through which the working classes strive to the abolition of all classes and, therefore, of all class rule (because it does not represent a peculiar interest. It represents the liberation of 'labor', that is the fundamental and natural condition of individual and social life which only by usurpation, fraud and artificial contrivances can be shifted from the few upon the many), but it affords the rational medium I which that class struggle can run through its different phases in the most rational and human way. It could start violent reactions and as violent revolutions. It begins the emancipation of labor - its great work of the state parasites, by cutting away the springs which sacrifice a immense portion of the national produce to the feeding of the state monster on the one side, by doing, on the other, the real work of administration, local and national, for workingmen's wages. It begins therefore with an immense saving, with economical reform as well as political transformation. 194\n\ngreat strides may be made at once through the communal form of political organization and that the time has come to begin that movement for themselves and mankind. 235\n\nThe Alleged Splits in the International, 1872\n\nBy anarchy all socialists understand this: once the aim of the proletariate movement, the abolition of classes, is attained...the state power disappears and governmental functions are transformed into simple administrative functions. 220\n\nSpeech in Amsterdam, 1872\n\nin most of the countries on the Continent, it is force that must be the lever of our revolutions; it is to force that it will be necessary to appeal for a time in order to establish the reign of labor. 234\n\nMarx on Bakunin, 1875\n\nWhere the mass of the peasants are still owners of private property, where they even form a more or less important majority of the population, as they do in the states of the Western European continent, they have not yet disappeared and been replaced by agricultural wage laborers, as in England; in this cases the following situation arises: either the peasantry hinders every workers' revolution and causes it to fail, as it has done in France up till now; or the proletariate (for the landowning peasant does not belong to the proletariate and even when his own position causes him to belong to it, he does not think to belong to it) must as a government inaugurate measures which directly improve the situation of the peasant and which thus win him for the revolution; measures which in essence facilitate the transition from private to collective property in land so that the peasant himself is converted for economic reasons; the proletariate must not, however, come into open collision with peasantry by, for example, proclaiming the abolition of inheritance or the abolition of property; this latter is only possible where the capitalist landlord has expropriated the peasant and the real worker of the land is just as much a proletarian wage laborer as the city worker, and thus has directly the same interests. 235\n\nCritique of the Gotha Programme, 1875\n\nWhat we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birth marks of he old society from whose womb it emerges. 249\n\nCircular Letter, 1879\n\nFor almost forty years we have stressed the class struggle as the immediate driving riving power of history, and in particular the class struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariate as the great lever of the modern social revolution; it is, therefore, impossible for us to co-operate with people who wish to expunge this class struggle from the movement. 205\n\nFrom McLellan (1995)\n\nThus the way men produced their means of subsistence conditioned their whole social, political and intellectual life. At a certain stage in their evolution the forces of production would develop beyond the relations of production and these would act as a fetter. Such a stage inaugurated a period of social revolution. These productive forces had to develop to the fullest extent possible under the existing relations of production before the old social order would perish. (74)\n\nthe nature of economic crises...he [Marx] traced to the basic contradiction between the necessity of a capitalist economy to expand its production without taking into account the level of consumption that alone could make it feasible.\n\nIn all fields the common idea was that man had forfeited to someone or something what was essential to his nature - principally to be in control of his own activities, to be the initiator of the historical process. In the different forms of alienation some other entity obtained what was proper to man. P.108\n\nIt is man's nature, according to Marx in the Paris Manuscripts, to be constantly developing, in co-operation with other men, himself and the world about him. 110\n\nthe exploitation and inequality which were inherent in the relations of production were concealed by the appearance of free exchange in the sphere of circulation, concentration on which gave rise to the typically capitalist ideology of freedom, equality and so forth. (155)\n\nMarx thought that revolutions had occurred when one class had been able to identify its own interest with those of society as a whole. (182)\n\nClass, like the state or alienation, was a transitory phenomena portrayed to its fullest extent in capitalist society. (182)\n\nthe development of capitalist society was rapidly simplifying the situation by producing two and only two classes: bourgeoisie and proletariate. (183)\n\nThus the criterion for belonging to a class is one's position in the prevailing mode of production. (183)\n\nWhat he [Marx] did claim was that the gap in resources between those who owned the means of production and those who did not would widen. (183)\n\nThese groups [the petty bourgeoisie and the peasants] seem to render the neat division of the communist manifesto inapplicable, for these two groups obviously merge into bourgeoisie and the proletariate according to how many workers they employ or how much land they own. (184)\n\nMarx though that politically the peasants were a reactionary group and was unwilling to group them with the urban proletariate: the most recent peasant movements in Western Europe had had feudal or monarchist inclinations. (184)\n\nThus Marx's definition of class seems to vary greatly, not only with the development of his thought but even within the same period. Marx often uses the term, in common with the usage of his time, as a synonym for faction or group. (185)\n\nA class always viewed its own interests as opposed to those of other groups and had to be organized politically to fight for them. (185)\n\nThus Marx has many criteria for the application for the term 'class' and not all of them apply all the time. The two chief criteria are relationship to the prevailing mode of production and a group's consciousness of itself as a class with its attendant political organization. (186)\n\nMarx set out to show that it was an illusion to suppose that the state had a universal character capable of harmonizing the discordant elements of civil society and uniting them on a higher level. (207)\n\nThe form of government that Marx recommended, in contrast to Hegel, was one where there was no separation between civil society and the state and which directly corresponded to the 'essence of socialized man.' (207)\n\nThus Marx viewed the state, like religion, as a statement of man's ideal aims and also a compensation for their lack of realization. (208)\n\nIn the course of history each method of production gave rise to a typical political organization furthering the interests of the dominant class. (209)\n\nThis essence is communal creativity, the fact that man controls the process of his self creation and his relationship to nature, all of which is part of Marx's concept of work. In the future communist society everyone will be a worker: 'with labor emancipated every man becomes a working man, and productive labor ceases to be class attribute. 242\n\nFor according to Marx, communism sat on the shoulders of capitalism and you cannot arrive at communism unless you had gone through that particular purgatory. (253)\n\nThe collapse of Communism has taken with it three important doctrines. The first is that of dialectical materialism which offered a total interpretation of the world in a metaphysical, philosophical sense: laws governed everything from the change of quantity to quality in matter right up to the date of the next revolution. The all encompassing metaphysic based upon a crude materialistic interpretation of the world was never taken terribly seriously by most thinking people. But nevertheless it was something which - as rather more simplistic versions of religion have been - was widely propagated and presumably accepted by millions of people. 253\n\nany reform which relies either on moral rhetoric or on the law simply, or in the widening of political rights alone is unlikely to get down to the basis of the problem: the lack of economic power of a large proportion of individuals in society and the atomization and anomie that capitalism produces and reproduces. 254\n\nMen make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please, they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given, and transmitted from the past. (Marx, 139)\n\nthe dialectic \"includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the existing state of things at the same time also the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking-up; it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature no less than it momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary. (Wrote in 1872, 140)\n\nThe disappearance of the state as such is reserved for the time when 'all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly', and the exercise of 'political' power is no longer necessitated by economic pressure. 240\n\nEngels, F. (1877) Anti-Duhring: Selected Works\n\nBut when we see that the three classes of modern society, the feudal aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the proletariate, each have their special morality, we can only draw the one conclusion, that men, consciously or unconsciously, derive their moral ideas in the last resort from the practical relations on which there class position is based - from the economic relations in which they carry on production and exchange. 248\n\nWe maintain on the contrary tat all former moral theories are the product, in the lat analysis, of the economic stage which society had reached at that particular epoch. 249\n\nA really human morality which transcends class antagonism and their legacies in thought becomes possible only at a stage of society which has not only overcome class contradictions but has even forgotten them in practical life. 249\n\nBefore the original conception of relative equality could lead to the conclusion that men should have equal rights in the state and in society, before this conclusion could appear to be something even natural and self-evident, however, thousands of years had to pass and did pass. 250\n\nThe idea of equality, therefore, both in its bourgeois and its proletarian form, is itself a historical product, the creation of which required definite historical conditions which in turn themselves presuppose a long previous historical development. 254\n\nThe more the products of the commune assumed the commodity form, that is, the less they were produced for their producers' own use, and the more for the purpose of exchange, the more the primitive natural division of labor was replaced by exchange also within the commune, the more inequality developed in the property of the individual members of the commune, the more deeply was the ancient common ownership of the land undermined, and the more rapidly the commune developed towards its dissolution and transformation into a village of small peasants. 267\n\nall political power is originally based on an economic, social function, and increases in proportion as the members of society, through the dissolution of the primitive community, become transformed into private producers, and thus become more and more separated from the administrators of the general functions of society. 277\n\nThe materialist conception of history starts from the principle that production, and with production the exchange of its products, is the basis of every social order. 279\n\nAccumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital. 289\n\nThe expansion of the market cannot keep pace with the expansion of production. The collision becomes inevitable, and, as it can yield no solution so long as it does not burst the capitalist mode of production itself, it becomes periodic. 289\n\nthe mode of production rebels against the mode of exchange; the productive forces rebel against the mode of production, which they have outgrown. 290\n\nLenin, V. Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalsim\n\nIf it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism We should have to say that the imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism. 689\n\nImperialism is capitalism in the stage of development in which the domination of monopolies and finance capital has taken shape; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world by the international trusts has begun, and in which the partition of all the territory of the earth by the greatest capitalist countries has been completed. 690\n\n[Kautsky] \"Imperialism is a product of highly developed industrial capitalism. It consists in the striving of every industrialist capitalist nation to bring under its control and to annex larger and larger agrarian regions, irrespective of what nations inhabit them.\" 691\n\nthe most deep rooted economic foundation of imperialism is monopoly. 700\n\n[Sartorius von Waltershausen] The creditor is more firmly tied to the debtor than the seller is to the buyer. 702\n\nBerlin, I. (1963) Karl Marx: His Life and Environment, New York: Time.\n\nHe [Marx] concluded that the history of society is the history of man seeking to attain to mastery of himself and of the external world by means of his creative labor. 6\n\nprogress is constituted by the succession of victories of one class over the other, and that man alone is rational who identifies himself with the progressive class in his society, either, if need be, by deliberately abandoning his past and allying himself with it, or if history has already placed him there, by consciously recognizing his situation and acting in the light of it. 6-7\n\nMoral, political, economic, conceptions and ideals alter with the social conditions from which they spring: to regard any one of them as universal and immutable is tantamount to believing that the order to which they belong, in this case the bourgeois order - is eternal. 8\n\nIf the class war is real, these interests are totally incompatible. 8\n\nThe manifestoes, professions of faith and programmes of action to which he appended his name, contains scarcely any references to moral progress, eternal justice, the equality of man, the rights or individuals or nations, the liberty of conscience, the fight for civilization, and other such phrases which were the stock and trade (and had once genuinely embodied ideals) of the democratic movements of his time; he looked upon these as so much worthless cant, indicating confusion of thought and ineffectiveness in action. 8-9\n\nTo denounce the process itself - the painful conflicts through and by which mankind struggles to achieve the full realization of its powers - was for Marx a sort of childish subjectivism, due to a morbid or shallow view of life, to some irrational prejudice in favor of this or that virtue or institution; it revealed attachment to the old world and was a symptom of incomplete emancipation from its values. 10\n\nFor while his realism, his empiricism, his attacks on abstract principles, his demand that every solution must be tested by its applicability to, and emergence out of, the actual situation, his contempt for compromise or gradualism as modes of escape from the necessity of drastic action, his belief that the masses are infinitely gullible and must at all costs be rescued, if necessary by force, from the knaves and fools who impose upon them, make him the precursor of the severer generation of practical revolutionaries of the next century: his rigid belief in the necessity of a complete break with the past, in the need for a wholly new social system as alone capable of saving the individual, who, if left to himself, will lose his way and perish, places him among the great authoritarian founders of new faiths, ruthless subverters and innovators who interpret the world in terms of a single, clear, passionately held principle, denouncing and destroying all that conflicts with it. 16\n\nHis intellectual system was a closed one, everything that entered was made to conform to a pre-established pattern, but it was grounded in observation and experience. 17\n\nhe did more than any other man to hasten the process, seeking to shorten the final agony which precedes the end. 18\n\nReason is always right. To every question there is only one true answer which with sufficient assiduity can be infallibly discovered, and this applies no less to questions of ethics or politics, of personal and social life, than to problems of physics and mathematics. Once found, the putting of a solution into practice is a matter of mere technical skill; but the traditional enemies of progress must first be removed, and men taught the importance of acting in all questions on the advice of disinterested scientific experts, whose knowledge is founded on reason and experience. Once this has been achieved, the path is clear to the millennium. 32-3\n\nMan is an object in nature, and the human soul, like the material substance, is swayed by no supernatural influences and posses no occult properties; its entire behavior can be adequately accounted for by means of ordinary verifiable physical hypotheses. 33\n\nin ordinary argument between two opponents, when, in the conflict between two partial falsehoods, new truth is discovered, itself only relative, itself assaulted by a counter-truth, the destruction of each by the other leading once more to a new level in which the antagonistic elements are transfigured into a new organic whole - a process which continues without end. He called this process dialectical. 46\n\nReform must spring from historically prepared soil; otherwise it is doomed to failure, condemned in advance by the forces of history which move in accordance with their own logic in their own time and at their own pace. 47\n\nWhereas competition evokes the worst and most brutal qualities in men, co-operation, besides promoting greater efficiency, moralizes and civilizes them by revealing the true end of communal life. 95\n\nThe only possible region in which to look for the principles of historical motion must be one that is open to scientific, that is empirical, inspection. 104\n\nThe status of an individual is determined by the part which he plays in the process of social production, and this in turn directly depends upon the character of the productive fores and their degree of development at any given stage. 105\n\nLabor transforms man's world, and himself too, in the course of its activity. 106\n\nImmense institutions, social, political, cultural, have been created to conserve their possessions in the hands of their present owners, not indeed by deliberate policy, but arising unconsciously out of the general attitude to life of those who govern a given society. 109\n\nAlienation occurs when the results of men's acts contradict their true purposes, when their official values, or the parts they play, misrepresent their real motives and needs and goals. This is the case, for example, when something that men have made to respond to human needs - say, a system of laws, or the rules of musical composition - acquires an independent status of its own, and is seen by men, not as something created by them to satisfy a common social want (which may have disappeared long ago), but as an objective law or institution, possessing eternal, impersonal authority in its own right, like the unalterable laws of Nature as conceived by scientists and ordinary men, like Gd for a believer. 114\n\nThe monopoly of the means of production held by a particular group of men, enables it to bind its will on the others and to force them to perform tasks alien to their needs. Thereby the unity of society is destroyed, and the lives of both classes become distorted. 115\n\nThe most oppressive of all, in Marx's demonology, is bourgeois economic science, which represents the movement of commodities or of money - indeed the process of production, consumption and distribution - as an impersonal process, similar to those of nature, an unalterable pattern of objective forces before which men can only bow, and which would be insane to resist. 116\n\nAlienation - the substitution of imaginary relations between, or worship of, inanimate objects or ideas for real relations between, or respect for, persons - will come to an end only when the final class- the proletariate - defeats the bourgeoisie. 117\n\nAll frustration, for Marx, is the product of alienation - the barriers and distortions that are created by the inevitable war of classes, and shut out this or that body of men from the harmonious co-operation with one another for which their nature craves. 118\n\nThe 'True Socialists' [Grun ad Hess] opposed the doctrine of the necessity of open class war on the ground that it blinded the workers to those rights and ideals for the sake of which they fought. Only as treating men as equal from the beginning, by dealing with them as human beings, that is, by renouncing force, and appealing to the sense of human solidarity, of equal justice and the generous sentiments of mankind, could a lasting harmony of interests be obtained. 120\n\nMarx this was the oldest, most familiar, most outworn of all the rationalist fallacies. He had met it in its worst form in the belief of his own father and his contemporaries that in the end reason and moral goodness were bound to triumph, a theory which was utterly discredited by events during the dark aftermath of the French Revolution. 121\n\nWhatever his opinions, a man's actions were inevitably guided by his real interests, by the requirements of his material situation; 122\n\nBut these others, who proclaim their solidarity with the workers, and assume that there always exists universal interests of mankind as such, common to all men - that men have interests independent of, or transcending their class affiliation - spread error and darkness in the proletarian camp itself, and thus weaken it for the coming struggle. 123\n\nTrue freedom is unattainable until society has been made rational, that is, has overcome the contradictions which breed illusions and distort the understanding of both masters and slaves. 129\n\nThe scientific study of historically evolving economic relations, and of their bearing on other aspects of the lives of communities and individuals, began with the application of Marxist canons of interpretation. 130\n\nthe Hegelian thesis, according to which the state, eve in its present condition, constitutes the most progressive and dynamic function of a collection of human beings assembled to lead a common life. 172\n\nMarx, as was made evident from his address to the Central Communist Committee in 1850, considered himself to have erred seriously in supposing that an alliance with the radical bourgeoisie was possible and even necessary before the final victory of the proletariate. 174.\n\nMen, emancipated at last from the tyranny both of nature and of their own ill-adapted and ill-controlled and therefore oppressive institutions, will begin to develop their capacities to the fullest extent. 203\n\nOllman, B. (1976) Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society, 2nd edn, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe theory of alienation is the intellectual construct in which Marx displays the devastating effect of capitalist production of human beings, on their physical and mental states and on their social processes of which they are a part. 131\n\nas a grand summing up, as Marx's conception of man in capitalist society, the theory of alienation can only be set out after its constituent elements have been accounted for. 131\n\nFor Marx, unalienation is the life man leads in communism. 132\n\nMarx refers to alienation as \"a mistake, a defect, which ought not to be\" (1844 Manuscripts, 170).\n\nall classes are considered alienated in the ways and to the degree that their members fall of the communist ideal. 132\n\nAlienated man...has been reduced to performing undifferentiated work on humanly undistinguishable objects among people deprived of their human variety and compassion. ... There is little that remains of his relations to his activity, product and fellows which enable us to grasp the peculiar qualities of his species. 134\n\nMarx presents alienation as partaking in four broad relations which are so distributed as to cover the whole of human existence. These are man's relations to his productive activity, his product, other men, and the species. 136\n\nWhat, then, constitutes the alienation of labor? Marx offers the following reply. \"First, the fact that labor is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mine.\" 136 (73-74).\n\n[Above] Marx is describing a state where the relations between activity and man's powers exist at a very low level of achievement. 137\n\n[In] Communist society...man's productive activities engages all his powers and creates ever widening opportunities for their fulfillment. In this manner, work in communism is an affirmation of human nature, while capitalist labor is its denial... 138\n\nthe relations of man's capitalist productive activity to man's species itself, to his body and mind, to his subjective feelings when doing labor, to his will to engage in labor, to the capitalist, too his own human and animal functions and to what productive activity will be like under communism equal alienated labor. 140\n\nman is alienated from his product because the activity which produced it is alienated. 141\n\n\"the product is but the summary of the activity, of production... In the estrangement of the object of labor is merely summarized the estrangement, the alienation, in the activity of labor itself. (73) 141.\n\n\"The worker put his life into the object\" (84) 141\n\nthrough alienated labor man not only engenders his relationship to the object and to the act of production as powers that are alien and hostile to him; he also engenders the relationship in which other men stand to his production and to his product, and the relationship in which he stands to these other men. Just as he begets his own product as a loss, as a product not belonging to him; so he begets the dominion of the one who does not produce over production and over the product. Just as he estranges himself from his own activity, so he confers the stranger activity which is not his own...a man alien to labor and standing outside it...the capitalist, or whatever one chooses to call the master of labor\" (79-80) 148\n\npulling in opposite directions, at the command of competing interests, their relations are necessarily antagonistic. 149\n\nSpecies...is the category of the possible denoting the particular those potentialities which mark man off from other living creatures. 150\n\ncommunist man and species man are identical. 150\n\n\"In tearing away from man the object of his production...estranged labor tears from him his species life, his real species objectivity, and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken from him\" (76) 150\n\nFor Marx, \"the productive life is the life of the species\" (75). Such activity is the chief means through which the individual expresses and develops his powers. 151\n\nFrom Marx's Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, in Fromm and Erich (eds.) (1963), Marx's Conception of Man, NY.\n\nHuaco, G. (1999) Marx and Sociobiology, Lanham, MD: University Press of America.\n\nPhilosophical propositions, such as metaphysical, ontological, or epistemological claims, are inherently unverifiable by any empirical evidence. 1\n\nMarx describes the capitalist market as \"a naturally evolved totality fragmenting into a circle of particularities.\" (1857-61, CW 29: 468)\n\nIntersubjectivity is a characteristic of primary group activities, and it is pointless to bemoan the fact that a society cannot be a community. 3\n\n\"The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question. Man must prove the truth of his thinking in practice.\" (1845-47, CW 5:3) 4\n\none of the meanings of the word 'materialism' in Marx, will be to remind us that theories can only be verified (or falsified) by empirical facts. 4\n\nhistory allows for short-term correlations but not for scientific laws which will always be valid. 8\n\n\"Society does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of the relationships and conditions in which these individuals stand to one another.\" (1857-61, CW, 28: 195) 9\n\nChanges in society produces changes in culture, and changes in culture produce changes in society. 9\n\n\"all science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things coincided.\" (Marx, 1894, Capital III: 797)\n\n\"Real Sciences \"seek to uncover the essence which lies hidden behind commonplace appearances, and which mostly contradicts the form of commonplace appearances (as for example, in the case of the movement of the sun about the earth).\" (1861, CW 34:86) 10\n\n\"the sole bond holding\" human \"together is natural necessity, need and private interests, the preservation of their property and their egoistic selves.\" (1843, CW 3:164) 14\n\n\"Only when the real, individual main re-absorbs in himself the abstract citizen, and as an individual human being has become a species-being in his everyday life, in his particular work, and in his particular situation only then will human emancipation have been accomplished.\"(1843-44, CW 3:168) 15\n\nIt is clear that Marx would like to transform societies back into communities, if only that were somehow possible. 15\n\nMarx argues that 'human nature' (or 'the essential nature of each individual\") is membership in what Marx calls 'the true community\" or \"the human community.\" However, in the world of urban industrial capitalism, a \"commercial society\" ruled by \"exchange and trade,\" people live in arrangements which are the opposite of a true community. 15\n\n\"To say that man is estranged from himself, therefore, is the same thing as saying that the society of this estranged man is a caricature of his real community, of his true species-life, that his activity therefore appears to him as a torment, his own creation as an alien power, his wealth as poverty, the essential bond linking him with other men as an unessential bond, and separation from his fellow men, on the other hand, as his true mode of existence.\" (1843, CW 3:217) 15\n\nboring work, social isolation, and poverty are understood as consequences of the loss of community. 16\n\nIt is not difficult to specify Marx's conception of a real community. It is one which \"the producer\" has \"immediate enjoyment\" of his product and uses it to satisfy \"personal needs.\" Furthermore, work \"is for him the enjoyment of his personality and the realization of his natural abilities and spiritual aims.\" (1843, CW, 3:220). 16\n\nIn a real community, \"the direct, natural, and necessary relation of a person to person is the relation of man to woman.\" This is the \"natural species-relationship.\" (1843, CW 3:295). Therefore, a real community is a warm primary group of significant others. 16\n\nIn what kind of social world would it be the case that all people are happy in their work and use it to develop their \"physical and mental energy\"? In what kind of social arrangement would work satisfy the intrinsic human needs of workers and be something other than a means to earn a living? These are the features of Marx's lost ideal community. 18\n\nMarx says that \"estranged labor turns...Man's species-being into a being alien to him, into a means for his individual existence.\" (1843, CW, 3:277).\n\nsince community (or species-being) is the \"essential being\" (1843, CW 3:276) or core of human nature, it follows that human living in society are alienated from the core of their human nature. 19\n\nWhat is peculiar about Marx's Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, is that in this work, the two great themes of loss of community and economic exploitation come together for the first time. 19\n\nBehind all this [desire for community] is a probable source in Freud's insight about a universal human desire to return to the womb. 20\n\nfamilies share a common gene pool. The caring and generous behavior is a real community is probably an unconscious defense of a shared gene pool. 21\n\nWhile the French centralized and, therefore, abbreviated the reign of terrorism, the Spaniards, true to their traditions, decentralized and, consequently, procrastinated it. Conforming to Spanish tradition, the revolutionary party was not likely to prove victorious by subverting the throne (Marx and Engels, 1854-55, CW 13:659) 147\n\nTechnology is described by Marx as \"machines, locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs the objectified power of knowledge.\" Above 29:92 25\n\n\"Science, which compels the inanimate members of the machinery, by means of their design, to operate purposefully as an automaton, does not exist in the worker's consciousness, but acts upon him through the machine as an alien force, as the force of the machine itself.\" (M&E, 1857-61, CW 29:83) 25\n\nAs of 1850, Marx did not mean abolition; all he meant was reduction of state power. 28\n\nthe government is the \"social organ for the maintenance of social order.\" (M&E 1874-83, CW 24:82 28\n\nWhy does Marx want to get rid of what he calls the \"state parasite\"? Because it had grown \"independent of society.\" Marx wants to replace this state parasite with a decentralized and idealized version of representative democracy. This is very clear in his description and praise of the Paris Commune in 1871. 30\n\nFirst, in 1871, Marx still believed in an egalitarian economic order. Second, Marx believed in representative democracy. He would have no use for versions of participatory democracy or direct democracy which had been advocated by anarchist thinkers. 31\n\nThe level of development of the forces causally explains the character of the ownership relations. 33\n\nSlave ownership in the Roman Empire discouraged labor-saving devices, and thus held back an increase in technology. 35\n\n\"the characteristic 'figure' of a crisis in a mode of production is not one in which vigorous (economic) forces of production burst triumphantly through retrograde (social) relations of production, and promptly establish a higher productivity and society on their ruins. On the contrary, the forces of production typically tend to stall and recede within the existing relations of production; these then must themselves first be radically changed and reordered before new productive forces can be created. (Perry Anderson, 1974:204) 37\n\n\"Since we may assume that a nomadic way of life, is the first form of existence; that the tribe does not settle on a certain site but that it grazes off what it finds there and moves on--men are not settled by nature (unless perhaps in such an exceptionally fertile region that they settle on a tree like the monkeys; otherwise they are roaming like wild animals).\" (M, 1857-61, CW 28:400) 42\n\nAnthropologists tell us that the hunters and gatherers worked an average of three hours a day, and had a diet rich in proteins, fruits, and vegetables. 42\n\nIf the entire working day (available working time) of a man (any man) were only sufficient to feed himself (and at best his family as well), then there would be no surplus labor, surplus value, and surplus produce. (1861-63, M, CW, 33:369) 43\n\nWhy did nomadic hunter-gatherer society end and why did it change into traditional class society? Marx points to two factors: 1) \"the increase in population\" and 2) \"the impact of war and conquest.\" (M, 1857-61, CW, 28:410) 43\n\n\"A conquering people divides the land among the conquerors and in this way imposes a definite mode of distribution and form of landed property, thus determining production. Or it turns the conquered into slaves, thus making slave labor the basis of production.\" (M, 1857-61, CW, 28:33). 44\n\nCapitalist industrial class society raises the standard of living for most classes and groups, and doubles the average life span (from 35 years to 70 plus). The producers are neither peasant farmers, nor serfs, nor slaves, but largely urban \"formally free\" workers who own their physical and mental labor power (M, 1861-64, CW, 34:95, 100, 118). 47\n\nindustrial capitalism creates the first society that becomes an enemy of nature. \"For the first time nature becomes an object for men, nothing more than an object of utility. It ceases to be acknowledged as a power in itself\" (M, 1857-51, 28:337); and \"The view of nature attained under the dominion of private property and money is a real contempt for and practical debasement of nature.\" (M&E, 1843-44, 3:172) 48\n\nOn September 8, 1872, Marx gave a speech in Amsterdam in which he said that in the United States and Britain change toward socialism will be peaceful and not by violent revolution (M&E, 1871-1874, 23:255). 49\n\nThis clearly indicates that Marx's final view was that industrial capitalism that is also a representative democracy will change by peaceful means. In his day, capitalist industrialism and representative democracy were present only in Britain and the United States. Today, they exist throughout the entire urban-industrial world. So, if violent revolution is not on the historical agenda for the urban-industrial sector of the planet, what does the future hold? The answer is automation. 49\n\n\"In England, strikes have regularly given rise to the invention and application of new machines. Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labor. The self-acting mule, the greatest invention of modern industry, put out of action the spinners who were in revolt. If combinations and strikes had no other effect than that of making the efforts of mechanical genius react against them, they would still exercise an immense influence on the development of industry.\" (M&E, 1845-1848, 6:207) 49-50\n\n\"A development of productive power which reduced the absolute number of workers, i.e. in fact enabled the whole nation to execute its total production in a smaller period of time, would bring about revolution, because it would demonetize the majority of the population.\" (M, 1861-63, 33: 142) 50\n\nThe survival of capitalist industrial society depends of effective consumer demand from within the industrial world. 51\n\n\"a principle may appear \"sound\" on the part of the economist and the classes of which he is the theoretical mouthpiece, and may, nevertheless, not only prove contrary to all the laws of human conscience, but like a cancer, eat into the very vitals of the whole generation.\" (M&E, 1858-60, 16:191) 51\n\n\"Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesmen, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.\" (Nietzsche, 1984, [1878]: 171, para. 283) 52\n\nBasically, Marx wanted public or \"common ownership of the means of production\" (M&E, 1874-83, 24:85), and he wanted a planned economy or a \"society organized as a conscious and planned association\" (Marx, 1962, [1895] Capital III: 645). 56\n\nUnfortunately the idealized original human community is long gone and never to return. 56\n\n\"The development of culture and of industry in general has ever evinced itself in such energetic destruction of forests that everything done by it conversely, for their preservation and restoration appears infinitesimal.\" (M, [1893] 1961, Capital II: 244) 59\n\n\"Even a whole society, a nation, or even all simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not the owners of the globe. They are only its possessors, its usufructuaries, and they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition.\" (M, 1962 [1895] Capital III: 757) 59\n\nThe short-term real threats of world-wide overpopulation seem to be (a) an increase in crowding, poverty, and a lowering of the quality of life in both the industrial and non-industrial areas; (b) the extermination of the rain forests and plant life; (c) the extermination of non-human animals. 60\n\nIf all human, worldwide, were limited to having a maximum of two biological children per couple, then world population would return eventually to a level, where it could be stabilized by having allowable births match the number of deaths. This would provide a margin for the survival of other life forms. 61\n\nThe immediate problem facing urban-industrial societies are such as to require powerful and effective central governments. In this context, Marx's hope and expectation that the political state and political domination would disappear sometime in the future, can be seen to be little more than an anarchist illusion. 61\n\nWhat remains of the rain forests can only be saved by some rather extreme and drastic measures: the countries of the industrial societies would probably have to engage in concerted military intervention to place entire areas of the planet off-limits to further human encroachment. 62\n\n\"Without the great alternative phases of dullness, prosperity, overexcitement, crises and distress, which modern industry traverses in periodically recurring cycles, with the up and down of wages resulting from them, as with the constant warfare between masters and men closely corresponding with those variations in wages and profits, the working classes of Britain, and of all Europe, would be heart-broken, a weak minded, a worn out, unresisting mass, whose self-emancipation would prove as impossible as that of the slaves of Ancient Greece and Rome.\" (M&E, 1853-4, 12:169) 67\n\nreducing the economic matrix (e.g., reducing the size of the underclass) would reduce that particular type of criminal activity. Specifically, Marx rejected Bakunin's romantic notion that a criminal brigand is some kind of revolutionary hero (M&E, 1871-4, 23:519-555) 68\n\nIf the cause of racism is conquest and colonialism, then it can only be undone by decolonization or economic restitution. However, in the long run, prospects are less sanguine. Given the predatory aggression of the human species, which Marx acknowledged (M, 1936 [1867] Capital I: 785), we will always have warfare. If we have warfare, we will have conquest and colonialism in one form or another. If we have conquest and colonialism, then the recurrent ideology of racism is likely to be with us for the foreseeable future. 69\n\n\"The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge. The top entrusts the understanding of detail to the lower levels, whilst the lower levels credit the top with the understanding of the general, and so all are mutually deceived.\" (M&E, 1843-4, 3:46-47) 70\n\nideology is \"mental production as expressed in the language of politics, laws, morality, religion, metaphysics, etc. of a people (M&E, 1845-7, 5:30, 36).\" 77\n\nThe fact that Marx starts his analysis of ideology with a focus on written and spoken language, tells us that for him, ideology is a trans-individual cultural group phenomenon. 77\n\nideology is more than an aspect, feature, or dimension of written and spoken language, ideology is an aspect of cultural discourse. 79\n\nSince scientific knowledge is one of the four forces (in the hidden structure of society), it follows that it is excluded from ideology. However, this only applies to pure scientific knowledge that can be expressed in mathematical notation. To the extent that scientific knowledge is expressed in verbal or written language, it too becomes part of the phenomenon of ideology. 78\n\nMarx is saying that Darwin organized his scientific data with the help of a vision of society, projected on to nature. 78\n\nIsomorphism may be defined as the deployment of a pattern of the phenomenal surface of society, and the replication or reflection of that same pattern in some sector of culture. 82\n\nfor Marx, ideology is a feature, aspect or dimension of written or spoken language. It includes non-linguistic forms such as painting or sculptor, but it excludes pure scientific knowledge. 83\n\nIt is the old illusion that changing existing relations depends only on the good will of people, and that existing relations are ideas. The alteration of consciousness divorced from actual relations -a pursuit followed by philosophers as a profession, i.e., as a business--is itself a product of existing relations and inseparable from them. 85\n\n\"The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice, self-contempt, abasement, submissiveness and humbleness, in short, all the qualities of the rabble.\" (M&E, 1845-8, 6:231)\n\nThe world of external reality remains independent, indifferent, and more powerful and longer-lasting than human beings. Marx would reject Nietzche's exaggerated linguistic determinism. Language does not create all of reality. Language does not create truth or subject and object. 86\n\nFor Marx, conceptual thought is internalized language: \"Ideas do not exist apart from language\" (M, 1857-61, 28:99). Marx is right for we do think in a language. However, his further claim that \"language is as old as consciousness\" (M&E, 1845-7, 5:43-44), is very doubtful. 87\n\n\"Ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him to remain unknown to him, otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process.\" (Feuer et. M&E, 1959:408)\n\nIf the thinker becomes conscious of what was previously unconscious, then his thinking is no longer \"an ideological process.\" 89\n\nThere are two main problems with the use of the term false consciousness as a definition of ideology. First, it shifts the locus on attention from the class or group to the individual. Second, it shifts attention from the external, objective world shared with others, to the internal, subjective, private, introspective domain whose contents cannot be inspected by others. This second problem is fatal. It contradicts Marx's definition of ideology as something in socially shared written or spoken language (and non-verbal forms of cultural discourse), and therefore as something external which can be examined by others. 90\n\nConservatives are critical of the social present and would like to return to the past. Liberals feel that the social present can be fixed with a few minor changes. Left-wing radicals are critical of the past and of the present and focused on the future. 94\n\nmen, developing their material production and their material intercourse alter, along with the actual world, also their thinking and the products of their thinking. It is not consciousness that determines life, but life that determines consciousness. (M&E, 1845-7, 5: 36-7). 97\n\nSince the Turks are an Islamic people, and predestination identifies Calvinist Christianity, Marx is saying that puritan Protestant Christianity favored capitalist industrialism, while Islam does not. 106\n\nLet us take, for example, the relation of Greek art, and that of Shakespeare, to the present time. We know that Greek mythology is not only the arsenal of Greek art, but also its basis (M&E, 1857-61, 28:47). 110\n\nThe beginning of a high culture seems to be made up mostly of believers, the end of civilization seems to be made up mostly of atheists. 111\n\nThe population abandons the countryside and crowds into gigantic world-cities where it demands bread and circuses (or welfare and entertaining spectacles). 117\n\nMarx wanted an industrial society without poverty and without economic exploitation. He believed that surplus transfer from producers to owners could be stopped if the market were replaced by economic planning and if capitalists were eliminated by replacing them with government ownership of the means of production. We know that these proposals are failures because they produce bureaucratic stagnation in the economy and give overwhelming power to the central government. Nevertheless, the possibility of creating an industrial society without poverty and without economic exploitation remains. We could retain a market and could retain competitive entrepreneurs but outlaw most economic inheritance. 122\n\nStop and reverse the human population explosion by setting limits on human reproduction. Set limits to economic inheritance and confine it to direct descendants. Use most of the recovered surplus to eliminate poverty. I call this democratic socialism. Someone else may call it a reformed and humanized capitalism. Both are right. 122\n\nMarx had a philosophy, but it was unoriginal and relatively unimportant. What is important is his testable social theory (i.e., his model of society and culture and associated hypotheses), and this is a work of a genius which towers above the competition in the last two centuries. 123\n\nBarbalet, J.
