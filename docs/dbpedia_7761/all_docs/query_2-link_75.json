        "meta_description": "Cet article expose le débat concernant le rapport entre le commerce, le progrès, la création de richesse et le bonheur depuis les dix-septième et dix-huitième siècles jusqu’à aujourd’hui. Il avance l’argument suivant : dès l’origine, les analystes étaient divisés entre les optimistes qui louaient les potentialités lucratives et humanitaires du commerce et de la société civile, et des voix plus critiques qui décriaient l’intérêt personnel inhérent au commerce, intérêt justifiant divers processus antisociaux et déshumanisants, qu’il s’agisse de la parcellisation des terres communes, de la colonisation, ou encore de l’exploitation liée au travail pouvant aller jusqu’à l’asservissement et au commerce d’êtres humains. Dès avant les années 1840, ces positions opposées avaient provoqué un débat entre les chantres et les détracteurs du capitalisme concernant sa relation avec le bien commun. À en juger par les menaces contemporaines que font peser sur nos vies l’urgence climatique et la pandémie de Covid-19, ce débat reste essentiel. Le présent article expose brièvement l’historiographie récente concernant l’histoire du capitalisme en lien avec la Jeune Amérique, ainsi que la relation que cette historiographie entretient avec Marx et sa critique de l’économie politique classique ; il pose la question de savoir dans quelle mesure la critique marxiste représente un contrepoint efficace à l’éthique capitaliste et à ses effets sociaux. Il se termine par une réflexion sur des travaux critiques récents ayant Marx pour objet et affirme qu’une relecture renouvelée et revigorée de Smith et de Marx pourrait, à l’avenir, ouvrir des perspectives de recherche fructueuses.",

        "text": "3In the following, we revisit the significance of these claims regarding the connection between commerce, improvement, wealth creation, and public happiness which, in our own time, have been reduced to a short-hand reference to something we call “the economy.” Seventeenth and eighteenth-century commentators could not employ such a glib and presumptive reference, given their need to explain and justify the benefits of the new commerce to critics and doubters. This is one reason for the optimistic quality of texts that celebrate the profitable and humanitarian possibilities for the connection between commerce and civil society. Of course, there was (and there remains) another side to these glittering Enlightenment pronouncements which critics emphasized when they decried commerce as “the mark of selfishness” whose “all-enslaving power” it set “upon a shining ore, and called it gold” (Shelley 61-62).Here, the concern was with the anti-social and often dehumanizing processes – of enclosure, colonization, and the binding, impoverishing, and enslaving of labor – that generated the value necessary to build, improve, and edify civil society. Within a few short decades these contrasting positions had generated a debate between advocates and critics of capitalism and its relationship to the public good. This debate is as relevant today as it was in the 1840s – perhaps more so, given the contemporary and existential threats of climate emergency and the global pandemic. In light of this, the paper briefly considers recent historiography concerning the history of capitalism and early America, and its relationship to Marx and his critique of Smith and classical political economy, and the extent to which it offers an effective challenge to capitalist ethics and their social effects. It finishes with a discussion of recent, critical work on Marx and proposes that renewing and reimagining our engagement with Smith and Marx might lead to new and productive research directions in the future.\n\n*\n\n4The connections drawn between commerce, wealth creation, and public happiness were foundational to the eighteenth-century justification of the social acceptability of self-interested pursuits, which had been previously identified with unchristian and amoral greed frequently leading to political corruption, civil strife, and even tyranny (Pocock). Classic and recent scholarly studies trace a crucial transition, whereby self-interest was reconceived as not only a legitimate means to socially-beneficial ends, but also the most effective likely limit on rapacious behavior, given the advantages offered to all individuals with access to free trade, the division of labor, and specialization (Hirschman; Yamamoto). The freedom to pursue one’s interests was also a powerful element in arguments on behalf of individual liberty, the settling of civil and religious societies, and their positive effects. Thus in his Theopolis Americana (1709) Cotton Mather justified Boston’s participation in the West Indies slave trade as legitimate, if it enhanced its status as a godly city playing Bees (1714) scandalized readers by proposing that what were conventionally regarded as vices – pride its part in English Protestantism’s struggle against Catholicism; in London, Bernard Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees, luxury, avarice – could be the source of wealth and public benefits in a commercial society (Peterson 238-45; Wootton, chap. 3-7). In this way commerce and self-interested activities designated as “economic” were rationalized as providing a foundation for individual rights and liberty and the provision for the public good. Commercial and civil societies generated the time and value necessary to invest in liberal and humanitarian pursuits, providing for individual excellence in arts and letters, public education, and even the abolition of slavery. We find these associations between commerce and public happiness in essays by Daniel Defoe and David Hume through Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments (1756) and The Wealth of Nations (1776) and the American Declaration of Independence concerning a subject’s inalienable right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\n5Many historians have been understandably skeptical regarding these grandiose statements of Enlightenment economic ideals, asking the obvious question – whose happiness? The wealth “created” by this burgeoning commercial and civil society was extracted from the bodies of African and Native American enslaved people, bound servants, urban and rural laborers and domestic workers; all were regulated by eye-watering judicial and extra-judicial violence visited on those who stepped out of line. Even as genteel essayists waxed lyrically on the connections between trade, civility, and happiness, they participated in (often, literally, as investors) and justified the accumulation of profits at home and abroad, enclosing land, disciplining labor and domestic production, invading and enslaving African and Indigenous peoples. As global investment, commerce, and expropriation grew, more and more wealth became concentrated in certain geographies and demographics. The prevailing wisdom reconfigured earlier ethno-religious and birthright rationalizations for social distinctions and inequalities around new “scientific” racial and gendered distinctions and class differentiation between lower and middling sorts and the elite. Intellectual and political traditions, of republicanism and natural rights, generated a language of liberalism which stressed the legal equality of consenting subjects, adding a veneer of contractualism and agency to the exploitation of the many by the few; by the late eighteenth century, these same political languages – stressing equality, consent, and justice – provided for the rise of domestic and colonial opposition and the determination of many to resist subjection class and racial injustice sponsoring new forms of solidarity – such as consciousness of one’s class identity – and widespread struggles for self-determination. By the 1830s and 40s what Hume and Smith had known as commercial society was increasingly called capitalism; the word had been around since the seventeenth-century, but emerged in the mid nineteenth century as a term of art used to differentiate between earlier social and economic systems and contemporary mode of production and exchange (Kocka and Van der Linden 1-3). In the 1840s a young philosophy graduate and radical journalist, Karl Marx, was one of many who grappled with the emerging system’s increasingly socially-conflicted, anti-humanist, and self-destructive impulses – leading to characterizations very much at odds with the earlier imagined symbiosis between commerce, civility, and happiness.\n\n7Late in 2019, when thinking about this article, it felt like a propitious time for early modern historians to think again about debates we have become used to associating with Marx and Smith, and the connections between commerce, capitalism, and the common good. In 2007-8 the catastrophic collapse of years of credit-fueled state and consumer spending, which had obscured long-term decline in productivity and wages, renewed interest in the history of capitalism. Since then, the international economy has increasingly taken on characteristics of early modern seventeenth and eighteenth-century norms and practices: a supranational, quasi-imperial order characterized by mercantilist protectionism and trade wars, for example between the USA and China; the precarious rather than proletarian character of the “gig economy” labor force, ranging from university teachers to taxi drivers; a rentier approach to capital accumulation, with ruling elites sweating public service assets – education, healthcare, utilities – rather than investing in innovation and manufacturing; the proliferation of new forms of money – a cashless and bitcoin – and the machinations of the bust-and-then-bailed-out financial system, which most laypeople regard with the same kind of head-scratching bemusement as our eighteenth-century subjects greeted the speculation that led to the South Sea Bubble collapse (Varoufakis; Hoppit).\n\n9As I began to revise my remarks early in 2020, the political and economic ideological shibboleths which were declared utterly non-negotiable as recently as the UK general election of December 2019 were being swept aside by a global pandemic, the like of which the world has not witnessed since the 1919-20 Spanish Flu infected an estimated one-third of the global population and killed as many as 50 million. For obvious reasons, mainstream politicians and commentators are keen to portray the pandemic as a natural disaster for which no one could have prepared. They are endeavoring to obscure their initially weak and in some cases incompetent response, and readying their publics to accept infection estimates of 20-60% of the population and mortality rates of roughly one half to one per cent of a global population of 7.8 billion, or 40-80 million. For a figure that large, one has to go back to the Black Death, which claimed an estimated 75-200 million lives (in a much smaller global population) in the fourteenth century; an event and century, according to some, that initiated the social and economic processes that, in time, birthed our contemporary commercial and capitalist societies.\n\n*\n\n13A second critical response, from the perspective of traditional economic history challenges the NHC’s chronological focus and its implied under estimation of earlier conjunctions of slavery and capitalism, understood within a liberal narrative of commercialization (Burnard chap. 9). Long before the production of cotton in the Antebellum South, enslaved people cultivated sugar and other New World commodities that generated vast revenues providing European states with comparative advantages. The trade in New World commodities stimulated the rise of mercantilism and early political economists’ attempts to grapple with the dynamics of wealth creation beyond accumulating bullion. This understanding, coupled with perennial European geopolitical rivalry, drove forward the formation of unified and more bureaucratic European states and their increasingly ambitious imperial projects. These ambitions depended on increasing militarism and violence, as stressed by the NHC and others, but they also inspired and relied upon a plethora of organizational and technological innovations – in banking, accounting, fiscal and monetary policy based on secure and certain sovereign credit, and the fostering of pro-manufacturing and free trade ideologies. They also depended on the rise of consumption and growing middling class whom, some have argued, elected to work harder in order to take advantage of greater variety of goods and services available, in the process engaging in self-fashioning that anticipated the expression of personal agency and choice inherent in the development of liberal politics (De Vries, The Industrious Revolution).\n\n*\n\n18What is needed is a useable point of entry into Marx and the Marxist tradition, such as that provided by Gareth Stedman Jones’s biography which provides a masterful contextualization of Marx and his writings. This approach encourages us to grapple with the canonical texts as products of particular places and times, rather than one, massive and indigestible Marxist mash-up. As his title indicates, Stedman Jones is skeptical about Marx’s intellectual project and published legacy, regarding him as a mostly unoriginal thinker who combined two strands of eighteenth-century political and economic thought: the positive assessment of commercial society’s beneficent effects, which we glossed above; and an anti-commercial tradition, ranging from conservatives anxious about the corrupting effects of new, speculative wealth to radical critics of the antisocial effects of unbridled commerce from Rousseau to the Jacobins. According to Stedman Jones, Marx’s great insight, arrived at by the time of the publication of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848), was that although labor creates the world and its wealth, it is doomed never to enjoy a plentiful future under capitalism, because of the way in which “free” and voluntary exchange concentrates surplus in the hands of a few. For the next twenty years Marx tried and failed to establish a “pathway to communism,” in large part because he was unable to conceive of a future without some form of the market, which even his stadial conception of historical change confirmed had been present in all preceding eras. Thus the first volume of Capital (1867) became a vast introduction to a larger but abandoned work. Marx owes his longevity, as has long been acknowledged, to Friedrich Engels’ decision to edit and publish his extant writings following Marx’s death in 1883. Engels established the Marxist tradition, within which generations of readers, theorists, and revolutionaries have endeavored to master the master’s unfinished but, disciples believe, comprehensive and devastating critique of capitalism.\n\n21In a related study, The Moral Economists, Tim Rogan examines twentieth-century historiographical critiques of capitalism that responded to this Victorian conceptualization which produced a global economic collapse and two world wars in the first half of the twentieth century and which is arguably with us still. These “moral economists” looked beyond the manifest inequalities in wealth and critiqued utilitarian capitalist ethics, while steering clear of socialist alternatives which, some believed, led to illiberal authoritarianism. Their histories presented earlier histories of everyday life and ethics which came into acute tension with novel commercial imperatives leading to a transition to capitalism. Thus R.H.Tawney celebrated early modern community and guild solidarity, local customs, the deference to elders, and a collective religious faith that sustained the “supreme value of every human personality” (Rogan, 44-50). This ethical framework was sundered when the Reformation transformed religion into a private matter, allowing believers to imagine salvation in isolation, thereby legitimizing the individualism and self-centeredness that led to insatiable commercial greed, miserable working conditions, and economic boom and bust of the early twentieth-century. Karl Polanyi broadened the base of Tawney’s critique, supplanting Christian social ethics with humanist sociology of young Marx (whose influential early writings were first published in German in 1932) and describing the advent of market financial relationships based on a, mostly nineteenth-century, Great Transformation; Polanyi also partly inspired E.P. Thompson’s influential work on custom and the moral economy of the English crowd which inspired the new social history in the 1960s-70s (Tawney; Polanyi; Thompson Customs in Common). The emphasis shifted from study to study, but what was common to all was their effort to recover an earlier, shared human personality that was more layered and nuanced than allowed for in the utilitarian account of the progress of an ahistorical homo economicus in the seemingly ineluctable rise of capitalism and modern market exchange relationships.\n\n25A return to engagement with Marx might also prompt a shift in focus away from the recent enthusiasm for narrative histories of particular subjects or groups and their agency and towards the structures which informed and mediated their conditions and experiences. Two potentially areas here are histories of money and of notions of value. Marx is usually read as more or less accepting the classical political economy idea of money as a special commodity that serves primarily as a medium of exchange: in this conception money facilitates without otherwise conditioning the character of trade. Recent studies have challenged this classical/Marxist view of money, offering a social history of money, its changing forms, and historical influence. Thus in 1500 Europe’s monetary landscape looked pretty much as it had for the preceding three centuries, and the revival of money exchanges after a long period of limited market activity following the collapse of the Roman Empire. Within the next two hundred years, however, the form and management of money was transformed – not least by the invention of paper currencies and the establishment of central banks and military-fiscal states – in the service of waging war and defending overseas interests, not least the slave trade. This introduced a new kind of unchecked finance capitalism which prioritized greed and violence over compassion noted by Tawney long ago and in one variant or another with us still (Arrighi, The Long Twentieth Century; Baucom; Desan; McNally)."
