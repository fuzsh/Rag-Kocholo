        "text": "The main line of the venerable JRPG series can be an endless labyrinth of formats, hardware and remakes. Here’s a guide to making the most of your playtime and purchasing power.\n\nUPDATE 2020/02/04: New year, new look reassessments!\n\nNotes: “every” denotes mainline games. There aren’t enough pixels on the internet to try to go down the sequel/spin-off rabbit hole. Also, there’s a heavy bias toward consoles here, both because I prefer consoles, and because Final Fantasy is much more synonymous with consoles than PC.\n\nFINAL FANTASY\n\nThe granddaddy of them all, this 1987 last-ditch effort from Squaresoft took the world by storm and its progeny number in the dozens. First released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, it and the oft-forgotten second installment are often bundled together. There was a PlayStation re-release (a two-pack dubbed Final Fantasy Origins) that cleaned up some bugs and translation errors, but the definitive version is the 20th anniversary re-release that first saw the light of day on Sony’s sadly forgotten first handheld, the PlayStation Portable (PSP). I’d say that one, with its higher resolution and gorgeous redrawn sprites, takes the crown, but it’s inexplicably never been released digitally in North America for the Vita (despite other regions having it), so here in the States, it’s stuck on a defunct system. They’re not quite as good, trading buttons and a D-pad for slightly fiddly software touch controls, but given that few people probably have a PSP sitting around, for ease of access the iOS/Android ports of the PSP version are probably your best bet. If you want to really go old-school, try to find yourself a NES Classic Mini; it’s available in its OG form there. I have no nostalgia goggles regarding Final Fantasy I, so I can say booting it up in the NES Classic Mini and playing that original, unaltered version is an exercise in masochism in this, the year 2020. If you’re gunning for a punishing challenge, it’s the one you want, but…know what you’re getting yourself into. Fun fact: There are actually semi-canonical names for the characters in Final Fantasy! Originating from the Final Fantasy: Memory of Heroes novelization, they are: Zest the Warrior, Sauber the Thief, Floe the White Mage and Daewoo the Black Mage.\n\nFINAL FANTASY III\n\nWell…you’re not exactly spoiled for choice here. Final Fantasy III was, for the longest time, simply not available in English at all (once more, the SNES had a game titled “Final Fantasy III”, but that was actually Final Fantasy VI…again, more on that later). The original version of Luneth’s tale isn’t available outside of fan translation ROMs, but it was nicely remade in full polygonal 3D for the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP in 2006 (if you’re looking for a physical copy, you’ll only find the DS version, as the PSP disc never sold in North America, but it’s available for purchase on the PlayStation Network; conversely, if you’re looking for a digital copy for the DS, that’s unfortunately MIA on the Nintendo eShop). The nicer screen and ergonomics of the Vita hardware make that version the best, but if you don’t own a Vita, or don’t want to try to track down a used (or overpriced new) copy of the DS version, it also got an iOS/Android port. That version is outfitted with plain fonts and a rather garish touchscreen menu, but, uh, any port in a storm.\n\nFINAL FANTASY IV\n\nOne of my favorites in the series, Final Fantasy IV also has the honor of having the most high-quality versions, and possibly the most confusing set of releases. First released in North America as “Final Fantasy II” (not to be confused with the actual Final Fantasy II) for the Super Nintendo, it got a phenomenal high definition graphical update in 2011 on the Sony PSP, titled Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection, featuring gorgeous redrawn 2D sprites and the addition of Final Fantasy IV: Interlude and Final Fantasy IV: The After Years. Neither are essential but they’re nice to have. Unfortunately, that version hasn’t been seen outside of the PSP, though if you have one, you can purchase the Complete Collection digitally on the PSN for PSP/Vita. For a different experience, the game was fully remade in polygonal 3D like Final Fantasy III, and released on the Nintendo DS. It adds some (OK…ish) voice acting too, if that floats your boat, and it saw a number of changes and additions that upped the difficulty level of the game. The two games feel very different, but I think you’ll mostly want to pick based on your preferred art style; I’ve seen people swear that the DS remake looks immeasurably superior to the 2D PSP version, and others (like, me, honestly) that feel the exact opposite. That DS version is the one that was ported to iOS and Android, so if you want to go that route, it’s an option. But if you’ve got a PSP or Vita and want to play FFIV, I definitely recommend opting for that.\n\nFINAL FANTASY V\n\nThe epic tale of Bartz (or Batz, or…Butz), Final Fantasy V was released for the Super Famicom (Japan’s version of the SNES), but it never made its way over to English consoles until it got a port over to the PlayStation as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology set along with Final Fantasy VI. It then appeared on the Game Boy Advance, like I, II, IV and VI, with unfortunately dessicated music due to the GBA’s lackluster sound hardware. Thne, in 2013, FFV was given an overhaul and ported to iOS/Android, featuring what Square Enix called “new high-resolution graphics” and what fans derided as “Vaseline-smeared sprites”. To say it wasn’t well-received is an understatement (though it was nothing compared with our next entry), so play that version if you absolutely must, but if you can, opt for the Game Boy Advance version, despite its sound chip’s shortcomings. Side note: like Final Fantasy VI, the PSOne Classic version suffers from inexplicably lengthy loading times when transitioning to battle, opening menus, etc., and while it’s not a deal-breaker, it is definitely noticeable. I have been told that this was fixed for the European release, which is another reason to snag a Vita and register an EU account.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VI\n\nAaaaand here’s where the definitive version choices start to get…messy. Originally released on the Super Nintendo as “Final Fantasy III”, FFVI, like IV before it, has gone on to arguably be considered the best of the entire series, and possibly the best JRPG ever made (though Chrono Trigger, a sort-of cousin to the Final Fantasy series, also lays claim to that crown). Its releases have not reflected that prominence, however. The game’s original translation was quirky but truncated (due to cartridge space restrictions). This was improved upon in the next version (a port for the PlayStation, as part of that aforementioned Final Fantasy Anthology), but like FFV, it introduced massive slowdown when battling or accessing menus. The following version (for the Game Boy Advance) fixed that, and used the improved translation, but ruined the beautiful score by series mainstay Nobuo Uematsu, due to the GBA’s music chip not being up to the task. Then it was released for iOS and Android, but the smeary sprite style that debuted in the mobile port of FFV returned. Ugly sprites, poor UI design and bland font choices do not befit one of the greatest games ever made (to add insult to injury, the Steam port is just a port of the mobile version, retaining its chunky, hideous touchscreen UI). Until FFVI gets the Final Fantasy IV: Complete Collection treatment it so richly deserves, the Game Boy Advance version, Final Fantasy VI Advance, is probably the most definitive for right now. If you’re playing a ROM, there are easily-available patches to restore the music to its former glory, and Square Enix graciously dropped every Final Fantasy soundtrack onto Spotify, Apple Music, et al. a while back, so you can hear it as it’s meant to be heard. Barring that, the PSOne version on PSN is…fine, I guess. You’ll just be constantly wondering why it takes a SNES game so long to load a single damn menu screen.\n\nUpdate 2018/04/15: I am reevaluating my distaste for the redrawn sprites of Final Fantasy IV. The more I live with them, the more I realize just how close they are to the original artwork. I personally still prefer the original sprites from the SNES version, but the overall aesthetic presentation is much more of a mixed bag than the complete disaster it initially seemed to me. The UI design and font choice are still disgracefully bland, and there are some slight changes I’d like to see to the sprites that would, I think, greatly improve them (like drawing them from a slight 3/4 perspective, like the ones from the 20th anniversary versions of FF and FFII, adding some darker lines inside the sprite rather than only having a bold exterior outline). But the portrait art is absolutely lovely (though there need to be more expressions, rather than just one stock picture per character), and the backgrounds and effects do look gorgeous. Basically, the redone art in the game is all phenomenal…except for the actual characters, which unfortunately is a major sticking point. I’d probably still recommend the GBA version (patched to restore the music), but the mobile version is a fairly decent alternative, particularly if you’ve got a controller and a tablet with a nice large screen.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII\n\nThe series leapt into the third dimension (and CGI cinematics) with its seventh installment, and blew a lot of young minds in the process. Nowadays, its blocky, primitive polygons don’t hold up, quite frankly, but the ubiquity of the game makes it the closest thing this anthology series has to a poster child. Think of it as the Tom Baker of the Final Fantasy franchise. Owing to the massive popularity of Cloud Strife, Sephiroth, Aerith and the gang, it’s been re-released frequently but Square’s never really messed with it (it’s getting a full and complete ground-up remake, arriving, at least in part, on April 10th, 2020, as it’s being split up over multiple releases). The original version is available on PSN for PS3 and PSP/Vita, but it also got a PS4, Switch, Xbox One and Steam version that added a few tweaks, like the ability to turn off random encounters, and rendered the whole thing in HD with upscaled textures (though not more detailed character models). If you want to play it now, the PS4 version is the definitive version of the original game, or you can pick it up for Switch to gain portability, or you can try to wait for the remake to come out.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XII\n\nThis one came out of left field. For a generation whose previous experience was X and X-2, criticism for XII mostly centered on the sense that the game “played itself,” with its strategic character setups and battle scheme that only controlled one character at a time. I’ll be honest, I overlooked it when it first came out, as my wife, who adored X, didn’t take to it, and from the series’ return to its more common gameplay style in the next installment, I take it she wasn’t the only one. However, in 2017 it was remastered and rereleased for the PlayStation 4 as Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age as part of the series’ 30th anniversary celebration. I decided to give its remaster a go, and absolutely fell in love with it. It doesn’t hurt that it takes place in Ivalice, my favorite FF world (other games set in various versions of Ivalice include Vagrant Story and the Final Fantasy Tactics series). Also, they fixed Vaan’s creepy abs in the remake, so…that’s definitely a plus. This remixed version got a Switch, Xbox One and PS4 release, so take your pick. My recommendation here is a little less effusive for the Switch over the PS4, only because XII is the first time that games start to get pretty enough to really benefit from the PS4’s higher resolution. Personally, I prefer the Switch version’s tradeoff for portability, but you can’t go wrong with either the Switch or the PS4 versions.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIV\n\nI ignored Final Fantasy XIV upon initial release, owing to my distaste for the previous MMORPG installment, but recently my wife and I picked it up for the PlayStation 4 and are having a blast (and this is after dropping all MMORPGs years ago). The world of Eorzea (which seems to draw inspiration from Ivalice, and in fact features a version of Ivalice in one of its expansion packs) is stunning, and it runs like a dream on the console. What’s additionally shocking about it to me is just how much this open world and player-made character still feel like they truly are in a Final Fantasy tale. You can grab this one for PC or PS4, depending on your preference. I’ll say I never expected a console version of a MMORPG to be playable, much less fun, but the gameplay for XIV feels great with a controller (though you’ll need to tweak your HUD to clean it up some), so I personally recommend the PS4 version, but it’s down to your personal playstyle. More social types will want a keyboard, and if you don’t want to break your PC MMORPG gaming habits, that version’s fine too. This is a six-of-one situation, which makes the PS4 port all the more impressive.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XV\n\nAnd now, the final Fantasy (until the next one). The most recent installment of Final Fantasy features a four-man boy band and is yet another arm of the tedious Fabula Nova Crystallis sub-line of games. But it’s readily available for however you want to play it: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or Windows. A version containing DLC was just released, dubbed Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition. Grab the Royal Edition for the console of your choice, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, though again there’s a Windows port that seems to have been a swing and a miss. Both the PS4 and the Xbox One versions have their pros and cons, so they wind up evening out pretty well, though I give Sony’s console the edge because I’m old enough to feel like Final Fantasy being on a Microsoft console is just weird, like when Sonic the Hedgehog started popping up on Nintendo systems. There’s also a mobile port(!) with a simplified art style called Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition. YMMV on whether you think these character designs are cute or creepy. I think I lean toward creepy.\n\nUPDATE 2019/04/06: FFXV Pocket Edition was released a while back for the Nintendo Switch, so if you want to play that version and prefer real controls, that’s your best bet. There are persistent rumors that Square-Enix is trying to find a way to get the full version of FFXV onto the Switch. Fingers crossed."
