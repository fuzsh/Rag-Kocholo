Now with the PS Vita version set on the Jan. 5, 2015, the company behind the Final Fantasy craze is looking to expand on that nationwide impact with Final Fantasy Agito+. Square-Enix plans to release the game both physically and digitally for 3,800 yen. Currently, there hasn’t been any announcement in concerns with bringing the game to North America.\n\nYou can peep the fourth trailer for the game below."
