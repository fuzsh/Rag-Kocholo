        "text": "Fans who are looking to get a better look at the world of Orience are in luck, as Square-Enix unleashed a playable demo, street date and trailer for Final Fantasy Type-0 HD at the Tokyo Game Show today.\n\nJust like Final Fantasy Agito+, the title follows along with the Fabula Nova Crystallis sub series and is presented as an update to the original Final Fantasy Type-0 released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable three years ago.\n\nNow with an updated look and feel to the game, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD has it’s sights set for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles.\n\nSquare-Enix showed off a lot of this game at the show and the demo surely gives off the vibe that developers of the game have been working on mastering and finalizing the game’s uniqueness for the two home consoles. Players will handle several teams of threes in a Dynasty Quest style of infiltration and enemy battles.\n\nPlayers can switch between the three characters and will be able to chain attacks together using a combination of the face buttons. Players controlling the team will also have the power to summon eidolons on the fly, such as the fierce and hellish Ifrit.\n\nSquare-Enix also announced that North American consumers who preorder the game will get to play a special Final Fantasy XV demo titled Final Fantasy XV -Episode Duscae-. The demo is said to present the first few scenes and gameplay that is presented in the full game.\n\nOf course, where would all this FF goodness be without a release date? Final Fantasy Type-0 HD will release on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 17, 2015. Europe and Japan will be getting their due with the game on March 19 and 20 respectively.\n\nIf you haven’t seen what Type-0 is all about, be sure to check out the official Tokyo Game Show trailer for the game below."
