        "text": "Mainly because I see alot of people either not know what happened with the Project before and after or get bits confused.\n\nSo I just thought as someone whos been in alot of threads like this I thought I would try and sum up the history of Versus Development as best as I could.\n\nTo note this is mostly focused on Versus 13 up until Tabata took over and the reboot.\n\nLets start with the Beginning.\n\nFabula Nova Crystallis:\n\nFNC began back in 2004 as Square was beginning to work up development on the next Final Fantasy, FNC and its mythos was originally developed by Nojima over the course of a year and when he showed his idea to Square and its Developers they did really enjoy the idea bak in 2005.\n\nThe concept was to have a central Mythos a Grand Crystal Tales/Story but then each game in the series would be a Different interpretation/story using said mythos of Fabula Nova Crystallis.\n\nOver the year it was decided there would be three games set in said FNC.\n\n1. Final Fantasy 13 the first game in FNC\n\n2. Final Fantasy Agito 13, Type-0 original title back when it was announced before years later when it was re-revealed to have dropped the 13 from its name and be renamed Type-0 mainly because it didn't have much to do with 13.\n\nand finally\n\n3. Final Fantasy Versus 13\n\nVERSUS before 13's release\n\nAs with the title, Versus 13 was developed as in many ways the opposite or turn around of Final Fantasy 13.\n\n13's main color was White.\n\nVersus 13 was Black\n\n13 was set in a fantastical mystical futuristic world\n\nVersus 13 was set in a more Modern World (probably the last one since 8)\n\nMore so how the game was when it released, 13 was closed of and section based like 10\n\nVersus 13 was always designed and envisioned to be open in a way and try and replicate a real big open world.\n\nLook at things a bit more:\n\nLightning Bright Pink Hair, main color of clothes white with a futuristic gun sword\n\nNoctis jet black hair, wears all black and main signature weapon a sword with an engine on it with Ancient Royal Arms\n\n\"FFVersusXIII\" is a companion work to \"FFXIII\", but it's a contrast even if you compare the main characters.\n\nNomura: Is it because \"FFVersusXIII\" is dark overall or black (laughs)? It's true that the story is dark, but at first I thought it would be the shadow of \"FFXIII\", so I'm following that image. If \"FFXIII\" was light, \"FFVersusXIII\" was a shadow image. It's not particularly narratively paired, but I think it's too dangerous to call yourself \"FFXIII\" by itself. On the contrary, I would like to express in \"FFVersusXIII\" things that are not done in the numbering title. The word \"Versus\" means \"turn around\" in Latin, but in English it means \"versus\", which means \"paired\". It will be such a work.\n\nインタビュー『ファイナルファンタジーXIII』 - 電撃オンライン\n\n最強のゲーム情報サイト！ 読み応え抜群のレビューやインタビューなども盛りだくさん！\n\nVersus 13 was announced back in 2006 same year as FNC and 13, though unlike its counter part at this stage Versus did not have much people behind it, for its first years most of what we saw and knew of versus was all conceptual not much work behind the game had began at that point due to other projects at Square Enix like Kingdom heats Birth By Sleep but mainly due to projects in the works at\n\nDevelopment Studio 1, the main team tasked with making offline Final Fantasy that was busy working on 13 (same studio would later be the main force behind Final Fantasy 7 Remake).\n\nSo for a couple of years no big work was being done on Versus 13 and what fans have seen was so far conceptual but its clear it did hit with fans but it did have ramifications when Versus was eventually rebooted under director Tabata:\n\nAlso the situation with FFXV is very unique and I have learned one thing from this experience: when you release information about a game very early, as it was the case with Versus XIII which is a game that never really took shape, how the information is viewed by the world is very different to what we think.\n\nTo answer the second part of your question, I also agree with you that gaining information too early is a very bad thing. For FFXV, this is obviously a special situation, having started out as Versus XIII and having information released at that time. That's something we can't turn the clock back on. We have to continue and put a lot of effort to maintain that relationship with the fans to reassure them. For our next game, we would never want you to get information at such an early point, because it's counterproductive. But with FFXV, we have to continue and make the best of it, unfortunately.\n\nGamescom 2015 : Interview Hajime Tabata (ENG) - Finaland\n\nVotre site de référence sur la saga Final Fantasy et toute l’actualité Square Enix\n\nSo yeah until 13's release in 2009 in Japan and 2010 everywhere else Versus 13 didn't see much action, but in 3-4 years time things would change.\n\nDevelopment\n\nVersus 13 was to be built using the tools of its counterpart Final Fantasy 13, which meant everyones favorite engine....\n\nCRYSTAL TOOLS\n\nProblem was Crystal Tool and how its engine and tools were designed was counter productive to what Versus wanted to do, Crystal Tools was good for making the kinds of closed off and narrow (think 10) environments that FF13 was made up from, Versus from the get go was always thought up to be a more open/open world exprience and the tools that crystal tools provided were not up to the task.\n\nto quote Technical Director of XV:\n\nthe 'universal engine' Toriyama's team built couldn't handle Versus 13 anymore - because it had been so carefully designed to fit FF13's specifications, it now buckled under the vast open-world environments that had been designed for Versus 13 with technical specifications, making it virtually unusable.\n\nHow Final Fantasy 15 almost destroyed itself (with help from FF13)\n\nBack in 2008, things weren't going well for Final Fantasy 13. A few short years after it was announced as the leading entry in Square-Enix's Fabula Nova\n\nLuckily Square did have another Priority Engine in the works that was more suited for the open environments Versus was seeking, Luminous Engine so in 2010 the team made the switch to the developing Luminous Engine and Versus 13 went into Full Production.\n\nCommon Misconception I see is that people think Versus didn't have much of a development team, true early on as FF13 was still being developed but once that was nearing its end and out the door Versus 13 did have lots of people working on the game.\n\nRoberto Ferrari a character designer that has worked with Nomura since 2010, worked on Versus, 15 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake had this to say:\n\nI wasn't part of the 2010 group from XIII that \"would have scratched their bellies\" (and then turned into the XV one), I came into May 2010. I know I was called in when a (female) designer resigned since she wasn't able to get any kind of approval from the art director. Then from 2010 till the end of 2011 I worked on the designs I got assigned with, without any big issues. That's why when the team got resized from 200 workers to around 20 in 2012\n\nSo from 2010 to late 2012 (thats when Tabata and the Type 0 team came on board so while a good amount of the original team were not there they were filled in by Tabatas group), Versus 13 by Robertos own words had a team of about 200 people, which is about the same amount of people as Final Fantasy 13 had at its height of development.\n\nSo 2 years or so of full development and things were not going well to say the least to once again Quote Roberto:\n\nThe staff -200 souls- had to work when the story still wasn't completely defined. In fact, this story kept changing every 3 months and the definitive delivery date for the game was for the end of 2014 (who would have thought it would have been pushed back to November 2016?).\n\nEven after the years of conceptual work and predevelopment as FF13 was being worked on and as the game was in full development Final Fantasy Versus 13 story and concepts were not set in stone, as development progressed the story of Versus kept on changing and as we know from the development history of Bioshock Infinite changing os a story during development that should have been pretty much set can have drastic impacts on the pipeline and production of the game much less morale especially when at this point Versus was no longer a PS3 exclusive but aiming for next gen systems with the game set to be released by the end of the year of 2014.\n\nAlong with the idea of Versus 13 being a trilogy of its own games\n\nThis was a big task for developers and what didn't help the game and teams confidence was the reaction to Versus 13 inside the company.\n\nSquare Enix Internals & Reboot\n\nDespite Square Enix saying Versus was doing well and such with PR, but on the inside of Square Enix it was anything but happiness with Versus 13.\n\nThen President and CEO of the time Wada along with other executives were presented in 2012 what had been done so far with Versus 13.\n\nWada and Excs were not impressed nor inspired what Nomura and his teams have put up in the time since the game went into full production in 2010, from what Wada and others at Square Enix saw and played of Versus 13 it just wasn't fun nor did they feel confident putting in the resources to finish a game that no one was happy with.\n\nFrom duckroll\n\nWada confidence in the game was such that he was seriously considering just cancelling Final Fantasy Versus 13, thats when he decided to give a call to Tabata:\n\nHajime Tabata:\n\nIn 2012 I took a phone call from our previous CEO, Yoichi Wada. He told me that there was a great deal of trouble with Final Fantasy Versus XIII, a separate project to Final Fantasy XIII. He told me that he was considering whether or not to cancel the project. If he did, he said, then he'd want to really start it up from scratch again and take it off in a new direction, and maybe have me take on that project.\n\nThere are problems with every videogame project, of course. But with Final Fantasy Versus XIII the period of trying to fix the issues just went on way too long. It had already been in development for six years by that point. It couldn't carry on in the same way. That was when I became involved and started to change the project towards becoming Final Fantasy XV.\n\nHashimoto:\n\nEveryone was doing what they thought was right with these projects. Nobody was deliberately trying to grind the company into the dirt. But there are some things where the problem only becomes clear once the games take shape. Sometimes you only realize where you've gone wrong after the work is finished.\n\nEdge #314 Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary Special Edition.\n\nTabata and his team made a demo of what would become Final Fantasy 15 that Wada and co were more comfortably and confident in and thus the greenlight of versus into FF15 had began.\n\nThough with two big parts that needed to be agreed to.\n\n#1. Final Fantasy 15 would be a standalone game, it would not have a sequel planned/multiple games like Versus 13\n\n#2. Final Fantasy 15 no matter what would be released by the end of 2016\n\nWith that in mind I think I will stop it here, I don't think i should now go into 15's production (maybe a thread later) but the intent of this thread was to give just a gist of what we know about Final Fantasy Versus 13.\n\nWhat I see in Final Fantasy threads is an unawreness to Versus 13's troubles, a rose tinted glass look at the game that most of us only ever saw concept footage and trailers that made the game look as best as it could just like what you see at E3 at times which aren't representative of the true game, remember Cyberpunk?\n\nLike lets not talk about some the bits from Versus like Stella being a ghost the entire game who was killed by Noctis as a kid.\n\nI'm reminded of the Camelot episode in Sopranos, where Tony really has only good things to say about his dad that he was an honorable good man when really as we see in the episode as Tony is foced to confront and meet his fathers Mistress.\n\nHe was a crook who didn't really care for his wife and kids and would rather spend time with his sleazy mistress than his own family.\n\nI didn't make this thread to bash or make fun of Nomura or that, far from it he is a talented director who worked and a big part of some of my favorite games of all time.\n\nBut no matter the director sometimes projects just never come together, that they may sound good in concept but when you're trying to make it all work it mix it all together into a cake....... it just doesn't come out right.\n\nFinal Fantasy Versus 13 was game that just never came together despite best intentions it was a game in development whos story keep changing, whos excs and producers didn't think was fun & had no confidence in, a game that had to get rebooted otherwise it would be canned and more.\n\nA Game that could never take shape.\n\nThank you all if you stayed to read the whole thread, I would also like to Liam Allen-Miller just cause I think he would like this thread"
