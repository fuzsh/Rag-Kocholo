        "text": "Final Fantasy VII Remake is set to launch this spring, on April 10, 2020. With that in mind, it’s a perfect time to look back at the OTHER Final Fantasy game that launched during the spring, 10 years ago. It’s time to talk about Final Fantasy XIII, one of THE most controversial games that Square Enix has ever created (with Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts III in the running for second place).\n\nIn 2006, Square Enix revealed a new project at E3: Fabula Nova Crystallis. This was to be a project where games made under this umbrella would feature similar concepts and mythologies. They didn’t necessarily share the same settings or casts, but concepts like crystals, mechanical gods, and destiny were all common motifs among them.\n\nFabula Nova Crystallis would have featured games like Final Fantasy Agito XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII. The former became Final Fantasy Type-0, while the latter underwent an infamously long period of development hell before becoming Final Fantasy XV. XV no longer has any relation to Fabula Nova Crystallis.\n\nLeading the charge, however, was Final Fantasy XIII. Like the other games under the FNC umbrella, Final Fantasy XIII suffered from a very troubled development cycle, and it shows in the final product. The development team at Square had to deal with technical difficulties that came with developing for a new, more powerful, and complex console, and thus had to spend a lot of time creating a new engine just for the game. They also lacked a shared vision until a demo of the game had to be created to pack in with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.\n\nAfter that, the game finally started to come together as a cohesive package. However, it was too late to implement changes in accordance to feedback and changing trends in the gaming industry. The end result is a divisive entry that some players loved, and others derided for being a hallway simulator with a bad story.\n\nMy personal take on Final Fantasy XIII\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is set in a futuristic world known as Cocoon. It is large sphere floating above the skies of Gran Pulse, and inside it, humanity lives comfortably under the guidance and care of mechanical gods known as fal’Cie. Each of the fal’Cie in Cocoon has a different, singular objective, from providing things like energy and sunlight to overseeing the supply and distribution of food.\n\nThe fal’Cie, however, cannot deviate from the task they are assigned. Thus, when they need to accomplish something outside of their usual scope of activities, they will brand a human and make them into a l’Cie. L’Cie are given superhuman strength and the ability to use powerful magic. However, they must complete an assigned task within a certain time limit, or risk becoming a Cie’th, a mindless zombie-esque creature. Successfully completing the task grants the l’Cie eternal life as a reward… in the form of turning into a crystal statue, becoming dormant until the fal’Cie decides to assign them another task.\n\nThe citizens of Cocoon are taught that Gran Pulse, the world below, is hell itself, and thus hold an extreme fear of anything or anyone from it. This fear is so great that when a fal’Cie from Pulse is discovered hiding in a city in Cocoon, the government orders a “Purge”, where all citizens of that city must be exiled to Gran Pulse. The game begins during the events of this Purge, where Lightning, a solider from the Guardian Corps, resigns from her position and voluntarily joins the Purge in hopes of finding her sister, Serah, who was captured and branded by the fal’Cie from Pulse.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII, at its core, is a story about overcoming fate and saving the world even though the people within it have been taught to fear and hate you. Because of this, the game’s cast spend a sizable amount of the game on the run. As they’re also mostly strangers to one another and suffer from a host of deep personal problems, they don’t get along very well for most of the game. This can cause them to come off as unlikable characters until they each go through their own personal arcs.\n\nThe other big issue with the story is how it handles its lore and world-building. Since you spend most of the game running down a linear pathway, there aren’t really any towns or NPCs to interact with. As a result, most of the information that would flesh out the world and better explain character motivations is placed inside of a Datalog that constantly updates throughout the narrative. Yes, having that information to read DOES add flavor to the setting and enriches the overall plot. But it comes at the cost of requiring the player to break up the pace in order to read the new Datalog entries and get a better understanding of what’s going on. And in a game with bad pacing and that delivers so little of that lore and world-building through dialogue and gameplay interactions, that’s not a good look.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII uses a unique ATB system that involves switching between character roles and stocking up attack commands. Each of the player characters comes with a certain number of ATB segments. Each segment represents an action they can take, with some stronger commands taking up multiple segments. You can choose to stock up each command manually, or you can select “Auto-Battle” to have the game choose the best set for you automatically. This is something that gets derided as “mash X to win”, or “a game that plays itself”. In truth, actually attempting to do something like that is almost certainly going to lead to a Game Over.\n\nEach of the 6 playable characters also have roles to choose from. These roles are:\n\nCommando: Focuses on physical attacks, and deals heavy damage to staggered enemies.\n\nRavager: Focuses on casting offensive spells and rapidly increasing the enemy’s stagger gauge. Enemies are staggered when the gauge is full, and take much more damage.\n\nSentinel: Functions as the tank. Sentinels can draw enemy attention in order to protect more fragile characters.\n\nSaboteur: Focuses on casting debuffs and status effects on enemies.\n\nSynergist: Focuses on powering up allies with buffs.\n\nMedic: Dedicated to fast healing.\n\nSuccess in this game requires players to set up and switch between Paradigms, which are combinations of all of the above roles. For example, one might start a fight with a team of a Synergist, Saboteur, and Ravager to weaken enemies and build up their stagger gauge. Then, they’d switch to a paradigm made up of 3 Commandos to deal heavy damage.\n\nThe result is a battle system with a lot of depth and challenge, but like the story, it suffers from pacing issues of its own. While it’s great that the mechanics allow for a challenging experience, the frequency of these fights can end up feeling exhausting.\n\nCharacter progression is also quite linear, though it doesn’t use a traditional leveling system like in other RPGs. Instead, winning battles presents you with Crystarium Points (CP) to spend in order to power up a character’s role. By spending enough points, you unlock direct stat bonuses, as well as new spells and abilities.\n\nThe problem, however, is just how limited and restrictive this system is. For most of the game, each character has access to only 3 roles. Spending CP is also a linear affair, with very little room to choose what you get. You simply move on a predetermined path until you reach the end of the Crystarium. On top of that, the game’s measures to prevent excessive grinding are to limit how far you can power up each character role until you reach particular story milestones, like defeating a certain boss.\n\nAll of the above results in a double-edged sword. On one hand, the developers were able to craft a tightly guided experience where all battles are challenging and require strategy and preparation. Players can’t just excessively grind until they become strong enough to steamroll everything in sight.\n\nBut this system of limitations, combined with the exploration being extremely linear, results in a huge chunk of the game from the midway point to the late-game being a tedious grind. You spend most of the story running down a hallway, fighting a tough enemy that takes several minutes to defeat, and then continue running forward until you reach another enemy. Rinse and repeat until you hit a save point or the boss of the chapter.\n\nYou don’t even get the ability to form your own team or pick who you control until chapter 10, which is about 70% of the way through the game! Chapter 11 is where the game also finally opens up and allows you to explore, though there isn’t much to do except side quests that involve hunting powerful enemies. It’s a shame, because while this is point where you finally start getting a lot more options to make more flexible team combinations and take on really fun battles, most players will be burned out by now. Likewise, while the story finally gets some really good character development around this point, players who found the cast intolerable early on will have dropped the game by now.\n\nAnd because characters only get 3 roles each until chapter 10, you don’t have much leeway for progression. This means that players who are hoping to finally get a chance to experiment will need to spend a lot of time grinding in order to get each character’s new roles up to par, further breaking up the game’s pacing.\n\nOn my first playthrough of the game sometime in 2011, I started with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm. The graphics were stunning, the battle system seemed really cool, and I was just excited to play a (then) next-gen RPG. But as the game progressed, that feeling soon gave way to boredom and tedium. I’d put the game down for long stretches of time, and then pick it back up for a bit, only to put it down again. It didn’t help that I didn’t have a good understanding of the game’s battle system back then, so I struggled a lot later in the game.\n\nMy second playthrough of the game started sometime in 2015. Again, due to that sense of tedium and boredom from the game’s pacing and design choices, I put the game down, this time for 3 years. It wasn’t until early 2018 that I decided to pick it back up and finish my second playthrough. It was here that I finally started to get an understanding on my mixed feelings towards the game and its various design choices.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII, on paper, presents a lot of great ideas. The lore is utterly fascinating, the concept of playing as a group of characters on the run from a society that fears them is refreshing, and the battle system is deep and strategic. The execution, however, is lacking. While the characters have their motivations for acting the way they do towards each other for most of the game, it doesn’t change the fact that you likely won’t be very fond of them for most of the story. The pacing and repetition due to the game’s refusal to allow experimentation with different options causes most of the playthrough to feel boring and tedious, and the way the world-building is handled makes it difficult to get emotionally invested in the setting.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII can be a difficult game to finish. But it’s not because of the challenging gameplay and deep mechanics. Despite selling millions of copies and being well received by critics, Final Fantasy XIII is infamous in the fandom due to its many core design problems, and has left a black mark on the series’ reputation that hasn’t quite gone away to this day.\n\nVerdict: Buy (if you can get it for $15 USD or less)"
