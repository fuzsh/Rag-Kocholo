        "text": "*Not quite new*\n\nFinal Fantasy Versus is a darker, more action based RPG developed by Square Enix exclusively for Playstation 3. It’s directed by highly acclaimed Final Fantasy character designer Tetsuya Nomura. Like the other games in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series there isn’t much known about this game at the time of writting. Square Enix wants to focus on Final Fantasy XIII, but each time a new trailer or scan shows up for this game all the fans are stunned by how cool it looks.\n\nFinal Fantasy Versus is “a fantasy based on reality”. It is much more darker than other FF games. It is set in the current modern day but still there will be some fantasy elements like magic included. When the story unfolds players will experience “human emotions to the highest degree ever seen from a Square Enix game” according to Square Enix.\n\nStory\n\nLittle is known about the story in Final Fantasy Versus XIII\n\nThe main character Noctis is a prince and the last heir of a dynasty in an isolated kingdom which is much more advanced than the outside world. He needs to protect the last crystal against invaders who’re trying to obtain the crystal for ages.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nPlatform: Playstation 3 (Blu-Ray disc)\n\nGenre: Action-RPG\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nDevelopment started: 2005 (possible 2004)\n\nDirector and Character Designer: Tetsuya Nomura\n\n(Character Designer: FFV-FFVIII, FFX,FNC, Kingdom Hearts series)\n\n(Director: Kingdom Hearts, The world ends with you)\n\nProducer: Shinji Hashimoto\n\nMovie director: Takeshi Nozue (FFIX-X, FFVII Advent Children, Kingdom Hearts series, Dissidia: Final Fantasy)\n\nMusic Composer: Yoko Shimomura (Kingdom Hearts series, Legend of Mana)\n\nCharacters\n\nStella is confirmed to be the antagonist of Final Fantasy Versus XIII. In a trailer released back in April 2009, Stella and Noctis are seen together having a lovely conversation, In another scene they’re shown in tears preparing to start a fight. It was confirmed that Stella became the antagonist because of unfortunate events in the past.\n\nThe following 3 characters have been seen in trailers, but nothing is known about them for the moment, even their names are unknown so I gave them nicknames which are often used on the internet.\n\nTrailers\n\nThis is the third trailer released for this game. Personally it’s the best trailer released so far, and for me it’s one of the most impressive trailers that I’ve ever seen in video gaming history! Although I will have to link you to Veoh to view this video, I can confirm that this is the best quality available for this trailer:\n\nWatch FF13 Versus DKΣ3713 in Gaming | View More Free Videos Online at Veoh.com\n\nThe next (fourth) trailer was released together with the FFXIII demo back in April 2009 and continous where the third trailer ended. This shows the conversation between Noctis and Stella with Japanese subtitles only. Tetsuya Nomura confirmed that this scene was created with the help of full body motion capture and is available in full HD on Gamtrailers:\n\nhttp://www.gametrailers.com/player/48155.html\n\nThis is the translation from the conversation:"
