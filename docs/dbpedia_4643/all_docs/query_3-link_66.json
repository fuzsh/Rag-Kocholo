        "text": "Couchpotato\n\nPart-Time News-bot\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,600\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nDecember 18, 2014\n\n#1\n\nHardcore Gamer posted a new review for Final Fantasy XIII-2, and gave the game a final score of 4/5. Here is a short summary of why they gave the score.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 is the best entry in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series, offering far improved gameplay systems while giving players access to a highly diverse soundtrack and various timelines to explore. While the two protagonists are among the weaker of the franchise, the ability to recruit monsters into your party is a delightful change to the formula. The PC version is also a step up from what Square Enix offered a couple of months ago with Final Fantasy XIII, establishing more graphical options than ever before, but they still have a ways to go. While the seemingly automated combat system may turn some people away, and the lack of control of party members can be discouraging to some, it’s all streamlined well enough that players will enjoy how battles turn out. Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a step in the right direction for Square Enix, paving the way for future releases from the Japanese giant.\n\nMore information.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,600\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nThaurin\n\nSasqWatch\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 18, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,915\n\nLocation\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nDecember 18, 2014\n\n#2\n\nI bought this for cheap through Green Man Gaming, but now I'm having to decide whether to finish FFXIII. Currently, I'm on chapter 11 where it opens up with the missions, but all it seems is a big boring grind. Blegh.\n\nAny reason to play past chapter 11 instead of watching the recap or YouTube?\n\nJoined\n\nOct 18, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,915\n\nLocation\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nBrumbek\n\nKeeper of the Watch\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 5, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n626\n\nDecember 18, 2014\n\n#3\n\nWell…you are right at the point where you finally get to freely explore Gran Pulse, which for most of us was the most fun part of the game, hunting down the monsters and such.\n\nThe final chapters are a slog though. The final two linear levels can be very tough. And the final boss is such a chore if you haven't been vigilant to kill everything in the game to level up as much as possible.\n\nThe story is all that matters really…and the end game story part is very simple, really. So if you want to rush to FFXIII-2, which is a VASTLY superior game, just watch the final story stuff on YouTube or whatever. There are a few great story moments at the end with NPCs…but none of those NPCs factor into FFXIII-2 at all. For that matter, pretty much nothing at all transfers to FFXIII-2, story-wise, except that characters exist.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n626"
