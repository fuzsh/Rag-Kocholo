        "text": "Final Fantasy Type-0 and Final Fantasy Agito are both crossing the Pacific.\n\nFinal Fantasy Agito released last month in Japan for mobile phones, and today Square Enix announced that the game is being localized for North America for iOS and Android. The free-to-play game uses a turn-based combat system and allows for single or multiplayer and makes use of in-app purchases. Players create their own character which will interact with characters from Final Fantasy Type-0. The game’s story is affected by player choice and has a day-night cycle connected to real-world time.\n\nIn fact, at the same time, Square Enix announced in text at the end of their Agito trailer (below} that Final Fantasy Type-0 would be coming to North America as well on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Type-0 was originally a Japan only PSP release. Players control three characters they can switch between in a real-time, action-based battle system. Early news stated that Type-0 is also headed to Vita, but Sony stated that the only Sony platform planned is PS4.\n\nWhere do these games fit in the Final Fantasy series? Okay, this might get a little confusing. Most of us know that Final Fantasy is a thing and that Final Fantasy XIII was the first part of a series called the Fabula Nova Crystallis within the Final Fantasy franchise. The third game announced in the Fabula Nova Crystallis (after XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII, now Final Fantasy XV) was Final Fantasy Agito XIII, planned to be a mobile game. It was later renamed Final Fantasy Type-0, developed for PSP, and never made it’s planned release outside of Japan, until today’s announcement.\n\nThe game we know today as Final Fantasy Agito began development because Type-0 Director Hajime Tabata liked some of the concepts for the original Agito and decided to produce the game for smartphones."
