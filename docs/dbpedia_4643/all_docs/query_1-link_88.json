        "text": "Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the second direct sequel Square Enix has done to one of their core Final Fantasy titles, the first being Final Fantasy X-2. The game continues the story left behind with Lightning and Serah from Final Fantasy XIII. The game received mostly positive reviews, mainly towards the gameplay and graphics, with the only negatives coming towards the story line being long and confusing.\n\nMuch of the gameplay and mechanics remain the same with a few minor changes. Instead of having three characters in your paradigm, you now only have 2 main characters (Serah and Noel) and a choice of a Monster to fill the 3rd role. Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a part of the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" compiliation.\n\nPrologue\n\nThey all believed she was gone forever, never to return. Everyone, that is, except Serah Farron. She clung to a different truth. Lightning! Could she be alive? Could her beloved sister really be in that world of chaos and death, fighting to save a dying goddess?More"
