By reading a bit about it on the internet, I figured out, that FFXV is a part of the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis FF\" subseries, which also includes FFXIII and FF Type-0. Reading further, I even got the information, that FFXV was originally labeled \"FFXIII Versus\" before it became to big and turned into a major FF. But I haven't found out anything over than the simple fact, that all of these titles share the same mythos.\n\nSo here's my question:\n\nIs there anything important in FFXV, that refers to FFXIII or Type-0, which I won't understand to it's fullest unless I play these titles beforehand? For example, does FFXV require a basic grip of said mythos or do I get all the information I need in FFXV?\n\nAnd yes, I don't know anything about the mythos itself as of now, as I don't want to spoil myself, if it isn't important."
