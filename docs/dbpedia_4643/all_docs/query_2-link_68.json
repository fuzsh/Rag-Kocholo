        "text": "Square Enix has unleashed a new Final Fantasy XV trailer for your viewing pleasure amidst rumors of a delay for the upcoming JRPG behemoth.\n\nThis latest video offers a look at the waterside ecology of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One title, and includes music from British-based indie rockers, Florence + the Machine. Have a gander at the trailer below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/fF\n\nFinal Fantasy XV release date hit by possible delay\n\nAs mentioned, it has been reported that Final Fantasy XV has been delayed from its original release date of September 30 to November 30. Nothing official has been confirmed as of yet, although multiple sources have since corroborated the initial report.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV was originally in development as the PS3-exclusive Final Fantasy Versus XIII, which would have formed part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series of games that include Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Type-0.\n\nHowever, following a long period of silence on the game, Square Enix re-revealed the project at Sony’s E3 2013 presentation as Final Fantasy XV, now exclusive to current-generation consoles. The publisher later said that development on FFXV started around 2012, at which point Versus XIII was only around 25 percent finished.\n\nMany elements of the game’s previous incarnation are visible in Final Fantasy XV, such as the open-world setting and the character of Noctis and his band of freedom fighters. However, some elements, including the character of Stella, did not survive the transition to PS4.\n\nWant more Final Fantasy XV? Then check out the links below."
