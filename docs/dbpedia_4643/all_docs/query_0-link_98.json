        "text": "The real legacy of XV being birthed out of VersusXIII is that through layers of revision upon revision (not unlike how real religions form over centuries) you ended up with a game with a lot of fascinating background mythology that felt simultaneously ill-defined but also plausibly real and expansive beyond what we could figure out on our own inside the games. A bit like looking back at classical-period mythologies where we know the names of the deities and some of the more famous stories as filtered through the lenses of poetry and theatre, but we'll never truly grasp how the day-to-day religion actually worked or get a complete picture of all the beliefs.\n\nOn a more immediate level you can see this \"layers of revision\" if you watch the CGI prequel movie that had to be scripted and rendered before XV was even finished being revised, so certain characters seem quite different from their how they ultimately appear in-game. It almost feels like a different author's take on the same materials.\n\nPutting aside the more immediate qualities like the excellent inter-party banter, the combat system (which does have a lot of depth if you experiment with it more than the game ever really requires you to), etc. you're left with a game/story that always feels like there's an answer just around the corner, maybe just one more DLC away. That the entire story was ultimately Bahamut treating the history of humanity as a giant chessboard as a gamble to rid the universe of an ancient enemy in the form of the starscourge, the suffering of the little mortals be damned, leading to a great war between the gods over necessity vs. compassion, but then none of this really being explored in the game itself save for scant scraps of confusing exposition dumps... it's so frustrating. There's something really good there in the bones of the thing but they couldn't execute on it.\n\nI like XV way more than others I think but it's definitely not the game they'd have wanted to make if they didn't have to rush completely rebooting the darn thing from Nomura's half-developed concept teasers.\n\nBut man those concept teasers... I was incredibly intruiged by what looked like a corporation/yakuza-esque model of royalty as it was presented in the Versus teasers, and it seemed to be much more about feuding philosophies between nationstates rather than the \"evil war-mongering nation made even more evil due to influence from evil immortal\" stuff we ultimately got.\n\nTotally. I love Fabula Nova Crystallis. Back in the time I played and read everything which was available, including the books with fan translation. It's the biggest, deepest and most ambitious lore square has ever created for a FF. It was almost like the bible. The Lightning trilogy arc was just the top of the iceberg. And imo, the ending of Lightning Returns is one of the best endings FF has ever had, in fact when I watched it for the first time my immediate thought was that the game was indeed the \"final fantasy\", not just as a game, as a concept itself.\n\nMan, a collection of the trilogy for modern consoles would be great, but I imagine crystal tools engine was and is a pain to work with.\n\nBut ultimately isn't FNC sometimes overblown as a 'thing' by fans? I remember reading an interview with some of the producers, and really it was an initiative by the creative teams to create some structure to the meta-lore of the Final Fantasy series as it moved into the HD-age. Crystals, summons, Chaos, etc. were the connective tissue identity of FF but as there wasn't a strong definition of what any of it meant each entry just had to wing it each time and find a new interpretation. My understanding was FNC was almost like an experiment to create enough \"rules\" for what those shared meta-lore elements meant to give a more consistent feeling for the series, but with enough flexibility that each entry could still feel different enough and be set in an entirely different universe.\n\nSo, from what I'm hearing here, it's sort of like this?\n\nSE: \"Hey Nomura, it's been a few years. How is progress on Final Fantasy XIII Versus going?\"\n\nNomura: \"So COOL. I have a great idea for like the first part of the game is set in a city, and we make the entire city explorable and there's this whole theme about destiny... and THEN we go on a massive road trip and explore a huge open world setting, and THEN we do a VI style time jump to a dark twisted version of that open world for the finale. I just need a few more years.\"\n\nSE: \"Yeah... we need Final Fantasy XV to come out NOW, and for you to get back to work on Kingdom Hearts 3. So you're off XIII Versus, it's now XV as we don't have anything else in the works and need a big FF success since XIV was a failure upon launch.\"\n\nNomura: \"But... but...\"\n\nSE: \"Tabata, salvage this.\"\n\nTabata: \"Um, wow. Nomura didn't really flesh a lot of this out. I'll cut out his proposed first part, and turn that into a film. But so that it will stand alone, we invent a new protagonist to do all the stuff that thematically should be our main character. Then we do the road trip, that stuff we can actually manage, and just squeeze in the dark world stuff at the very end. We have no time, we're behind schedule, and Nomura bit off WAY more than he could chew. But management won't let me ship an unfinished game, right?\""
