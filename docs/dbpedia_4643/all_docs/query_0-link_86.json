        "text": "Final Fantasy Versus XIII was roughly a quarter complete before it shifted to become Final Fantasy XV.\n\nSpeaking to IGN at PAX in Seattle, Final Fantasy XV director Hajime Tabata explained the transition.\n\n“It’s a little bit rough, but in terms of how much it had progressed in terms of development, Versus XIII was around 20 to 25 percent,” Tabata told IGN via translator. “In terms of character designs or visuals, nothing really had been fixed at that point. We were still working on updating it and revising those designs.”\n\nTabata says that development on Final Fantasy XV started around three years ago, and Versus XIII “was being developed up to the point that XV started development.”\n\n“With regards to that overarching universe and setting for the world of Versus XIII, it was constructed around the Fabula Nova Crystallis setting, so there was a certain amount that had been included and decided upon,” Tabata explained. “But when we shifted toward XV, obviously we took that apart and evaluated what would make sense and what wouldn’t. So there’s portions that remain from the earlier Versus XIII, but then there’s portions which evolved or changed due to the change in the direction of the title.”\n\n“Originally when we were working on Versus XIII, we were working on an earlier generation of console and the technology that we were working on was utilized for this earlier generation as an extension of the PS2 era. So that was a significant difference between XV and Versus XIII,” he added.\n\nFinal Fantasy Versus XIII was announced way back in 2006 as a PlayStation 3 exclusive. At E3 2013, Square Enix announced that it has evolved into Final Fantasy XV. Earlier this year, Tabata confirmed that a Versus XIII character and scene were cut from the game.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV will be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016, with a specific release date coming in March.
