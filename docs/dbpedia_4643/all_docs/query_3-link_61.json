        "text": "When Square Enix first announced the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy 13 \"series\", the news was met with many rolling eyes. It felt as if they were trying to force an entire universe on us before we ever had the chance to decide if it was something we wanted. This was probably due to the popularity and success of Final Fantasy 7 and its spin-offs. But there was one major difference -- we already loved Final Fantasy 7 before they started expanding on that universe. Final Fantasy 13? Not so much.\n\nIn March of 2010, over 1.3 million copies of Final Fantasy 13 were sold in North America, with over 800,000 of these units being the Playstation 3 version of the game. In April of 2010, an estimated 50,000 copies of the PS3 version Final Fantasy 13 were sold in North America. I've been ritualistically following the NPDs for years, and I have never seen a drop-off that vast.\n\nWhy was the drop-off so large? Well, it could be that the audience for JRPGs may have tapered off due to the lackluster presence of the genre this console generation. Or it could be that Final Fantasy 13 is possible the lowest reviewed entry in the main series since the NES era. The game also had a pretty terrible word-of-mouth.\n\nSo then there is this other game. It has an amazingly restrained art style, a real-time action battle system, and an open explorable world map with cities, towns, and the like. An actual RPG, if you will. Watch this extended trailer if you haven't yet.\n\nYour eyes do not deceive you, that is a real car (sans rockets, wings, feathers, or zippers). This game looks nothing like Final Fantasy 13, or any Final Fantasy game for that matter. Versus 13 looks new and fresh, and it could very well get people into the genre who have been wary of the Final Fantasy name. That is, of course, if the name was different.\n\nSo why is Square Enix throwing away the potential to start are new major brand for themselves and the genre. Back on the SNES and Playstation, Squaresoft did something truly bold, they actually used different names for games that were... you know... different. And while not every series became as popular as popular as Final Fantasy, the genre thrived because of the variety. And then came Kingdom Hearts. A fresh new action RPG series that has since become just a popular as Final Fantasy. Would it have been as successful if the game was called Final Fantasy 10: Mickey Mouse Edition? Well maybe; but then again, the Final Fantasy name was a lot more respected back then.\n\nAnd that's my point. Coming off such a huge disappointment with Final Fantasy 13, this is the perfect opportunity for Square Enix to finally start something new. And while the game is certainly new, the name isn't. It will carry with it negative connotations that it doesn't deserve, and it might even affect sales.\n\nSo what does should Square Enix do now? Well, it may already be too late. They could relaunch the brand at Tokyo Game Show this year. Or they could just change the name for Western audience. Final Fantasy doesn't carry the same weight it used to here(especially not Final Fantasy 13), and if they were so concerned about sales in Japan, they would have called it Dragon Quest Versus 9. It's just as random of a name really. My vote is to just call it Versus. Short, to the point, and it would share its name with a badass movie.\n\nThoughts?"
