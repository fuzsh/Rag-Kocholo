        "text": "We all kind of imagined how crazy we would all go when Kingdom Hearts III was announced, but this is just so bizzare. There's obviously still a MASSIVE amount of speculation to be had about a release date (it wouldn't be Nomura if he didn't leave SOME to the imagination ) but honestly, I'm ecstatic with excitement right now.\n\nAs far as the trailer, I loved it. I think it definitely revamped the basic story line of what the game's direction/plot will ESSENTIALLY be about. I definitely like the fact that Master Eraqus will have at least some part in the big finale (even if it is just the idea of him and not actually him) as pointed out by the Keyblade being found in the trailer. The graphics look like something from a dream. I am curious to know what part Traverse Town will have to play in Kingdom Hearts III. Overall, I'm stoked. I definitely knew that it was going to be exclusively for Play Station 4 and that's totally fine. I feel like Kingdom Hearts III deserves the best possible development it can get. What are your guys' thoughts? This is it!\n\nIm so happy and so sad about this at the same time.\n\nIm so glad that Versus is coming out(It may not be part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series anymore BUT I DONT CARE) and KH3 IS BEING WORKED ON!!! But im sad because THEY'RE PS4 EXCLUSIVE. Now i have to buy a PS4, GOD DAMN YOU NOMURA WHY DID YOU firetruckING DO THIS. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?"
