        "text": "I’m currently making my way through the Fabula Nova Crystallis, and I recently finished up the original game. It’s a mess, and one deserving of a thorough critical breakdown, which Matt handily provides throughout his Let’s Play. Here’s an episode from it that puts some of the game’s ambitions and failures in context with the rest of the Final Fantasy series.\n\nAs a relative newcomer to Final Fantasy, I don’t have the familiarity to offer that kind of analysis, so instead enjoy a series of contextless anecdotes about my time playing the (in)famous video game, Final Fantasy XIII. There will be spoilers, there will be a bunch of meaningless lore jargon, and all the earnestness imaginable.\n\nHonestly, there is no approach more fitting. (more…)\n\nContent Warning: This piece contains fully sexually explicit discussion, and talk about dysphoria and suicidal thoughts.\n\nIt is Not Safe For Work.\n\nWhen rain mixes with cotton, it sticks gently to my skin. Layers of clothing blend together in the wet, rough plaid over-shirt and soft black t-shirt forming an armour that encases my torso. The rain spills down upon my exposed skin, cooling my burning head. Keeping me alert. Keeping me alive. Technically, I’m a wanted fugitive hiding out from the CIA, but in all honesty, I can’t remember where I was going. I don’t care who happens to be chasing me, and I don’t care whether I get away. I just want to stand here for a while longer, shirt clinging to the curve of my hips, hair cropped yet shaggy, blowing over my face in the wind.\n\nI don’t want to do anything. I just want to be.\n\nBefore I played Beyond: Two Souls, I’d never felt this so strongly. We played that game eight months ago, and in the time since I haven’t once tried to write down this reaction, to codify and analyse it, or even take the time to understand it for myself. The game had tapped into an unease within me, and for the first time I consciously acknowledged the dull pain I feel every day. The pain I feel when I catch a glimpse of my face in a mirror, when I get undressed to shower, when the man at the restaurant firmly shakes my hand. Playing this, I Iet myself, for just a moment, to imagine what it would be like to be free of that pain. The sensation I felt being Jodie Holmes, simply felt more correct than I how I felt trapped inside my own skin. (more…)\n\nThis post is a little of an experiment, something more casual than I tend to write, as you can tell by the fact I’m talking to you all conversational right now. Hey, hi, I’m Jackson, this is me writing some of the ol’ words about video games, come in and take a seat on the carpet.\n\nWe here at Abnormal Mapping are having a bout of intense video game apathy at the moment, Matt’s getting way into reading, I’m getting way into music. This is actually great because having wide interests is key in life; the insularity of games writing and culture (even the alternative and queer cultures that we tend to frequent, away from mainstream space), is often their achilles heel. With this apathy in mind, I’ve been a thinking about what to put on the site, because whilst I want to follow my whims and my heart in terms of where I place my time and energy, I also want to build upon the work of the last year or so, and write more here on Abnormal Mapping Dot Com.\n\nLong term, who knows what that means, maybe I’ll be posting short-stories and experiments on other websites, hell, maybe I’ll still be posting them here. We’ve deliberately avoided having a considered editorial voice, because we’re close friends and chat about our opinions regarding the site regularly. It’s grown in interesting ways that we’d have never pursued had we set up some kind of agreed upon mandate as a duo upon starting. The future is vast and fascinating, and interest sets widening and evolving, however uncertain they make the foundations you create for yourself, should never be seen as a bad thing.\n\nShort term, it means I want my games writing to reflect my game playing, which has shifted far more towards small art games you can find on itch.io or Game Jolt, works that I feel are not best supported by 1000-or-so word essays, a form of games writing that comes out of both old guard review style, as well as the current wave of academically influenced criticism. The latter of which is something a great many friends of mine on twitter are part of, their conversations attempting to build critical foundations in games that haven’t yet been formed. The work these folks do is important and thankless (go to our Reading List to take a look at a few of them!), but ultimately something I don’t think I’m a good fit for. When I write long form, I want to be personal, confessional, with an emotional rather than critical focus.\n\nAll of which is to say that I’m playing lots of these smaller games, these pointed works that convey a tone, or an emotion with honesty and simplicity, and wanted this week’s writing to reflect that. The entries on this list share no connection other they fulfil that exact criteria, and I’ve played them recently, and think they’re worthy of your time.

Whether they have been shrunk or the pillars of writing have grown is beyond the pay grade of these two intrepid wingmen, but as they juke around zines and loop through forests of critical theory they arrive at their destination: Fortress Games Podcasts. Their payloads are ready, a full tactical strike of thermonuclear cast, meant to eradicate the enemy and wrest victory from certain defeat. They squeeze the triggers, and await orders to fire.\n\nPlease subscribe via our RSS or iTunes!
