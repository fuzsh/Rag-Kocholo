        "text": "Description\n\nAn open world action role-playing video game that shares a thematic connection with Fabula Nova Crystallis. It's a major departure from previous games, providing a darker atmosphere that focuses on more realistic environments and human characters than previous entries.\n\nEnroute to wed his fiancée Luna on a road trip with his best friends, Prince Noctis is advised by news reports that his homeland has been invaded and taken over under the false pretense of a peace treaty – and that he, his loved one and his father King Regis, have been slain at the hands of the enemy.\n\nTo gather the strength needed to uncover the truth and reclaim his homeland, Noctis and his loyal companions must overcome a series of challenges in a spectacular open world - that is filled with larger-than-life creatures, amazing wonders, diverse cultures and treacherous foes."
