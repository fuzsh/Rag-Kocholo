        "text": "Nov. 19th, 2014, Square Enix posted on its official blog, indicating that pieces of DLC from the console version of Final Fantasy XIII-2 will be included in the upcoming PC/Steam release.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 is coming to PC on December 11, 2014 with a whole host of enhancements and features specifically for the PC version.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 is a console role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries.\n\nIt is also stated on the official blog that all the major DLC bundled together will come with the PC version of Final Fantasy XIII-2 at no extra cost. Even though due to the licensing and contractual restrictions, which prevented Square Enix from bringing all of the FF XIII-2 DLC to the PC version, a large majority of it will be contained within the download according to Square Enix; which means that the other console DLC content will not be released with the original Windows PC release of Final Fantasy XIII-2, or later on as separate update content.\n\nHere is a list of all the major DLC for Final Fantasy XIII-2, including ‘Lightning: Requiem of the Goddess,’ which Square claimed as the best and most important bit of DLC.\n\nColiseum Battles\n\nOmega (from Final Fantasy V)\n\nGilgamesh (from Final Fantasy V)\n\nUltros & Typhon (from Final Fantasy VI)\n\nPuPu (from Final Fantasy VIII)\n\nLightning & Lieutenant Amodar (from Final Fantasy XIII)\n\nPSICOM officer Jihl Nabaat (from Final Fantasy XIII)\n\nOutfits for Serah\n\nSummoner’s Garb\n\nBeachwear\n\nWhite Mage\n\nOutfits for Noel\n\nBattle Attire\n\nSpacetime Guardian\n\nBlack Mage\n\nOutfits for Mog\n\nA Wondrous Wardrobe\n\nScenarios/Story DLC\n\nSazh: Heads or Tails?\n\nLightning: Requiem of the Goddess\n\nSnow: Perpetual Battlefield\n\nIt is also know that Final Fantasy XIII-2 also comes with a load of other PC-specific features which it will have 60 FPS support from launch, customizable rendering resolution as well as Japanese (and English) voice support with subtitles."
