        "text": "We're a little less than a month away from seeing the true Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Square Enix's big \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" press conference will be held on January 18 in Tokyo, and based off recent comments from producer Tetsuya Nomura, it's going to be packed full of content for Versus and other titles. Square Enix has made a few changes to the conference. First, it's now officially known as \"1st Production Department Premier.\" The January 18 date is different from the originally announced January 11 date. Also, the event is no longer a \"press conference,\" but instead targets fans. Square Enix will be packing the Roppongi Toho Cinemas venue with 300 people across two showings, and will also be streaming the second showing live.\n\nThe \"1st Production Department\" at Square Enix handles games like Fabula Nova Crystallis (that's the series that includes FFXIII, Versus XIII and Agito XIII), Dissidia Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts. These series will all be at the event. In a recent interview with Japan's Dengeki PlayStation magazine, Tetsuya Nomura said that the lineup will include Fabula Nova Crystallis, Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix (a re-release of the international BbS with new content) and Kingdom Hearts 3D for 3DS.\n\nOf these, Nomura teased what we can expect from Versus. Main character Noctis will speak for the first time. Additionally, we'll get some footage from the game itself rather than the image videos we've been seeing until now.\n\nNomura said to expect much in the way of information and surprises.\n\nThe streaming version of the event appears to be just for Japanese audiences. If you're in Japan, register at the Square Enix Members fan site. Only 10,000 people will be selected to view the event."
