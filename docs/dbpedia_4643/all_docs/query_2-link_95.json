        "text": "Back in 2011 I saw Final Fantasy Type-0 and I wanted it. It looked like Final Fantasy Type-0 would join Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep and many more in the list of amazing JRPGs on the PSP.\n\nAlas it was not meant to be, as Final Fantasy Type-0 never came to the West, it remained a Japanese exclusive. The only way we could play the game was to learn Japanese or play a fan translation. I never played a fan translation of Final Fantasy Type-0 because few fan translations are superbly done and I’ve been let down by fan translations before. So at E3 2014, when Square Enix announced Final Fantasy Type-0 HD would be released in the West for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I jumped for joy.\n\nThe director Hajime Tabata apologised to Final Fantasy fans in the West for waiting so long for an official release. He didn’t have to apologise but he wanted to. Type-0 wasn’t the first Final Fantasy that Tabata served as director on, he was the director of Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII and is also the director of the upcoming Final Fantasy XV.\n\nWhat makes Type-0 interesting and unique are its characters and its combat. Final Fantasy Type-0 features 14 playable characters and you can select a party of three characters. Each of the 14 characters as their own unique weapon, personality and fight style.\n\nThe combat isn’t turn based, which might make a few old school Final Fantasy fans angry. The combat system is a real-time combat system and is similar to that of Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, where the player can move the character around and attack and use items.\n\nThe story is about four nations who lived peacefully until the Milites Empire attacked the other three nations and took over two of them, leaving one nation Rubrum. Class 0 fight back against the Milites Empire and they hope to defeat them and restore peace.\n\nType-0 is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series of Final Fantasy games, along with Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Final Fantasy Lightning Returns and the upcoming Final Fantasy XV.\n\nAs if getting Final Fantasy Type-0 HD wasn’t enough, if you pre-order Type-0 HD, Square Enix are also adding a voucher for a Final Fantasy XV demo titled, ‘Episode Duscae’. It is worth noting that there is no release date for the demo yet.\n\nFinal Fantasy fans in the West have waited a long time for Final Fantasy Type-0, so consider Type-0 HD one of those rare miracles in gaming where the publishers finally do what the fans have been asking for."
