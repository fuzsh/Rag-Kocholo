        "text": "I paid $34.65 for the Crisis Core Complete Guide. Not too bad.\n\nAnd what book is this, Strangelove!? I must zee!\n\nChecked again but still didn't notice it, though there are a lot of books there so it would be easy to miss. It's called \"Final Fantasy A Go Go!\" (&#12501;&#12449;&#12452;&#12490;&#12523;&#12501;&#12449;&#12531;&#12479;&#12472;&#12540;&#12391;&#36938;&#12435;&#12391;&#12415;&#12414;&#12379;&#12435;&#12363;&#65311 , released at the time of FFIX (bears the logo in the corner of the cover). Here is a few pictures including the cover:\n\nhttp://f-p-h2o.fan.coocan.jp/ffbook-ff-a-go-go.html\n\nIt's a strange book, really. There is some basic FFIX stuff in it but a lot of it is essays about games, different ways to play or enjoy games, a lot at the history of role playing and computer games, a bit on the FF film. I managed to get it on eBay years and years ago, and since it is a Digicube book that isn't an Ultimania that's probably the only place you will see it now.\n\nAnd for the sake of completion, there was another version the FFVII Complete/&#35299;&#20307;&#30495;&#26360; (original version was a blue cover with Cloud's picture), and a follow up to the Cloud vol.1 was released, titled \"CLOUD Message\".\n\nEh, from what I could see, the Memorial Albums for FFVIII and FFIX weren't particularly interesting and not worth buying. They were just screenshots with descriptions. If they were the extensive scripts of the games like the FFVII International Memorial Album, I would have picked them up, but as they seem to be, they're useless to me in terms of information or artwork. Maybe someday...\n\nAnd I have never heard of Final Fantasy A Go Go! Looks weird, but about the same WTF Japan as Choco Choco Bonbon! That one was weeeeeird. But funny. And I will have to look into those FFVII books. CLOUD Message sounds familiar...but I don't know if I've seen it or not. Hmm. Research time!\n\nAnyways, now it's FFX and FFX-2 time!\n\nLeft image is pretty much FFX, right is pretty much FFX-2.\n\nFrom the left of the left:\n\nFinal Fantasy X Visual Arts Collection\n\nElectronic Gaming Monthing Limited Edtion FFX issue with original Amano artwork\n\nFinal Fantasy X World Preview Guide (V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy X (game and Bradygames guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy X OST\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 OST\n\nSutaki da ne Single (RIKKI)\n\nFinal Fantasy X Chips\n\nFinal Fantasy X guide with X-2 preview (by Media Works)\n\nFinal Fantasy X World Guide - Yevon's Dogma and People on the Spira (by Famitsu. I REALLY want to know what this is. Is it canon? If so, it would revolutionize the history of Spira. It's a series of stories that have tons of historical prequel-type info for Seymour's pilgrimage, Braska's pilgrimage, tons of other side-characters, and the world of Spira in general. I would kill to have this translated!)\n\nAnd a bunch of little preview-type mini-books for Final Fantasy X. I got them in a batch of five, and they're just the most basic of preview guides, only a dozen pages each.\n\nFrom the left of the right image:\n\nAnother little mini-preview guide for FFX-2\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 (game and Bradygames guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 Limited Edition Bradygames guide with Art Collection book\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 Visual Arts Collection\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 \"The Sphere With Materials\" guide (by Digicube)\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 International+Last Mission Official Guide (by V-Jump)\n\nAnd I have the digital copies of FFX Piano Collections, Vocal Collection, and Unreleased Tracks, and FFX-2 Piano Collections, Vocal Collections (Japanese and English), and the X-2 International+Last Mission extra tracks.\n\nI do not have the International version of X in the hopes that someday it will be released here, and it seems my patience might pay off with the HD remake. *crosses fingers*\n\nNext, FFXI! (and FFXIV if there's room)\n\nNah, I got the FFX and X-2 Ultimanias and soundtracks long after they were released, and they just came with the books/CD's. And I found your Final Fantasy A Go Go on Amazon.co.jp. For 1 Yen! Hah. I may scan a few pages of the World Guide just so someone with a better translational eye can gauge it's real worth. It feels like it would be something incredible for fans of FFX if it's even remotely canon.\n\nAnyways, FFXI and XIV! (note: I don't pretend to have every FFXI book out there. There's just too many and seeing as I haven't even played the game, it's tough to justify or make sense of them all. I only have what I felt were the most interesting or in-depth ones)\n\nOkay, fromt left of the left image:\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack\n\nSanctuary Final Fantasy XI - Music From the Other Side of Vana'diel (by Star Onions)\n\nSword Songs Final Fantasy XI Battle Collection\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Chips\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box (includes soundtracks for FFXI original, Rise of the Zilart, Chains of Promathia, Treasures of Aht Urhgan, Piano Collections, and Unreleased Tracks)\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Vana'diel Study Guide (good for Japanese>English names of things)\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart EXPERT guide (also good for Japanese>English names of things)\n\nElectronic Gaming Monthly Limited Edition FFXI issue with original Amano cover art\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Bradygames guide x2 (I have no idea how this happened)\n\nRight Image, from the left:\n\nFinal Fantasy XI 5th Anniversary Vana'diel Memoirs\n\nFinal Fantasy XI World Concept Guide\n\nFinal Fantasy XI 2005 Fashion Guide (there's actually quite a few of these fashion guides)\n\nFinal Fantasy XI 10th Anniversary Premier Guide\n\nFinal Fantast XI Maniax Hunter's Bible (there's a few of these too, but without knowing FFXI well, I can't really sort them all out.)\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Life in Vana'diel x2 (again, no idea how I ended up with two of these, heh)\n\nFinal Fantasy XI 10th Anniversary Official Memorial Book - A Decade of Vana'diel\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV Collectors Edition (game and adventure log book w/concept art gallery. I still got the Onion Helm code if anyone wants it!)\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV Official Starter Guide (the ONLY guide that exists in any language for this game)\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV Field Tracks\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV Battle Tracks (Nail of the Heavens is classic Uematsu!)\n\nAnd I have digital copies of FFXI Wings of the Goddess soundtrack, and the other Star Onions album, and I have the Good King Moggle Mog XII song from FFXIV on file too, because it's awesome.\n\nAnd that's all she wrote for the MMO's! No, I don't actually own FFXI outside of the Japanese version I got with the Ultimate Box, and I don't intend to play FFXIV. Crazy, huh?\n\nFFXII and FFXIII next!\n\nGetting pretty efficient at putting these together now! Also, the pile's finally thinning out.\n\nFFXII and FFXIII:\n\nOkeys, from the left image, left side:\n\nOn the bookshelf we have my FFXII Potion, still undrunk after all these years, and my FFXII demo disc that came with Dragon Quest VIII (excellent game btw)\n\nFrom the left:\n\nFinal Fantasy XII (game, Bradygame guide, and Bradygames Art Collection mini-book and case)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings (game and Bradygame guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII Limited Edition Original Soundtrack\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: Symphonic Poem \"Hope\"\n\nFinal Fantasy XII world Preview guide (by Square Enix)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII Art Collection (by Bradygames)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII Official Manga, Volumes 1-V (Square Enix, Gin Amou)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: International Zodiac Job System Masterbook (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII Official Guide Book (by Square Enix)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII First Flight Guide (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings First Flight Guide (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings Expert Guide Book (by Famitsu)\n\nRight image, from the left:\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII PS3 version (game and Piggyback guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 PS3 version (game and Collectors Edition Piggyback guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII Official Soundtrack (OST, Visual Arts book, and Episode Zero -Promise- audio disc)\n\nRE: [riplai] - DK Sigma 3713 Event and TGS 2008 book (has promotional and preview stuff for a bunch of SE games featured at the event, notably Fabula Nova Crystallis.

And a CG Judges promotional card that came with the Potion in my wallet. I like it there, a little piece of FF wherever I go.\n\nOkay. Next is....the Tactics-verse! (tomorrow. I'm going to bed)\n\nEDIT: As per my obsessive need for completion, I went ahead and bought the Memorial Albums for FFVII, VIII, IX, and X. I also bought the CLOUD Message book and the blue-covered FFVII Complete. eBay really is heaven for this kind of stuff. Once you know it exists and its name, you can find it there. I'll be buying the Final Fantasy A Go Go thing too. Heck, for 1 Yen, why the hell not? I also bought a PocketStation off eBay for 2 bucks. And the FFXIII and XIII-2 World Preview guides that I was putting off for no particular reason. Yay for poverty-inducing spending sprees!\n\nElectronic Gaming Monthing Limited Edtion FFX issue with original Amano artwork\n\nGoddammit, I was sure I finally had something you didn't! =P I was going to gloat for a little while, then offer to send it to you at no charge just because you're a cool dude and I would feel good about myself helping you complete your Amano collection.\n\nAnd now my plan is ruined!\n\nPerhaps there is still some possibility for bragging rights, though: I bought it off the magazine rack like 12 years ago. Did you get yours at the time of publication or sometime after?\n\nespritduo said:\n\nFinal Fantasy X World Guide - Yevon's Dogma and People on the Spira (by Famitsu.

I bought it.\n\nAnd the FFX World Guide was published by Famitsu. I don't know what's up with it honestly. It's got lots of cool artwork in it on top of the story of various pilgrimages, most notably Braska's, if I am reading it right. Also has details on loads of equipment and monsters (in the section \"Living With Death and Sadness\". I assume they are little background info on the natures and habits of the monsters, or the role of the various equipment in the world of Spira). I'll scan a few interesting pages once I've got my scanner hooked up on my desk again and we'll see what it is we've got here.\n\nOh, and I got my EGM magazines of eBay, where else? Heh. So yeah, you beat me there in the \"legit\" category.\n\nMGS Scenario books\n\nXenosaga Scenario books\n\nAnd here's Final Fantasy Tactics, in all its glory:\n\nOkey-dokey, let's mosey:\n\nLeft image, from the left:\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics (game and Prima guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions (gamex2 and Bradygames guide. I got two copies, as well as two PSP's, so that I could play the ad-hoc optional battles and get all the ad-hoc only equipment. Sounds crazy, but these battles and equipment are the best thing about this version, by far)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance (game and Nintendo Power guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics A2 (game and Bradygames guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics OST\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance OST\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance - The White Album\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics A2 OST\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Character Card Book Volume 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Character Card Book Volume 2\n\nRight image, from the left, bottom row:\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Guide for Beginners (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Official Guide (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Bible (by Famitsu)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Guide (by Digicube)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions Official Complete Guide (by Square-Enix. I basically consider this the FFT Ultimania. It's in the exact same style and layout as an Ultimanias)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions Perfect Guide (by Famitsu)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions Master Guide (by Media Works)\n\nRight image, from the left, top row:\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance Official Perfect Guide (by Famitsu)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance \"Grimoire\" Guidebook (by Digicube)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance Eternal Guide (by Kadokawa Games Collection)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance Ivalice Bible (by Softbank Games)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance for Beginners (by Digicube)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance Creation of Ivalice (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics A2 First Engage Guide (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics A2 Official Complete Guide (by Square Enix)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics A2 Perfect Guide (by Famitsu)\n\n(yes, there are a lot of Tactics Advance guides, for some reason)\n\nAlso, I have Final Fantasy Tactics on the PSN, as well as Crystal Defenders R1 and R2 on the Wii Virtual Console. Also, I forgot to mention I have FFIV:TAY on the Wii as well. I have digital copies of FFT: Diaries of Olan, Final Fantasy Tactics Unreleased Tracks and translated versions of the Final Fantasy Tactics Sound Novels that were egregiously never included in the English version.\n\nUp next, the world of Crystal Chronicles!\n\nBeyond what happens in Tactics Advance 2 (which takes place after Revenant Wings), no, there's nothing about the intervening years between FFXII's Ivalice and FFT's Ivalice. And seeing as the Ivalice Alliance hasn't seen an update in years (damn you for leaving us Matsunooooo~!) I doubt we'll ever know about that time period.\n\nVGMdb can do a better job of explaining Diaries of Olan than I can, but it's bascially a fan-made movie score of FFT. Not official, but it is pretty good and rather well-known as far as these things go.\n\nThe Sound Novels are little choose-your-path stories that were accessed through various Artefacts, but only in the Japanese version. You can find info (as well as a download link to the translated ones) on the FFwiki. Oeilvert is especially good, and sad.\n\nAnd here is Crystal Chronicles!\n\nNot as much here, but still pretty sizable for something like Crystal Chronicles. From the left:\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (game and Nintendo Power guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates (game and Bradygames guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time (game and Bradygames guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearers (game and Bradygames guide)\n\n(back up to the top left)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles OST\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Kazenone Single (by Yae)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time OST\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearers OST and bonus calender (came with the game)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Multiplayer Navigator guide (by Digicube, the book above the Crystal Bearers game/guide)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Beginner's Adventure guide (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles official manga (by 4Koma)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles First Edition Official Guide Book (by Square Enix)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Complete Edition Official Guide Book (by Square Enix)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates Official Perfect Guide (by Famitsu)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates Fortune Guide (by V-Jump)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time Perfect Guide (by Famitsu)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearers Official Complete Guide (by Square Enix)\n\nAnd I also have FFCC: My Life as King and FFCC: My Life as Darklord on the Wii Virtual Console. Everyone should have these games, because they are unfairly overlooked little gems. I also have a digital copy of the Ring of Fates OST.\n\nNext is the miscellaneous FF stuff. Dissidia and Mystic Quest, etc. I should be able to get it all in one spread. Maybe not. We shall see!\n\n^That's pretty cool.
