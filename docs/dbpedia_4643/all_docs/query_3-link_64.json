        "text": "I'm currently replaying Final Fantasy XIII thanks to the fan remaster mods and it made me think back to how FFXIII and FFXV (XIII Versus) started out as being very promising concepts as part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis 'universe' (which Agito / Type-0 also was part of). Both XIII and Versus/XV took wildly different development paths, especially XV that had to be restarted and scrapped from Nomura's 'vision' over to Tabata's much better project management skills, while XIII didn't land on its actual game design until the Advent Children blu-ray demo as far as I recall from interviews.\n\nFrom my impressions of the reception of FFXIII and FFXV, these seem to be the general sentiments:\n\nFFXIII\n\nGorgeous art direction\n\nSuperb soundtrack, possibly the best in the series(?)\n\nImpressive graphics for its era\n\nTrying to modernize ATB combat\n\nUnderwhelming story with important plot points hidden away in the datalog\n\nVery linear level design\n\nFFXV\n\nA large open-world with tons of sidequests and 'content'\n\nVisually impressive action RPG combat\n\nSubpar story that gets off to a rocky start and requires you to watch/read all the transmedia\n\nMultiplayer with the 'Comrades' feature\n\nLots of post-launch support with the Royal Edition fixing some of the worst aspects of the initial launch version\n\nIf there is stuff I overlooked, apologies, my memory about how both games were received and ultimately remembered is a bit hazy. And sorry for not including Type-0 / Agito, but I feel like it was so derided and ultimately became forgotten/ignored, but I can change the poll in case there is a large outcry.\n\nI haven't played 15, but I have played 13. and I'd choose 15 because of that. I hated 13. it was like \"do what 10 did, but do it poorly\"\n\nBasically. FFXV has a lot of problems, but its problems came from it trying to do too much and buckling under the weight of all of it.\n\nFFXIII is one of the dullest ideas the FF series has ever had and both of its sequels had zero reason to exist outside of \"more Lightning\", the least interesting FF protagonist this side of the Onion Knight.\n\nFFXV was incomplete but at least it felt coherent, u literally had to read data logs to understand the metric fuckton of terminology that FFXIII unloads on you. And even then it wouldn't resonate emotionally. You ever think about the ending of FFXIII, see all those characters cheering and happy, and how, you sorta feel nothing because of the clusterfuck that was the climax and how much they kissed the mark when it came to making the beats of the ending resonate? FFXV is the exact opposite. It has a beautifully subdued ending that while unearned, actually can garner a reaction.\n\nAnd that's just the story comparison. FFXIII as a linear semi turned based game was more polished sure but its combat system, pacing or lack thereof, repetition, all led to a dull experience filled with a pretty unlikeable cast of characters who have no personality traits that a person can relate to. Not to mention the lack of chemistry between them. There's literally a story beat where the characters assume that the overall point is to grind.\n\nI could argue FF XV's OST is better than FF XIII's, but I think I'm totally biased on this one.\n\nOverall, FFXV resonated much more with me than XIII did, to the point XV is my favorite FF game ever. The final chapter in XV is perfectly executed and has stayed with me ever since. I self proclamed myself the FFXV Maestro and you can read many of my thoughts on this game here.\n\nI really dislike the hate both games get on this forum though.\n\nBoth games were fucked over by Wada's mismanagement and ended up being rushed but of the two, XIII has a far more coherent vision, fleshed out world, far better told story and amazing combat system. XV on the other hand, ultimately ended up just being another Tabata game. There's some good ideas in there and maybe even a good story (maybe) but it's bogged down by shitty storytelling, a shitty combat system and a bunch of shitty multimedia tie-in's. And to top it all off, XV's female characters were so worthless, they may as well have been cardboard cutouts.\n\nAt least 13 gave the illusion that the story matched the content you played. XV didn't. It's pretty obvious the first part of the game is simply excuses to drive around the huge boring area (oh no the super important butler that had 3 lines of text was murdered but we are pretending he was crucial to the plot for the sake of it). The game felt stitched together rather poorly. I guess XIII at least gave XIII-2 which was fun to play.\n\nEDIT : And wow at the characters leaving for no reason and for it to be relegated to DLC much later down the line. They were really scrambling to ship this.\n\nFFXII for sure, if / when the combat clicks on the later part of the game it can be a blast, music was great, gorgeous maps, it got a sequel fixing what the fans disliked and got a weird spin off with lightning returns, FFXV was terrible at release, combat never did anything for me, it had good music. FFXIII and XV stories were terrible but at least XIII felt more complete and I wasn't scratching my head after every cutscene like with XV, there I thought several times I skipped scenes by mistake.\n\nCan't believe Xiii is winning the poll lol\n\nI don't understand it, legitimately. XIII is such a vapid, empty game. The combat sucked, the characters are all unlikeable pricks except Sazh, the villain is a nobody and any interesting antagonists get wiped off the board to make room for more Barty Pants Pants monologues about fate.\n\nXV has a lot of problems but Ardyn is 1000x the villain Barty could ever hope to be.\n\nXV has many problems but you can connect with the protagonists. Xlll is a finished project but for me it did nothing, didn't connect with characters and didn't bother to understand the story.\n\nI really would like to beat FFXV final edition or whatever it is called and get another perspective because I finished it soon after it came out and never came back but I think I really prefer XV\n\nXIII. As much as people harp on the characters (which tbh I think is way overblown anyway), at least it has thoroughly explored characters. Everyone in XV pretty much got mega shafted in the character development department, and the DLC only kinda fixes it for Ignis and Prompto. I'll admit XIII doesn't always feel super coherent, especially since a lot of the story is hidden away in the datalogs, but you still come out the other end feeling like you experienced a properly explored concept and cast even if a few of the smaller details are a little confusing. XV, on the other hand, you walk away from feeling like entire chunks of the story were left on the table, even after completing the DLC. Plus, XIII has the better music. :3c\n\nThat said, while I do really like XIII's combat and found its world gorgeous (never much had a problem with its linearity, personally), I do think XV's real time combat edges it out for me and its dungeons and party banter are just the best.\n\nXIII is coherent. XV is an unfinished mess (or was, on release).\n\n13 is not coherent. Think a out how that game presents its story, and how it presents it's gameplay systems. FFXV, even with how obviously unfinished it is, does both in a more coherent way. And you need to watch a terrible movie and a mediocre anime to get the full picture. That's how incoherent FF13 is."
