        "text": "Apparently, there's a rumor that Final Fantasy XV might make an appearance on the Wii U. The rumor might get confirmed at E3 2012. It will be the first time since the SNES that the main series will return to a Nintendo console.\n\nIt's plausible, because the Wii U is an HD console and FF recently has been about graphics. I don't see why not; if Nintendo can get some contracts signed then FFXV for the Wii U is definitely possible.\n\nI wouldn't be suprised if this rumor was true. The WiiU is going to be an HD console with graphics just as good (or better) as the Xbox 260 and the PS3. There are aslo rumors of Kingdom Hearts 3 being on the WiiU as well along with many other games.\n\nit's definetly possible. i love the series and i hope it does come out on the WiiU. or project cafe.\n\nThe \"Project Cafe\" that you speak of was the codename for the Wii."
