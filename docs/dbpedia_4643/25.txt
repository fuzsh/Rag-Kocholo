Los Angeles (May 8, 2006)

Today, during its E3 2006 press event, Square Enix, Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan, Square Enix), a leading developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software and service, revealed world-premiere footage of FABULA NOVA CRYSTALLIS - FINAL FANTASY® XIII. This latest project in the multi-platinum FINAL FANTASY series will encompass the simultaneous development of original titles for numerous platforms including the PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system, and mobile phones.

FABULA NOVA CRYSTALLIS, defined in Latin as "the new tale of the crystal," is made up of several different titles based on variations of the FINAL FANTASY XIII universe. However, while each title in the project features different characters, different worlds, and different stories, all are ultimately based on and expand upon a common mythos.

Currently, development for FABULA NOVA CRYSTALLIS entails two titles for the PlayStation 3 system: FINAL FANTASY XIII and FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII. In addition, FINAL FANTASY Agito XIII is also in development for mobile phones. However, the three new titles are only the beginning of the evolution of FABULA NOVA CRYSTALLIS, with more announcements regarding other facets of the project scheduled for the near future.

One myth, countless stories.

This is the concept behind Square Enix's groundbreaking new take on entertainment.
