They're worried about making it through the day-to-day monotony of high school and all the \"stresses\" that come with it.\n\nNot Jaden Decker, though. Decker knew what was on the horizon.\n\nAfter Decker graduated high school earlier this year he knew music was the calling card.\n\n\"This is the first year that I've kind of been able to be free,\" expressed Decker. \"And not be restrained and have to be home by late August, September... It's been real fun, real busy and it's been a great experience. I'm looking forward to what else comes up.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Every Western Montana Fair Food Vendor\n\nAnd free he's been. Twelve hours before Decker showed up in studio for our interview, he returned home from a show in Illinois. It's a significant advancement in his career especially when you think about his humble beginnings.\n\n\"It all started back in 2019, there's a studio here in town called Southwest Studios and I recorded my first song ever there. It was like a $50 recording. No effects, nothing. It took us 10 minutes to cut it... It came out how any other 13-year-old singer's song would. It wasn't good at all.\"\n\nDecker's come a long way from that $50 recording. He embarked on his Movin' On Tour 2024 with stops from Montana and Wyoming to the Eastern Time Zone. After working with a booking agent, Decker will travel to Latrobe, Pennsylvania and Winchester, Virginia in September. Before he heads east, Decker has plenty of stops in and around Montana. His full schedule is on his website. He'll be in Frenchtown on Friday, August 9 and at the Sunrise Saloon in Missoula on Saturday, August 10.\n\nDecker will surely perform his new single Thrown to the Wolves at any of his shows. He explains the origins of the song below.\n\nFor the full interview click the file below."
