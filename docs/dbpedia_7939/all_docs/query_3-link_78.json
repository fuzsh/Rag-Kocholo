        "text": "LOCK HAVEN, Pa. – The Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference today released its 2024 PSAC Football Coaches Preseason Poll. For the third straight year Gannon is picked to finish fourth in the Western Division by the division coaches.\n\nThe previous two years the Golden Knights have exceeded those expectations. Two years ago Gannon finished at 8-3 overall and 6-1 in the PSAC West to finish as division co-champions. The Golden Knights were 5-2 in the PSAC West last year, good for third place in the division, while ending the year at 5-6.\n\nReturning Western Division champion Slippery Rock is the prohibitive favorite in the preseason poll with six first-place votes. SRU finished at 12-2 a year ago. California (Pa.) is second in the poll after posting a 7-3 overall record and 6-1 in Western Division play, good for second place.\n\nIndiana (Pa.) (6-5, 3-4 PSAC West) picked up the remaining first place vote in the 2024 preseason poll after coming in fifth a year ago. Gannon holds down the fourth spot in the poll for the third straight year with Seton Hill (6-5) next after enjoying a 4-3 record in league play.\n\nEdinboro in sixth place and Clarion in seventh round out the Western Division preseason poll.\n\nHead coach Erik Raeburn, entering his fifth season, was philosophical about Gannon's spot in the Western Division poll. \"The PSAC West is always a difficult challenge,\" he noted. \"It's always interesting to see where the other teams rank you but we know the only ranking that matters is the final one.\"\n\nReigning PSAC champion Kutztown is the preseason favorite in the Eastern Division, receiving six of a possible eight first-place votes. The Golden Bears ended 2023 with a 12-3 record, reaching the Division II semifinals. Shepherd and East Stroudsburg are second and third, respectively, with each receiving a first-place vote after finishing at 9-3.\n\nGannon has its work cut out in crossover action, playing at East Stroudsburg on September then hosting Kutztown on September 21.\n\nThe rest of the Eastern Division poll has West Chester fourth, Lock Haven fifth, Millersville sixth, Shippensburg seventh and Bloomsburg in eighth.\n\nTHREE STARTERS RETURN ON OFFENSIVE LINE\n\nGannon returns six starters on offense and will rely on an offensive line that returns three starters despite losing a pair of All-PSAC West performers. Riley Noble (Canonsburg, Pa./Canon-McMillan) was a second team All-PSAC West honoree while started all 11 games at right tackle. The redshirt senior has started 34 games in his career.\n\nIn addition, Jake Vasko (Strongsville, Ohio/Benedictine) returns after started nine games last year, mostly at right guard. The redshirt junior is a two-year starter. In addition, senior Dylan Wilson (Garrettsville, Ohio/Garfield) started the last ten games at right tackle after transferring from Walsh and versatile Eyvar Robles (Auburn, Wash./Auburn Riverside), a graduate student, has started 15 games as a Golden Knight.\n\nDonell \"Tank\" Mason is the top returning skill position player after finishing second on the team in receptions with 40 while leading the team in yards receiving with 613 despite missing two games. Mason was the 2022 PSAC West Freshman of the Year. Mason leads a wide receiving corps that lost several players but was replenished with several experienced transfers.\n\nJayden Whitaker (Brownsburg, Ind./Brownsburg) stepped in at quarterback as a true freshman late in the season and led the Golden Knights to back-to-back last-second wins against Mercyhurst and Indiana (Pa.). Whitaker went down with a season-ending injury the next week vs. California (Pa.). He threw for three touchdowns and ran for two more in two-and-a-half games.\n\nGannon has traditionally enjoyed a strong running game under Raeburn. Donny Marcus (Brownsburg, Ind./Brownsburg) emerged as a second-team All-PSAC West honoree a year ago, falling just short of 1,000 yards with 932 yards. Marcus entered the transfer portal leaving the Golden Knights once again looking for a bell cow back.\n\nThe top candidates are Braxton Tood and David Morgan, Jr. Todd, like Marcus a Division I transfer a year ago, totaled 144 yards while playing in five games before going down with a season-ending injury. Morgan had been little-used during his career but emerged late in the year. The graduate student is the top returning rusher with 147 yards.\n\nDEEP LINEBACKING CORPS PACES DEFENSE\n\nThe defensive side of the ball showcases a strong linebacking corps. Trey Baker (Kettering, Ohio/Kettering Fairmont) finished as the second-leading tackler a year ago with 65 stops, including 8.5 TFL. The redshirt senior has 24 career starts and 175 career tackles. Hayden McDonald (Tigard, Ore./Tigard), another redshirt senior, also started\n\nall 11 games and totaled 61 tackles and 10.5 TFL.\n\nIn addition redshirt sophomore Keoke Toomer (Indianapolis, Ind./Ben Davis) is back after starting the final eight games at linebacker and totaling 40 tackles. He took over for Zharell Walker (Severn, Md./Meade), who went down with a season-ending injury after starting the first two games. The graduate student was the fourth-leading tackler in 2022 with 50 stops.\n\nThe defensive line lost a pair of All-PSAC West performers, including Obi Ezeigbo (Ewing, N.J./Ewing). The team's sack leader a year ago is now playing for Oklahoma State. But as the year went on Charles Calhoun (Euclid, Ohio/St. Edward) merged as a big force on the line. The redshirt junior ended up leading the team with 13.5 TFL while totaling 49 tackles, including 6.5 sacks.\n\nThree-time All-PSAC West honoree Chris Farnsworth (Bristol, Pa./Milton Hershey) will be hard to replace in the secondary. Farnsworth is one of four regulars missing in 2024, but Zaire Allen (Johnson City, Tenn./Archbishop Spalding (Md.)) started eight games at cornerback and recruiting efforts featured a host of defensive backs.\n\nKICKING GAME TO HAVE NEW LOOK\n\nA year ago Eric Scarpino (Waterford, Pa./Fort LeBoeuf) emerged as a consensus All-American while enjoying possibly the finest season ever by a Gannon kicker. He made 16-of-17 field goals, including back-to-back game-winners at Mercyhurst and Indiana (Pa.). Donovan Warren (Santa Cruz, Cal./Santa Cruz County Office of Education), meanwhile, averaged 39.0 yards on 52 punts.\n\nNeither Scarpino nor Warren return, leaving Raeburn to develop the kicking game during training camp.\n\nSEASON KICKS OFF WITH THURSDAY NIGHT SPECIAL HOSTING NORTHWOOD\n\nGannon will kick off the 2024 campaign on Thursday, September 5 hosting Northwood. The non-conference portion of the schedule features PSAC crossover games against NCAA playoff teams East Stroudsburg (Sept. 14) and Kutztown (Sept. 21) before PSAC West gets underway on September 28 with the Golden Knights playing at California (Pa.).\n\n2024 PSAC Football Preseason Polls (First place votes in parentheses)\n\nWESTERN DIVISION\n\n1.
