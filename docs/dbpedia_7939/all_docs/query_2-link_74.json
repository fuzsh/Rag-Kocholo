        "text": "The founding fathers of the PA Turnpike, the original Commissioners, made history by convincing President Franklin D. Roosevelt to grant them federal funding to create America’s First superhighway.\n\nPictured here is Commissioner Charles T. Carpenter, Commissioner Thomas J. Evans, Executive Secretary and General Counsel John D. Faller, Chairman Walter A. Jones, Chief Engineer Samuel W. Marshall, Commissioner Frank Bebout and Secretary of Highways I. Lamont Hughes.\n\nIn a span of 23 months 160-miles of pavement was poured to construct the original Turnpike. The roadway also consisted of:\n\n200 feet of right-a-way\n\n12 foot-wide concrete traffic lanes\n\n10 feet of median strip\n\nA total roadway width of 78 feet\n\nA maximum grade of 3 percent and curvature of 6 degrees\n\nLimited access with 1,200 foot long entrance and exit ramps\n\nYou cannot find cross streets, driveways, traffic signals or railroad crossings anywhere on the PA Turnpike.\n\nCompleting the original tunnels was the most challenging part of the construction of the Turnpike. Six out of seven of the tunnels were already partially constructed by the abandoned South Pennsylvania Railroad project but had not been “holed through.”\n\nWork on the tunnels consisted of drilling, detonating, clearing rubble, reinforcing walls and floors, enlarging and reshaping entrances and exits and more.\n\nOriginally called ticket offices, 11 interchanges were built at Middlesex, Carlisle, Blue Mountain, Willow Hill, Fort Littleton, Breezewood, Bedford, Somerset, Donegal, New Stanton and Irwin. A single ticket office served both Carlisle and Middlesex.\n\nLater renamed Carlisle, as the original Carlisle exit was eventually closed, the construction of the Middlesex ticket office is pictured here.\n\nTen service plazas, located 25 to 30 miles apart, were constructed with the original Turnpike. Allowing customers to rest, eat or buy fuel during their travels, the total cost of the plaza construction was $500,000.\n\nContinued today, the Commission leased the plazas to outside vendors. Originally, Standard Oil Co of PA held the lease and subcontracted the dining areas and gift shops to Howard Johnson’s.\n\nPictured here is South Midway Service Plaza on Memorial Day, 1941.\n\nThe original PA Turnpike construction project gathered thousands of workers to Pennsylvania’s southern tier. By the spring of 1940, 15,000 workers were on the job with contracts awarded to 155 companies or subcontractors from 18 different states. With the country in the depths of the Great Depression the small surge in employment was a great boost to Pennsylvania’s economy.\n\nWhen America entered World War II in 1941 highway travel, like all other facets of American life, was changed greatly.\n\nGasoline rationing was imposed causing passenger vehicle numbers to greatly decrease. With the movement of materials in convoys the number of trucks rose significantly. PA Turnpike engineers and supervisors, who had just built the original Turnpike in only 23 months, went immediately to wartime work building airports and defense installations in the United States and abroad.\n\nOn October 1, 1940, the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened to traffic and ushered in a new era of transportation. The original Turnpike spanned from Middlesex in Cumberland County to Irwin in Westmoreland County and consisted of 160 miles of four-lane-all-concrete highway, seven tunnels, eleven interchanges and ten service plazas. A modern marvel, built in just 23 months.\n\nAs word spread that the Turnpike offered a dream highway experience, thousands of motorists flocked to the highway daily. In its first 12 months, the Turnpike carried 2.4 million vehicles, nearly twice the original projection of 1.3 million.\n\nHere, cars line up to pay their toll exiting the Blue Mountain Interchange opening weekend.\n\nToday, sign colors and verbiage are dictated by state and federal guidelines. But, when the PA Turnpike first opened, engineers had to create a new informative art form.\n\nThe original, black and white highway signs seen along the Turnpike – this one photographed in 1941 one mile from the New Stanton Interchange – used reflective glass beads imbedded in the letters for better nighttime visibility.\n\nIn the early 1950s, speed and crossover collisions were the highest factors for fatalities on the Turnpike. A number of enhancements were made to improve safety including these railroad-like signals placed on the median strip. For a time the speed limit on bridges was 45 mph as shown here.\n\nIn the 40s traffic was light enough on the Turnpike that motorists could stop to picnic on the grassy median strip. After World War II, traffic volumes became so heavy that there were a great number of head-on collisions. Beginning in 1953, the Commission continued to address the safety concerns by installing guard rail, pictured here near Somerset.\n\nTo construct the Turnpike, the Commission had to acquire private properties. St. John the Baptist, in New Baltimore, was one of the many properties that lay in the path. But the church had a cemetery and state law prohibited graveyards from being acquired by eminent domain. As part of an informal mitigation agreement, the church agreed to relocate the graves and allow passage in exchange for a physical connection to the roadway. Steps were built that started on the Turnpike and led up to the church.\n\nWhile the steps are no longer in use, travelers today can still see the church and the stairwell remnants just east of the Allegheny Tunnel.\n\nBuilt by 18 firms under 27 contracts, the Western Extension covers rugged territory, crossing two major rivers and goes from Pittsburgh to Northeast Ohio. The extension was opened in stages, first, from Irwin to Pittsburgh, on August 7, 1951; then to the Gateway interchange at the Ohio line, on December 26, 1951.\n\nThe 1950s was a decade of expansion to the east. Before the Turnpike had even opened to traffic, Act 11 authorized the Turnpike Commission to reach eastward to Philadelphia.\n\nOn November 20, 1950, the Philadelphia Extension opened to traffic and connected a 100-mile segment of Carlisle to Valley Forge. Another monumental event occurred in November of 1957 when the 110-mile Northeastern Extension opened and connected Clarks Summit to Philadelphia.\n\nConstructed and jointly financed with the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the Delaware River Bridge opened on May 23, 1956. With a length of 6,571 feet it is the longest bridge on the Turnpike’s system.\n\nWith the bridge’s opening motorists could now travel between Maine and the Indiana-Ohio border (soon to be extended to Chicago) entirely on limited-access highways.\n\nBy 1960, the Turnpike was preparing to count its 200 millionth vehicle.\n\nTo accommodate traffic growth four tunnels were expanded to four lanes, thanks to the addition of a second tube. Pictured here is the ribbon-cutting event for the Allegheny Tunnel on March 15, 1965.\n\nThe original Turnpike’s longest tunnel, Sideling Hill (6,782 feet) and its shortest, Rays Hill (3,532 feet) had large backups due to congestion. It was determined by engineers that the best way to ease congestion at the single tubes was to abandon those tunnels and channel traffic over a new 13.5 mile-long bypass. A third truck-climbing lane was also added at each end.\n\nThis scenic photo along the Northeastern Extension was used to illustrate a New York Times travel feature about the Turnpike’s 25th anniversary in 1964 stating that the roadway is, “the first of the great modern toll routes, [and] grows older and broader...”\n\nThere is a lot more to running one of the largest and oldest toll road systems than meets the eyes. It takes the skills and talents of many employees to keep customers safe and traffic moving. This early plow shows what the Turnpike is known for – keeping the roadway safe and traffic moving even during the worst conditions.\n\nTechnology and design had come a long way since the original tunnels were built. For motorists, the biggest change in the 60s was the new bright interior look in tunnels, thanks to white-tile walls and fluorescent lighting. The new features were both easier to clean and maintain than the old recessed lighting and concrete lining. Other improvements were a new ventilation system and new portal buildings.\n\nMany families traveled the PA Turnpike strictly for leisure during the early years. After taking in the sights of the tunnels, bridges and scenery, many would stop and picnic along the side of the highway or visit a Howard’s Johnson service plaza to have a sit-down dinner.\n\nThe diverse scenes and settings along the Pennsylvania Turnpike are products of the geographic splendor of our state, its seasonal changes and the remarkable people and places of Pennsylvania. From mountaintops to riverbeds, rural villages to urban centers, you can see it all.\n\nIn December of 1973, a 55-mph restriction was enforced on the Turnpike because of a fuel supply crisis. The total vehicle volume dropped from 57 million in 1973 to 55 million in 1974 and 1975 before edging back up to 57 million in 1976.\n\nThe Turnpike marked the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 with construction of a 320-space park and ride lot for eastbound motorists at the Valley Forge Service Plaza. Tourists could park and catch a 10-minute shuttle bus to the Valley Forge National Military Park. Signs were placed at every toll booth celebrating the “Spirit of 76.”\n\nIn the 1970s the Turnpike had become such an integral part of Pennsylvania life that it surfaced in advertising and pop culture. A tire maker manufactured and marketed Pennsylvania Turnpike tires. A rock group, based near Harrisburg, named itself The Pennsylvania Turnpike. Later, radio stations began playing a country tune titled “Pennsylvania Turnpike I love You.”\n\nHere are ribbons of traffic taken at night from an overhead bridge on Route 283, showing the approach lanes at the Harrisburg East Interchange in Dauphin County. In the 80s customers knew the exit as number 19, but it has since been changed to exit 247 to incorporate the new interstate milepost renumbering system in 2000.\n\nBy the mid-1980s the fast-food trend was well-established, and a new look came to all of the service plazas. Fast food dining and drive-through windows, at some locations, replaced the cozy, sit-down atmosphere of the original Howard Johnson’s Turnpike restaurants.\n\nPictured here is the Hempfield Service Plaza, in Westmoreland County, which was modified with a popular fast-food concept. It was later closed in 2007 as part of a roadway reconstruction project.\n\nThe Lehigh Tunnel broke ground in February 1989 eliminating the last remaining stretch of two-lane roadway on the Turnpike. This project was the first highway construction project in the U.S. to use the New Austrian tunneling method (NATM). NATM takes advantage of strength available in the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel.\n\nShown here are workers meeting in the middle after mining from the northside of the mountain, in Carbon County, and the southside, Lehigh County, on June 13, 1990.\n\nIn 1980 the Turnpike saw 63 million motorists travel its system. the figure rose to 97.4 million by 1989. The average daily traffic count of 270,000 in 1989 was 75 times the level predicted for the original Middlesex-Irwin Turnpike before it opened in 1940. Traffic volume reached a ceremonial milestone on October 31, 1989, when the commission welcomed its two-billionth traveler.\n\nThe first Act 61 construction work, which allowed the Commission to pursue new projects, was a $120 million six-lane widening of the main line near Philadelphia. On March 10, 1986, work began on a 17-mile stretch between the Philadelphia Interchange and the Northeastern Extension junction. It was opened on November 23, 1987.\n\nComputerization of the toll collection system went into effect in 1987. The new system weighed vehicles, both at entry and exit, to calculate the fare. All tickets were dispensed automatically at the tollbooths and contained a magnetic strip encoded with fare and vehicle information.\n\nTo adjust to the increase in traffic, a southbound side of the Lehigh Tunnel was completed in 1991. This eliminated the final two-lane section on the entire Turnpike system. For the opening ceremonies, Governor Robert P. Casey rode a 1909 Peerless automobile through the tunnel.\n\nAdministrative growth prompted a need for more room for Turnpike employees. The central office staff outgrew the space in the administration building at Highspire, just off the Harrisburg East Interchange. To cope with the need for larger quarters, the Commission leased space in a nearby hotel and placed modular offices on the property. A gutting and refurbishing project of the administration building began in September 1999.\n\nThe volume of cars and trucks rose to 121 million a year by the mid-1990s, up from 100 million at the beginning of the decade. The 90s became a decade of expansion to accommodate the increased traffic.\n\nWhile the 90s brought growth and expansion in construction to the PA Turnpike, it also became a decade of lasting innovations. In 1993, the Commission began to coordinate with several other toll roads to begin electronic toll collection — permitting travel without stopping at a tollbooth. 27 years later the entire PA Turnpike converted to All-Electronic Tolling.\n\nThe Traffic Operations Center, originally located, and pictured here, in the Central Administration Building is an emergency 911 dispatch and traffic management center. Duty officers handle a wide variety of calls relating to incidents on the roadway and dispatch fire, emergency medical services, State Police, tow trucks and Hazardous Materials Response Teams for customers in need.\n\nBy the 2000 decade, the original 160-mile PA Turnpike was expanded to 514 miles, carrying 156.2 million vehicle a year at a toll of just over 4.1 cents per mile.\n\nMany changes occurred in 2000 including the renumbering of the original exits to coincide with the mile marker of their location.\n\nOn December 2, 2000, the Turnpike launched E-ZPass electronic toll collection for passenger vehicles, only between exits 18 and 33. During this trial period 30,000 passenger vehicles were pre-enrolled and more than 55.6 million transactions occurred through E-ZPass within the first year. The system went statewide in 2001 and commercial vehicles were included in 2002.\n\nToday, eight out of every 10 transactions on the Turnpike are paid through an E-ZPass.\n\nOn June 1, 2003, the Warrendale Interchange opened to traffic. This 13-lane mainline plaza became the new western limit for the ticket system.\n\nThe new plaza had the first PA Turnpike express E-ZPass lanes, which allowed motorists to pay their tolls while continuing to drive at 55 mph. Included in the construction was a direct connector to I-79 which helped to eliminate some of the congestion on State Route 19 in a quickly growing area of Cranberry Twp., PA.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, Oakmont Plum became the first travel plaza on the Turnpike system to be completely rebuilt as part of a service plaza redevelopment plan. With the constant increase in traffic, the plazas were no longer efficiently serving the needs of travelers. Under the plan, the service plazas were revitalized with larger buildings, more varied food options, outdoor dining areas and more.\n\nOpened to traffic on May 16, 2007, the Susquehanna River Bridge was the state's first major, segmental-concrete bridge. The six lane, 1.1 mile-long bridge replaced a 4-lane structure from the 1950s.\n\nBefore traffic crossed the bridge, the Commission held a community-fun day. A Once & Done Turnpike Run allowed pedestrians the chance to walk or run on the bridge before any cars.\n\nTurnpike signage has played a large part in keeping the traveling public aware of important information such as closures and inclement weather. In the 2010s the Go Orange campaign was launched to promote driving safely through work zones. Signage now warned motorists when they were approaching a work zone so that they had plenty of time to slow down.\n\nThe Mon/Fayette Expressway is a culmination of more than 30 years of work. On August 2, 2012 Phase 2 of the Uniontown to Brownville Project opened to traffic completing nearly 60-miles of the expressway system. In April 2013 the Turnpike dedicated the 3,022 foot long, 200 foot high Mon River bridge to fallen Vietnam War Pfc. Ronald C. “Smokey” Bakewell.\n\nIn an effort to shorten commute times, lighten rush-hour volumes at neighboring Turnpike interchanges and reduce congestion improving safety and accessibility across the region, slip ramps were added. The Route 29 slip ramp was the first four way, all access interchange added to the turnpike system in 2012.\n\nIn January of 2020, the Pennsylvania Traffic Incident Management Enhancement (PennTIME) program celebrated its third anniversary. PennTIME is a partnership of federal, state, county and municipal agencies who have joined forces to educate both first responders and the public while developing programs to promote stronger traffic incident management (TIM) safety practices at roadway incidents in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn its first three years, PennTIME has conducted 251 TIM Training classes statewide training over 6,000 emergency responders.\n\nDue to the novel coronavirus pandemic, on March 16, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf mandated all counties in Pennsylvania to follow a stay-at-home order, restricting all non-essential outings, in the Commonwealth. For safety reasons, the PA Turnpike was forced to move to an All-Electronic Tolling system and close all dining and public restrooms inside service plazas.\n\nPlazas were quickly reopened on March 19 for the many truckers continuing to work and delivering supplies during the pandemic. While most services were still limited, indoor restroom facilities, convenience stores and some dining options were reopened.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak passenger traffic dropped due to stay-at-home measures but commercial traffic remained steady. The first week of March 2020 traffic totals were 3.8 million. By the second week of April traffic had dropped below 1.5 million a week.\n\nDuring the statewide stay-at-home order, Governor Wolf ordered construction projects to be put on hold across the state, to stop the spread of the virus. March 30, 2020 projects were given the go ahead as long as precautions were followed on the job sites.\n\nWork on the monumental project, the Southern Beltway, located in Allegheny and Washington counties, restarted at the beginning of May.\n\nOn June 2, 2020 a unanimous decision was made by the Commissioners to keep All-Electronic Tolling (AET) in place permanently. Originally the conversion was scheduled for the fall of 2021, but with the uncertainties of what will occur during the ongoing pandemic, AET is a safer option. Here a Digital Message Sign is alerting motorists that AET is in place at all toll plazas.\n\nWith the switch to All-Electronic Tolling, a new era of innovation was ushered in on the PA Turnpike. At every interchange customers now have two payment options. If they are not an E-ZPass customer, overhead cameras capture a picture of their license plate when entering and exiting the system. They are sent a TOLL BY PLATE invoice in the mail.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Turnpike partnered with Penn State University to commence site planning and design for the Pennsylvania Safety, Transportation and Research Track, (PennSTART) a state-of-the-art facility envisioned to benefit emergency responders, transportation organizations and research institutions.\n\nThe facility is anticipated to be operational in the near future and will benefit emergency responders, transportation organizations, and research institutions.\n\n2020 became a milestone year for work zone safety. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Turnpike implemented a statewide Automated Work Zone Speed Enforcement (AWZSE) program to improve work zone safety for workers and motorists.\n\nAWZSE uses portable systems to detect and record vehicles exceeding work zone posted speed limits by 11 miles per hour or more using electronic speed timing devices."
