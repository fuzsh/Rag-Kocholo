        "text": "2011\n\nFallingwater’s 75th anniversary is celebrated throughout 2011, honoring the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright and the Kaufmann family who commissioned the project.\n\nWPC acquires high-priority land in the Ligonier Valley that includes several small wetlands and 1,900 feet of frontage along Loyalhanna Creek, a long-term conservation priority for WPC.\n\nIn what has become a new tradition, volunteers and WPC staff welcome spring by planting flowers throughout downtown Pittsburgh in 400 large, potted planters. By late May, flowers bloom in in 140 community gardens in 20 Western Pennsylvania counties, thanks to thousands of volunteers.\n\nWPC scientists identify the Allegheny Front as a top conservation priority. The mountainous region, which spans 160 miles from the Maryland border to Williamsport, serves as a connecting corridor for biodiversity, including migrating birds such as the golden eagle.\n\nBuilding upon its longstanding focus on the Ligonier Valley, WPC protects two farms as well as property owned by the Ligonier Camp and Conference Center in Ligonier Township, Westmoreland County. The farms easements are acquired in collaboration with the Westmoreland County Agricultural Lands Preservation Board, which will assume stewardship responsibilities for the easements.\n\nFollowing PA Governor Tom Corbett’s decision to implement the recommendations from the Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission, WPC, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Pennsylvania Environmental Council, and the PA chapter of the Nature Conservancy urge that the Commonwealth moves quickly to improve oversight and management of Marcellus development, including preventing surface impacts from future state forest land leasing.\n\nA symposium featuring contributors to the new book edited by Fallingwater Director Lynda Waggoner, called “Fallingwater,” is held in June at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh as one of Fallingwater’s 75th anniversary events.\n\nMore than 272 acres of undeveloped forested land in Donegal Township, Westmoreland County, are protected by the Conservancy. The property was protected under a conservation easement that will provide Randall Reserve, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the area’s natural features, funding to continue to protect it as a public natural area.\n\nA new exhibition in honor of the 75th anniversary, “Kaufmanns: Pittsburgh’s Purveyor of Culture,” regarding at the Kaufmann family and its landmark department store, opens at Fallingwater’s Visitors Center.\n\nIn conjunction with Grow Pittsburgh, WPC announces City Growers, a new program to assist local groups interested in starting community vegetable gardens within the city of Pittsburgh. Grow Pittsburgh and WPC staff will assist in all phases of garden construction and planting.\n\nUpdated inventories are completed for Delaware, Pike and Butler counties. Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program scientists update 971 existing records of rare animals and plants, and document 848 new locations of rare plants and animals.\n\nIn September, a 75th Anniversary Gala caps the Fallingwater celebrations. Guests enjoy cocktails and hors d’oeuvres at the fabled house, with a gourmet dinner under a clear tent set in an illuminated meadow nearby. A dazzling light and sound show, using Fallingwater as backdrop, is the evening’s highlight.\n\nWPC acquires 82 forested acres near the bluffs of the Lake Erie shoreline. The property, which will be added to the David M. Roderick Wildlife Reserve, contains a wetland forest with rare plant and animal species, and an ideal habitat for birds including the bald eagle, peregrine falcon, and scarlet tanager.\n\nWPC watershed conservation scientists continue research on the eastern hellbender, focusing their efforts on the Allegheny National Forest. Scientists find the salamanders in eight streams where they were unknown before.\n\nAt the end of the year, WPC announces the protection of 1,600 forested acres on Evitts Mountain in Bedford County. The acquisition creates a linkage of protected lands from Rocky Gap State Park in Maryland to Pennsylvania’s Buchanan Forest.\n\n2012\n\nIn January, WPC notes the passing of Joshua C. Whetzel Jr., who served as the Conservancy’s president and CEO from 1969 to 1978 and later as board chairman, and a visionary leader in land and water conservation. During his tenure, Whetzel challenged the Conservancy to purchase and conserve large landscapes, an uncommon practice for land conservation organizations in the 1970s. He also advocated for protected lands to be accessible to the public for recreation.\n\nWPC purchases 55 acres in Venango County to permanently protect the habitat of the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, a state-endangered species. The property also has natural habitat that is ideal for many other wildlife species, including songbirds.\n\nA 77-acre Erie County property that includes more than 2,700 feet of frontage on the West Branch of French Creek is permanently conserved, adding to over 3,700 acres WPC has already protected along French Creek. Later in the year, WPC acquires 283 acres along Cussewago Creek in Crawford County, a major French Creek tributary.\n\nWPC and partner organizations continue to document new hellbender populations. During 500 hours of sampling, 78 hellbenders are captured, processed, then released. Initial reports indicate that a healthy, well-balanced hellbender population, including juveniles, sub-adults and mature adults, occurs only in Tionesta Creek.\n\nWPC achieves accreditation from the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, an independent program of the Land Trust Alliance. Accreditation demonstrates WPC’s compliance with national quality standards and recognizes its sound finances, ethical conduct, responsible governance and lasting stewardship of protected lands.\n\nWPC, with support from Duquesne Light Company, installs a vertical garden on the side of a building in downtown Pittsburgh’s cultural district. The trellis-style garden wall will help to shade the building in summer and reduce winter wind chill.\n\nTreeVitalize Pittsburghcelebrates the planting of its 15,000th tree since its inception in 2008. The initiative, under WPC management, has a goal of planting 20,000 trees by the end of 2013. TreeVitalize Pittsburgh is a joint project of Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh, Tree Pittsburgh, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and WPC.\n\nStaff botanists complete a study of rare plants. Ninety surveys were conducted, resulting in 75 new and updated rare plant records.\n\nWPC participates in a 12-state effort to monitor the population of the threatened wood turtle. A long-term monitoring site is established in Centre County, which will allow staff and volunteers to study the turtle population over time.\n\nThrough an agricultural easement, WPC protects more than 37 acres of farmland at the headwaters of Tubmill Creek in Fairfield Township, Westmoreland County. The watershed is a conservation priority because of its rich aquatic life.\n\n2013\n\nAs part of its decades-long effort to protect the French Creek watershed, WPC acquires over four acres along the creek in Venango, Crawford County.\n\nAbout 100 acres are added to Buchanan State Forest, resulting in better public access to the forest’s Sweet Root Natural Area. The land in southern Bedford County links two a smaller area that contains parking, a picnic area and a trailhead. The acquisition of this property will result in the protection of valuable ecological resources.\n\nThrough a conservation easement, WPC permanently protects more than 131 acres in the Laurel Highlands. This large open space sits near seven farms that were already protected by easements, and includes land along Loyalhanna Creek.\n\nOn Earth Day, TreeVitalize Pittsburgh volunteers planted the 500th tree in Wilkinsburg. It’s part of the TreeVitalize goal of planting 20,000 trees throughout the greater Pittsburgh area by the end of 2013--; which is reached in November.\n\nThe watershed conservation staff planted more than 15,000 seedlings throughout Western Pennsylvania. Ultimately, the project will result in planting 20,000 native trees and shrubs to create riparian buffers.\n\nOpera Theater of Pittsburgh performs the American Opera “Shining Brow” on the terraces of Fallingwater for two memorable nights in June. The piece focuses on tumultuous times in the life of Fallingwater architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and is presented on the 146th anniversary of his birth.\n\nWPC reaches a land conservation milestone when it completes a conservation easement on a family farm in Donegal Township. This brings the total land the Conservancy has permanently protected in the Ligonier Valley to over 10,000 acres through voluntary conservation easements since the 1970s.\n\nWPC initiates a comprehensive multiyear project to evaluate the condition of Pennsylvania’s rare plant and animal habitats in areas with potential Marcellus and Utica Shale drilling. Field researchers establish 80 sites for long-term monitoring of shale drilling sites. More than 60 percent of important habitats in the state, containing nearly 500 threatened and endangered species, are in shale gas regions.\n\nWith the help of the Erie mayor’s office and its downtown partnership, WPC takes its tree-planting efforts north, planting about a half dozen swamp white oaks in downtown Erie. In 2014, WPC plans to plant 32 more trees in the city.\n\nIn late November, the Fallingwater Museum Store opens a “pop-up” holiday boutique in downtown Pittsburgh. It features gift items from the onsite store, including Frank Lloyd Wright Signature Products such as clocks, vases, and stained glass. The store is open until the end of the year.\n\nA culvert replacement project in the Allegheny National Forest, which began in 2012, continues. The project opens more than eight miles of the upper reaches of the watershed to fish and other organisms that previously were unable to access those areas. Post-project fish surveys show five times more trout present in these stream stretches after the culvert replacements.\n\nWPC purchases two properties totaling 145 acres along the Great Allegheny Passage in Somerset County. The acquisitions enhance the hiking and biking trail that the Conservancy helped create more than 35 years ago and provide access to the nearby Casselman River.\n\nIn 2013, the Conservancy also acquired or protected more than 330 acres of woodland, wetland and bird conservation area in Erie and Westmoreland counties.\n\n2014\n\nAs part of its ongoing effort to protect French Creek, WPC purchases a 60-acre property in LeBoeuf Township, Erie County. The land provides a forested buffer for the biologically diverse stream, considered one of the most ecologically significant in the northeastern United States.\n\nWPC permanently protects 54 acres of forested wetland in Springfield Township, Erie County, adjacent to the David M. Roderick Nature Reserve. The area includes a habitat for rare dragonflies, and a state Important Bird Area. The land will be added to a State Game Land.\n\nFallingwater invites high school students and K-12 educators to apply for its one-week summer residency programs. Students participate in camps focusing on architecture, environment, and design in the context of Fallingwater. Teachers learn how architecture and design can help students gain 21st century critical thinking skills.\n\nRoughly 466 acres of forested slopes and riverside land in Chapman and Grugan townships, Clinton County, are protected by WPC’s acquisition and conveyance to the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Bureau of Forestry. A portion of the land stretches along the West Branch, the largest tributary system of the Susquehanna River.\n\nThe Conservancy wins a Challenge Award grant from the U.S. Forest Service for its work conducting freshwater mussel surveys in the Clarion River and other major tributaries in the Allegheny Forest. By the end of summer, 16 sites in the river and five in the Kinzua Reservoir are completed; three species of freshwater mussels are documented.\n\nAt Presque Isle State Park, Erie County, WPC scientists continue to monitor the Piping plover, a federally listed shore bird. It’s one of many species being monitored to determine if they are affected by climate change, energy development, or other factors.\n\nWPC welcomes springtime to the city by hosting its second annual bulb giveaway at the farmers’ market in downtown Pittsburgh’s Market Square. In 2013, the Conservancy gave away thousands of recycled tulip and daffodil bulbs in 40 minutes. Later in the spring, WPC staff hangs more than 400 flower baskets throughout downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nStaff and volunteers from WPC, Grow Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania American Water plant fruit trees and berry bushes adjacent to a community vegetable garden in Mt. Oliver Borough.\n\nFallingwater welcomes two authors of very different books to book signings. Western Pennsylvania legend Dan Rooney, chairman of the Pittsburgh Steelers and North Side native, along with co-author Carol Peterson, signs copies of “Allegheny City: a History of Pittsburgh’s North Side.” Later in the year, author and architect Steven Reiss signs copies of his book “Frank Lloyd Wright’s Pope-Leighey House,” a detailed story of one of Wright’s innovative Usonian-style houses.\n\n2015\n\nMore than 17,000 acres of forestland and waterways in Norwich and Sergeant townships, McKean County are permanently conserved as intact working forest, making this protection the single largest land acquisition in WPC’s 83-year history. It is also the largest land addition to the state forest system in 65 years, significantly increasing the amount of state forestland available for hunting, fishing, hiking and other recreational activities.\n\nTen buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, including Fallingwater, are nominated by the United States to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List. They are the first works of modern American architecture to be nominated.\n\nWPC conveys almost 1,000 acres in Wharton Township, Fayette County, to the state, for addition to Forbes State Forest. The property serves as a connecter between the state forest and the Fort Necessity Battlefield.\n\nWorking with several partnering agencies, WPC moved thousands of federally listed, threatened and endangered freshwater mussel species, as well as common mussels, from the direct impact zone of the Hunter Station Bridge replacement on the Allegheny River near President, Pa. Of the common mussels, 402 individual mussels of eight species were relocated into 10 sites in the Clarion River.\n\nDue to popular demand, Fallingwater’s annual Fayette County Appreciation Day becomes a twice-yearly event, with free admission offered to county residents in March, along with the traditional November Day. In 2014, almost 1,000 people visited on the appreciation day.\n\nSlippery Rock’s North Country Brewing Company of creates Ryeparian Rye Pale Ale, and designates five percent of sales revenue to support WPC’s tree-planting efforts along Western Pennsylvania’s stream banks, also known as riparian zones.\n\nWPC permanently protects 39 acres adjacent to its 202-acre Wolf Creek Narrows Natural Area in Slippery Rock Township, Butler County. It’s the fifth addition to Wolf Creek Narrows since its original acquisition in 1979.\n\nStaff conduct vernal pool surveys to help landowners monitor the health and state of these important breeding sites for amphibians.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program begins an in-depth survey of Bedford County. Habitats for two state endangered plant species, the tall larkspur and canby’s mountain lover, are of special interest. Both rely on a naturally restricted, limestone-rich habitat.\n\nLandowners Richard and Miriam Williams amend an existing conservation easement, originally donated to WPC in 2009, to include an additional 146 acres atop Jacks Mountain in Granville Township, Mifflin County. The area, a valuable habitat for timber rattlesnakes, forest interior birds, and black bears, now spans 339 acres.\n\nThe death of philanthropist Elsie Hillman on August 4 is noted by the Conservancy. Mrs. Hillman and the Hillman Foundation are longtime supporters of the Conservancy.
