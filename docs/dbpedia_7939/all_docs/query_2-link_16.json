        "text": "Also known as: Eastern Time (ET) and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)\n\nCaution: This is NOT the current local time in most locations in that time zone\n\nNorth America, Caribbean: Only some locations are currently on EST because most places in this time zone are currently on summer time / daylight saving time and are observing EDT.\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This time zone is in use during standard time in: North America, Caribbean, Central America.\n\nSee full time zone map\n\nWhat Is Eastern Standard Time?\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) is the easternmost time zone in the United States. It is also used in Canada.\n\nIt covers all or parts of 23 states in the US and three provinces or territories in Canada. It is also used in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America.\n\nAlmost half of the population in the USA live in the EST time zone. It spans from northern Canada and south to Panama near the equator.\n\nIn North America, Eastern Standard Time shares a border with Atlantic Standard Time (AST) in the east and with Central Standard Time (CST) in the west.\n\nEastern Standard Time Zone\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) is a standard time zone in use from the first Sunday in November to the second Sunday in March—when Daylight Saving Time (DST) is not in effect. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is used during the remainder of the year.\n\nEST Is the Eastern Time Zone\n\nIn everyday usage, EST is often referred to as Eastern Time (ET) or the Eastern Time Zone. This can add a bit of confusion as the term Eastern Time does not differentiate between standard time and Daylight Saving Time, so Eastern Time switches between EST and EDT in areas that use DST during part of the year.\n\nMost North American time zones also have generic terms, including Pacific Time (PT), Mountain Time (MT), Central Time (CT), and Atlantic Time (AT).\n\nConverting Eastern Time to Other US Time Zones\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) is 1 hour ahead of Central Standard Time (CST).\n\nTo convert EST to CST, you have to subtract one hour.\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) is 2 hours ahead of Mountain Standard Time (MST).\n\nTo convert EST to MST, you have to subtract two hours.\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) is 3 hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time (PST).\n\nTo convert EST to PST, you have to subtract three hours.\n\nTime Zone Converter: UTC to EST\n\nWhere and When is EST Observed?\n\nNorth America\n\nUS states using EST in the winter and EDT in the summer:\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nFlorida - Southern/Eastern parts Show\n\nexcept Bay, Calhoun, Escambia, Holmes, Jackson, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Walton and Washington counties and norther Gulf county - look in CST/CDT\n\nGeorgia\n\nIndiana - all except for these north-western counties near Chicago (Lake, Porter, La Porte, Newton, Jasper, Starke) and these south-western counties in Indiana near Evansville Show\n\nGibson, Posey, Vanderburgh, Warrick, Perry\n\nKentucky - eastern parts Show\n\ncounties of Anderson, Bath, Bell, Boone, Bourbon, Boyd, Boyle, Bracken, Breathitt, Bullitt, Campbell, Carroll, Carter, Casey, Clark, Clay, Elliott, Estill, Fayette, Fleming, Floyd, Franklin, Gallatin, Garrard, Grant, Greenup, Hancock, Hansock, Hardin, Harlan, Harrison, Henry, Jackson, Jefferson, Jessamine, Johnson, Kenton, Knott, Knox, Larue, Laurel, Lawrence, Lee, Leslie, Letcher, Lewis, Lincoln, Madison, Magoffin, Marion, Martin, Mason, McCreary, Meade, Menifee, Mercer, Montgomery, Morgan, Nelson, Nicholas, Oldham, Owen, Owsley, Pendleton, Perry, Pike, Powell, Pulaski, Robertson, Rockcastle, Rowan, Scott, Shelby, Spencer, Taylor, Trimble, Washington, Wayne, Whitley, Wolfe, Woodford\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMichigan - most except these western counties Show\n\nDickinson, Gogebic, Iron, and Menominee - which are on CST/CDT\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew York\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOhio\n\nPennsylvania\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTennessee - eastern counties Show\n\nAnderson, Blount, Bradley, Campbell, Carter, Claiborne, Cocke, Grainger, Greene, Hamblen, Hamilton, Hancock, Hawkins, Jefferson, Johnson, Knox, Loudon, McMinn, Meigs, Monroe, Morgan, Polk, Rhea, Roane, Scott, Sevier, Sullivan, Unicoi, Union, and Washington\n\nVermont\n\nVirginia\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCanadian provinces/territories using EST in the winter and EDT in the summer:\n\nNunavut - most of it Show\n\nexcept Kugluktuk, Cambridge Bay - CST/CDT and Southampton Island (Coral Harbor) EST all year\n\nOntario - most parts east of 90 West and two communities west of 90 West Show\n\nShebandowan, Upsala\n\nQuebec - most of it Show\n\nexcept East of 63 West, Blanc Sablon which observe AST all year\n\nCanadian provinces/territories using EST all year:\n\nNunavut - Southampton Island only (Coral Harbour)\n\nMexican states using EST all year:\n\nQuintana Roo\n\nCaribbean\n\nCaribbean countries using EST in the winter and EDT in the summer:\n\nBahamas\n\nHaiti\n\nCaribbean countries using EST all year:\n\nCayman Islands\n\nJamaica\n\nCentral America\n\nCentral American countries using EST all year:\n\nPanama\n\nOther Eastern Standard Time Zones\n\nTime zones can have similar names and abbreviations but have a different UTC offset:\n\nAustralian Eastern Standard Time (AEST): UTC +10\n\nEastern Africa Time (EAT): UTC +3\n\nEastern European Time (EET): UTC +2\n\nEast Greenland Time (EGT): UTC -1\n\nOther Time Zones in UTC -5\n\nSome time zones exist that have the same offset as EST, but can be found under a different name:\n\nACT – Acre Time\n\nCDT – Central Daylight Time\n\nCIST – Cayman Islands Standard Time\n\nCOT – Colombia Time\n\nCST – Cuba Standard Time\n\nEASST – Easter Island Summer Time\n\nECT – Ecuador Time\n\nPET – Peru Time\n\nR – Romeo Time Zone"
