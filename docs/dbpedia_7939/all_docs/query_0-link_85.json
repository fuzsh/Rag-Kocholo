        "text": "The remains of Tropical Storm Debby will crawl up the East Coast over the next several days, bringing heavy downpours and storms to parts of our area.\n\nThe latest models show the bulk of Debby scrapping by our area to the west, so many places will avoid a direct hit from the storm system.\n\nStill, Debby's presence will be felt from Wednesday night through Friday, when forecasters expect tropical rain and that could lead to localized flash flooding.\n\nMost places across the Philadelphia-area were waterlogged overnight Tuesday from a passing cluster of storms that dumped buckets of rain.\n\nWhere is Tropical Storm Debby\n\nThe slow-moving storm first made landfall along Floridaâ€™s Big Bend region on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and slowly made its way to the northeast, dropping historic amounts of rain across the region.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, forecasters tracked Tropical Storm Debby just off the coast of South Carolina near Charleston and Myrtle Beach. It's expected to curl inland before heading north through North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland before reaching our area as a Tropical Depression by Friday.\n\nDebby projected path\n\nThe latest model from FOX Weather shows Debby's direct path missing the Philadelphia-area, but we're still within the margin for error.\n\nAreas far west of Philadelphia will likely bare the brunt of Debby, but the storm's reach is expected to impact Philadelphia and surrounding areas.\n\nThe National Weather Service expects Debby to downgrade to a Tropical Depression by the time it reaches the mid-atlantic region.\n\nDebby storm path timeline\n\nThe FOX Forecast Center said that on Friday, Debby, which will be quickly transitioning from a tropical storm to a post-tropical storm will begin to push through interior portions of the Northeast.\n\n\"Heavy tropical rain related to Debby will be in the area in a couple of days,\" Woods said in a post on X, formally Twitter.\n\nThe extreme amounts of tropical moisture still being produced by the storm, combined with a dip in the jet stream off to the west, are expected to produce heavy precipitation throughout the interior Northeast.\n\nPhilly weather this week: Impacts for the Philadelphia area\n\nMost of the Delaware Valley is getting a brief moment of relief Wednesday morning after Tuesday night's torrential downpour.\n\nHowever, a stalled front system is keeping rain, clouds and cooler weather in the forecast for most of Wednesday.\n\nPop-up showers are possible throughout the day, with chances of scattered showers increasing overnight into Thursday.\n\nFOX 29's Sue Serio says the region will start to feel the impacts of Tropical Storm Debby by Friday.\n\nTropical rain could linger into Saturday morning and should give way to sunshine for part of the daylight hours and again on Sunday.\n\nPhilly hourly weather forecast"
