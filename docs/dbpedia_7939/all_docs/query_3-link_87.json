        "text": "Donald Trump spent much of Sunday on the phone with friends, news hosts and local and foreign officials the day after he was injured in an assassination attempt.\n\nOhio Pastor Darrell Scott, a longtime ally, said Trump “was in great spirits” when they spoke Sunday morning, hours after the shooting.\n\n“He was great, like he always is. He didn’t even make a big deal of it,” Scott said. “He was actually trying to downplay it somewhat, asking how I was doing.”\n\nFormer RNC chair Reince Priebus, who also served as Trump’s White House chief of staff, told ABC’s “This Week” that Trump was “grateful for the miracle of what happened, in his case. ... One quarter inch turned the other direction and we’re obviously talking about something very different this morning.”\n\nTony Perkins, among the most influential Christian conservatives in the Republican Party, was preparing to mount a confrontation with convention planners over his disdain for how debate during the RNC’s platform committee was shut down on Monday, all but eliminating objections to the Trump campaign’s desire to soften language on abortion.\n\nThe attempted assassination changed all that, Perkins told The Associated Press after a prayer service in suburban Milwaukee Sunday evening.\n\n“We live in a violent society. And we run the risk of becoming callous to it. And if we become callous to it, we’re going to have more of it,” Perkins said. “I’m hoping and praying it’s a wake-up call in many ways.”\n\n“So, as a result, I’m stepping back from forcing the issue on the platform,” he added. “More divisiveness would not be healthy.”\n\nPerkins called social media “a contagion” for toxic rhetoric passed along by people who do not feel that they’re heard by their government or leaders, and attributed the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in part to the notion of overheated online rage.\n\n“We need to stop,” he said.\n\nAnd while thanking God during the service for Trump’s survival, Perkins told more than 100 in the Pewaukee church, “Lord, I believe that our nation is at such a volatile moment that yesterday could have torn this nation right in half.”\n\nThe 20-year-old man who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump first came to law enforcement’s attention at Saturday’s rally when spectators noticed him acting strangely outside the campaign event. The tip sparked a frantic search, but officers were unable to find him before he managed to get on a roof, where he opened fire.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting that killed one spectator, investigators are hunting for any clues about what may have drove Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, to carry out the shocking attack. The FBI said they were investigating it as a potential act of domestic terrorism, but the absence of a clear ideological motive by the man shot dead by Secret Service allowed conspiracy theories to flourish.\n\nThe FBI said it believes Crooks, who had bomb-making materials in the car he drove to the rally, acted alone. Investigators have found no threatening comments on social media accounts or ideological positions that could help explain what led him to target Trump.\n\nCrooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. His senior year, Crooks was among several students given an award for math and science, according to a Tribune-Review story at the time.\n\nHe tried out for the school’s rifle team but was turned away because he was a bad shooter, said Frederick Mach, a current captain of the team who was a few years behind Crooks at the school.\n\nJason Kohler, who said he attended the same high school but did not share any classes with Crooks, said Crooks was bullied at school and sat alone at lunch time. Other students mocked him for the clothes he wore, which included hunting outfits, Kohler said.\n\n▶ Read more about what’s known about the shooter\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told The Washington Examiner that he has rewritten the speech he was set to deliver at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday after being the target of an attempted assassination at his rally Saturday.\n\n“The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” he told the news outlet in an article posted Sunday evening.\n\nIn the interview, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee says he will now call for a new effort at national unity, noting that people from different political views have called him.\n\n“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he said.\n\nTrump also reflected on the moment a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear. He said he was saved from death because he turned from the crowd to look at a screen showing off a chart he was referring to.\n\n“That reality is just setting in,” he told the news outlet as he boarded his plane in Bedminster, New Jersey, for Milwaukee. “I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?”\n\nBiden says that during the Republican National Convention, he has “no doubt” Republicans will “criticize my record and offer their own vision for this country.” But he promised in campaigning to lay out “our vision.”\n\nHe used the address to urge all Americans not to accept an escalation in political violence as normal.\n\n“We debate and disagree, we compare and contrast ... but in America we resolve our differences at the ballot box,” Biden said in his address.\n\nHe added: “Politics must never be a literal battlefield. God forbid a killing field.”\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson says one of his staff members is no longer employed after he learned of a post she made on social media.\n\nScreenshots of her apparent Facebook post, which was related to the attempted assassination of Trump, circulated on social media after the shooting.\n\nThe screenshots showed a post in which the staffer appeared to say she does not condone violence but suggested the shooter should get “shooting lessons” and should not have missed.\n\nThe AP was not able to view the user’s private Facebook profile to identify whether the post was still up.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers is asking officials to revisit a prior decision that allows people to bring guns within blocks of the Republican National Convention after an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nEvers believes additional steps need to be taken to keep the convention’s attendees, law enforcement and the local community safe, the person said. The person could not discuss details of the request publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe request was made to the U.S. Secret Service, which would bring it to the Republican National Committee, the person said.\n\nThe Secret Service said at a news conference Sunday that they were confident in their existing security plan and hadn’t made any changes following the shooting.\n\nThe cloudburst of speculation and conjecture as Americans turned to the internet for news about the Trump rally shooting is the latest sign of how social media has emerged as a dominant source of information — and misinformation — for many, and a contributor to the distrust and turbulence now driving American politics.\n\nMentions of Trump on social media soared up to 17 times the average daily amount in the hours after the shooting, according to PeakMetrics, a cyber firm that tracks online narratives. Many of those mentions were expressions of sympathy for Trump or calls for unity. But many others made unfounded, fantastical claims.\n\n“We saw things like ‘The Chinese were behind it,’ or ‘Antifa was behind it,’ or ‘the Biden administration did it.’ We also saw a claim that the RNC was behind it,’” said Paul Bartel, senior intelligence analyst at PeakMetrics. “Everyone is just speculating. No one really knows what’s going on. They go online to try to figure it out.”\n\n▶ Take a look at some of the unsubstantiated claims that surfaced online following the shooting\n\n1 of 3 |\n\nHelmets rest on the locker of firefighter Corey Comperatore at the Buffalo Township Fire Company 27 in Buffalo Township, Pa., Sunday, July 14, 2024.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nCorey Comperatore’s quick decision to use his body as a shield against the bullets flying toward his wife and daughter rang true to the close friends and neighbors, who loved and respected the proud 50-year-old Trump supporter.\n\n“He’s a literal hero,” said Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for the last eight years.\n\nAt least two other people were injured at the rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday.\n\n▶ Read more on the Trump rally shooting victims\n\nThe shooter at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking, according to an AP analysis of more than a dozen photos and videos from the scene, as well as satellite imagery of the site.\n\nHere’s some of the key moments in the timeline of the shooting:\n\n6:02 p.m. EDT\n\n— Trump takes the stage to the strains of “God Bless the U.S.A.” He waves at the cheering crowd and begins his regular rally speech, with spectators both in front of him and behind him on risers.\n\nAround 6:10 p.m.\n\n— After rally-goers notice a man climbing on the top of the roof of a nearby building, a local law enforcement officer climbs to the roof, according to two law enforcement officials.\n\n— A man identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks points his rifle at the officer, who retreats down the ladder, the officials said.\n\n— Crooks then quickly fires, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\n— As the first pop rings out, Trump says, “Oh.” He raises his hand to his right ear and looks at it before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern.\n\n— Secret Service agents rush to the stage and pile atop the former president to shield him.\n\n— Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former fire chief attending the rally, is shot and killed. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Sunday that Comperatore used his body as a shield to protect his wife and daughter.\n\n— Secret Service counter snipers fire back and shoot Crooks.\n\nAbout 1 minute after the shots\n\n— Video shows Trump getting to his feet and reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was smeared with blood. As Trump stands up, he pumps to the crowd with his right fist.\n\n6:50 p.m.\n\n— Secret Service says “the former president is safe.”\n\n▶ Read the full timeline of the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nA crew was power-washing the front of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company on Sunday with plans to install memorial drapery to honor the slain former chief, Corey Comperatore.\n\nAssistant Chief Ricky Heasley of Sarver, who knew Comperatore for more than a decade, remembers him as very outgoing and full of life.\n\n“He never had a bad word,” Heasley said.\n\nA GoFundMe launched to support Comperatore’s family had already surpassed more than $180,000 in donations as of Sunday.\n\n▶ Read more on what’s known about the Trump rally shooting victim\n\nNot long before shots rang out, rally goers noticed a man climbing to the top of a roof of a nearby building and warned local law enforcement, according to two law enforcement officials.\n\nOne officer climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder and Crooks quickly took a shot toward former President Donald Trump, and that’s when the U.S. Secret Service counter snipers shot him, said the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\nPresident Biden said he’s directed an independent review of the security at the rally Saturday where a gunman apparently tried to assassinate Donald Trump.\n\nBiden said he has also directed the U.S. Secret Service to review all security measures for the Republican National Convention which begins Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nBiden urged Americans not to make assumptions about the motive of the shooter, who was killed by U.S. Secret Service. He says they’re working swiftly to investigate the incident.\n\n“Unity is the most elusive goal of all,” he added, while urging the public to strive for it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden says he’ll address the nation from the Oval Office on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. following the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump at a political rally.\n\nBiden spoke briefly Sunday afternoon saying he and Jill Biden were praying for the family of the person killed at the rally and that he was sincerely grateful that Trump is “doing well and recovering.”\n\nBiden says: “There’s no place in America for this kind of violence, or any violence for that matter.”"
