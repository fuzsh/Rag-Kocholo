        "text": "This story is part of the WHYY News Climate Desk, bringing you news and solutions for our changing region.\n\nFrom the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.\n\nTropical Storm Debby, which remains in the Southeastern U.S., is expected to travel up the East Coast later this week, passing over the Mid-Atlantic Friday, bringing high winds and downpours.\n\nForecasters at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey, say the Philadelphia region could see severe thunderstorms, and even some tornadoes. “But the greatest impacts are going to be the potential for some heavy rainfall,” Mike Lee, meteorologist at NWS in Mount Holly, said Wednesday. “Some scattered to widespread instances of flash flooding that could lead to road closures, flooded roadways.”\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida early Monday, bringing catastrophic flooding and contributing to at least six deaths. Its center moved off the coast of the Carolinas Wednesday and made a second landfall Thursday. The storm is expected to dump potentially historic amounts of rain on parts of the Southeastern U.S. by the end of the week.\n\nOn Tuesday, the storm’s moisture supercharged an unrelated cold front that passed through the Philadelphia region, causing flash flooding in some areas.\n\nCentral Jersey saw the heaviest rain, with some locations — like Delran, Pennington and Hopewell Township — recording more than 7 inches over 24 hours. Areas of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, saw roughly 4 inches of rain — about a month’s worth.\n\nFloodwaters shut down a highway in Cinnaminson, New Jersey, blocked streets in Beverly, New Jersey,, and filled an underpass in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. A downpour caused a roof to collapse in Croydon. Dozens of people were rescued from flooding in Burlington County, New Jersey.\n\nLee said the direct impacts of Debby on Friday could be similar, but it’s hard to predict where and how intense they’ll be because there is still uncertainty about the precise path the storm will take up the East Coast.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, forecasters with the National Hurricane Center predict the storm’s center will likely move up through central and eastern Pennsylvania Friday. They expect “considerable flooding impacts” across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nThe risk of heavy rain will be the highest in central Pennsylvania on Friday, forecasters with the NWS in Mount Holly, say.\n\nRiverine flooding could continue after the rain clouds clear\n\nThe rain could clear by Saturday afternoon, meteorologists say. But any flooding of rivers and streams could last longer.\n\n“A lot of those specific details, we’ll have to wait to see exactly … where it’s going to move,” Lee said.\n\nForecasters in the Philly region expect rivers to rise by the end of this week, potentially overflowing their banks over the weekend or into early next week.\n\n“We know [Debby’s] got a lot of moisture to work with,” Gregory Jenkins, professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State University, told WHYY News Monday. “And … when that tropical moisture gets up north, it’s going to rain.”\n\nResidents of the Philadelphia region should stay up to date with NWS forecasts throughout the week, Jenkins said.\n\nThe multiple bands of heavy rain this week could be problematic, Jenkins said — because they might saturate the ground and leave little room for additional rain to soak in.\n\n“It’s gonna be a doozy,” he said."
