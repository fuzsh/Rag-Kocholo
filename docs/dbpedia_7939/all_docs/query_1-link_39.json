        "text": "Scoot over, Zoom fatigue. There’s a new sheriff in town: time zone fatigue. If you have one employee working in California, another in Wisconsin, and another in Maine, you’re probably already familiar with the condition. To get through the confusion, you need a cheat sheet to understand the different time zones in the USA. And, voila! It has arrived.\n\nRead on to learn why time zones matter in business, what the different time zones spanning the states are, and how to handle time zone differences.\n\nWhy do time zones matter in business?\n\nIn this day and age, everyone is interconnected. And with many businesses nationwide (and globally) working and operating remotely, juggling multiple time zones is common.\n\nYou may work with the following parties across different time zones:\n\nEmployees\n\nVendors\n\nBusiness partners\n\nCustomers\n\nWhether you’re calling to place an order from a vendor or scheduling a meeting with a remote team, time zones matter.\n\nWhat are the time zones in the USA?\n\nThere are several different time zones in the United States. Take a look at the six zones all 50 states and D.C. could fall under, along with an example of the time difference for each:\n\nEastern Standard Time (EST) | 2 p.m.\n\nCentral Standard Time (CST) | 1 p.m.\n\nMountain Standard Time (MST) | 12 p.m.\n\nPacific Standard Time (PST) | 11 a.m.\n\nAlaska Standard Time (AKST) | 10 a.m.\n\nHawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HST) | 8 a.m.\n\nMost states also follow daylight saving time (DST), which can throw a wrench in your ability to keep up with different time zones.\n\nWhat to know about daylight saving time\n\nDaylight saving time is the practice of changing the clocks by one hour in the spring and the fall—springing forward and falling back. In the spring, the clocks go forward (1 p.m. becomes 2 p.m.). In the fall, the clocks go backward (2 p.m. becomes 1 p.m.).\n\nDaylight saving time begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. In total, DST lasts 34 weeks. The purpose is to increase daylight hours so that darkness falls later during the summer months.\n\nBut, not all states follow daylight saving time. Officially, Arizona (excluding Navajo Nation) and Hawaii do not observe DST. Several other states that do follow DST have introduced legislation to end the practice of changing clocks.\n\nNot to mention, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill to make daylight savings time permanent in March 2022. If it passes in the House and is signed into law by the president, daylight saving time would be permanent. The bill would also allow Arizona and Hawaii to remain on standard time.\n\nLet’s take a look at an example of how DST currently impacts time zone differences. During daylight savings time in Ohio, Ohio is three hours ahead of Arizona. But when Ohio falls back an hour in November, there’s only a two-hour time difference between Ohio and Arizona since Arizona doesn’t follow DST. So although Arizona is on MST and Ohio is on EST (spoiler!), Arizona is three hours behind during DST.\n\nWhich states are in which time zones? 2 Charts to use\n\nWant to see which states are in which time zones? We’ve included two charts, depending on what you need. Use Chart 1 to see states categorized by time zone. Use Chart 2 to see states categorized alphabetically.\n\nHeads up! If you do work internationally, make sure to understand global time zones, too.\n\nChart 1: Time zone\n\nCheck out our time zone chart. Remember that some states have two time zones, depending on the county or town (indicated with an *).\n\nChart 2: Alphabetical\n\nWant to find your state and see its time zone? Use our state chart below, organized alphabetically. Again, some states use multiple time zones, depending on the area.\n\nTips for handling different time zones\n\nThere may be times when working with a vendor or customer in a different time zone impacts your day … like if you go to place an order and they’re already closed. Or if you tell a customer you’ll call them at 5 p.m. and you’re two hours behind them.\n\nBut, the most common situation you may face with time zone confusion is among your team. According to Gallup, 45% of full-time U.S. employees work from home. And if you let employees work anywhere in the country, their time zones may get a little tricky to juggle.\n\nTake a look at the following tips to help you handle different time zones with ease.\n\n1. Use time and attendance software\n\nNeed an easier way to track employee hours across different time zones? Use time and attendance software with a time zone setting.\n\nEmployees can enter their in and out times according to their time zone, eliminating confusion and miscommunication for both employers and employees.\n\n2. Be clear about the time zone you’re talking about\n\n“Let’s meet at 1 p.m.” Is that 1 p.m. my time … or yours? If you have employees (or vendors, etc.) working across different time zones, simply saying a time may cause confusion.\n\nTo clear the air, communicate which time zone you’re referencing. If possible, you can detail the different times for each party. For example, you may say something like “1 p.m. EST, which would be 12 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. PST.”\n\n3. Use consistency when scheduling meetings\n\nConsider setting up meetings for the same time to provide consistency among employees, customers, vendors, etc.\n\nIf employees work varying schedules, schedule meetings during times when all employees are active.\n\n4. Take advantage of tools\n\nConsider taking advantage of the following to help you stay organized and on top of deadlines when working with people in different time zones:\n\nProject management tools (e.g., Jira)\n\nCollaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace)\n\nCommunication tools (e.g., Slack)\n\nSome tools, like Slack, alert you of someone else’s time zone if you send a message early in the morning or late in the evening for them.\n\nKeeping ahead of time zone differences\n\nEffectively manage the difference between time zones to avoid miscommunication blunders with employees, vendors, and customers.\n\nWhether you’re scheduling meetings, placing orders, or planning projects, keep the following time zone tips in mind:\n\nUnderstand the different time zones in the U.S. (or beyond if you work internationally)\n\nMake sure all parties know what time zone you’re talking about\n\nTake advantage of tools to help you work with people in different time zones\n\nThis article has been updated from its original publication date of September 23, 2022."
