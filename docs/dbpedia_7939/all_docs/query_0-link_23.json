        "text": "The latest on the bill that would halt our twice-a-year clock changing, and dates to keep in mind this fall and spring:\n\nPENNSYLVANIA — Daylight savings time is just around the corner in Pennsylvania, as legislation that would have ended the twice-a-year clock changing has not yet been passed through U.S. Congress.\n\nThe state will “fall back” at least one more time, as daylight saving time officially ends at 2 a.m. on Nov. 6. Pennsylvania will return to daylight saving time on Sunday, March 12, 2023.\n\nThe Pennsylvania House State Government Committee approved a bill last fall that would permanently keep the state on Eastern Standard Time. However, it's been \"laid on the table\" since late January, meaning that it's still awaiting further action on the House floor.\n\nThat bill is the brainchild of Republican Rep. Russ Diamond of Lebanon County, who contends that changing the clocks - an idea launched during World War I as an attempt to save energy - has outlived its usefulness.\n\n\"Studies have shown that automobile accidents, workplace injuries, heart attacks, strokes, cluster headaches, depression, and suicides all increase in the weeks following clock changes,\" Diamond shared. \"These government-mandated interruptions of natural biological rhythms and sleep cycles can wreak havoc on job performance, academic results, and overall physical/mental health. Clock changes require farmers to make needless adjustments, as crops and animals live by the sun, not a timepiece.\"\n\nMost have considered some legislation on daylight saving time, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2015, at least 350 bills and resolutions have been introduced in virtually every state, whether establishing daylight saving or standard as the year-round time.\n\nAny changes would have to be approved by Congress, which doesn’t know yet what, if anything, it will do about daylight saving time. You may recall the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act earlier this year, delighting a majority of Americans annoyed by the ritual of springing forward and falling back.\n\nAs the proposed legislation stands now, year-round daylight saving time would take effect in November 2023, assuming it passes the House and President Joe Biden signs it. Hawaii and, for the most part, Arizona are exempted from the current law on daylight saving time and would be in the proposed legislation as well.\n\nNo action has been taken on the House version of the legislation to make daylight saving time permanent, and it’s unlikely to until lawmakers can come to agreement on a fundamental question:\n\nWhich should it be, year-round daylight saving time, as the Senate version stipulates, or year-round standard time, which some lawmakers in rural states prefer?\n\n“I can’t say it’s a priority,” U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told The Hill earlier this year.\n\nThose priorities include dealing with inflation, which hasn’t been this high since 1981; securing enough votes in the House to pass a federal assault weapons ban and other issues related to gun violence in America; and codifying rights, such as same-sex marriage and abortion when a mother’s life is threatened, put in jeopardy when the conservative U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n“We continue to try to come up with a consensus but so far, it’s eluded us,” Pallone told The Hill. “The problem is that a lot of people say to me, ‘Oh, we should just have, you know, we shouldn’t switch back and forth, we should just have standard or daylight saving,’ but then they disagree over which one to enact. And so that’s the problem. We need a consensus that if we’re gonna have one time, what is it? And I haven’t been able to get a consensus on that.”\n\nPallone’s remarks aren’t surprising.\n\nAfter the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine asked the House panel to take a step back and take a thoughtful look at the pros and cons of both options, saying the group didn’t get a chance to debate the merits of the proposal before it was rushed through the Senate late last winter.\n\n“If we can get this passed, we don’t have to do this stupidity anymore,” Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who sponsored the legislation, said at the time. “Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come.”\n\nThe sleep medicine group pointed to research showing the sudden switch from standard to daylight saving time on the second Sunday in March is associated with significant public health and safety risks. Among them: An increase in heart attacks, mood disorders and motor vehicle crashes.\n\n“Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety,” the group said, adding its statement had been endorsed by more than 20 medical, scientific and civic organizations.\n\nDaylight saving time from spring to early fall became the national standard in the 1960s when Congress passed the Uniform Time Act.\n\nThe United States has tried year-round daylight saving time twice before, the first time from 1942-1945 in an effort to conserve fuel during World War II. A daylight saving time trial in 1974 lasted only about 10 months before Congress, facing widespread public criticism, voted to undo the change.\n\nSome of the same arguments are being made today.\n\nAlthough year-round daylight saving time would talk on an extra hour of daylight in the late afternoon and early evening during the fall and winter months, it would mean many of America’s children would be getting to school in the dark.\n\nConsider the shortest day of the year, the winter solstice. On Dec. 21, 2023, sunrise in New York City is 7:17 a.m. and sunset is 4:30 p.m. With the proposed law in effect, sunrise wouldn’t be until 8:17 a.m. and sunset would be pushed to 5:30 p.m.\n\nIn Seattle, year-round daylight saving time would push sunrise on the date of the 2023 winter solstice to 8:55 a.m. and sunset to 5:20 p.m.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll in April found that 46 percent of Americans want year-round daylight saving time, 33 percent favor year-round standard time and 21 percent want to leave things as they are. That poll found older Americans were slightly more inclined than younger people to prefer year-round daylight saving time. Support for year-round daylight time was highest in the Northeast, Midwest and South.\n\nA Monmouth University Poll a month earlier found two-thirds of Americans want to do away with the clock re-setting practice. About 44 percent prefer making daylight saving time permanent, while 13 percent favor year-round standard time.\n\nThose polls compare to an Associated Press/National Opinion Research Center poll in 2019 that found 40 percent of Americans want year-round standard time, compared with 31 percent who prefer daylight saving time all year and 28 percent who want to keep changing their clocks.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
