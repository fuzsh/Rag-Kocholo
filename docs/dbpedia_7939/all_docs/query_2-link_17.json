        "meta_description": "Pennsylvania - Colonial History, Amish Culture, Industry: Pennsylvania has retained strong elements of folk culture among its diverse ethnic groups. The Plain People—the Amish, the Mennonites, and other small sects—have kept their traditional ways of life based in the teachings of the Bible. Lancaster county is the original home of the Amish, but owing to the growth of their population, they have expanded to other areas in Pennsylvania and throughout the country. The folk art and cooking of the Pennsylvania Dutch are famous, and their brightly painted designs known as hex signs adorn their large barns. Typical Pennsylvanian foods include scrapple (seasoned cornmeal mush with pork), baked",

As Pennsylvania grew and prospered, Pittsburgh and other, smaller cities also became centres of the arts, but Philadelphia remains in the national cultural spotlight.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 17, 2024, 7:49 PM ET (AP)\n\nTrump zigzags between economic remarks and personal insults at rally in critical Pennsylvania\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 9:23 PM ET (AP)\n\nA stowaway groundhog is elevated to local icon\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 3:05 PM ET (AP)\n\nPennsylvania troopers stop drivers at similar rates no matter their race or ethnicity, study finds\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 10:55 AM ET (AP)\n\nHarris campaign's new $90 million in battleground ads in August aims to sharpen contrast with Trump\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 10:51 PM ET (AP)\n\nThe Latest: Trump interview with Elon Musk on X plagued by glitches\n\nTwo of the country’s major symphony orchestras are located in Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia Orchestra became world famous in the 20th century under conductors such as Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy, and Riccardo Muti, as did the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under Victor Herbert, Fritz Reiner, and William Steinberg. Philadelphia’s Academy of Music provides a home and concert hall for the Philadelphia Symphony, and the Curtis Institute of Music, founded in 1924, is one of the world’s leading conservatories. Harrisburg has a major regional professional orchestra, and there are many volunteer community orchestras throughout the state. Especially notable is the religious music of the Moravians; at their home in Bethlehem, the Bach Choir attracts music lovers from many other states to its Bach Festival each May.\n\nPhiladelphia is the home of one of the world’s finest art collections, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1877), as well as the Rodin Museum (1929). The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1805), also in Philadelphia, not only offers a base for teaching and study but also provides a notable collection of American art from the colonial through contemporary eras. The Carnegie Museum of Art (1895), in Pittsburgh, is noted for its holdings of American art and French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. The Palmer Museum of Art (1993), on the campus of Pennsylvania State University, has many fine contemporary paintings.\n\nAmong famous artists whose homes were in Pennsylvania are Charles Willson Peale, his sons Raphaelle and Rembrandt, and other members of his extended family, including his nieces Anna Claypoole and Sarah Miriam Peale; Benjamin West; Mary Cassatt; Thomas Eakins; and N.C. and Andrew Wyeth. The Calder family of Philadelphia is famous in sculpture; Alexander Milne Calder’s giant statue of William Penn stands atop City Hall, and his grandson, Alexander Calder, gained renown for his free-form mobile sculptures.\n\nPittsburgh and Philadelphia are well known for professional theatre. Two restored movie palaces form the centre of Pittsburgh’s cultural district: Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts (the home of the Pittsburgh Symphony) and nearby Benedum Center for the Performing Arts (formerly the Stanley Theater). Philadelphia has dozens of theatre companies, among them the Walnut Street Theatre, said to be the oldest continually operating theatre in the country. The Wilma Theater creates original productions and develops local talent. Summer theatres have proliferated across the state, especially in the many resort areas. Penn State, Temple, and Carnegie Mellon universities offer major programs in theatre. The Pennsylvania Ballet gives performances within the state and also tours around the country.\n\nAmong well-known writers with Pennsylvania origins are Pearl Buck, Rachel Carson, James Michener, Christopher Morley, John O’Hara, Mary Roberts Rinehart, John Updike, and Donald Barthelme.\n\nIn addition to its art museums, Pennsylvania has a variety of other types of attractions. The Franklin Institute (1824), in Philadelphia, has a science museum and a planetarium and offers educational programs on science and technology. Fine collections related to the history of the state are housed in the State Museum of Pennsylvania (formerly the William Penn Memorial Museum), in Harrisburg; the Landis Valley Museum, a living history museum near Lancaster; the Kemerer Museum of Decorative Arts, part of the Historic Bethlehem complex of open-air and historical museums; and the Mercer Museum of the Bucks County Historical Society, in Doylestown, focused on crafts and craftsmen’s tools. Fallingwater, near Uniontown, originally a private residence designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, is now open for tours. The Pennsylvania Historical Commission, established in 1913 and known since 1945 as the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, operates the State Museum, the Anthracite Heritage Museum and Iron Furnaces in Scranton, and the Drake Well Museum in Titusville; the Philadelphia Historical Commission oversees that city’s many historic shrines.\n\nSports and recreation\n\nMillions of tourists visit Pennsylvania each year not only for its cultural and historical attractions but also for its scenic beauty and opportunities for outdoor recreation. Pennsylvania has one of the country’s most extensive state park systems, with more than 100 parks and nearly 3,300 square miles (8,500 square km) of state forestland. Other popular activities are skiing at the many resorts in the Pocono Mountains, visits to the Amish country in Lancaster county, and tourism to colonial and other historic sites, such as Revolutionary and Civil War battlefields. Each February 2 the small west-central Pennsylvania community of Punxsutawney becomes the focus of international attention during the annual Groundhog Day observance held there.\n\nPennsylvania has a full complement of professional sports teams in each of the state’s two major cities: in baseball, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates; in football, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers (who have won multiple Super Bowl titles); and in ice hockey, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins. In addition, the Philadelphia 76ers men’s professional basketball team achieved great success in the mid-1960s, with the arrival of Wilt Chamberlain, and in the 1970s, during the Julius (“Dr. J”) Erving years. Williamsport is the site of the annual Little League (baseball) World Series."
