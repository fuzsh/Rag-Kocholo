        "text": "Twice a year, people throughout the country adjust their clocks, first “springing” ahead to cherish an extra hour of daylight during the summer months before “falling back” to Eastern Standard Time for winter.\n\nEvery year on the second Sunday of March, clocks are set ahead one hour at 2 a.m. — becoming 3 a.m. — marking the start of daylight saving.\n\nWith the passage of the summer solstice, some may notice nightfall is creeping earlier and earlier into daylight — a sure sign that summer’s end is getting closer.\n\nRead more: Midsummer COVID surge reaches ‘very high’ viral activity in Mass., CDC reports\n\nThis year, daylight saving kicked off March 10 and will end Sunday, Nov. 3.\n\nDaylight saving ends at 2 a.m., which changes to 1 a.m., on the first Sunday of November, every year.\n\nDaylight saving lasts for 238 days — about 65% of the year, according to National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n“In the United States, this has the effect of creating more sunlit hours in the evening during months when the weather is the warmest,” NIST reported.\n\nThe tradition was formally introduced in the United States in 1918 and while most of the country observes daylight saving time, these states and territories do not: Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the state of Arizona, with the exception of the Navajo Indian Reservation, which does observe DST.\n\nHow did daylight saving time start?\n\nGermany and Austria were the first countries to use daylight saving time in 1916 in an effort to conserve energy, according to National Geographic.\n\nHowever, portions of regions of Canada have been credited for starting the tradition even earlier.\n\nSome reports say residents of Ontario created the first daylight saving time zone by turning their clocks an hour forward between July and September in 1908, according to timeanddate.com\n\nA clock change called “Fast Time” was introduced in 1918 but was appealed less than a year later, though cities such as Boston, New York and Pittsburgh continued to use it.\n\nRead more: Look for a double star cluster in the sky during the next new moon\n\nDaylight saving was reintroduced by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942, under the term “War Time,” which held through 1945.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1966, no uniform rules for changing clocks existed until the Uniform Time Act of 1966 was passed, which provided a framework for a nationwide daylight saving time schedule.\n\nHow popular is changing the clocks twice a year?\n\nChanging the clocks is fairly unpopular.\n\nA CBS News poll of 1,612 adults indicated that most Americans don’t like changing the clocks.\n\nOf those sampled, 46% said they preferred daylight saving time all year round while 33% wanted standard time all year. Only 21% preferred the current system of switching back and forth.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, there are many states that are trying to stop from having the clocks switch.\n\nIn 2023, there were three bills to establish permanent standard time in Massachusetts, but none were enacted.\n\nRead more: ‘An ancestral home’: The magic that brings Black Americans to Oak Bluffs\n\nAll told last year, there were 75 pieces of legislation filed in 29 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. None of those bills became law that year, however.\n\nThere are 19 states that are ready to switch to permanent daylight saving time — Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — but congressional approval is required first.\n\nIs standard time better than daylight saving?\n\nThere is some disagreement about which is better — standard time or daylight saving time.\n\nFor sleep medicine doctor Karin Johnson at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, the research points to standard time.\n\nShe said her research completed with colleagues on sleep cycles shows that permanent standard time can improve brain functionality, mood, focus, and help reduce car crashes and the risk of developing long-term health conditions.\n\nRead more: U.S., Russia swapping prisoners, including Wall Street Journal reporter, AP source says\n\n“Timezones were designed to have the sun as close to being overhead at noon as possible,” Johnson said in 2022. “Daylight savings time shifts the clock an hour so we get later sunrises and sunsets. But unfortunately, our bodies don’t go by the clock time, they go by the sun time.”\n\nA Baystate Medical Center spokesperson at the time clarified in a statement that the medical center does not promote Johnson’s views.\n\n“Dr. Johnson’s comments were not a reflection of Baystate Health but her own personal position on the subject as a physician and involvement with the organization promoting it,” the statement read."
