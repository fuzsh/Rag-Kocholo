        "text": "Different time zones in the history of the United States\n\nThe history of standard time in the United States began November 18, 1883, when United States and Canadian railroads instituted standard time in time zones. Before then, time of day was a local matter, and most cities and towns used some form of local solar time, maintained by some well-known clock (for example, on a church steeple or in a jeweler's window). The standard time system was not immediately embraced by all. Standard time in time zones was established in U.S. law in the Standard Time Act on March 19, 1918, at which time daylight saving time was also instituted.\n\nUse of standard time gradually increased because of its obvious practical advantages for communication and travel. Standard time in time zones was established in U.S. law in the Standard Time Act on March 19, 1918.[1][2] The act established daylight saving time, which was and is a contentious idea. Daylight saving time was repealed in 1919, but standard time in time zones remained in law, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight time became a local matter; ultimately, it was reinstated nationally early in World War II and was continuously observed until the end of the war. After the war its use varied among states and localities. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 provided standardization in the dates of beginning and end of daylight time in the U.S. but allowed for local exemptions from its observance.\n\nTime zone boundaries have changed greatly since their original introduction, and changes still occasionally occur. DOT issues press releases when these changes are made. Generally, time zone boundaries have tended to shift westward. Places on the eastern edge of a time zone can effectively move sunset an hour later (by the clock) by shifting to the time zone immediately to their east. If they do so, the boundary of that zone is locally shifted to the west; the accumulation of such changes results in the long distance term westward trend. The process is not inexorable, however, since the late sunrises experienced by such places during the winter may be regarded as too undesirable. Furthermore, under the law, the principal standard for deciding on a time zone change is the \"convenience of commerce\". Proposed time zone changes have been both approved and rejected based on this criterion, although most such proposals have been accepted.\n\nRailway time\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the first reported incidents which brought about a change in how time was organized on railways in the United States occurred in New England in August 1853. Two trains heading towards each other on the same track collided in the Valley Falls train collision because the train conductors had different times set on their watches, resulting in the death of 14 passengers. Railway schedules were coordinated in New England shortly after this incident[3] Numerous other collisions led to the setting up of the General Time Convention, a committee of railway companies to agree on scheduling.[4]\n\nIn 1870 Charles F. Dowd, who was unconnected with the railway movement or civil authorities, proposed A System of National Times for Railroads, which involved a single time for railways but the keeping of local times for towns. Although this did not find favor with railway managers, in 1881 they agreed for the idea to be investigated by William Frederick Allen, who was the secretary of the General Time Convention and managing editor of the Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways. He proposed replacing the 50 different railway times with five time zones. He eventually persuaded the railway managers and the politicians running the cities that had several railway stations that it was in their interests to speedily adopt his simpler proposals, which aligned the zones with cities' railroad stations. In doing so, they would pre-empt the imposition of more costly and cumbersome arrangements by different state legislators and the naval authorities, both of whom favored retention of local times.[4]\n\nOn 11 October 1883, a convention of railroad executives met in Chicago at the General Time Convention (latter renamed the American Railway Association) and agreed to the implementation of five time zones in North America, using Greenwich Mean Time as a basis.[5][6] Right to the end there was opposition expressed by many smaller towns and cities to the imposition of railway time. For example, in Indianapolis the report in the daily Sentinel for November 17, 1883, protested that people would have to \"eat sleep work ... and marry by railroad time\".[7] However, with the support of nearly all railway companies, most cities and influential observatories such as Yale and Harvard, this collaborative approach led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on November 18, 1883. This consensus held and was incorporated into federal law in 1918.[4][8][9]\n\nStandard time and war time\n\n[edit]\n\n\"War Time\" redirects here. This usage refers to the changes of the US War Time Act, not a general period of war.\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) was established by the Standard Time Act of 1918. The act was intended to save electricity for seven months of the year, during World War I.[10] DST was repealed in 1919 over a presidential veto,[11] but standard time in time zones remained in law, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight time became a local matter.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress enacted the War Time Act (56 Stat. 9) on January 20, 1942. Year-round DST was reinstated in the United States on February 9, 1942, again as a wartime measure to conserve energy resources.[12] This remained in effect until after the end of the war. After V-J Day, the word 'war' and the middle letter 'W' were changed to 'prevailing' and 'P', but the advance in the clock was not reverted. The Amendment to the War Time Act (59 Stat. 537) ended DST as of September 30, 1945. During this period, the official designation War Time was used for year-round DST. For example, Eastern War Time (EWT) would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time during this period.\n\nLocal-option daylight saving time\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1945 to 1966 U.S. federal law did not address DST. States and cities were free to observe DST or not, and most places that did observe DST did so from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in September. In the mid-1950s many areas in the northeastern United States began extending DST to the last Sunday in October. The lack of standardization led to a patchwork where some areas observed DST while adjacent areas did not, and it was not unheard of to have to reset a clock several times during a short trip (e.g., bus drivers operating on West Virginia Route 2 between Moundsville, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio, had to reset their watches seven times over 35 miles).[13]\n\nIn summer 1960 April–October Daylight Time was nearly universal in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and states east and north of there. In Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia and states north and east of there, some areas used DST and some did not. Except for California and Nevada, which had April–September Daylight Time, 99% of the rest of the country used Standard Time year-round. (The Official Guide says \"State law prohibits the observance of \"Daylight Saving\" time in Kentucky but Anchorage, Louisville and Shelbyville will advance their clocks one hour from Central Standard time for the period April 24 to October 29, inclusive.\")\n\nUniform Time Act\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the mid-1960s the airline and other transportation industries lobbied for uniformity of DST dates in the United States. The federal Uniform Time Act became law on April 13, 1966, and it mandated that DST begin nationwide on the last Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October, effective in 1967. The act explicitly preempted all previously enacted state laws related to the beginning and ending of DST effective in 1966. Any state that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law, provided that it exempted the entire state, and Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, and Michigan chose to do so. However, Alaska, Indiana, and Michigan subsequently chose to observe DST.\n\nThe act also continued the authority of the ICC over time zone boundaries. In subsequent years, the United States Congress transferred the authority over time zones to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).\n\nThe law was amended in 1972 to permit states that straddle a time zone boundary to exempt the entire area of the state lying in one time zone. Indiana chose to exempt the portion of the state lying in the Eastern Time Zone; however, that exemption was eliminated in 2006, and the entire state of Indiana now observes DST, leaving Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii as the only two states not to observe DST.\n\nIn response to the 1973 energy crisis, DST began earlier in both 1974 and 1975, commencing on the first Sunday in January (January 6) in the former year and the last Sunday in February (February 23) in the latter. The extension was not continued due to public opposition to late sunrise times during the winter months. In 1976, the United States reverted to the schedule set in the Uniform Time Act.[14]\n\nDaylight saving time extensions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law that contained a daylight saving rider authored by Senator Slade Gorton.[10] The starting date of DST was amended from the last Sunday of April to the first Sunday in April effective in 1987, extending DST three weeks; DST continued to end on the last Sunday in October. While the states retain the capability to exempt themselves from DST, they are forbidden by the 1966 federal law (15 USC 260a(b))[15] from increasing a state's time spent on DST, unless the United States Congress does this for the entire nation.\n\nStarting March 11, 2007, DST was extended another four to five weeks, by moving both its start date to the second Sunday of March and its end date to the first Sunday of November. This time the change was introduced by Representatives Fred Upton and Ed Markey and added to the Energy Policy Act of 2005; the House of Representatives had originally approved a motion that would have extended DST even farther from the first Sunday in March to the last Sunday in November, but Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici agreed to scale back the proposal in conference committee due to complaints from farmers and the airline industry. Proponents claimed that the extension would save \"the equivalent of\" 10,000 barrels (1,600 m3) of oil per day, but this figure was based on outdated U.S. Department of Energy information from the 1970s; later studies by the U.S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission have predicted much smaller energy benefits.[16] There is very little recent research on what the actual positive effects, if any, might be.\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nSince DST moves sunrise one hour later by the clock, late sunrise times become a problem when DST is observed either too far before the vernal equinox or too far after the autumnal equinox. Because of this, the extension was greeted with criticism by those concerned for the safety of children who would have been forced to travel to school before sunrise, especially in the month of March. In addition, the airline industry was especially concerned if DST were to be extended through to the last Sunday in November, as this is very often the Sunday after Thanksgiving (except for 2013, 2019, 2024, and 2030), as this is always the Sunday after the fourth Friday in November, and Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday in November. This is one of the busiest travel days at American airports, and could have resulted in much havoc among travelers who forgot that the clocks were changing that day.\n\nIf the original proposal to extend DST through the last Sunday in November had been adopted, the entire United States, with the exception of the states that exempted themselves, would have experienced the latest sunrises of the year during the month of November, which would have approached the extremely late sunrise times when DST went into effect on January 6, 1974, due to the 1973 energy crisis creeping after 9 am in places like New Salem, North Dakota at the northwestern edges of time zones.\n\nUnder the current rules, the latest sunrise occurs on the day before DST ends, everywhere in the United States that observes DST. This sunrise time is later than any during the winter months.\n\nKey to colors future date second Sunday March, first Sunday November first Sunday April, last Sunday October last Sunday April, last Sunday October\n\nYear DST begins (local) DST ends (local) Notes 2026 Sun March 8 02:00 Sun November 1 02:00 2025 Sun March 9 02:00 Sun November 2 02:00 2024 Sun March 10 02:00 Sun November 3 02:00 2023 Sun March 12 02:00 Sun November 5 02:00 2022 Sun March 13 02:00 Sun November 6 02:00 2021 Sun March 14 02:00 Sun November 7 02:00 2020 Sun March 8 02:00 Sun November 1 02:00 2019 Sun March 10 02:00 Sun November 3 02:00 2018 Sun March 11 02:00 Sun November 4 02:00 2017 Sun March 12 02:00 Sun November 5 02:00 2016 Sun March 13 02:00 Sun November 6 02:00 2015 Sun March 8 02:00 Sun November 1 02:00 2014 Sun March 9 02:00 Sun November 2 02:00 2013 Sun March 10 02:00 Sun November 3 02:00 2012 Sun March 11 02:00 Sun November 4 02:00 2011 Sun March 13 02:00 Sun November 6 02:00 2010 Sun March 14 02:00 Sun November 7 02:00 2009 Sun March 8 02:00 Sun November 1 02:00 2008 Sun March 9 02:00 Sun November 2 02:00 2007 Sun March 11 02:00 Sun November 4 02:00 Energy Policy Act of 2005 2006 Sun April 2 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 All of Indiana now on DST 2005 Sun April 3 02:00 Sun October 30 02:00 2004 Sun April 4 02:00 Sun October 31 02:00 2003 Sun April 6 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 2002 Sun April 7 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 2001 Sun April 1 02:00 Sun October 28 02:00 2000 Sun April 2 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 1999 Sun April 4 02:00 Sun October 31 02:00 1998 Sun April 5 02:00 Sun October 25 02:00 1997 Sun April 6 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 1996 Sun April 7 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 1995 Sun April 2 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 1994 Sun April 3 02:00 Sun October 30 02:00 1993 Sun April 4 02:00 Sun October 31 02:00 1992 Sun April 5 02:00 Sun October 25 02:00 1991 Sun April 7 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 1990 Sun April 1 02:00 Sun October 28 02:00 1989 Sun April 2 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 1988 Sun April 3 02:00 Sun October 30 02:00 1987 Sun April 5 02:00 Sun October 25 02:00 Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 1986 Sun April 27 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 1985 Sun April 28 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 1984 Sun April 29 02:00 Sun October 28 02:00 1983 Sun April 24 02:00 Sun October 30 02:00 Alaska time zones changed Sun October 30 02:00 1982 Sun April 25 02:00 Sun October 31 02:00 1981 Sun April 26 02:00 Sun October 25 02:00 1980 Sun April 27 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 1979 Sun April 29 02:00 Sun October 28 02:00 1978 Sun April 30 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 1977 Sun April 24 02:00 Sun October 30 02:00 1976 Sun April 25 02:00 Sun October 31 02:00 1975 Sun February 23 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 Emergency Daylight Time Act\n\nMichigan exempted, began DST Sun April 27 02:00 1974 Sun January 6 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 Emergency Daylight Time Act\n\nSouthern Idaho and eastern Oregon (Mountain time zone)\n\nbegan DST Sun February 3 02:00 1973 Sun April 29 02:00 Sun October 28 02:00 All of Michigan now on DST 1972 Sun April 30 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 1971 Sun April 25 02:00 Sun October 31 02:00 Indiana (Eastern time zone) opts out 1970 Sun April 26 02:00 Sun October 25 02:00 1969 Sun April 27 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 All of Alaska and Indiana now on DST 1968 Sun April 28 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 Arizona and Michigan opt out 1967 Sun April 30 02:00 Sun October 29 02:00 Alaska, Hawaii, Indiana and territories opt out 1966 Sun April 24 02:00 Sun October 30 02:00 Uniform Time Act of 1966 required states that used DST in 1966\n\nto conform to last Sunday in April to last Sunday in October 1946–65 Local decision, various dates 1945 Sun September 30 02:00 War Time ends 1944 War Time all year\n\nArizona War Time not observed Sat January 1 02:00–Sat April 1 02:00\n\nArizona War Time ends Sat September 30 02:00[17] 1943 War Time all year 1942 Mon February 9 02:00 War Time begins year round\n\nWar Time Act 1920–41 Local decision, various dates 1919 Sun March 30 02:00 Sun October 26 02:00 An Act For the repeal of the daylight-saving law\n\nenacted August 20, 1919 1918 Sun March 31 02:00 Sun October 27 02:00 Standard Time Act of 1918\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDaylight saving time in the United States – gives a list of future daylight saving dates\n\nPermanent time observation in the United States\n\nTime in Indiana\n\nTime in the United States\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nPrerau, David.
