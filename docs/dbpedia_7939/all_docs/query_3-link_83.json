        "text": "National maps are available in three types: Half Zones, Full Zones, and 2023-2012 Difference. Half Zones include A/B subdivisions, for more specific temperature ranges at a location. Full Zones do not include these subdivisions, and are thus broader indications of temperatures. 2023-2012 Difference maps show the change in half zones between the 2023 and 2012 editions of the map. National maps are available in 150 or 300 dpi, in PNG format. For downloads of national maps select them from the following dropdown menus.\n\nThe Plant Hardiness Zone Map is available in a number of sizes and resolutions to meet the needs of graphic artists, printers, and others needing higher resolution or simpler formats.\n\nFile LinkFile TypeFile SizeNational MapEPS45 MBNational MapJPG37 MBNational MapPDF16 MBNational MapPNG33 MBNational MapSVG78 MBNational MapTIF66 MB\n\nSimplified map components are available as separate maps and legends, without titles, without A/B zone divisions, both with and without a terrain relief background.
