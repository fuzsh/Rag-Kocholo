        "text": "For the Eastern Time Zone of Australia, see Time in Australia.\n\n\"Eastern Daylight Time\" and \"Eastern Daylight Savings Time\" redirect here. For the Eastern Daylight Time Zone of Australia, see Daylight saving time in Australia.\n\nEastern Time Zone (ET) is the time zone for the eastern part of the Americas including the United States, Canada and parts of South America and the Caribbean. ET is five hours behind UTC in winter, which is called Eastern Standard Time (EST). It is four hours behind UTC during summer Daylight saving time, when it is called Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).\n\nThe largest city in the Eastern Time Zone is New York, the largest city in the United States. The New York metropolitan area is the largest in the zone.\n\nIn Canada, the following provinces and territories are part of the Eastern Time Zone:\n\nOntario (except areas west of Thunder Bay but including Atikokan)\n\nQuebec (except far eastern Côte-Nord and the Magdalen Is.)\n\nEast-central Nunavut (including part of Melville Pen. and most of Ellesmere and Baffin Is., including Iqaluit; Southampton Island does not observe Daylight saving time)\n\nIn the United States, the following states are part of the Eastern Time Zone:\n\nParts of several other states use Eastern Time as well:\n\nnearly all of Florida except for the west border with Alabama\n\nmost of Indiana (all except the Evansville area and the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois)\n\neastern half of Kentucky\n\nall of Michigan except the four counties that border Wisconsin (Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, Menominee).\n\nthe eastern third of Tennessee\n\nsome towns in eastern Alabama, including Phenix City, Smiths Station, Lanett, and Valley, observe Eastern Time, although they are officially in the Central Time Zone. The main reason for this is because they are close to Columbus, Georgia, which is in the Eastern Time Zone.[1]\n\nThe following countries that use Eastern Time Zone include:\n\nMexico - the eastern state of Quintana Roo\n\nPanama\n\nJamaica\n\nHaiti\n\nThe Dominican Republic\n\nCuba\n\nthe Bahamas\n\nNot all Caribbean countries observe Daylight saving time.\n\nIn South America this time zone is observed in:\n\nEcuador (except Galápagos)\n\nPeru\n\nParts of Brazil:\n\nthe state of Acre\n\nAmazonas - the southwestern region of the state."
