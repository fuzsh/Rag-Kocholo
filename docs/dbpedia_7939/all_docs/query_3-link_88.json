        "text": "Donald Trump will deliver his curtain-closing speech at the climax of the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.\n\nThe presidential nominee will be watched by former First Lady Melania Trump, making a rare public appearance.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been attending the four-day jamboree this week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the party makes its case to voters ahead of Novemberâs general election.\n\nTrump is expected to deliver \"a deep message of unity\" and share his vision of \"a new golden age for America\" in a speech lasting about an hour, according to campaign and party officials.\n\nHe is due to take the stage, for what will be his third consecutive Republican nomination, at around 21:00 local time (02:00 GMT) after a performance by Kid Rock.\n\nTrump told the Washington Examiner he completely rewrote the speech to make it less combative after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt last Saturday in Pennsylvania.\n\nScheduled to speak earlier on Thursday are World Wrestling Entertainment legend Hulk Hogan, Eric Trump, former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trump lawyer Alina Habba, and the head of Trump Golf International.\n\nDana White, head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson are also expected to take to the podium.\n\nThe former first lady is scheduled to walk out to the family box to watch her husband's speech in her first appearance at the 2024 convention since it began on Monday.\n\nTrump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner are also expected to join the former first lady. Barron Trump is not currently expected to appear.\n\nThe family members are expected to join Trump on stage after his address for the balloon drop that is all part of the razzmatazz of a US party political conference.\n\nOnce every four years each of the two main US parties hosts a convention to formally select their respective White House standard-bearer and prepare for the final stretch of campaigning.\n\nDuring the convention, the delegates from each state pledge their support to the candidate of their choice and approve a platform.\n\nIt was merely a formality for Trump as the party's presumptive nominee because he won 2,265 delegates in the primaries, enough for the nomination.\n\nThe Democrats hold their convention next month in Chicago."
