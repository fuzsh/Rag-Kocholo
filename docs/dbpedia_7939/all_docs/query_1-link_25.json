        "text": "Experience The Ultimate Sunblock: Erie's Total Solar Eclipse\n\nExperience a once-in-a-lifetime event in Erie, Pennsylvania! On April 8, 2024, Erie is in the path of totality for a total solar eclipse. For nearly four minutes, the afternoon sky will go dark as the moon passes between the sun and the Earth. Erie is the only major city in Pennsylvania in the path of totality.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the moon lines up perfectly to obscure the sun, creating \"totality\". At the time of totality, the sky will become dark, and the sun’s corona (or outer atmosphere) will be visible. During the 2024 total solar eclipse, nearly everyone in North America will see some part of the eclipse, but only those who live in or travel to the path of totality will experience all stages of this rare event. The difference between a total and partial eclipse is out of this world: if even one percent of the sun is visible during an eclipse, the sun is 10,000 times too bright to observe the most spectacular part - totality!\n\nA total solar eclipse is perhaps the most spectacular astronomical event that can be witnessed from Earth, and it can only be observed from some parts of the globe. Erie will be one of the few locations to see every stage of this awe-inspiring event. Plan your trip now to observe this phenomenon on the shores of Lake Erie!\n\nThe next Total Solar Eclipse in the contiguous United States won’t occur until 2044. Erie, Pennsylvania won’t be in the path of totality again until 2144!\n\nViewing Locations\n\nDuring Erie's Total Solar Eclipse, the sun will be high in the sky and visible from just about anywhere within Erie County. High traffic is expected in popular tourist locations along the water, including on Presque Isle State Park, which has only one entrance and exit point, and in Erie's Bayfront District. Please allow yourself ample time to get through traffic in these areas and heed the direction of officials.\n\nThis map has been created to guide visitors to areas within Erie County that will be suitable for eclipse viewing, with a capacity to host at least 250 people, including public parks and public events. Public parks noted on this map may not have amenities such as restrooms or seating available, and parking may be limited. Public events on this map may require a ticket purchase or pre-sale reservations. Please click on the icons for more details."
