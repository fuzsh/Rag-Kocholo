        "text": "Pennsylvania Zones - Understanding Plant Hardiness\n\nOne of the first things that any new gardener should do is find where he or she lives on the Pennsylvania USDA plant hardiness map. Click on the map above to enlarge it and find your plant hardiness zone.\n\nPlant hardiness, as defined by the USDA, refers to the hardiness of a particular species to tolerate average extreme winter low temperatures. Winter temperature data for the 2023 map was collected from thousands of weather stations all over the country over a period of thirty years.\n\nThis data, as well as other factors, such as elevation and proximity to a large body of water, were used to set plant hardiness zones for all areas of the country.\n\nPennsylvania zones include 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b and a very small section of 8a. If you have a difficult time finding your location on the above map, you can visit the USDA site where you can input your zip code to find out exactly which zone you are in. The Pennsylvania plant map serves as an extremely useful tool and is a good starting point when choosing plants.\n\nMany local nurseries will carry plants that are suitable for your particular growing region.\n\nAlways follow planting and care instructions carefully to ensure the best results."
