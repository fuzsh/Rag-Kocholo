        "text": "Cherry Springs State Park is nearly as remote and wild today as it was two centuries ago.\n\nNamed for the large stands of black cherry trees originally found in the area, the 82-acre state park is surrounded by the 262,000-acre Susquehannock State Forest. The Susquehannock Trail passes nearby and offers 85 miles of backpacking and hiking.\n\nNight sky enthusiasts flock to the park for its dark skies which are famous for great views of the Milky Way, planets, and hard-to-see astronomical objects and phenomena.\n\nSeasons and Hours\n\nThe park is open every day of the year.\n\nThe Cherry Springs Rustic Campground is open the second Friday of April through the last weekend in October.\n\nThe Night Sky Public Viewing Area is intended for short term (a few hours or less) star gazing and is not permitted for overnight stays.\n\nThe Overnight Astronomy Observation Field is open to registered users all night.\n\nContact the Lyman Run State Park office for facility seasons and hours.\n\nReservations\n\nCampsites in the campground are reservable. Make online reservations or call toll-free 888-PA-PARKS, from 7:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Monday to Saturday.\n\nDirections\n\nCherry Springs State Park is in on PA 44 in Potter County.\n\nGPS DD:Lat. 41.66384 Long. -77.82321\n\nDark Skies at Cherry Springs\n\nDue to its exceptionally dark skies, Cherry Springs State Park is one of the best places on the eastern seaboard for stargazing and the science of astronomy, which is the study and observation of:\n\nPlanets\n\nNebulae\n\nGalaxies\n\nStars\n\nOther heavenly bodies\n\nA dark night sky is a natural resource, just like plants, waterways, and wildlife. Recognizing this unique resource needed to be managed and protected, during 2000, DCNR declared Cherry Springs State Park its first Dark Sky Park.\n\nLearn, Experience, Connect\n\nCherry Springs State Park offers a wide variety of environmental education programs year round. Visitors gain appreciation and awareness toward the natural and historical resources through guided walks and hands-on activities.\n\nWeather permitting, a park educator or guest speaker presents public stargazing programs in the Night Sky Public Viewing Area and amphitheater.\n\nThese free programs are available throughout the summer. Program schedules are published in the local paper and at DCNR's calendar of events.\n\nWoodsmen Show\n\nDuring 1952, the first Woodsmen Show at Cherry Springs State Park attracted a crowd of 4,000 people.\n\nToday, the annual Woodsmen Show attracts thousands of spectators for the early August event. The show features lumberjack contests in:\n\nTree-felling\n\nLog rolling\n\nSpring board chopping\n\nStanding block chop\n\nChain-saw events\n\nRules and Regulations\n\nFor a safe and enjoyable park visit, all state park rules and regulations apply, including:\n\nCampfires -- Open fires are prohibited. Grills are located in the picnic area at the pavilion. Traditional campsites with fire rings are located in the park campground across the road.\n\nPets -- Pets are prohibited in the Night Sky Public Viewing Area, Overnight Astronomy Observation Field, and Rustic Campground.\n\nAlcohol -- Alcoholic beverages are prohibited in Pennsylvania state parks.\n\nGreen Lasers -- Green laser pointers are prohibited in the park at all times and for all reasons.\n\nFood, Wildlife, and Trash -- Food scraps invite scavengers, such as black bears, raccoons, opossums, and skunks. Store food in a vehicle to prevent damage to your equipment. Please wash dishes in a dish pan, then dispose of the water. No dishwashing is permitted in the restrooms or at the hydrants. Please place trash, accumulated during your stay, in the appropriate receptacles.\n\nCell Phones\n\nCherry Springs is very remote and most cell phones do not have network coverage. Currently, available providers are Verizon and T-mobile.\n\nDark Sky Fund/Association\n\nThe Cherry Springs Dark Sky Fund/Association is a “Friends” group under the Pennsylvania Parks and Forests Foundation.\n\nTheir mission is the protection of the dark night sky at Cherry Springs State Park and enhancing the astronomy experience through facility improvement and educational outreach programs.\n\nDark Sky Fund donations will be used to enhance the stargazing and astronomy experience at Cherry Springs State Park. Physical improvements to the park will help to eliminate any outside light pollution and remove overhead obstructions.\n\nDonations will also be used to educate local residents and visitors about the value of the night sky resource and why it needs to be preserved.\n\nFund donations have been used to:\n\nPlant light screening trees and shrubs\n\nConvert all park lighting to shielded, red-light fixtures\n\nBury overhead electrical lines\n\nInstall electrical pedestals on the astronomy field\n\nThe fund also has provided educational materials about astronomy and environmentally friendly lighting in the park and surrounding communities.\n\nDecisions about how the fund monies are spent are a collaborative effort of the park management and the Dark Sky Fund Advisory Council. The council is made up of astronomers from all over the country who regularly observe at Cherry Springs.\n\nHow to Donate\n\nDonation forms and envelopes for the Cherry Springs Dark Sky Fund are available at the astronomy information bulletin board, located adjacent to the restroom on the Overnight Astronomy Observation Field and donations may be inserted into the Dark Sky Fund’s donation tube -- a square, blue fee tube located next to the astronomy information bulletin board.\n\nPlease do not combine park fees and donation fees. Use the separate forms and envelopes. Thanks for your support!\n\nAccess for People with Disabilities\n\nThis activity or structure is ADA accessible. If you need an accommodation to participate in park activities due to a disability, please contact the park you plan to visit.\n\nIn an Emergency\n\nCall 911 and contact a park employee. Potter County is a part of the 911 Emergency Service System. A free, local-use phone is located at the camper check-in station.\n\nDirections to the nearest hospital are posted on bulletin boards.\n\nNearest Hospital"
