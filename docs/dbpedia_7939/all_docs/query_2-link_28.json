        "text": "To conduct clinical trials for the treatment of cancer in a consistent manner across many participating hospitals, cancer centers, and clinics requires the use of standard criteria for measuring how the disease impacts a patient’s daily living abilities, known to physicians and researchers as a patient’s performance status. The ECOG Performance Status Scale is one such measurement. It describes a patient’s level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.).\n\nResearchers worldwide consider the ECOG Performance Status Scale when planning cancer clinical trials to study new treatments. This numbering scale is one way to define the population of patients to study in the trial and guide physicians who enroll patients into those studies. It is also a way for physicians to track changes in a patient’s level of functioning as a result of treatment during the trial.\n\nThe ECOG Performance Status Scale circulates in the public domain and is therefore available for public use.\n\nIt is displayed below for future reference and to spur further standardization among researchers who design and evaluate cancer clinical research. It was developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), now the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and published in 1982.\n\nECOG Performance Status Scale\n\nGRADE ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS 0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction 1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work 2 Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours 3 Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours 4 Completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair 5 Dead\n\nComparing the ECOG Performance Status and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scales\n\nThe ECOG Performance Status Scale and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale are two widely used methods to assess the functional status of a patient. Both scales are in the public domain to classify a patient according to their functional impairment, compare the effectiveness of therapies, and assess the prognosis of a patient. The Karnofsky index, between 100 and 0, was introduced in a textbook in 1949.* Key elements of the ECOG scale first appeared in the medical literature in 1960.**\n\nThere are several ways to map the two scales. The table below displays one commonly used comparison."
