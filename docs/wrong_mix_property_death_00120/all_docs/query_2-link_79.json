        "text": "An iconic figure of post-war Hollywood, actor Robert Mitchum embodied the rugged and solitary anti-her s of American film noir in a string of classic dramas and mysteries, including \"Out of the Past\" (1947), \"His Kind of Woman\" (1952), and \"Angel Face.\" However, he proved versatile in almost every genre, from Westerns and thrillers - he played two of the scariest villains in screen history: Max Cady in the original \"Cape Fear\" (1962) and the homicidal false preacher in \"Night of the Hunter\" (1955 - to comedies and gentle romances like \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\" (1957), the first of two films he made with Deborah Kerr. He was so beloved as a man's man by both genders, that Mitchum was one of the few actors from the Hollywood of the '40s and '50s to play leads in the '70s, finding an even bigger audience on television in the '80s with the miniseries \"The Winds of War\" (1983) and \"War and Remembrance\" (1988)."
