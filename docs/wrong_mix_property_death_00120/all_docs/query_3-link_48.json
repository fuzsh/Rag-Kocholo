        "text": "“The only difference between me and my fellow actors is that I’ve spent more time in jail.”\n\nWhen you think of the great Classic Hollywood “tough guys,” the names Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson are often the first thing that come to mind. But off the screen, the legends couldn’t have been more different than their big screen counterparts. Robinson was an art collector. Cagney was a teetotaler. And Bogart was a Shakespeare-quoting chess enthusiast.\n\nBut when it comes to the life of Classic Hollywood tough guy Robert Mitchum, well, it reads very much like a Robert Mitchum movie. Rugged. Rebellious. And thoroughly irresistible.\n\nVery much the bad boy on and off the screen, Robert Mitchum’s rough and tumble personal life was every bit as real as his on-screen bad boys.\n\nHere at Warner Archive, we have seven Robert Mitchum films in our streaming library: Johnny Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, Betrayed, Holiday Affair, Home from the Hill, The Yakuza, Ryan’s Daughter and Promises to Keep. In honor of his centenary on August 6th, we wanted to take a minute and visit the 5 main reasons why Mitchum will always hold a special place in our hearts as Hollywood’s ultimate bad boy:\n\n#1. The Time He Served Time on a Chain Gang … at 15.\n\nBorn on August 6, 1917 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he was trouble from day one. His father was killed while Mitchum was just a toddler, and he was sent to live with his grandparents age 12. Always a prankster and troublemaker, he was expelled from middle school, then from high school, and became a “Wild Boy of the Road”: traveling through Depression-era America on railroad cars. At just 15 years old, he was picked up for vagrancy and placed on a Chain Gang in the Deep South. But even the chains of a chain gang couldn’t keep Mitchum in one place: He escaped, hitch-hiked his way back up North, and eventually rode the rails all the way out to California. (Some of Mitchum’s earliest screen appearances are streaming here at Warner Archive, including The Human Comedy and Johnny Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.)\n\n#2. The Time He Got Busted for Marijuana\n\nRobert Mitchum was a known marijuana user, so it really was only a matter of time before the cops caught up to him. Sure enough, a narcotics agent did just that on September 1st, 1948. Mitchum’s career was flying high, having hit his stride with a string of critically acclaimed film noirs like Crossfire and Out of the Past. (His first film noir, Betrayed, is streaming here at Warner Archive.) He was visiting friends at the home of Hollywood starlet Lila Leeds when the police raided the house, arresting Mitchum, Leeds, and two others. Mitchum knew that possession of an illegal substance was sure to ruin his acting career, and hinted as much when he responded to the cop’s questions of his name, age, and occupation with: “Former actor.” He was sentenced to 43 days on a prison farm, where photographers from LIFE magazine found a laconic, relaxed, smiling inmate: “I like jail,” he told them, comparing it to “Palm Springs, but without all the riff-raff.” Not only would Mitchum’s career survive the scandal, it also made him an even bigger box-office draw.\n\n#3. The time he was an amateur boxer.\n\nDuring the Depression, like so many young men his age, Mitchum volunteered for FDR’s Civilian Conservation Corps (the CCC). In 1936 he was assigned to work the forests outside of Chino, California — hard, laborious work. At night for a little r&r, the camp held amateur boxing fights and — a shock to no one, I’m sure — Mitchum was good. Very good. So good, in fact, that he ended up traveling around with a semi-pro boxing circuit in California for $25 a fight. Hollywood might very well have been robbed of Robert Mitchum, had he not broken his nose badly when fighting a middleweight. He quickly retired from the ring.\n\n#4. The Time He Got Fired for the Best Possible Reason Ever\n\nJohn Wayne and Lauren Bacall star in Blood Alley (streaming here at Warner Archive) but the role was initially Mitchum’s. The film was a project of Wayne’s production company, Batjac, and Wayne eagerly signed on Mitchum. There were the obligatory interviews with the press, some of which show Mitchum dressed in costume for he film. One day after filming on location in the Bay area, Mitchum was invited to be a guest of honor at a Coast Guard luncheon and most likely had one (or two) drinks too many at the festivities. Back with the crew, Mitchum allegedly got into a row with the production manager and a crew member. The story goes that Mitchum became so agitated, he threw the crew member into a river and was promptly fired. (NOTE: As irresistible as that image is, the truth is probably closer to Mitchum having a row with director William Wellman.)\n\n#5. The Time He Proved a Third Act was the Best Act\n\nIf a narcotics scandal couldn’t keep Mitchum down, the inevitable process of aging also had nothing on him. In spite of some career highs in the 1960s (namely, Cape Fear and The Longest Day), his career began to wane. But things took an unexpected turn in 1970 when he signed on to star in David Lean’s sprawling, epic drama Ryan’s Daughter. (Ryan’s Daughter is streaming here at Warner Archive in glorious HD.) Mitchum gave a critically-acclaimed performance (although, surprisingly, an Oscar nom managed to elude him), and went on to appear in a number of other critics darlings durign the 1970s, including Sydney Pollack’s The Yakuza (also streaming in HD here at Warner Archive). The 1980s saw Mitchum as a fixture in TV miniseries and made for TV movies, including two of the highest rated shows of the decade: North and South and War and Remembrance. His 1985 made for TV movie Promises to Keep is also streaming here at Warner Archive!\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: That time he was a Calypso Singer\n\nBecause ONLY Robert Mitchum is cool enough to get away with something like this:"
