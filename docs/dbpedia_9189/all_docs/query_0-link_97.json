        "text": "My first Po valley flat stage with some additional insight into Colli Euganei, which may or may not be a little bothersome to some sprinters.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/228879\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 13. Modena – Monselice, 157km, flat.\n\nClimbs:\n\nTeolo – 3,5km, 3,9%, cat. 4, 166m\n\nCobbles:\n\nArquà Petrarca – 400m, *\n\nThe most interesting to you are probably the last 35km inside Colli Euganei. They feature the only categorised climb of Teolo good 30km from the finish – something the breakaway will like to snatch and a tiny but potentially bothersome sting in Arquà Petrarca that is 400m at 9% on easy cobbles, roughly 6,5km from the finish line. It's preceeded by another little ledge of 500m at 7,7%.\n\nThe cobbled climb in Arquà Petrarca.\n\nOther quite interesting aspect (for me) is Lombardia and the Province of Mantova, which for some reason extends very far to the east, almost reaching Ferrara. I didn't wanted Lombardia on this stage. There will be time for it so i needed to do some additional twisting. Thankfully, the Padan roads are mostly wide, in good condition and there's a fine bridge over Po in Ficarolo that's just outside the grabby Lombardian hands. However, this forced me to have one rail crossing slightly before that. However, that's good 90km from the finish so it shouldn't matter.\n\nI've decided to start in Modena as otherwise i deemed the stage to be a bit too short. Because the last stage was in Bassa Modenese/Mirandolese i needed to bypass it. The easiest way is definitely from east, using Cento as an anchor. That however forced me to slightly clip the metropolitan areas of Bologna and Ferrara so i hope there's no ill will on their side. When crossing the Po and entering Veneto the situation is easier with only the provinces of Rovigo and Padova in the stage.\n\nPiazza Grande, Modena.\n\nI won't be focusing on the Estense gem that Modena is. However, this stage may as well be dedicated to these very rich Italian magnates, as during it there will be plenty of places founded by them. I guess i can mention that the entire central square – XII c. Piazza Granda with its Duomo and its bell tower Torre Ghirlandina are part of the UNESCO WHS. Also worth noting may be the VII c. lombardian Nonantola abbey, during the middle ages one of the most powerful in Europe and often a subject of disputes between the Holy-Roman Emperors and the Popes. Pope Hadrian III was buried in the abbey after his death in 885. One of abbey buildings is now used as the town hall of Nonantola.\n\nXVII c. Palazzo Ducale, Modena.\n\nAbbazia di Nonantola.\n\nThe first 65km in Emilia Romagna are inside a historically dispute area between Modena, Bologna and Ferrara. The stage also sort of runs alongside the borders between Modena, Bologna and Ferrara. The first 17km are eastwards towards San Giovanni in Persiceto that includes the passages through Nonantola and Sant'Agata Bolognese renown for being the HQ of Lamborghini. San Giovanni in Persiceto is the chief town of a little area of Persiceto located northwest of Bologna. This area was a Longobardian duchy created in 728 after the Lombards won it from the Byzantine Ravenna. The duchy was abolished as a result of Charlemagne's invasion in 774.\n\nSan Giovanni in Persiceto.\n\nFrom San Giovanni in Persiceto the stage will mostly head north towards Colli Euganei. To not end up in Finale Emilia, which was on the last stage i need to go through Cento. It's the largest town in this general triangle of Bologna, Ferrara and Modena. While now it's inside the metropolitan area of Ferrara, historically it's linked with Bologna. It even has a nickname of \"La piccola Bologna\" as its historical center for some people resembles that of Bologna. The town was founded in 1185 by the bishops of Bologna, who in 1378 also founded the Rocca di Cento. In 1502 the Pope Alexander VI took the town from Bologna and gave it to Lucrezia Borgia. Cento's Palazzo del Governatore was built on the occasion of a marriage between Lucrezia Borgia and Alfonso d'Este. The town was quite badly damaged by the 2012 earthquake. In 1995 the 12th stage of the Giro finished here and was won by Ján Svorada in a sprint.\n\nCento.\n\nRocca di Cento.\n\nThe race will cross the Po and enter the region of Veneto between the towns of Bondeno (on the Emilia-Romagna side) and Ficarolo (on the Veneto side). Bondeno is known as the place of first printing manufacture in Italy, done in 1463 by a printer from the Guthenberg factory in Mainz. The town is also home to one of these tiny Ferrara castles in a nearby village of Stellata overlooking the Po. The Rocca Possente was created in XI c. as a postguard on the river. The modern appearance was created by Nicolas II d'Este in 1362. It was restored once again in 1521 after a Venetian sacking. This castle is part of a UNESCO WHS entry on Ferrara. There was also a similar postguard in Ficarolo on the other side of the Po but now it's in ruins.\n\nRocca Possente, Bondeno.\n\nIn Ficarolo the stage enters the province of Rovigo (region of Polesine). After roughly 10km the stage enters the province of Padova over river Adige where it will stay to the finish. The crossing over Adige is done in Badia Polesine – the administrative and industrial hub of Alta Polesine. The town is also home to X c. Abbazia della Vangadizza founded by the duke of Mantova Almerico. The abbey was abolished in 1789 and designed for demolition in 1810 but some buildings like the chapel and bell tower were spared. One of the earliest memebers of the Este dynasty Alberto Azzo II is buried here. Also worth noting is XI c. Chiesa di Santa Maria dei Pra' located in Ponso, a village between Badia Polesine and Este.\n\nAbbazia della Vangadizza, Badia Polesine.\n\nSoon the stage enters the town of Este at the southern tip of Colli Euganei. However, the stage will go around Colli Euganei first and then enter them from north. A Po valley bronze age culture was named after the town. The town itself dates back to antiquity, when it was known as Ateste. It later gave name to the Este dynasty after in 1073 Alberto Azzo II founded a castle/residence in the town. In 1240 Este moved their residence to Ferrara as Este (town) fell to Venice. The town is home to 3 large necropoli from spanning from the Bronze Age to the Roman Empire, Duomo di Santa Tecla rebuilt after a 1688 earthquake, XI c. Chiesa di San Martino and Museo Nazionale Atestino (inside XVI c. Villa Mocenigo) housing many pre-Roman artifacts of the Este culture and of course the eponymous castle.\n\nCastello di Este.\n\nA glimpse of Colli Euganei, Monte Rusta (396m).\n\nColli Euganei is a sub-alpine hilly range that cuts deep into the Po plains and separates the Po plains from Friuli-Veneto plains. Highest peak is Monte Venda at 601m. Since antiquity the hills were famed for baths, since plenty of places with Terme in names like Abano Terme, Montegrotto Terme, Galzignano Terme or Battaglia Terme. They were also popular with many artists and nobiblities, hence a large amount of lavish villas and gardens.\n\nMonte Gremola (281m).\n\nColli Euganei were also quite densly populated in the Prehistoric so there are now a lot of places with very long history and a number of archaelogical sites. Such an example can be Lozzo Atestino just north of Este. Lozzo's possibly Roman or earlier fort was in XIV c. transformed into a full fledged castle Castello di Valbona.\n\nCastello di Valbona, Lozzo Atestino.\n\nThe stage enters Colli Euganei in Vò (very unusual name for an Italian town with a quite unusual letter backing it up). Like many other towns in the area it dates back to prehistoric. In antiquity it was known as Vadum. The modern town was created in XVI-XVII c. as a spa/summer location by various Venetian nobilities, who built some villas which were later repurposed like Ca' Erizzo which is now a town hall. The town is also a local wine center, cultivated on nearby hills of Boccon and Valnogaredo.\n\nThe center of Vò with Ca' Erizzo.\n\nRocca Pendice (304m), Teolo.\n\nI've previously mentioned Arquà Petrarca. However, there are also other small hills. The most prominent one is to a picturesque villlage of Teolo. It's a cat. 4 climb with 3,5km at 3,9%, which should be a tasty cookie for today's breakaway. The descent leads to Treponti. While small, it is quite technical with 4 harpins inside the first 1km. Just east of Treponti is XI c. Abbazia di Praglia. It's the main monastery of Colli Euganei. I could do a much harder variant of the stage by going deeper into Colli Euganei but i wanted to have a sprint stage foremost and also wanted to limit myself to larger and better quality roads. I feel the last 35km should still be more interesting than just a pan-flat approach.\n\nPiazza Tito Livio, Teolo.\n\nAbbazia di Praglia, Treponti.\n\nFrom Treponti the stage heads south via SP25 towards Monselice. It seems to be a popular training side for cyclists as i've seen plenty of them on the road. It's mostly flat, hugging local post-volcanic hills but there is a small bump between Torreglia and Galzignano Terme that's 800m at roughly 6%. Before Torreglia the peloton will pass in front of Villa dei Vescovi – one of those lavish Colli Euganei villas. This XVI c. former Padvian bishops residence is possibly the most recognizeable of all of Euganei villas. There are also other nearby villas like a Venetian XVI c. Villa Barbarigo in Valsanzibio south of Galzignano Terme. The stage will basically pass right in front of its main gate.\n\nVilla dei Vescovi, Luvigliano.\n\nVilla Barbarigo, Valsanzibio.\n\nThe last significant part of the stage starts just south of Valsanzibio and its the climb to Arquà Petrarca which i've spoken on before. At the bottom of this climb the stage will pass close by Laghetto della Costa – a tiny lake with a major archaelogical significance as it was a bronze age village. Now this site is part of UNESCO WHS under the Alpine prehistoric pile dwellings.\n\nArquà Petrarca.\n\nVilla Barbarigo's main gate seen from SP25.\n\nThe town of Arquà Petrarca was historically known as just Arquà. The postfix was added in 1870 to commemorate the famous poet Francesco Petrarca, who lived here during his final four years between 1370-1374. His tomb is now located near the town's center. While the town itself has antique origins (it was known as Arquata) the modern nucleus originates from X-XI c. Since XV c. it started to develop as a summer resort to various noble families of nearby Padova and Venezia, i guess partly thanks to Petrarca's fame. Since XVI-XVII c. the town went into hibernation and most of it's architecture with many XV-XVI c. civil and public housing stays intact to this day.\n\nArquà Petrarca is full of such cobbled climbs.\n\nArquà Petrarca is only 6km from the finish line that's in Monselice. It's a quite large town on the southeastern edge of Colli Euganei just 20km south of Padova. The town is overlooked by Rocca (110m) – the outermost hill of Colli Euganei. Thanks to this strategic location it was an important stronghold dating back to pre-Roman times. The mythological founding of this stronhold is assigned to a Trojan hero Opsicella. In antiquity it was known as Mons Silicis. During XII c. the town was strengthened by Ezzelino III da Romano of Treviso, at the time one of the richest guys in Veneto. He was also known as a tyrant and pillaged plenty of local regions including Colli Euganei. After some local disputes and sieges between various noble families it landed in the Republic of Venice to which it was a popular holiday destination. Plenty of downtown's palazzos date back to this period.\n\nCastello di Ezzelino, Monselice.\n\nSantuario delle Sette Chiese, Monselice.\n\nThe town is overlooked by a castle rebuilt by Ezzelino III as commisioned by the Holy-Roman Emperor Frederick II, XIII c. Torre di Ezzelino and XV c. Palazzo Marcello within the castle. Nowadays the castle is home to one of the largest medieval weapon and armor collection in Europe. Other sights include a large medieval park Parco Buzzaccarini dating back to XII c. XIII c. Chiesa di Santa Giustina, XIII c. Torre Mazzini, XV c. Palazzo del Monte di Pietà and many reinassance and baroque villas like Villa Duodo, Villa Emo or Villa Pisani. In Reinassance and Baroque the town was a popular pilgrimage spot thanks to late XVI c. Santuario delle Sette Chiese commisioned by a Venetian nobleman Pietro Duodo. I tried to find if there was any Giro stage that started or finished here but inside the last 40 years i couldn't find anything.\n\nTorre Mazzini, Monselice.\n\nVilla Duodo, Monselice.\n\nMaybe i should had to go harder with Colli Euganei but the next 3 stages will be deep in high mountains so today i wouldn't expect anything outlandish and there are already two-three stages designed for the breakaways and they will still have their chances while for sprinters it's one of their last chances to shine even if that tiny stint at Arquà Petrarca could potentially be problematic for their positioning. I wonder, how many peeps will drop off from the race after this stage.\n\nOclini has a lot of buzz thanks to its western dirt side. I personally don't care about it as there are more than plenty of different options and one of them will be the first stage of the Alpine triplet i'm planing. Because German is hard to write for me i'll be mostly using the Italian names of the places.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/208784\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 14. Bassano del Grappa - Passo Oclini, 180km, mountain, MTF.\n\nClimbs:\n\nPasso Manghen – 23km, 7,1% (max 15%), cat. 1, 2042m\n\nSan Valentino di Sopra / Obergummer – 12,3km, 8,3% (max 14%), cat. 1, 1341m\n\nSan Floriano / Obereggen – 6,9km, 10% (max 16%), cat. 2, 1561m\n\nPasso Oclini / Grimmjoch – 10,3km, 6,9% (max 13%), cat. 2, 1989m\n\nToday's stage includes some of the Trentno/Alto Adige muritos that are not associated with Bolzano, besides maybe San Valentino di Sopra/Obergummer. While there are already two cat. 1 climbs in the race this might be the first stage to feature actual HC climbs (Manghen and Obergummer).\n\nWhile technically it's a Dolomiti stage, it doesn't focus on the Marmolada/Sella Dolomites, but on the Fiemme Dolomites (Fleimstaler Alpen). Of course the name derives from Val di Fiemme (Fleimstal), which will be sort of a focal point of the stage (joint with Val d'Ega/Eggental). The Fiemme Dolomites cover the area between Bolzano and Valsugana vertically and Adige and the Marmolada group horizontally. For an Alpine range Dolomiti di Fiemme is relatively low lying with Cima d'Asta (east of Manghen) at 2847m being the highest peak.\n\nCima d'Asta (2847m).\n\nVal di Fiemme near Moena.\n\nFor the start, i need to somehow reach the Fiemme Dolomites. Orginally i had the start in Feltre, but because the town is the very middle of Giro's 3rd week i decided to move it back to Bassano del Grappa. It's well known in the cycling and military circles but touristically it's a rather underappreciated, very decently looking city. It's one of Italian Alpine hubs, at the mouth of the Brenta valley and the second largest city of the Province of Vicenza. Of course just north of the town is Monte Grappa and just west is Marostica (Giovanni Battaglin) and Asiago.\n\nBassano del Grapa.\n\nThe city was founded in II c. BC by a Roman noble Bassianus. The city's name derives from his name. In the middle ages it was one of the main cities of the Republic of Venice and an administrative center of the Brenta valley. It was located near the border with the Duchy of Feltre, which was in Primolano. In 1796 two major back to back battles between the Austrian and the French during the Napoleonic Wars took place near Bassano. They were part of an Austrian campaign to relief Mantova from then an ongoing French siege. The first (September) battle was the last Napoleon's victory during his perfect streak, as the 2nd one (November) was won by the Austrians. The orginal name of the town – Bassano Veneto was changed after WW1 to commemorate the battlefield of Monte Grappa.\n\nPiazza Garibaldi, Bassano del Grapa.\n\nBassano del Grapa still has a well preserved historic center with plenty of reinassance and baroque manor houses like XVI c. Villa Angarano, XVI c. Villa Ca' Erizzo Luca, XIII c. Palazzo Pretorio – former Podestà – an Italian equivalent of a medieval town hall or XIII c. Castello degli Ezzelini. Other sights include XV c. Duomo di Santa Maria in Colle, XIV c. Chiesa di San Francesco, XIII c. Chiesa di San Donato, XIII c. Chiesa di San Giorgio alle Acque or XIV c. Ponte degli Alpni.\n\nCastello degli Ezzelini, Bassano del Grapa.\n\nChiesa di San Francesco, Bassano del Grappa.\n\nJust north of Bassano del Grappa, deep above the Brenta valley is Calà del Sasso. It's the longest staircase in Europe. It's part of a track linking Valstagna in the Brenta valley and Sasso on the Asiago plateau. The track was commisioned by a XIV c. duke of Feltre (and most of the Po valley) Gian Galeazzo Visconti to comfortably bring down trees from the plateau to the valley. Valstagna is a quite picturesque little town squished on the left side of Brenta, dating back to XI-XII c.\n\nValstagna.\n\nCalà del Sasso.\n\nI won't be doing any Monte Grappa ascents as the stage is already quite long, so the first 47km are in the very picturesque Brenta and Valsugana alongside the ancient Via Claudia Augusta. This valley ride ends in Borgo Valsugana, which is home to the 1st intermediate sprint (in the frazzione of Castelnuovo).\n\nMonte Grappa.\n\nThe Brenta valley includes some very high rocky walls. I could consider it a gorge. There's even a 1km high wall of Sassorosso (1195m), Monte Cismon (1588m) and Cima Lasta/Monte Mèzza (1679m) that drops down straight into Strada Valsugana (SS47). On these local hilltops you can find old military forts from before WW1, when it was a border between Italy and Austro-Hungary.\n\nCima Lasta/Monte Mèzza (1679m).\n\nBrenta valley north of Bassano del Grappa.\n\nThe most interesting fort in the valley is defintely Covolo di Butistone near Cismon del Grappa. It was a small X c. castle that's built in a cave above the valley. It was destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars and commisioned by Napoleon himself to be dismantled. Cismon itself is the oldest village in the valley, dating back to XII c. In the middle ages the area was part of the Republic of Venice, besides a short period during the XVI c. War of the League of Cambrai when it was in possesion of nearby County of Tirol. In Cismon del Grappa starts a 70km long bike bath Ciclopista della Valsugana towards Levico Terme, which covers the ancient Via Claudia Augusta. In nearby Primolano the stage enters Trentino.\n\nCismon del Grappa.\n\nGrigno.\n\nThe flat part of the stage ends in Borgo Valsugana. It's the largest town of Valsugana. The name of the valley derives from the Roman name of the town \"Ausugum\", when it was a stop on Via Claudia Augusta – a transalpine Roman road linking Altino (antique Venice) with Augusta (Augsburg) in Germany via Passo Resia and Fernpass in Austria. Because of the road the valley was strategically quite important. In the middle ages it was in the middle of long lasting tensions between the prince-bishopry of Trento and the county of Feltre, to which the valley belonged to. Since 1413 Borgo Valsugana belonged to the county of Tirol, close to the border with the Venice Republic. This borderland situation lasted to WW1, when Borgo Valsugana and the town of Telve (just above Borgo, en route to Passo Manghen) where part of a \"no man's land\" between entrenched armies.\n\nCovolo di Butistone.\n\nThe modern Borgo Valsugana is a relatively fresh town. It was destroyed by a freak fire in 1862 and WW1. Back then the town's archtecture was mainly wooden Alpine huts so not much had been left. Just outside of the town is the XIII c. Castel Telvana – once a fort over Via Claudia Augusta and an administrative center of the valley. The name derives from the town of Telve, just above Borgo Valsugana. Borgo Valsugana is also the birthplace of a certain Matteo Trentin and also the entrance to a certain Passo Manghen.\n\nCastel Telvana, Borgo Valsugana.\n\nI guess you know Manghen quite well. It's part of the Lagorai Occidentale – the southernmost massif of the Fiemme Dolomites. This might be the southernmost paved mountain pass of the Dolomites and also the southernmost over 2000m pass of Alpi Sud-orientali and maybe the entire Eastern Alps system (besides maybe Dosso dei Galli). Manghen is the only trans-Lagorai pass directly linking Valsugana with Val di Fiemme. It splits the Monte Croce group to the west with Cima d'Asta to the east. Of course it's part of the Sportful/Campagnolo granfondo race. I hope the road will be someday repaired after the October/November torrential rains.\n\nProfile of Passo Manghen.\n\nLago Cadinello at the top of Passo Manghen.\n\nI may bring a closer look at the normally descended and sort of neglected northern side of the pass, which is only slightly easier than the other side. It's 13km at 8,5% with the last 8km at very regular 9,7% (max 11-12%). If the south side will be repaired then you could think of a tricky descent finish in either Telvo or Borgo Valsugana. Combine it with Lavaze from Bolzano and you would have a quite demanding two-peak mountain stage.\n\nPasso Manghen from Molina di Fiemme.\n\nMonte Croce di Lagorai (2490m).\n\nI assume Val di Fiemme doesn't need any further explanation and i'm only brushing it via Molina di Fiemme for a large detour down to Alto Adige and a small visit in Bolzano before going back to Val di Fiemme from north. In Molina di Fiemme (a village just west of Cavalese) i'll be heading via SS48 into Ora (Auer) roughly halfway between Trento and Bolzano.\n\nOra / Auer.\n\nThe descent is in a local Val d'Ora, which starts in the village of Redagno (Radein) just below Passo Oclini – the finish of this stage. There is a road from Redagno to Oclini, but it's on a quite ruff dirt. Even if apparently it's possible to do it with a road bike i decided to not do it, mainly because of its popularity. You may also know the area for Trodena (Truden), a decent climb right in the middle of Monte Corno range that's adjacent to the valley. The climb is often used as an extension of Oclini. Starting from Ora there are 27km of flat, which includes going through Bolzano. The final part of the stage will start in Prato Isarco with Obergummer.\n\nBolzano.\n\nXIII c. Castel Cornedo/Schloss Karneid, Cornedo all'Isarco/Karneid.\n\nObergummer or San Valentino di Sopra (a quite rare case of the German variant being easier to remember) should be well known to you. It's one of those Alto Adige muritos concentrated around the Bolzano area. It's the westernmost part of the Latemar group and also the northernmost part of the Fiemme Dolomites, bordering Seiser Alm (Sciliar-Catinaccio or Schlern-Rosengarten) to the north and east. It's located between the Ega valley (Lavazè & Costalunga) to the south and the Tires valley to the north (Nigra).\n\nSciliar-Catinaccio / Schlern-Rosengarten.\n\nThere are three versions of this climb. From south, starting in the Ega valley is the easiest variant including plenty of harpins and the village of San Valentino In Campo or Gummer. This variant is 6,7km at 7,8% (max 12% at the bottom). This one will be descended. The road is relatively wide and in nice condition, but its technicality makes it quite difficult. From north is the side i gonna be climbing.\n\nOne of the harpins on the descent from Obergummer.\n\nThe variant i'm taking starts in Prato Isarco or Blumau, near Bolzano. It's a climb composed of two distinct halfs. The first half is the steeper section of the climb with 7km at relatively regular 9,8% that includes a 1km at roughly 11% (max 12-14%). This part is very twisty with the first 4km having 16 harpins.\n\nVery twisty opening of Obergummer.\n\nThe other half are the last 5km from the top at a much milder but also more irregular 6,6% including some small parts of 11-13%. Overall, it's 12,3km at 8,3%, making it the first proper HC climb of the race. The road is mostly wide and in good condition. The area is mostly covered in foliege, but it does sparsely open up to showcase some quality outlook of the Sciliar-Catinaccio group.\n\nProfile of San Valentino di Sopra / Obergummer.\n\nSciliar-Catinaccio seen from Obergummer.\n\nThe last variant is a narrow track from Cardano (Kardaun) – a suburb of Bolzano. While i'm associating it with Obergummer, it tops roughly 5km before the village on a local hill Dosso di Monte Larice (1223m). This side is roughly 10,3km at fairly regular 9% followed by a 5km plateau.\n\nProfile of Obergummer from Cardano.\n\nAt the top is the village of Obergummer or San Valentino di Sopra. It's part of a larger muncipality of San Valentino in Campo or Gummer. The \"sopra\" part of the village is in the middle of a local hilltop, quite densly forested Rosengarten plateau while the main village is roughly half-way down the slope.\n\nSan Valentino in Campo.\n\nWhen reaching the Ega below San Valentino in Campo there are roughly 2km of flase-flat to Ponte Nova or Birchabruck, when the valley splits into two – to the east towards Costalunga and to the south towards Lavazè. We're taking the south variant but only for 1km before entering a side valley of San Nicolo. All of the roads here are quite major so they're wide and on good surface.\n\nWhen reaching the San Nicolo valley starts a demanding murito to San Floriano d'Ega or Ega di Sopra (Obereggen). The climb is one of two possibilities of reaching Passo Pampeago / Reiterjoch from north, so you can count it as half-Reiterjoch. The other side that starts in Novale (Rauth) will be descended. The side the peloton will climb may as well be the steepest climb of the whole Giro with the last 5km at rather intimidating 11,7% (max 16% in the very middle) besides the very last 1km at roughly 7%. Overall it's 6,9km at 10%, quite similar to Fedaia. It's a borderline cat. 2/1 climb. I've downgraded it to cat. 2 as i will have a surplus of cat. 1 in the race.\n\nProfile of San Floriano / Obereggen (only to the eponymous sign).\n\nThe road is wide, on nice surface and is sort of a more typical to the German school of mountain roads – very straight roads discarding the slope. I mean only in Germany and Austra you have major roads reaching 20%. Thanks to its location right at the bottom of the Latemar group Obereggen has some nice views of the massif.\n\nThe road towards Obereggen in San Nicolo d'Ega.\n\nThe climb was used at least once in 1998 during the stage 18 to Alpe Pampeago, which was a street battle between Pantani and Tonkov. At first i've mistaken it for the stage, where Pantani did 1:30 on Simoni, but that was a year later. It was also the last stage, when Alex Zülle was in contention for the GC podium before faltering down the ladder Yates-style. If i remember correctly Zülle was very unstable and that wasn't his first sudden big loss but maybe i'm mistaking him with Olano as both had quite similar racing profiles.\n\nProfile of the 1998 Pampeago stage.\n\nThe Latemar massif is the closest looking to typical Dolomiti range of the Fiemme Dolomites. No wonder as it's the closest range to the Marmolada/Sella groups. The range split from closely afiliated Catinaccio/Rosengarten group to the north by Passo Costalunga. The highest peak is Cimon del Latemar at 2842m. The massif is mainly known for Alpe and Passo Pampeago.\n\nLatemar.\n\nThe descent from Obereggen was featured in the 2012 stage that also went to Alpe Pampeago. Back then it was part of a larger descent from Passo Pampeago/Reiterjoch. It was the stage, where Kreuziger went on Lavazè to then win the stage and condemn his rather abysmal GC campaign. Roughly 30s behind him was Hesjedal beating Purito by 16s and those gains proved to be ultimately crucial in winning the whole race, making him the only Canadian to win a GT. The descent is only 3km long, quite steep (9-11%), mostly straight and wide. Even with the steepness it shouldn't be considered to be too difficult.\n\nProfile of the descent from Obereggen, only to the Novale/Rauth sign.\n\nLike in 2012, the stage starts to climb Lavazè in Novale. However, this time Lavazè won't be categorised as it will be part of a larger ascent that can only be Passo Oclini/Grimmjoch. Passo Oclini is the highest (at least partly) paved road of the Weißhorn (2318m), just west of Latemar. Passo Lavazè is the border between both massifs. Weißhorn or Corno Bianco is 2318m high. However, it's not the highest peak of this massif. The neighboring Schwarzhorn or Corno Nero is the highest peak at 2439m. Passo Oclini lies between both mountains.\n\nCorno Bianco / Weißhorn.\n\nCorno Nero / Schwarzhorn.\n\nPasso Oclini (1989m) is quite popular on this forum thanks to it's western dirt side. However, Oclini is also a small ski resort, that belongs to Cavalese which is just to the south. There's some space not only at the top but also at the top of Lavazè and in Cavalese itself so i hope that the finish won't be that big of a logistical nightmare.\n\nPasso and Lago di Lavazè.\n\nPasso Oclini and Corno Bianco seen from above.\n\nPasso Oclini is the easiest climb of the day. While the preceeding Obereggen should be cat. 1, Oclini is the only proper non cat. 1 climb of the stage. That doesn't mean it's not difficult as the last 2,5km below Lavazè are at 11% (max 13%). However, the last 3,5km from Lavazè are at fairly regular 5,2% with only a short stint near the finish at 8%. Overall, it's 10,3km at 6,9%. The road to Lavazè is obviously wide and in good quality while the extension to Oclini is slightly narrower and in a bit worser state.\n\nProfile of Passo Oclini / Grimmjoch (from Rauth / Novale sign).\n\nSo, the last 40km are mostly uphill with each climb getting slightly easier and easier. In terms of height it's sort of a crescendo, while in terms of difficulty it's decrescendo. There's hardly any flat between the climbs and the descents are qute steep and tricky (especially the first one). I guess Obergummer will provide a quite large selection while Obereggen will left only the main GC pundits with maybe one gregario for each. I guess the main action will be provided by the first steep kms of Lavazè. Because of Oclini's profle i expect the time splits between the main GC favourites to not be too big but the next group can earn quite sizeable loses and if you're in trouble on Obereggen then i guess you can wave goodbye to your GC chances. I guess Manghen mid-stage may provide some trouble for the grupetto to finish within the time limit.\n\nThis stage is preceded by the queen stage of the race, that will feature an additional amount of Alto Adige muritos, but this time there will be no Bolzano in sight. There will be also a small cameo of the \"main\" Dolomites, but no Fedaia.\n\nI consider it to be the queen stage of the race.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/213190\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 15. Predazzo. Val di Fiemme – Valles. Gitschberg Jochtal, 187km, mountain.\n\nClimbs:\n\nPasso Sella / Sellajoch – 11km, 7,2%, cat. 2, 2244m\n\nPasso Gardena / Grödnerjoch – 5,6km, 4,4%, cat. 4, 2121m\n\nAntermola / Untermoi – 5,9km, 8,1% (max 16%), cat. 2, 1559m\n\nPasso delle Erbe / Würzjoch – 6,3km, 9,4% (max 12%), cat. 2, 1987m\n\nAlpe Rodengo / Rodenecker Alm – 7,7km, 11% (max 14-15%), cat. 1, 1715m\n\nForcella delle Cave / Kieneralm – 9,5km, 9% (max 16-17%), cat. 1, 1741m\n\nValles / Vals – 6,2km, 4,1% (max 10%), cat. 4, 1371m\n\nOriginally the start was in Cavalese but i decided to shorten it and start from Predazzo, manly known for Trampolino Dal Bien – the main Italian ski jump. Of course the stage will feature plenty of winter venues, mainly Val Gardena and Alta Badia. Throughout this stage i'll be mostly using the Italian names. Alto Adige is a bilingual region with the majority of population being German, but i found the Italian to be much easier in writing.\n\nCima Valbona (2842m), Latemar Group, Val di Fiemme.\n\nSass de Putia (2875m).\n\nThe stage takes place mainly in the northwestern part of Dolomites like the Latemar group (2842m) or Dolomiti di Gardena and later flirting with the southern edges of the Zillertaler Alps. Dolomiti di Gardena is mainly the Sella group (3152m), Puez-Odle group (3025m), Sassolungo group (3181m) and Plose-Putia group (2875m). The latter half of the stage ventures into the southern edges of the Zillertaler massif, mainly the Fundres group including Wilde Kreuzspitze (Picco della Croce, 3135m) or Hochfeiler (Gran Pilastro, 3510m).\n\nSella (3152m).\n\nSassolungo (3181m).\n\nYou can associate the Sella group (Sellagruppe) with Passo Sella (Sellajoch) and Passo Gardena (Grödnerjoch), Puez-Odle (Puez-Geislerspitzen) and Sassolungo (Langkofel, Alpe di Siusi) with Passo Eores, Plose-Putia with Alpe Rodengo (Rodenecker Alm) and the Fundres group with Forcella delle Cave (Kieneralm).\n\nPicco della Croce (Wilde Kreuzspitze).\n\nHochfeiler (Gran Pilastro).\n\nI don't think these mountains need any more space as i guess you know them very well. I also expect you to know a lot about these cols. However, i may argue that Fedaia ain't that special. I know Libertine has an instant peak just on the pure sound of this pass but i don't get the hype. All of the Dolomiti passes (going as far south as Passo Duran) are mostly very picturesque thanks to the distinct shape of local peaks but besides Serrai di Sottoguda, which is just a good looking gorge (nothing out of this world) it's nothing outstanding. I will argue that the best looking pass in the area might be Passo Sella as it goes straight through the \"pipe organs\" of the Sella group.\n\nPasso Sella.\n\nOf course the stage will partly cover the Sella Ronda – a ski/cycling path running around the Sella group consisting of Passo Sella, Passo Gardena, Passo Pordoi and Passo Campolongo. Starting from Canazei Sella is 11km at 7,2%, a strong cat. 2. It's immediately followed by the two-stepped ascent of Passo Gardena (here a cat. 4). Of course the stage will pass through both famous alpine skiing venues of Selva Val Gardena (Wolkenstein in Gröden) and Corvara Alta Badia (Kurfar in Hochabtei).\n\nPasso Sella.\n\nCorvara Alta Badia with the Sassongher peak (2665m).\n\nInterestingly, because of their rather remote location throughout the history the Ladin language (possbly an offshoot of the Rhaeto-Romance group) is still preserved. I'm not sure about this as my knowledge of alpine skiing is nonexistend but it seems the skiing culture in the region dates back to the early 70's. I guess worth mentioning might be the ruins of a medieval Castel Wolkenstein built within a rockface near Selva Val Gardena. It dates back to XIII-XIV c.\n\nCastel Wolkenstein, Selva Val Gardena.\n\nAfter a 20km false-descend towards San Martino in Badia the peloton will start the two-stepped ascent of Erbe. This time i've chosen the Antermola variant. While i decided to split the ascent into two i guess you could also treat it as one. I could had used the classic Longega/Zwischenwasser side an considering the theme of this stage is the Alto-Adige muritos maybe i should go that way. Then i guess it would be a cat. 1 ascent as the mid-descent is shorter.\n\nPasso delle Erbe with Antermola.\n\nI'm doing Erbe because the main part of the stage will be just east of the Isarco valley, which is on the other side of the Puez-Odle group. I guess it's because the road to Erbe is quite narrow that lately this pass isn't seen too often in cycling. The descend to Bressanone (Brixen) is very long and leads through the Gunggan plateau (where the Erbe and Eores climbs meet) and the false-flat of Eores (Kofeljoch). The main descend starts in Plancios (Valcroce) after roughly 14km and it lasts for another 15km at mostly 7%.\n\nPasso delle Erbe from Longega/Zwischenwasser.\n\nOriginally i was doing only Sella and then the stage was supposed to descend down to the Isarco valley and ascend almost the full Eores from Chiesa / Klausen (SP163) via the Funes (Villnöss or Villnöß) valley. It goes through picturesque villages of San Pietro and Santa Maddalena di Funes, which is home to a XIV c. church Chiesa di San Giovanni in Ranui (Johanneskapelle). The road is rather narrow but mostly open, with beautiful outlook of the Puez-Odle group.\n\nSanta Maddalena di Funes (Sankt Magdalena in Villnöß).\n\nThis variation is roughly 20km at quite irregular 6,7%, an ok HC climb. This includes a 6km in the middle at roughly 9% and at least one to two small false-flats mixed with some small over 10% ramps (max 14%). It can be either part of Erbe or you may descend down to Bressanone roughly 3km before the top (at roughly 1740m alt). I wouldn't recommend descending via this side as the road is rather narrow.\n\nProfile of Erbe via the Funes valley.\n\nThe town of Bressanone (Brixen) is the largest town of the Isarco valley (2nd is Vipiteno/Sterzing) with 20000 inhabitants. The town was founded in 901 by the monks from nearby Roman village of Sabiona (Säben) and it's abbey that dates back to at least VI c. They got the rights to found the new town from the Carolingian king Louis III the Child. It was at the time when modern Germany and northern Italy were part of East Francia created by Charlemagne.\n\nSabiona (Säben).\n\nIn the early middle ages Brixen was a prince-bishopry (like neighboring Trento) but later it struggled against the quickly arising power of Tyrol. However, it was only abolished in 1803 and fully annexed by the Austrian Empire. The Holy-Roman Emperor Henry II invested heavily in the bishopry, giving them the whole Venosta valley to ensure they're on his side during the Investiture struggle. In 1080 a synod was held in the town in which the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV managed to put Clement III as the antipope against Gregory VII. After the WW1 Brixen was annexed by Italy.\n\nPiazza Duomo, Bressanone.\n\nMain sights are the Duomo (Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta e San Cassiano / Dom Mariae Aufnahme in den Himmel und Sankt Kassian) dating back to XIV c. and often suffered from fires, XI c. Chiesa di San Michele (Pfarrkirche Sankt Michael), XVI c. Palazzo Vescovile – former bishop's palace, XII c. Castello Pallhaus and some remains of the XI c. city walls with three gates – Sabiona (Säbener Tor), San Michele (Sankt Michaelstor) and Sole (Sonnentor). Just north of Brien is the Novacella (Neustft) Abbey. It was founded by the bishop of Brixen Hartmann in 1142. The abbey is also home to a private school run since basically the abbey's foundation.\n\nDuomo di Bressanone.\n\nPorta Sabiona, Bressanone.\n\nAbbazia di Novacella.\n\nIn Brixen i'm entering the Luson (Lüsen) valley, which cuts through the Plose group. Of course the main hub of this valley is the village of Luson just below Alpe Rodengo (Rodeneck Alm). Alpe Rodengo is topped by a XII c. manor house Castello di Rodengo (Schloss Rodenegg) later modernized in XVI c. by a troubadier Oswald von Wolkenstein. Unlike the recent Trentino/Tour of the Alps stage i'm not going to the village but leaving the main road just before it.\n\nCastello di Rodengo.\n\nFrom here i want to introduce you to a 3rd side of Alpe Rodengo. Technically it starts when leaving the main Luson road just before the village but the main climb starts after a roughly 3km ride alongside the Luson river. The road (which is called Kreuznerberg) is very narrow. Not counting the first 2-3km on a false-flat the last 7,7km are at mostly stable 11% (max 14-15%). That makes it sort of a half-Mortirolo. While climbing there are 15 quite tight harpins. I've checked if Libertine mentioned it in his dissection of the climb but it seems he didn't or i just missed it with my rather sloppy eyes.\n\nProfile of Alpe Rodengo.\n\nThe road of Alpe Rodengo.\n\nThe descent to Rio Pusteria (Mühlbach) is 11km at 8,9%. The same side was recently descended in Trentino/Adige/Alpes/etc. It's definitely a difficult descent with a not that wide road and plenty of turns and sweeps. There are at least 10 harpins or larger turns. It's a demanding descent but definitely not the most difficult of the last 10 years (Trivigno north, Cason di Lanza). The descent is fairly regular with slopes at mostly 8-9%. There are however two very small false-flats and a roughly 4km section in the middle at 10% (max 14%).\n\nProfile of the descent from Alpe Rodengo.\n\nThe Luson valley seen from the higher slopes of Alpe Rodengo.\n\nRio di Pusteria (Mühlbach) is the main hub of the Gitschberg Jochtal ski area (main ski centers are Valles and Maranza). It's on the very north of Italy, just east of Vipiteno/Sterzing and Brennero. I think this ski area is considered to be the northernmost part of the Dolomiti Superski consortium, which basically covers everything between Belluno and Brunico (includng Alta Badia and Gardena) even if this ski area is the southernmost part of the Zillertaler Alps (Alpi Aurine).\n\nRio di Pusteria (Mühlbach).\n\nXIII c. Chiusa di Rio di Pusteria.\n\nThe Gitschberg Jochtal area is a fresh creation, dating back to 2011. It consists mainly of Gitschberg (Monte Cuzzo, 2512m) and Monte Domenar (2718m), all of them part of the slopes of Wilde Kreuzspitze (3132m). There are of course smaller peaks Monte delle Cave (Grubenkopf, 1827m) just above Maranza. Just west of this peak is a minor col Forcella delle Cave (Kieneralm), which will be the last major climb of the day. However, to reach it's hardest side i need to borrow a roughly 3,5km of Via Pusteria and then have a roughly 7km stint in the Fundres valley (Vallarga) starting from Vandoies di Sotto (Niedervintl).\n\nMeransen, Gitschberg Jochtal.\n\nThe aforementioned Kieneralm is the main pass inside Gitschberg Jochtal. It's located just above Maranza and Rio di Pusteria. Like with Rodengo there are three sides – from Rio di Pustera, Vandoies di Sotto (at the base of Terento) and Vallarga. From Rio di Pusteria it's 13,3km at 7,2% (strong cat. 1) and from Vandoies di Sotto it's 11,3km at 8,5% (low HC). Both sides merge roughly 2,3km before the top. I'm however doing the 3rd option from Vallarga, which i think might be the hardest optionof all. Theoretically the Vandoies side is the hardest but then i couldn't do the full climb andit doesn't have the nasty percentages the Vallarga side has.\n\nProfile of Cave from Rio di Pusteria.\n\nI've also chosen the Vallarga side because the Rio di Pusteria side is the widest and the most refined with the Vandoies one being very smilar to that Alpe Rodengo variant i've used. So, now to the maths. The climb is 9,5km at 9%. It includes the middle 4km at roughly 12% with slopes reaching the heights of 16-17%. Just after this murito is a roughly 1,5km on flase-flat before the last 4km at relatively stable 9,6%. Ultimately it's not as difficult as Rodengo, but the middle 4km may provide plenty of action. The road is mostly narrow and seems to be in okay-ish shape.\n\nProfile of Kieneralm.\n\nRoad to Kieneralm.\n\nThe Rio di Pusteria side is the descent. It's slightly wider and more refined but it's still dangerous and technical with 14 harpins. The descent ends 3km above Rio di Pusteria, when the peloton will move deep into the Zillertaler entering the Valles (Vals) valley after a tunnel. The road to Valles is wide and on smooth surface. The last 6,4km in the valley are irregulary uphill.\n\nThe descent of Kieneralm.\n\nThe top of Kieneralm is 17km from the finish line. The top of Alpe Rodengo is 47km from the finish line. They're reinforced by decent cat. 2 or 1 (here cat. 2) climbs of Sella and Erbe. Between Rodengo and Cave there's 10km of valley. Consdering the difficulty of both climbs i guess the last 50km can turn out to be very interesting and i guess the differences between the groups may be quite large. I'm not expecting the return of let's say Chianale 2003 but i hope it may turn out to be one of the better stages in Giro's recent history.\n\nValle di Valles (Valler Tal).\n\nThe finish line is just above the village of Valles. The village is home to Jochtal ski, part of the Gitschberg Jochtal ski area. The valley goes quite deep into the Zillertaler and ends just below Wilde Kreuzspitze. The climb to Valles is similar to a ladder – small steeper parts of 7-9% mixed with periods of false-flat. The hardest part is 1,3km in the village at roughly 10% and it ends 1km before the finish. While a rather obscure ski resort it has more than plenty of open space to house the finish.\n\nProfile of Valles, starting from the Maranza sign and w/o the last murito.\n\nXIV c. Chiesa di Sant'Andrea, renovated in late XIX c. Valles.\n\nAfter the rest-day in Alto Adige the next stage will start in Vipiteno/Sterzing and it'll be sort of a homage to the Jafferau 2018 stage.\n\nI realized i have a shortage of stages starting with a big climb and the peloton doesn't like to have huge hurdles right from the go. However, i feel such stage best work when they're rather short as then it can promote bolder GC moves. Here the large flat of the lower Venosta and the impending giant of Stelvio should neutralize any early GC threat.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/219567\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 16. Vipiteno / Sterzing – Resia / Reschen am See. Val Venosta, 197km, mountain.\n\nClimbs:\n\nPasso Monte Giovo / Jaufenpass – 15km, 7,5% (max 10%), cat. 1, 2094m\n\nTanas / Vinschgauer Höhenstraße – 8km, 8,2% (max 13%), cat. 2, 1573m\n\nPasso dello Stelvio / Stilfserjoch – 23km, 7,8% (max 12%), Cima Coppi, 2758m\n\nAlsago / Alsack – 9km, 7% (max 14%), cat. 2, 1538m\n\nThe Monte Giovo/Jaufenpass here is mostly cosmetic as you can tell Stelvio will be all the rage. I guess you can also tell the stage is inspired by the Froome plant going Chernobyl on them pawns this/last year (wrote that piece just before the new year's eve). Worry not, i'm not expecting the same kind of racing on this stage.\n\nThere were three main reasons for me to have Monte Giovo early on – Bolzano on the Val di Fiemme stage, Bressanone on the Valles stage and lack of stages with big climbs at or near the start. The race visited a number of relatively large towns in Alto Adige and Vipiteno/Sterzing is the only one absent here. Because the town is at the bottom of Monte Giovo it means the climb is very early. That also does open up more possibilities for Val Venosta.\n\nProfile of Passo di Monte Giovo.\n\nLater on i've also realized the profile is not far from a typical Stelvio-Livigno stage. Last time seen in 2005. I think that stage was also the last time the Prato side was climbed. I do however know that Foscagno is on paper slightly tougher than Alsago as even if my choice has higher percentages, it's also significantly shorter. If my memory is correct the aforementioned Livigno stage was also the one where Basso has his teeth problems and rounded up the stage with the groupetto.\n\nProfile of the 2005 Livigno stage.\n\nVipiteno/Sterzing is the least Italian town of Italy. The region is almost 100% populated by Germans. It's the chief town of Wipptal or Alta Valle Isarco – the upper portion of Isarco, the main tributary of Adige. The upper part starts just below Sterzing and ends at Brennero. In antiquity it was a military camp on then fresh Via Raetia, which went to Raetia (modern Bavaria) via Brennero. The modern Sterzing was founded by Duke Meinhard of Carinthia as a trading center on then crucial Brennero. It was also a silver mining hub tied to nearby Ridanna (Ridnaun) and Fleres (Pflersch) valleys. In 1443 a fire destroyed part of the city. The destroyed part was quickly rebuilt and now it's called Neustadt, while the old part is Altstadt. Just after WW2 a number of wanted Nazis were waiting in local Hotel Goldenes Kreuz for forged passports to Brazil and Argentina.\n\nVipiteno/Sterzing.\n\nVia Gänsbacher and XV c. Torre delle Dodici/Zwölferturm, Vipiteno/Sterzing.\n\nMain sights include XV c. Chiesa della Madonna della Palude/Unsere liebe Frau im Moos Kerk, early XV c. Chiesa di Santo Spirito, 46m high Zwölferturm/Torre delle Dodici that was built in 1470 to separate the old town (Altstadt) from the new town (Neustadt) after that 1443 fire, XV c. town hall (Rathaus), XVI c. manor house Palazzo Jöchlsthurn and XIII-XV c. Castel Tasso/Burg Reifenstein in Campo di Trens/Freienfeld near Sterzing.\n\nCastel Tasso/Burg Reifenstein, Campo di Trens/Freienfeld.\n\nThe majority of the stage will take place in the Venosta/Vinschgau valley created by the upper Adige, which has its sources below Passo Resia – a transalpine pass on the Austro-Italian border that ends the valley. The valley splits the Ortler Alps (Ortles-Cevedale) to the south from Ötztal Alps (Alpi Venoste) to the north. The main towns in the valley are Naturno/Naturns, Silandro/Schlanders and Malles/Mals. The valley ends at Curon/Graun and adjacent to it Lago di Resia/Reschensee renown for its partly submerged bell tower. The valley is also renown for its marble quarries (mainly near Laas/Lasa).\n\nPanorama of Val Venosta with Alpi Venoste/Ötztaler Alpen in the background.\n\nThe main road of Venosta is of Austrian origin and dates back to 1850's. However, the valley was a major transalpine route as far back as the Roman Empire, when the Via Claudia Augusta went there. It was one of two main transalpine routes linking Italy with Raetia (modern Bavaria). The other one was Via Raetia through Brennero.\n\nMerano with Val Venosta and Alpi Venoste in the background.\n\nVenosta should also be known as the origins of what's now Tirol/Tyrol. The medieval county of Tyrol orignates from an eponymous castle above Merano, established in XII c. by an eponymous family. It later belonged to the house of Gorizia, Wittelsbachs and since 1362 the Habsburgs. With Styria and Carinthia it created the modern Austria. Before the county of Tyrol the valley belonged to the bishops of Brixen/Bressanone. The castle felt into obscurity in 1420 after archduke Frederick IV Habsburg moved the capital to Innsbruck.\n\nXII c. Tirol Schloss/Castello di Tirolo, Merano.\n\nOther characteristic to Val Venosta castle is Castel Juval or Juval Schloss above Senales/Schnalstal. This manor house dates back to XIII c. but the modern appearance is from early XX c. when it was renovated by William Rowland. Now it's a residence of mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who created a mountain museum dedicated to important in mythology peaks like Olympus, Ararat, Sinai etc.\n\nCastel Juval.\n\nVenosta is not renown for having ancient towns with intricate history. Most of them date back to late gothic or early reinassance. The oldest surviving structure seems to be a tiny rural Chiesa di San Procolo/Sankt-Prokulus-Kirche near Naturno/Naturns that dates back to VIII-IX c. It's home to invaluable Carolingian frescoes of VIII-IX c. Other ancient structure is Chiesa di San Benedetto/Sankt-Benedikt-Kirche in Malles/Mals that also dates back to the Carolingian period. It's also home to the examples of Carolingian frescoes.\n\nChiesa di San Procolo/Sankt-Prokulus-Kirche, Naturno/Naturns.\n\nChiesa di San Benedetto/Sankt-Benedikt-Kirche, Malles/Mals.\n\nThe largest and possibly the oldest towns in the valley are Malles and Silandro, both of Celtic origins and later stops on Via Claudia Augusta. Near Malles is Burgusio, which is home to XII c. Abbazia di Monte Maria and associated with it XIII c. Castello del Principe. The abbey is considered to be the highest Benedictine abbey in Europe located at 1335m. It was founded by the bishops of Chur in 780-786, possibly on behalf of Charlemagne. From the get go it was closely associated with its sister Abbazia di San Giovanni in Val Müstair. The modern structure originates from XII c. by Von Tarasp family from Tarasp in lower Engandina (next stage), when they moved the old monastery to Scuol near Tarasp. The abbey was decimated by the Black Death with only four monks surviving. Since 1724 the abbey operates a humanistic high school in Merano.\n\nAbbazia di Monte Maria/Abtei Marienberg, Burgusio/Burgeis.\n\nThe abbey with Castello del Principe.\n\nStelvio from any side and especially from Prato doesn't need any additional help and the location of the climb means only the easiest side from Bormio can dream of any larger attachments (mainly Gavia – 2013/2014 Val Martello). The Prato side starts right in the middle of a large valley l'Alpe style but there's a small climb right on the other side of the valley to a local hillside village of Tanas. I've did an investigation on the climb and i can tell the more interesting eastern (Lasa) side is wider and in better quality. That was rather unexpected for me. That would mean if you would think of doing it in real life then the easier western side from Sluderno should be the climbed one. If approaching it from upper Venosta that would be fine but if you (like me right now) approach it from Alto Adige then it's rather inconvienent.\n\nThe climb to Tanas with some glimpses of Val Venosta below.\n\nBelow you'll see, why i think Tanas should be climbed from the other side.\n\nDescent from Tanas.\n\nThe climb to Tanas is quite demanding. It consists of one big climb with a little cherry on top after a 1km flat. The main chunk are the first 5km at 10,1% (max 13-14%) and it kicks off instanly with an entire 1km at 11,1%. The aforementioned cherry is the last 1,5km at 7,3% with a roughly 700m at 9-10%. Overall it's 8km at 8,2%, a good cat. 1 and a very strong Giro cat. 2 (potentially borderline cat. 1). The descent is easier with the first 6km at 4,2%, barely reaching 6% in places. The last 4,5km are way tougher at 8,8% with 1,5km in the middle at 10,5% (short bursts of 13-14%). The descent ends in Sluderno/Schluderns, roughly 6km before the bottom of Stelvio.\n\nProfile of Tanas.\n\nProfile of the descent from Tanas.\n\nStelvio starts after roughly 6km of valley. It's hard for me to believe the Prato side was last ascended in 2005 (en route to Livigno). Stelvio-Mortirolo or Stelvio-Livigno are no brainers, yet last time it was Umbrail that was ascended. I have nothing aganst that though as Umbrail itself is a very good climb and in terms of difficulty Umbrail side of Stelvio is not far from the Prato side. However, for this stage i deemed the Prato side to be more logical, which i think should mean the full Umbrail side would be descended for the first time in Giro's history. For training pros and amateurs it's nothing new as the Umbrail side is the most popular descent route from Stelvio. While theoretically not as difficult as the descent to Prato, it's still very twisty and demanding with a large number of back to back harpins. There are also some narrower bits in Santa Maria Val Müstair. I assume it'll be pretty wet/snowy, which means you can theoretically gain big chunks of time if you feel adventurous (or lucky – Quintana 2014).\n\nProfile of Stelvio.\n\nThe main descent ends in Val Müstair but a slight downhill continues for the next roughly 10km, where the race will come back to Italy and Val Venosta. Val Müstair or Val Monastero in Italian is a side valley of Venosta that ends at the Ofenpass/Passo del Fuorno in the Svizzer National Park. The valley is part of the canton of Grisons. With Samnaun in lower Engandina it's the easternmost region of Switzerland.\n\nVal Müstair.\n\nThe main river of the valley is Rom/Rombach but the name of Val Müstair derives from Abbazia di San Giovanni or Kloster Sankt Johann. It's a Benedictine monastery founded by the bishops of Chur in 775 possbly on behalf of Charlemagne, who just managed to capture Grisons. The modern facility is from XII c. The abbey is renown for its Carolingian frescoes from VII-VIII c. and Romanesque art from XII c. which earned it a spot in the UNESCO WHS. As you also probably know thanks to LS elaborations, Dario Cologna comes from the valley.\n\nAbbazia di San Giovanni/Kloster Sankt Johann, Müstair.\n\nThe last climb of the stage starts in Glorenza/Glurns below Malles Venosta, where both valleys join. Glurns was founded around XII c. and soon it was elevated to a city status while possibly having less than 100 inhabitants, making it one of the smallest if not the smallest city within the modern borders of Italy. The upper Venosta and Müstair (that includes both abbeys) were ravaged by the XV-XVI c. Swabian War between the Habsburgs and the Swiss confederation, which created what's now the modern Switzerland. During said war the village was completely razed. This incident was the main rason to enclosure the village with walls. These walls stay intact to this day. From air it looks like a little Murten. It's worth noting the passage through the village includes some very light cobbles and one very short and narrow section under a city gate.\n\nGlorenza/Glurns.\n\nFrom Glurns i'm using a shortcut of SP85 that directly leads to Malles. It's the lowest part of Passo Resia/Reschenpass – the main pass of Val Venosta. Passo Resia/Reschenpass links the Italian Val Venosta to the south with the joint Suisse/Austrian Inn valley to the north. It also splits two major Alpine ranges Alpi Venoste/Ötztaler Alpen to the east and the Sesvenna Alps (highest peak – Piz Sesvenna at 3221m) to the west. Because of it's strategic location and low altitude (1500m) Passo Resia was with the Brennero the main transalpine track during the ancient Rome. It was part of Via Claudia Augusta. At that time it was just a steep straight. The modern, very distinct road with its 6 wide switchbacks was built in 1850's.\n\nPasso Resia with its two main lakes Lago di San Valentino and Lago di Resia.\n\nPiz Sesvenna.\n\nBecause i'm using a shortcut i'm dodging Sluderno/Schluderns. Above the town is Castel Coira/Churburg. This castle was commisioned in 1260 by the bishop of Chur but it soon fell into the hands of the counts of Tirol. The castle is mainly nown for its large armory museum considered to be one of most important in Europe.\n\nCastel Coira/Churburg, Sluderno/Schluderns.\n\nMalles Venosta.\n\nOriginally i had a rather easy 4-6% of Passo Resia but ultimately decided on a much smaller but also way more difficult climb that's parallel to Resia. This climb heads to a village of Alsago/Aisack. The climb technically continues for another 1km to Piavenna/Plawenn, but it's a dead end. Below you can see the road to Alsago.\n\nClimb to Alsago.\n\nIt's not easy to talk about this climb as i couldn't find any profiles and the climb hugs a (covered in heavy foliege) steeper mountain slope so the Google Maps profile is probably scewed. Starting from Malles Venosta the climb is 4,8km at 9,1% or 9,2% (you may round it up to 5km at 9%). It seems the climb is split into two parts with a 1,5km to 1,8km of slightly easier climbing (~6%). The first harder part is roughly 1,5km at 10,3% while the second one is roughly 1,8km at 10,1%. Combining with the first 3,6km at 5,2% to Malles Venosta overally it's 9km at 7% (it's more of a guestimation though).\n\nProfile of Alsago w/o last roughly 1,1km.\n\nThe descent is only 2,7km at rather irregular 3,1% (last 500m at roughly 7%). It's mostly straight but on a tiny road. Once again it might be a case of a much harder side being easier to descend. Said descent leads to San Valentino Alla Muta – the first town of upper Venosta, right at the top of Passo Resia.\n\nDescent from Alsago.\n\nStarting from San Valentino Alla Muta the last 11,7km to the finish are flat. The finish is so far away because there you can find a nice, big, juicy parking lot of Lago di Resia / Reschensee. This lot is also part of the main ski station of upper Venosta – Belpiano / Schöneben. The exact finish line would be on the other side of the Resia lake (main body of water of Val Venosta) with quality views of the valley and nearby mountain peaks. However, you may try to seek a less capable finish place if you want a higher potential of smaller groups.\n\nThe ride in upper Venosta goes mostly around Lago di Resia/Reschensee through the towns of Curon Venosta/Graun im Vinschgau nad Resia/Reschen am See. The lake was created in 1950 and is mainly known for the partly submerged XV c. bell tower of the former church of Curon Venosta.\n\nLago di Resia/Reschensee.\n\nThere is an alternative finish possible. I think objectively it should be a better way but my choice was specifically to sort of commemorate the last Jafferau stage. Said alternatve is to finish in a small ski station Pramaggiore/Pramajur roughly halfway down Passo Resia. The station is located above the village of Burgusio/Burgeis and Malles/Mals. The climb starts from the first switchback above Malles. It's 7,3km at fairly regular 7,4%. The hardest seems to be 1km at 10% (max 12-14%) roughly in the middle. You can combine it with Alsago and then descent half of Resia to have back to back TdF cat. 1/Giro cat. 2 climbs. The road is quite wide (but a narrow part in the village) and in decent condition. At the top there is a small parking lot.\n\nProfile of Pramaggiore.\n\nOriginally the next stage was supposed to be somewhat different but because of the Svizzer N.P., Lecco being a complete nightmare to navigate and Como already being on Giro 2019 i've decided to have a somewhat less obvious choice for the next stage. It still should be a breakaway fare though.\n\nJust a breakaway stage to give the guys and the fans some fresh air after 3 consecutive (with a rest day though) high mountain days. Even if it's just a transitional stage, i struggled with the design. Originally there was Como, then Lecco and finally i've settled with a less natural choice.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/256001\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 17. Scuol-Tarasp / Scolio-Taraspo – Barzio. Piani di Bobbio, 174km, medium mountain, HTF.\n\nClimbs:\n\nArdez / Ardezzo – 4,1km, 5,1%, cat. 4, 1431m\n\nParlasco – 5,2km, 5,6%, cat. 3, 497m\n\nPiani di Bobbi – 3,2km, 5,9% (max 10%), cat. 3, 818m\n\nI've realised i have a lack of hilltop finishes and a lesser known ski resort in Altopiano Valsassinese (upper Valsassina) might be interesting. The resort is part of Pianni di Bobbio connected with Rifugio Trifoglio in Valtorta at the end of the Brembo valley (Passo San Marco, Foppolo, San Pellegrino Terme). This discovery was born in pain. Firstly there was Como with a cat. 4 climb of San Bartolomeo north of the city. After 2019 Giro decided to have a finish there i've changed to Lecco. I knew i would struggle with putting a finish in this rather chaotically put city. I had this stage for a while and only recently i've founded about Piani di Bobbio and that's sort of how this stage was put.\n\nPrevious iteration of this stage.\n\nProfile of Ofenpass.\n\nAs you can see above, the start was also different. Originally the peloton stayed overnight in Venosta and then reached Engandina via Passo Fuorno/Ofenpass. I decided to scrap it because Ofenpass is part of the Svizzer National Park and i have more than enough national parks on the route. An alternative would mean a short stint in Austria (Norbertshöhe), which i don't want to do. Thankfully lower Engadina is quite close to Venosta (roughly 40km away) so i decided for an overnight transfer through Austria to Scuol – the largest village in this part of the valley. I'm not sure if this village may have enough money to host a Giro stage so i also decided to incorporate nearby village of Tarasp for help.\n\nTarasp.\n\nEngadina derives from the Romansh (main language in east Switzerland) name of the Inn river. With Adige on the Italian side Inn is the main river of Tyrol. The lower Engadina is a nice looking deep valley between Silvretta Alps (highest peak – Piz Linard at 3410m) to the north and Alpi Retiche/Rätische Alpen (Svizzer Alps, highest peak – Piz Bernina at 4049m) to the south. I'm not sure if it was on the northern side of Silveretta (Vorarlberg), where the modern Alpine skiing was born. The valley is part of canton of Grisons (Grigioni/Graubünden). With Val Müstair to the south it creates the region Engiadina Bassa/Val Müstair (Unterengadin/Münstertal), formerly known as the Inn district. The valley is known for its large stone, often decorated housing – the so-called Engadinerhaus.\n\nUnterengadin/Bassa Engadina.\n\nOchsental Glacier in Silvretta.\n\nMorteratsch Glacier in the Bernina Group, Alpi Retiche/Rätische Alpen.\n\nScuol is the largest commune and administrative center of lower Engadina. It consists of Scuol proper (where the start is placed), Tarasp to the west and Sent (Sent im Unterengadin) to the east. Historically the main village is the youngest, dating back to XIV c. Both Tarasp and Sent were founded in XI-XII c. by a local Tarasp family that came here from either Como or Brixen/Bressanone. You may recognize the family from my previous stage as they in XII c. restored both Carolingian monasteries at Müster and Burgusio in Venosta. They bought the land from the bishops of Chur, who controlled the valley since the late antiquity. In 1464 the whole valley fell to the Habsburgs from Tyrol. The valley was the last region to join the Helvetic Republic (modern Switzerland) which happened in 1803.\n\nScuol.\n\nCastello Taraspo/Schloss Tarasp and Lago Taraspo/Taraspsee.\n\nThe oldest part of what's now the commune of Scuol is Tarasp. This village originates from the XI c. Tarasp castle on top of a local hill above a small lake Taraspsee. For roughly four centuries the valley belonged to the Tarasp family, later being inherited by the Habsburgs. Thanks to the existence of local mineral springs in the hamlet of Vulpera the region developed as a spa resort with the first spa hotels already existing before 1850. The prosperity however ended with WW1 and the region switched towards winter tourism. The main ski resort is Motta Naluns located in Scuol with roughly 80km of slopes on both sides of the valley.\n\nCastello Taraspo/Schloss Tarasp upclose.\n\nWorth noting are two other fractions of Scuol – S-charl and Sent. The former is a very remote village hidden at the end of a local S-charl sidevalley that extends south to the Svizzer N.P. The village is situated at almost 1800m and is connected with the Engadin by a fine quality dirt road. Above S-charl is Tamangur – the highest pine forest in Europe reaching as high as 2251m at Pass da Costainas – a local pass connecting Engadin with Val Muster. The village was founded in XIV c. after the discovery of lead and silver deposits. After they depleted in late XIX c. the village transformed into a mountain hiking center and an entrance to Svizzer N.P. In 1904 the last brown bear in Sitzerland was hunted down in the vincinity. Main sights are probably the remains of a miners home Schmelzra and a mining and Swiss bear museum. You may think of having here a stage finish of a minor race. Starting from Scuol the mostly false-flat ascent is 12,7km at roughly 5% with the first 3,8km to Plan San Jon (Plan Sankt Johannes?) at 8,5%. The last 5,6km at 4,2% are on dirt.\n\nS-charl.\n\nThe other mentioned fraction is Sent. It's located on a terrace north of the river Inn. The village was founded by the Tarasp family and is roughly as old as Scuol. Up to XIX c. it was mainly a farmland. The village is known for its late XVIII c. and early XIX c. Engadinerhaues situated on the main square known as... Platz (creativity at its finest). Since XIX c. the village is popular with artist and writers.\n\nSent.\n\nFinally to the stage itself. The first half mostly follows the 2009 stage 7. It went from Innsbruck to Chiavenna with a tricky descent from Maloja. It was won by EBH from a breakaway. It was either just before his prime or right at it. There are some minor changes to that stage like i'm moving the KOM from Maloja to Ardez that's much closer to the start to spark a good breakaway and i'm also doing an ascent to the very center of Sankt Moritz (intermediate sprint) rather than staying on the main road (route 27) below the town.\n\nProfile of Giro 2009 stage 7.\n\nIn the middle ages Ardez was a feudal flef of the Frickingen family. Possibly it also belonged to nearby Tarasp. The seat was in the Steinsberg castle of late XII c. From XII to XV c. it belonged to the bishops of Chur, who gave it to various local families. The castle was destroyed in 1499 during the Swabian War (or Helvetic War) between Switzerland and Habsburgs. Since then it was not restored. The village itself is home to a number of XVII-XIX c. Engadinerhauses with painted facades. Not far from the village are the remains of a medieval village of Gonda, which was deserted sometimes in XVII c. caused by avalanches and floodings of a local creek. Preserved are the foundations of a XII c. church and at least 9 other buildings.\n\nLower Engadin in Ardez with Steinsberg on top of a hill.\n\nRoughly 15km from Scuol is the village of Susch (Susio in Italian) where the Engandin enters its middle phase, which spans for the next 5-6km to Zernez. That's where the valley is at its tightest. In Susch the main road splits. I'm of course sticking with the main Engadin road as the other one leads to Davos via Flüelapass. Like many places in Engadin also Susch was destroyed in 1499 during the Swabian War but two XIII c. towers Praschun and Planta. Above the village is Fortezza Rohan – a citadelle built in XVII c. during the Thirty Years war.\n\nXII c. Planta tower and XVI c. Sankt Johanneskirk, Susch.\n\nZernez (Cernezzo in Italian) is one of the largest villages of Engadin with roughly 1500 inhabitants. It's located at the junction of the main Engadin road with the Ofenpass road that leads to Val Müstair. That's also where the stage joins its original design. In the village the Engadin widens up significantly creating Upper Engadin (Oberengadin). The village is home to Planta-Wildenberg castle originating from XII c. It belonged to the Sagogn-Wildenberg family, possibly on behalf of Tarasp. The castle was destroyed in XVII c. during the Thirty Years War and rebuilt after the war by a local nobility Johann von Planta.\n\nConjunction of lower and higher Engandin in Zernez.\n\nPlanta-Wildenberg castle, Zernez.\n\nAfter another period of wilderness the village of Zuoz emerges. Historically nearby Samedan and Sankt Moritz were super effective against it. Zuoz is considered to be the original capital of upper Engadin. The village dates back to X-XI c. Originally it was in possesion of the bishops of Chur, but in 1244 they gave the village and the power over upper Engadin to the Planta family, which resided there untill French expelled them in 1798 and incorporated the valley to the canton of Raetia (now Grisons). Throughout the history there were many local skirmishes between Zuoz and nearby Samedan. During the Reformation period the village was home to a Swiss humanist and governor Johann Travers, who authored the first written piece of the Rhaeto-Romance language. At the same time the main square was also used as an open-air theater, where the plays were in Rhaeto-Romance. The modern Zuoz is mainly an upper class ski resort with a renowned alpine skiing school.\n\nZuoz.\n\nNeighboring Zuoz is a certain La Punt. You should know this little village pretty well as it's the traditional finish to the Albula (which starts here) stages in Tour de Suisse. The next larger village is Samedan, where the race will exit the main Engadina route 27 for an uphill intermediate sprint in front of Sankt Moritz. That's the only change from the 2009 stage, which didn't leave the main route.\n\nLa Punt.\n\nXIII c. La Tuor in nearby Samedan. In the middle ages it was a residential tower belonging to the Planta family.\n\nLike La Punt, Samedan is also a major road junction – this time with Passo Bernina. Closer to Bernina are Pontresina and Diavolezza-Lagalb, which can be a potential stage finish. This ski hub, part of the southern slopes of nearby Sankt Mortiz is 5,8km from the top of Bernina. It has plenty of space available (quite similar to Station des Rousses) and can be used in conjunction with a next day start in Sankt Moritz. 1,2km before Diavolezza-Lagalb, 4,6km from Bernina is also a smaller parking space of Curtinatsch. You can combine it with Mendola/Palade – Tonale – Gavia – Bernina or Stelvio – Bernina. Other options with Trivigno/Mortirolo should also be available.\n\nProfile of Passo Bernina.\n\nThe descent from Bernina. Diavolezza-Lagalb is at around 6km mark.\n\nIf you want to have a finish further away from Bernina then you can try for either Samedan, Sankt Moritz or Pontresina, above Samedan. In the middle ages the village was a major stronghold over the Bernina road. From that time originates the XII c. Spaniola tower. This tower was probably also the seat of a local Pontresina family. I'm not sure but Pontresina may be a minor Biathlon site. I guess LS knows this way better than me.\n\nSpaniola tower, Pontresina.\n\nI don't think i will ever have an oppurtunity to mention this but Bernina was crucial during the 1954's Giro, being the hero of a \"Bernina strike\" story. The story itself is way too long for this post, including financing problems, Nivea sponsorships, Coppi's \"private\" life and stomach problems and \"fuga di bidone\" being better than expected. If you want to now more head in this direction.\n\nPasso Bernina and the Bernina rail – i think the highest open railway in Europe.\n\nThe interemediate sprint is at the very front of Sankt Moritz. Unlike in 2009 i decided to climb to the very center of the town. The climb starts in Samedan and it's 1,5km at 5,6%. The descent back to route 27 leads through the center of Sankt Moritz and it is quite tricky. The road is quite twisty and not that wide. The race joins back the route 27 in Silvaplana – a little village at the bottom of famous Julierpass/Passo del Giulio. This pass was one featured in Giro during a ridiculously designed stage (visually speaking, it wasn't that hard), which featured Umbrail, Livigno, Bernina via Forcola di Livigno, Julier and a finish on the much easier southern side of Lenzerheide. A rare example, where a decent chunk of a stage is above 1700m alt. The stage was won by Mariano Piccoli in front of Giuseppe Guerini with the main pack rolling 2:06 behind.\n\nProfile of the Lenzerheide stage.\n\nSilvaplana, Lago di Silvaplana and Julierpass in the background.\n\nThe last 11km of the Engadin goes around the Silvaplana and Sils lakes. In between both of them is i think the 2nd bigges ski resort of the valley – Sils or Segl. The village was also a summer residence of Frederick Nietzsche between 1881 and 1888. Of course the valley ends with Passo Maloja and is followed by a very long descent towards Chiavenna – the same that in 2009 (if my memory is correct) was feared by some of the guys. Above Maloja is Passo del Settimo – a historic pass at 2310m dating back to the Roman Empire and linking Maloja with Bivio on the other side of Julierpass. It stayed as a stone surface hiking path. It was a very important pass as even the first German king to be titled Emperor Otto I crossed the pass in 961 to be later coronated by the Pope as the Holy-Roman Emperor.\n\nProfile of the descent from Passo Maloja.\n\nSils and its namesake lake in the background.\n\nThe descent is very long. The toughest parts are the first 2,5km with 15 harpins and another 2,5km with 7 harpins 5km further down. Both sections are at 8-9%. The rest however is mostly straight. Becasue it's a major road it's wide and in very good state. Unlike the last time, this time the guys don't need to fear anything as the descent is in the middle of the stage rather than at its end. However, if you're braver and in the breakaway then you will be rewarded with the 2nd intermediate sprint in Chiavenna, where the descent ends. The race will cross the Suisse-Italy border around 20km from Maloja.\n\nUpper hairpins of Malojapass.\n\nThe entire descent is in the upper Mera valley, known as Val Bregaglia/Bergelltal. The valley is surrounded by the Bregaglia range. Highest peak is Monte Disgrazia at 3678m. Geographically it's quite interesting as it's the only mountain range in Europe, where 3 major river basins have their sources – North Sea with Avers Rhine, Black Sea with Inn (later joins Danube) and Adriatic Sea with Mera (later joins Po). The descent is accompanied by a number of villages like Casaccia, Bondo, Stampa etc.\n\nCasaccia and Val Bregaglia.\n\nMonte Disgrazia (3678m).\n\nPiz Badile (3308m).\n\nToday i tried to focus more on Engadin as it's a rather overlooked region. No wonder as you have Fluela, Julier, Albula etc. in near vincinity. Because of this post's length the rest in Lombardia will be more rapid. Chiavenna is located in a place, where the Roman road to Chur (then Cuira) splitted. One road went via Passo Spluga, the other one via aforementioned Passo del Settimo above Maloja. The city is at the end of Val Bregaglia, where the valley widens up significantly (Valchiavenna) to end at Lake Como not far to the south.\n\nValchiavenna.\n\nCascate dell'Acquafraggia near Chiavenna.\n\nNext 40km are in Valchiavenna and partly alongside Lake Como. The race leaves the lake in Bellano, but to do that i need to cross some rail tracks (they may lead to Tirano and via Bernina to Engadina) and sadly they're unavoideable. After a cat. 3 climb that tops near the village of Parlasco the stage will enter Valsassina – a valley of river Pioverna located above Lecco. You may remember it from Pian dei Resinelli. It's created by the Grigna massif (2410m) renown for Pian dei Resinelli and Alpi Orobie (Piani di Bobbio). From south the valley can be reached from Lecco via Balisio or like in 2012 via a quite narrow Culmine di San Pietro from Val Brembana. Below you can see the valley's profile starting from Bellano to the Barzio sign 2km from Balisio.\n\nProfile of the last 25km w/o the last climb to Barzio.\n\nValsassina.\n\nThe finish is tied to the ski area of Piani di Bobbio. It's the 2nd largest station of Valsassina after Pian dei Resinelli. It's shared with Valtorta at the end of Val Brembana. The Valsassina side belongs to the village of Barzio, which is 1-2km below the station. The climb to the station is 3,2km at 5,9%. The climb is fairly regular but you can distinct two tougher parts separated by a slightly easier one roughly in the middle. The first tougher section is 1,4km at roughly 8% (max 10%). It's followed by an easier 700m at 2-3%% in Barzio. The last 750m to the station are at roughly 7,3% with the first 300m nearing 10%.\n\nBarzio.\n\nGrigna massif.\n\nI think the only possible outcome is a large breakaway finishing way before the main group, which should be a little smaller than usually because of that cat. 3 (strong TdF cat. 3) finish. I don't expect anything of GC relevance to happen but there are still some stages left for that. Next stage will start west of Milan and head towards Piemonte.\n\nThe last flat stage of this race and a transition to the last mountain block of the race. It won't include anything of Piemonte Alps as Montoso/Rucas will be in the next Giro, but as a pass and not an MTF, which was my original plan.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/250101\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 18. Abbiategrasso – Racconigi, 177km, flat.\n\nClimbs:\n\nMoncalvo – 1,5km, 5,3%, cat. 4, 258m\n\nToday it's Lombardia and Piemonte, mostly inside the vast Po plains. There are however some bumps within the hilly regions of Monferrato (north of Asti) and Roero (north of Bra) that includes a dummy cat. 4 for the breakaway. The sprint outcome should be expected, especially as this will be the last chance for a bunch sprint finish. Both regions with nearby Langhe (south of Bra) are renown for their wines and are part of the UNESCO WHS. There might be some wind or bad weather threat (mainly hailstorms) as the general area of the Po plains likes to be stormy at this part of the year.\n\nLombardia is a rather vast but to my eyes artificial area covering the west side of the Po plains. For some reason at one place it extends almost to Ferrara. Its history is very similar to that of Emilia Romagna – a rather late but rapid development in the Roman Empire followed by a general destruction during the Germanic invasions. The region recovered during the Bysantine and Longobards (V-VIII c.) with many of smaller towns originating during that period.\n\nAfter Charlemagne conquered northern Italy in 774 the region stayed within the borders of the Holy-Roman Empire and its next iterations. Like in the other regions of the Empire, this one also suffered from fragmentations to basically a polis-like states ruled by various families like Visconti, Borgha, Gonzaga, Sforza etc. that didn't particullary liked each other or themselves in that matter. The towns however were prosperous enough to the point of creating a Lombard League – sort of a separatist movement designed against the Hohenstaufen Holy-Roman Emperors, who wanted a larger political influence over Italy. This league was disbanded in 1250 after the last Hohenstaufen Frederick II died.\n\nLater Lombardia was the center of the Italian Reinassance with Milan and Mantova at times bloodily competing with one another. The prosperity ended with the Thirty Years War after which Lombardy belonged to Austria and later the Napoleonic Empire. The region was finally annexed to then fresh Kingdom of Italy in 1859 after a short-lived war between Italy and Austria. The modern Lombardia is the richest regon of Italy, mainly thanks to a rapid industrialization of the region.\n\nAbbiategrasso.\n\nAbbiategrasso is a rather inconspicuous town over Ticino that flows west of Milan. It dates back to XI-XII c. From this time dates the Castello Visconteo – a residential/military manor house of Visconti and later Sforzas. Other sights include a XVI c. manor house Casa Albini and XIV c. Basilica di Santa Maria Nuova. The town is the birthplace of a well known AC Milan goalie Christian Abbiati. It's worth noting that the stage was created independently to the last Giro, when stage 18 to Prato Nevoso started in the town.\n\nCastello Visconteo, Abbiategrasso.\n\nSoon after leaving Abbiategrasso the race crosses Ticino and enters the region of Lomellina and its capital and a sort of twin town to Abbiategrasso – Vigevano. It's history is almost similar to the one of Abbiategrasso. It's an older town founded in X c. by late Longobards as a hunting lodge. In 1328 it was annexed by Milan and expanded into a major Milanese town by Visconti and Sforzas (who took the town by force in 1449). In 1452 Lodovico Sforza was born in the town and 4 years later he expanded the pre-existing lodge into a Reinassance residence (now housing a shoe museum) and commisioned an attached to it Piazza Ducale – the main attraction of the city.\n\nPiazza Ducale, Vigevano.\n\nRoughly 15km from Vigevano, right in the very middle of Lomellina is Mortara. It's one of the oldest towns of Lomellina, second after Roman Lomellum – now Laumellum roughly 10km south of Mortara. The town developed during the Longobard rule. At the time it was known as Pulchra Silva, but the name was changed after a nearby battle between Charlemagne and Longobard King Desiderius in 773, which the former won. In the middle ages it was a hunting lodge of Visconti and Sforza combined with a border stronghold near the border with Piemonte. After Milan fell to Savoy in 1713 it became the capital of Lomellina (to 1859, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy). Nowadays Mortara is a major rice production center. Main sights are XIV c. Basilica di San Lorenzo and Abbazia di Sant'Albino, that according to a legend was founded by Charlemagne after the aforementioned battle.\n\nAbbazia di Sant'Albino, Mortara.\n\nWhen the stage crosses the Sesia roughly 40km from the start it leaves Lombardia (more exactly Pavia province) and enters Piemonte (Alessandria province). Piemonte will welcome the peloton with an intermediate sprint in the village of Oltreponte near Casale Monferrato. In said village the race crosses Po and Casale Monferrato and later enters the hills of Monferrato (Alto Monferrato) and province of Asti.\n\nMonferrato near San Marzano Oliveto with Monviso in the background.\n\nAlto Monferrato is a hilly region roughly at the end of the Po plains separated from the Alps by Po itself and from the foothills of Ligurian Alps and Appennines by Tanaro. Highest hill is Albugnano at 520m. With the hills of Roero to the west and Langhe to the south it's part of the UNESCO WHS thanks to its vineyards. It's one of the main wine regions of Italy.\n\nLandscape of Monferrato near Costigliole d'Asti.\n\nThe race enters Monferrato in Casale Monferrato. Historically Monferrato belonged to Mantova. However, because of the approximity to Torino and Milano, which weren't in good terms with Mantova the region was heavily fortified and Casale was the frontier of Monferrato and for a while also its capital. It was razed after the battle of Bassignano of 1745 between Sardinian-Piemontese and French-Spanish armies as part of the War of the Austrian Succession. In XIX c. it became a major cement and later asbestos hub, which caused huge health problem in the region. Main sights are XII c. Duomo di Sant'Evasio built on top of a previous Longobard church from IX c. XV c. Chiesa di San Domenico and XIV c. former citadelle Castello dei Paleologi. The town is also a production center of Barbera del Monferrato wine. Nearby Casale is San Giorgio Monferrato – a hilltop village topped by a massive castle. It dates back to X c. and it was a seat of various families, mainly from Mantova.\n\nCastello dei Paleologi, Casale Monferrato.\n\nSan Giorgio Monferrato.\n\nIn Serralunga di Crea (just west of Casale) the race will enter SP457, which is part of a route that extends from Domodossola (Simplon) to Nice via Tenda tunnel. From here the stage will go through Alto Monferrato to Asti. Serralunga di Crea is a hilltop village that's home to Sacro Monte di Crea – one of the Lombardian sacred mountains, also part of the UNESCO WHS. According to a legend it was founded in IV c. alongside Oropa by a bishop of Vercelli Sant'Eusebio. The first sanctuary however dates back to XI-XII c. It was rebuilt in 1589 by the Gonzagas.\n\nSantuario di Crea.\n\nOutside of Serralunga starts the only categorised clmb of the day. It leads to a hilltop village of Moncalvo. Said climb is 1,5km at 5,3%. This commune of Roman origins is considered to be the first historic capital of Monferrato. However, not much of its antique history had survived. The modern Moncalvo dates to XIII c. It's home to XV c. Palazzo Manacorda, Casa Lanfrancone with some parts dating back to XIII c. and XIII c. Chiesa di San Francesco. The Moncalvo climb is followed by a smaller climb towards another hilltop village of Calliano, home to a XI c. Chiesa di San Pietro and X c. Chiesa di San Michele. Before reaching Asti there will be a rail crossing but the tracks don't seem to be used anymore.\n\nMoncalvo.\n\nCalliano.\n\nWith Torino, Novara, Alba and Alessandra Asti it's the largest town of the Po plains west of Milano. It dates back to the Roman Empire, when it was known as Hasta. After a Visigothic siege of Milano in 402 the West Roman Emperor Honorius had to flee to Arles, but was cut short in Asti. The city managed to resist the Visihothic siege and was freed after a won by Romans battle in Pollenzo (Pollentia) near Bra. There are still some antique remains in the city of which the most interesting must be a I c. Torre Rossa. It was probably part of a palace, later used as a prison and as a bell tower to attached to it XI c. Chiesa di Santa Caterina (rebult in XVIII c.).\n\nTorre Rossa, Asti.\n\nThat's not the only ancient tower in Asti as it was home to over 100 of them. That was in the middle ages, when Asti was a large and rich prince-bishopric with a farfetched autonomy from the Holy-Roman Empire. It was also one of the strongest members of the Lombard League. The prosperity mainly came from controling a number of routes towards the Ligurian ports and French-Italian Alpine passes. Starting from XIV c. like any other Piemontese cities it was besieged countless amount of times, contantly changing hands between various Italian families, Savoie and France. However, it is relatively well preserved with a quite large medieval historic center around a XIII c. cathedral, originally from V c. The only surviving piece of the orginal cathedral may be a VII c. Cripta di Sant'Anastasio. One of the battles against the neighboring city of Alba is commemorated to this day as a Palio di Asti event.\n\nDuomo di Asti.\n\nAsti has a number of medieval towers and palazzos that survived like Palazzo Catena and Palazzo Zoya, both with parts from XIII c. or XIII c. former town hall Palazzo del Podestà. In the middle ages Ati was renowned for banker families, which were living in at the time lavish civic towers. There were roughly 100 of them, but only a couple of them survived to this day like XIII c. Torre Comentina, XIII c. Torre de Regibus, XIII-XIV c. Torre Solaro or XII c. Torre Troyana, since XVII c. a bell tower housing one of the oldest bells in Piemonte. Asti was home to a XVIII c. dramatist Vittorio Alfieri who's considered to be the “founder of Italian tragedy\". It is also home to a number of Monferrato wines like Moscato or Barbera d'Asti.\n\nPalazzo del Podestà, Asti.\n\nTorre Troyana, Asti.\n\nFrom Asti the race heads towards its neighbor and historic rival Alba, but not through the Tanaro valley but deeper inside Monferrato and later Roero in parallel to Tanaro Borbore valley. The main village of the valley is San Damiano d'Asti. This village is in the middle of a local hilly range of Colli Alfieri. The village dates back to antiquity, when it was known as Astixio. In XIII c. it found itself right in the middle of a bloody rivalry between Asti and Alba. It led to the full destruction of the village. The new San Damiano d'Asti was founded in 1275 as a fortified village on a geometric layout similar to that of a Roman camp. While both village gates were later repurposed the ramparts stayed intact to this day.\n\nSan Damiano d'Asti.\n\nOverlooking San Damiano d'Asti is a hilltop village of Govone, home to an early medieval castle, which was damaged during the XIII c. battles between Asti and Alba. The castle was rebuilt into a Savoian royal palace, which means it's the first Savoian royal palace seen during the stage. In 1730 French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau stayed in here. I think the palace is now part of the UNESCO WHS under the royal palaces of Savoy listing.\n\nGovone.\n\nPalazzo di Govone.\n\nThe valley ends in the former village and since 2011 town (roughly 5000 pop.) of Canale, where the stage enters the hillside vineyards of Roero. Landscape-wise it's basically a copy of Monferrato. You can even see them on the profile as the 2nd set of bumps that ends in the city of Bra. However, none of them are difficult enough to be categorised but you can find many local roads going up and down to local hilltop villages so it should be a nice playground for you. Canale itself was founded alongside San Damiano d'Asti by Asti. Now its mainly renown as a production site of Roero Arnesis white wine. The town is overlooked by a picturesque hilltop village of Cisterna d'Asti, home to a XII c. castle enclosed by massive ramparts.\n\nCanale and hills of Roero in the background.\n\nCisterna d'Asti.\n\nFrom Canale i'm dodging Alba with slightly smaller roads like SP29, SP10 and SP134 that will lead to Bra via Corneliano, Baldissero and Pocapaglia. These roads are used in a local bike race Gran Premio di Pasquetta. In the middle ages the region belonged to Alba, but it was close to the border with Asti which meant the villages were fortified. For example Corneliano was home to a military castle, which now is in ruins. A similar castle can be found in nearby Baldissero d'Alba. This hilly voyage through Roero ends in the city of Bra, where the race will enter the very end of the Po plains that extends from Turin to Cuneo.\n\nCorneliano d'Alba.\n\nCastello Colonna, Baldissero d'Alba.\n\nBra and nearby Pollenzo are gates to what i consider the main Piemonte. I differenciate it from Roero and Monferrato as most of their history was associated with Lombardia and their city-states (Asti, Alba and such) while the rest of the region was under a long standing rule of Savoie. Even the capital of Savoie was moved from Chambéry to Torino (1563) as it was deemed the Italian city-states were an easier threat than France. In 1720 Savoie expanded to Sardinia, creating the Kingdom of Sardinia and Savoy. During the Napoleonic rule it was known as Subalpine Republic. Piemonte was one of the originators of modern Italy and it was Savoian Vittorio Emanuele II, who became the first king of Italy in 1861. Savoie left a number of XVII-XVIII c. royal palaces that are now part of the UNESCO WSH.\n\nParts of the Pollenzo palace with Chiesa di San Vittore.\n\nAn example such palace can be found in Pollenzo which is situated over Tanaro just below Bra. The village dates back to the Roman Empire, where it was known as Pollentia. It's famous for the aforementioned 402 battle with Visigoths, when they were driven off from Italy. In the antquity the village was known for its wool and pottery. The modern Pollenzo was founded around XII-XIII c. with a manor house that belonged to local noble family of Romagnano. However, the whole village was built from scratch when in early XIX c. king of Sardinia and Savoy Charles Albert commisioned a royal palace to be built there.\n\nNowadays Pollenzo belongs to the hilltop city of Bra. I guess the name share with a certain lingerie piece is coincidental. Historically it was the other way around as it was Bra that was part of Pollenzo. Even if it was a small town allready in XIII-XIV c. it was significantly expanded in 1760 by Savoian king Charles Emmanuel III with a number of manor houses rebuilt like originally XV c. Palazzo Traversa or XIV c. Palazzo Mathis. The Giro finished here once in 1994 during the 19th stage won by Massimo Ghirotto and it was also the partenza to the famous '99 Borgo San Dolmazzo stage.\n\nPalazzo Traversa, Bra.\n\nFrom Bra the stage continues creeping closer to the Alps. The scare however will end not far from Bra, in the city of Savigliano, which i guess it's not too obscure for you as plenty of Piemonte stages started here. Maybe it's a bit overshadowed by Cuneo and Pinerolo. The town is located in the very middle of the Piemonte plains, roughly in the middle between Cuneo and Pinerolo. For a long time Savigliano was a village under the county of Saluzzo. It flourished in XVI-XVIII c. as a major French-Savoian stronghold. Main sights are XIV c. Chiesa di Santa Maria della Pieve which may have some parts dating back to V-VII c. Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista with parts from XI c. and XIII c. Torre Civica.\n\nSavigliano.\n\nThe run-in to Racconigi will be exclusively on the main Cuneo - Torino route SP20. Before reaching Racconigi peloton will also pass through the town of Cavallermaggiore, mainly known as a residence of Ascanio Sobrero, who was the inventor of nitroglycerine. It's worth noting that the last 5km from Cavallermaggiore to the finish line in Racconigi are almost entirely straight besides a roundabout 3km from the finish and a slight right-hander 1,2km from the finish. The finish line is on Corso Principi di Piemonte right in front of the Racconigi's palace entrance. This exact finish was one of the options during my last Giro in 2016, when i decided to replace it with a tougher stage to Fossano. Maybe something like that stage should also be here as i'm sort of lacking in hilly stages. I feel the 1st week had enough such stages and this will be the last and oppurtunity for the sprinters so i decided to give them the easiest finish possible.\n\nRacconigi's palace.\n\nThe first signs of Racconigi date back to late X c. where a small manor house was already mentioned. Later said manor house developed into a palace that you can see right now. The village itself was founded in XII c. by the counts of Saluzzo. The village was bought by the duke of Savoie Charles Emmanuel I in 1630 and he granted the estate to his nephew Thomas Francis. The newly commisioned palace was drawn by an Italian architect Guarino Guarini. Later the estate was repurposed as a summer residence of the kings of Italy. The last king of Italy Umberto II was born here. Its vast park is now a protected area, home to various birds like white storks or white-headed ducks. Racconigi was twice hosting a Giro stage. First time stage 14 of 1997 to Breuil-Cervinia (the Gotti scheme) and second time stage 15 of 1999 to Oropa. Both stages are quite famous for Gotti winning the Giro by a \"smoke screen\" and Pantani for being at his most ridiculous.\n\nFront of the palace.\n\nThe last 3 stages will be GC relevant so hold on tight.\n\nI'd always wanted to find a way to crowbar Rodengo and Kieneralm together in to a stage... you know the problem though because you mentioned it ahead of time: pas de Fedaia... however your stage to Reschenpass does rather let me on to some new thoughts for this series... a couple more of these and then I'll be set onto the next ordinary stage race project. I have far more Nordic Series options than I know what to do with, but since the switch of googlemaps to OSM in the cronoescalada builder, there's a problem that when I'm most thinking about wintersport, some of the roads are shut and the open road overrider isn't operational anymore.\n\nNordic Series #21: Le Brassus\n\nA small resort town in the Swiss Jura, Le Brassus is located in the Vallée de Joux, well known to the Tour de Romandie and also occasionally the Tour de Suisse. It is adjacent to Le Chenit, and this area was last seen in the local race through Francophone Switzerland in 2015, when the Vallée de Joux hosted the race-opening TTT which was won by Team Sky. The Langlaufpisten are in the open areas behind Le Brassus to the north, around the Audemars Piguet hotel and resort.\n\nThe cross-country trails here have been done up recently with the victorious bid of Lausanne for the 2020 Youth Olympics; while the biathlon is, as has been mentioned in a previous post, being held across the border in France, at the Prémanon-Les Tuffes facility, the Cross-Country is to be held here at Le Brassus. The course has prepared itself with a couple of races at the Alpencup and Continental Cup level, where it was inaugurated earlier this month. Being aimed at ages 12-18, previous Youth Olympic champions have in many cases still yet to reach their peak years, since the Winter events only began in 2012 (the European Youth Olympic Festival is much older of course, but the Youth Olympic Games were inaugurated with the aim of being more international than that, although all hosts of the Winter version thus far have been European). Names you may have heard of who have come to success in the Nordic sports following Youth Olympic achievement include Anastasiya Sedova, gold in the 5km classic in Innsbruck 2012; Jonna Sundling, silver in the sprint at the same event; Anamarija Lampič, silver behind Sedova and now silver medallist in the Team Sprint in the same venue (Seefeld hosted the XC at the Innsbruck Youth Olympics) this year; the biathlon events in Innsbruck were dominated among the girls' events by three now staple international competitors, Franziska Preuß of Germany (a World Cup race winner and multiple World Champion in the relay, as well as a World Championships medallist and crystal globe winner in the Mass Start discipline back in 2015), Uliana Kaisheva of Russia (one of only four Russian biathletes to be cleared to compete in Pyeongchang) and Galina Vishnevskaya, multiple Junior World medallist of Kazakhstan who was recently also cleared to return to competition. René Zahkna, who won silver in both the boys' sprint and pursuit, has gone on to be a staple World Cup competitor but without further success, hampered in part by Estonia's lack of funding compared to the big guns. There was also a somewhat bizarre biathlon/XC mixed relay where Preuß was teamed up with Victoria Carl, who is now Germany's top XC skier following Denise Herrmann's defection to biathlon, and France's biathlon"
