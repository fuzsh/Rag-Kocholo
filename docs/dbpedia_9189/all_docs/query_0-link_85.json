        "text": "The exhibition focuses on Margherita of Savoy (Turin 1851 - Bordighera 1926), who was the first queen of united Italy. Since her wedding with Prince Umberto, she was able to conquer the hearts of the Italians and, with her popularity, she contributed to building the feeling of identity of the nation around the crown of the Savoy.\n\nThe largest restoration project for a public asset in the heart of the city will restore theJuvarra façade to its former splendour, thanks to the synergy between two institutions: Fondazione Torino Musei, which has always been committed to the protection, conservation and enhancement of museum heritage, and Fondazione CRT, Palazzo Madama’s historic and main private supporter\n\nOn the occasion of the Comitato interministeriale per gli Affari Esteri celebrated in Turin on May 19 and 20, 2022, the City of Turin, the Piedmont Region, and Palazzo Madama with the Fondazione Torino Musei promoted the project Europa. L’illustrazione italiana racconta l’Europa dei popoli, with the financial support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of International Cooperation as well as the Ministry of Culture. Sixteen original illustrations made by an equal number of Italian illustrators were dedicated to the values promoted by the European Council and placed on two-sided banners that gave life to two solemn locations in Turin: the porticoes of Piazza San Carlo and of Via Po.\n\nAt the end of the semester of the Italian Presidency of the Council of Europe, the Interministerial Committee for Foreign Affairs is celebrated in Turin on 19 and 20 May 2022: on 19 May in the Sala delle Feste the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 46 Member States of the Council of Europe.

The Medieval Court becomes the seat of the Media Centre; the Juvarriana Veranda and the Medieval Garden offer moments of encounter with Piedmontese gastronomy.\n\nThe exhibition, curated by the Pompeii Archaeological Park and Palazzo Madama, invites you to enter the houses of Pompeii, to discover their atmospheres and furnishings. A dive into the past, which offers the opportunity to wander around those environments where the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. suddenly extinguished the life of its inhabitants: an invitation to recover the Roman roots of ancient Augusta Taurinorum and to imagine the life of its first decades of life.\n\nFor the entire month of March 2022, two classes of the Istituto Comprensivo Gaetano Salvemini use Palazzo Madama as educational environment: the classroom moves to the museum, where the teachers are called to make use of the collections and environments to consolidate skills and activate new learning paths. The project is a first experiment that intends to expand to the territory of the entire city.\n\nThanks to ten years of research work to which various Italian and foreign scholars have contributed, an important exhibition from 7 October 2021 to 9 January 2022, curated by Simone Baiocco and Vittorio Natale, which recomposes the figure of Antoine de Lonhy, a versatile artist from Burgundian origin, and illustrates its extraordinary impact for the renewal of the figurative panorama of the territory of present-day Piedmont in the second half of the fifteenth century.\n\nOn 4 July 2019, the Fondazione Torino Musei purchased the porcelain tea and chocolate service called \"Servizio del Re di Sardegna\" at Christie's auction house in London. The service, painted by Johann Gregorius Höroldt, is among the most important made by the Meissen manufacture: in 1725 it was personally donated by the sovereign Augustus the Strong to Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy, king of Sardinia.\n\nHe taught art history first at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Palermo and then at the Accademia Albertina in Turin, where he was director for two terms from 2005 to 2011, contributing to the relaunch of this historic institution and the annexed Pinacoteca d' Ancient art. From 1 April 2016 to 31 August 2019 he was director of Palazzo Madama – Civic Museum of Ancient Art.\n\nSince 1 September 2014, Palazzo Madama and the Medicina a Misura di Donna Onlus Foundation have been giving a cultural welcome to the approximately 8,000 children born every year at Sant'Anna in Turin, the largest gynecological and obstetric hospital in Europe. Nati con la Cultura allows children and their adult companions to enter the museum for free in the first year of life, from Palazzo Madama the project expands over the years to other Piedmontese and Italian museums.\n\nOn the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Civic Museum of Turin, the Turin Museums Foundation, thanks to the contribution of more than 1500 donors and through the first crowdfunding campaign organized by a museum institution in Italy, has purchased in London at the house of Bonhams auctions a prestigious tea, coffee and chocolate service in Meissen porcelain, which formerly belonged to the d'Azeglio family.\n\nPalazzo Madama celebrates the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy with the reconstruction of the Great Hall of the Senate which, starting from 1848, hosted the Subalpine Senate on the noble floor of Palazzo Madama and then, between 1861 and 1864, the first Senate of the Kingdom of Italy. The project was carried out thanks to the significant contribution of the CRT Foundation and the Italia 150 Committee, in collaboration with the Teatro Regio of Turin and is included in the Italia 150 Experience programme.\n\nExhibition, from 23 November to 23 January. The exhibition takes the visitor through the production of bijoux made in the United States between the 1930s and 1970s, with some specimens also from recent years. About 300 specimens from the collection of Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo are on display. Read the exhibition factsheet\n\nAfter that of the Borgo Medievale, built in 1998, the moat that runs all around the Palazzo Madama factory is also preparing to welcome what will be a new green area in the center. From spring 2011 Piazza Castello will be enriched with trees, meadows, medieval plants and fruit trees.\n\nTwelve years after the 1997-98 intervention, a new consolidation of the stone surfaces and plaster was carried out, thanks to the contribution of the Piedmont Region. At the same time, citizens are invited to follow the works and to communicate with the Museum via the Internet, but also by leaving messages directly on the roofing panels of the construction site.\n\nExhibition, from 23 March to 22 August. Arranged thanks to loans from private collectors, which make pieces otherwise precluded from viewing exceptionally available to the public, it offers over 100 ceramic sculptures, flanked by numerous preparatory plaster casts, drawings and sketches that allow the public to appreciate the artistic quality of Lenci's production and grasp the different production phases, from the creative one of the artists to the industrial realization. Edited by Valerio Terraroli and Enrica Pagella.\n\nExhibition, from 1 December to 14 February. On display are three important eighteenth-century porcelain tableware, from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, made by the most famous European manufacturers, Berlin, Sèvres and Wedgwood, on commission or to be donated to the Tsars. The protagonist of the exhibition is Catherine the Great, a German princess who married Tsar Peter III and established direct relationships with the great protagonists of the European Enlightenment.\n\nThe initiative promotes and explores the phenomenon of collecting, analyzing its mechanisms and objectives in order to better understand the collections of the past and to find their vital meaning in today's society, creating a new network of contacts between the historic collections of the Museum and the world of the present. From 16 December to 1 March the winning collections will remain on display at Palazzo Madama.\n\nExhibition, from 7 April to 5 July. Curated by Clelia Arnaldi di Balme and Franca Varallo, the exhibition arises from an in-depth study of the collections of Palazzo Madama, in particular of the graphic funds and collections of textiles, among which the works relating to the court celebrations have been identified in Piedmont from the mid-sixteenth century to the early eighteenth century. A path of objects from Italian and foreign museums, libraries and archives has been built around this nucleus.\n\nAs part of the Museum as Places for Intercultural Dialogue (Map for ID) program, the project involves, with activities in the classroom and activities in the Museum, 50 people from CTP Drovetti aged 16 to 60 and coming from Albania, Brazil, Cameroon, Cuba , Italy, Morocco, Moldova, Peru, the People's Republic of China, Romania and the Ukraine.\n\nThe visit to Palazzo Madama is enriched with the permanent display of the collection of architectural terracottas, the richest and most important in Piedmont in terms of variety and number of pieces, now housed in the hall of the Roman wall with a selection of 40 objects documenting the development centuries of decorative motifs and executive techniques.\n\nExhibition, from 29 July to 28 September - Fifty works of various types (plates, cake stands, vases, jugs, boxes, bolsters, nativity scenes, medal cabinets, chalices, monstrances, lamps) and origins (patrician residences, cathedrals, private chapels), datable between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, characterized by a sophisticated decoration that associates gold with coral encrustations. The exhibition project is by Clelia Arnaldi di Balme and Simonetta Castronovo, respectively curators of the Museum's collections of Baroque art and decorative arts, developing a proposal from the Europiemonte Association.\n\nExhibition, from 8 April to 6 July. Inserted in the Turin World Design Capital program, and curated by Enrico Morteo, the exhibition aims to give a sense of the path taken by the artist, for whom drawing, painting, graphics and design are all part of a single creative and interpretative process . In the dimension of his projects, the ancient and the modern, the Renaissance and the Bauhaus combine and become materials with which to build a new reality.\n\nThe intervention makes it possible to enhance the important polychrome wooden sculpture, referring to an unknown master active in southern Germany between the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the following century. Before its entry into the Museum, the work had belonged to the collection of the Marquis Emanuele Tapparelli d'Azeglio.\n\nTribute to Piedmont, to the places and men who in different ways and in successive eras crossed their destinies with the Civic Museum of Ancient Art. Each month is dedicated to the knowledge and enhancement of the cultural heritage of a different province with special themed itineraries and special admission for citizens coming from the province of the month.\n\nThe occasion of the stay in Turin is \"The U.N. Torino Retreat 2007\", a sort of strategic retreat that brings together the representatives of the most important world programs (Unicef, Ilo, Unesco ...) with the aim of analyzing and planning future strategies of UN Secretariat.\n\nExhibition, from 27 February to 27 May. Dedicated to the meeting of the Hellenistic civilization with the Mesopotamian, Iranian and Indian subcontinent civilizations, the exhibition, housed in the Palazzo Madama venue, presents itself as an opportunity to introduce mostly unpublished materials from Seleucia (terracotta, ceramics , coins, metal or glass objects), from the Museum collections, works of art and handicraft from the Seleuco-Parthian East, coming from major international museums and the schist reliefs found in the Gandhara region and preserved in the Mao.\n\nWith the reopening of Palazzo Madama, the museum is facing a new reality, with new challenges. New research is being opened to deepen the knowledge of the works present in the Museum, in particular the decorative arts; work is being done to build a working network with other city institutions, such as the University and other Italian and foreign museums. The work of the Educational Services is intensified and services to the public are strengthened. A new season of exhibitions and activities opens. In short, the Museum aims to return to being the beating heart of city life, both cultural and civil.\n\nOver the years, the museum continues to increase its heritage, with targeted purchases of objects closely linked to the collections, the territory and the decorative arts; important donations then contribute to keeping the heritage alive even in times of crisis, when it is difficult to acquire works on the market.\n\nCritics refer the work to the Neapolitan painter, a pupil of Ribera. The high pictorial quality of this canvas, also testified by the existence of various contemporary replicas, is hardly found in the other known works by him. A balanced conjunction of classicism and naturalism is revealed here.\n\nFrom 10 to 26 February, the City assigns the premises on the ground floor and first floor of the Palace to the Olympic Committee for the construction of its official headquarters. This choice represents the occasion for a new public presentation, during the Christmas period, of the architectural appearance of the monument not yet affected by the Museum's displays and collections.\n\nExhibition, from 7 February to 14 May. An itinerary to discover the figurative culture in the lands of the ancient Duchy of Savoy: the patrons, the artists, the plots of daily life, the paths of devotion. Paintings on wood, illuminated manuscripts, embroideries, jewelery and carvings tell the evolution of forms from the International Gothic to the dawn of the Renaissance along the passageways between Italy and France.\n\nThe intervention focuses on the stabilization of the wooden support, a poplar tablet a few millimeters thick, and on the legibility of the work, made difficult by the chromatic alteration and oxidation of the layers of varnish that covered the Portrait. On 7 June 2007 a conference dedicated to the restoration of the painting was held at the Reggia di Venaria.\n\nExhibition, from 21 September to 1 January. The exhibition, in the rooms of the Galleria Sabauda, is dedicated to the painter Jan Kraeck, Italianized in Giovanni Caracca, active in the service of Emanuele Filiberto and Carlo Emanuele I. A section of the exhibition is dedicated to the image of the court entrusted to miniatures and precious objects. Among these are two cameos with the portraits of Margherita di Valois and Carlo Emanuele I, purchased by the Civic Museum of Turin upon the sale of the assets of Maria Beatrice of Savoy, and a rare slate slab with the portrait of the duke within the cross of the Saints Maurice and Lazarus, from the same museum.\n\nAlberto Bruni Tedeschi, entrepreneur, collector and composer, was a member of the management committee of the Civic Museum of Ancient Art from 1954 to 1965, to which he donated some works. The most substantial contribution comes after his death, when in 2005 the family decides to donate to the Museum the collection of 150 miniatures from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, collected by Alberto during his lifetime and now exhibited on the first floor of Palazzo Madama.\n\nExhibition, from 14 September to 14 November. With the exhibition, an important purchase destined for the rooms of the Civic Museum of Ancient Art in Turin is presented to the public. It is the casket with profane medallions in Limoges enamel that belonged to Cardinal di Guala Bicchieri (1160-1227), an important testimony of medieval art of the thirteenth century. While awaiting the end of the restoration works, the work is shown at Palazzo Reale.\n\nExhibition, from 14 December to 2 March. For the first time, it offers the opportunity to admire the most evocative works from the ethnographic collection of the Civic Museum of Ancient Art in Turin, withdrawn from the Civic Museum of Numismatics, Ethnography and Oriental Arts, closed since 2001. Oceania, Africa, Middle East , Pre-Columbian America, Pakistan are the different origins of the numerous and extraordinary works that over the years have become part of the museum's collections thanks to donations from collectors and travellers. Part of the ethnographic collections are currently exhibited at the Mao.\n\nExhibition, from 15 May to 3 November. Thanks to the most important works of the Agnelli Foundation's oriental art collection, never exhibited in public, five thousand years of Chinese art are represented in the Salone del Senato. Curated by Carlo Viano, with the collaboration of Guido Nicelli and Alessandra Serafini.\n\nExhibition, from 6 December to 3 March. The vast exhibition illustrates part of the rich collection of the Sienese institution Santa Maria della Scala, with jewellery, miniatures, reliquaries and fabrics that reconstruct the reliquary tradition in Siena between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\n\n2001 - Gugliemo Caccia known as Moncalvo, Knight embracing a figure (death?) (About 1605) Purchase The characteristics of the drawing exactly correspond to those of one already owned by the Civic Museum with the coronation of a knight (4649/DS) , purchased in 1995. Although even in the case of this drawing the exact identification of the subject is not known, the juxtaposition of the two works allows us to suppose the existence of a cycle of stories centered on the role of the same hero.\n\nThe exhibition, set up in the Sala del Senato, is made up mostly of works from the Museum's medieval collections, enriched over the years with acquisitions that have saved monumental sculptures from dispersion but also wooden furnishings and terracotta frames, evidence of a centuries-old artisan tradition. The occasion, contextual to the first reopening of the Juvarrian avant-corps and of the Medieval Court, also serves to make it visible to the public that the \"Palazzo Madama construction site\", opened in 1988, continues effectively.\n\nThe Municipality clears the ground floor of Palazzo Madama to begin the excavations which will bring to light the remains of the Roman gate and road. A previous archaeological excavation, conducted at the end of the 19th century by Alfredo D'Andrade in the room known as \"il Voltone\", had identified and \"sealed\" them, while leaving them accessible, under the flooring. The royal Peota, the ceremonial boat built in Venice in 1730 by Carlo Emanuele III of Savoy, is taken away and sent to the restoration laboratories of the Nicola company, in Aramengo d'Asti. Today it is on loan at the Venaria Reale deposit."
