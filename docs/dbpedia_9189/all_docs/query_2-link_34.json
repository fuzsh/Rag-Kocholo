The complex ornate white structures topped up with decorative features make it great to marvel at. It features a needle statue and stands out with gold leaves covered everywhere. Beautiful statues and pictures continue to make this basilica standout. The altar of the church is also not left out. It remains grande complimenting the basilica’s heavenly features with small chapels surrounding it. The church remains open for service though it is not usually crowded as expected.\n\n4. Cappella dei Banchieri e dei Mercanti\n\nThis baroque chapel was restored into a great marvel exposing hidden frescoes that will amaze you. It was once a place for bankers and shopkeepers to congregate and indulge in worship ceremonies. Despite its beauty, this church may go unnoticed because it is located close to a big church. Inside the church expect to find some wooden statues that seem to be made out of marble. There is also a golden crown at the altar. An old perpetual calendar that dates back to 1831 can also be found in the sacristy.\n\n5.

It houses a great collection of cars that will entice all car lovers. Some iconic car models such as Citroen DS are authentically presented here. The first of almost every car model can also be found here. Chariots and stem engines are also not left out in this ride back in time. The tour around the museum is very informative as they dedicate a lot of tie analyzing the displayed motors.\n\n6. Armeria Reale\n\nPhoto by commons.wikimedia.org\n\nArmeria Reale hosts a veritable collection of Armour and weapons that have been in existence since 1837. These weapons were collections initiated by King Carlo Alberto. One of the most outstanding pieces is the stuffed horse he owned that stands-out among the swords and guns. Every room within the Armeria Reale gives a different atmosphere as they are ornate to the point of saturation. An entire day can be spent sightseeing the place as it offers a lot.\n\n7. Museo Pietro Micca\n\nThis small museum celebrates the sacrifice of Pietro Micca during the French and Spanish siege. In just three rooms, one can understand the heroic act of Pietro and hoe he was able to save Turin.

This is where Pietro Micca died while setting up explosives in the tunnel which were under the French battle lines.\n\n8. Piazza San Carlo\n\nPhoto by mykaul\n\nPiazza San Carlo is a large square that was designed by Carlo di Castellamonte. This square has been in existence since 1650 and is still thriving.

Mole Antonelliana\n\nThe Mole Antonelliana is a spectacular architectural marvel that stands out in Turin. The whole building is a work of art making it stand out from the rest. The giant pillars at the front are only exterior highlights. It is a shame that it is surrounded by back streets. Most enjoy going to the observatory area with the aid of a suspended elevator in sense that it is made of glass. One also get the chance to peep at the cinematic museum from there.\n\n◎ Closing\n\nThere's a whiff of Paris in this Alp-fringed city that is Turin. All this is evident in its elegant tree-lined boulevards and its stately art nouveau cafes. However, Turin proved to be an industrious city as it gave birth to Fiat that is Italy’s most iconic car.
