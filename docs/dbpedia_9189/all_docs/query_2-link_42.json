From the top of its towers you can admire Turin and a breathtaking view of the Susa Valley. Inside the main church of the Sacra, dating back to the 12th century, members of the royal family of the House of Savoy are buried. Dedicated to the cult of the Archangel Michael, the Sacra di San Michele is part of a pilgrimage route over 2000 km long that goes from Mont Saint-Michel, in France, to Monte Sant'Angelo, in Puglia. The history and the breathtaking landscape that surrounds the abbey make the Sacra a destination of attraction for visitors from all over Europe: pilgrims, faithful, tourists, but also sportsmen who follow climbing or mountain biking trails.\n\nVia alla Sacra, 14, 10057 Sant'Ambrogio di Torino TO, Italia\n\nDay 3 - Susa and its Valley\n\nDescription:\n\nIn less than an hour by train you can reach Susa, the capital of the homonymous valley, one of the most beautiful in Piedmont. Susa is a small but interesting town at the foot of Alps, where it is still possible to visit the ancient Roman ruins, including the aqueduct, the Roman amphitheater and a triumphal arch built in honour of Caesar Augustus. Also not to be missed is the nearby Novalesa Abbey, founded in 726 AD. Located along an important pilgrimage route: the Via Francigena. Furthermore, also near Susa, between the towns of Cesana Torinese and Claviere, there is the longest Tibetan Bridge in the world: a path of 468 meters at a height of 35/40 meters. You will enjoy an uncontaminated and rich nature and many things to see and views to admire.\n\n10059 Susa TO, Italia"
