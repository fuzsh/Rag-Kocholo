        "text": "Milan, Florence, Rome, Venice… these are all famous Italian cities, but Italy is known to have many gems. And since you’re here, you are probably aware of one of them. The beautiful city of Turin, the capital of the Piedmont region in Northwest Italy. But why should you visit Turin in Italy?\n\nWell, I could talk about what makes Turin worth visiting for hours and hours, especially over a bottle of Barolo wine. But I decided to make it simple, so here are 11 reasons to visit Turin that will convince you easily.\n\nTurin was love at first sight. I know it sounds clichè, but after 6 years of traveling the world, it took me only a few days in Turin to choose it as our new home. This love relationship grew with time, as the more I discovered the city, the more I liked it.\n\nNow it’s time to introduce Turin to you, all its uniqueness, attractions in Turin and history that makes it an unmissable destination in Italy. So keep reading, because I will give you 11 reasons to travel to Turin that will make you want to pack your bags and travel now.\n\nWhy should you visit Turin, Italy?\n\nFirst things first, where is Turin? The city of Turin, Torino in Italian, is located in Northwest Italy, quite easy to reach due to its strategic location between the surrounding Alpine valleys. This means that it’s not only a top destination in Italy, but it is also easy to travel to. You can either fly, get a train, a bus, or drive to Turin – it all depends on where you’re coming from, what’s your budget, and your travel style. You can find more about traveling to Turin here.\n\nOnce you get to Turin, be ready to experience Italy at its best! Former capital of the wealthy Duchy of Savoy and currently the greenest Italian city, Turin is all about nature, history, art, eating and drinking. Everything you expect from a holiday in Italy, but with a unique touch, Turin’s touch.\n\n1 – Turin was the first Italian capital\n\nAs I told you before, forget Rome and Florence, Turin was the first capital of Italy, from 1861 to 1865. With this title comes a lot of history, over 20 incredible palaces and royal residences waiting for you to be discovered.\n\nEven if you are not into history, you must visit Turin and take time to explore at least two stunning places. The Royal Palace of Turin and the Royal Armoury Turin’s top attractions where you will have a good glance at the royal past of the city.\n\nThere are many more historical places to visit in Turin, here is a list of the top 7 places and royal residences in Turin, by the way, they are all UNESCO heritage sites. Trust me, it’s worth it to see them in real life.\n\nYou can also see the importance of the city by its architecture, buildings and how the city center was developed from the mid-1500s to the 1800s. This means that when visiting Turin you can witness Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neo-Classical and Art Nouveau architecture. Cool, isn’t it?!\n\nSo expect a medieval quarter, beautiful squares and gardens, huge boulevards and impressive churches. Don’t forget to add to your Turin itinerary a stop at Piazza Castello, Piazza San Carlo, Piazza Vittorio Veneto and Porta Palatina.\n\n2 – Parks, Alps and hills – Turin is a green city\n\nTurin is known for being a European Green Capital, but the city’s relationship with nature and green spaces goes beyond the title. The former Italian industrial hub is giving space to innovation, green transportation and initiatives.\n\nYou will see and stroll around many parks and green spaces when visiting Turin. The most famous one is Valentino Park (Parco Del Valentino), a huge central park dotted with a rose garden, Medieval Village, and endless spots for running, cycling, or just relaxing.\n\nGrab a coffee, a beer or a drink at one of the kiosks and lounge on the grass. This is one of locals’ favorite things to do in Turin, especially during the warm seasons. The Spring and Summer in Turin can be surprisingly hot and sunny, find out more about Turin weather here.\n\nValentino Park is close to the city centre and sits in front of river Po. The river crosses the city and is surrounded by a beautiful promenade with trees, walking and cycling paths. If you follow the river you will find other parks around the city, like Colletta Park and Europa Park (this one has good views of the city).\n\nTurin is surrounded by green hills on one side and the Italian Alps on the other. So if you fancy an easy hike you can venture yourself up to the Basilica Di Superga hill. Plan your hike to see the spectacular sunset over the city, and come down by the historical tram. For experienced hikers, the region offers endless possibilities just one or two hours away from Turin, by car or by train leaving Porta Nuova or Porta Susa stations.\n\n3 – Visit Turin museums, galleries and street art\n\nFrom classic to contemporary art, Turin museums offer a wide range of experiences and impressive collections for any traveler and any art enthusiast. To be precise there are over 40 museums, not to mention the many galleries.\n\nThe most famous museums in Turin are the Egyptian Museum (one of the largest collections in the world), the Royal Palace (Palazzo Reale) that we already mentioned, the National Museum of Italian Cinema located inside Mole Antonelliana – an incredible building, Palazzo Madama and its Museum of Ancient Art, Museum of the Risorgimento at Palazzo Carignano, Pinacoteca Agnelli located at the former Fiat factory building, and others that we will mention later on.\n\nAnother interesting museum in Turin is the Museo della Sindone also known as the Museum of the Shroud, which talks about the Jesus Christ Holy Shroud located at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin.\n\nClearly, Turin has its history well preserved, but that doesn’t mean it stopped in time. There are several contemporary and modern installations, as well as multi-ethnic open-air museums dedicated to art in all its forms. Plus Artissima and Paratissima, the two world-famous events dedicated to contemporary art that happen in Turin.\n\n4 – Turin is a shopping paradise\n\nBy the way, some would say shopping is an art, and in Turin you can be artsy on that too. From top brand discounts at Torino Outlet Village to the local designers spread along the historical center, in Turin, there are endless possibilities for shopping.\n\nYou know that Italy is known for amazing clothes, leather shoes, impressive jewelry and elegant style, so lose yourself at the city’s galleries and shops along the impressive Via Roma and its arcades. Via Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange is also a must, and don’t forget to check all the small streets around. You will find many shops selling from house decor to clothes, accessories, bags and everything in between.\n\n5 – Turin’s Automobile heritage\n\nDo you love cars? Then you’re in for a ride in Turin! The city houses the must-visit Museum of Automobile (Museo dell’Automobile di Torino), with a collection that goes from the 18th century steam-powered models up to the newest sports cars. Speaking of cars, you might know that Turin is the birthplace of the car giant Fiat.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the whole region has a strong business core. Other prominent companies like Azimut (yachts), Argotec (aerospace engineering), Abarth (racing and road cars), and Lavazza (coffee) were either founded or are based in the Torino region.\n\n6 – Wine, Vermouth and Coffee are Turin’s specialties\n\nOh, and very important to mention: Martini & Rossi was founded in Turin, back in 1863, thus making Turin the birthplace of Vermouth and the traditional aperitivo!\n\nYou can taste the city specialty at any bar but if you prefer an immersive experience visit Casa Martini. The museum and factory are just outside Turin and you can learn about and taste this classic that is exported from Turin to the world.\n\nTurin also has great wine, some of the best in the world to be more precise. Barolo and Barbaresco wines are produced in the region, just a couple of hours from Turin. You can visit the beautiful Barolo region by car or book a wine tasting tour (which I highly recommend). During your visit to Turin don’t forget to taste other local wines like Barbera, Dolcetto and Nebbiolo, grapes that are traditional from Piedmont.\n\nTo counterbalance the alcohol, it’s good to know that in Turin you’ll find top-notch coffee for your breakfast or a pick-up espresso after lunch. Let me tell you that coffee is such a serious thing for Torineses (people from Turin) that the city has many factories from local brands to worldwide famous ones. A visit to the Lavazza Museum is the best experience for coffee lovers. Book your coffee guided tour for the morning and be sure to have energy that will last for the day.\n\nAnd you can’t say you visit Turin if you didn’t drink at least one Bicerin. This is Turin’s own recipe for coffee with chocolate and cream, but it tastes completely different from what you have tried before, that’s for sure.\n\n7 – Turin’s Aperitivo, the best happy hour you can experience\n\nTurin is the birthplace of Vermouth and the best way to taste it during an aperitivo. From 6 pm to almost 10 pm bars all over the city will offer incredible drinks (cocktails, beers, wine…) for a fixed price that ranges from 6 EUR to 15 EUR and you get to eat some Italian delicacies included in the price.\n\nIt’s a happy happy hour! Some bars and cafes will serve a plate on your table with finger food, nibbles and chips. Others will have a buffet-style table where you can serve yourself as much as you want. As long as you are ordering drinks, the food will keep coming. The first drink has a fixed price that is a bit more expensive than the menu, the second, third and so on will cost according to the house menu.\n\nThe Italian aperitivo is not only about drinking and eating, but an experience where you can meet locals, relax and even find out where to go for dinner, for more drinks or parties.\n\nEvery neighborhood in Turin has its bars and cafes serving aperitivo. You will find many options around the San Salvario area, Via Roma and the Royal Palace. There are many bars at Via Po and by the river as well. My suggestion is to try a new one every day.\n\n8 – Piedmont cuisine and Turin food scene\n\nFrom drinks with food to typical cuisine. Piedmont traditional food is another reason to visit Turin not only once but at different times of the year. The region is packed with farms and local producers, and in each season you can taste fresh ingredients and typical dishes.\n\nI don’t need to tell you that Italian food is good, but I must tell you the dishes you should taste in Turin. For antipast or a quick bite, try a Tramezzino, Bagna Cauda or Vitello Tonnato. The traditional Grissini and some of the region’s cheese like Tomini, Castelmagno, or Raschera are good options too.\n\nWhen hungry go for a Brasato al Barolo or a pasta dish like Agnolotti del Plin. Anything with truffles will taste delicious, and for a less fancy option, Pizza al Padellino is always a good idea.\n\nIf you still have space for dessert (who doesn’t), I’m happy to tell you that chocolate from Turin is incredible, and also are the cakes and biscuits that melt your mouth. It doesn’t matter if it’s breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, or dinner, there is always a Turin sweet treat waiting for you.\n\nDon’t forget to visit the chocolate shops and historic cafes to taste some of Turin’s finest bonbons paired with smoking hot chocolate during winter or Italian Soda during Summer. A quick note, Nutella is from the region too, and there are gelato shops on every corner. One more reason to visit Turin.\n\nAnother must is a visit to Porta Palazzo, one of the biggest open-air fresh markets in Europe, and have a meal at Mercato Centrale and Eataly. Both are located near Palazzo Reale and Palazzo Madama.\n\n9 – Visit Turin for Juventus\n\nDid you know that Turin is home to Juventus, Italy’s most successful soccer team? Talk about a city that shines, hun!\n\nSoccer (or football) lovers travel to Turin to watch important matches as the city breathes the sport. But even if you are not a soccer fan, a visit to Juventus Stadium and Museum can be great fun.\n\n10 – Party at Kappa FuturFestival\n\nTurin holds the biggest and best summer music festival in Italy. I can tell you that because I have attended a couple of them and OH MY GOD, they organized an amazing party.\n\nKappa FuturFestival is a 3 day/night music festival focused on electronic music, with international acts and unique experiences. It happens at Parco Dora and it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It’s not only a great reason to visit Turin, but it’s also a good reason to come back multiple summers.\n\nHere is a complete Guide to Kappa FuturFestival in Turin so you won’t miss the fun!\n\n11- Turin is still authentic and not overcrowded\n\nOur last reason to visit Piedmont’s capital city is the cherry on the cake. Turin is not as crowded with tourists as other destinations in Italy. In fact, for the size and importance (historically, culturally and economically) Turin is still authentic and with a busy local life waiting to be discovered.\n\nThis gem might not stay hidden from international travelers for too long, so if you want to experience the best of the city, plan your visit to Turin as soon as possible. I promise you will be awed by this elegant city, its history and art."
