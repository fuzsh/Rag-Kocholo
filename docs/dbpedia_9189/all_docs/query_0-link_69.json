        "text": "Pasquale Stanislao Mancini,\n\ndeputy, exile, minister, he had a most important role\n\nin all the great battles which were fought to give us a homeland.1\n\n1 The Turin Faculty of Law\n\nFrom the eighteenth century, the law faculty of the University of Turin was the ‘privileged training institution of the Savoy elites’.2 Shortly after the signing of the Peace of Utrecht (1713), the university of the capital of the new kingdom was reformed by a series of measures implemented in 1720, 1723 and 1729. The aim of Victor Amadeus II, the King of Sardinia, was to give the state control over every aspect of education, in particular ‘preparing fully trained public officials and loyal subjects’.3 Several noteworthy intellectuals, such as the Sicilian Francesco d’Aguirre, and Bernardo Andrea Lama and Mario Agostino Campiani from Rome, were very active in those years of reform.4 However, this renewal process was partly hindered by the conclusion of an agreement between the government of Turin and the Roman Curia in 1727, an event that prompted the reformist intellectuals to leave the Savoy capital.5\n\nNevertheless, some of the proposals put forward by d’Aguirre6 found their way, through the ‘Costituzioni di Sua Maestà per l’Università di Torino’ (1729), into the legislation of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which, among other things, removed secondary school teaching from the control of religious orders. These legal provisions also had the objective of allowing a closer watch on the education of the citizens, instilling in them respect for authority (royal and religious) and, at the same time, forging deep bonds of loyalty to the Savoy monarchy.\n\nWithout any intention of weakening religious orthodoxy, which continued to be seen as an instrumentum regni to support the government, the management of schools of every kind and level passed to the State, in the person of the Magistrate of the Reform, a most sensitive position for which personages of great importance were always chosen.7\n\nThe University of Turin was in a poor state: the increasing scarcity of financial resources allocated to teaching had brought about the departure of its most renowned teachers, and no control was exercised on the activities of the professors and the students. The appeals made by d’Aguirre and Scipione Maffei8 for teaching staff to receive regular remuneration met with some success, progress being made with the Regio biglietto of 3 April 1738, which established ‘a single system of pay, divided into salary bands’,9 which largely remained in force throughout the eighteenth century.\n\nDespite its various difficulties, the period of reform enabled the university to establish better working principles, with the institution structured into four faculties (theology, law, medicine and, from 1721, surgery) with a total of twenty teachers. The selection of professors was left to the Magistrate of the Reform, who drew up a shortlist of candidates, one of whom would be appointed by the sovereign. The faculty of law was organised into five chairs: two professorships of civil law, one of canon law and two of institutional law (civil and canonical, established in 1731).\n\nThe reforms left the law faculty somewhat smaller, despite a number of suggestions made by d’Aguirre, who had proposed the foundation of a chair of ‘de jure naturali, gentium et civili’.10 None of his proposals were accepted, least of all that calling for the establishment of teaching in public law, which was considered too thorny a subject. The situation would remain largely unchanged until the end of the century, and the new charters of 1772 merely confirmed the previous ones. The course curricula were left unchanged, giving the impression that, in contrast to the innovations that were being introduced in other universities in the Italian peninsula, stagnation prevailed in Turin. Among the examples of innovations that could be cited it is worth mentioning the creation of the chair of natural law and the law of nations established on a permanent basis by the University of Pisa in 1738 and that of public law created in Modena in 1767.11 An attempt was made in the early 1730s to establish a chair in jus gentium in Turin, but this was thwarted by strong opposition from the Curialist faction, essentially because they feared that such teaching might call into question the prince’s authority in fiscal matters.12\n\nIn fact, the ‘jus naturale et gentium was never introduced in the university, although it was conceded that the fundamental principles of this science would become part of the curricula of philosophical disciplines’,13 and it was therefore dealt with by teachers of moral philosophy, such as Michele Casati and Sigismondo Gerdil, both of whom were of an anti-Enlightenment persuasion.14\n\nLater, between 1792 and 1798, the university was closed, and then in the Napoleonic era it was reformed several times, while in the early years of the Empire the Faculty of Law saw the number of its students increase significantly.15 After the first liberal uprisings, the university was partially reopened following a closure that lasted from 1821 to 1823, albeit under the rigid control of the Piedmontese government.16 From that point on it lived in a ‘state of mediocrity’17 until the winds of change that began to blow in the early 1830s; in 1832, the famous French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy was called to the chair of sublime physics (but in fact mathematical physics in general) in the Faculty of Sciences.18 Of greater pertinence to our discussion, however, was the speech delivered in the Senate by Federigo Sclopis in 1844, in which he underlined the need to improve the teaching of law.19 The king, Charles Albert, was convinced that the kingdom’s bureaucratic-administrative cadres should be educated in the Faculty of Law and initiated a reform plan aimed at updating the subjects and methods of teaching, relying on people of great prestige and experience. For this reason, in 1844 he appointed Cesare Alfieri di Sostegno, a member of the Council of State since its establishment in 1837, as Magistrate for the Reform.20 Evidence of this royal support for reform was shortly after seen in the establishment of chairs of mechanics and mechanical chemistry on the eve of the establishment of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1848 and, above all, through the Regio biglietto of 6 December 1845, of the Faculty of Political Economy. This subject had previously been introduced during the period of French rule and was confirmed in 1817 but abolished after the uprisings of 1821.21 The Neapolitan economist Antonio Scialoja,22 who was very close to Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, was appointed head of this faculty to lead the teaching of the subject. Mancini followed closely Scialoja’s incorporation into Savoy society, writing both to Sclopis himself23 and, especially, to Carlo Ilarione Petitti di Roreto: ‘tell me frankly what impact he [Scialoja] has had on the chair and in private society, I am hoping for good news’.24\n\nScialoja’s lessons, which began in January 1846,25 were a great success, being warmly received by the public and often attended by many subalpine intellectuals, such as Cesare Balbo,26 Cesare Alfieri, Count Camillo Benso di Cavour,27 Ilarione Petitti28 and Quintino Sella, who wrote enthusiastic accounts of the course delivered by the Neapolitan economist.29\n\nOther professors already working for the university welcomed these signs of renewal. For example, Felice Merlo, a professor of the institutions of civil law, also spoke about natural law, explaining it in his lessons alongside the ideas of Vico, according to whom the jus naturae meant ‘working in conformity with what one recognizes as true’.30 Merlo’s thinking had been influenced by his friend Vincenzo Gioberti, and Merlo began to promote ‘Gioberti’s “true theory of natural law”’, according to which ‘man’s perception of the world and of himself is that of a continuous creation’.31 At the root of these concepts was the belief that, on the one hand, man accepted the idea of the existence of a supreme and absolute legislator and, on the other, with the use of reason was able to deduce general legal rules, inferring from them more specific ones that would form the ‘actually applicable positive law’.32\n\nAnother academic open to the renewal of legal studies was Pietro Luigi Albini, who in 1839 wrote Saggio analitico sul diritto e sulla scienza e istruzione politico legale (Analytical Essay on Law and on the Science of and Education in Politics and Law),33 in which he attempted to provide a broad general picture of all areas of jurisprudence.\n\nThe emphasis placed on renewal was fully grasped by Cesare Alfieri di Sostegno, who set up a Senate commission to draw up a plan for the reorganization of legal studies, and it was no coincidence that this included, among others: Federico Sclopis and Giuseppe Siccardi (presidents), Felice Merlo (member) and Albini (secretary).34 The most important novelty of the reform was the creation of a two-year finishing course of law that was open to graduate students whose ambition was to teach or join the College of Doctors of the Faculty of Law.35\n\nEmboldened by royal support, Cesare Alfieri was able to create numerous chairs: the teaching of public and international law was assigned in 1847 to Felice Merlo, but he could teach only the inaugural lecture course as he took on numerous political commitments in 1848, first the vice-presidency of the Senate, subsequently a ministerial post, and then the office of prime minister.36\n\nHowever, in this period international law was not yet a subject in its own right but was taught as part of public law. In 1849 the course ‘Public Constitutional and Institutional Law’ was assigned to L. Amedeo Melegari, who, however, ended up limiting his focus to the exegesis of the articles of the constitution.37 The subjects were split up only in 1850, with the creation of a professorship for Pasquale Stanislao Mancini, who began teaching on 22 January 1851. Thus the University of Turin became the first in Italy to offer a course in international law separate from those of internal and external public law.38 It is therefore time to concentrate our attention on Mancini.\n\n2 The Turin Chair of Pasquale Stanislao Mancini\n\nAs we have seen, Mancini had for some time been in correspondence with several subalpine intellectuals, whom he had met during the congresses of scientists in which he had taken part in Naples (1845) and Genoa (1846)39 or with whom he had made contact when working as a journalist. For a long time he had corresponded in particular with Federico Sclopis, but the Turinese archives also preserve his letters to Ilarione Petitti, Carlo Ignazio Giulio, Pier Dionigi Pinelli, Domenico Carutti and Domenico Berti, all of them prominent figures in Turin.40 Thanks to such acquaintances and to his fame as a jurisconsult, he was able to create an important space for himself in the society of intellectuals and political figures in Savoy, giving rise in its capital to a lively salon frequented by both exiles and Piedmontese politicians.41\n\nA complex figure who has not yet been the subject of an academic biography,42 Mancini, despite having a wide-ranging curiosity that had led him to study music, literature and translation, remained essentially a jurisconsult steeped in Enlightenment culture.43 Despite some valuable reconstruction of his biography there is a lack of in-depth study of his internationalist thinking, and so it is possible only to highlight some of the most significant moments of his life here,44 before examining the first two university courses that he taught in Turin in order to ascertain which sources he used to support his arguments.\n\nBorn in 1817 in Castel Baronia, in the province of Avellino, Mancini was educated in the seminary of Ariano Irpino and the Salvatore lycée in Naples, before he went on to obtain his degree in law, also in Naples, in 1835, the year of his first appearance in court.\n\nHis debut on the political scene was made in the tumultuous period of 1848 in Naples, specifically during the events of 15 May 1848, when the Bourbon army fought on the streets of Naples against insurgents who had erected barricades in defence of the Chamber that had been elected but not allowed to meet. This prohibition was a gesture that Mancini, himself a supporter of the protest signed by sixty-six deputies, called ‘an act of blind and incorrigible despotism’.45 This was a crucial moment in the history of the Italian south because it was in that very year that the ‘monarchy–nation relationship’ was traumatically torn apart.46\n\nOnce Ferdinand II issued the order to dissolve the Chamber on 13 March 1849, Mancini repeatedly came to the defence of the former deputies who had been subjected to persecution by the Bourbon monarchy.47 He himself ran the risk of being arrested but, having been warned of his imminent capture, managed to board a French ship and reached safety in Genoa before finally seeking refuge in Turin, where he arrived on 5 October 1849.48\n\nAccording to Augusto Pierantoni,49 in the first half of the nineteenth century three political factions were active on the Italian peninsula: the legitimists (conservatives), or those in favour of absolute governments; the reformists (liberals), supporters of freedom and independence; and the unitarian republicans (democrats or radicals), inspired by the ideas of Giuseppe Mazzini. Despite the fact that he had not given a systematic form to his political ideas, Mancini may be considered a reformist, insofar as he was the conveyor of a clear liberal project based on three points: secularism, legal rationalism and utility.50 He was an exponent of the liberal group which maintained good relations with both moderate liberals and democratic liberals, as his cordial rapport with Lorenzo Valerio demonstrated.51\n\nThe Irpinian jurist soon entered the nerve centres of ministerial circles, being appointed during 1850 as a member of the commission established for the revision of civil and criminal legislation as well as that tasked with rationalizing judicial statistics. With the passing of the special ‘law’ of 1850 he was given a professorship in international law at the Faculty of Law, University of Turin. This moment is of particular relevance and merits closer examination.52\n\nOn 12 April 1850 the Minister of Public Instruction, Cristoforo Mameli, presented a bill to the Senate aimed at establishing a chair that would assist young men who wished to pursue a diplomatic career. The new subject would be called ‘special instruction in consular and diplomatic science’ and would expound ‘the principles of the modern European law of nations’,53 focusing in particular on maritime law and the history of treaties. However, access to state diplomacy was almost exclusively in the hands of the aristocracy, which would not tolerate the idea that a degree in law could become a privileged qualification for diplomatic careers. Federico Sclopis realized that the project, if formulated that way, would have aroused strong opposition from the nobility. In a report to the Senate of 7 May 1850 he therefore presented a new plan which left aside allusions to a diplomatic career and proposed the creation of a new chair of external public and international private law.54 After debate in the Senate and in the Chamber of Deputies, the plan was passed into law in November 1850.55 But during the Senate debate there had been no lack of objections. In particular, Ermolao Asinari of San Marzano, deeming it not appropriate to give the Faculty of Law a new course, had asked for the provision to be postponed until 1851, when discussions would take place on ‘a new formation of the law course and […] a new coordination of its chairs’.56 Mameli rejected the objections, underlining that the subjects (modern law of nations, maritime law in relation to public law, and history of treaties) that would be taught in the new course were ‘useful and necessary in any form of government to almost all orders of citizens’.57 The draft law was approved, with thirty-three votes in favour and fifteen opposed.\n\nMancini, whose notoriety had grown considerably after the publication, in 1841, of his exchange of letters with Terenzio Mamiani on the right to punish,58 had begun to take an interest in international law in 1844, when he published his essay ‘Esame di un’opera di diritto internazionale pubblicata da Nicola Rocco’ (Examination of a Work of International Law Published by Nicola Rocco).59 In 1839–1840, he had opened a private law school in Naples that became one of the best in the city,60 and in 1847 he was appointed substitute in the chair in natural law at the University of Naples. The Bourbon government removed him from this chair on 5 December 1849 following his escape to Turin.61\n\nMancini made his debut in Turin with an inaugural lecture that particularly inflamed the audience, due to its references to freedom and the ‘right to nationality’.62 The teaching of international law was part of the finishing course until the reform of 9 October 1856 which inserted the subject into the ordinary five-year course of the Faculty of Law, making it mandatory for students, who would take it for the whole of their final year.63\n\n3 Some of the Sources for Mancini’s Turin Lectures\n\nThe importance of Mancini’s inaugural lecture has been emphasized many times.64 On the very first pages of it he stated that ‘nationality, as the rational basis of the law of nations’,65 would be the ‘first and cardinal idea that will dominate my course’,66 and he went on to underline that the pioneers of the discipline were two Italians, Pierino Belli d’Alba and Alberico Gentili, but ‘Grotius’s great work obscured and dominated all the earlier ones’.67\n\nAccording to Mancini, in the previous century the doctrine of the law of nations had not made any great progress. Emer de Vattel, for example, had limited himself to ‘making Wolff’s doctrine French’, offering ‘a type of compendium’ of it, one characterized by ‘an overly superficial scientific levity’ and by ‘frequent oscillation and uncertainty in the application of principles’.68 This brief quotation alone clearly demonstrates Mancini’s negative view of Vattel, whose work he saw as a defective if not pejorative summary of Christian Wolff’s complex ideas. More generally, however, these two thinkers ‘did not go beyond Grotius’s principle of a law concerning relations between states’.69\n\nAfter considering the constituent elements of the nation (‘reason, race, language, customs, history, laws and religions’)70 and the concept of nationality (a ‘collective expression of liberty’, and a ‘holy and divine thing, like liberty itself’)71 Mancini concluded that when international law was born, the basic unit was the nation rather than the state, as Grotius and Vattel72 had argued. For them the law of nations coincided with the natural law of states, whereas for Mancini it coincided with the natural law of peoples.\n\nIn the first lecture of his first course Mancini took up some of the arguments that he had set out in his inaugural lecture by once again presenting Vattel as a ‘summarizer’ of Wolff and underlining that both continued to enjoy great fame ‘despite the superficiality of their doctrines’.73 He therefore agreed with Pellegrino Rossi when he claimed that international relations were still governed by empirical principles.74 However, it should be noted that in the comparison between Wolff and Vattel the German is mentioned only seven times while the Swiss is cited more than twenty times, in eighteen lectures out of the sixty-seven.75 It might almost be argued that Mancini examined Wolff’s ideas through the filter of Vattel, through which he also considered other aspects of the doctrine.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to ascertain which parts of Vattel’s Droit des gens influenced the reflections of the Irpinian jurist. If we consider together all the quotations of Vattel in Mancini’s course we note that his examination focused primarily on book III of the Droit, ‘De la guerre’.76 In most cases Mancini tended to present a doctrine set out by Grotius prior to considering how subsequent scholars took up or criticized the Dutch jurist’s thesis and, as mentioned, only rarely did Mancini compare the theories of Wolff with those of Vattel. The Grotius–Pufendorf–Vattel line was more common than the Grotius–Wolff–Vattel one.77 The impression gleaned from this is that the theories of the Swiss jurist were considered by Mancini to have been a continuation of Grotius’s theses, although Vattel ultimately gave a distorted and therefore pejorative image of his doctrine.78\n\nThe negative evaluation of Vattel’s thought, albeit only with regard to Grotius and not to Wolff, was a consequence of the fact that Mancini was very critical of the concept of just war; furthermore, negotiations aimed at consolidating the theory of political equilibrium was a practice that he despised.\n\nThe ‘deceptions of mendacious diplomacy’79 had generated the perverse mechanism of the principle of equilibrium,80 according to which changes in territory could not be tolerated, since the increase of one state’s power would be detrimental to other states. The principle of equilibrium had the shortcoming of not taking into account that of aggregation81 and was configured only as a preventive measure based on suspicion and fear. Mancini’s conclusion was clear: ‘we will declare the principle of equilibrium unfair. Unjust because it is unfair to offend someone that I feared for some reason and to anticipate with a present injustice a future one’.82\n\nAnother interesting example is the concept of just war, which Mancini rejected, deeming it an ‘absurd, immoral and prideful theory’.83 He dedicated four lessons to the argument,84 beginning with the theories elaborated by Grotius.85 Grotius distinguished between justificatory and exculpatory wars; he thought that defensive conflicts were always just, as were those fought to right a wrong or to punish an injury received, and he also attempted to limit punitive wars to the latter case.86 Vattel largely agreed with Grotius’s theory, but had drawn ‘worse consequences, creating a horrendous and savage theory’,87 as he had highlighted the fact that the purpose of all wars was to punish an offence already received or believed to be imminent and, moreover, that the legitimate aim of war was revenge by means of an unforgettable example that would discourage other attacks.88\n\nIn fact, in the aforementioned examples the polemical target was twofold, in that Mancini targeted the doctrine formulated by Vattel on the one hand, and the European political situation that came about after the Congress in Vienna on the other. While taking into account that this is a shorthand version of Mancini’s lectures, and that, therefore, we are dealing with a text designed for oral rather than written dissemination,89 the Irpinian jurist did not mince his words when expressing his opposition to the political system resulting from the agreements signed at the 1815 congress, whose overall result was defined as a ‘germ of death’90 or as an ‘infamous’91 pact of alliance between conservative forces aimed at trampling on and mortifying the principle of nationality.\n\nThe protests raised by the Austrian government against an exiled teacher who aimed to inflame subalpine youth were therefore hardly surprising. Mancini had in fact said:\n\nDo you believe that pity for Lombardy is the unique cause of the grudges that the peoples of all Italy feel for Austria? Or is it the continuous interventions that it has made to extinguish in them every small spark of freedom? Not only in these, but in all civilized nations a badly simulated cry and a curse against the future could arise against the thugs and dispossessors of every bad and formless government.92\n\n4 By Way of Conclusion\n\nFrom these brief notes it emerges how an important element of Mancini’s thought, which came to the fore in the Turin lessons, was that of giving a new significance to the concept of the nation, thus counterbalancing the dominant theoretical importance that was attributed to the state. The prevalence of the concept of nation had meant that certain jurists, such as Vattel, had placed the concept of the state at the centre of their theoretical elaboration, a conceptual category also used to explain the formation of modern international law. Consequently, within these currents of thought, if the concept of the nation was defined, it appeared destined to be subordinated to that of the state and therefore in the terminological dialectic state–nation, the second was always put in the shade.93\n\nBoth Mancini and Vattel94 saw the state and the nation as two distinct concepts but, whereas for the Swiss jurist the first had precedence over the second, for the Irpinian jurisconsult the idea of the nation came before that of the state. That is, Mancini completely overturned Vattel’s perspective and, demonstrating that the nation would end up resolving itself legally in the state, defuse the revolutionary implications of the notion of the state.\n\nIt seems that we can exclude any influence of Giuseppe Mazzini from this discussion, since the republican option that was central to the Genoese intellectual meant that he was ignored by the ‘textual circuits of the nineteenth-century jurists’.95 As Federico Chabod pointed out, one could ask of Mazzini ‘neither a treatise on the nation, nor a clear and precise plan of how to build […] the United States of Europe. […] But […] for the nation, the … theoretical, well-coordinated treatise, would be drafted by the jurist Pasquale Stanislao Mancini in 1851: not by Mazzini’.96\n\nHowever, at this point some further reflections are necessary, since the conceptions of state and nation in Vattel and Mancini are divergent. The Swiss jurist became a target of Mancini because the Droit des gens was one of the theoretical bases of the Congress of Vienna, having been guilty of raising the concept of equilibrium to the level of a political system. The popularity that Vattel enjoyed within the major European diplomatic missions had to be discredited, by demonstrating his theoretical fragility.\n\nBut the notion that the state took precedence over the nation was actually the result of an opportunistic and subsequent interpretation of Vattel’s work. Indeed, if we read the Préliminaires of the Droit des gens carefully, nation and state appear to coincide,97 but for Mancini this equivalence, which had descended upon the nineteenth-century political scene, was not acceptable but had to be strongly criticized, since accepting it would have meant endorsing the idea that existing states should not undergo territorial changes. For him it became fundamentally important to develop a more fluid, broader concept of the nation, which is why he preferred to speak of nationality.\n\nAccording to him, the nation was like a family98 whose members, however, finding themselves scattered across several states, felt the urgent need to join together in the name of a series of characteristics that made them similar.99 Nationality, according to Mancini, had to be transformed from a right to a ‘legal duty’, thus making it possible to obtain ‘unity of territory’.100 Therefore, by decontextualizing the Droit des gens – as indeed his political adversaries also did – he used it as an ideological tool to refute the theses of those who denied the relevance of the modern principle of nationality.101\n\nThese positions held by Mancini would evolve once the territorial unity of the Italian peninsula had been achieved in 1870, and would change again when he held the post of foreign minister, from 1881 to 1885. Contrary to what he had argued, he did not hesitate to sign the Triple Alliance in 1882, even though this involved the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had been the polemical target of his first two university courses in Turin; nor did he hesitate to drag the young Italian state into an adventurous colonial policy.102\n\nAnother point to emphasize is that Mancini’s ideas had no utopian dimension.103 His concept of nation was tied to a clear political objective pursued in his threefold role as a parliamentary deputy, teacher and lawyer: that of Italy’s right to become a nation state. With the term ‘nation’, Mancini referred to a natural pre-state and pre-political society of men and to a right of peoples, whose binding elements were religion, race, language, traditions and laws, and above all the ‘consciousness of nationality’.104 These characteristics – which contributed to the creation of a profound ‘commonality of law’,105 not to be found, for example, between individuals belonging to different nations – rendered superfluous the use of ‘the artifices of a political pact or a social contract whose inevitable outcome was only a state subject with a strong authoritarian and oppressive purpose’,106 since, ultimately, the unity of a nation ran parallel with the unity of a state.107\n\nThe concept of the nation therefore stands at the centre of Mancini’s reflection, the essence of which is found in the consciousness of nationality, which is expressed in a ‘moral unity of a common thought, of a predominant idea that makes a society what it is, because it is realized in it’.108 It is this ‘spiritual element’ that animates nationalities. Thus, following the thread of Mancini’s reflections, we arrive at a fuller definition of the concept of nationality: ‘a natural society of men […] conformed to a commonality of life and social conscience’.109 It follows that the development of nationality becomes for men not a right, but a legal duty. The Italian jurist’s conclusions are of great interest since he ends up equating nationality on an individual level with human freedom and, on a more general level, with the ‘collective explication of freedom’, it follows that nationality ‘is as holy and divine a thing as freedom itself’.110\n\nArchival Sources\n\nArchivio Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (AAST), Turin, Italy, Fondo Carteggi, 26985.\n\nArchivio Museo Nazionale del Risorgimento di Torino (AMNRIT), Turin, Italy, Archivi Storici, Fondo Petitti, 1080.\n\nBiblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Rome, Italy, Fondo Patetta, Autografi e documenti, P.
