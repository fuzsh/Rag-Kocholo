        "meta_description": "This relatively small square is surrounded by places of historic interest. On the eastern side is the Carignano theatre and the historic Cambio restaurant. The opposite side of the square is completely taken up by the beautiful facade of Palazzo Carignano, whose curved lines represent one of the most original examples of Piedmontese baroque by Guarino Guarini in 1679. This was the Savoy residence, the home of the Subalpine House of Commons and of the first Italian parliament. Nowadays, it is the National Museum of the Risorgimento.",
