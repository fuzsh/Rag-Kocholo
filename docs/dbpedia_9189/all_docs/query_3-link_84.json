Climate zone classifications are derived from the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, which divides climates into five main climate groups divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns. The five main groups are A (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar). All climates except for those in the E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation sub-group (second letter).  Climate classifications are identified by hovering your mouse over the legend. A narrative overview of Sweden's country context and climate is provided following the visualizations.",

A narrative overview of Sweden's country context and climate is provided following the visualizations.\n\nSweden extends from latitudes 55° N - 69° N and longitudes 11° E - 23°E, with a land area of 408,150 km2. Urban land makes up 3% of the land area, while productive forest land account for 58%, farmland 8%, wetlands 13%, mires, rock surface, subalpine woodlands and high mountains 17%, and other land 2%. Inland water systems total more than 40,000 km2, or more than 9% of the total area. In the past 50 years, farmland has successively given way to other land uses, mainly forest land. This has resulted in reduced emissions from agriculture and increased carbon sequestration in forest biomass. Sweden’s population is approximately 10.4 million (2020). Sweden’s economy is supported by its services, manufacturing, construction, and industry sectors that have resulted in a strongly export-oriented economy in Sweden."
