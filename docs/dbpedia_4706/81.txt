The world’s second-biggest airline by market value, Southwest Airlines, is a major U.S. low-cost carrier headquartered in Dallas, Texas and serves more than 120 destinations across the U.S., Mexico, and Central America. Despite being headquartered in Dallas, Southwest Airlines’ largest hubs lie outside of its home state. Southwest Airlines’ largest hubs are Denver International Airport and Chicago Midway, with approximately 11.6 and 10.3 million Southwest passengers handled at the respective airports.

After the merger of Orlando-based AirTran Airways in late 2014 under the Southwest Airlines brand, the company’s operating income almost doubled, from 2.2 billion U.S. dollars to 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2015. The merger also provided growth in the domestic passenger market. In 2015, Southwest Airlines became the leading carrier in terms of market share and surpassed its main competitors, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. The airline was not able to maintain its domestic supremacy but remained the third largest airline in the domestic market in the United States between March 2023 and February 2024.

Impact of COVID-19 on the airline's performance

The coronavirus pandemic heavily impacted the airline's performance; between 2019 and 2020, the airline’s passenger numbers dropped by close to 60 percent and the company registered a net loss of over three million dollars. Southwest Airlines finances began to recover in 2021, when the airline recorded a net income of 977 million U.S. dollars. Continued impacts of the COVID-pandemic, winter storms in late 2022, and pilot and stuff shortages led to further travel disruptions and impacted Southwest’s profitability. In 2023, the airline recorded a net income of 456 million U.S. dollars, which was smaller than 2021, and 2022 figures.

Customer satisfaction

According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), the company scored 78 points in 2024, with 100 being the highest and best possible customer satisfaction score. The airline has consistently performed above the airline average, and was outranked by Alaska Airlines and American Airlines in terms of consumer satisfaction, with 82 and 79 points, respectively. That year, the other main competitor of Southwest, Delta Air Lines had an ACSI score of 77 points.
