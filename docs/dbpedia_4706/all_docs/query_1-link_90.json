        "text": "Launched 30 years ago, the Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair disrupted the European airline industry and started the low-cost revolution in Europe. Ryanair is now Europe’s largest airline with more than 90 million passengers per year and shows record profits of 875 million euros [1]. Behind the success of Ryanair is the very effective alignment of its customer value proposition with its low-cost operating model.\n\nThe Business Model\n\nRyanair’s low-cost model was initially copied from the U.S-based airline Southwest. The company’s business model is straightforward: To offer cheap air transportation to fare-conscious customers. Ryanair targets customers who might otherwise choose alternative modes of transportation or not travel at all [1]. The company focuses mostly on inter-European, short-haul flights.\n\nThe Operating Model\n\nWith an aggressive approach of “innovation by substraction” [3], the company simplified the operating model further and ‘outSouthwested’ Southwest. Ryanair’s operating model disrupted many common industry practices and allowed the company to outperform all of its competitors on costs per seat and per passenger [4] (Ryanair’s closest competitor, EasyJet, has a cost per passenger 67% higher [9])\n\nOne can analyze Ryanair’s operating model through two different components: Structural and Executional. The structural component is related to the operations strategy or “doing the right things”, while the executional component is more about the efficiency of “doing things right”.\n\nOperating Model: Structure:\n\nAirports: Ryanair flies to small secondary airports, which are sometimes located further away from the city centers. This not only helps reduce airport taxes, but also allows Ryanair to secure subsidies from local city councils who want to attract Ryanair’s tourists! [5] These airports also allow a quick turnaround time, which means that the company can achieve a high fleet utilization.\n\nPoint-to-Point Routes: As opposed to a hub-and-spoke model used by national airlines, Ryanair’s model is a point-to-point model, which reduces customer transfer costs.\n\nDistribution: In order to improve its margins without increasing end-customer prices, Ryanair opted for online direct to customer sale and bypassed the expensive intermediary that travel agencies are.\n\nOperating Model: Execution\n\nLabor Costs: Ryanair has the lowest labor costs in the industry (6€ per passenger – vs 9€ and 17€ for competitors EasyJet and AirBerlin [5]). To achieve these results, Ryanair has used three levers:\n\nLabor Utilization: A large majority of Ryanair’s pilots are actually not salaried employees but third party contractors [5]. With these type of contracts, Ryanair only pays pilots when they are effectively flying and fully utilized.\n\nProfessional Fees: Employees compensation is set-up to include any potential professional fees. This incentivizes the employees to use low cost hotels and transports. (e.g. Crews have been reported to be staying at a low cost camping resorts in the south of France ! [5])\n\nSalaries: By using Irish labor contracts with its employees, the company avoids the rules on wages and social benefits that are required by some European countries [6].\n\nStandard Fleet: Ryanair uses a single type of jet (Boeing 737) for its entire fleet. This enables Ryanair to reduce its Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul costs, reduce its staff training, and increase flexibility in staff allocation.\n\nThe Virtuous Cycle of Business and Operating Model Alignment\n\nRyanair’s business and operating model’s alignment create virtuous cycles through which the business model enables the operating model, which in turn strengthens the value proposition and the competitive advantage of the company [2].\n\nFor example, the company’s business model is about offering low prices, these low prices generate high volumes, which strengthen the company’s operating model: The high volumes enable the company to gain a strong bargaining power with suppliers and secure high fleet utilization, both of which lead to even lower costs, lower prices and increased competitiveness.\n\nSimilarly, because the business model is centered on low prices, the value proposition means that customers have lower quality expectations, which in turn allows the company to not offer free checked-in luggage or meals, something that leads to even lower costs and prices [2]. According to Ryanair’s CEO, the business decision to stop offering free checked-in luggage was not expected to create a revenue stream. It was a way to shift customer behavior into carrying less luggage and simplify Ryanair’s operations (e.g by shutting down the ‘lost bags operation’). This allowed the company to significantly reduce their costs.\n\nThe way forward\n\nRyanair is currently undergoing a shift in its strategy: It is now aiming to improve its customer service and target business travelers [5]. It will be interesting to see if and how the operating model is going to be adjusted to match the new business model, in order to create new virtuous cycles.\n\nSources :\n\n[1] https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/07/Annual-Report-2015.pdf\n\n[2] https://hbr.org/2011/01/how-to-design-a-winning-business-model\n\n[3] http://www.innovationmanagement.se/imtool-articles/innovation-by-subtraction/\n\n[4] http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/ryanair-swot-low-costs-remain-the-key-strength-even-as-customer-service-enhancements-take-root-186145\n\n[5] http://www.challenges.fr/entreprise/transports/20150902.CHA8941/ryanair-la-machine-a-cash-contrainte-au-virage-force.html\n\n[6] http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-22/ryanair-clashes-with-denmark-over-labor-laws\n\n[7] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10996171/Why-do-you-pay-to-check-in-baggage-with-Ryanair.html\n\n[9] http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/ryanair-swot-analysis–michael-olearys-maniacal-focus-on-being-the-lowest-cost-producer-96465"
