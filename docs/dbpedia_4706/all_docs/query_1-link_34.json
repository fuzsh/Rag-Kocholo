But I am almost positive that the industry will shake itself out over time going forward.\n\nAlso, a bit surprised where JetBlue and Spirit fell on the list and kind of curious where they may fall after the merger (if approved and happens).\n\nMost airlines are now much smaller than they were before the pandemic. See the 20 biggest airlines in the world ranked by available seats.\n\nThe US' \"Big Four\" airlines and several Chinese carriers made the list with hundreds of millions of seats offered in 2021.\n\nThat's really a stretch. \"Available Seats at Departure\" isn't even a recognized metric except for this Yahoo part-time analyst-writer...\n\nThe actual metrics which matter are Available Seat Miles (seats x distance carried) and Revenue per Available Seat Miles (Revenue / (seats x distance carried). And then there's Cost per Available Seat Mile (Expenses / (seats x distance carried))\n\nThat's really a stretch. \"Available Seats at Departure\" isn't even a recognized metric except for this Yahoo part-time analyst-writer...\n\nThe actual metrics which matter are Available Seat Miles (seats x distance carried) and Revenue per Available Seat Miles (Revenue / (seats x distance carried).

Like I said itll be short lived after the industry shakes itself out post pandemic and all.\n\nRead the article E. It says nothing about miles, it's all about the seats offered, so yes it did happen for the first time. And as I stated before, also very short lived.\n\nUh, I don't think it happened the first time. Pretty certain Southwest was still #4 in terms of revenue passenger miles.\n\nMaybe you should draw ✍️ pictures for him.\n\nVisualizing Well-Known Airlines by Fleet Composition\n\nWhat type of aircraft do the world’s largest airlines use?
