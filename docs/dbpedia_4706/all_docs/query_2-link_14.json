        "text": "This week we celebrate 10 incredible years of flying to Mexico! From our very first flight, where we were greeted by Mayan warriors on the ramp, to now, we‚Äôve created countless memories and connections with our amazing Customers and Employees. As we look back on this journey, we are grateful for the vibrant cultures, stunning destinations, and the friendships we've built along the way. Thank you to everyone who has flown with us and made this journey possible. Here‚Äôs to many more years of adventure and exploration together!\n\nWe‚Äôve been cookin‚Äô up some magic with Visit Orlando, New Orleans & Company, and Walt Disney World! In celebration of Walt Disney World Resort‚Äôs new attraction, Tiana‚Äôs Bayou Adventure, we flew 24 aspiring chefs from Louisiana to embark upon a culinary adventure of a lifetime at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. In partnership with Visit Orlando, Walt Disney World, and New Orleans & Company we had the opportunity to whisk these young chefs away onboard a flight from New Orleans to Orlando and back after a few days of nonstop fun. They were greeted at the gate with a classic New Orleans party, complete with a jazz band, second line, and Disney goodies ‚Äì just another Tuesday in the bayou state! The party continued inflight where everyone was surprised with Tiana‚Äôs cookbook full of creole recipes and other keepsakes. The group enjoyed a ride down the bayou of Walt Disney World‚Äôs new attraction inspired by, ‚ÄúThe Princess and The Frog.‚Äù Did you know Tiana‚Äôs character was modeled after the late, great Leah Chase, lovingly known as the Queen of Creole Cuisine? Stella, Leah‚Äôs daughter and Zoe, Leah‚Äôs great-granddaughter joined the trip, inspiring these young ladies with advice along their four-day journey. While the ride was the main attraction, the chefs were dazzled by the magic of Walt Disney World with exclusive culinary experiences, tours of famed restaurants, and advice from seasoned executive chefs at the Most Magical Place on Earth. We loved cooking up a good time with our Customers and Employees alike as we hosted this talented group who, like Princess Tiana, are ‚ÄòAlmost There‚Äô in reaching their dreams.\n\nWe‚Äôre celebrating 10 years of Repurpose with Purpose, our award-winning global environmental sustainability initiative that upcycles aircraft seat leather! With the help of community partners across the globe, we have upcycled more than one million pounds of aircraft seat leather, fostering sustainable solutions with a transformative community impact. Earlier this year, students from the Austin area were treated to a tour of the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS) where their art, made with upcycled leather, is on display. In partnership with EcoRise, Southwest connected leather to classrooms, providing students with hands-on experiences in sustainability, creative reuse, and environmental literacy via EcoRise curriculum. Check out the exhibit on display at Austin Airport until September, 2024.\n\nThis week, we celebrated the launch of our newest partnership with the National Park Foundation! Our extensive network now serves as a gateway to over 400 breathtaking national parks across the country. From the towering sequoias of Yosemite to the otherworldly landscapes of Yellowstone, the great outdoors are calling!
