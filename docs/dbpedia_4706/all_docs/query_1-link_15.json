        "text": "Global aeroplane manufacturer, Boeing and Southwest Airlines have announced that the carrier will increase its commitment to the fuel-efficient 737 MAX family. The order of 108 737-7s supports Southwest’s modernisation strategy and allows the flexibility to expand its fleet.\n\n“We have a long history with Boeing, dating back more than 50 years to the day we commenced service with three Boeing 737 aircraft serving three cities. They’re part of our history and part of our future as we continue to recognize the many efficiencies and cost savings of a single fleet.”\n\nBob Jordan, President & Chief Executive Officer of Southwest Airlines.\n\nSouthwest Airlines has been served by the 737 family for many years and aided the airline’s continuous growth. Southwest have an impressive list of orders with over 300 orders for the 737-7, growing the orderbook further with more than 500 737 MAX jets. Once certified, the 737-7 will join the carrier’s all-Boeing 737 fleet.\n\n“With the world’s largest all-Boeing, all-737 fleet, Southwest is counting on the exceptional efficiency and reliability of the 737 MAX family. The 737-7 is pivotal to Southwest’s long-term fleet modernization strategy, and we are honored to have the airline’s continued trust in us to deliver its future fleet.”\n\nStan Deal, President and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nWith the capability of flying up to 3,800 nautical miles, the 737-7 has the longest range in its class. Compared to previous generations of aircraft, the enhanced environmental performance of the 737 MAX allows carriers to reduce fuel. The 737 MAX is also quieter, creating a smaller noise footprint than the older jets it replaces.\n\nBoeing set the standards as a leading global aerospace company by developing, manufacturing and servicing commercial aeroplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries. Boeing’s diverse team is committed to innovating for the future, leading with sustainability, and cultivating a culture based on the company’s core values of safety, quality and integrity."
