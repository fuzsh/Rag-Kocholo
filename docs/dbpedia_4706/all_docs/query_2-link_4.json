Since 2010, Southwest has returned more than $13.5 billion to Shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. From early 2020 through third quarter 2022, the Company's dividend was suspended due to the uncertainties of the pandemic and the requirements of the Company's Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) financings. On December 6, 2022, Southwestâ€™s Board of Directors reinstated and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.18 per share, or $.72 per share annualized, equivalent to its quarterly dividend prior to the pandemic. Through the first half of 2024, Southwest returned $215 million to Shareholders through payment in dividends."
