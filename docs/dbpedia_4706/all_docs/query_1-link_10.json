        "text": "The global low cost carrier market size was valued at USD 270.42 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 316.97 billion in 2024 to USD 1054.19 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 16.2% over the forecast period. Asia Pacific dominated the low cost carrier market with a market share of 38.73% in 2023.\n\nA low-cost airline is an airline that does not offer the traditional services usually included in the ticket price, thus offering lower fares but less comfort. Low-cost airlines have a lower operating cost structure than other airlines. These companies offer discounted tickets to passengers but compensate for the loss by charging extra for food, priority boarding, seat assignment, and baggage. In addition, many low-cost airlines have only one aircraft type in their fleet, reducing the required crew training. For price reasons, some aircrafts land at small airports in crowded cities rather than the busiest ones.\n\nLow-cost airlines have grown exponentially globally in recent years due to increased economic activities, ease of travel, growth of the tourism industry, rapid urban commoditization, changing lifestyles, and consumer preferences for low-cost and non-aviation services. Similarly, due to an increase in last-minute bookings and uncertainty surrounding international travel, low cost carriers (LCC) offers customers more flexibility in canceling and changing their trips. Such factors are anticipated to contribute to the low cost carrier market growth during the forecast period. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the market growth decreased by 35.20% in 2020 compared to 2019. According to ACI, post-COVID-19, passenger trips decreased by about 59% compared to 2019.\n\nLow Cost Carrier Market Trends\n\nAirlines Adopting Point-to-Point Model is the Latest Trend in the Market\n\nPoint-to-point networks connect directly to a set of locations without disrupting service, even if the route is not direct. The star network connects each location through a single intermediate site called the hub. The point-to-point business model in the airline industry refers to a system where airlines fly passengers directly between specific city pairs without intermediary stops or hubs. The point-to-point models aim to reduce travel time, increase convenience, and often result in more competitive pricing due to lower operational costs.\n\nLow cost airlines are adopting this model owing to various factors such as efficiency, cost savings, simplified operations, direct demand, fare structure, quick turnaround, and others. Furthermore, this model allows airlines to serve a broader range of destinations. While other carriers might concentrate their services around major hubs, LCCs can connect secondary and regional airports, tapping into other markets. Another aspect of this model is the ease of scheduling networks or routes based on seasonal demand or emerging trends without adjusting their fleets. Such factors are the reason for the high adoption rate amongst airlines and is an emerging trend.\n\nRequest a Free sample to learn more about this report.\n\nLow Cost Carrier Market Growth Factors\n\nLow Maintenance Costs Associated with Aircrafts Drives Market Growth\n\nThe low maintenance cost associated with aircraft operated by low cost carriers plays a significant role in driving the market growth. Modern aircrafts used by LCCs are designed for quick turnaround times. This means they spend less time on the ground between flights, resulting in higher aircraft utilization and revenue generation. Reduced downtime also means low maintenance cost of the aircrafts and increased operational use.\n\nLCC typically operates many standard aircraft types, allowing them to negotiate favorable terms with aircraft manufacturers and maintenance providers. In May 2023, Malaysia's MYAirline signed an auxiliary power supply (APU) maintenance contract with Honeywell for its fleet of 22 Airbus A320s. Honeywell will help MYAirline reduce flight delays and cancellations through annual maintenance cost planning and predictive trend-tracking programs.\n\nIn September 2022, GA Telesis Engine Services (GATES), a global jet engine maintenance supplier, and Lion Air entered into a long-term engine maintenance agreement. Lion Air, the largest airline in Indonesia and the second-largest low-cost airline in Southeast Asia, has signed an agreement to supply its fleet of Boeing 737NG aircraft.\n\nRising Air Passenger Travel Owing to Reduced Fares to Drive Market Growth\n\nThe affordability of low cost carriers attracts a wide range of travelers. Reduced fares make air travel accessible to various air passenger classes. Air travel has gained popularity as the industry offers more flights and lower fares after deregulation. Fares are now the main competitive factor of airlines. Increased efficiency, better utilization of LCC fleets, and reduced costs allow them to offer significant discounts on airfares.\n\nMost customers want to reach their destination quickly and inexpensively and will waive inflight food and entertainment to save money. This desire to save money also extends to business travelers as companies increasingly focus on reducing travel bills. Widespread adoption of ticketless travel and internet-based delivery has benefited LCCs. This reduces the need for complex and expensive ticketing systems traditional airlines use to manage their complex fare structures. The cost per available seat in kilometers is USD 6.16 for a full-service carrier, and that of LCC is USD 3.07. Such factors contribute to the rise in air passenger demand and drive the LCC market.\n\nRESTRAINING FACTORS\n\nThin Profit Margin Owing to Intense Competition to Hinder Market Growth\n\nLow-cost airlines rely heavily on secondary revenue to make a profit. Cheap airfares are sometimes non-profitable for the airline. Due to this, airlines are exploring options to monetize ancillary sources, including revenue from checked baggage, in-flight snacks, and pre-sale seats. Many airlines, such as GoAir, Jet Airways, Air Sahara, Kingfisher Airlines, and others, file for bankruptcy due to the high overhead expense. Other factors that result in thin profit margins are limited networks, high infrastructure costs, high fuel costs, restrictive air service agreements (ASAs), and others.\n\nMoreover, there is high competition in this market for fares, on-time arrivals and departures, service offered, routes covered, and others. Many airline operators incur losses to give discounted fares and services to retain a competitive edge in the market. Such factors are a major restraining factor for the market growth.\n\nLow Cost Carrier Market Segmentation Analysis\n\nBy Aircraft Type Analysis\n\nWide Body Segment Dominates the Market Owing to the Increased Fleet Size by LCC Operators\n\nBy aircraft type, the market is segmented into narrow body, wide body, and others. The wide body segment is the dominating and fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. The segment's growth is due to the fleet expansion done by LCC operators. Center for Aviation and Official Airline Guide (OAG) showed that LCCs across the globe were operating just 133 wide body aircraft as of July 1, 2023.\n\nThe narrow body segment is anticipated to grow significantly during the forecast period. Technical advancements in narrow body have increased their capabilities for flying longer distances, such as Boeing B737 and Airbus A320. Such factors drive the growth of the segment during the forecast period.\n\nTo know how our report can help streamline your business, Speak to Analyst\n\nBy Destination Analysis\n\nInternational Segment Dominates the Market Owing to the Rising Number of Routes\n\nBased on destination, the market is divided into domestic and international. The international segment dominates this market owing to the growing number of international routes from airline operators to expand their business. In July 2023, FlyArystan, Kazakhstan's leading low cost airline, expanded its international operations with flight routes to China. For the first time, the LCC will connect Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, with Urumqi in China's Xinjiang region.\n\nDomestic is anticipated to be the fastest-growing segment due to increased air passenger travel in LCC due to reduced airfare, standard aircrafts, point-to-point routes, and others. Business travelers can switch to traditional airlines and premium cabins for more affordable alternatives for domestic destinations, allowing low-cost carriers to remain entrenched in the travel market amid increased tourism across countries such as the U.S., U.K., India, and others. For instance,\n\nIn January 2024, Indigo announced six new domestic routes; the airline will be operating direct flights from Ahmedabad to Rajkot, Ahmedabad to Aurangabad, Bhopal to Lucknow, and Indore to Varanasi. The airline has also announced direct flights between Kolkata-Srinagar and Kolkata-Jammu from April 10, 2024 and April 21, 2024.\n\nBy Haul Analysis\n\nLong Haul Segment Dominated the Market Owing to Low Priced Business Models\n\nBy haul, the market is bifurcated into long haul and short haul. The long haul segment dominated the market in 2023. Long haul destinations are highly attractive amongst air travelers owing to the low price range and single-route flights. With the rise in demand, various LCC operators are increasing long haul routes. Owing to this, the segment is also anticipated to be the fastest-growing during the forecast period.\n\nThe short haul segment is projected to show significant growth during the study period. The rise in corporate travel with scheduled routes and low prices is a major factor in the segment's growth.\n\nREGIONAL INSIGHTS\n\nGeographically, the market is divided into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America.\n\nAsia Pacific Low Cost Carrier Market Size, 2023 (USD Billion)\n\nTo get more information on the regional analysis of this market, Request a Free sample\n\nAsia Pacific held the largest market share in 2023. The region was valued at USD 104.73 billion in the year 2023. The regional growth is due to the improved low cost carrier network to promote untapped routes and intra-regional travel.
