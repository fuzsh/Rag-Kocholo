        "text": "As one of the largest cities in the U.S., Dallas offers a little bit of everything with a side of Southern hospitality. First-time visitors will naturally realize that things in Texas are just plain bigger. Explore pockets of preserved history, clap your hands to new musical sounds, and make room for big bites of Tex-Mex staples.\n\nStart your trip by getting to know the local flora and fauna. Take a trip to the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, a 66-acre garden on the southeastern shore of White Rock Lake. Experience the peace and calm that this vast arboretum provides and squeeze in a trip to the lake if your schedule allows. Bikers and runners can take on the lake’s nine-mile circumference for a spectacular view. After seeing the city up close, catch a bird’s eye view of the city from Reunion Tower. This 561-foot observation tower is one of Dallas’s most recognizable landmarks, offering visitors the chance to fall in love with this big city from high up.\n\nFor creative inspiration, consider getting acquainted with the local art scene. Take a trip to Bishop Arts District, a retreat from fast-paced city life, and explore the area’s popular restaurants and art galleries. Art enthusiasts will relish the Dallas Museum of Art, one of the largest in the country. With over 25,000 works to explore, you’ll have plenty to keep you engaged. Of course, feasting your eyes often leads to a desire to satisfy your other senses. Be sure to make room for fantastic live blues performances, a genre considered the heart and soul of Dallas."
