        "text": "Southwest Airlines snatched up more land near Dallas Love Field as 2019 ended, continuing the company’s expansion near its corporate headquarters.\n\nDallas-based Southwest bought 3 acres along with an office building at 9080 Harry Hines Blvd. from Arizona real estate investment firm Spirit Master Funding. The newly purchased property is immediately next to Southwest’s growing corporate campus. A selling price on the property was not available, but county appraisal records valued it at just over $8 million.\n\nA Southwest Airlines spokesman was not able to give more details on Southwest’s intentions for the property Thursday.\n\nSouthwest has been expanding aggressively in the area with training and operations buildings for the company’s 62,000 employees, including 10,000 in Dallas.\n\nIn October, the company announced plans to build a 141,000-square-foot facility for pilot training that should be completed in fall. That will give it more pilot briefing and training rooms as well as space for eight more flight simulators, bringing its total to 18.\n\nIn 2018, Southwest finished a $250 million, 414,000-square-foot facility called the “Wings” building that houses 2,200 employees and includes flight operations, training, regulatory, compliance, technology and other offices. That building is connected to Southwest’s “Leads” building, another corporate office. Also on that piece of property is Southwest’s flight attendant training facility, known as “Tops.\"\n\nSouthwest’s corporate buildings are on two adjacent pieces of land. The corporate headquarters and maintenance base are on a piece of property owned by Dallas Love Field and the city of Dallas. The second part is privately owned by the airline and is south of Denton Drive and north of Harry Hines Boulevard.\n\nThe 3-acre property Southwest bought this week contains a 36,750-square-foot office building and was formerly part of the Pine Creek Medical Center campus. The building shares a parking lot and is connected by a breezeway to the medical center, a doctor-owned hospital that settled a kickback scheme with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2017 for $7.5 million. Both the office building and the hospital are vacant.\n\n———\n\n©2020 The Dallas Morning News\n\nVisit The Dallas Morning News at www.dallasnews.com"
