        "text": "Folks, don't forget that we have an extremely comfortable iOS application in App Store\n\nPlease try it!\n\nWhat is a low-cost airline?\n\nA low-cost carrier (LCC) is an airline that offers services at minimal fares and with minimal complimentary services. The first successful company known as a low-cost carrier was the American Pacific Southwest Airlines. The historic flight of the first flight with ticket prices several times cheaper than competitors took place on May 6, 1947.\n\nIn the European market, the first budget airlines were Irish Ryanair and British EasyJet, founded in the 1990s. Their rapid growth was associated with the creation of the EU and the subsequent deregulation of European airspace – airlines were granted the right to fly between EU countries without the need for special permits, and they took off.\n\nOver the past 10 years, more than 100 new airlines have emerged worldwide, starting flights based on low-cost principles, and the share of passengers traveling with low-cost carriers has grown from 13% to 29% of the total global passenger flow. Many traditional airlines, under the pressure of competition, have also changed their business models, transforming into discount airlines. For example, UIA introduced low-cost tariffs since 2017.\n\nIn 2018, after analyzing reviews from travelers worldwide, the Skytrax organization named Air Asia from Malaysia the best budget airline in the world. Norwegian Air, a Norwegian carrier, came in second place, followed by American JetBlue in third, and they are followed by British EasyJet and Virgin America from the USA.\n\nLOW-COST AIRLINES BUSINESS MODEL\n\nThe main low-cost model implies the following:\n\n1. Abandonment of traditional onboard services\n\nLow-cost carriers do not have cabin class divisions, instead, they have a more compact cabin layout (non-reclining, narrower seats, less distance between seat backs), ultimately allowing for more passengers on board. Paid meals, baggage allowance, and seat selection are common practices.\n\n2. Route network optimization: high-frequency point-to-point routes and reduction of downtime. Low-cost companies primarily focus on short and medium distances – typically up to 2000 km.\n\n3. Fleet standardization – airlines utilize aircraft of a single model with a single class of service (without business and premium economy classes). This helps to save on the maintenance staff. Additionally, airlines aim to use aircraft not older than 10 years to save money on maintenance.\n\nFor example, Ryanair only uses Boeing 737, while Wizz Air operates Airbus A320 and A321. New aircraft will be more expensive, but with active turnover, maintenance will be much cheaper. Moreover, when ordering large batches of aircraft, the airline receives a good discount from the manufacturer, and after several years of use, the aircraft can still be sold at a good price.\n\nThe average age of aircraft in low-cost carriers is significantly below the market average (13 years).\n\nFor Norwegian Air, it's 4 years.\n\nFlyDubai, Air Arabia, Pegasus, and Wizz Air – 5 years.\n\nRyanair – 7 years.\n\nVueling, EasyJet, Transavia – 8 years.\n\nFor comparison, Lufthansa – 12 years, British Airways – 14, Turkish Airlines – 8, Qatar Airways – 6, KLM – 9, Emirates – 6, LOT – 8, UIA – 13.\n\nThe optimal age range for aircraft usage is up to 15 years.\n\n4. Utilization of secondary airports.\n\nSince traditional tickets include the cost of airport fees, often quite high, the use of secondary airports allows for reducing this cost item, and the turnaround time at the airport is also reduced.\n\nThe turnaround time for a budget airline is 25 minutes. The less time the aircraft spends on the ground, the fewer expenses it incurs. Sometimes you can observe passengers boarding through one door while arriving passengers are still disembarking through another door – this is a vivid example of saving turnaround time.\n\n5. \"As little baggage as possible on board\" approach not only reduces the takeoff weight of the aircraft, resulting in lower fuel consumption, but also reduces the time for aircraft servicing on the ground. Ryanair's non-reclining seats and absence of seat-back pockets also save time on cabin cleaning. Together, this allows airlines to ensure quick aircraft turnaround on the ground. For example, Wizz Air and Ryanair aircraft typically operate an average of 5 flights per day.\n\n6. Staff trained to perform multiple roles.\n\nIn some airlines, for example, flight attendants also check boarding passes upon boarding. Pilots may be hired through intermediaries (similar to individual entrepreneurs in Ukrainian terms) to save on sick leave, vacation, and insurance payments. Salaries for pilots and cabin crew are not the highest, which often leads to strikes resulting in flight cancellations. Therefore, high service standards on board are not always achievable.\n\nSAFETY\n\nLow-cost carriers use relatively new aircraft and maintain them well. According to statistics, the three largest European low-cost carriers, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and EasyJet, have never experienced a major aviation incident (with casualties) throughout their history. Overall, ordinary incidents occur three times less frequently than the average for all aircraft worldwide and 20% less frequently than the average for aircraft aged 0-5 years. Therefore, safety can be considered one of the main advantages of low-cost carriers alongside price.\n\nPRICING IN LOW-COST CARRIERS. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO BUY TICKETS?\n\nThe ticket prices for low-cost carriers on a specific route have a much wider range than those of regular airlines. It depends on the time before departure, demand, and competition on the route. Unlike regular airlines, low-cost carriers rarely offer cheap tickets more than 3 months before departure. This is due to the desire to maintain flexibility in planning the route network over a long period. Cancelling a flight with 5 sold tickets is much easier than cancelling a flight with 50 sold tickets, so they stimulate demand only 3 months before departure when the flight schedule is more stabilized.\n\nThe cheapest tickets are usually sold 45-90 days before departure. However, it cannot be said that buying a ticket on the last day will definitely cost you a fortune. The price will depend on the demand for the specific flight. Note! Tickets purchased at the lowest fare from low-cost airlines are non-refundable or exchangeable.\n\nWHAT SHOULD YOU PAY EXTRA FOR?\n\nYou may be charged for airport check-in and boarding pass printing (if you did not check in online).\n\nBaggage. If you are sure you need baggage, arrange it immediately when booking, as the cost of checked baggage at the airport may increase several times and be more expensive than the ticket itself.\n\nExtra cabin luggage\n\nOption for ticket refund or changes\n\nMeal\n\nSeat selection\n\nPriority boarding\n\nNote! Low-cost carriers do not provide automatic baggage transfer to the airline operating the next flight on your ticket, even if it is the same airline. If your ticket includes multiple flights from low-cost carriers or combines flights from a low-cost carrier and a regular airline, you will need to collect your baggage and check it in again for the next flight at each transfer point.\n\nFLIGHT CANCELLATIONS. HOW OFTEN AND WHY DO THEY HAPPEN? WHAT TO DO IF YOUR FLIGHT IS CANCELLED?\n\nOn average, about 1% of flights are cancelled across the market, and low-cost carriers also generally adhere to this figure. Moreover, over the last 3 months of 2018, major European airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines had a higher percentage of cancellations compared to low-cost carriers.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be said that flight cancellations are specifically a problem of low-cost carriers. The essence lies deeper – in the consequences of cancellations. Since low-cost carriers do not guarantee connections, if one flight in a connecting route is cancelled, your entire journey may be at risk. Whereas regular airlines, in case of cancellation of one segment, offer a convenient replacement for the entire route.\n\nThe reasons for cancellations can vary – weather conditions, airport closure, aircraft malfunction, cancellation of the entire route, staff strikes. In case of cancellation, the airline (even low-cost carriers) must provide you with a ticket for the same destination on other dates or compensate the ticket cost if the offered option does not suit you.\n\nTRANSIT FLIGHT. DO I NEED A VISA?\n\nVisa requirements largely depend on the specific country and airport, but since low-cost carriers sell only direct flights and do not guarantee connections, each of your flights will be considered separately. In case of absence or closure of the transit zone at the airport for transfer, you will have to go through passport control upon exit and go through it again for boarding.\n\nIf you do not have a visa for the country where you plan to transit between low-cost carrier flights, you are unlikely to be allowed to board the first flight. For example, at Boryspil Airport, passengers on Ryanair flights to London are not allowed to board without a British transit visa, regardless of having tickets for further flights.\n\nTherefore, you need to be careful when purchasing flights with low-cost carriers through British airports such as Luton and Stansted – since there is no transit zone, you will have to go through passport control to continue your journey. Consequently, for flights via London on Ryanair or Wizz Air, a British visa is mandatory. Read more about transit in London in this article.\n\nIS IT TRUE THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE A SEAT ON A LOW-COST CARRIER LIKE IN A MINIBUS?\n\nThis practice existed before. The reason for this, besides motivating passengers to pay for seat selection, was to encourage passengers to board more quickly, avoid delays in the terminal, and prevent departure delays. However, this led to disorder during boarding and a large number of complaints, especially from families with children. Therefore, now, for example, with Wizz Air and Ryanair, seats are assigned at the time of flight check-in.\n\nRULES FOR BUYING LOW-COST TICKETS\n\nMake sure you can fly – tickets are non-refundable, unless you want to change the dates, but for an additional fee.\n\nBuy tickets 45-90 days before departure.\n\nCheck in online to avoid the cost of printing your boarding pass.\n\nTake as few items as possible, and also make sure to measure your luggage just in case. If your backpack/bag looks suspiciously large, you won't avoid additional charges. Read all about carry-on requirements for popular airlines in this article.\n\nChoose your seat, purchase meals, and baggage during the ticket purchase process – it's cheaper that way.\n\n8 POPULAR LOW-COST CARRIERS\n\nAir Asia\n\nThe most popular Asian low-cost carrier, which has been recognized as the best low-cost carrier in the world by Skytrax for 8 years in a row. The Malaysian airline operates on the principle of \"Now Everyone Can Fly,\" and this seems to be true because Air Asia offers over 400 routes to 25 countries. Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and others.\n\nCarry-on luggage: one bag with dimensions of 56*36*23 cm, weight not exceeding 7 kg.\n\nNorwegian\n\nThe third largest low-cost airline in Europe. Norwegian offers an impressive network of routes between cities in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and various cities in Northern and Southern Europe. Be prepared that there won't be super-budget flights here, as we all know that Scandinavian countries are quite expensive. However, you should be pleased with the free Wi-Fi on almost all flights and carry-on baggage allowances, which are much more pleasant than those of Ryanair.\n\nCarry-on baggage: one piece up to 10 kg with dimensions of 55x40x23 cm.\n\nEasy Jet\n\nEasyJet — a British low-cost airline, operating since 1995, flying to more than 300 destinations in 30 countries. Every year, over 50 million passengers use its services. The company's website has an interesting section: \"Travel Ideas\" (almost the same as the familiar \"Fare Finder\" from Ryanair). You will see a map with the nearest airport from you. You just need to choose your wish list (where to fly) and the approximate ticket price that suits you. Unfortunately, this feature does not work for departures from Ukraine as low-cost airlines are not yet represented in Ukraine, but it is useful for departures from Poland and other European countries.\n\nCarry-on baggage: one bag with dimensions of 56x45x25 cm, without weight restrictions.\n\nFlyDubai\n\nYes, indeed, there are low-cost airlines in the UAE too! The main hub of FlyDubai is located in Dubai, and the carrier flies to Europe, Africa, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nCarry-on baggage: your baggage can measure up to 55*38*20 cm and weigh up to 8 kg.\n\nVueling Airlines\n\nVueling Airlines – a Spanish low-cost carrier, one of the largest in Europe. Every year, the budget airline transports over 24 million passengers. It operates flights to 38 countries in Europe and North Africa.\n\nCarry-on baggage: your baggage can measure up to 55*40*20 cm and weigh up to 8 kg.\n\nJetstar Airways\n\nJetstar Airways – a budget Australian airline, with its main base at Melbourne Airport. It flies to more than 19 destinations across the Green Continent, as well as to Malaysia, China, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and even the USA. Soon, the low-cost carrier promises to appear in airports in Italy, Greece, and Germany. So, the opportunity for Ukrainians to see the Land Down Under is getting closer.\n\nCarry-on baggage: baggage weight up to 7 kg, considering the size of 56*36*23 cm."
