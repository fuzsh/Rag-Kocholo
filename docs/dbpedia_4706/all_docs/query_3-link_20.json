        "text": "Building strong customer relations has been a key factor in the success of Southwest Airlines,so when the 40-year-old global company set out to redesign its corporate headquarters,communications were a high priority. The extensive renovation encompassed several key areasof the Southwest Airlines facility in Dallas, Texas, including the Executive Boardroom, Freedom Hall, The Landing, and a matrix of training rooms—all configured and controlled by MediaMatrix® NION® distributed digital audio systems.\n\nMeasuring 60 feet by 30 feet, the Executive Boardroom is the primary meeting location forthe company’s executive team. Beneath its visual amenities such as digital projection andplasma displays is a MediaMatrix NION-based audio system programmed to mix and amplifyspeech so that the farther away a speaker moves from the audience, the more of that person’svoice comes out of the speakers. Such a sophisticated design guarantees speech clarity and intelligibility.\n\nFreedom Hall serves as the main hub of internal and external communications, with a mix of applications ranging from web-streamed employee meetings to press conferences with full media support. MediaMatrix NION configures and controls the room’s audio system, including 60 push-to-talk microphones.\n\nA network of seven presentation and training rooms can be used separately or joined, and can also serve as overflow seating for Freedom Hall—even though they are not located adjacent to each other. MediaMatrix can virtually combine or separate the rooms’ audio systems, allowing Southwest’s team to achieve multiple purposes.\n\nMediaMatrix NION is also the audio centerpiece of The Landing, a common area that overlooks the Dallas Love Field runway. This large, open space is used as a cafeteria, a reception area for flight attendant graduations, and other large functions."
