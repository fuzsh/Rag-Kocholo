They were faced with battles due to legal issues with Dallas and Love field, because of the Wright Amendment, but the come to an agreement to allow 4 states to connect to Texas. Southwest bought 129 new planes, because of the expansion of the company growth, which currently have 141 planes that enhance the growth of the company because of shorter flights (Gimbel, 2005). Southwest was started in 1971, by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher, which released it first flight from Dallas Love Field that is located in Houston and San Antonio Texas. The passengers look for an airline services that can get them to their destination at a cheap price. Majority of the passenger are looking for an airline service that will eliminate layovers and multiple stops as possible.\n\nBack in March of 1967, Southwest Airlines was first founded under a different name, Air Southwest Company, by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher . With his own funds of $500 thousand, Kelleher filed an application with the Texas Aeronautics Commission for the right to fly commercial airplanes in the state of Texas. In February 20th of 1968, the Texas Aeronautics Commission voted unanimously, granting Air Southwest a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The following day, Braniff, Trans Texas (later known as Texas International), and Continental Airlines obtained a restraining order from Travis County District, prohibiting the certificate to be delivered to Air Southwest Company . Air Southwest Company tried to file appeal with the Austin State District Court and the Third Court of Civil Appeals. Both courts ruled against Air Southwest, forcing Herb Kelleher to appeal with the Texas Supreme Court. The Texas Supreme Court unanimously voted to overturn the lower court’s decisions and ruled in favor of Air Southwest . In December of 1970, the United States Supreme Court denied the appeal by Braniff and Texas International to remove Air Southwest certification . In 1983, Winifred Barnum, a children’s author and illustrator, wrote a children’s book based on Southwest’s legal fight called Gumwrappers and Goggle. In Jan 1st of 1971, Lamar Muse joined Air Southwest as the President. In March of 1971, Lamar Muse raised $1.25 million for the company by selling promissory\n\nSouthwest Airlines is a major US airline established in 1967 that services a multitude of cities in all 50 states and beyond. The company is known for its outstanding quality in providing services and it 's cost effective ticket prices to its many passengers throughout the nation. This airline is based in the southwestern United States, in the city of Dallas Texas, and due to the tremendous number of airplanes that it has and the timely service that it provides to its passengers, this airline services more US passengers than any other airline. This airline also has the largest fleet of planes of any economical or low-cost airline service in the world and employees more than 45,000.\n\nSouthwest airlines began in 1967 as Air Southwest Co. Based in Dallas. They began serving three major cities in Texas, with only three Boeing 737 aircrafts. March 29th, 1971 Air Southwest Co. changed its name to Southwest Airlines Co. The company began service on June 18, 1971 from Love Field in Dallas to Houston and San Antonio. Founders Rollin King and Herb Kelleher were inspired by their location to create an airline that was focused on the people. The LUV airline prides itself with exceptional employees and “no frill” customer service. CEO, Gary Kelly states, “After all, we like to say that we are not a Company of planes; we are a Company of People.” Southwest is known to value their employees just as equally as their customers.\n\nIn 1972 all Houston service is transferred to Houston's Hobby Airport form Houston Intercontinental, that is make more convenient for people to fly. During the first year of operations the customers were the Southwest's first priority. Five years after the first operated a twin-engine the SWA places its sixth Boeing 737 into service while flying over one and a half million satisfied customers to their destinations. Also at the same year SWA gets\n\nSouthwest Airlines is a passenger airline company that arranges and provides scheduled flights for passenger and transportation freight services. The company mainly provides, low-fare, point-to-point services all over the US and near-international markets. The headquarters is located in Dallas, Texas and as of December 2014, the company employed over 46,278 people. The company was founded by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher in 1971. Southwest was the first airline to introduce the frequent mile program. This took place in the mid 1980’s. This type of program allowed passengers to add up traveled miles to use later as credit on a future airline ticket. The traveled miles would add up and would also reduce the price of a ticket. Southwest created the idea of senior discount, fun fares and the fun packs. These were perks that attracted people from different age groups. When Southwest originally was incorporated, the idea was to operate in three cities in Texas, but after taking over Morris Air and TranStar in 1987, this gave them a cutting advantage in the airline industry.\n\nSouthwest Airlines was formed in 1967 by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher and started service in June of 1971. The airline is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and originally operated flights within the state of Texas. The company has since expanded and now operates flights from Dallas to almost all major cities in the United States and is considered the largest low-cost carrier in the country. “Southwest seeks to offer a travel product that is built around flights targeted to specific demographics and ticket pricing that is simplified so that passengers know\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co., established in 1971 by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher, began its operations with only three Boeing 737 aircrafts. It is headquartered in Dallas, Texas(Hawkins, Misra, & Tang, 2012). Southwest is well known as one of the largest low-cost carriers. With this strategy, the company has dramatically grown up and deeply rooted in the US airline industry. Now, Southwest Airlines Co. operates 633 aircrafts to 93 domestic cities and the highest number of passengers used Southwest Airlines to fly around U.S in Jan 2014 (Hawkins, Misra, & Tang, 2012). To accomplish more than 40th consecutive years of both profitability and competitiveness, Southwest Airlines Company is constantly trying to find the routes to differentiate itself from other domestic carriers (Hawkins, Misra, & Tang, 2012).\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co. began its operations in 1971 and has been serving the industry for the past 43 years now (Southwest Airlines, n.d.). It is the major domestic airline, and ranked number one in 2014 by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (United States Department of Transportation, 2014). Back in 1971 the airline began its services in Texas in the cities of Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas. The company has been ranked as the nation's largest low cost carrier (Mergent, 2012). It offers the lowest fares, and has the lowest cost structure in the industry.\n\nSouthwest airlines began in 1971 using a strategy unlike any other airline at the time. Starting out in Texas, with only three planes, they flew between the Texas cities of Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio (Coulter, pg 250). Their primary goal was to get their passengers to their destinations, on time, at the lowest possible fares, and to provide a fun atmosphere for their customers. They focused on providing short-haul routes with fares that were competitive with driving. Today, Southwest serves 101 destinations across the United States, as well as eight additional countries, and operates more than 3,900 flights a day. (Southwest , 2017) They have achieved a record 44 consecutive years of annual profitability, while staying true to their goal of providing the highest level of customer service at the lowest fare. In 2016 they ranked number 1 in customer satisfaction according to statistics listed by the Department of Transportation, with and average passenger airfare of $149.09 one way trip. (Southwest , 2017)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (SWA) maintained a low-cost, low-price and no frills strategy. The small Texas carrier began as a concept, its business plan detailed on a cocktail napkin in 1971 and grew into the nation’s fourth largest airline. Known as an innovator with low operating costs, dominating smaller airports, with a humorous customer service, SWA saw its 40th profitable year in 2013. Like all companies, SWA underwent leadership changes in 2001, and said goodbye to the company’s founder in 2008. Unfortunately, the changes in leadership were not the only changes; the organization proceeded to alter their beliefs and activities.\n\nSouthwest wanted to stress the importance of low operating costs. To do this they implemented many strategies. They operated only one type of jetBoeing 737s. This minimized their spare part inventories, cost them less to train maintenance and repair personnel. They were also the launch customer for Boeing 's 737-300, 737-500, and the 737-700 jets, and this enabled them to receive a big discount. They incorporated ticketless travel and save the\n\nSouthwest Airline was from an idea on a napkin between Rollin King and Herb Kelleher. Eventually, after a few regulation issues, the airline became official on focusing point-to-point travel between Dallas, Houston, San Antonio. One of the early key success factors which stated in the case, “ In contrast to larger airlines servicing the cities through connecting interstate routes, Southwest would fly directly to each of the cities, and the flights would take roughly one hour each.” Not only Southwest has the advantage of time but also the trust on safety from frequent flyers by having a direct flight to each city. Likewise, within two years (1971-1973) due to price segmentation based on the time of before and after 7 PM along with weekends, the company became profitable.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Company (Southwest Airlines or ‘the Company’ SWA) is a passenger airline that provides scheduled passenger and freight transportation services. The Company primarily provides scheduled services throughout the US and near-international markets. It is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and employs 48,000 people and serves over one hundred million customers annually (“Southwest,” 2015). Southwest Airlines has accumulated over forty years of revenue and is one of the supremely flown airlines in the United States of America (Dess, et al, 2014, p. C137). Recognized for dominating the national or domestic airline market, Southwest Airlines’ diligence has built an"
