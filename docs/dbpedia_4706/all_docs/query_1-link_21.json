        "text": "Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A said: “We sincerely thank Skytrax and the travellers who voted for us for recognising our efforts to deliver best-in-class quality and excellence for the 15th consecutive year. No other companies come to my mind in achieving such a winning streak, and we are very proud of it. We dedicate this award to all of our Allstars who work tirelessly to make today happen, and also to everyone who has remained loyal to us through the ups and downs AirAsia has experienced.”\n\nMr. Leslie Thng, CEO of Scoot said: “We are honoured and privileged to be recognised as the World’s Best Low-Cost Long-Haul Airline for the fourth consecutive year. This award affirms the dedication and hard work of the Scoot family, as we continue to innovate, expand our network, and improve the customer experience. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and partners, for their support all these years. In the coming years, we will continue to push boundaries and seize opportunities to maintain our position as the leading low-cost carrier in the region.”\n\n“We’re absolutely thrilled to receive our first-ever Skytrax Award! Winning the Best Low Cost Airline in Africa is a huge feat for our domestic airline that has been around for just shy of four years. This is a testament to the amazing service our team provides, but also serves as recognition of the broader business model. We are clearly making a mark by providing travellers with our elevated experience and industry leading flexibility. Thank you to our amazing travellers for this vote of confidence”, says Jonathan Ayache, LIFT CEO.\n\nCarlos Muñoz, CEO of Volotea said: \"We are very happy to receive this recognition from Skytrax, again this year. Since we started Volotea in 2012, we have focused on providing our passengers with a great flight experience, always with very competitive prices, and we've done that now for over 60 million travelers across Europe. This award goes to our entire team, especially our very professional and very friendly crews, for their incredible effort and dedication. And of course, a big thank you to our passengers and to Skytrax for this honor.”\n\nBander Almohanna, CEO of flynas, said: “Keeping our top position in the low-cost airline in the Middle East demonstrates that flynas is growing and expanding in style to be the largest LCC in the MENA region, according to the company vision. Rising so high in the aviation industry was made possible only through the hard work of our team, the enduring loyalty of our guests, and the backing of our partners and stakeholders in the Kingdom.”\n\nRichard Ledger, Acting CEO of FlyArystan said: “We are delighted to again be recognized as the best low-cost carrier in Central Asia and CIS. Our focus on safety, operation standards, product innovation and customer satisfaction, run in parallel to our commitment to deliver the best fares in the market. We continue to transform the aviation landscape in Kazakhstan and across the region. I thank our staff for their dedication, and our customers for their loyalty.”\n\n“We are incredibly honored and proud to receive this award as it recognizes our unwavering dedication to our customers,” said Allegiant President Gregory C. Anderson. “Our team members are the foundation of what we do – they continue to ensure safety, reliability and impeccable service onboard. As a leisure focused airline, our unique business model bridges the gap in connecting small-to-medium sized cities to premier vacation destinations. This accolade reaffirms the important value we bring to the communities we serve and acknowledges our long history of providing great service at an attractive price for our customers.”\n\n\"We are proud to be recognized for the fourth time as the best low cost airline in Latin America by Skytrax. This award is very special as it reflects the opinion of our own passengers at a time when we have had significant growth, with presence in 9 countries in the Americas, and motivates us to continue improving our value proposition. This year, for example, we launched our loyalty program with which we offer our passengers various benefits for flying with us. We will continue working to become the airline of choice in Latin America,\" said Holger Paulmann."
