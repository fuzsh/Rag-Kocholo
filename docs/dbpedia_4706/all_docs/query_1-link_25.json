        "text": "What are Southwest’s busiest airports and routes?\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ON THE FLY\n\nSouthwest, the world’s largest low-cost carrier, had a rough holiday season operationally. But now with that behind it, its mission is to win back customers and work to ensure more resiliency and reliability for the future.\n\nFortunately, Southwest still has many formidable strengths, including its expansive domestic flight network, supplemented by routes to nearby vacation spots in Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\nBut what are Southwest’s busiest airports and routes? Let’s take a closer look at Southwest’s impressive network for the upcoming April-to-June quarter, typically its strongest financially.\n\nAccording to Diio by Cirium, Denver will be the airline’s busiest airport measured by total seats scheduled. That’s after growing Denver’s seat capacity by 35% versus the spring quarter of 2019. Indeed, Denver is becoming more and more important to the Southwest network.\n\nAs you can see from the list below, Las Vegas, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington (BWI) and Dallas Love Field round out the carrier’s top five airports. It is also important to note the importance of California to Southwest’s network.\n\nNever miss an on the fly story. Sign-up to receive an email notice when a new story is published."
