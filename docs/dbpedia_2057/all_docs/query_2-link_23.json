        "meta_description": "Abstract. The CryoGrid community model is a flexible toolbox for simulating the ground thermal regime and the iceâwater balance for permafrost and glaciers, extending a well-established suite of permafrost models (CryoGridÂ  1, 2, and 3). The CryoGrid community model can accommodate a wide variety of application scenarios, which is achieved by fully modular structures through object-oriented programming. Different model components, characterized by their process representations and parameterizations, are realized as classes (i.e., objects) in CryoGrid. Standardized communication protocols between these classes ensure that they can be stacked vertically. For example, the CryoGrid community model features several classes with different complexity for the seasonal snow cover, which can be flexibly combined with a range of classes representing subsurface materials, each with their own set of process representations (e.g., soil with and without water balance, glacier ice). We present the CryoGrid architecture as well as the model physics and defining equations for the different model classes, focusing on one-dimensional model configurations which can also interact with external heat and water reservoirs. We illustrate the wide variety of simulation capabilities for a site on Svalbard, with point-scale permafrost simulations using, e.g., different soil freezing characteristics, drainage regimes, and snow representations, as well as simulations for glacier mass balance and a shallow water body. The CryoGrid community model is not intended as a static model framework but aims to provide developers with a flexible platform for efficient model development. In this study, we document both basic and advanced model functionalities to provide a baseline for the future development of novel cryosphere models.",

Grazed sites generally have a larger annual ground surface temperature amplitude than ungrazed sites, but the net effect depends on effects in the transitional seasons. Our results also suggest that seasonal use of pastures can reduce ground temperatures, which can be a strategy to protect currently degrading grassland permafrost.\n\nSpatio-temporal snow data assimilation with the ICESat-2 laser altimeter\n\nMarco Mazzolini, Kristoffer Aalstad, Esteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez, Sebastian Westermann, and DÃ©sirÃ©e Treichler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1404,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1404, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we use the satellite laser altimeter ICESat-2 to retrieve snow depth in areas where snow amounts are still poorly estimated despite the high societal importance. We explore how to update snow models with these observations through algorithms that spatially propagate the information beyond the narrow satellite profiles. The positive results show the potential of this approach for improving snow simulations, both in terms of average snow depth and spatial distribution.\n\nCarbon degradation and mobilisation potentials of thawing permafrost peatlands in Northern Norway\n\nSigrid Trier KjÃ¦r, Sebastian Westermann, Nora Nedkvitne, and Peter DÃ¶rsch\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-562,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-562, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost peatlands are thawing due to climate change, releasing large quantities of carbon that degrades upon thawing and is released as CO2, CH4, or dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We incubated thawed Norwegian permafrost peat plateaus and thermokarst pond sediment found next to permafrost for up to 350 days to measure carbon loss. CO2 production was largest initially, while CH4 production increased over time. The largest carbon loss was measured at the top of the peat plateau core as DOC.\n\nThe evolution of Arctic permafrost over the last 3Â centuries from ensemble simulations with the CryoGridLite permafrost model\n\nMoritz Langer, Jan Nitzbon, Brian Groenke, Lisa-Marie Assmann, Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Simone Maria Stuenzi, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 363–385, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-363-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-363-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a model that can simulate the evolution of Arctic permafrost over centuries to millennia, we find that post-industrialization permafrost warming has three \"hotspots\" in NE Canada, N Alaska, and W Siberia. The extent of near-surface permafrost has decreased substantially since 1850, with the largest area losses occurring in the last 50 years. The simulations also show that volcanic eruptions have in some cases counteracted the loss of near-surface permafrost for a few decades.\n\nRapid warming and degradation of mountain permafrost in Norway and Iceland\n\nBernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Ketil Isaksen, Justyna Czekirda, Sebastian Westermann, Christin Hilbich, and Christian Hauck\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5477–5497, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5477-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost (permanently frozen ground) is widespread in the mountains of Norway and Iceland. Several boreholes were drilled after 1999 for long-term permafrost monitoring. We document a strong warming of permafrost, including the development of unfrozen bodies in the permafrost. Warming and degradation of mountain permafrost may lead to more natural hazards.\n\nSpatio-temporal information propagation using sparse observations in hyper-resolution ensemble-based snow data assimilation\n\nEsteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez, Kristoffer Aalstad, Norbert Pirk, Marco Mazzolini, DÃ©sirÃ©e Treichler, Paul Leclercq, Sebastian Westermann, Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno, and Simon Gascoin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4637–4659, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4637-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4637-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we explore how to improve hyper-resolution (5 m) distributed snowpack simulations using sparse observations, which do not provide information from all the areas of the simulation domain. We propose a new way of propagating information throughout the simulations adapted to the hyper-resolution, which could also be used to improve simulations of other nature. The method has been implemented in an open-source data assimilation tool that is readily accessible to everyone.\n\nDevelopment of multiple taliks near settlements on Svalbard – a new source of drinking water for the High Arctic?\n\nAnatoly O. Sinitsyn, Sara Bazin, Rasmus Benestad, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Ketil Isaksen, Hanne Kvitsand, Julia Lutz, Andrea L. Popp, Lena Rubensdotter, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2950,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2950, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study looked at under the ground on Svalbard, an archipelago close to the North Pole. We found something very surprising – there is water under the all year around frozen soil. This was not known before. This water could be used for drinking if we manage it carefully. This is important because getting clean drinking water is very difficult in Svalbard, and other Arctic places. Also, because the climate is getting warmer, there might be even more water underground in the future.\n\nRecent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes\n\nLÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Michele Magni, Fanny Brun, Joel Fiddes, Yanbin Lei, Philip Kraaijenbrink, Tamara Mathys, Moritz Langer, Simon Allen, and Walter W. Immerzeel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4409–4436, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAcross the Tibetan Plateau, many large lakes have been changing level during the last decades as a response to climate change. In high-mountain environments, water fluxes from the land to the lakes are linked to the ground temperature of the land and to the energy fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, which are modified by climate change. With a numerical model, we test how these water and energy fluxes have changed over the last decades and how they influence the lake level variations.\n\nSimulating ice segregation and thaw consolidation in permafrost environments with the CryoGrid community model\n\nJuditha Aga, Julia Boike, Moritz Langer, Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4179–4206, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4179-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4179-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a new model scheme for simulating ice segregation and thaw consolidation in permafrost environments, depending on ground properties and climatic forcing. It is embedded in the CryoGrid community model, a land surface model for the terrestrial cryosphere. We describe the model physics and functionalities, followed by a model validation and a sensitivity study of controlling factors.\n\nEstimating surface water availability in high mountain rock slopes using a numerical energy balance model\n\nMatan Ben-Asher, Florence Magnin, Sebastian Westermann, JosuÃ© Bock, Emmanuel Malet, Johan Berthet, Ludovic Ravanel, and Philip Deline\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 11, 899–915, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-899-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-899-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantitative knowledge of water availability on high mountain rock slopes is very limited. We use a numerical model and field measurements to estimate the water balance at a steep rock wall site. We show that snowmelt is the main source of water at elevations >3600 m and that snowpack hydrology and sublimation are key factors. The new information presented here can be used to improve the understanding of thermal, hydrogeological, and mechanical processes on steep mountain rock slopes.\n\nInvestigating the thermal state of permafrost with Bayesian inverse modeling of heat transfer\n\nBrian Groenke, Moritz Langer, Jan Nitzbon, Sebastian Westermann, Guillermo Gallego, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3505–3533, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3505-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is now well known from long-term temperature measurements that Arctic permafrost, i.e., ground that remains continuously frozen for at least 2 years, is warming in response to climate change. Temperature, however, only tells half of the story. In this study, we use computer modeling to better understand how the thawing and freezing of water in the ground affects the way permafrost responds to climate change and what temperature trends can and cannot tell us about how permafrost is changing.\n\nMeltwater runoff and glacier mass balance in the high Arctic: 1991â2022 simulations for Svalbard\n\nLouise Steffensen Schmidt, Thomas Vikhamar Schuler, Erin Emily Thomas, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2941–2963, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2941-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2941-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we present high-resolution simulations of glacier mass balance (the gain and loss of ice over a year) and runoff on Svalbard from 1991–2022, one of the fastest warming regions in the Arctic. The simulations are created using the CryoGrid community model. We find a small overall loss of mass over the simulation period of −0.08 m yrâ1 but with no statistically significant trend. The average runoff was found to be 41 Gt yrâ1, with a significant increasing trend of 6.3 Gt per decade.\n\nPost-Little Ice Age rock wall permafrost evolution in Norway\n\nJustyna Czekirda, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Sebastian Westermann, Ketil Isaksen, and Florence Magnin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2725–2754, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2725-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2725-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess spatio-temporal permafrost variations in selected rock walls in Norway over the last 120 years. Ground temperature is modelled using the two-dimensional ground heat flux model CryoGrid 2D along nine profiles. Permafrost probably occurs at most sites. All simulations show increasing ground temperature from the 1980s. Our simulations show that rock wall permafrost with a temperature of −1 °C at 20 m depth could thaw at this depth within 50 years.\n\nSnowâvegetationâatmosphere interactions in alpine tundra\n\nNorbert Pirk, Kristoffer Aalstad, Yeliz A. Yilmaz, Astrid Vatne, Andrea L. Popp, Peter Horvath, Anders Bryn, Ane Victoria Vollsnes, Sebastian Westermann, Terje Koren Berntsen, Frode Stordal, and Lena Merete Tallaksen\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2031–2047, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2031-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2031-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured the landâatmosphere exchange of CO2 and water vapor in alpine Norway over 3 years. The extremely snow-rich conditions in 2020 reduced the total annual evapotranspiration to 50 % and reduced the growing-season carbon assimilation to turn the ecosystem from a moderate annual carbon sink to an even stronger source. Our analysis suggests that snow cover anomalies are driving the most consequential short-term responses in this ecosystemâs functioning.\n\nCoastal retreat rates of high-Arctic rock cliffs on Brøgger peninsula, Svalbard, accelerate during the past decade\n\nJuditha Aga, Livia Piermattei, Luc Girod, Kristoffer Aalstad, Trond Eiken, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-321,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-321, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal rock cliffs on Svalbard are considered to be fairly stable, however, long-term trends of coastal retreat rates are unknown so far. This study presents changes in the coastline along Brøgger Peninsula, Svalbard, based on aerial images from 1970, 1990, 2010 and 2021. Our analysis shows that coastal retreat rates accelerate in the time period 2010–2021, which coincides with increasing storminess, retreating sea ice and increasing ground temperatures.\n\nSimulating the effect of subsurface drainage on the thermal regime and ground ice in blocky terrain in Norway\n\nCas Renette, Kristoffer Aalstad, Juditha Aga, Robin Benjamin Zweigel, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Karianne Staalesen LilleÃ¸ren, Ketil Isaksen, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 11, 33–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-33-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-33-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOne of the reasons for lower ground temperatures in coarse, blocky terrain is a low or varying soil moisture content, which most permafrost modelling studies did not take into account. We used the CryoGrid community model to successfully simulate this effect and found markedly lower temperatures in well-drained, blocky deposits compared to other set-ups. The inclusion of this drainage effect is another step towards a better model representation of blocky mountain terrain in permafrost regions.\n\nInferring surface energy fluxes using drone data assimilation in large eddy simulations\n\nNorbert Pirk, Kristoffer Aalstad, Sebastian Westermann, Astrid Vatne, Alouette van Hove, Lena Merete Tallaksen, Massimo Cassiani, and Gabriel Katul\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7293–7314, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7293-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7293-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we show how sparse and noisy drone measurements can be combined with an ensemble of turbulence-resolving wind simulations to estimate uncertainty-aware surface energy exchange. We demonstrate the feasibility of this drone data assimilation framework in a series of synthetic and real-world experiments. This new framework can, in future, be applied to estimate energy and gas exchange in heterogeneous landscapes more representatively than conventional methods.\n\nA high spatial resolution soil carbon and nitrogen dataset for the northern permafrost region based on circumpolar land cover upscaling\n\nJuri Palmtag, Jaroslav Obu, Peter Kuhry, Andreas Richter, Matthias B. Siewert, Niels Weiss, Sebastian Westermann, and Gustaf Hugelius\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 4095–4110, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4095-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4095-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe northern permafrost region covers 22 % of the Northern Hemisphere and holds almost twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. This paper presents data from 651 soil pedons encompassing more than 6500 samples from 16 different study areas across the northern permafrost region. We use this dataset together with ESA's global land cover dataset to estimate soil organic carbon and total nitrogen storage up to 300 cm soil depth, with estimated values of 813 Pg for carbon and 55 Pg for nitrogen.\n\nExplicitly modelling microtopography in permafrost landscapes in a land surface model (JULES vn5.4_microtopography)\n\nNoah D. Smith, Eleanor J. Burke, Kjetil Schanke Aas, Inge H. J. Althuizen, Julia Boike, Casper Tai Christiansen, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Thomas Friborg, Hanna Lee, Heather Rumbold, Rachael H. Turton, Sebastian Westermann, and Sarah E. Chadburn\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3603–3639, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3603-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3603-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic has large areas of small mounds that are caused by ice lifting up the soil. Snow blown by wind gathers in hollows next to these mounds, insulating them in winter. The hollows tend to be wetter, and thus the soil absorbs more heat in summer. The warm wet soil in the hollows decomposes, releasing methane. We have made a model of this, and we have tested how it behaves and whether it looks like sites in Scandinavia and Siberia. Sometimes we get more methane than a model without mounds.\n\nA new approach to simulate peat accumulation, degradation and stability in a global land surface scheme (JULES vn5.8_accumulate_soil) for northern and temperate peatlands\n\nSarah E. Chadburn, Eleanor J. Burke, Angela V. Gallego-Sala, Noah D. Smith, M. Syndonia Bret-Harte, Dan J. Charman, Julia Drewer, Colin W. Edgar, Eugenie S. Euskirchen, Krzysztof Fortuniak, Yao Gao, Mahdi Nakhavali, WÅodzimierz Pawlak, Edward A. G. Schuur, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1633–1657, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1633-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1633-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new method to include peatlands in an Earth system model (ESM). Peatlands store huge amounts of carbon that accumulates very slowly but that can be rapidly destabilised, emitting greenhouse gases. Our model captures the dynamic nature of peat by simulating the change in surface height and physical properties of the soil as carbon is added or decomposed. Thus, we model, for the first time in an ESM, peat dynamics and its threshold behaviours that can lead to destabilisation.\n\nPermafrost in monitored unstable rock slopes in Norway â new insights from temperature and surface velocity measurements, geophysical surveying, and ground temperature modelling\n\nBernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Justyna Czekirda, Florence Magnin, Pierre-Allain Duvillard, Ludovic Ravanel, Emanuelle Malet, Andreas Aspaas, Lene Kristensen, Ingrid Skrede, Gudrun D. Majala, Benjamin Jacobs, Johannes Leinauer, Christian Hauck, Christin Hilbich, Martina BÃ¶hme, Reginald Hermanns, Harald Ã. Eriksen, Tom Rune Lauknes, Michael Krautblatter, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 10, 97–129, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-97-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-97-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper is a multi-authored study documenting the possible existence of permafrost in permanently monitored rockslides in Norway for the first time by combining a multitude of field data, including geophysical surveys in rock walls. The paper discusses the possible role of thermal regime and rockslide movement, and it evaluates the possible impact of atmospheric warming on rockslide dynamics in Norwegian mountains.\n\nLateral thermokarst patterns in permafrost peat plateaus in northern Norway\n\nLÃ©o C. P. Martin, Jan Nitzbon, Johanna Scheer, Kjetil S. Aas, Trond Eiken, Moritz Langer, Simon Filhol, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3423–3442, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3423-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3423-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is important to understand how permafrost landscapes respond to climate changes because their thaw can contribute to global warming. We investigate how a common permafrost morphology degrades using both field observations of the surface elevation and numerical modeling. We show that numerical models accounting for topographic changes related to permafrost degradation can reproduce the observed changes in nature and help us understand how parameters such as snow influence this phenomenon.\n\nSurface temperatures and their influence on the permafrost thermal regime in high-Arctic rock walls on Svalbard\n\nJuditha Undine Schmidt, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Thomas Vikhamar Schuler, Florence Magnin, Julia Boike, Moritz Langer, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2491–2509, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2491-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2491-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents rock surface temperatures (RSTs) of steep high-Arctic rock walls on Svalbard from 2016 to 2020. The field data show that coastal cliffs are characterized by warmer RSTs than inland locations during winter seasons. By running model simulations, we analyze factors leading to that effect, calculate the surface energy balance and simulate different future scenarios. Both field data and model results can contribute to a further understanding of RST in high-Arctic rock walls.\n\nConsequences of permafrost degradation for Arctic infrastructure â bridging the model gap between regional and engineering scales\n\nThomas Schneider von Deimling, Hanna Lee, Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen, Sebastian Westermann, Vladimir Romanovsky, Scott Lamoureux, Donald A. Walker, Sarah Chadburn, Erin Trochim, Lei Cai, Jan Nitzbon, Stephan Jacobi, and Moritz Langer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2451–2471, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2451-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2451-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate warming puts infrastructure built on permafrost at risk of failure. There is a growing need for appropriate model-based risk assessments. Here we present a modelling study and show an exemplary case of how a gravel road in a cold permafrost environment in Alaska might suffer from degrading permafrost under a scenario of intense climate warming. We use this case study to discuss the broader-scale applicability of our model for simulating future Arctic infrastructure failure.\n\nEffects of multi-scale heterogeneity on the simulated evolution of ice-rich permafrost lowlands under a warming climate\n\nJan Nitzbon, Moritz Langer, LÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Thomas Schneider von Deimling, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1399–1422, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1399-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1399-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a numerical model to investigate how small-scale landscape heterogeneities affect permafrost thaw under climate-warming scenarios. Our results show that representing small-scale heterogeneities in the model can decide whether a landscape is water-logged or well-drained in the future. This in turn affects how fast permafrost thaws under warming. Our research emphasizes the importance of considering small-scale processes in model assessments of permafrost thaw under climate change.\n\nVariability of the surface energy balance in permafrost-underlain boreal forest\n\nSimone Maria Stuenzi, Julia Boike, William Cable, Ulrike Herzschuh, Stefan Kruse, Luidmila A. Pestryakova, Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Sebastian Westermann, Evgenii S. Zakharov, and Moritz Langer\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 343–365, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-343-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-343-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBoreal forests in eastern Siberia are an essential component of global climate patterns. We use a physically based model and field measurements to study the interactions between forests, permanently frozen ground and the atmosphere. We find that forests exert a strong control on the thermal state of permafrost through changing snow cover dynamics and altering the surface energy balance, through absorbing most of the incoming solar radiation and suppressing below-canopy turbulent fluxes.\n\nProjecting circum-Arctic excess-ground-ice melt with a sub-grid representation in the Community Land Model\n\nLei Cai, Hanna Lee, Kjetil Schanke Aas, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 4611–4626, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4611-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4611-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA sub-grid representation of excess ground ice in the Community Land Model (CLM) is developed as novel progress in modeling permafrost thaw and its impacts under the warming climate. The modeled permafrost degradation with sub-grid excess ice follows the pathway that continuous permafrost transforms into discontinuous permafrost before it disappears, including surface subsidence and talik formation, which are highly permafrost-relevant landscape changes excluded from most land models.\n\nPan-Antarctic map of near-surface permafrost temperatures at 1 km2 scale\n\nJaroslav Obu, Sebastian Westermann, GonÃ§alo Vieira, Andrey Abramov, Megan Ruby Balks, Annett Bartsch, Filip HrbÃ¡Äek, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Miguel Ramos\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 497–519, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-497-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-497-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLittle is known about permafrost in the Antarctic outside of the few research stations. We used a simple equilibrium permafrost model to estimate permafrost temperatures in the whole Antarctic. The lowest permafrost temperature on Earth is −36 °C in the Queen Elizabeth Range in the Transantarctic Mountains. Temperatures are commonly between −23 and −18 °C in mountainous areas rising above the Antarctic Ice Sheet, between −14 and −8 °C in coastal areas, and up to 0 °C on the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nHyper-resolution ensemble-based snow reanalysis in mountain regions using clustering\n\nJoel Fiddes, Kristoffer Aalstad, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4717–4736, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4717-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4717-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we address one of the big challenges in snow hydrology, namely the accurate simulation of the seasonal snowpack in ungauged regions. We do this by assimilating satellite observations of snow cover into a modelling framework. Importantly (and a novelty of the paper), we include a clustering approach that permits highly efficient ensemble simulations. Efficiency gains and dependency on purely global datasets, means that this method can be applied over large areas anywhere on Earth.\n\nPermafrost distribution in steep rock slopes in Norway: measurements, statistical modelling and implications for geomorphological processes\n\nFlorence Magnin, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Sebastian Westermann, Ketil Isaksen, Paula Hilger, and Reginald L. Hermanns\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 7, 1019–1040, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-1019-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-1019-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study proposes the first permafrost (i.e. ground with temperature permanently < 0 Â°C) map covering the steep rock slopes of Norway. It was created by using rock temperature data collected at the near surface of 25 rock walls spread across the country between 2010 and 2018. The map shows that permafrost mostly exists above 1300–1400 m a.s.l. in southern Norway and close to sea level in northern Norway. The results have strong potential for the study of rock wall sliding and failure.\n\nProjecting Circum-Arctic Excess Ground Ice Melt with a sub-grid representation in the Community Land Model\n\nLei Cai, Hanna Lee, Sebastian Westermann, and Kjetil Schanke Aas\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-230,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-230, 2019\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a sub-grid representation of excess ground ice in the Community Land Model (CLM) by adding three landunits to the original CLM sub-grid hierarchy, in order to prescribe three different excess ice conditions in one grid cell. Single-grid simulations verify the potential of the model development on better projecting excess ice melt in a warming climate. Global simulations recommend the proper way of applying the model development with the existing excess ice dataset.\n\nPathways of ice-wedge degradation in polygonal tundra under different hydrological conditions\n\nJan Nitzbon, Moritz Langer, Sebastian Westermann, LÃ©o Martin, Kjetil Schanke Aas, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1089–1123, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1089-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1089-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the stability of ice wedges (massive bodies of ground ice in permafrost) under recent climatic conditions in the Lena River delta of northern Siberia. For this we used a novel modelling approach that takes into account lateral transport of heat, water, and snow and the subsidence of the ground surface due to melting of ground ice. We found that wetter conditions have a destabilizing effect on the ice wedges and associated our simulation results with observations from the study area.\n\nThaw processes in ice-rich permafrost landscapes represented with laterally coupled tiles in a land surface model\n\nKjetil S. Aas, LÃ©o Martin, Jan Nitzbon, Moritz Langer, Julia Boike, Hanna Lee, Terje K.

This results in lateral fluxes of snow, water, and heat, which we investigate and show how it can be accounted for in large-scale models. Using a novel model technique which can account for these differences, we are able to model both the current state of permafrost and how these landscapes change as permafrost thaws, in a way that could not previously be achieved.\n\nA 20-year record (1998–2017) of permafrost, active layer and meteorological conditions at a high Arctic permafrost research site (Bayelva, Spitsbergen)\n\nJulia Boike, Inge Juszak, Stephan Lange, Sarah Chadburn, Eleanor Burke, Pier Paul Overduin, Kurt Roth, Olaf Ippisch, Niko Bornemann, Lielle Stern, Isabelle Gouttevin, Ernst Hauber, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 355–390, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-355-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-355-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA 20-year data record from the Bayelva site at Ny-Ã lesund, Svalbard, is presented on meteorology, energy balance components, surface and subsurface observations. This paper presents the data set, instrumentation, calibration, processing and data quality control. The data show that mean annual, summer and winter soil temperature data from shallow to deeper depths have been warming over the period of record, indicating the degradation and loss of permafrost at this site.\n\nEnsemble-based assimilation of fractional snow-covered area satellite retrievals to estimate the snow distribution at Arctic sites\n\nKristoffer Aalstad, Sebastian Westermann, Thomas Vikhamar Schuler, Julia Boike, and Laurent Bertino\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 247–270, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-247-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-247-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate how snow cover data from satellites can be used to constrain estimates of snow distributions at sites in the Arctic. In this effort, we make use of data assimilation to combine the information contained in the snow cover data with a simple snow model. By comparing our snow distribution estimates to independent observations, we find that this method performs favorably. Being modular, this method could be applied to other areas as a component of a larger reanalysis system.\n\nCarbon stocks and fluxes in the high latitudes: using site-level data to evaluate Earth system models\n\nSarah E.

Parmentier, Shushi Peng, Ko Van Huissteden, Tao Wang, Sebastian Westermann, Dan Zhu, and Eleanor J. Burke\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 5143–5169, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5143-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5143-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth system models (ESMs) are our main tools for understanding future climate. The Arctic is important for the future carbon cycle, particularly due to the large carbon stocks in permafrost. We evaluated the performance of the land component of three major ESMs at Arctic tundra sites, focusing on the fluxes and stocks of carbon. We show that the next steps for model improvement are to better represent vegetation dynamics, to include mosses and to improve below-ground carbon cycle processes.\n\nTransient modeling of the ground thermal conditions using satellite data in the Lena River delta, Siberia\n\nSebastian Westermann, Maria Peter, Moritz Langer, Georg Schwamborn, Lutz Schirrmeister, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1441–1463, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1441-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1441-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate a remote-sensing-based scheme estimating the evolution of ground temperature and active layer thickness by means of a ground thermal model. A comparison to in situ observations from the Lena River delta in Siberia indicates that the model is generally capable of reproducing the annual temperature regime and seasonal thawing of the ground. The approach could hence be a first step towards remote detection of ground thermal conditions in permafrost areas.\n\nStrong degradation of palsas and peat plateaus in northern Norway during the last 60Â years\n\nAmund F. Borge, Sebastian Westermann, Ingvild Solheim, and Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1–16, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPalsas and peat plateaus are permafrost landforms in subarctic mires which constitute sensitive ecosystems with strong significance for vegetation, wildlife, hydrology and carbon cycle. We have systematically mapped the occurrence of palsas and peat plateaus in northern Norway by interpretation of aerial images from the 1950s until today. The results show that about half of the area of palsas and peat plateaus has disappeared due to lateral erosion and melting of ground ice in the last 50 years.\n\nSmall-scale variation of snow in a regional permafrost model\n\nKjersti GisnÃ¥s, Sebastian Westermann, Thomas Vikhamar Schuler, Kjetil Melvold, and Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1201–1215, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1201-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1201-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn wind exposed areas snow redistribution results in large spatial variability in ground temperatures. In these areas, the ground temperature of a grid cell must be determined based on the distribution, and not the average, of snow depths. We employ distribution functions of snow in a regional permafrost model, showing highly improved representation of ground temperatures. By including snow distributions, we find the permafrost area to be nearly twice as large as what is modelled without.\n\nSimulating the thermal regime and thaw processes of ice-rich permafrost ground with the land-surface model CryoGrid 3\n\nS. Westermann, M. Langer, J. Boike, M. Heikenfeld, M. Peter, B. EtzelmÃ¼ller, and G. Krinner\n\nGeosci.

We present a new land-surface scheme designed for permafrost applications, CryoGrid 3, which constitutes a flexible platform to explore new parameterizations for a range of permafrost processes.\n\nA ground temperature map of the North Atlantic permafrost region based on remote sensing and reanalysis data\n\nS. Westermann, T. I. Ãstby, K. GisnÃ¥s, T. V. Schuler, and B. EtzelmÃ¼ller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 1303–1319, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1303-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1303-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use remotely sensed land surface temperature and land cover in conjunction with air temperature and snowfall from a reanalysis product as input for a simple permafrost model. The scheme is applied to the permafrost regions bordering the North Atlantic. A comparison with ground temperatures in boreholes suggests a modeling accuracy of 2 to 2.5 Â°C.\n\nFuture permafrost conditions along environmental gradients in Zackenberg, Greenland\n\nS. Westermann, B. Elberling, S. HÃ¸jlund Pedersen, M. Stendel, B. U. Hansen, and G. E. Liston\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 719–735, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-719-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-719-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe development of ground temperatures in permafrost areas is influenced by many factors varying on different spatial and temporal scales. We present numerical simulations of ground temperatures for the Zackenberg valley in NE Greenland, which take into account the spatial variability of snow depths, surface and ground properties at a scale of 10m. The ensemble of the model grid cells suggests a spatial variability of annual average ground temperatures of up to 5Â°C.\n\nFrozen ponds: production and storage of methane during the Arctic winter in a lowland tundra landscape in northern Siberia, Lena River delta\n\nM. Langer, S. Westermann, K. Walter Anthony, K. Wischnewski, and J. Boike\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 977–990, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-977-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-977-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane production rates of Arctic ponds during the freezing period within a typical tundra landscape in northern Siberia are presented. Production rates were inferred by inverse modeling based on measured methane concentrations in the ice cover. Results revealed marked differences in early winter methane production among ponds showing different stages of shore degradation. This suggests that shore erosion can increase methane production of Arctic ponds by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude.\n\nAnnual CO2 budget and seasonal CO2 exchange signals at a high Arctic permafrost site on Spitsbergen, Svalbard archipelago\n\nJ.

We want to understand changes to the Lena River, a major Arctic river flowing to the Arctic Ocean, by collecting 4.5 years of detailed water data, including temperature and carbon and nutrient contents. This dataset records current conditions and helps us to detect future changes.

In the present study, we compared the results produced from two different types of satellite data between different research groups and against validation measurements from aeroplanes. We found a large spread between individual results but showed that the group ensemble can be used to reliably estimate glacier elevation changes and related errors from satellite data.\n\nImpact of livestock activity on near-surface ground temperatures in Mongolia\n\nRobin B. Zweigel, Avirmed Dashtseren, Khurelbaatar Temuujin, Anarmaa Sharkhuu, Clare Webster, Hanna Lee, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1790,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1790, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIntense grazing at grassland sites removes vegetation, reduces the snow cover, and inhibits litter layers from forming. Grazed sites generally have a larger annual ground surface temperature amplitude than ungrazed sites, but the net effect depends on effects in the transitional seasons. Our results also suggest that seasonal use of pastures can reduce ground temperatures, which can be a strategy to protect currently degrading grassland permafrost.\n\nMulti-scale variations of subglacial hydro-mechanical conditions at Kongsvegen glacier, Svalbard\n\nColine Bouchayer, Ugo Nanni, Pierre-Marie Lefeuvre, John Hult, Louise Steffensen Schmidt, Jack Kohler, FranÃ§ois Renard, and Thomas V. Schuler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2939–2968, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2939-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2939-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explore the interplay between surface runoff and subglacial conditions. We focus on Kongsvegen glacier in Svalbard. We drilled 350 m down to the glacier base to measure water pressure, till strength, seismic noise, and glacier surface velocity. In the low-melt season, the drainage system adapted gradually, while the high-melt season led to a transient response, exceeding drainage capacity and enhancing sliding. Our findings contribute to discussions on subglacial hydro-mechanical processes.\n\nA machine learning approach to the geomorphometric detection of ribbed moraines in Norway\n\nThomas J. Barnes, Thomas V. Schuler, Simon Filhol, and Karianne S. LilleÃ¸ren\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 12, 801–818, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-12-801-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-12-801-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we use machine learning to automatically outline landforms based on their characteristics. We test several methods to identify the most accurate and then proceed to develop the most accurate to improve its accuracy further. We manage to outline landforms with 65 %–75 % accuracy, at a resolution of 10 m, thanks to high-quality/high-resolution elevation data. We find that it is possible to run this method at a country scale to quickly produce landform inventories for future studies.\n\nData Quality of OpenStreetMap for Industrial Sites in the Arctic\n\nDaniel Kwakye, Sabrina Marx, Benjamin Herfort, Moritz Langer, and Sven Lautenbach\n\nAGILE GIScience Ser., 5, 34, https://doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-5-34-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-5-34-2024, 2024\n\nBrief communication: Testing a portable Bullard-type temperature lance confirms highly spatially heterogeneous sediment temperatures under shallow bodies of water in the Arctic\n\nFrederieke Miesner, William Lambert Cable, Pier Paul Overduin, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2603–2611, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2603-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2603-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe temperature in the sediment below Arctic lakes determines the stability of the permafrost and microbial activity. However, measurements are scarce because of the remoteness. We present a robust and portable device to fill this gap. Test campaigns have demonstrated its utility in a range of environments during winter and summer. The measured temperatures show a great variability within and across locations. The data can be used to validate models and estimate potential emissions.\n\nSpatio-temporal snow data assimilation with the ICESat-2 laser altimeter\n\nMarco Mazzolini, Kristoffer Aalstad, Esteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez, Sebastian Westermann, and DÃ©sirÃ©e Treichler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1404,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1404, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we use the satellite laser altimeter ICESat-2 to retrieve snow depth in areas where snow amounts are still poorly estimated despite the high societal importance. We explore how to update snow models with these observations through algorithms that spatially propagate the information beyond the narrow satellite profiles. The positive results show the potential of this approach for improving snow simulations, both in terms of average snow depth and spatial distribution.\n\nModelling present and future rock wall permafrost distribution in the Sisimiut mountain area, West Greenland\n\nMarco Marcer, Pierre-Allain Duvillard, SoÅa TomaÅ¡koviÄovÃ¡, Steffen RingsÃ¸ Nielsen, AndrÃ© Revil, and Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1753–1771, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1753-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1753-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study models present and future rock wall temperatures in the mountains near Sisimiut, creating knowledge on mountain permafrost in Greenland for the first time. Bedrock is mostly frozen but also has temperatures near 0 oC, making it very sensitive to climate changes. Future climatic scenarios indicate a reduction in frozen rock wall areas. Since mountain permafrost thaw is linked to an increase in landslides, these results call for more efforts addressing mountain permafrost in Greenland.\n\nMapping subsea permafrost around Tuktoyaktuk Island (NWT, Canada) using electrical resistivity tomography\n\nEphraim Erkens, Michael Angelopoulos, Jens Tronicke, Scott R. Dallimore, Dustin Whalen, Julia Boike, and Pier Paul Overduin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1044,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1044, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the depth of subsea permafrost formed by inundation of terrestrial permafrost due to marine transgression around the rapidly disappearing, permafrost-cored Tuktoyaktuk Island (Beaufort Sea, NWT, Canada). We use geoelectrical surveys with floating electrodes to identify the boundary between unfrozen and frozen sediment. Our findings indicate that permafrost thaw depths beneath the seabed can be explained by coastal erosion rates and landscape features before inundation.\n\nMultitemporal UAV LiDAR detects seasonal heave and subsidence on palsas\n\nCas Renette, Mats Olvmo, Sofia Thorsson, BjÃ¶rn Holmer, and Heather Reese\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-141,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-141, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a drone to monitor seasonal changes in the height of subarctic permafrost mounds (palsas). With five drone flights in one year, we found a seasonal fluctuation of ca. 15 cm as result of freeze/thaw cycles. On one mound, a large area sank down between each flight as a result of permafrost thaw. The approach of using repeated high-resolution scans from such drone is unique for such environments and highlights its effectiveness in capturing the subtle dynamics of permafrost landscapes.\n\nCarbon degradation and mobilisation potentials of thawing permafrost peatlands in Northern Norway\n\nSigrid Trier KjÃ¦r, Sebastian Westermann, Nora Nedkvitne, and Peter DÃ¶rsch\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-562,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-562, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost peatlands are thawing due to climate change, releasing large quantities of carbon that degrades upon thawing and is released as CO2, CH4, or dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We incubated thawed Norwegian permafrost peat plateaus and thermokarst pond sediment found next to permafrost for up to 350 days to measure carbon loss. CO2 production was largest initially, while CH4 production increased over time. The largest carbon loss was measured at the top of the peat plateau core as DOC.\n\nSimulating net ecosystem exchange under seasonal snow cover at an Arctic tundra site\n\nVictoria R. Dutch, Nick Rutter, Leanne Wake, Oliver Sonnentag, Gabriel Hould Gosselin, Melody Sandells, Chris Derksen, Branden Walker, Gesa Meyer, Richard Essery, Richard Kelly, Phillip Marsh, Julia Boike, and Matteo Detto\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 825–841, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-825-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-825-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe undertake a sensitivity study of three different parameters on the simulation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during the snow-covered non-growing season at an Arctic tundra site. Simulations are compared to eddy covariance measurements, with near-zero NEE simulated despite observed CO2 release. We then consider how to parameterise the model better in Arctic tundra environments on both sub-seasonal timescales and cumulatively throughout the snow-covered non-growing season.\n\nThe evolution of Arctic permafrost over the last 3Â centuries from ensemble simulations with the CryoGridLite permafrost model\n\nMoritz Langer, Jan Nitzbon, Brian Groenke, Lisa-Marie Assmann, Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Simone Maria Stuenzi, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 363–385, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-363-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-363-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a model that can simulate the evolution of Arctic permafrost over centuries to millennia, we find that post-industrialization permafrost warming has three \"hotspots\" in NE Canada, N Alaska, and W Siberia. The extent of near-surface permafrost has decreased substantially since 1850, with the largest area losses occurring in the last 50 years. The simulations also show that volcanic eruptions have in some cases counteracted the loss of near-surface permafrost for a few decades.\n\nCoupled thermoâgeophysical inversion for permafrost monitoring\n\nSoÅa TomaÅ¡koviÄovÃ¡ and Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 321–340, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-321-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-321-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the results of a fully coupled modeling framework for simulating the ground thermal regime using only surface measurements to calibrate the thermal model. The heat conduction model is forced by surface ground temperature measurements and calibrated using the field measurements of time lapse apparent electrical resistivity. The resistivity-calibrated thermal model achieves a performance comparable to the traditional calibration of borehole temperature measurements.\n\nClimate change is rapidly deteriorating the climatic signal in Svalbard glaciers\n\nAndrea Spolaor, Federico Scoto, Catherine Larose, Elena Barbaro, Francois Burgay, Mats P.

Thanks to a multidisciplinary approach we demonstrate a progressive deterioration of the isotope signal in the firn core. We link the degradation of the δ18O signal to the increased occurrence and intensity of melt events associated with the rapid warming occurring in the archipelago.\n\nRapid warming and degradation of mountain permafrost in Norway and Iceland\n\nBernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Ketil Isaksen, Justyna Czekirda, Sebastian Westermann, Christin Hilbich, and Christian Hauck\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5477–5497, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5477-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost (permanently frozen ground) is widespread in the mountains of Norway and Iceland. Several boreholes were drilled after 1999 for long-term permafrost monitoring. We document a strong warming of permafrost, including the development of unfrozen bodies in the permafrost. Warming and degradation of mountain permafrost may lead to more natural hazards.\n\nSpatio-temporal information propagation using sparse observations in hyper-resolution ensemble-based snow data assimilation\n\nEsteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez, Kristoffer Aalstad, Norbert Pirk, Marco Mazzolini, DÃ©sirÃ©e Treichler, Paul Leclercq, Sebastian Westermann, Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno, and Simon Gascoin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We propose a new way of propagating information throughout the simulations adapted to the hyper-resolution, which could also be used to improve simulations of other nature. The method has been implemented in an open-source data assimilation tool that is readily accessible to everyone.\n\nSnow accumulation, albedo and melt patterns following road construction on permafrost, InuvikâTuktoyaktuk Highway, Canada\n\nJennika Hammar, Inge GrÃ¼nberg, Steven V. Kokelj, Jurjen van der Sluijs, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5357–5372, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5357-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5357-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoads on permafrost have significant environmental effects. This study assessed the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway (ITH) in Canada and its impact on snow accumulation, albedo and snowmelt timing. Our findings revealed that snow accumulation increased by up to 36 m from the road, 12-day earlier snowmelt within 100 m due to reduced albedo, and altered snowmelt patterns in seemingly undisturbed areas. Remote sensing aids in understanding road impacts on permafrost.\n\nDevelopment of multiple taliks near settlements on Svalbard – a new source of drinking water for the High Arctic?\n\nAnatoly O. Sinitsyn, Sara Bazin, Rasmus Benestad, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Ketil Isaksen, Hanne Kvitsand, Julia Lutz, Andrea L. Popp, Lena Rubensdotter, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2950,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2950, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study looked at under the ground on Svalbard, an archipelago close to the North Pole. We found something very surprising – there is water under the all year around frozen soil. This was not known before. This water could be used for drinking if we manage it carefully. This is important because getting clean drinking water is very difficult in Svalbard, and other Arctic places. Also, because the climate is getting warmer, there might be even more water underground in the future.\n\nRecent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes\n\nLÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Michele Magni, Fanny Brun, Joel Fiddes, Yanbin Lei, Philip Kraaijenbrink, Tamara Mathys, Moritz Langer, Simon Allen, and Walter W. Immerzeel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4409–4436, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAcross the Tibetan Plateau, many large lakes have been changing level during the last decades as a response to climate change. In high-mountain environments, water fluxes from the land to the lakes are linked to the ground temperature of the land and to the energy fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, which are modified by climate change. With a numerical model, we test how these water and energy fluxes have changed over the last decades and how they influence the lake level variations.\n\nSimulating ice segregation and thaw consolidation in permafrost environments with the CryoGrid community model\n\nJuditha Aga, Julia Boike, Moritz Langer, Thomas Ingeman-Nielsen, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4179–4206, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4179-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4179-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a new model scheme for simulating ice segregation and thaw consolidation in permafrost environments, depending on ground properties and climatic forcing. It is embedded in the CryoGrid community model, a land surface model for the terrestrial cryosphere. We describe the model physics and functionalities, followed by a model validation and a sensitivity study of controlling factors.\n\nSuper-high-resolution aerial imagery datasets of permafrost landscapes in Alaska and northwestern Canada\n\nTabea Rettelbach, Ingmar Nitze, Inge GrÃ¼nberg, Jennika Hammar, Simon SchÃ¤ffler, Daniel Hein, Matthias Gessner, Tilman Bucher, JÃ¶rg Brauchle, JÃ¶rg Hartmann, Torsten Sachs, Julia Boike, and Guido Grosse\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-193,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-193, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript under review for ESSD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost landscapes in the Arctic are rapidly changing due to climate warming. We here publish aerial images and elevation models with very high spatial detail that help study these landscapes in northwestern Canada and Alaska. The images were collected using the Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS). This dataset has significant implications for understanding permafrost landscape dynamics in response to climate change. It is publicly available for further research.\n\nEstimating surface water availability in high mountain rock slopes using a numerical energy balance model\n\nMatan Ben-Asher, Florence Magnin, Sebastian Westermann, JosuÃ© Bock, Emmanuel Malet, Johan Berthet, Ludovic Ravanel, and Philip Deline\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 11, 899–915, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-899-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-899-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantitative knowledge of water availability on high mountain rock slopes is very limited. We use a numerical model and field measurements to estimate the water balance at a steep rock wall site. We show that snowmelt is the main source of water at elevations >3600 m and that snowpack hydrology and sublimation are key factors. The new information presented here can be used to improve the understanding of thermal, hydrogeological, and mechanical processes on steep mountain rock slopes.\n\nInvestigating the thermal state of permafrost with Bayesian inverse modeling of heat transfer\n\nBrian Groenke, Moritz Langer, Jan Nitzbon, Sebastian Westermann, Guillermo Gallego, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3505–3533, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3505-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is now well known from long-term temperature measurements that Arctic permafrost, i.e., ground that remains continuously frozen for at least 2 years, is warming in response to climate change. Temperature, however, only tells half of the story. In this study, we use computer modeling to better understand how the thawing and freezing of water in the ground affects the way permafrost responds to climate change and what temperature trends can and cannot tell us about how permafrost is changing.\n\nMeltwater runoff and glacier mass balance in the high Arctic: 1991â2022 simulations for Svalbard\n\nLouise Steffensen Schmidt, Thomas Vikhamar Schuler, Erin Emily Thomas, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2941–2963, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2941-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2941-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we present high-resolution simulations of glacier mass balance (the gain and loss of ice over a year) and runoff on Svalbard from 1991–2022, one of the fastest warming regions in the Arctic. The simulations are created using the CryoGrid community model. We find a small overall loss of mass over the simulation period of −0.08 m yrâ1 but with no statistically significant trend. The average runoff was found to be 41 Gt yrâ1, with a significant increasing trend of 6.3 Gt per decade.\n\nSimulated methane emissions from Arctic ponds are highly sensitive to warming\n\nZoÃ© Rehder, Thomas Kleinen, Lars Kutzbach, Victor Stepanenko, Moritz Langer, and Victor Brovkin\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2837–2855, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a new model to investigate how methane emissions from Arctic ponds change with warming. We find that emissions increase substantially. Under annual temperatures 5 Â°C above present temperatures, pond methane emissions are more than 3 times higher than now. Most of this increase is caused by an increase in plant productivity as plants provide the substrate microbes used to produce methane. We conclude that vegetation changes need to be included in predictions of pond methane emissions.\n\nPost-Little Ice Age rock wall permafrost evolution in Norway\n\nJustyna Czekirda, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Sebastian Westermann, Ketil Isaksen, and Florence Magnin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2725–2754, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2725-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2725-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess spatio-temporal permafrost variations in selected rock walls in Norway over the last 120 years. Ground temperature is modelled using the two-dimensional ground heat flux model CryoGrid 2D along nine profiles. Permafrost probably occurs at most sites. All simulations show increasing ground temperature from the 1980s. Our simulations show that rock wall permafrost with a temperature of −1 °C at 20 m depth could thaw at this depth within 50 years.\n\nBrief communication: Rapid ââ¼â 335 âÃâ 106 m3 bed erosion after detachment of the Sedongpu Glacier (Tibet)\n\nAndreas KÃ¤Ã¤b and Luc Girod\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2533–2541, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2533-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2533-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFollowing the detachment of the 130 × 106 m3 Sedongpu Glacier (south-eastern Tibet) in 2018, the Sedongpu Valley underwent massive large-volume landscape changes. An enormous volume of in total around 330 × 106 m3 was rapidly eroded, forming a new canyon of up to 300 m depth, 1 km width, and almost 4 km length. Such consequences of glacier change in mountains have so far not been considered at this magnitude and speed.\n\nSnowâvegetationâatmosphere interactions in alpine tundra\n\nNorbert Pirk, Kristoffer Aalstad, Yeliz A. Yilmaz, Astrid Vatne, Andrea L. Popp, Peter Horvath, Anders Bryn, Ane Victoria Vollsnes, Sebastian Westermann, Terje Koren Berntsen, Frode Stordal, and Lena Merete Tallaksen\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2031–2047, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2031-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2031-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured the landâatmosphere exchange of CO2 and water vapor in alpine Norway over 3 years. The extremely snow-rich conditions in 2020 reduced the total annual evapotranspiration to 50 % and reduced the growing-season carbon assimilation to turn the ecosystem from a moderate annual carbon sink to an even stronger source. Our analysis suggests that snow cover anomalies are driving the most consequential short-term responses in this ecosystemâs functioning.\n\nContinental heat storage: contributions from the ground, inland waters, and permafrost thawing\n\nFrancisco JosÃ© Cuesta-Valero, Hugo Beltrami, Almudena GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, Gerhard Krinner, Moritz Langer, Andrew H.

Here, new estimates of continental heat storage are obtained, including changes in inland-water heat storage and permafrost heat storage in addition to changes in ground heat storage. We also argue that heat gains in all three components should be monitored independently of their magnitude due to heat-dependent processes affecting society and ecosystems.\n\nHeat stored in the Earth system 1960â2020: where does the energy go?\n\nKarina von Schuckmann, Audrey MiniÃ¨re, Flora Gues, Francisco JosÃ© Cuesta-Valero, Gottfried Kirchengast, Susheel Adusumilli, Fiammetta Straneo, MichaÃ«l Ablain, Richard P.

Since 1971, this accumulated heat reached record values at an increasing pace. The Earth heat inventory provides a comprehensive view on the status and expectation of global warming, and we call for an implementation of this global climate indicator into the Paris Agreementâs Global Stocktake.\n\nNunataryuk field campaigns: understanding the origin and fate of terrestrial organic matter in the coastal waters of the Mackenzie Delta region\n\nMartine Lizotte, Bennet Juhls, Atsushi Matsuoka, Philippe Massicotte, GaÃ«lle MÃ©vel, David Obie James Anikina, Sofia Antonova, Guislain BÃ©cu, Marine BÃ©guin, Simon BÃ©langer, Thomas BossÃ©-Demers, Lisa BrÃ¶der, Flavienne Bruyant, GwÃ©naÃ«lle Chaillou, JÃ©rÃ´me Comte, Raoul-Marie Couture, Emmanuel Devred, GabriÃ¨le Deslongchamps, Thibaud Dezutter, Miles Dillon, David Doxaran, Aude Flamand, Frank Fell, Joannie Ferland, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Forget, Michael Fritz, Thomas J.

What happens to this carbon-rich organic matter as it transits along the fresh to salty aquatic environments is still underdocumented. Four expeditions were conducted from April to September 2019 in the coastal area of the Beaufort Sea to study the fate of organic matter. This paper describes a rich set of data characterizing the composition and sources of organic matter.\n\nAn Arctic delta reduced-complexity model and its reproduction of key geomorphological structures\n\nNgai-Ham Chan, Moritz Langer, Bennet Juhls, Tabea Rettelbach, Paul Overduin, Kimberly Huppert, and Jean Braun\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 11, 259–285, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-259-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-259-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic river deltas influence how nutrients and soil organic carbon, carried by sediments from the Arctic landscape, are retained or released into the Arctic Ocean. Under climate change, the deltas themselves and their ecosystems are becoming more vulnerable. We build upon previous models to reproduce for the first time an important feature ubiquitous to Arctic deltas and simulate its future under climate warming. This can impact the future of Arctic deltas and the carbon release they moderate.\n\nCoastal retreat rates of high-Arctic rock cliffs on Brøgger peninsula, Svalbard, accelerate during the past decade\n\nJuditha Aga, Livia Piermattei, Luc Girod, Kristoffer Aalstad, Trond Eiken, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-321,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-321, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal rock cliffs on Svalbard are considered to be fairly stable, however, long-term trends of coastal retreat rates are unknown so far. This study presents changes in the coastline along Brøgger Peninsula, Svalbard, based on aerial images from 1970, 1990, 2010 and 2021. Our analysis shows that coastal retreat rates accelerate in the time period 2010–2021, which coincides with increasing storminess, retreating sea ice and increasing ground temperatures.\n\nInterdecadal glacier inventories in the Karakoram since the 1990s\n\nFuming Xie, Shiyin Liu, Yongpeng Gao, Yu Zhu, Tobias Bolch, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, Shimei Duan, Wenfei Miao, Jianfang Kang, Yaonan Zhang, Xiran Pan, Caixia Qin, Kunpeng Wu, Miaomiao Qi, Xianhe Zhang, Ying Yi, Fengze Han, Xiaojun Yao, Qiao Liu, Xin Wang, Zongli Jiang, Donghui Shangguan, Yong Zhang, Richard GrÃ¼nwald, Muhammad Adnan, Jyoti Karki, and Muhammad Saifullah\n\nEarth Syst.

We found that, by the 2020s, there were approximately 10 500 glaciers in the Karakoram mountains covering an area of 22 510.73 km2, of which ~ 10.2 % is covered by debris. During the past 30 years (from 1990 to 2020), the total glacier cover area in Karakoram remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in area of 23.5 km2.\n\nSimulating the effect of subsurface drainage on the thermal regime and ground ice in blocky terrain in Norway\n\nCas Renette, Kristoffer Aalstad, Juditha Aga, Robin Benjamin Zweigel, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Karianne Staalesen LilleÃ¸ren, Ketil Isaksen, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 11, 33–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-33-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-33-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOne of the reasons for lower ground temperatures in coarse, blocky terrain is a low or varying soil moisture content, which most permafrost modelling studies did not take into account. We used the CryoGrid community model to successfully simulate this effect and found markedly lower temperatures in well-drained, blocky deposits compared to other set-ups. The inclusion of this drainage effect is another step towards a better model representation of blocky mountain terrain in permafrost regions.\n\nRecent Evolution of Supraglacial Lakes on ice shelves in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica\n\nAnirudha Mahagaonkar, Geir Moholdt, and Thomas V. Schuler\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-4,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-4, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface meltwater lakes along the margins of the Antarctic Ice Sheet can be important for ice shelf dynamics and stability. We used optical satellite imagery to study seasonal evolution of meltwater lakes in Dronning Maud Land. We found large interannual variability in lake extents, but with consistent seasonal patterns. Although correlation with summer air temperature was strong locally, other climatic and environmental factors need to be considered to explain the large regional variability.\n\nThe Multiple Snow Data Assimilation System (MuSA v1.0)\n\nEsteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez, Kristoffer Aalstad, Mohamed Wassim Baba, JesÃºs Revuelto, Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno, Joel Fiddes, Richard Essery, and Simon Gascoin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 9127–9155, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-9127-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-9127-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow cover plays an important role in many processes, but its monitoring is a challenging task. The alternative is usually to simulate the snowpack, and to improve these simulations one of the most promising options is to fuse simulations with available observations (data assimilation). In this paper we present MuSA, a data assimilation tool which facilitates the implementation of snow monitoring initiatives, allowing the assimilation of a wide variety of remotely sensed snow cover information.\n\nInferring surface energy fluxes using drone data assimilation in large eddy simulations\n\nNorbert Pirk, Kristoffer Aalstad, Sebastian Westermann, Astrid Vatne, Alouette van Hove, Lena Merete Tallaksen, Massimo Cassiani, and Gabriel Katul\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7293–7314, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7293-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7293-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we show how sparse and noisy drone measurements can be combined with an ensemble of turbulence-resolving wind simulations to estimate uncertainty-aware surface energy exchange. We demonstrate the feasibility of this drone data assimilation framework in a series of synthetic and real-world experiments. This new framework can, in future, be applied to estimate energy and gas exchange in heterogeneous landscapes more representatively than conventional methods.\n\nSiDroForest: a comprehensive forest inventory of Siberian boreal forest investigations including drone-based point clouds, individually labeled trees, synthetically generated tree crowns, and Sentinel-2 labeled image patches\n\nFemke van Geffen, Birgit Heim, Frederic Brieger, Rongwei Geng, Iuliia A.

SiDroForest contains four datasets that include SfM point clouds, individually labeled trees, synthetic tree crowns and labeled Sentinel-2 patches that provide insights into the vegetation composition and forest structure of two important vegetation transition zones in Siberia, Russia.\n\nExploring the capabilities of electrical resistivity tomography to study subsea permafrost\n\nMauricio Arboleda-Zapata, Michael Angelopoulos, Pier Paul Overduin, Guido Grosse, Benjamin M. Jones, and Jens Tronicke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4423–4445, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4423-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4423-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate how we can reliably estimate the thawed–frozen permafrost interface with its associated uncertainties in subsea permafrost environments using 2D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. In addition, we show how further analyses considering 1D inversion and sensitivity assessments can help quantify and better understand 2D ERT inversion results. Our results illustrate the capabilities of the ERT method to get insights into the development of the subsea permafrost.\n\nTransitional rock glaciers at sea level in northern Norway\n\nKarianne S. LilleÃ¸ren, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Line Rouyet, Trond Eiken, Gaute Slinde, and Christin Hilbich\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 10, 975–996, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-975-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-975-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn northern Norway we have observed several rock glaciers at sea level. Rock glaciers are landforms that only form under the influence of permafrost, which is frozen ground. Our investigations show that the rock glaciers are probably not active under the current climate but most likely were active in the recent past. This shows how the Arctic now changes due to climate changes and also how similar areas in currently colder climates will change in the future.\n\nPre-collapse motion of the FebruaryÂ 2021 Chamoli rockâice avalanche, Indian Himalaya\n\nMaximillian Van Wyk de Vries, Shashank Bhushan, MylÃ¨ne Jacquemart, CÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, Etienne Berthier, Simon Gascoin, David E. Shean, Dan H. Shugar, and Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3309–3327, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3309-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3309-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOn 7 February 2021, a large rock–ice avalanche occurred in Chamoli, Indian Himalaya. The resulting debris flow swept down the nearby valley, leaving over 200 people dead or missing. We use a range of satellite datasets to investigate how the collapse area changed prior to collapse. We show that signs of instability were visible as early 5 years prior to collapse. However, it would likely not have been possible to predict the timing of the event from current satellite datasets.\n\nImpact of measured and simulated tundra snowpack properties on heat transfer\n\nVictoria R. Dutch, Nick Rutter, Leanne Wake, Melody Sandells, Chris Derksen, Branden Walker, Gabriel Hould Gosselin, Oliver Sonnentag, Richard Essery, Richard Kelly, Phillip Marsh, Joshua King, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4201–4222, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4201-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4201-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of the properties of the snow and soil were compared to simulations of the Community Land Model to see how well the model represents snow insulation. Simulations underestimated snow thermal conductivity and wintertime soil temperatures. We test two approaches to reduce the transfer of heat through the snowpack and bring simulated soil temperatures closer to measurements, with an alternative parameterisation of snow thermal conductivity being more appropriate.\n\nA high spatial resolution soil carbon and nitrogen dataset for the northern permafrost region based on circumpolar land cover upscaling\n\nJuri Palmtag, Jaroslav Obu, Peter Kuhry, Andreas Richter, Matthias B.

Data, 14, 4095–4110, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4095-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4095-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe northern permafrost region covers 22 % of the Northern Hemisphere and holds almost twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. This paper presents data from 651 soil pedons encompassing more than 6500 samples from 16 different study areas across the northern permafrost region. We use this dataset together with ESA's global land cover dataset to estimate soil organic carbon and total nitrogen storage up to 300 cm soil depth, with estimated values of 813 Pg for carbon and 55 Pg for nitrogen.\n\nBrief communication: Unravelling the composition and microstructure of a permafrost core using X-ray computed tomography\n\nJan Nitzbon, Damir Gadylyaev, Steffen SchlÃ¼ter, John Maximilian KÃ¶hne, Guido Grosse, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3507–3515, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3507-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3507-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe microstructure of permafrost soils contains clues to its formation and its preconditioning to future change. We used X-ray computed tomography (CT) to measure the composition of a permafrost drill core from Siberia. By combining CT with laboratory measurements, we determined the the proportions of pore ice, excess ice, minerals, organic matter, and gas contained in the core at an unprecedented resolution. Our work demonstrates the potential of CT to study permafrost properties and processes.\n\nLateral carbon export has low impact on the net ecosystem carbon balance of a polygonal tundra catchment\n\nLutz Beckebanze, Benjamin R. K. Runkle, Josefine Walz, Christian Wille, David Holl, Manuel Helbig, Julia Boike, Torsten Sachs, and Lars Kutzbach\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3863–3876, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3863-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3863-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we present observations of lateral and vertical carbon fluxes from a permafrost-affected study site in the Russian Arctic. From this dataset we estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance for this study site. We show that lateral carbon export has a low impact on the net ecosystem carbon balance during the complete study period (3 months). Nevertheless, our results also show that lateral carbon export can exceed vertical carbon uptake at the beginning of the growing season.\n\nIncorporating InSAR kinematics into rock glacier inventories: insights from 11 regions worldwide\n\nAldo Bertone, ChloÃ© Barboux, Xavier Bodin, Tobias Bolch, Francesco Brardinoni, Rafael Caduff, Hanne H. Christiansen, Margaret M. Darrow, Reynald Delaloye, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Ole Humlum, Christophe Lambiel, Karianne S. LilleÃ¸ren, Volkmar Mair, Gabriel Pellegrinon, Line Rouyet, Lucas Ruiz, and Tazio Strozzi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2769–2792, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2769-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2769-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the guidelines developed by the IPA Action Group and within the ESA Permafrost CCI project to include InSAR-based kinematic information in rock glacier inventories. Nine operators applied these guidelines to 11 regions worldwide; more than 3600 rock glaciers are classified according to their kinematics. We test and demonstrate the feasibility of applying common rules to produce homogeneous kinematic inventories at global scale, useful for hydrological and climate change purposes.\n\nThree different glacier surges at a spot: what satellites observe and what not\n\nFrank Paul, Livia Piermattei, DÃ©sirÃ©e Treichler, Lin Gilbert, Luc Girod, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, Ludivine Libert, Thomas Nagler, Tazio Strozzi, and Jan Wuite\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2505–2526, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2505-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2505-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacier surges are widespread in the Karakoram and have been intensely studied using satellite data and DEMs. We use time series of such datasets to study three glacier surges in the same region of the Karakoram. We found strongly contrasting advance rates and flow velocities, maximum velocities of 30 m d−1, and a change in the surge mechanism during a surge. A sensor comparison revealed good agreement, but steep terrain and the two smaller glaciers caused limitations for some of them.\n\nCorrelation dispersion as a measure to better estimate uncertainty in remotely sensed glacier displacements\n\nBas Altena, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Bert Wouters\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2285–2300, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2285-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2285-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRepeat overflights of satellites are used to estimate surface displacements. However, such products lack a simple error description for individual measurements, but variation in precision occurs, since the calculation is based on the similarity of texture. Fortunately, variation in precision manifests itself in the correlation peak, which is used for the displacement calculation. This spread is used to make a connection to measurement precision, which can be of great use for model inversion.\n\nGlacierâpermafrost relations in a high-mountain environment: 5 decades of kinematic monitoring at the Gruben site, Swiss Alps\n\nIsabelle GÃ¤rtner-Roer, Nina Brunner, Reynald Delaloye, Wilfried Haeberli, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Patrick Thee\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2083–2101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2083-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2083-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe intensely investigated the Gruben site in the Swiss Alps, where glaciers and permafrost landforms closely interact, to better understand cold-climate environments. By the interpretation of air photos from 5 decades, we describe long-term developments of the existing landforms. In combination with high-resolution positioning measurements and ground surface temperatures, we were also able to link these to short-term changes and describe different landform responses to climate forcing.\n\nHigh-resolution bathymetry models for the Lena Delta and Kolyma Gulf coastal zones\n\nMatthias Fuchs, Juri Palmtag, Bennet Juhls, Pier Paul Overduin, Guido Grosse, Ahmed Abdelwahab, Michael Bedington, Tina Sanders, Olga Ogneva, Irina V. Fedorova, Nikita S. Zimov, Paul J. Mann, and Jens Strauss\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 2279–2301, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2279-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2279-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe created digital, high-resolution bathymetry data sets for the Lena Delta and Kolyma Gulf regions in northeastern Siberia. Based on nautical charts, we digitized depth points and isobath lines, which serve as an input for a 50 m bathymetry model. The benefit of this data set is the accurate mapping of near-shore areas as well as the offshore continuation of the main deep river channels. This will improve the estimation of river outflow and the nutrient flux output into the coastal zone.\n\nGreenland Geothermal Heat Flow Database and Map (Version 1)\n\nWilliam Colgan, Agnes Wansing, Kenneth Mankoff, Mareen LÃ¶sing, John Hopper, Keith Louden, JÃ¶rg Ebbing, Flemming G.

Kjeldsen, Dorthe Petersen, Ulrik Gregersen, Gregers Dam, Tove Nielsen, Shfaqat A. Khan, and Anja LÃ¸kkegaard\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 2209–2238, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2209-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2209-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assemble all available geothermal heat flow measurements collected in and around Greenland into a new database. We use this database of point measurements, in combination with other geophysical datasets, to model geothermal heat flow in and around Greenland. Our geothermal heat flow model is generally cooler than previous models of Greenland, especially in southern Greenland. It does not suggest any high geothermal heat flows resulting from Icelandic plume activity over 50 million years ago.\n\nExplicitly modelling microtopography in permafrost landscapes in a land surface model (JULES vn5.4_microtopography)\n\nNoah D. Smith, Eleanor J. Burke, Kjetil Schanke Aas, Inge H. J. Althuizen, Julia Boike, Casper Tai Christiansen, Bernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Thomas Friborg, Hanna Lee, Heather Rumbold, Rachael H. Turton, Sebastian Westermann, and Sarah E. Chadburn\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3603–3639, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3603-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3603-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic has large areas of small mounds that are caused by ice lifting up the soil. Snow blown by wind gathers in hollows next to these mounds, insulating them in winter. The hollows tend to be wetter, and thus the soil absorbs more heat in summer. The warm wet soil in the hollows decomposes, releasing methane. We have made a model of this, and we have tested how it behaves and whether it looks like sites in Scandinavia and Siberia. Sometimes we get more methane than a model without mounds.\n\nOrganic matter characteristics of a rapidly eroding permafrost cliff in NE Siberia (Lena Delta, Laptev Sea region)\n\nCharlotte Haugk, Loeka L. Jongejans, Kai Mangelsdorf, Matthias Fuchs, Olga Ogneva, Juri Palmtag, Gesine Mollenhauer, Paul J. Mann, P. Paul Overduin, Guido Grosse, Tina Sanders, Robyn E. Tuerena, Lutz Schirrmeister, Sebastian Wetterich, Alexander Kizyakov, Cornelia Karger, and Jens Strauss\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2079–2094, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2079-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2079-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBuried animal and plant remains (carbon) from the last ice age were freeze-locked in permafrost. At an extremely fast eroding permafrost cliff in the Lena Delta (Siberia), we found this formerly frozen carbon well preserved. Our results show that ongoing degradation releases substantial amounts of this carbon, making it available for future carbon emissions. This mobilisation at the studied cliff and also similarly eroding sites bear the potential to affect rivers and oceans negatively.\n\nStrong increase in thawing of subsea permafrost in the 22nd century caused by anthropogenic climate change\n\nStiig Wilkenskjeld, Frederieke Miesner, Paul P. Overduin, Matteo Puglini, and Victor Brovkin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1057–1069, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1057-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1057-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThawing permafrost releases carbon to the atmosphere, enhancing global warming. Part of the permafrost soils have been flooded by rising sea levels since the last ice age, becoming subsea permafrost (SSPF). The SSPF is less studied than the part on land. In this study we use a global model to obtain rates of thawing of SSPF under different future climate scenarios until the year 3000. After the year 2100 the scenarios strongly diverge, closely connected to the eventual disappearance of sea ice.\n\nNovel coupled permafrostâforest model (LAVESIâCryoGrid v1.0) revealing the interplay between permafrost, vegetation, and climate across eastern Siberia\n\nStefan Kruse, Simone M. Stuenzi, Julia Boike, Moritz Langer, Josias Gloy, and Ulrike Herzschuh\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2395–2422, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2395-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2395-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe coupled established models for boreal forest (LAVESI) and permafrost dynamics (CryoGrid) in Siberia to investigate interactions of the diverse vegetation layer with permafrost soils. Our tests showed improved active layer depth estimations and newly included species growth according to their species-specific limits. We conclude that the new model system can be applied to simulate boreal forest dynamics and transitions under global warming and disturbances, expanding our knowledge.\n\nTopoCLIM: rapid topography-based downscaling of regional climate model output in complex terrain v1.1\n\nJoel Fiddes, Kristoffer Aalstad, and Michael Lehning\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1753–1768, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1753-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1753-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study describes and evaluates a new downscaling scheme that addresses the need for hillslope-scale atmospheric forcing time series for modelling the local impact of regional climate change on the land surface in mountain areas. The method has a global scope and is able to generate all model forcing variables required for hydrological and land surface modelling. This is important, as impact models require high-resolution forcings such as those generated here to produce meaningful results.\n\nA new approach to simulate peat accumulation, degradation and stability in a global land surface scheme (JULES vn5.8_accumulate_soil) for northern and temperate peatlands\n\nSarah E. Chadburn, Eleanor J. Burke, Angela V. Gallego-Sala, Noah D. Smith, M. Syndonia Bret-Harte, Dan J. Charman, Julia Drewer, Colin W. Edgar, Eugenie S. Euskirchen, Krzysztof Fortuniak, Yao Gao, Mahdi Nakhavali, WÅodzimierz Pawlak, Edward A. G. Schuur, and Sebastian Westermann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1633–1657, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1633-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1633-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new method to include peatlands in an Earth system model (ESM). Peatlands store huge amounts of carbon that accumulates very slowly but that can be rapidly destabilised, emitting greenhouse gases. Our model captures the dynamic nature of peat by simulating the change in surface height and physical properties of the soil as carbon is added or decomposed. Thus, we model, for the first time in an ESM, peat dynamics and its threshold behaviours that can lead to destabilisation.\n\nIce Surface Velocity in the Eastern Arctic from Historical Satellite SAR Data\n\nTazio Strozzi, Andreas Wiesmann, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, Thomas Schellenberger, and Frank Paul\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-44,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-44, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge on surface velocity of glaciers and ice caps contributes to a better understanding of a wide range of processes related to glacier dynamics, mass change and response to climate. Based on the release of historical satellite radar data from various space agencies we compiled nearly complete mosaics of winter ice surface velocities for the 1990's over the Eastern Arctic. Compared to the present state, we observe a general increase of ice velocities along with a retreat of glacier fronts.\n\nPermafrost in monitored unstable rock slopes in Norway â new insights from temperature and surface velocity measurements, geophysical surveying, and ground temperature modelling\n\nBernd EtzelmÃ¼ller, Justyna Czekirda, Florence Magnin, Pierre-Allain Duvillard, Ludovic Ravanel, Emanuelle Malet, Andreas Aspaas, Lene Kristensen, Ingrid Skrede, Gudrun D.
