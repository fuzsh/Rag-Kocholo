A multistage cluster sampling was used to select, successively, census tracts, blocks, households, and residents in the age group 10–69 years in each state capital. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was lower than 1% in the north, southeast, and south regions.

        "text": "Discussion\n\nKnowledge of region- and age-specific prevalence of hepatitis B infection is important for evaluating vaccination programs and national disease prevention and control efforts. Our findings classify these regions as having low HBV endemicity, rather than the intermediate and high endemicity defined by previous studies in the last century and past decade. Nevertheless, the overall estimation of individuals chronically infected with HBV was 18,612, 43,367, and 12,624 in the north, southeast, and south, respectively.\n\nThe introduction of vaccination in these regions happened in different years and in different age groups. In the data collection period, vaccinated cohorts might have reached the age of 20 years. Note that in the north, area that was considered as having high prevalence, the vaccination status for participants over 20 years of age was significantly higher compared with the south and southeast regions.\n\nCountries with high prevalence of HVB infection that began universal immunization have shown decreased prevalence, as occurred in Taiwan,9,10 China,11,12 and Saudi Arabia.13 A reduction was also observed in low-endemicity countries, such as the United States14 and Canada.15\n\nIn Brazil, a population-based study in the western Amazon State, in a region called Labrea (where the association of hepatitis B and D virus infection was first identified), revealed a significant reduction in the HBsAg rate in the community, 11 years after the introduction of the HBV vaccination program, categorizing the area as intermediate endemicity (formerly classified as high).16\n\nOur data revealed a prevalence of HBsAg similar to the data for all capitals of the northeast, central-west regions, and in the federal capital.6\n\nAlthough population-based data for HBV infection before and after vaccination are not available for large areas, the low-endemicity level found strongly suggest an impact of the vaccination policy. The Brazilian National Immunization Program attained high vaccination coverage and sustainability as vaccines were freely supplied by the National Self-Sufficiency Program in Immunobiologicals.17\n\nRecent publication with the objective of estimating age-, sex-, and region-specific prevalence of chronic HBV infection in the world and calculate the absolute number of persons chronically infected, using an empirical Baysian hierarchical model, showed that from 1990 to 2005 the prevalence of chronic HBV infection decreased in most regions. Brazil was categorized as a region of low endemicity.18\n\nThe results of this survey indicate different patterns of HBV transmission in the areas studied. The factors independently associated with HBV infection in the north region were mainly related to the sexual route and to the use of drugs; in the southeast to the use of drugs; while in the south to the sexual route, use of drugs and also to the blood route. An inverse relationship with socioeconomic conditions (schooling) was found in the north and south regions. Use of drugs that were not related to the mechanism of transmission of HBV was also associated with seropositivity.\n\nAge was an independent predictor for HBV infection, as reported in the literature,19 indicating length of time for viral exposures and initiation of sexual activity. The increasing vaccine coverage of younger age groups may also have contributed to the difference in prevalence between the two age groups considered (10–19 and 20–69 years). Our study found higher risk of HBV infection in men only in the southeast region, like in the United States20 and in Brazilian studies with individuals recruited from restricted areas, volunteers, or outpatient clinics.21–23\n\nThe sexual behavior associated with exposure to HBV was not the same in the different regions. In the north, there was a greater chance of HBV infection for those whose partner had sex with individuals of the same sex, similar to what was found in the northeast.6 Male–male sexual activity24,25 and having a homosexual partner26 have been reported as risk factors for HBV infection in other studies. Individuals whose partners have sex with individuals of the same sex share, to some extent, the same risk factors of their partners. The association between the number of sexual partners and the positivity to serologic markers of hepatitis B (and other STDs) is often referred in Brazilian studies carried out either in blood centers27,28 or in general population29 or, still, in special groups.30,31\n\nThese sexual behaviors, found in the north and south regions, were probably related to unsafe sexual practices. The history of STD also expresses these practices. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has conducted several campaigns to promote responsible sexual behavior and has made condoms largely available.32 Further efforts could be done to deliver interventions and to conduct in-depth studies to target groups until the age group with high anti-HBV vaccination coverage gets older.\n\nIn the southeast, HBV infection was associated with the use of injected drugs; this association is well documented in the literature and in Brazilian studies.25,33 In the three regions, the use of non-injecting drugs was also associated with the presence of HBV infection. It is likely that in these settings non-injecting drug users are more prone to other risk behavior, which should be investigated to allow the choice of targeted control measures. The same rationale could be used to explain the association with heavy alcohol consumption in the southeast.\n\nSharing toothbrush was associated with HBV infection, inexplicably, in the region with higher Human Development Index. The association with history of blood transfusion and gastrointestinal endoscopy in the south should be interpreted with caution. As in Brazil the blood supply is adequately screened for hepatitis B since 1975, it is possible that either the transfusion occurred before this year or that the exposure to HBV occurred before the transfusion. Endoscopy-related transmission of HBV is rare.34 Quasi-experimental designs (before and after studies) could be performed to elucidate if blood transfusion and endoscopy still play any role in HBV transmission in southern Brazil.\n\nSchooling was associated with exposure to HBV in the south region. Risk behaviors related to the socioeconomic context could be identified to guide specific interventions. Sewage disposal was associated with HBV infection in the north and south regions, but the association was in opposite directions suggesting that the same situation (household with septic tank) may express different socioeconomic conditions in these two regions. The results for hepatitis C for the whole country showed that no sewage disposal, a marker of extreme poverty, was associated with anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence.35\n\nThe study has some limitations and strengths. The main strength is that it is a representative sample of the population aged 10–69 years of the ensemble of state capitals in the north, south, and southeast regions. However, the results may not be directly extrapolated to the residents of smaller cities or rural areas. Another limitation is temporal ambiguity, which is inherent to cross-sectional studies. Information bias, especially in relation to questions related to the use of drugs and sexual behavior, may have occurred but, as individuals did not know the results of their blood testing when interviewed, it was nonrandom, which may have decreased the magnitude of some of the associations found.\n\nThe findings presented herein highlight the diversity of the potential transmission routes for hepatitis B transmission in Brazil. In one hand, it reinforces the importance of national control strategies of large impact already in course such as the immunization of infants, adolescents, and adults up to 49 years of age and blood supply screening. On the other hand, it shows that there is still room for further control measures targeted to different groups within each region."
