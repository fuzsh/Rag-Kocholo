        "text": "This contribution intends to enlighten the dynamics of the process of ethnic-identitary construction of Italian immigrants and descendents in Brazil in the period between the two World Wars. In the context of the crisis of liberal institutions and of the ascent and consolidation of the Fascist totalitarianism, the construction of national identity represented a primary goal for Italian political and administrative summits. As part of the actions of intervention established for Italian schools abroad, we intend to explore one of the aspects of school cultures that received more attention by the liberal and Fascist ruling elites: the textbooks that would sustain the development of the national identity abroad. Our area of analysis is the large and complex one of Brazil, regarding which a specific attention developed precisely in the first years of the 1920s. Our contribution intends to verify the lines of continuity and discontinuity in terms of the policies adopted by the leaders of the Ministries for the diffusion of textbooks in Italian schools abroad, as well as in terms of the educational models proposed in the textbooks employed in Brazil, always aiming to support the Italian national identity during this significant moment of political transition. EET-TEE\n\nThe present contribution aims to focus on the intellectual and professional biography of the teacher Giovanni Lucaroni who worked for more than forty years in the primary school in Mogliano, near Macerata. Lucaroni – after the entry into force of the Reform of Education by Giovanni Gentile in 1923 – was increasingly inspired by the activist educational principles and practices promoted by Giuseppe Lombardo Radice in the primary school programs and started to test them in Mogliano. Thanks to extensive research both in his own archives and in the archives of the primary school in Mogliano, several publications by Lucaroni on the interpretation of the «new school» advocated by the Reform of Education and the diaries in which he told day by day the application of activist principles in his classroom will be presented. Moreover, the system of highly qualified intellectual relations – such as those with Alfredo Saraz and Giuseppe Lombardo Radice – will be reconstructed.\n\nThe history of childhood and childhood education has experienced, in Italy, a real development only in the last forty years. The reason of such a delay is due to several factors. First of all, the prevalence in the Italian historiography, until the seventies, of the ethical-political matrix derived from Hegel's idealism, which wasn't avoided not even by the Marxist historians. Secondly, the serious delay with which the historical-pedagogical research – for a too long period of time confined within the narrow limits of the history of pedagogical doctrines and of the philosophical theories of education-has developed its own cultural and epistemological identity and autonomy and the methodologies and conceptual frameworks typical of the historiographical research. This paper is based on the awareness that the history of childhood – for the «elusive» character of the object to be studied and for its being placed in a border area between different sectors and fields of research – involves a complex and structured approach,\n\nThe article examines the slow process of professionalization of elementary school teachers, from the fragmented educational reality of the old regime to the emergence of a teaching body with a specific preparation and a collective identity. The Italian Government played a significant role in this process by preparing teachers up to the task of fighting illiteracy and promoting people’s adherence to the new State fundamental values. Teaching, however, remained poorly paid and quite precarious and those aspects increased feminine recruitment: the job was considered a respectable and typically womanly occupation, even though the arrival of single girls in small provincial towns sometimes resulted into persecutions that found an echo in press and literature. The improvement of teachers’ cultural level fostered the development of a class consciousness. In the new century, combative associations developed; they obtained important results, but were undermined by deep internal divisions, which opposed men and women, urban and rural, catholic and secular teachers. Teachers were accused of defending corporative interests and neglecting the school system needs, and then called to order by the Gentile’s education reform, one of the first acts of Fascist rule.\n\nThe present overview International Bibliography of the history of education and children's literature about the year 2014 is the third of a serie, which has been published in 2012 and 2103 on the international journal «History of Education & Children's Literature» and concerned the four years period 2010-2012 and 2013; it was followed by the publication of two volumes about the same period. This specialized bibliographical overview includes researches and studies about the history of education edited around the world (articles published in journals, monographs, collections of essays, proceedings and textbooks). In order to build the present work tool, addressed in particular to the scholars of history of education and of children's literature, it was necessary to go systematically through an outstanding quantity of national and international specialized publishers' catalogues (historical studies, social and human sciences, educational sciences), as well as through the catalogues of almost 400 high specialized scientific reviews published in different countries of the world.\n\nThis work focuses on teachers’ memories and intend to dwell on the heuristic potential of this source category, comparing it with the traditional sources of theoretical-regulatory and educational type. After a presentation on the state of art of historical and historical-educational studies on teachers’ memories, it will offer an overview of the different kinds of memories preserved in the centres of documentation and research of historical and educational interest, examining the books and documentary heritage of the Centre for documentation and research on the history of schoolbooks and children’s literature of Macerata University. Finally, through the analysis of a case study, the Memorie (Memoirs) of the teacher and pedagogist Lorenzo Bettini (1855-1917), we will offer an exemplification of a possible integrated use of sources, for a plural reconstruction of teachers’ history.\n\nAstratto All'inizio degli anni Venti del Novecento in Italia, a cavallo tra la crisi delle istituzioni liberali e l'ascesa del fascismo, furono prodotti nuovi libri di testo per le scuole italiane all'estero al fine di sostenere il rilancio della politica per la difesa dell'italianità all'estero. Il contributo intende illustrare le vicende che portarono alla pubblicazione dei libri di lettura per le scuole elementari di Alarico Buonaiuti e di Francesco Pasciuti e Giovanni di Giusto destinati a circolare in Brasile, e un'analisi dei modelli educativi introdotti e proposti attraverso la nuova produzione editoriale veicolata dalle autorità italiane.
