        "text": "Portugal has undergone a significant process of change during the last 40 years. It has seen political transformation, marked by the end of 48 years of dictatorial rule and the consolidation of democracy. Economic and social change has taken place with Portugal, once a backward and socially underdeveloped country, becoming a devel- oped nation.The aim of this book is to present an introduction to that process of change and to examine it as part of the evolution of Portuguese politics and society since the beginning of the twentieth century. Written by historians, sociologists, political scientists and special- ists in literature and art, this book seeks to provide specialists, students and general readers a global view of contemporary Portugal. Essays written by Portuguese academics explore a broad spectrum of topics: the colonial empire, international relations, economic development, social change, gender issues, democratic consolidation, Portugal and the European Union, issues of national identity and a review of Por- tuguese contemporary literature and art.\n\nThe Portuguese 1974 revolution was initiated by the military, with huge popular support. The captains started the revolution, but then politicians took over. Mostly it was a top to bottom revolution. But in local government the people assumed control. Who were the local elites before the revolution and who took their place? Were these new elites validated by the elections? In order to compare local elites in Portugal during Salazar’s dictatorship and then in the Democratic regime, a database was built with over 6.000 entries regarding mayors and civil governors from 1936 to 2013. The main conclusions are that during the transition period there was almost complete elite replacement. A new group assumed local government, with new professions and new social background. The revolutionary period produced a participative group of people, who in fact assumed local government functions, but were not validated by the first democratic elections.\n\nIn inter-war European conservative circles, particularly those of the Catholics and those close to Action Française, António de Oliveira Salazar’s New State was praised as an example of a ‘good dictatorship’: one that avoided most of the totalitarian and pagan elements of Mussolini and Hitler. Salazar’s dictatorship and its political institutions have been the subject of wide-ranging interpretive debate and some dimensions challenge common assumptions about inter-war fascism. The first concerns its relatively long duration, surviving the ‘era of fascism’ and much of the Cold War, ending only some years after the natural and peaceful death of its dictator in the 1970s. The second and most important concerning its ability to adapt institutions that, while inspired by certain aspects of Italian Fascism, were shaped by the armed forces, the Catholic Church and other institutions.\n\nOn the eve of April 25 th , 1974 – date of the Gillyflowers Revolution –, Portugal was an anachronistic country. Last colonial empire in the Western world was fighting a war on three fronts in Africa, where the liberation movements were solidly supported by the Third World and was the face of successive condemnations in the UN and the discomfort of their traditional allies. Rare was the family that had no one fighting in Africa, the military service lasted four years, the public expression of opinion against the regime and against the war was severely repressed by the censorial apparatus and police, political parties and movements were prohibited, the prisons full of political prisoners, the opposition leaders exiled, strongly controlled unions, the strike prohibited, facilitated firings, cultural life tightly guarded. An anaesthesia that the Portuguese people was subject decades on end, despite the efforts of the opposition elites, along with the aggravating of social injustices and persistent economic and cultural backwardness, in a context that contributed to the identification between the dictatorial regime and the capitalist model of development itself, are largely responsible for the revolutionary euphoria that existed after April 25 th , during which Portugal tried to live the decades of European history that had been deprived by the dictatorial regime."
