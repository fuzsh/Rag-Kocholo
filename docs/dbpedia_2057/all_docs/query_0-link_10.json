As of summer 2002 the Senate has been unable to overcome an impasse that would permit it to vote on bills addressing research cloning. Consequently, the future of ES cell research in the US\n\nremains uncertain. ES and EG cell research offers the potential of great medical benefit, but it also raises difficult ethical issues and complicates policy development. This turbulent area of research will surely command our attention well into the\n\nnew millennium.\n\nP.

Bush was inaugurated as president of the United States on 20 Jan 2001. The 2000 presidential balloting exposed several deficiencies in the conduct of American elections: the possibility that a candidate could win more popular votes than his opponent and still lose the electoral college tally-Bush defeated Al Gore 271-266 despite winning 500,000 fewer votes nationwide; faulty and outdated election equipment—a General Accounting Office audit found that nearly three-fifths of voting sites had problems in toral\n\n2000; a lack of uniform rules for election recounts; and incorrect media projections; and confusing ballot design, most notably in Florida, where possibly thousands of people were early\n\nled to vote mistakenly for a\n\ncandidate. controversy,\n\nThe\n\nelection\n\ncoupled with\n\nthe collapse in late 2001 of energy services giant Enron, which had donated large\n\nboth\n\nsums\n\nof\n\nmoney\n\nto\n\npolitical parties, also\n\n4 £\n\nAlthough reform efforts seemed to stall in midin December the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved (362-63) a bill that provided some $2.6 billion in funds to states to modern-\n\n2001,\n\nize election\n\nequipment and establish national voting\n\nstandards, and in April 2002 the Senate passed (99-1) a modified version of the House package, providing about $3.5 billion to the states to implement national standards such as electronically notifying and allowing persons whose names were not on registration lists, but who claimed that they were registered, to cast a provisional ballot.

By mid-2002 the future of electoral reform was still uncertain. On the state level the most sweeping election reform package was adopted in Florida, the state that had endured a five-week standoff in the presidential election before Bush was declared the winner by a margin of onlv 537 votes after the Supreme Court halted a recount. On 9 May 2001 Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the brother of the president, approved a uniform statewide ballot design and the elimination punch cards in favor of optical scanners or other advanced technologies by 2002.

The changes, which were set to take place after the 2002 midterm elections, promised to radically alter how federal campaigns are conducted in the US.
