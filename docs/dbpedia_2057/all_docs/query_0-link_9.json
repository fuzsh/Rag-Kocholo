Gentlemen: I hav transferd to you as Trustees of the Carnegie Peace Fund, Ten Million Dollars of Five Per Cent. First Mortgage Bonds, the revenue of which is to be administerd by you to hasten the abolition of international war, the foulest blot upon our civilization. Altho we no longer eat our fellowmen nor torture prisoners, nor sack cities killing their inhabitants, we still kill each other in war like barbarians. Only wild beasts are excusable for doing that in this, the Twentieth Century of the Christian era, for the crime of war is inherent, since it decides not in favor of the right, but always of the strong. The nation is criminal which refuses arbitration and drives its adversary to a tribunal which knows nothing of righteous judgment. I believ that the shortest and easiest path to peace lies in adopting President Taft’s platform, who said in his address before the Peace and Arbitration So- ciety, New York, March 22, 1910: ‘T hav noticed exceptions in our arbitration treaties, as to reference of questions of national honor to courts of arbitration. Personally, I do not see any more reason why matters of national honor should not be referd to a court of arbitration than matters of property or of national proprietorship. I know that is going farther than most men are willing to go, but I do not see why questions of honor may not be submitted to a tribunal compxjsed of men of honor who understand questions of national honor, to abide by their decision, as well as any other questions of difference arising between nations.” I venture to quote from my address as President of the Peace Congress in New York, 1907: “Honor is the most dishonord word in our language. No man ever touched another man’s honor; no nation ever dishonord another nation; all honor’s wounds are self-inflicted.” At the opening of the International Bureau of American Republics at Wash- ington, April 26, 1910, President Taft said: “We twenty-one republics can not afford to hav any two or any three of us quarrel. We must stop this, and Mr. Carnegie and I will not be satisfied until all nineteen of us can intervene by proper mesures to suppress a quarrel between any other two.” I hope the Trustees will begin by pressing forward upon this line, testing it thoroly and douting not. The judge who presides over a case in which he is interested dies in infamy if discovered. The citizen who constitutes himself a judge in his own cause as against his fellow-citizen, and presumes to attack him, is a law-breaker and as 2 CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE such disgraced. So should a nation be held as disgraced which insists upon sit- ting in judgment in its own cause in case of an international dispute. I call your attention to the following resolution introduced by the Com- mittee of Foreign Relations in the first Session, Fiftieth Congress, June 14, 1888: Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), that the President be, and is hereby, requested to invite, from time to time, as fit occasions may arise, negotiations with any government with which the United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or disputes arising between the two governments which can not be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means [resolution not reached on calendar dur- ing session, but reintroduced and passed: Senate, February 14, 1890; House, April 3, 1890.] This resolution was presented to the British Parliament, which adopted a resolution approving the action of the Congress of the United States and ex- pressing the hope that Her Majesty’s Government would lend their ready co- operation to the Government of the United States for the accomplishment of the object in view [Resolution of the House of Commons, July 16, 1893, Foreign Relations, 1893, 346, 352]. Here we find an expression of the spirit which resulted in the first inter- national Hague Conference of 1899; the second Hague Conference of 1907; and eighty treaties of obligatory arbitration between the great nations of the world, our own country being a party to twenty-three of them. It was my privilege to introduce to President Cleveland in 1887 a Com- mittee of Members of the Parliament of Britain, hedded by Sir William Randal Cremer, in response to the action of Congress, proposing a treaty agreeing to settle all disputes that mite arise between America and Great Britain by arbi- tration. Such a treaty was concluded between Lord Pauncefote and Secretary Olney in 1897. It faild of approval by the necessary two-thirds majority of the Senate by only three votes. There is reason to believ that the British Government has been desirous of having that treaty ratified by our Government or redy to agree to another of similar character, so that President Taft’s policy seems within easy reach of success. If the English-speaking race adopts such a treaty we shall not hav to wait long for other nations to join, and it will be noticed that the resolution of Congress in 1890 embraces ‘‘any government with which the United States has or may hav diplomatic relations.” If the independence and rights of nations to their respectiv internal policies were first formally recognized in such treaties, no dispute concerning these ele- ments of sovereignty could arise. In order to giv effect to this gift, it will be suitable that the Trustees herein named shall form a corporation with lawful powers appropriate to the accom- plishment of the purposes herein exprest and I authorize the conveyance of the fund to such a corporation. MR. Carnegie’s letter to the trustees 3 The Trustees hav power to sell, invest, or re-invest all funds, either in the United States or in other countries, subject as respects investments in the United States to no more restriction than is imposed upon savings banks or insurance companies in the State of New York. No personal liability will attach to Trustees for their action or nonaction as Trustees. They may act as a Board. They hav power to fill vacancies or to add to theii number and to employ all officials and to fix their compensation whether members of the Board or not. Trustees shall be reimbursed all ex- penses incurd in connection with their duties as Trustees, including traveling ex- penses attending meetings, including expenses of wife or daiiter to each annual meeting. A majority of the Trustees may act for the whole. The President shall be granted such honoraria as the Trustees think proper and as he can be prevaild upon to accept. Lines of future action can not be wisely laid down. Many may hav to be tried, and having full confidence in my Trustees I leav to them the widest dis- cretion as to the mesures and policy they shall from time to time adopt, only premising that the one end they shall keep unceasingly in view until it is attained, is the speedy abolition of international war between so-cald civilized nations. When civilized nations enter into such treaties as named, £ind war is dis- carded as disgraceful to civilized men as personal war (duelling) and man sell- ing and buying (slavery) hav been discarded within the wide boundaries of our English-speaking race, the Trustees will pleas then consider what is the next most degrading rem^iining evil or evils whose banishment — or what new elevating element or elements if introduced, or fostered, or both combined — would most advance the progress, elevation and happiness of man, and so on from century to century without end, my Trustees of each age shall determin how they can best aid man in his upward march to higher and higher stages of development unceasingly; for now we know that man was created, not with an instinct for his own degradation, but imbued with the desire and the power for improvement to which, perchance, there may be no limit short of perfection even here in this life upon erth. Let my Trustees therefore ask themselvs from time to time, from age to age, how they can best help man in his glorious ascent onward and upward and to this end devote this fund. Thanking you for your cordial acceptance of this trust and your harty approval of its object, I am Very gratefully yours, Andrew Carnegie. Witness : Louise Whitfield Carnegie. Margaret Carnegie. ACCEPTANCE OF THE GIFT On the date of Mr. Carnegie’s letter, the Board of Trustees designated by him, met in Washington, and Mr. Choate addressed Mr. Carnegie and the mem- bers of the Board as follows : Mr. President, I suppose the first business in order would be the formal acceptance of this remarkable gift from Mr. Carnegie. It is impossible for me, or I think for anyone, to find adequate words to express our apprecia- tion and gratitude for this wonderful gift. Mr. Carnegie has been known for many years now as a great benefactor to his race and the whole civilized world is covered with proofs of his beneficence. Great trusts that he has established for the benefit of mankind have already demonstrated the wis- dom of his designs and his gifts; but in this enterprise for peace which he has undertaken, he has in my judgment attempted the most difficult, as well as the most far reaching and beneficent, of all his works. Twenty years ago such a proposition as he has made in the remarkable paper that he has read would have been received with wonder and incre- dulity, and would have been regarded as hopeless and impossible; but enor- mous progress has been made in those twenty years, and very largely by his personal influence. Twelve years ago, when the Emperor of Russia first proposed that the nations of the earth should assemble by their accredited representatives to consider the question of peace and disarmament or mitiga- tion and regulation of armament, the proposition was received almost with contempt in many countries of the world; but when that body assembled — there is nobody who can tell us better than Dr. White about that — it made immense progress in the direction of peace and harmony among nations. Eight years afterwards, when under your direction, Mr. Chairman, we went again to The Hague for the same purpose, rstill further progress was made, and by the result of those two assemblages, as the result also of the cultiva- tion of public opinion in favor of peace, among all civilized nations, this pro- posed gift of Mr. Carnegie is not only made possible but the promise of it is to my mind absolutely certain. At the same time I think it may be regarded as the most difficult work that he has yet entrusted to any board of trustees or has himself undertaken. That it is sure to come in the end, no reasonable man can doubt; but anyone who has attempted any work in this direction knows the enormous difficul- ties that lie in the way, in the prejudices, the interests and the determination of the various great nations of the world. I will not attempt to enlarge upon the subject. I am sure that we shall devote our best endeavors to carry out the object that Mr. Carnegie has expressed in his letter of gift, and that among our first objects will certainly be to promote what he has evidently so much at heart, and what he is so absolutely assured will be hailed with cordial welcome on the other side of the border — the ratification of the treaty that he has referred to between England and the United States — for I am satisfied that if those two nations are bound together in terms of 4 ACCEPTANCE OF THE GIFT 5 lasting friendship and peace it would go far to secure the peace of the whole world. I therefore offer this resolution of acceptance: Resolved y That the Trust Fund, for the promotion of peace, speci- fied in the instrument subscribed to and delivered this day by Mr. Andrew Carnegie be and it is hereby accepted for the purposes pre- scribed by the donor. Resolvedy That in undertaking to hold and use, in trust, this munifi- cent gift for the benefit of mankind, the Trustees are moved by a deep sense of the sincere and noble spirit of humanity which inspires the donor of the Fund. They feel that all thoughtful men and women should be grateful to him, and should be glad to aid, so far as lies within their power, towards the accomplishment of the much-to-be-desired end upon which he has fixed his hopes, and to which he desires to contribute. Thev are not unmindful of the delicacy and difficulty involved in dealing with so great a sum, for such a purpose, wisely and not mischievously, and in ways which shall be practical and effective. They accept the Trust in the belief that, although, doubtless, many mistakes may be made, great and permanent good can be accomplished. The Secretary, at the direction of the Chairman, called the name of each Trustee, in order that the Trust might be accepted personally by each Trustee present, and the resolution was unanimously adopted. The Chairman then declared that by these acceptances the persons present were constituted Trustees under the instrument of the gift, with the powers and obligations specified therein.

R. 32084, '‘To incorporate the Carnegie Endowment for Inter- national Peace”], and laid before the Trustees of this association on the ninth day of March, 1911, with such alterations and amendments thereto as may be imposed by Congress and are not, in. the judgment of the Executive Committee, inconsistent with the effective prosecution of the purposes of the association. 14 CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE Upon the granting of such charter the property and business of the asso- ciation shall be transferred to the corporation so formed and a meeting of the Trustees shall be called for the purpose of regulating and directing the further conduct of the business by the corporation. SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE To THE Board of Trustees OF THE Carnegie Endowment for International Peace : The Executive Committee has the honor to report, pursuant to Article VII, Section 3, of the By-Laws, that it has held two meetings since the annual meeting of the Trustees in May Lst, namely, a meeting on May 10, immediately upon the adjournment of the Trustees, and a meeting on October 19, 1928. The minutes of both of these meetings have been printed and distributed to the Trus- tees, and a further detailed report from the Executive Committee is therefore not necessary at this time. Three vacancies have occurred in the Board of Trustees since the last annual meeting. The membership of Messrs. Lowden and Percy terminated at that meet- ing by the operation of Section 3 of Article I of the By-Laws, which reads: ‘Tn case any Trustee shall fail to attend three successive annual meetings of the Board, he shall thereupon cease to be a Trustee. ’’ The Honorable Robert Lansing, Vice President of the Endowment, died on October 30, 1928. In addition to these three recent vacancies, the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Oscar S. Straus has not as yet been filled. Inasmuch as the By-Laws provide that this special meeting of the Board of Trustees shall be for the transaction of such business as the Board shall deter- mine upon, including any special appropriations that may be found necessary, no formal program will be presented for consideration, but the Trustees will be free to propose, discuss and take such action upon any subject that they may determine upon. The formal recommendations of the officers and committees of the En- dowment will be reserved for the annual meeting in May. Respectfully submitted, James Brown Scott, Secretary, Washington, D. C., December 2^ IQ28. 15 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE To THE Board of Trustees OF THE Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: Pursuant to Article VII, Section 3, of the By-Laws, the Executive Committee has the honor to submit an annual report to the Board of Trustees. Since the last annual meeting of the Board of Trustees the Executive Com- mittee has held four meetings: May 10, October 19 and December 6, 1928; and April 5, 1929. At these various meetings allotments were made from the appro- priations voted by the Board of Trustees at its annual meeting of May 10, 1928, as recommended by the Secretary and the Directors of the Divisions. At the semi- annual meeting of December 6, 1928, an addition of sixty thousand dollars was voted to the contingency appropriation. This report of the Committee does not give a summary of the various allot- ments, as they are contained in detail in the minutes of the Committee meetings heretofore sent to the Trustees, and the allotments are also listed in the Report of the Treasurer, which is submitted to the Board of Trustees at its present meeting. As required by Article X, Section 2, of the By-Laws, the Committee has caused the accounts of the Endowment to be audited by skilled public accountants ap- pointed by the President ; their report will be submitted at the present meeting of the Board of Trustees. The requirements for the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1930, were duly taken up by the Committee at its meeting of April 5, 1929, and detailed estimates were mailed to each member of the Board of Trustees at the time stipulated in the By-Laws. The bonds of the United States Steel Corporation heretofore held by the Endowment have now been exchanged for other securities, with a net gain in the Endowment fund of $1,155,168.12 which includes a small uninvested balance in the bank, as shown in detail in the Report of the Treasurer. The present fund of the Endowment is, therefore, $11,155,168.12. At the annual meeting of the Endowment held on May 10, 1928, the Trustees referred to the Executive Committee “with power” the question of the incor- poration of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Act, signed by the Governor of New York on February 20, 1929, was spread upon the min- utes of the Committee, and the Executive Committee directed that the act of incorporation should be laid before the Board of Trustees at its annual meeting. There are two vacancies at present in the Board due to the deaths of Oscar S. Straus (May 3, 1926) and Robert Lansing (October 30, 1928). In addition the Trustees will be called upon to elect a President, Vice President, three members 16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 1 7 of the Finance Committee, and two members of the Executive Committee, be- cause of the expiration of terms of office. The Annual Meeting of the Board of Trustees was, pursuant to the By- Laws, called for the Thursday next after the first Monday in May, the ninth of the month, at the headquarters of the Endowment, 2 Jackson Place, at 10:30 o’clock a.m. Pursuant to previous understanding, however, the meeting was adjourned to New York on Tuesday morning. May 14, in order to proceed to the consideration of the incorporation and other business of the Endowment. Respectfully submitted, James Brown Scott, Secretary. Washington, D. C., May 14, iQ2g. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY To THE Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: The Secretary has the honor to submit the following report on the work of his office since the last annual meeting of the Trustees. The administrative duties of the Secretary, consisting of the supervision of the general work of the Endowment, the conduct of its correspondence, and the care of the property entrusted to his custody, have been performed in the usual manner and as more specifically outlined in previous reports. As Secretary ex officio of the Board of Trustees and of the Executive Committee, he has issued the calls for, arranged the agendas, prepared the business and written the minutes, of the meetings of the Board of Trustees on May lo and December 6, 1928, and of the Executive Committee on May 10, October 19 and December 6, 1928, and April 5, 1929. In connection with the countersignature of checks by the Secretary, he has supervised the keeping of the books of account, audited the bills submitted for payment, and verified against the appropriations of the Trustees and the allot- ments of the Executive Committee the authority for making disbursements for the payment of all vouchers. He has also kept a record and verified the trans- actions of the Finance Committee in its dealings with the funds and securities representing the capital of the Endowment. The report of the Treasurer, which is submitted to the Trustees herewith, contains the following information taken from the books kept in the Secretary's Office, covering the fiscal year ended June 30, 1928: Balance sheet showing assets and liabilities in the total sum of $11,399,432.68; a schedule of the securities representing the capital of the Endow- ment amounting to $10,472,305, and a small cash balance in the capital account amounting to $8,488.12; a statement of receipts and disbursements involving transactions amounting to $1,033,930.91; statements of the appropriations and allotments showing that of the $948,044.57 appropriated by the Trustees, the Executive Committee allotted $927,135.57, leaving unallotted of the appropria- tions a balance of $20,910. The statement also shows that of the sums allotted by the Executive Committee expenditures were made totalling $708,365.67, leaving unexpended of the allotments a balance of $218,768.90. The Treasurer’s report shows that the Endowment started the fiscal year 1928 on July I, 1927, with a balance on hand amounting to $327,153.29, to which was later added sundry refunds amounting to $283.07. The current in- come during the fiscal year consisted of interest on the Endowment’s capital funds and securities, interest on bank deposits, and subscriptions, all of which Financial statement 19 20 CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE amounted to $556,494.55. To this was added a grant of $150,000 from the Car- negie Corporation, making the total receipts for the fiscal year $1,033,930.91. Disbursements were made against these funds as follows: Secretary’s Office and general administration, $53,886.65; sundry purposes, $19,733.53; Division of Intercourse and Education, $378,868.96; Division of International Law, $160,- 224.43; Division of Economics and History, $32,809.51; Economic and Social History of the World War, $62,842.59; making the total disbursements $708,- 365.67, and leaving a balance on hand at the end of the fiscal year of $325,565.24> or approximately the same balance in bank with which the fiscal year started. The expenditures for the fiscal year 1928 were therefore almost exactly equal to the income received during that period. The increase in the current income above noted is due to the redemption of the United States Steel Corporation bonds, in which Mr. Carnegie’s original gift to the Endowment was made, and the reinvestment of the proceeds in other se- curities. The exchange of these securities had not been completed at the end of the fiscal year 1928. During the current fiscal year, the Finance Committee has substantially completed the exchange, and the result has added $1,155,168.12 to the capital account of the Endowment, with an increase of about $75,000 per annum in the current income. The Secretary prepared and issued the Year Book for 1928, v/hich is the official account to the public of the activities of the Endowment in all its branches. Publications Year Book contains reprints of the documents relating to the foundation and organization of the Endowment, a complete list of its Trustees, officers and committees, and the Annual Reports of the Secretary and the Directors of the three Divisions made to the Board of Trustees. The Year Book also contains a statement of the financial condition of the Endowment, as shown in the report of the Treasurer, a complete list of all the publications of the Endowment, and a list of the libraries and institutions in which these publications are deposited for free use. The Year Book may be obtained by anyone interested in the work of the Endowment upon application to the Secretary. An edition of 5,000 copies is printed, the bulk of which is immediately mailed to addresses on a permanent mailing list. The Secretary’s Office has general supervision of the arrangements for the printing and distribution of the publications issued by the three Divisions. A detailed account of such publications will be found in the report of the Directors of the Divisions, but in order that the Trustees may conveniently find in one place an account of all the publication activities of the Endowment, the Secretary here reports that during the calendar year 1928 five publications were issued in the Division of International Law, and twenty publications in the Division of Eco- nomics and History. The publications of the Division of Intercourse and Educa- tion consist mainly of the monthly pamphlet of documentary material known as International Conciliation^ a statement as to which is contained in the report of the Director of that Division. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21 The 1928 publications of the Division of International Law were the Pro- ceedings of the Third Conference of Teachers of International Law; the work of Pufendorf, entitled De officiis hominis et civis juxta legem naturalem libri duo,, published in the Classics of International Law; a French translation of the German work by Liszt, entitled Das Volkerrecht Systematisch DargestelU; two volumes of the work in Spanish by Mr. Gonzalez-Hontoria, entitled Tratado de derecho internacional piihlico; and a new number in the pamphlet series of the Division containing the lectures by Dr. Nicolas Politis, entitled The New Aspects of In- ternational Law.

Gratz and Schuller: The Economic Policy of Austria-Hungary during the War. 22 CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE The Secretary is, and has always been, firmly convinced that the publication of authentic material of an international character bearing upon the objects of the Endowment is one of the most useful means of accomplishing the Endowment’s purposes. The effect of such work is not limited to the occasion or to the persons involved. Publications of this character are permanent contributions upon which returns in the form of producing the results desired by the Trustees may in some cases continue to accrue indefinitely. Tangible results of such work are not easily obtainable, but there are exceptions to this as to all other rules. The Secretary has had the pleasure on a previous occasion to inform the Trustees of the testimony of some of the prominent delegates to the Conference at Washington on the Limitation of Armaments and Pacific Questions, as to the value to the members of that conference and in the accomplishment of its results of the two- volume work of the Division of International Law edited by the Honorable J. V. A. MacMurray, now American Minister to China, entitled Treaties and Agree- ments with and concerning China, i8Q4-igiQ. The Secretary is now happy to report another instance where a publication of the Endowment has served a very useful and practical purpose. The following extracts from a letter addressed to the Secretary by General Frank McCoy, the personal representative sent to Nicaragua by President Coolidge to supervise the Nicaraguan elections under agreement with the Government of that country, are self-explanatory : Dear Dr. Scott: Department of State, Washington, March 6, ig2Q. When I was given a mission a year and a half ago to go to Nicaragua as the personal representa- tive of the President, I found myself very ignorant of the background and history of Central America. I had never visited the country, and , . . hungered for a real sizing up of the situation there. That I found in Dr. Dana Munro's “The Five Republics of Central America,” published by your institution. I had considerable trouble in finding a copy of this book that I could take with me. ... But finally, through your courtesy, I was able to carry off with me your one library copy, which I used throughout my stay in Nicaragua, not only for my own use and work, in which it was of great value, but I sent it around by airplane to my assistants in the outlying provinces in Nicaragua. All of them read it with great interest and keen pleasure. Now to your surprise I send it back, much the worse for wear, but having done its duty like a good soldier. Since you have been so thoughtful as to publish a new edition, this old warrior can stand shoulder to shoulder on the book shelf, and there rest in peace. Faithfully yours, Frank McCoy. During the year ended December 31, 1928, there were distributed gratuitously through the Secretary’s Office 24,487 publications divided according to the office Distribution of follows: Secretary’s Office, 5,282; Division of Intercourse publications Education, 457; Division of International Law, 6,198; Division of Economics and History, 12,550. A detailed statement con- cerning this distribution is appended hereto. For completeness, the statement ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23 also shows the number of Endowment books sold through the various publishers during the same period. The sales through publishers are confined to the more or less technical works of the Division of International Law and the Division of Economics and History. A generous part of these editions is supplied free of charge to libraries for general use, and the remainder turned over to the publishers for sale at nominal prices to supply, through the usual channels of trade, individuals who may desire to acquire these technical volumes for their private use. For the purpose of continuing the annual accumulation of figures summarizing the publication activities of the Endowment from its organization, the following tabular statement is here inserted: Summary of Sales and Gratuitous Distribution of Endowment Publications from J911 TO 1928, Inc.

The addition of 23 new depositories Libraries during the last calendar year brought the total on the list up to 915. The new libraries added to the list were less than half of those which applied. During the year, the Secretary received and submitted to the Executive Com- mittee for its action 57 applications to be placed upon the depository list. Those which were acted upon favorably are as follows: Library of the World Peace Foundation, Boston, Massachusetts. Parmly Billings Memorial Library, Billings, Montana. School of Commerce Library of New York University, New York City. St. Lawrence University Library, Canton, New York. Hayes Memorial Library, Fremont, Ohio. Franklin and Marshall College Library, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. School of Slavonic Studies, University of London.

Bibliotheque de Tlnstitut de Droit International, Lausanne, Switzerland. Johnson Institutet f 5 r International Roett, Universitetat Upsala, Upsala, Sweden. Library of the Communist Academy, Moscow, Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. Institute Hispano-Cubano, Seville, Spain. As was pointed out in the Secretary’s last Annual Report, the libraries of foreign countries are now taking more active interest in applying for the Endowment’s publications and again this year the new additions to the list are largely in foreign countries. Of the foregoing 23 new depositories, only 6 are located in the United States, the remaining 17 being distributed among Canada, England, France, Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Union of South Africa. A complete list of the depository libraries, arranged by countries, is trans- mitted with this report. During the calendar year 1928, 2,656 new volumes were added to the Library and promptly cataloged. Mimeographed lists of these accessions were sent every The Library weeks to members of the Endowment’s staff, and to 48 outside libraries and individuals. On December 31, 1928, the total number of cataloged volumes in the Library was 40,050. Unbound volumes to the num- ber of 487 were permanently bound, and 613 pamphlets preserved in library binders. Reading lists in the numbered mimeographed series were compiled as follows : No. 2 1 , International Arbitration (14 pages) ; No. 22, Conscription of Men, Material, Resources, and Money in Time of War, with Select References on Compulsory Military Service (6 pages); No. 23, Disarmament, a Select List of Recent Pub- lications (10 pages); No. 24, Central-American Court of Justice (5 pages); No. 25, International American Conferences (20 pages). Shorter reading lists were prepared on the League of Nations, Government in the United States and Eng- land, and the Disarmament Proposal of Soviet Russia. During the year 1928 a total of 2,263 copies of reading lists were distributed, and it was difficult to keep a sufficient supply on hand to meet the many requests ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25 received. Important public libraries and organizations engaged in activities related to the Endowment's often request considerable numbers of copies of certain lists, but, owing to the limited supply, the Endowment is now unable to furnish these lists in quantity. The constant demand for these reading lists is evidence of the usefulness of this function of the Library. In view of the large amount of time required of the clerical force to make mimeographed stencils and run off large numbers of copies, especially when more than one edition is necessary, it is believed that it would be more satisfactory to print such lists in the future in such quantities as will enable the Endowment to supply all reasonable demands for them. An item to provide for such printing has been added to the estimates for the Library. The Endowment's Library was one of 225 cooperating libraries in the com- pilation of the monumental work entitled Union List of Serials in the Libraries of the United States and Canada, -whida was published in 1927 in a volume of 1,588 pages, and is considered to be the most significant cooperative work ever under- taken by American libraries. The Library is now cooperating in a similar under- taking of a List of Serial Publications of Foreign Governments since 1813. The Chronicle of International Events, which has been sufficiently described in previous reports, continues to be kept up to date, and provides an immediate answer to many queries received by the Endowment in regard to events of this character, including international conferences, diplomatic negotiations, arbitra- tions, and the status of treaties. The Endowment’s carefully selected Library of special topics, its scientific catalogue with its numerous analytical entries, and the familiarity of the Library personnel with reference books and resources of not only the Endowment's Library but of other libraries, enable the Endowment to give satisfactory information in response to nearly all inquiries received, of which there is now a constant stream from many and various sources. The Library maintains relations of most helpful cooperation with other or- ganizations. The League of Nations sends it nearly all of its publications, and through the courtesy of friends in Congress, a more or less complete supply of United States Government documents relating to international affairs are re- ceived without cost, including the Congressional Record and the Congressional Directory, hearings and reports, as well as numerous other books and pamphlets. The Mexican Foreign Office has also been very generous in sending its documents. Of the volumes added to the Library last year, 789 were received through gift. One of these donations deserves special acknowledgment. Dr. Ellery C. Stowell, of American University, Washington, presented the Library with 140 volumes of the Yellow Books of the French Foreign Office. These volumes are very valuable and hard to obtain, and the Secretary wishes to record, on behalf of the Endow- ment, his great appreciation of Dr. Stowell’s gift. The relations of the Endowment's Library with the Library of Congress are especially mutually helpful. Many publications are received by the Endowment’s Library which are not suited to its special purposes. These, and unusable dupli- 26 CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE cates, are usually donated by the Endowment to the Library of Congress. The Endowment's Library also supplies information to the Library of Congress for use in its card distribution work. In appreciation of this service, the Library of Congress has informed the Endowment that no charge will hereafter be made for the Library of Congress cards supplied for the Endowment’s catalogue, and that they will be supplied to the Endowment in the same way as they are supplied to the United States Government Departments that cooperate actively in the print- ing of the cards. The Endowment has heretofore paid for this service about $ioo a year. The Secretary is happy to report that the Librarian of the Endowment, M. Alice Matthews, has been appointed a member of the International Relations Committee of the American Library Association, and, as such, has been designated one of the official delegates from the American Library Association to the Interna- tional Library and Bibliographical Congress to be held in Rome in June next. The Secretary has been very glad to grant permission to the Librarian to represent the Endowment’s Library at that conference. The plans for the trip include visits to libraries in other cities of Italy. While abroad, the Librarian will visit the Li- brary of the League of Nations and the Endowment’s library in Paris. The Secretary’s Office was called upon during the year to extend the hospital- ity of the Endowment to a number of visitors to Washington who were interested in the Endowment’s activities. Two formal entertainments deserve Entertainment mention. The Sixty-second Annual Session of the National Grange was held in Washington November 14-23, 1928. The Grange consists of nearly 8,000 local units spanning the country from coast to coast, with a member- ship of nearly 60,000. While the Grange is the spokesman of the farmer and his industry, it “finds its supreme mission in the mental and moral development of its membership, stimulating their individual growth and improvement, to the end that they in turn may become more useful citizens of the Republic.” At the suggestion of Mr. Charles S. Hamlin, one of the Trustees, the Endowment de- cided to take advantage of this meeting to inform the membership of this country- wide organization of the Endowment’s purposes and activities. A dinner was accordingly offered to the officers and delegates representing the State granges on the evening of Tuesday, November 20. Some one hundred guests accepted the invitation, and enjoyed a mutually profitable evening together. Mr. Hamlin presided on behalf of the Endowment, and appropriate addresses were made by the Honorable J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Underseeretary of State, Honorable Roy A. Young, Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr. Louis J. Taber, Master of the National Grange. Mr. Taber, speaking on the subject of “The Grange and Peace,” pointed out the services which his organization had rendered to this cause in the past, and the peculiar interest which the farmer has in the maintenance of peace. He spoke in part as follows: Few institutions have rendered a more outstanding service along a line that is not particularly and peculiarly the purpose for which they were created than has our organization. In its very in- VISITING BRITISH JOURNALISTS AT THE TOMB OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, MOUNT VERNON, NOVEMBER 21, 1928 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 27 ception the first undertaking of the Grange was to break down sectionalism and national mis- understanding. In 1 873, 1 874 and 1 875 men who had worn the blue and men who had worn the gray, officers in the Union army and officers in the Confederate army which had clashed at Gettysburg and had met at Appomattox, met in the councils of this great fraternity and obliterated, so far as agriculture was concerned, sectionalism, brought safety and peace to the agricultural life of the nation, and wiped out the bitterness and the difficulties that war had left. The Grange proclaimed the gospel of internal peace. We believed there should be no north, no south, no east, and no west, as far as agriculture was concerned. It was natural and logical that we should take another step forward. Thus the Grange was planted across the northern boundary of the United States. The Dominion Grange had its birth, and no organization has rejoiced more in the great accomplish- ments of the Grange in the United States and Canada, as giving to the world an example of the longest boundary line in human history unprotected by armament than the two greatest nations of the world with a long contiguous boundary that have spent never a dollar for protection of the one against aggression from the other. It is equally admitted that Canada and the United States are the two most prosperous contiguous nations in the world. Then the Grange has gone a step still further. It was David Lubin, a Grange-trained farmer from California, who knocked at the doors of national diplomacy, like Christopher Columbus as it were, for years and finally attracted the attention of the young King of Italy, as a result of which 62 nations of the world have declared in favor of an agreement involving the interests of agriculture in an international way. This group has rendered service and will render a still larger service to mankind along the pathway of peace. The Grange believes in peace for moral and spiritual rea- sons. The Grange believes in the substitution of arbitration and adjudication for force, because of moral and spiritual power. But the farmer peculiarly of all groups appreciates the burdens that war leaves upon us. Let us take the figures of the United States Bureau of the Census and compare the survey of 1920 with the survey of 1925 with the probable adjustment of today. We are startled to find that the de- flation that has taken place in American agriculture, with the decline in income in the eight-year period for the American farmer, is greater than the total cost of America's participation in the World War. When we can find one industry which in its sacrificial contribution equals the total cost of the conflict, we can measure another reason why agriculture stands valiantly, vigorously, and positively for peace. We rejoice, Mr. Secretary, that under the leadership of that great and illustrious statesman, Frank B. Kellogg, a great step forward has been taken. We believe that the Kellogg treaties for peace have their roots in the hearts and minds of humanity. They represent the concrete aspira- tions of the human race for peace. I join with Mr. Hamlin in earnestly hoping that the Senate of the United States will set the example by speedily ratifying those treaties and also by seeking if there is a way whereby they can find that this nation can adhere to the World Court and yet leave to America the right to be the sole judge of its own conscience in the problems of international relations and self-defense. The second formal entertainment was rather more extended, lasting through the week of November 18-24. It was the occasion of the visit to Washington of the British journalists at the end of their two months’ tour of the United States as guests of the Endowment. A general account of the entire trip is contained in the report of the Director of the Division of Intercourse and Education, under whose auspices the visit was planned and carried out. When the journalists reached Washington they were placed in charge of the Secretary’s Office, which had planned a week’s program of visits and entertainment. On Sunday, November 18, the party was taken on an automobile trip around the city and through its beautiful parks. On the following day, the visitors were presented to President 28 CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE Coolidge by the British Ambassador and were afterwards received by the Secre- tary of State. On the same day, visits were made to the Capitol and the Library of Congress. Luncheon was served by the Overseas Writers, and in the evening a reception was held at the National Press Club ’ On Tuesday, November 20, the visiting journalists were accorded the privilege of attending a press conference with President Coolidge at the Executive Offices. They afterward lunched at the British Embassy. On Wednesday, November 21, the party was taken to Mount Vernon, where they visited the tomb of George Washington and his beautiful ancestral home overlooking the Potomac River. On the return trip to the city, the National Cemetery at Arlington was visited, where the British journalists placed a wreath upon the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. That afternoon a visit was made to the National Episcopal Cathedral, in course of construction, where the visitors were received by the Bishop of Washington. On the following day, visits were made to the National Museum and the Smithsonian Institution, and the visitors were guests at luncheon of the Washington branch of the English- , Speaking Union. That evening the journalists were the guests of the Endowment at dinner. On Friday, November 23, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Pan American Union were visited. Luncheon was offered by the United States Chamber of Commerce, and a tea at the Canadian Legation in the afternoon ended the formal program. On the following morning, the visitors departed to finish their tour at Philadelphia and New York. In all the public and private buildings visited in Washington, the journalists were most cordially received and given the opportunity of viewing thoroughly the work of those places. The directing officer of each establishment received the party and they were escorted through the various bureaus and sec- tions by the chief in charge of the particular work.
