He joined the Somali Youth Club (later called the Somali Youth League [SYL]) in February 1944, became a member of the party's steering board, and in 1946 was appointed secretary of the Beledweyne section of the party. In 1951 the Regional Council of Mudug designated him for the Territorial Council on which he served until February 1956 as the representative of the SYL. In 1953 he was appointed vice-president of the Territorial Council. In 1954-56 and 1958-60 he was president of the SYL. In 1956, when the Territorial Council was replaced by the Legislative Assembly, he was elected member for Beledweyne district at the general elections, and the Legislative Assembly appointed him its president. He maintained this post when the Legislative Assembly was converted into the Constituent Assembly. In this capacity, he proclaimed the independence of the Somali Republic on July 1, 1960, and the National Assembly chose him as provisional president of the republic for one year, and in 1961 elected him to a 6-year term. In the 1967 presidential elections, he was defeated by Abdirashid Ali Shermarke. According to the constitution, the former president enjoyed life membership of the National Assembly. In 1990, when the country was edging toward anarchy, he was among about 100 politicians who signed a manifesto expressing concern over the destruction, killings, and flight of refugees as a result of the civil war. He was arrested along with more than 50 others by Muhammad Siad Barre's faltering regime. After his release, he lived mostly on his farm in Janale in southern Somalia.\n\nDabain, Bator (D.)

March 24, 1930, Bouchia, Lobaye province, Middle Congo, French Equatorial Africa [now in Central African Republic] - d. Nov. 20, 2003, Yaoundé, Cameroon), president of the Central African Republic (1960-66, 1979-81). In March 1957 he was elected to the territorial assembly. Barthélemy Boganda appointed him minister of agriculture in the first government council of Oubangui-Chari, and in August 1958 minister of administrative affairs. In December 1958 he was named minister of the interior, economy, and trade of the Central African Republic, which Oubangui-Chari had become. When Boganda disappeared in a plane crash on March 29, 1959, Dacko, who claimed a family relationship, established himself as his successor. Outmanoeuvring the then vice-president of the government council, Abel Goumba, he had himself elected head of the government. He also took over leadership of the Mouvement d'Évolution Sociale de l'Afrique Noire (MESAN). Less than 30 years old, he now exercised sole power. With independence on Aug. 13, 1960, he became president, also taking the defense portfolio. He moved against Goumba's opposition party, the Mouvement pour l'Évolution Démocratique de l'Afrique Centrale (MEDAC). In November 1962 he officially abolished the multiparty system, dissolving MEDAC and institutionalizing MESAN as the nation's only party. On the night of Dec. 31, 1965/Jan. 1, 1966, Dacko was deposed by Jean-Bédel Bokassa (then a colonel and chief of staff), put under detention in Bangui, and then allowed to return to his village. In 1976, Bokassa appointed Dacko his personal councillor, a post that Dacko made a springboard for his coup on Sept. 21, 1979. Aided by French paratroops, Dacko proclaimed the fall of Bokassa while the latter was on a visit to Libya. Dacko in turn was removed from office in September 1981, when Gen. André Kolingba seized power. He unsuccessfully ran for president in 1993 and 1999.\n\nDacon, Dame Monica (Jessie), née Sheen (b.

Daddah\n\nDaddah, Moktar (Mohamedoun) Ould, Arabic Mukhtar bin Muhammad walad Daddah (b. Dec. 25, 1924, Boutilimit, Mauritania, French West Africa - d. Oct. 15, 2003, Paris, France), president of Mauritania (1961-78). He returned from his studies in Paris as the first Mauritanian with a university degree. He joined the more moderate of two rival parties, the Progressive Mauritanian Union, and in 1957 was elected to the territorial assembly. He became vice president, and in 1958 president, of the Government Council, and in 1959 prime minister. In 1958 he established a new unity party, the Mauritanian Regrouping Party, which in 1960 incorporated the chief remaining opposition party. Mauritania attained independence in 1960 and he was elected the country's first president in 1961. He was also foreign minister in 1960-62 and 1965. His first aim was national unity, a delicate problem in a country divided between a minority agricultural south and a largely nomadic Moorish centre and north. At first he tried to balance regional notables and impatient young modernizers in a basically parliamentary regime, but in 1964 he shifted to an authoritarian one-party system (Mauritanian People's Party, of which he was secretary-general). He was reelected as president in 1966, 1971, and 1976. In 1971-72 he was chairman of the Organization of African Unity. In July 1978 dissatisfaction with the costly attempt by Mauritania to annex part of former Spanish Sahara resulted in his ouster by a military coup d'état led by Lt.Col. Mustafa Ould Salek. He was released from prison in August 1979 and went into exile in France, where in May 1980 opposition movements formed the Alliance for a Democratic Mauritania. He returned to Mauritania on July 17, 2001.\n\nDade\n\nDadnadji\n\nDade, Arta (Agim) (b. March 15, 1953, Tiranë, Albania), foreign minister of Albania (2001-02).

Dec. 11, 1954, Dhikurpokhari, Kaski district, Nepal), prime minister of Nepal (2008-09, 2016-17, 2022-24). Dire socioeconomic conditions in western Nepal inspired him to join politics, in order to help uplift the poor. He began working with the Communist Party led by Pushpa Lal in 1972. In 1980 he was tasked with leading the All Nepal National Free Students' Union (Revolutionary), which was affiliated with the radical Communist Party of Nepal (Masal), or CPN (Masal), Masal meaning \"Flame\" in Nepalese. In 1983 he was elected to the central committee of the CPN (Masal); after two splits of the party, he joined the CPN (Mashal [\"Flame\" in Sanskrit]) in 1985, becoming a member of the politburo and in 1989 general secretary. Several of the groups merged in 1990 to form the CPN (Unity Centre), with him as general secretary, but in 1994 it split again. In March 1995 he renamed his branch to reflect its Maoist leanings - the CPN (Maoist). It launched a \"people's war\" to abolish the monarchy with an attack on several police stations in February 1996. During 10 years of insurgency, he remained underground, spending 8 of those years in India. He emerged in June 2006 in a public meeting with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and opposition leaders to negotiate the creation of a new government, and his popularity began to increase. The CPN (Maoist) won 220 seats in the April 2008 elections, becoming the largest party in the 601-member Constituent Assembly. In May the assembly voted to end the monarchy, and in August it elected Prachanda as the first prime minister of the republic. Without previous experience with parliamentary politics, he was faced with the task of rebuilding his country. In February 2009 a merger with a smaller party created the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). He resigned as prime minister in May 2009 when his attempt to fire the army chief, who had refused to free some 19,000 Maoist rebels and enlist them in the military (a central element of the 2006 peace agreement), was thwarted by Pres. Ram Baran Yadav. Due to further splitting, his party could not do well in the 2013 elections and was relegated to third position. Another merger in 2016 created the CPN (Maoist Centre). He served as prime minister again in 2016-17 after obtaining the backing of the Madhesi Front and entering a power-sharing deal with the Nepali Congress. In 2018 the CPN (Maoist Centre) merged with the CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist) into the Nepal Communist Party, with him and K.P. Sharma Oli as joint chairmen. However, the Supreme Court invalidated the merger in 2021. After elections in 2022, the two parties and four smaller ones formed a coalition government, with Dahal as prime minister to be followed by Oli after 2½ years; the coalition broke up earlier, though.\n\nDahanayake\n\nDahanayake, Wijayananda (b. Oct. 22, 1902 - d. May 4, 1997, Galle district, southern Sri Lanka), prime minister, foreign minister, and defense minister of Ceylon (1959-60). He became prime minister after the assassination of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) government in September 1959. His six-month tenure ended when the next general election, in March 1960, was won by the United National Party. Dahanayake was a member of the left-wing Lanka Sama Samaja Party before joining the SLFP administration. He also served as minister of education (1956-60), home affairs (1965-70), and cooperatives (1986-88).\n\nDahdah, Lucien (Mounir) (b. Aug. 15, 1929 - d.

He held several posts in the southwestern region after the Republic of China was founded in 1912. In 1916, following Sun Yat-sen, he led his Guizhou troops to Sichuan province to fight against the government of Duan Qirui in his southwestern region and soon took the gubernatorial posts of that province. His success in Sichuan threatened the reign of another Sichuan warlord, Gen. Liu Cunhou. He was killed or committed suicide upon the ambush launched by Liu's army in 1917.\n\nDaianu, Daniel (b.

June 18, 1884, Carpentras, Vaucluse, France - d. Oct. 10, 1970, Paris, France), prime minister of France (1933, 1934, 1938-40). Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1919 as a member of the Radical Party from Vaucluse département, he quickly made his mark in Paris. He joined the Édouard Herriot government as the minister of colonies (1924-25) and thereafter was minister of war (1925, 1932-34, 1936-40), public instruction and fine arts (1925-26, 1926), public works (1930, 1930-31, 1932), and foreign affairs (1934, 1939-40, 1940), deputy prime minister (1936, 1937-38), and president of the Radical Party (1927-31, 1936-39, 1957-58). On Jan. 31, 1933, he formed his own government, but it survived only until October. In January 1934 he formed a second ministry that survived only 10 days. He continued to move in and out of ministerial assignments as he led his Radical Party into the Popular Front coalition with Léon Blum's Socialists and the Communist Party (1935). In 1938 he again became premier. Amid a deteriorating international situation, Daladier, in his effort to avoid war, joined the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, in signing the Munich Pact with Adolf Hitler's Germany (Sept. 30, 1938). When France fell to Germany (June 1940), Daladier was one of those who sought to escape to French North Africa to set up a government-in-exile, but in Morocco he was arrested on Vichy orders and brought back to France. At his trial in Riom in February 1942, he and the other defendants accused the Philippe Pétain group of partial responsibility for the failure to prepare for war. He thereafter was handed over to the Germans, whose prisoner he remained until 1945. After the war he returned to the Chamber of Deputies (1946-58), was mayor of Avignon (1953-58), and as leader of the moribund Radical Party opposed Charles de Gaulle's new constitution of 1958. He then left politics.\n\nDalai Lama\n\nDalai Lama, 14th, personal name rJe-btsun-'Jam-dpal-ngag-dbang-blo-bzang-ye-shes-bstan-'dzin-rgya-mtsho, also spelled Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso (Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Compassionate, Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom), original name Lhamo Dhondrub (b. July 6, 1935, Taktser village, Kokonor region, northeastern Tibet), Dalai Lama from 1939. He was recognized at the age of two, in accordance with Tibetan tradition, as the reincarnation of his predecessor the 13th Dalai Lama. He was enthroned on Feb. 22, 1940. On Nov. 17, 1950, he was called upon to assume full political power after some 80,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers invaded Tibet. In 1954, he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders, including Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping. His efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the Sino-Tibetan conflict were unsuccessful. A popular uprising broke out, and on March 10, 1959, Lhasa exploded with the largest demonstration in Tibetan history, calling on China to leave Tibet and reaffirming Tibet's independence. The uprising was crushed by the Chinese army, and the Dalai Lama and 100,000 other refugees fled to India, where they were given political asylum. Since 1960, he has resided in Dharamsala, India, known as \"Little Lhasa,\" the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile. In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution, based on Buddhist principles and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a model for a future free Tibet. He publicly declared that once Tibet regains independence he will not hold political office. A series of journeys since 1967 took him to more than 40 nations. In 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his nonviolent campaign to end Chinese domination of Tibet. In 2011 he relinquished his political leadership role, in a move to strengthen the democratic structure of the exile government.\n\nd'Albedyhll, Christer Henrik friherre, original surname Albedyl (b. April 19, 1679, Riga, Sweden [now in Latvia] - d. Nov. 11, 1750, Odensfors, Östergötland, Sweden), governor of Östergötland (1736-47). He was made friherre (baron) in 1720.\n\nDalberg\n\nDalberg, Carl Theodor (Anton Maria Cämmerer von Worms,) Reichsfreiherr von (b. Feb. 8, 1744, Herrnsheim [now part of Worms, Rheinland-Pfalz] - d. Feb. 10, 1817, Regensburg, Bavaria), prince-primate of the Confederation of the Rhine (1806-13). A member of an important German noble family, he entered the church, becoming administrator of the bishopric of Erfurt in 1772. An advocate of German unity, he supported the League of Princes (Fürstenbund) formed under Friedrich II of Prussia in 1785 and, through Prussian influence, became coadjutor of Mainz and Worms in 1787 and of Konstanz in 1788. In 1802 he became archbishop elector of Mainz and so archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire; in 1803 he received the principality of Aschaffenburg and Regensburg. Dalberg, in fact, thanks to Prussian influence, was the only ecclesiastical prince to survive the reorganization of the empire effected in 1803, from which he emerged as chancellor of the empire and primate of Germany, with ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Mainz, Cologne, and Trier. He hoped to establish a national German church, but in 1805 the pope restricted him to the secular administration of his dioceses. Through Napoléon's influence, however, Frankfurt and the countships of Löwenstein-Wertheim and Rieneck were added to Dalberg's territories. He had already turned to Napoléon as the only hope for a unified Germany, and in 1806 he was appointed prince-primate of the Confederation of the Rhine. In 1810 Regensburg was ceded to Bavaria, but in compensation Dalberg received the principalities of Fulda and Hanau and the title of grand duke of Frankfurt. After the fall of Napoléon in 1814, the grand duchy was dismembered at the Congress of Vienna; Dalberg retained only the archbishopric of Regensburg.\n\nDalcin, Walmor Leal (b. Oct. 4, 1925, Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil - d. Dec. 12?, 1999), governor of Roraima (1969-70).\n\nDale, Charles M(ilby) (b. March 8, 1893, Browns Valley, Minn. - d. Sept. 25, 1978, Portsmouth, N.H.), governor of New Hampshire (1945-49).\n\nD. Dale\n\nDale, David (Kenneth Hay) (b. Jan. 27, 1927 - d. Nov. 8, 2001, Somerset, England), administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory (1975-76) and governor of Montserrat (1980-84).\n\nD'Alema\n\nD'Alema, Massimo (b. April 20, 1949, Rome), prime minister (1998-2000) and deputy prime minister and foreign minister (2006-08) of Italy. At the age of 13 he joined the Communist youth organization and he became a member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) at 19. In July 1987 he became a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the district of Lecce-Brindisi-Taranto (Apulia). In 1990 he joined the top party leadership and assisted the general secretary, Achille Occhetto, who embarked on a gradual liberalization of the party towards social democracy. In February 1991 the party was renamed Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). The left wing of the party then broke away and formed the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC) led by Armando Cossutta. The PDS joined the Socialist International in mid-1992. D'Alema advanced to the leadership of the PDS faction in the Chamber of Deputies in 1992. Before the general elections of March 1994 the PDS formed the \"Progressives\" alliance with the Socialists, the Greens, La Rete, the Democratic Alliance, and also with the PRC. This alliance of the left could not meet the high expectations, and Occhetto resigned as PDS secretary in June. His deputy, D'Alema, succeeded him. He was instrumental in creating the centre-left Ulivo (Olive Tree) alliance in February 1995 which was led by Romano Prodi. This alliance won the April 1996 elections, but D'Alema himself did not join the Prodi cabinet. In 1998 the PDS joined with various small left-wing parties to form the Left Democrats (DS). The PDS logo had a drastically scaled down hammer and sickle at the base of an oak tree, but now the old Communist emblem was ditched entirely and the DS used the red rose of European Socialism. Prodi's government fell later in 1998, and D'Alema formed a new coalition made up largely of the old Olive Tree.\n\nDales, Ien, byname of Catharina Isabella Dales (b. Oct. 18, 1931, Arnhem, Netherlands - d. Jan. 10, 1994, Utrecht, Netherlands), interior minister of the Netherlands (1989-94). She was also mayor of Nijmegen (1987-89).\n\nD'Alesandro, Thomas (Ludwig John), Jr. (b. Aug. 1, 1903, Baltimore, Md. - d.

Oct. 20, 2019, Baltimore), mayor of Baltimore (1967-71); son of Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.\n\nDaléus\n\nDaléus, Lennart (b. June 25, 1946, Stockholm), Swedish politician. He has been a leading figure in Sweden's environmental movement for over 25 years. He was a founder member of Swedish Friends of the Earth and a key campaigner to dismantle Sweden's nuclear industry. An active member of the Centre Party since 1980 and a member of parliament since 1991, he chaired the standing committee on agriculture and was chairman of the government's eco-cycle delegation responsible for developing an eco-cycle concept for Sweden. Daléus was elected party chairman in June 1998, replacing Olof Johansson. He resigned in January 2001.\n\nR.J. Daley\n\nDaley, Richard J(oseph) (b. May 15, 1902, Bridgeport area, Chicago, Ill. - d. Dec. 20, 1976, Chicago), mayor of Chicago (1955-76). By the time he was 21, he was a precinct captain in the local Democratic Party. He served as a state representative (1936-38) and senator (1938-46), state director of revenue (1948-50), and clerk of Cook County (1950-55) before being elected mayor, which at that time was only a confirmation of his status as the city's leading Democrat (in 1953 he had become chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party). He was reelected five times with generally substantial majorities. During his mayoralty he gained the confidence of the business community through large-scale urban renewal and highway construction projects and through a sweeping reform of the police department. Daley's administration was criticized, however, for its reluctance to check racial segregation in housing and in the public schools; for its encouragement of the construction of tall office buildings in the downtown area; and for its measures taken against demonstrators during the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Daley was called \"the last of the big-city bosses\" because of his tight control of Chicago politics through widespread job patronage. He attained great power in national Democratic Party politics, being a deciding factor at national conventions, and many believe that the Cook County machine's ability to produce badly needed votes from the graveyards was what won Illinois for John F. Kennedy in 1960, who narrowly carried the state and thus defeated Richard Nixon in the nation. Daley's last years were marred by scandals centred on members of his administration, though none of these touched the mayor himself. He died in office.\n\nR.M. Daley\n\nDaley, Richard M(ichael) (b. April 24, 1942, Bridgeport area, Chicago, Ill.), mayor of Chicago (1989-2011). He was the first of four sons of Richard J. Daley, who groomed him for public office, and the Daley political machine gave him a job in the city attorney's office after he passed the bar exam on the third attempt. Later, Daley won election to the Illinois Senate, filling a vacancy his father had arranged. In 1980 Daley was elected to the first of three terms as Cook County state's attorney, despite the opposition of several prominent Democrats, including Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne. Three years later he ran against Byrne for mayor, a move that split the white vote and ensured the historic election of Harold Washington, who enjoyed monolithic support from the black community. Washington's death from a heart attack in late 1987 cleared the path for another Daley run for mayor. He beat black Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the Democratic primary in February 1989 and black independent Alderman Timothy Evans, by a margin of almost 15 points, in the general election in April. In a race shaped by race, Daley won by garnering the votes of more than 90% of the whites who cast ballots, including many of the affluent, independent-minded lakefront residents who had voted for Washington in 1983 and 1987. Daley's election represented the first time since 1971 that a white had replaced a black as mayor of a major U.S. city. That fact alarmed some Chicago blacks, who feared that Daley would revive the \"plantation politics\" they felt had characterized his father's 21-year reign (1955-76). But the new mayor vowed to reach out to minorities, a promise he began to fulfill in May 1989 when he appointed blacks and Hispanics to head several of the city's largest departments. He was reelected in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007.\n\nDaley, William M(ichael) (b. Aug. 8, 1948, Chicago, Ill.), U.S. secretary of commerce (1997-2000) and White House chief of staff (2011-12); son of Richard J. Daley; brother of Richard M. Daley.

Damaskinos was exiled to the mountain monastery of Phaneromeni on Salamis but then recalled in July 1941, after Greece had been occupied by the Germans during World War II, to replace Chrysanthos. As archbishop, he opposed the German occupation and urged the concealment of Jews to save them from the Nazis.

March 12, 1863, Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy - d. March 1, 1938, Gardone Riviera, on Lake Garda), Italian political leader. He was a famous writer, but when his works failed to finance his extravagant lifestyle, he fled from his creditors to France in 1910. When World War I broke out, he returned to Italy to passionately urge his country's entry into the war. After Italy declared war he plunged into the fighting himself, seeking out dangerous assignments in several branches of the service, finally in the air force, where he lost an eye in combat. He was bitterly disappointed in seeing Italy, as he thought, robbed of her due at the peace conference, and he told the Allied statesmen his opinion of them in no measured terms. In September 1919 D'Annunzio and about 300 supporters, in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles, occupied the Dalmatian port of Fiume (Rijeka in present-day Croatia), which the Italian government and the Allies were proposing to incorporate into the new Yugoslav state but which D'Annunzio believed rightly belonged to Italy. He was given an extraordinary welcome, and ruled Fiume as dictator until December 1920, at which time Italian military forces compelled him to abdicate his rule. Nevertheless, by his bold action he had established Italy's interest in Fiume, and the port became Italian in 1924. D'Annunzio subsequently became an ardent Fascist and was rewarded by Benito Mussolini with a title and a national edition of his works, but he exercised no further influence on Italian politics.\n\nDanon, Danny (b.

Oct. 26, 1759, Arcis-sur-Aube [now in Aube département], France - d. April 5, 1794, Paris, France), French revolutionary leader. Following the outbreak of the 1789 French Revolution, he founded the Cordeliers' Club with Jean-Paul Marat and Camille Desmoulins in 1790. In 1791 he became increasingly prominent in the revolutionary movement and for some time fled to England. In 1792 he became minister of justice following the fall of the monarchy, for which he was largely credited. When the country was threatened by invading Prussians and Austrians, Danton stepped into the vacuum; refusing to move the government out of Paris, he insisted that the successful defense of France depended on the capital's revolutionary energy. Elected to the National Convention in September 1792, he voted for the death of the ex-king in January 1793. His dealings with Gen. Charles Dumouriez have never been clarified. When Dumouriez went over to the Austrians in March 1793, the Girondins, the moderate party, accused Danton of complicity with the general. Boldly turning the tables, Danton made the same accusation against the Girondins. In April-July he was one of the nine original members of the Committee of Public Safety. He attempted to mediate between rival parties in the Convention, but failed, and the Girondins were expelled in June. In July-August he was president of the Convention. He reappeared from time to time as the tribune of the people, eloquently voicing the demands of the masses, yet at the same time he tried to set bounds to the movement and keep it under control. He came to be looked upon as the leader of the moderate opposition. Losing power to Maximilien Robespierre in the Reign of Terror, Danton retired from active politics, but in March 1794 he and his followers were arrested for conspiracy against the republic. His audacious defense led the Revolutionary Tribunal to concoct a decree to deprive accused persons who had \"insulted justice\" from further pleading, and he was pronounced guilty and guillotined. He was rehabilitated under the Second Empire and enshrined as a hero under the Third Republic.\n\nDanuatmodjo, Winarno (d.

May 15, 2003, Bucharest, Romania), prime minister of Romania (1982-89). He was ousted from office during a popular revolt in 1989 along with Pres. Nicolae Ceausescu. In the dying moments of the regime, he was sent by Ceausescu to Timisoara, the city in western Romania where the revolt began, to try to crush it. Dascalescu at first refused to talk to the demonstrators, declaring, \"I won't speak to hooligans,\" but later changed his mind and met with representatives of the crowd. About 150 people who had been detained by the secret police were released on his orders during the negotiations, but Dascalescu failed in his attempts to stop the revolt. He was arrested after the revolt and tried on genocide charges, along with other Ceausescu aides, for allegedly contributing to hundreds of deaths during the anti-Communist revolt. The charges were later lowered to first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1991, but was later released on medical grounds.\n\nDaschle\n\nDaschle, Tom, byname of Thomas Andrew Daschle (b. Dec. 9, 1947, Aberdeen, S.D.), U.S. politician. He was a congressional aide to U.S. Sen. James Abourezk (1972-77) and in 1978 he won the first of four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1986 he defeated the incumbent to win election to the Senate, and he was reelected overwhelmingly in 1992 and 1998. He became a member of the powerful Finance Committee while still a freshman senator and in 1988 was appointed cochair of the Democratic Policy Committee. Other legislative interests of Daschle included agriculture and veterans' and Indian affairs. He gained a reputation for looking out for the interests of his constituents, and every year he drove himself throughout South Dakota to visit each of its 66 counties and to talk to voters. In 1994 he won the position of Democratic leader by one vote, and he became minority leader in the Senate at the beginning of the 1995 session. A soft-spoken man, he had a reputation for being fair and inclusive, but he was a skillful tactician and could be tough when needed. On June 6, 2001, the Senate passed to Democratic control when Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent, which gave the Democrats a 50-49 majority. As Daschle became majority leader, he declared that parts of Pres. George W. Bush's legislative program, including drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and quick deployment of a missile defense system, would not pass the Senate. A patients' bill of rights cleared the Senate despite the president's threat to veto it, and Daschle took the lead in blaming the Bush tax cut for the disappearance of the budget surplus. The Senate passed to Republican control after the 2002 elections, and he became minority leader again. In 2004 he was defeated for reelection by Republican John Thune. In 2008 he was nominated for secretary of health and human services, but ultimately withdrew, faced with problems over back taxes and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nD'Ascoli (Sotillo), Carlos Alberto (b.

From 1903 he took part in many congresses of the Socialist International, always insisting on the independence and reunification of all Polish lands as an integral part of the Polish socialist program. From 1912 he collaborated to this end with Józef Pilsudski, whom he then admired. Also in 1912 he became editor in chief of the Polish socialist daily newspaper Naprzód (\"Forward\") in Kraków. During World War I he was one of the founders of the Polish National Committee, and for some days he was the head of the first provisional government of restored Poland, formed at Lublin on Nov. 7, 1918.

Feb. 20, 1992, San Salvador, El Salvador), Salvadoran political leader. He served as an intelligence officer with the National Guard and then as deputy director of Ansesal, the presidential security agency. When reformists in the military overthrew Pres. Carlos Humberto Romero in October 1979, he was given backing by the coffee oligarchs, who resisted demands for land redistribution and political reforms, to organize new political parties. D'Aubuisson, who was described by a former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador as a \"pathological killer,\" was implicated in the May 1980 abortive coup to unseat Col. Adolfo Arnoldo Majano Ramos. He wished to reverse all reforms carried out by José Napoleón Duarte's regime and denounced peace talks with leftist rebels. In March 1981, following allegations that he had been involved in the murder of Archbishop Óscar Romero a year earlier, he took refuge in Guatemala, returning in late 1981 to form the extreme right-wing Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA). He failed to fulfill his hopes of becoming president after the March 1982 elections but did secure the powerful position of president of the Constituent Assembly (1982-83). In 1984 he lost the presidential election to Duarte. D'Aubuisson was widely characterized as the brains behind the Union of White Warriors, which allegedly conducted assassinations by \"death squad\" during the 1979-92 civil war, which claimed some 75,000 lives. In 1989 ARENA's candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, became president. D'Aubuisson tried to uphold the party hard line amid Cristiani's attempts to negotiate an end to the civil war. Just five weeks before D'Aubuisson's death, a formal ceasefire was signed.\n\nDaud\n\nDaud Khan, Sardar Mohammad (b. July 18, 1909, Kabul, Afghanistan - d.

King Nadir Shah made him a major general in 1932; he subsequently served as military commander of several provinces and in 1939-47 of the central forces at Kabul. In 1946 Prime Minister Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan (his uncle) named him minister of defense. After a disagreement with Shah Mahmud, he was sent to Paris as ambassador in 1948. He returned a year later to serve as minister of the interior and head of tribal affairs. In the latter position he exacerbated the dispute between Afghanistan and the new state of Pakistan, vigorously promoting demands for self-determination in the Pashtun tribal territories of Pakistan. In 1953 he seized power from his uncle in a bloodless coup. During his tenure as prime minister (known as \"Daud's decade\") he modernized the Afghan state. He maintained a policy of nonalignment, playing off the United States and the Soviet Union against each other. Daud remained a Pashtun nationalist. In 1963 confrontation with Pakistan, which controlled the principal land route from Afghanistan to the sea, led to an economic crisis that forced him to resign. He was the main target of a 1964 constitutional provision in which members of the royal family were forbidden to stand for election or to serve as ministers. With the help of Soviet-trained army officers, he seized power on July 17, 1973. He proclaimed a republic and himself president. When he turned away from the U.S.S.R. in 1977, the latter increased its support for the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA).
