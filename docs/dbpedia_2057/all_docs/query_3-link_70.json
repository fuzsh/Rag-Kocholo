        "text": "Among the countries where colonial slavery existed, present-day Brazil has undoubtedly produced the richest and most abundant research into this terrible part of its history.[2] But due to linguistic barriers, this decisive contribution to the understanding, and therefore the memory, of the institution of slavery is little known outside Brazil's borders. Nonetheless, Brazilian research on the history of slavery has been in continual dialogue with North American scholarship, which has in turn produced a number of the finest specialists in the field,[3] some of whom have ended up at Brazilian universities.[4] Brazil’s system of forced labor was the largest and most continuous of all the slave societies in the Atlantic world, and it molded Brazilian ways of life and culture in complex ways.\n\nBrazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery, on May 13, 1888, and Portugal was one of the first European empires to make slavery the primary tool of its colonization of the Atlantic world. The colonists who landed in Brazil in 1530 to establish sugar cane plantations and mills to process the cane—an enterprise that had been proved successful on the island of Madeira—quickly turned to servile labor to clear and cultivate the land. The first contingents of slaves were drawn from the native populations, but this course rapidly revealed itself to be impractical. The epidemic diseases brought from Europe decimated the indigenous populations even more quickly when Indians were concentrated together to labor. And the Jesuit missionaries who arrived alongside the first colonists had other projects in mind for the indigenous peoples: They believed that conversion depended on a rejection of native culture, and that the latter would result once the Indians had become wage-earning rural workers rather than slaves. The Tupi themselves did not take to agricultural work, which they considered subsistence labor proper only for women.[5] Being good warriors, they did not hesitate to revolt or attack the European plantations. So when the Portuguese crown, trying to satisfy the Company of Jesus, placed strict regulations on the enslavement of Indians in Brazil, colonists looked to the transfer of African captives from the other side of the Atlantic, a turn of events that the Jesuits were not the last to benefit from.[6] The comfortable profits being produced by the plantations further stimulated the transition. By 1570, the first slave ships had arrived in Brazil, and they did not stop arriving until 1850, when the trans-Atlantic transfer of captives to Brazil was finally effectively outlawed. Between these two dates, four to five million Africans were shipped overseas to work and live as slaves in the plantations, mines, and cities of Brazil.[7]\n\nOne of the finest non-Brazilian specialists in Portuguese colonial slavery wrote in 1988 that it was impossible to pen a page of Brazilian history without the question of slavery forcing its way into the discussion.[8] And yet, a proper history of the institution of slavery and its effects on life in the country or on the lives of the free or captive men and women who inhabited it was relatively late in the making. Nonetheless, in the 1970s, while Brazil was still under the military dictatorship installed in 1964, the history of slavery became a central focus of intellectual debate, including heated disputes over politics and memory. Once this had begun, nothing could stop the rush of research or the sheer intensity of argument that still characterizes this extremely rich area of Brazilian academia.\n\nIt would be presumptuous to imagine that one could write an exhaustive summary of Brazilian academic work on slavery. The last synthesis, published in English by two eminent specialists in slavery’s demographic history, and which cites more than five hundred titles (books and articles) in its bibliography, did not presume to be comprehensive, settling instead on providing the reader with a dispassionate and cumulative survey of the historiography.[9] I will show the same prudence, at least concerning the most recent and most prolific period, which began when students who had received their training in the five or six doctoral schools that carried on this scholarship to the end of the 1990s (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Belo Horizonte and Campinas) began to spread out across the country. I will limit myself to describing how the historical debates around slavery took shape in Brazil, and the process by which researchers, engaged also in international discussions on these questions (particularly parallel work going on in the United States), built up this immensely rich and constantly expanding field.[10]\n\nBefore and After the Atlantic Trade: Indians and Blacks in Brazilian Historiography\n\nBrazilian intellectuals and researchers did not truly address the question of slavery until fairly recently. When the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute (IHGB) was created in 1838 to undertake the mission of writing the history of the country, it was more concerned with what place the Indians would occupy rather than the roles played by African slaves.[11] In the nineteenth century, the question of slavery—though it lay at heart of every debate—was only a true field of study for the jurists who were confronted with the difficulties of writing a civil code specific to Brazil. The three volumes by legal scholar and abolitionist Agostinho Marques Perdigão Malheiro, Escravidão no Brasil: ensaio histórico, jurídico e social, published in 1866, were for a long time among the few works available on the topic.[12]\n\nIn the period following abolition, the focus of interest turned to the \"black man\" rather than the ex-slave. Intellectuals in post-slavery Brazil wondered what to do with the African portion of their society, and how to protect this population from its alleged \"defects.\" Raimundo Nina Rodrigues put the question before the medical faculty of Salvador, doing so from a perspective that was not entirely free of the pseudo-scientific stereotypes current at that time.[13] But the tone changed very quickly, and by the 1920s, many voices were raised across Brazil ridiculing the pseudo-science of racial (or geographic) determinism.\n\nIn Salvador, Arthur Ramos[14] succeeded his mentor, Nina Rodrigues, and from a perspective more in line with the developing field of anthropology, reinterpreted concept of \"primitivism\" within a culturalist framework: The residual stigmas of slavery were not inscribed in the African \"race,\" but in the ways of life of those who had been enslaved and their descendants. A near contemporary in Recife, Gilberto Freyre, coming from a long line of Pernambuco sugar mill owners, followed in Ramos's footsteps. But unlike Ramos, Freyre left Brazil to do his studies going to the United States, going first to Texas, then to Columbia University in New York, where he joined Franz Boas's circle. There, he acquired solid sociological and anthropological training. In the U.S. he discovered a post-slavery society under the most rigorous apartheid, against which the American anthropologist and his students sharpened their arguments. Freyre did not come empty-handed; he brought to the debate his first-hand knowledge of Northeastern Brazilian society, upon which Boas's students drew eagerly.[15] Returning to Brazil after two trips to Europe (one of which, during the coup d’état of 1930, had been a forced exile), he published in 1933 the book that would create a decisive break in the way the racial question was viewed in Brazil: Casa-grande e senzala.[16] He picked up on Ramos's thesis, that alleged \"defects\" of black Brazilians were the result of the painful experience of living in a slave society, but added to this an anthropological explanation that took into account the vices as well as the virtues of that society. According to Freyre, Brazilian men and women, black or white, were products of a social order, the patriarchal order, that was born on the colonial sugar plantation, more specifically, in its \"big house\" (casa grande) where the master and slaves lived together. Out of these encounters came the mestiçagem (\"mixture\") that was so characteristic of Brazilian society, and which Freyre interpreted as an opportunity rather than a degradation of the \"races\" involved. He also saw it as a mode of interracial relations that was less harsh than those of other colonial empires. The Portuguese colonist, Freyre maintained, did not refuse to see in the slave the human being who was placed in servitude, and he was able to distinguish between the slave's status as a commodity and the race that society had assigned to him. Even if it was true that the violence characteristic of slave societies existed in Brazil, it did not necessarily result in the relegation of ex-slaves or their descendants to a devalued and immutable social category, nor did it prevent the step-by-step creation of a \"racial democracy\" through widespread manumissions, the gradual emancipations of the nineteenth century, and finally full abolition on May 13, 1888.\n\nBy reformulating the problematic of post-slavery Brazilian society in this way, Freyre also created a space for comparative study for researchers from the United States, who, in the wake of Boas, were examining the intractability of the question of race in their own country. In the years before and after the Second World War, some among them would make this subject their own. Such was the case for Franklin Frazier and Melville Herskovits, who chose Brazil as a testing ground for their contradictory interpretations of post-slavery black cultures. Frazier saw only anomy in the Afro-Brazilian family structures in Salvador, while Herskovits thought he recognized the vestiges of African cultures. Both of them, however, understood the mixed-race society of Bahia through Freyre's lens.[17] This was even truer for Frank Tannenbaum when he created a model of the dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant post-slavery societies, in which the former were characterized by \"race mixture\" while the latter were marked by racial segregation.[18]\n\nFreyre's main thesis was so influential that, following the end of the Second World War, UNESCO would try to prove it scientifically, within the framework of its anti-racism programs, in a large study headed by the Swiss anthropologist Alfred Métraux. Indeed, UNESCO’s department of Social Sciences in Paris had been directed by the Brazilian scholar Arthur Ramos, who throughout the war had fought tirelessly against Nazi ideas. Donald Pierson's study, Negroes in Brazil,[19] which had been heavily influenced by Freyre's ideas, was chosen as the basis for the research project that took place from 1950 to 1951 in several regions, and which found that in Brazil, racism increased in proportion to an area’s urban and working-class character. In a brief conclusion aimed at readers of The UNESCO Courier, Métraux did not distance himself radically from Freyre's ideas, even if he did temper their optimism by adding a question mark to the famous phrase of the now-elder scholar from Recife: \"Brazil: land of harmony for all races?\"[20]\n\nBut Brazilian historiography in the 1950s was not limited to the explorations of race that Freyre's work had opened. Historians from the United States undertook close study of agrarian economies in Brazil, which had developed in quite different ways from those of the North American colonial plantations. The relatively late coffee boom drew a good deal of attention. The work of Stanley J. Stein on the Paraíba Valley would become a model for several generations of researchers who would, like him, try to understand the forms of transition between slavery and free labor. Warren Dean's 1976 monograph on Rio Claro in the São Paulo province, for example, would follow in the same vein.[21]\n\nThe São Paulo School: The Sociology of Slavery as a Mode of Production\n\nIn Brazil debates about race provided the initial push toward research into slavery. Among the sociologists Métraux had recruited to work in São Paulo was a young professor from the University of São Paulo (USP), Florestan Fernandes. He had been a student of the French academics who had helped found the College of Philosophy, Science and Literature in 1934, notably Roger Bastide. Mentor and student would reunite in 1955 to co-author the report of the UNESCO study’s findings.[22] In his introduction, Bastide demolished the premise that had launched the study. He contended that in the state of São Paulo, where an archaic world on its way out converged with a new world that had not known slavery, prejudice based on color was not erased, it simply changed its role. The racist ideology that had been used to justify the enslavement of Africans had become a means of essentializing class hierarchies. In the preface to the second edition, published in 1958, Fernandes renewed and refined this critique:\n\nIn this view, Freyre now became an example of one who was himself contaminated by the preconceito de cor (color prejudice).\n\nFlorestan Fernandes did not stop there. He put his own students to work sharpening this critique through fieldwork and historical research. Among these students, Fernando Henrique Cardoso—a future President of the Brazilian Republic—was charged with studying the Rio Grande do Sul, and Otávio Ianni would study Paraná. Both of them looked to the past for explanations of the specificities of contemporary societies. When their dissertations were published in 1962, Brazil gained a historiographical base for thinking about slavery, even if it had come out of sociology.[24]\n\nCardoso and Ianni, using Marxism as their interpretive framework, characterized slavery (escravatura) as a mode of production and as a form of social organization.[25] Henceforth, the unique characteristics of Brazilian society would no longer be expressed in moral or psychological terms, but in economic ones. Slavery did not prevent the development of agrarian capitalism within the colonial mercantile system, but it would come into conflict with it. As a consequence, abolition was seen less as the result of human effort than as the collapse of the economic system. For Cardoso, the relationship of slave to master was one of domination \"in its pure form,\" which precluded any autonomy.[26] For Ianni, when the system \"was running smoothly,\" it self-regulated to thwart any rebellion, but when it malfunctioned, it offered the dominated an opportunity to occupy new spaces: a slave became a Black or a Mulatto, or he became a citizen.[27] As Stuart Schwartz would write several years later, this generation of scholars was less interested in slaves than in slavery itself, especially because, in the face of the economic modernity of nineteenth-century Europe, the institution seemed to have become archaic.[28]\n\nCardoso and Ianni framed arguments based in substantial documentary evidence. And while this evidence consisted mostly of printed materials (newspapers, official publications by the provincial government, traveler's accounts, politicians’ letters, etc.), it was gathered and used in a manner quite different from Freyre’s.[29] When Richard Graham, writing from the United States, assembled the first overview of the historiography in 1970, he noted this development: With the new generation, historical research had taken a decisive step forward, and slavery was their central preoccupation.[30] The \"São Paulo group\" that formed around these young researchers soon gained a new member, Emília Viotti da Costa, who would publish her thesis four years after her two colleagues.[31] She too had continually denounced Freyre's illusions, and like others in her cohort she was first and foremost interested in historical transitions. She chose the coffee-producing region of São Paulo for her research because it contained two zones whose histories and destinies would be antagonistic. On the one hand, there was the valley of Paríba, an early adopter of coffee-growing that had inherited the traditional plantation economy, with its large scale use of slaves from the Atlantic trade. On the other hand, the center and the east of São Paulo province would develop only in the second half of the century, following a modern and mechanized model in which workers from Europe and Creole slaves from the Northeast were combined. The resistance of longstanding slave-owning planters to the new demands of a capitalist economy and the coffee industrialists' choice of new and more efficient modes of production lay at the heart of her study. The central section of her thesis, moreover, provided a fresh description of slavery in the nineteenth century and represented its first overview in the Brazilian historiography. Contrasting urban slavery and plantation slavery, she described the relationships of domination and their violence, and made room for the diverse forms of contesting the established order: rebellions, escapes, quilombos (communities of maroon slaves), murders of overseers or masters, etc. Nonetheless, she did not see in these actions the early manifestation of a collective consciousness that could lead to an organized revolt such as the 1823 Demerara revolt in British Guyana.[32] Instead, these were individual reactions produced by the disintegration of a social and economic order, which was accelerated when free labor and slave labor confronted each other. From her point of view, abolitionist ideals developed and gave rise to a certain degree of sympathy among the free population (including some whites) for those who refused a condition that was increasingly perceived as inhumane and degrading. Viotti’s reading of the sources remains, even today, exemplary. Implicit in her work are most of the themes that would be explored and brought to light by the generation that followed.\n\nRichard Graham’s landmark review essay underlined Viotti's foresight and hoped for continued scholarship in the direction of her work. Like her, he continued to think that the myth of a gentle slavery had to be denounced, but he suggested doing so with more reliable tools, particularly by using rigorous demographic history, the sources for which, he believed, were near at hand. He added that historians would not be able to understand race relations in contemporary Brazil if they did not look into the lives of free and freed people during the era of slavery. With a great deal of lucidity, he outlined what would be the major research questions of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nA History of Slaves: The 1970s and 1980s\n\nOne of the paradoxes of this period is that while the university reforms of 1968 would push the best São Paulo professors into exile—Fernandes, Cardoso, Ianni, and Viotti were among the seventy professors banned in 1969—it would also plant the seeds for modernization of the curriculum. In particular, the modernization of post-graduate degrees (the master’s [mestrado], and the doctorate) would professionalize historical research in Brazil.[33] But only after things began to open up again, beginning in 1976, did the system become productive. In a relatively short period of time, numerous master’s and doctoral dissertations laid the foundation for a shift from largely anthropological and sociological work to a wide-ranging archival-based historical scholarship. Slavery was one of the main issues this new cohort pursued.\n\nThe year 1988 marked the hundredth anniversary of the abolition of slavery, as well as the first year of new federal democratic constitution, and it provided an excellent opportunity to take stock of the scholarly production on slavery. In 1962 Cardoso had found only twenty-four works on slavery in Brazil. Edison Carneiro, in 1964, listed seventy works in his extensive bibliography on \"the Black man\" in Brazil; most of these were folkloric or ethnographic studies. Viotti cited some sixty works in 1966. Stuart Schwartz, in his historiographical study published on the hundredth anniversary of 1888, found more than a hundred.[34]\n\nFor Schwartz, the extremely fruitful work done in the 1970s and 1980s was characterized by two large-scale transformations. The first was the introduction of quantitative methods, under the influence of English-language historical work and that of the Annales school. The second transformation involved the evolution from the study of escravismo (as a mode of production) to the history of escravidão (slavery), which is to say of slave society in its full three dimensions: forms of labor, social organizations, and cultural practices. One clear change was the systematic use of archival sources. Indeed, many such sources had survived, contrary to the long-standing myth that the Minister Rui Barbosa had destroyed them at the time of abolition.[35] A combination of fiscal-administrative exigencies and notarial practices brought from the Iberian Peninsula had resulted in an impressive level of documentation. Moreover, the lives of slaves were more likely to be recorded than those of free men and women. And while it is true that they were often spoken for or written for, sometimes their words or stances were directly recorded by the scribe's hand. It is not surprising, therefore, that these documents supported the rise of a rich and prolific historiography.\n\nThe question of slavery filtered into every area of historical research: legal history, religious history, historical demography, economic history, social and cultural history, etc. On all sides arguments broke out between researchers from different generations or from contrasting professional cultures. I will list here only a few of the most illustrative examples.\n\nNew Archives, New Territorial Divisions, New Questions: The Current State of the History of Slavery in Brazil\n\nThe analytical methods that have been adopted since the hundredth anniversary of the 1888 emancipation—whether they came out of social and cultural history, the history of mentalités or, later, microhistory—have taken Brazilian historiography on slavery in a powerful new direction, although not all the bridges to quantitative history or Marxism have been burned. The historical production of the last twenty-five years has been as rich as it is complex. The researchers who came of age during earlier debates are now at the helm, and are making good use of their positions of leadership. Today, there are three generations at work. The first pioneered the affirmation of slave agency in the face of the Marxist old guard in the 1970s; this group has received a good deal of support from those who have continued with quantitative history and brought it into the service of the same causes. Second, their students, who expanded exploration of the archives by picking up on problematics identified by their mentors but pushing them further; and finally, the mestrado and doctoral students of the second group. Each large university center has in this way spread its influence across the entire country, as new universities were established and new doctoral schools (programas de pós-graduação) created. If the end of the military period was marked by a professionalization of history, the two governments of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva have overseen the massive expansion of Brazilian universities and the opening of positions to most of the high-quality researchers trained by the 1980s generation. At this point, it becomes tricky to summarize their production due to the rapidly increasing volume of work being done. This has only become truer as mestrado and doctoral works are systematically being posted online, further diversifying scholarly production.[71]\n\nWe can see the same threads in overviews attempted at the end of the 1990s[72] and during the 2000s.[73] The great historiographical arguments of the 1980s and 1990s are still present; in fact, they have only grown more intense under the accumulation of empirical research. At the heart of this impressive volume of work, however, two important turns are clearly discernible. One began in the 1990s, when the most fruitful research was focused on judicial archives. Documents therein were considered to carry the voices of men and women who were trapped in the slave system but also cogs necessary to it. The other, beginning in the 2000s, was marked by the entry of Africa into the analytical scene. From that moment forward, the continent ceased to be simply the distant origin of a culture; it became a kind of fully engaged agent—economically, politically, socially—without which the story of slavery in the Americas would be incomplete.\n\nThe history of the academic journal Afro-Ásia, every issue of which is now available online, provides an excellent record of the development that has occurred since the 1990s.[74] Created in Salvador in 1965 by the Center for Afro-Oriental Studies at the University of Bahia, the journal took a complicated view of the legacy of colonialism. On the one hand, it tried to group together the oriental and occidental territories of the Portuguese Indies; on the other, it hoped to document the decolonization struggles in Africa. Perhaps above all, it wanted to be a forum for debates on the question of blackness in Brazil (essentially in the Bahia). From time to time it would touch upon the history of slavery, but initially it did not make this a central theme. Up until 1995, well after the end of the dictatorship, the journal’s issues appeared only irregularly, but everything changed in 1996 when two young professors from the UFBa, Antônio Sérgio A. Guimarães (a sociologist) and João José Reis (a historian), both trained in the United States, took over its editorial direction.[75] In a few years, it would become the major publication on the history of slavery and its legacy in Brazil. Its production therefore provides an excellent vantage point from which to look into the dynamics of the field, even if some of its choices do, of course, reflect the specific character of the Bahian school.\n\nNotes\n\nTranslated from the French by Thomas Scott Railton. I would especially like to thank Silvia Hunold Lara and Sidney Chalhoub, with whom I drafted the first outlines of this historiographical paper. It also owes a great deal to numerous discussions that I had with João José Reis, Robert W. Slenes, Hebe M. Mattos, Keila Grinberg, Marcus Carvalho, and Mariza de Carvalho Soares. All of my thanks to my translator, Thomas Scott-Railton, to my copyeditor Terre Fisher, to Keila Grinberg, Hebe Mattos, and Silvia Lara, for their attentive reading and feedback on earlier drafts, and to Rebecca J. Scott for her advice on the final text. Thanks also to my students in Paris and Ann Arbor who, through their reactions, showed me how to become more clear and precise. Finally, thanks to Martha S. Jones who helped me to better understand the links between Brazilian and U.S. historiography. An earlier version of this text appeared in French in Brésil: quatre siècles d'esclavage. Nouvelles questions, nouvelles recherches, ed. Jean Hébrard (Paris: Karthala and CIRESC, 2012), under the title “L'esclavage au Brésil: le débat historiographique et ses racines” (pp. 7–62).\n\nThis was the conclusion reached by two historians—one Brazilian, the other from the U.S.—in the preface to one of the most recent English-language overviews of the history of slavery in Brazil: Herbert S. Klein and Francisco Vidal Luna, Slavery in Brazil (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010). They write: “In fact, one could argue that the Brazilian historians and economists are doing more studies on their institution of slavery than is now occurring in the United States, despite the imbalance in the size of the historical profession in the two countries” (p. ix).\n\nAmong others, in alphabetical order, Bert Barickman, Laird Bergad, Kim D.

It would be far too large to be given here without drastic and necessarily subjective choices. One should look to Joseph C.

A Bibliography, vol. 1, 1900–1994, (New York: Krauss International Publishers, 1993); vol. 2, 1992–1996, (New York: M. E. Sharpe, 1999). For the years after this, one should consult the journal Slavery and Abolition's Annual Bibliographical Supplement, which appears each year in the final issue.\n\nThere is now an abundant Portuguese-language body of work on the Institute and its historical project in Brazil.

Sadly, this documentation remains un-consulted in the archives” (Capitalismo e escravidão, p. 64, n. 49). In fact, the only archival materials used by these two authors were historical sources published in the journals of the largest Brazilian archives.\n\n“Rigorous historical methodology stood in sharp contrast to the sloppy amateurishness of the bulk of those who up to then had cultivated the historian's garden.

The book provides a lucid summary of the evolution of historiography in her country and calls for combining the new approaches with the structural analysis of societies, which she considered irreplaceable. João J. Reis’s review of the Portuguese translation of the book in Afro-Ásia (20–21 (1998–99): 382-388) is very enlightening on the debate going on during this time between Brazilian historians of slavery and their distinguished predecessor (cf. also E.

Russell-Wood, “Brazilian Archives and Recent Historiography on Colonial Brazil,” Latin American Research Review, 36, 1 (2001): 75–105.\n\nIn the beginning, the debate ran between those who saw the Brazilian colony as an example of a feudal society (Oliveira Vianna, Gilberto Freyre) and those who, following Caio Prado Junior and his Formação do Brasil contemporâneo: Colônia (São Paulo: Editora Brasiliense, 1953) saw the signs of a fairly advanced capitalist mode of production. There is an English translation of this very important book, The Colonial Background of Modern Brazil (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967). Fernando A. Novais's dissertation, defended in 1973 at the USP, is the most developed example of this trend. It was published only six years later as Portugal e Brasil na crise do antigo sistema colonial (1777–1808) (São Paulo: Editora Hucitec, 1979). Novais examined in detail the colonial mercantilist model, which was in crisis in the Portuguese empire at the end of the eighteenth century, and placed slavery within the framework of primitive accumulation of capital (as labor force and as tradable good). But, like Caio Prado Jr., Novais did not attribute a special function to the colonial territory, which he interpreted primarily as an extension of the peninsular one. On the other side, Jacob Gorender’s O escravismo colonial (São Paulo: Editora Ática, 1980), among others, advanced a revision of the Marxist dogma supported by a reinterpretation in the vein of Reading ‘Capital’ by Althusser and Balibar. Gorender described a slave mode of production specific to the colonial context in which the accumulation necessary to reproduce the economic cycle necessarily passed through the accumulation of slaves and therefore froze—and even destroyed—a large portion of the available capital.\n\nCiro Flamarion S. Cardoso trained at the University of Paris X under the direction of Frédéric Mauro. He wrote his dissertation on the colonial history of French Guyana (“La Guyane française [1715–1817]. Aspects économiques et sociaux. Contribution à l´étude des sociétés esclavagistes d’Amérique”) and defended it in 1971.\n\nSee Ciro F. S. Cardoso, Agricultura, escravidão e capitalismo (Petrópolis: Vozes, 1979), chap. 4; “The Peasant Breach in the Slave System: New Developments in Brazil,” Luso-Brazilian Review, 25, 1 (1988): 49–57. On the brecha camponesa, see Tadeusz Lepkowski, Haiti (Havana: Casa de las Américas, 1968), 2 vols. (particularly vol. 1, pp. 59–60). On the proto-peasantry, see Sidney W. Mintz, Caribbean Transformations (Chicago: Aldine, 1974). Stuart B. Schwartz opened the empirical debate with “Resistance and Accommodation in Eighteenth-Century Brazil: The Slaves’ View of Slavery,” Hispanic American Historical Review, 57, 1 (1977): 69–81.\n\nMaria Luiza Marcílio, La Ville de São Paulo.

Klein: “Slave Economy and Society in Minas Gerais and São Paulo, Brazil, in 1830,” Journal of Latin American Studies, 36 (2004): 1–28).\n\nSee, for example, the debate launched by Robert W. Slenes in 1999 with his book Na senzala, uma flor: esperanças e recordações na formação da família escrava–Brasil sudeste, século XIX (Rio de Janeiro: Ed. Nova Fronteira, 1999). He returns there to the question raised, four years earlier, by Hebe Maria Mattos de Castro in Das cores do silêncio: os significados da liberdade no sudeste escravista, Brasil século XIX (Rio de Janeiro: Arquivo Nacional, 1995), namely, what was the impact of an owner's promises of manumission on the cohesion of immediate and extended families?\n\nSebastião da Rocha Pitta, História da América Portugueza, desde o anno de mil e quinhentos do seu descobrimento, até o de mil e setecentos e vinte e quatro (Lisboa: Officina de Joseph Antonio da Silva, Impressor da Academia Real, 1730), livre 8, § 25–40; Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins, O Brasil e as colônias portuguezas (Lisboa: Livraria Bertrand, 1880); Raimundo Nina Rodrigues, Os africanos no Brasil; Ernesto Ennes, As guerras nos Palmares–subsídios para a sua história (São Paulo: Cia Editora Nacional, 1938); Edison Carneiro, O quilombo dos Palmares (São Paulo: Cia Editora Nacional, 1958); Clóvis Moura, Rebeliões da senzala: quilombos, insurreições, guerrilhas (São Paulo: Ed.

We take special note of Maria Lêda Oliveira's publishing of the oldest document available on Palmares (early seventeenth century): ”A primeira Rellação do último assalto a Palmares,” Afro-Ásia, 33 (2005): 251–324. An initial summary of the reinterpretation of Palmares can be found in the contributions of João J. Reis and Flávio dos Santos Gomes in the collective book they edited, Liberdade por um fio: história does quilombos no Brasil (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 1996). For archeology, see in the same the contributions of Pedro Paulo and Abreu Funari. Flávio dos Santos Gomes published a summary of this story in Palmares (São Paulo: Contexto, 2005). It has been contested by Silvia Hunold Lara in an article written in French where she insisted on the “diplomatic” dimension of the event (“Marronnage et pouvoir colonial: Palmares, Cucaú et les frontières de la liberté au Pernambouc à la fin du XVIIe siècle,” Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales, 62, 3 (2007): 639–662). One of the most recent summaries comes from the authors of the collected volume edited by Flávio Gomez, Mocambos de Palmares.

The first would only be translated into Portuguese in 1971, then into English in 1978 as The African Religions of Brazil: Toward a Sociology of the Interpenetration of Civilizations (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978).

Eisenberg’s article “Ficando livre: As alforrias em Campinas no século XIX,” Estudos Econômicos, 17, 2 (1987): 175–216, etc. As we can see, these are all American researchers, proof that Brazilian themes were immediately incorporated into the discussion going on in the United States, in which the publication of Ira Berlin's book, Slaves without Masters. The Free Negro in the Antebellum South (New York: Pantheon, 1975) had been a landmark moment.\n\nThe dissertation was written and defended in France in 1992, where Kátia Mattoso was teaching at the time, under the title “Retrouver une identité: jeux sociaux des Africains de Bahia (vers 1750–vers 1890).”\n\nThe BDTD (Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Teses e Dissertações), a division of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology, has made available online all of the masters and doctoral theses defended since 2000 (http://bdtd2.ibict.br/). Several universities have also uploaded to their own websites older doctorates. We must keep in mind that mestrado dissertations in Brazil are often as important as doctoral ones and that a great number of them were and continue to be published immediately.\n\nSee, for example, the revised Portuguese reissue of Stuart Schwartz's “Recent Trends in the Study of Slavery” as “A historiografia recente da escravidão brasileira,” in Stuart Schwartz, Escravos, roceiros e rebeldes (Bauru, SP: Editora da Universidade do Sagrado Coração, 2001), pp. 48–57, as well as the annotated bibliography (restricted to the problems of the transition from slavery to free labor) published in the United States by Rebecca J. Scott, Thomas C. Holt, Frederick Cooper, and Aims McGuinness: Societies after Slavery: A Select Annotated Bibliography of Printed Sources on Cuba, Brazil, British Colonial Africa, South Africa, and the British West Indies (Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2002), pp. 323–411.\n\nHerbert S. Klein and Francisco Vidal Luna, Slavery in Brazil.\n\nThe journal Afro-Ásia is available online at http://www.afroasia.ufba.br/. A second journal, Estudos Afro-Ásiaticos, established in 1978 in Rio de Janeiro, aims to cover the same areas of research and debate. Estudos is more focused on the Afro-Brazilian question than its Bahian counterpart, and on its website it describes itself as “dedicated to the study of race relations in Brazil and the black diaspora, as well at the current situation and international relations of African and Asian countries.” Nonetheless, it has given a lot of space to historians of slavery among its staff as much as in its columns. It has only been partially uploaded to the internet, which makes access to its issues and therefore any wide-scale analysis of its publication history more difficult. The general history journals (there are more than 400 in Brazil) are ranked by the CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior) from A1 to C (A1, A2, B1 to B5, C). Afro-Ásia has been ranked B1 in 2013.\n\nAntônio Sérgio Guimarães would leave the UFBa for the USP the next year and step down from editorial responsibilities. In the team, he had been the specialist on Afro-Brazilian questions.

If it was already commonplace for freedmen to be brought back into captivity, it became even easier to do so with the coartação: the parties could disagree over the sum of the debt owed or the clauses decided on beforehand, obfuscate the length of the fixed term, and manipulate the dates. On the other hand, this confusion also benefited slaves who were in the process of being manumitted [...]: in this sense, the cortação system became one aspect of the strategies that slaves managed to elaborate with patience, courage, and, frequently, cunning.” Laura de Mello e Souza, Norma e conflito, p. 169.\n\nBeatriz Gallotti Mamigonian first wrote a master’s thesis on this topic, “Theatre of Conflicts: the Anglo-Brazilian Mixed Commission Court in Rio de Janeiro, 1827–1845,” (University of Waterloo [Ontario], 1995) followed by a doctoral dissertation: “To be a Liberated African in Brazil: Labour and Citizenship in the Nineteenth-Century” (University of Waterloo, 2002). Leslie Bethell, in England, had provided the political and diplomatic context of the abolition of the Atlantic trade in The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970).\n\nBeatriz Gallotti Mamigonian, “Do que ‘o preto mina’ é capaz: etnia e resistência entre Africanos livres,” Afro-Ásia, 24 (2000): 71–95; “José Majojo et Francisco Moçambique, marins sur l’Atlantique. Reconstruire les trajectoires de vie des esclaves à l’âge des abolitions,” Brésil(s). Sciences humaines et sociales, 1 (mai 2012): 103–124. The same phenomenon would be studied later in the Bahia by Ricardo Tadeu Caíres Silva in his mestrado and then his doctoral dissertation, defended in 2007 (see in Afro-Ásia, “Memórias do tráfico ilegal de escravos nas ações de liberdade: Bahia, 1885-88,” 35 (2007): 37–82), and in São Paulo by Enidelce Bertin in her doctoral dissertation, “Os meia-cara. Africanos livres em São Paulo no século XIX,” defended in 2006 at USP. Some excerpts from the latter were published with the title “Reivindicações e resistência: o não dos Africanos livres (São Paulo, séc. XIX),” Afro-Ásia, 40 (2009): 105–143.\n\nSee, for example, the rather acerbic exchange between Chalhoub and Needell in the columns of Afro-Ásia over the review of the latter's book (The Party of Order: the Conservatives, the State, and Slavery in the Brazilian Monarchy, 1831–1871, [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006]) by the former: Sidney Chalhoub, “Os conservadores no Brasil Império,” Afro-Ásia, 35 (2007): 317–326 and Jeffrey D. Needell, “Resposta à Sidney Chalhoub e à sua resenha ‘Os conservadores no Brasil império,” Afro-Ásia, 37 (2008): 291–301.\n\nSidney Chalhoub showed the role played by the novelist Machado de Assis in the process of interpretation. He had been, in the 1870s and 1880s, head of the bureau in charge of the supervision (and therefore the interpretation) of the law of the Free Womb for the Ministry of Agriculture; in 1878 he also became a member of the commission to reform the agricultural law; see Sidney Chalhoub, Machado de Assis historiador (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 2003).\n\nSeeJoão José Reis and Flávio dos Santos Gomes, eds., Liberdade por um fio.

Urban slavery in the Bahia is, of course, given great attention in all of Kátia de Queirós Mattoso's social historical work, especially her Être esclave au Brésil.\n\nIn fact, urban slavery and the modalities specific to it in Rio de Janeiro were studied early on in the pioneering work of the American historian Mary C. Karasch, in her dissertation defended in 1972 (“Slave Life in Rio de Janeiro, 1808–1850”), published in English in 1987 under the same title by Princeton University Press and translated into Portuguese in 2000 as A vida dos escravos no Rio de Janeiro (1808–1850) (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras). After hers, the three principal works on the subject are those of Leile Mezan Algranti in his mestrado dissertation, defended at the USP in 1983 and published under the title O Feitor Ausente: estudo sobre a escravidão urbana no Rio de Janeiro 1808–1822 (Petrópolis: Vozes,1988); of Marilene Rosa Nogueira de Silva in her 1986 mestrado (“O Escravo ao Ganho: Uma nova face da Escravidão”) published under the title Negro na Rua: a nova face da escravidão (São Paulo: Hucitec, 1988); and that of Luiz Carlos Soares in his PhD dissertation defended in London in 1988, the essential parts of which can be found in Portuguese under the title O povo de “cam” na Capital do Brasil: a escravidão urbana no Rio de Janeiro do século XIX (Rio de Janeiro: Faperj, 2007).

For Gilroy, the black Atlantic was a fundamentally northern space whose links to the African continent remained mythical and which, in a certain sense, was not readily analogous to the case of Brazil.\n\nFor a long time, research on the Atlantic trade was limited almost exclusively to historians from the U.S. (Philip Curtin first, then David Eltis and David Richardson and, on Brazil more specifically, Herbert S. Klein). One of the first Brazilians who worked on this topic was Maurício Goulart (A escravidão africana no Brasil (das origens à extinção do tráfico) (São Paulo: Livraria Martins Editora, 1949), whose numbers, judged to be too low (2.5 to 3 million captives brought from Africa) and were revised in the United States by Robert Conrad and in Brazil by Luiz Felipe de Alencastro in the 1970s and 1980s. It was in this same period that the development of numerous regional studies permitted a consensus to be reached around a number, today estimated to be 5.5 million men and women.\n\nLuís Vianna Filho, O negro na Bahia (Rio de Janeiro: Livraria José Olympio, 1946); see also Pierre Verger, Flux et reflux.\n\nManolo Florentino, Alexandre Vieira Ribeiro, Daniel Domingues da Silva, “Aspectos comparativos do tráfico de Africanos para o Brasil (séculos XVIII e XIX),” Afro-Ásia, 31 (2004): 83–126. In 1991, Florentino defended his dissertation on the traffic in slaves towards Rio de Janeiro: cf. Manolo Florentino, História do tráfico atlântico de escravos entre a África e o Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro: Arquivo Nacional, 1995; republished under the title: Em costas negras: uma história do tráfico de escravos entre a África e o Rio de Janeiro (séculos XVIII e XIX) (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 1997).\n\nRoquinaldo Ferreira, “Escravidão e revoltas de escravos em Angola (1830–1860),” Afro-Ásia, 21-22 (1998–1999): 9–44.

All the while asking new questions, she conducted an investigation of Benguela in which she discovered material of a similar type to those uncovered by Ferreira in Luanda.

Nonetheless, in the absence of brotherhoods similar to those in the Iberian empires, their enumeration is useful primarily for a quantitative analysis of the flow of imported slaves. The one exception is Gwendolyn Midlo Hall's database on Louisiana, and the research based on it in which she sought to analyze the different inheritances from Africa and the identities attached to them.
