The modernization and westernization processes continued in the aftermath of Egyptian independence (1922) and the declaration of the Republic (1923) in Turkey. One of the main outcomes of modernization in Turkey and Egypt was the secular policies, which were positioned in the center of state-religion relations. After 1980, liberal political and economic developments triggered the social, economic and political transformation in Turkey and Egypt, which are two close allies of the Western countries in the Middle East. However, Turkey and Egypt’s modernization processes gave different outcomes within three decades in term of democratization. By 2010, Turkey enjoyed the rise of democratic values while the military, one of the most prominent symbols of the secular regime, was losing its dominance in politics. A series of public demonstrations, known as “the Arab Spring”, shook Egypt in late 2010, and caused the fall of the Mubarak regime. Therefore, this dissertation aims to compare the modernization processes of Turkey and Egypt and their responses to change. I outline this study in two parts. First I analyze the social, economic and political developments of the two countries through their main political actors and institutions in a comparative perspective. Later, in case study part, I analyze the political actors that played a significant role in modernization and democratization: the Muslim Brotherhood, the Milli GÃ¶rÃ¼ş Movement and the AK Party. I also examine the socio-religious movement, the GM, and the MB through its social perspective. By doing this, I follow a parallel comparison pattern for the cases. In this dissertation, I will adopt the comparative historical method. In order to achieve the objectives, I will do historical analysis and study the sociological-structural, ideological and political behavioral aspects of the cases. In terms of the data sources, this dissertation will include content analyses and tertiary sources.\n\nALMEIDA, Andreia da Silva, Health in the Estado Novo of Salazar (1933-1968): Policies, systems and structures, PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Maria de FÃ¡tima Reis and Carlos Guardado da Silva, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/30337)\n\nKeywords: Health Policies; Estado Novo; Salazarism; Health System; Health Structure\n\nAbstract: This study focuses on health policies implemented by Salazar’s Estado Novo, from the beginning of the regime, in 1933, to its end, in 1968. In a global perspective, we analyze the evolution of several health subsystems - sanitary, caring and welfare - and their corresponding sanitary structures, emphasizing the evolution of the hospital sector, which would become pivotal for the regime. Similarly, we observed the organic evolution of the health sector, considering its fragmentation in several ministries, focusing, however, the political evolution of the Subsecretariado de Estado da AssistÃªncia Social and of its succeeding MinistÃ©rio da SaÃºde e AssistÃªncia. In a comparative assessment, we noted some international influences in the health area, namely regarding the relations with W.H.O. and the echoes, in Portugal, of the creation of the National Health System, in the United Kingdom. Assuming a global perspective, we analyze some critical voices against regime’s political orientation in the health sector, in particular the criticism of the Portuguese Communist Party (P.C.P.), the political pressure of the Portuguese medical association (Ordem dos MÃ©dicos) and of certain sectors of public opinion, as well as some catholic movements. This study also studied the ideology of the regime regarding the state’s role in health care, in addition to the evolution of some sanitary professions and the relevance of its political purpose during this period. In an attempt to assess the results of health policies adopted by Salazar’s Estado Novo, we conduct an analysis on the evolution of several international sanitary indexes, both in diachrony and synchrony. Subsequently, we highlight the evolution on child and maternal mortality, which are the indexes by excellence of the sanitary level of any country, and the evolution of some infectious pathologies, such as tuberculosis, malaria, leper or syphilis. This study analyzed a set of influential factors of health policies - technical, scientific, technological, structural, economic and socio-cultural factors - and the results of sector policies assessed by health indexes evolution of Portuguese population. In fact, the Salazar’s Estado Novo health policies became a reflex of regime’s general policy, and the periods of crisis improve his evolution. The results of these health policies produced a fragmented, uncoordinated, unequal and non-universal health system, composed by a multiplicity of hybrid and weak subsystems, causing social inequalities. During Salazar’s Estado Novo, was observed a continuity of a caring, subsidiary, charitable and non-universal health policy. However, the evidences suggest an evolution in continuity, one organic, political and structural evolution with significant repercussions on health indexes. Ideologically, the regime maintained his official doctrine: subsidiary, charitable, caring, natalist, conservative and catholic. However, we observed a inconsistency between ideology and political practice, hugely increased in sixties.\n\nALMEIDA, JoÃ£o Miguel Furtado Ferreira de, Catholics and politics in the crisis of liberalism: the course of AntÃ³nio Lino Neto (1873-1934), PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Fernandes JosÃ© Mendes Rosas, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/10789)\n\nKeywords: AntÃ³nio Lino Neto; Centro CatÃ³lico PortuguÃªs; Catholic Church; Political Catholicism; Portuguese State\n\nAbstract: This thesis analyses the thought and action of a catholic leader, AntÃ³nio Lino Neto (1873-1961), within the context of the relationships between the Portuguese State and the Catholic Church, during the crisis of liberalism, which started in the last decade of the 19th century, and ended with the establishment of the New State in the 1930s. The public intervention of AntÃ³nio Lino Neto is framed within the political periods that the Portuguese State went through, throughout the crisis of liberalism: constitutional monarchy, First Republic, military dictatorship, and the New State. The Catholic political dynamics in Portugal are issued, taking into account the national political evolution, the relations between the Catholic Church and the State, as well as the changes of direction occurring at the pontificates of Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, and Pius XI. AntÃ³nio Lino Neto was an institutional man, full professor of political economics since 1908, and president of the Centro CatÃ³lico PortuguÃªs, from 1919 to 1934. In the period of the post-world war Republic, he held a leading role in the political Catholicism, which endeavoured to put in second place the question of the regime, by distinguishing the obedience towards the ruling powers from the criticism of unjust legislation. Gradually, AntÃ³nio Lino Neto lost his relevance within the context of the emergence of an autocratic power that, under formal separation between State and Church, recognized the social value of Catholicism, and that got along with a Catholic hierarchy whose power over the ecclesiastical organization was strengthened during the period under consideration.\n\nALVES, Carlos Alberto de Jesus, Angolan foreign policy in time of war and peace: colonialism and post-colonialism, PhD in Identity, Practices and Representations of the Contemporary World submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by AntÃ³nio Martins da Silva, 2014 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/31604)\n\nKeywords: Angola; Diplomacy; FNLA; MPLA; Foreign policy; UNITA; International relations\n\nAbstract: This study addresses the political actions of the armed liberation movements of Angola, namely FNLA, MPLA and UNITA, which vied for power during the troubled process of political transition, started in 1974 in that African country. This research addresses as well the foreign policy of the Angolan State led by the MPLA, which had created, in the 60’s, the Department of Foreign Affairs in order to seek support and strengthen the diplomatic action against the colonial policy of the Portuguese Estado Novo, while FNLA was been recognized by several countries in the African continent. Another subject of this study is the political commitment of the liberation movements, by means of their overseas delegations and collaborators, to obtain international support and recognition as the legitimate representatives of the Angolan population. This study also focuses the foreign policy of the Angolan State and the normalization of diplomatic relations with several countries, as well as the strengthening of cooperation, the fight against the apartheid regime and the end of the remains of colonialism in Africa. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, political parties in Angola participated in the first general elections, which were supervised by the United Nations in 1992. Ideological change in the Angolan State, in force since 1975, was inevitable and it resulted in the official recognition of the country by the U.S.A. and the institution of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP). After the civil war in 2002, the Angolan State has privileged relations with China, while maintaining traditional links with various countries like Brazil, Cuba, the former Soviet Union and other States, as it is reported this study.\n\nALVES, Maria do CÃ©u Garcia dos Reis Loureiro, Special education and school modernization: Historical-pedagogical study of the education of the deaf mutes and the blind, PhD in Education: History of Education submitted to the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Justino MagalhÃ£es, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/8687)\n\nKeywords: Deaf Mutes; Blind; Royal Institute for the Deaf Mutes and Blind; Branco Rodrigues Institute for the Blind; Special Needs Education\n\nAbstract: During its history, the Special Needs Education has been a topic cyclically reopened, whether by the renewal of technologies, the development of methods and manifestations, expectations of sociability, or yet by the overall improvement of pedagogy. That was the core of my thesis, which I set in the triangle: 1) Materiality / technologies / institution, 2) Communication / language, 3) Pedagogies and sociability. In this research, I have used a complex methodical descriptive, interpretive and conceivable. After the systematization of the main lines of characterization and the evolution of the deaf mutes and blind’s education, bringing together such different aspects as representations, methods, institutions and ways of care, pedagogies and pedagogues, I have resumed the history of that education in Portugal during the 19th Century. I have pointed out two stages of special institutionalized pedagogy, as were designed and implemented by Pedro Aron Borg and JosÃ© CÃ¢ndido Branco Rodrigues. Special Needs Education has been a challenge to the pedagogies of yesterday, as much as it is to today pedagogies; it has evolved from separation to positive differentiation, conciliating inclusion and specialization. Occurring within the historical context of the writing culture and in the context of mechanized production, sidelined economy and urbanization of the ways and habits of life, there were three cycles in the genealogy (emergency, implementation, innovation) of the blind and deaf mutes special pedagogy. Those are recurrent cycles formed by a method, a technique, a sociability whose enunciation and morphology assumed in each epoch, a specific configuration. The analysis-reconstitution, historical-pedagogical of the first cycle shows that, in the eighteenth century and under the Enlightenment period, correlatively to the characterization and acceptance of the educability of the deaf mutes and blind, teaching methods, centered in word, were created and disseminated. The methods of literacy of Jacob Pereira, of the Abbot of Deschamps and of the Abbot de l’ÃpÃ©e were released and pursued in different places. The combination of intellectual education with technical developments made possible the mechanization of some workmanship capacitating the blind to certain tasks of production and distribution - such as the typographic work-distribution and sale of printed (brochures, books, and notices). A similar evolution occurred with the deaf mutes that began to ensure certain routine work, framed in mechanical production circuits. The first decades of the nineteenth century were marked by the establishment of institutes for the deaf mutes and blind, in boarding school regime. They were boarding schools with workshops where a pedagogy of conciliation between intellectual education and training in the arts of workmanship was practiced, in which the graduates could inhabit and serve as professionals. In Portugal, this kind of boarding schools was marked by the action of Pedro Aron Borg, being pursued in the Casa Pia until the third quarter of the nineteenth century. The education of this specific group of special needs individuals benefited from further progress in the transition of the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth century, in which to the advances of medical science and of the psychometrics joined the intuitive pedagogy and principles of the active school. Particularly innovative and perfectly integrated within the European framework of that period was the participative pedagogy and sociability created and established by JosÃ© CÃ¢ndido Branco Rodrigues in the Institute for the Blind in Estoril.\n\nALVES, Paulo Bruno Pereira Paiva, The Catholic press in the First Republic: from the end of the newspaper A Palavra (\"The Word\") (1911) to the ConcÃ­lio PlenÃ¡rio PortuguÃªs (\"Portuguese Plenary Council\") (1926), PhD in Communication Sciences submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Isabel Maria Guerreiro Nobre Vargues and Paulo Fernando de Oliveira Fontes, 2012 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/21842)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nAMARAL, Augusto Jobim do, Criminal Discourse and Politics of Proof: on the Limits of Inquisitive Governance of the Contemporary Brazilian Criminal Procedure, PhD in Contemporary Studies submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Rui LuÃ­s Vide da Cunha Martins, 2011 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/20164)\n\nKeywords: Governance; Penal Policy; Inquisitorialism; Brazilian Criminal Procedure; Proof\n\nAbstract: The political field of criminal procedure - space ordering, pervious to reversals and interferences, overlaps and strains, not only determined by legal norms - carries a permanent exception aureole that its foundation and its transcendence. It is from the order of inquisitorial discourse that brings forward the lived governance on this degree, which lies to learn and to recognize it by its metamorphosis. On the fringes of these links between violence and law the settle argumentative structure is provided by three different plateaus, having the proof as the privileged disposition. The first plan relates to investigate the traces of inquisitorial style that ultimately serve the different environments of proof establishment, making the task able to confront the ideas’ path of criminal procedure in Brazil. In the second plan, the scene of the current aesthetics of the criminal culture is crossed by the line of force of the discourse on the penalty and worries, and then, with an analysis of the punitive and populist formations of the security dynamic. The governance inquisitive approach to the field of criminal procedure provides, finally, the uniqueness power of state, from a proof micrology, minutely the contemporary my themes of the policy framework in the Brazilian criminal process, laying the presentable face of decisive choices on the ground of its criminal procedural democracy. At this level, therefore, is the focus of the strategies of power and the folds of thought, greatly, endowing democratic values, assigned to each place in this landscape, original meanings.\n\nAMARAL, ClaÃºdio AndrÃ© Das Neves, Energy, local development and social modernization.

The leading questions were set, as follows: what kind of History was taught in the end of the colonial period and the different political and educational situations after the independence of Angola?; what was the training profile of History teachers?; which theoretical, historiographical and learning principles are references to the training of History teachers in Angola?; what are the theoretical and methodological strategies offered by the international cooperation of education for the development of Angola education, History teaching and training of History teachers?; which impact did this cooperation have in the curricular organization of general education subsystems and teachers’ training?; which interdisciplinary and civic potential involves the discipline of History in the opinion of the respective teachers in exercise? The documentary corpus was reconstructed from documentary sources of information, collected in Portugal and Angola’s archives and documentation centers, thus being Portuguese Overseas Historical Archive, National Library and Oporto Public Library, and Angolan Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Teachers’ Training Institutes (Elementary Teachers’ School, IMNE e ISCED), international organizations (UNESCO, BIE, CPLP, U.A e SADC) and through a survey, within a sample of the History teachers in Luanda province. The methodology used was based on the collection, organization and analysis of documents, questionnaire survey and analysis of the contents. We conducted an empirical research on the study of defined objects, namely: educational and curricular reforms of the general education subsystem; History curricula; the graduation of History teachers at the secondary and university levels; the instruments of international educational cooperation; the representations of History teachers in exercise, in relation to their training needs and interdisciplinary potential of the subjects. The achieved results show that the reference theoretical, historiographical and learning principles (for good citizenship) were not identified in the general History curricula, in teacher training programs and in international cooperation.\n\nANJOS, Maria Cristina de Carvalho dos, Tourism in the coastal axis Estoril-Cascais (1929-1939): Equipment, events and promotion of the destination, PhD in History: Regional and Local History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Pedro Gomes Barbosa and SÃ©rgio Campos Matos, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/8638)\n\nKeywords: History of Tourism; Estoril; Cascais; New State; PUCS\n\nAbstract: When in late 1928 the Sociedade de Propaganda da Costa do Sol appeared it changed the Â«Portuguese RivieraÂ» label dubbed to the towns of Estoril, Monte and Cascais, along with the idea that the climate was the travel motivation for foreigners. The Â«Sun Tan EraÂ» and the diversification of attractions at the resorts were then settled, and men like Fausto Figueiredo, Guilherme Cardim, Joaquim Ereira, Ãvila Madruga and Marques Mata would work on the improvement of hosting conditions for visitors and of the life quality of the residents. The military dictatorship inaugurated equipments and the Golf course, recovered nautical practices, and legalised the spell of the roulettes at the Estoril Casino (the only permitted across Greater Lisbon). Aware of the revenue of the tourist activity the New State soon took over the private management of the Sociedade Estoril-Plage and used its know how to develop Tourism in the Azores. The creation of the Secretariado de Propaganda Nacional, the proximity of tourist managers to the civilian dictatorship and the local acceptance of the right-wing ideals led to the promotion of the (nationalist and conservative) Â«PolÃ­tica do EspÃ­ritoÂ» on the events offered from the Casino’s stage to the waters of the Cascais Bay. In the mid-1930s the British presence in wintertime was balanced with the Spanish market in the summertime. That flow began after the arrival of political refugees since 1931 that were visited by relatives and friends during the hot season. It was the case of General Sanjurjo who planned the coup d’Ã©tat that in July 1936 started the Spanish Civil War. Rumours and innuendo would then seriously affect the arrival of tourists at the destination, whose international image was reformulated, along with the increase of domestic tourism, and the accomplishment of the urban revolution planned by the minister Duarte Pacheco (the PUCS). It was thanks to the equipments, infrastructures, leisure and image inherited from the 1930s that the Estoril-Cascais axis would succeed as playground of the European elites during and after the 2nd World War.\n\nARAÃJO, AntÃ³nio Carlos Candeias de, The Catholic Opposition to Marcelismo: The Case of the Capela do Rato, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Human Sciences of Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, supervised by Manuel Braga da Cruz, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.14/8527)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The vigil for Peace at Capela do Rato, organized in 1972 by a group of vanguard Catholics in protest against the colonial war, is considered as one of the cornerstone moments - perhaps the most important one - of the Catholic opposition against the Estado Novo and, in particular, against Marcelismo. That means the main objective of the vigil promoters was fully achieved: make sure their gesture would have great visibility and impact, for what two elements hugely contributed - the collaboration of an armed group, the Brigadas RevolucionÃ¡rias, and the reaction of the civil authorities. The latter opened a conflict with the Church, more precisely with the Lisbon Patriarch, D. AntÃ³nio Ribeiro -, for what would first be considered as a mere struggle episode of a Catholic minority elite against the authoritarian regime, soon evinced a complexity not yet studied. The present doctoral thesis departs from the episode of Capela do Rato to a broader analysis about opposition of Catholic inspiration in the sixties, attempting to contextualize it in the mindset at the time lived in Portugal and abroad. In that way it strives to provide a more informed and enlighten understanding of the way conflicts and tensions happened at that time and the ruptures created - but also continuities - in the period between the last days of the authoritarian regime and the revolutionary instauration of democracy.\n\nARAÃJO, Giovanna de Aquino Fonseca, Continuity and discontinuity in the context of globalization: a study about fairs in Portugal and Brazil (1986-2007), PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Margarida DurÃ£es, LÃ­gia Bellini and Jean-Martin Rabot, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/19709)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: In Europe and America, fairs have always been of great importance, surpassing their commercial role in cities and becoming, in many societies, repositories for cultural exchange and learning, in which passers-by from various localities congregate and establish ties of sociability. In the current period of propagation and consolidation of the ideology and practices of contemporary globalization, although peripheral capitalism sets in at a rapid pace, with the emergence of new places of consumption - such as supermarkets and hypermarkets, shopping centres and consumer portals - , the fairs continue to exist with multiple characteristics, numerous forms of sociability, a space of commercial and social mobility that materializes through the diversified transformations that took place, not only in the geographic location and products traded, but also in the ways of making the fair: acts, gestures, corporal performances, movements and sayings, stimulated by the social actors who frequent and pass through their labyrinths. These transformations are what aroused the interest in this study, that is, of perceiving how these traditional trades manage to coexist and resist the impacts caused by globalization in the present time. To answer this question, we had to take two paths: first to identify the impacts and then the strategies of continuity and discontinuity that the characters of the fairs had to assume in order to keep them as places of consumption. We realized initially that, in the face of the effervescence of globalization, even if the fairs seek to maintain and preserve some traditions, it is notoriously impossible for these traditional markets to remain unchanged over time. To better understand these tactics and strategies, we have chosen as the research’s focus the fairs taking place in cities of the Portuguese region of Minho - namely Ponte de Lima, Barcelos and Vila do Conde - and cities in north-eastern Brazil - Campina Grande-PB, Caruaru-PE and the fair of SÃ£o Joaquim, located in Salvador-BA. With the particularities that bring them closer and farther, it was possible to perceive, in a comparative way, the impacts of globalization in the fairs of these two universes. We have taken into account the historical, social, cultural and economic values of the host city. In order to answer our questions, we delimited the survey between 1986 and 2007, as we believe that important changes occurred in Europe during this period, and also Portugal adhered to the EEC. In Latin America, Brazil was experiencing the end of the dictatorial period and political re-democratization. Both processes contributed to the opening up of the market, the liberalization of trade, and the implementation of the neoliberal policy influenced by the globalized ideology of market capitalism in the face of the crisis of the states whose functions were in the process of being redefined. As for the impacts of globalization, we perceived unemployment, informality, migration and immigration, cultural diversity, identity hybridization, deployment of new places of consumption, adaptation to the new market logic facing the economic blocs, market opening to imported products, particularly Chinese products. In relation to the strategies and adaptations used by the marketers we detected the substitution of the goods and the forms of payment. In relation to the public power, we have noticed that, especially in Brazil, the search for recognition of these places as immaterial patrimony, highlighting the safeguard policies and the requalification projects of these places has begun. However, despite the re-significances and adjustments to the market dynamics, the contemporary fairs undergo a high crisis of survival, of discontinuity. If in fact the interests for its continuity are legitimate, it is necessary to adopt a policy of encouraging and valuing these emerging spaces. The methodology used privileged Oral History reports, but also a diverse set of sources of other types, including records from different public institutions and newspaper reports. In addition to interviews with marketers and customers, we used photographic and cartographic surveys. About 240 people were interviewed (120 in Brazil and 120 in Portugal). We have chosen to preserve the identities of the deponents by assigning them pseudonyms.\n\nAZEVEDO, Ana Carina Gerardo da Silva, Scientific Management in Portugal after Second World War (1945-1974), PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Maria Fernanda Rollo, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/14102)\n\nKeywords: Scientific Management; Innovation; “Estado Novo”\n\nAbstract: Since the beginning that the concerns with the introduction of improvements in work efficiency are present in the working world. Although, the use of scientific methods in its study, planning and organization emerged only in the early years of the 20th century with the aim of increasing the income by eliminating the waste of time, effort and materials. As a rule, we got used to immediately connotate the subject with the realities of countries such as United States of America, France, Germany or Japan. However, in fact, these principles have spread practically throughout the industrialized or industrializing world, having been developed interesting experiences also in South America, Oriental Europe or in peripheral countries of South Europe, among which, Portugal. In fact, in Portugal, the first indications of reflection around these principles arise still during the period of the First Republic, in small articles published in some periodicals of the time. However, it is after the World War II that further studies and the application of scientific methods of work organization has its time of greatest development. It is, in fact, in this period that begins what we might call as the \"golden age\" of scientific management in the country, in which are created private and state organisms which aim to disseminate these principles not only industrially, but also agricultural and administratively. The logic of the time is not oblivious to this reality, being entangled in the dynamics of the North-American technical assistance, the inclusion of Portugal in the bodies of economical cooperation and being influenced by other international impacts, as well as by how all these elements relate to the challenges that Portugal faced at the time, with the pursuit of productivity and with the awareness of the need to overcome the weaknesses that have been revealed during the World War II and by the preparatory studies of Development Plans. In fact, trace the history of scientific management in Portugal is to trace a narrative in two planes, in which the external impulses are evident, but whose dynamics are assumed by a support platform that, in this country, was bet in the importance of improving the efficiency in the industry and in Public Administration by applying these principles. Therefore, we are before a State that, also through this via, industrializes and modernizes, that grows in functions and staff; that is driven to meet new challenges; that engages and receives impacts from movements and international organisms in a world that is increasingly interconnected. The winds of time are blowing in Portugal through the door that was left open by the decision of Â«not be left outÂ». The study that is here presented will, in this way, identify the vehicles that led to the introduction of scientific management in the country and the dynamics that netted and defined them at the national and international level, without forgetting the actors, goals and resistances involved.\n\nBAIÃA, Manuel Pimenta Morgado, Elites and Political Organization on the First Portuguese Republic: The case of the Nationalist Republican Party (1923-1935), PhD in Contemporary History submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Helder Adegar Fonseca and Nuno Severiano Teixeira, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/11621)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: This thesis has as its main aim the study of the Nationalist Republican Party (1923-1935). It portrays and analyses its action on the core of the political power, on the parliament and government at the final stage of the First Republic (1923-1926). It studies its characteristics following four topics: internal organization, membership, the elite and ideology. Lastly, its decadence and dissolution (1926-1935) during the Military Dictatorship and the New State is studied.\n\nBAPTISTA, VirgÃ­nia do RosÃ¡rio, Protection and rights of working women in Portugal: the origins of the welfare state, PhD in Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by FÃ¡tima SÃ¡ e Melo Ferreira, 2013\n\n(http://hdl.handle.net/10071/6225)\n\nKeywords: Working women; Motherhood; Mutualism; Welfare state\n\nAbstract: The aim of this work is to reflect on social assistance, social welfare and the rights of working women in Portugal between 1880 and 1943. 1880 sets the beginning of our study on mutualistic associations and respective regulations. 1943 was the year when for the first time all workers were paid a family allowance. In Portugal women represented more than a quarter of the working class population. Though birth rates were high during this period, we could verify that childhood mortality was also high in the first year of life. This caught health professionals’ attention to the perils of “race degeneration”. All these problems motivated us to research into the origins of the Welfare State and the female condition. Bearing in mind these two facts, we decided to work out on the answers to three fundamental questions: What laws enabled assistance and protection to working mothers; which associations carried out that kind of assistance; what steps the governments took to tackle the scourge of childhood mortality. The working class strongly supported the mutualistic movement and therefore in this study it is important to find out how mutual associations planned motherhood protection. Xabregas, in Beato parish, in Lisbon, was chosen as a case-study because this neighborhood had an important and strong female working community, and so we aim to understand how the daily routine of the families of working mothers was.\n\nBARBOSA, MÃ¡rcio SÃ©rgio Costa, Marcelist Estado Novo (1929-1974), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Rui Cunha Martins, 2015\n\n(https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/28990)\n\nKeywords: Marcello Caetano; Marcelism; Estado Novo; Corporatism; Welfare State; Overseas; Powers\n\nAbstract: The present doctoral thesis has as object of study Marcello Caetano (MC) and his form of “Novo Estado”, as a reproduction of the regime implemented with the 1933 Constitution but distinct from Salazar’s type of “Estado Novo”. A wide range of issues, such as knowing why an experimental restoration of ‘functionality’ in a system that had been, until then, ‘dysfunctional’ but ‘successful’, as well as knowing why the central political agent ‘collapsed’ when faced with opposing, and even contradictory forces, groups and powers, justify a contextualized historiographic analysis, one being an interpretation of the marcelist social, political and economical project and the relationship between MC, the itineraries of the Novo Estado, the fundamental problems of its historic time, the powers or groups of powers and the critical analysis of the of the evolution of the international context, and the other from internal viewpoint (obligatory and necessarily critical), by MC himself and by marcelism - in all its multiple aspects and vicissitudes. The analysis is based on three points. The first one contextualizes the early period, until 1929, when MC began collaborating with the head of the \"Situation\". Then, we seek to break down the thoughts of MC according to his world view rather than rebuild an early and systematized version of his thought. We examined, in detail, his positions and views on the construction and evolution of the regime, as well as its relationship with the period it is set in. His views on the international context were also an aim of this study, assessing the impact of the main events in the political and intellectual formation of MC until 1939. The experience of power, together with the most important event of the twentieth century, constitute a factor of transformation that advises against the hasty taking up of positions temporarily too far apart. The next point examines in depth, and where documentation allowed, from many perspectives - not just political, how MC began positioning himself within the center of the regime until 1968. All elements of conflict between MC and individuals, institutions, groups or power structures infiltrated by the regime were decoded. The extent to which his experience in the “Mocidade Portuguesa (MP) determined future actions is studied. The notion of \"power\" in the thought of MC and, above all, how the first contact with the \"powers\" is deepened, and how MC’s exit from the Colonies section (1947) and the Presidency (1958) were arranged. The so called \"crossing of the desert\" (1958-68), is analyzed in depth, looking at its causes and consequences, highlighting the complex issue overseas. His positioning in relation to the international setting and the major powers and the central issues of this period in the Western world, the future of liberalism and of the concept of freedom are analyzed in detail, as well as the processes of exploitation of these and other concepts. Finally, MC’s various times in Government, with special emphasis on the Ministry of the Colonies (1944-47) and the Presidency of the Council (1968-74) periods are described with all their complexities. To this end, the theoretical liberal reference that marked this period is taken into consideration and MC’s interaction with the evolution of the political-economic system is analyzed. Seeking an alternative viewpoint, the corporate “organization of all interests\" and their implication in the construction of the \"Novo Estado” of MC is also discussed. The extent of instability created by the new praxis and imbalances caused within the regime is assessed, as well as the preparation of the \"elections\" of October 1969 mapped out MC’s future and the new \"social State\" generation”. The in-depth study of the Ministry of the colonies is then described: its direct contact with corporate reality, the mechanisms of economic coordination and deep knowledge of African reality, the origin of the \"decisive\" confrontation of MC and their vision for the country with the \"structural\" powers. The connection between these \"clashes\" and the main decisions taken by MC’s government in the various fields of action, particularly the constitutional amendment of 1971 are also discussed in detail. Lastly, it concludes with a survey and evaluation of MC’s proposals within the complex framework of crises, struggles, hardships, reflections and contradictions that marked the Western world at that time.\n\nBARROS, JÃºlia Teresa Pinto de Sousa LeitÃ£o de, The Radical Republican Political Journalism. O Mundo (1900-1907), PhD in History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Fernando Rosas, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/13094)\n\nKeywords: Portugal history; Republicanism; Socialism; Anarchism; Radicalism; Political journalism; Political debate; Censorship; Journalistic conventions; Essays; Reportage; Interviews; Rumors; Entitlement\n\nAbstract: This doctoral dissertation analyzes the political journalism practices of the Republican newspaper “O Mundo”, during the early twentieth century. Political historiography of the liberal monarchy crisis tends to emphasize the role of the press, however this has never been a subject of a separate study by itself. The Republican daily press is often associated with other forms of disclosure activities of republican ideals (brochures, conferences, books, meetings, banquets, etc..), alienating it from political journalism of his time (by content and by form). The present study inserts the radical republican political newspaper “O Mundo” within the journalistic practices of Lisbon’s daily press, exploring mutual and differing views. Our comparative analysis seeks to answer several questions: What was the role played by the press in the political debate? What distinguished the daily press from the remaining journals? What distinguished political journalism practiced by the nonpartisan and partisan newspapers? How the political press debate was accessed and structured? What conceptions of political debate were present in Lisbon’s daily press? What was the role of information in the press debate? How the radical press enabled itself in the beginning of the century? What was the dependence of party structures? And finally: what are the journalistic practices that distinguished the newspaper “O Mundo” from the remainder or the press? We came to the conclusion that daily press continuously intervened in the political debate. However, in the absence of an informative press that claims interlocutor’s role, we highlight the place of partisan political journalism in the journalistic debate. We also stressed the growth of informal political boundaries in partisan political daily press, by means of a set of journalistic conventions. In this regard we referenced the shared appreciation for rumor or unconfirmed information as well as the difficult task of imposing the interview genre. The radical republican press distinguished itself by the ability to extend the scope of controversy and debate about the news and we highlighted the role of the reporter’s practices. The republican newspapers appropriated the mainstream political journalistic debate model, broadening the scope of political participation, by introducing new political controversy surrounding regime ́s social and democratic. The radical republican journalism contributed to an alternative political debate model; one that was more democratic, more competitive and had more inclusive content.\n\nBARROSO, LuÃ­s Fernando Machado, The political-diplomatic maneuver of Portugal in Southern Africa (1951-1974), PhD in History, Defense and International Relations submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by LuÃ­s Nuno Valdez Faria Rodrigues, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10071/6200)\n\nKeywords: Southern Africa; ALCORA; South Africa; Rhodesia; Portugal; Diplomacy\n\nAbstract: Between 1961 and 1974, Portugal fought a long war in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, getting an important support for its war effort from the international system. Important literature has been published in this area, particularly with regard to political and diplomatic relations between Portugal and the United States, Britain, France and Germany. However, we had yet to determine how the war in Angola and Mozambique was influenced by the relationships that Portugal kept with the countries of Southern Africa (Rhodesia, South Africa, Malawi and Zambia). An acknowledgment of the diplomatic dimension of the colonial war in Southern Africa provides an insight into the way the Portuguese government attempted to reinforce their traditional alliances starting with the act that incorporated the colonial constitution (1951) until the fall of the regime on April 25, 1974. The access to important data from the archives of the Foreign Affairs and Defence from South Africa, the existing documentation at the National Archives not fully explored until now, and a theoretical framework grounded in the idea of using diplomacy as an instrument of power, provides an overview of the innovative Portuguese foreign policy that complements the existing historiographical literature. The analysis of the political and diplomatic manoeuvres of the Portuguese Government with South Africa and Rhodesia, allows us to conclude that Portugal tried to strengthen its strategic importance in Africa as a way to balance the centripetal importance of Pretoria's strategy in its counter-subversion as the last \"white redoubt\" against the \"Communist invasion\". The approach to Malawi and Zambia and the encouragement of Ian Smith to declare unilateral independence (1965) as a mechanism against the hegemony of Pretoria, failed to offset the weight of Pretoria after its direct intervention in southern Angola after 1967. Furthermore, the degradation of the military situation in Tete from 1970, which Pretoria and Salisbury took on as the axis of subversion in Southern Africa, plus the investment in the \"provinces\" definitely pushed Angola and Mozambique to South Africa's strategic orbit.\n\nBELLO, Maristher Motta, Rolim's work of efficiency: oral history and life trajectory, PhD in History submitted to the Department of Tourism Heritage and Culture of the Universidade Portucalense, supervised by Zita Ana Lago Rodrigues and Henrique Fernandes Rodrigues, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/11328/579)\n\nKeywords: Visual Culture; Art; Instruction; History; Identity process; Cultural pluralism\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this paper is to discuss cultural studies, depicting art, history and culture conceptions, taking as reference the cultural studies of Raymond Williams (1972), Stuart Hall (2002-2009), Homi Bhabha (1998), Tomaz Tadeu da Silva (2000), Walter Benjamin (1985) and the debate among Jean-Claude Forquin (1993), Fernando Hernandez (2000), Philippe Perrenoud (2000), Jean-Pierre Pourtois (1999), Huguette Desmet (1999) and Gaston Bachelard (1962) amid others, crisscrossing them with the discourse analysis of Efigenia Rolim’s (born 1931) life and work. This Brazilian artist from Minas Gerais State discovered herself as an artist when she was 60 years old, creating stories and objects from garbage and candy wrapping. From her humble country life to the streets of Curitiba city, she built her way as a performer, creating the persona EfigÃªnia, a poet, a storyteller, an artist who shares the space of squares, schools and museums with melodies, clothing, sculptures and performances by discussing, in a playful and unusual way, universal and complex issues of post-modernity. The artist stated her work as art, a kind of art that her discourse wanders, in large squares and museums. Her work merges into others arts and is object of researching studies, such as an awarded film, papers, articles and publications from diverse fields. Nowadays, aged 80, with the strength and beauty of maturity, she finds space to claim the creation of the Candy Wrapping Alive Museum’s, a “ghetto” museum. Efigenia Rolim receives the Medal of the Order of Cultural Merit, in 2008, due to her work and performance, alongside national and foreign personalities who have distinguished themselves in culture. Facing exclusion and poverty, from a marginalized situation to a respected position, Efigenia Rolim’s work, sculptural and ephemeral, troubadour and theatrical, reincorporates contemporary subjectivity and teaches about culture, education and humanities. This research reveals that the boundaries amongst history, art and the life of the artist are fused with the complex postmodern world. The present study also draws a visualization to contemporary identities; in those, art, education and curriculum are combined, as well as an appropriate view to our diverse context: a multicultural and multifarious contemporary world.\n\nBELO, JoÃ£o Eduardo Nunes, From decolonization to the origins of Portuguese cooperation: Figures and facts, motivations and achievements, PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Ventura, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/24639)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The Decolonization of the Portuguese overseas territories took place in profoundly adverse circumstances due to constraints of various kinds. Assuming that the Revolution took place also in order to carry the colonial independence out in accordance with international law, it would be up to the military, in this case to the MFA, to safeguard, in peace and security of people and goods, the transition to the new realities. However, political and military interests interfered in such a way that led to a fast decolonization, but not faultless, as some would categorize, taking into account the frustrating consequences for both Portuguese and Africans. If the most well known actors of these remarkable episodes of Portuguese contemporary history were military in political office such as Spinola and Melo Antunes, and politicians such as MÃ¡rio Soares and Almeida Santos, there were others who, not having a job as prominent, were very important for their efforts. Of them will be equally imperative to speak about. The decolonization closed the empire cycle and opened the new European cycle. Turning on a new page, it was important to ensure continuity of the relationship, along new lines and mutual interest. The next stage, the most natural, pragmatically assumed, seemed to be the way of cooperation among free and equal people. This path has been very difficult for both sides due to the remnants of the past, ideological clashes and especially the negotiations for resolving the dispute, which came only to further deepen stances. But the bonds were not broken, and just a few years made it possible to return to the constructive dialogue and willingness to cooperate. Of this whole process, protruded Melo Antunes and Ramalho Eanes who, each in his own way, marked and truly influenced these relationships. Finally, it is essential to refer to the history of organizations that were created to monitor and support this new relationship, based on the richness of a common language and centuries of joint experiences. In its origin these organizations sought only to answer in solidarity to the overcoming of casuistic needs within a framework essentially of welfare nature. Sometime later, overtaken the cyclical vicissitudes there was a need to rethink the very philosophy of cooperation, models and performance practices. The priorities of the partners became more comprehensive and, seeking compliance, a new type of organizations, which supported a genuine cooperation policy and guarantee of continuity of the relationship between Portugal and the African people.\n\nBERNARDO, Maria Ana Rodrigues, Societies and Elites in the Municipality of Ãvora - Permanence and Change (1890-1930), PhD in History submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Helder Adegar Fonseca and JosÃ© Manuel Sobral, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/11096)\n\nKeywords: Social History; Urban History; Social Stratification; Elites; Ocupations\n\nAbstract: The aim of this research is to study the stratification of society in the district (concelho) of Ãvora and the composition and public action of its municipal elite from 1890 to 1930. Our examination of the social stratification profile of the district focuses on aspects of change and permanence, and our survey of the action of the local municipal elite highlights its role in the process of the modernization of local society. In our analysis of the stratification process, we focus on indicators of inequality: not only those of a material nature but also others associated with status and mechanisms used to access power. The intention is to provide a contribution towards a greater understanding of the contemporary social and political history of Portugal, an area in which little work has hitherto been carried out. Our investigation is founded on a case study of Ãvora and is based on primary sources, close attention being paid to local and regional specificities.\n\nBRANDÃO, Tiago, The National Board of Scientific and Technological Research (1967-1974). Organization of Science and Scientific Policy in Portugal, PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Maria Fernanda Rollo, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/8626)\n\nKeywords: Organization and Administration of Science; Scientific Policy; Scientific Institutions; Political economy; Scientific Diplomacy; Estado Novo\n\nAbstract: If the nineteenth century witnessed a growing social assertion of the scientist, namely with its institutionalization in societies, it is in the twentieth century that there is the affirmation of an earlier tendency of organization of science and, in particular, in a sense of construction of scientific policies at the national and international levels - under the impulse of processes of recognized historical scope, such as the construction of the modern state or the Industrial Revolution itself, and decisive events such as world wars or economic cycles (Great Depression and economic growth). Portugal, on the other hand, despite the impasses, resistances and peculiarities, will not fail to follow the cadence of history from the point of view of this relationship between Science and Politics. There have been many initiatives in the organization of science, supported by an interesting heritage from the point of view of thought and strategic debate on the role of scientific culture, to read in the light of the evolution of the conjunctures of the history of Portuguese political regimes during the 20th century, above all, to be understood in the light of the double process of institutionalization and professionalization of science and scientists, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of the legitimating narrative of political power and state in Portugal. The dissertation study that follows will identify and problematize the profile and intentions of the National Scientific and Technological Research Board (JNICT) - Decree-Law no. 47 791, July 11, 1967 -, and in particular, as it already has some specialized literature has been captured in a sense of the emergence of an explicit scientific policy in contemporary Portugal. To a certain extent, the creation of JNICT in 1967 as a foundational landmark of scientific policy is understood - in this regard, we intend to reveal the historical significance of this organism.\n\nBRUXEL, Laerson, Democracy, Deliberation and the Media in the Contemporary Public Sphere: a Study on the Referendary Experiences in Brazil and Portugal, PhD in Contemporary Studies submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Rui LuÃ­s Vide da Cunha Martins, 2011 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/20165)\n\nKeywords: Deliberative Democracy; Mass media; Rhetoric; Argumentation; Referendum\n\nAbstract: This study analyzes and compares the material published by two newspapers - Folha de SÃ£o Paulo, from Brazil, and PÃºblico, from Portugal, on the referendums that happened in both countries in 2005 and 2007 respectively. The purpose is verifying whether in this material there are discourses with arguments that might be considered useful to a deliberative process, in the perspective of democracy as it is defended by JÃ¼rgen Habermas. According to Simone Chambers, newspaper material is classified as either plebiscitary rhetoric or deliberative rhetoric. The former is characterized by the presence of more elements that do not contribute for the attainment of a public deliberation, whereas the latter contains significant presence of elements considered important for the development of this process. The reinforcement of some of its elements in the newspaper materials - this investigation assesses and quantifies which elements are privileged by the media - may bring it closer or apart of what is considered important for a public debate in a habermasian perspective. The decision on privileging one or another element is a choice that the media makes. Upon choosing, it leaves the border area, with many open possibilities, and starts a demarcation process. When it demarcates, it sets limits for either process. Taking into consideration that the media has ambivalent potentials, this investigation makes this assumption: it is not possible to define the role that the media plays in specific events of public deliberations, such as referendums, because in its material all the rhetoric elements are present, both those favoring and impairing the deliberative process. Nevertheless, given its production and publicizing reasoning, it reveals some of the limits that prevent it from complexifying the public agenda themes. The assumption made here is that its choices privilege the rhetoric elements that are in consonance with the logic of evidence, which is refractory to an argumentative process. It is temerarious to consider the media as a central forum for public deliberation because it privileges more elements that limit an argumentative process. If its power of scope may be taken as something potentially useful for carrying out deliberative processes in contemporary democracies, the mere availability of this apparatus does not allow us to jump to conclusions that its practice effectively contributes for the development of public debate. For its potential, and also for allowing that inside it also circulates material identified with a deliberative rhetoric, one could even see the media as a player able to play a complementary role, but not a central one, in the broader process of public deliberation. Under this light, one cannot dismiss completely the possibility that the material produced by the media triggers a deliberative process in society when it is appropriated of or reinterpreted in several ways by the various players of the public scope.\n\nBUSSOLA, Diego, The light of the capital: SOFINA and the regulation of electricity in Lisbon and Buenos Aires in the 20th century, PhD in Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by Nuno Luis Monteiro Madureira and Mirta Zaida Lobato, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10071/6356)\n\nKeywords: Regulation; Electricity; Utilities; Salazar; PerÃ³n\n\nAbstract: This dissertation analyses the relationship between foreign investment and government in two different countries - Argentina and Portugal - in the XX century. It focuses on the performance, regulation and relationship with the parent company of two electric utilities - one in Lisbon and the other in Buenos Aires - that belonged to SOFINA holding company. I analyze utilities, government and consumer interests focusing on conflicts between them. I also study the holding company strategies, which where developed by Dannie Heineman, in both cities during Peronism and Salazarism. Service fees, regulatory institutions and rate tariff problems are analysed to help explain the relationship between parent company, subsidiary company, government and consumers. Contemporary literature considers that powerful governments - like those guided by Salazar and Peron - had the capacity of imposing rules and implementing economic plans. PerÃ³n nationalized public utilities by expropriating several companies, while Salazar designed the Corporative State with the aim of establishing a centralized regulation of the economy. Nevertheless, I show that the SOFINA holding company developed management and negotiation strategies to avoid government controls. The continuity of the companies in private hands, the establishment of a special rate tariff system, the relationship with the regulatory government official and the existence of abusive service fees are examples of SOFINA’s capacity to escape political controls and advance its interests.\n\nCABELEIRA, Helena dos Reis, The artist while pupil: artistic education, cultural practices and conceptions of the self in the academic press of the University of Lisbon (1878-2007), PhD in Education: History of Education submitted to the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Jorge Ramos do Ã, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/8876)\n\nKeywords: Student’s press; StudentÂ´s associations; Education and self-education; History of the Universidade de Lisboa; History of artistic education\n\nAbstract: The artist while pupil: artistic education, cultural practices and conceptions of the self is a text which presents the results of an historical investigation centered on a systematic inventory, digitalization, and analysis of periodic publications produced by students of the Universidade de Lisboa. The process of constitution and analysis of a Digital Archive/Visual Catalog of the Student’s Movement Press (1878-2007), was developed around a central hypothesis: the possibility of identifying and mapping out a set of themes and problems that, since the late 19th century, were emerging in the student discourse, and configuring conceptions of education and self-education (formal and informal) centered on the figure of the artist and of the university student. As both the source and the subject of research, the student’s press is a privileged territory to investigate the historical conditions of emergence of certain psycho-pedagogical conceptions about the arts, and of a social imagery from which settled the bases of support of our present beliefs about what is an artist, and what has been the role of the school in the production of that way of being and living. What is presented here as a result of the investigation around the student’s press and movement, is a history of the pedagogical techniques, the artistic languages, and the technologies of information and communication, through which the modern student objectified and converted itself into a reality. From an iconographic and textual analysis of the contents of the student press, I will defend that it was through the progressive socialization of the techniques of literary-artistic representation and expression - writing and drawing -, that the modern school disseminated the mechanisms for social and personal distinction on which were founded our democratic myths about education, art and culture.\n\nCARDÃO, Marcos Henrique Ramos de Sousa, Tropical Fado: Luso-Tropicalism in Mass Culture (1960-1974), PhD in Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by LuÃ­s Nuno Valdez Faria Rodrigues and Ãngela Barreto Xavier, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10071/6181)\n\nKeywords: Luso-tropicalismo; Nationalism; Colonial ideology; Mass culture; Popular culture\n\nAbstract: Based in historical assumptions and commonplaces about the character of the Portuguese, the luso-tropicalism was a way to imagine the Portuguese community, which tended to highlight the natural disposition of the Portuguese for a settlement without prejudice of Â«color or raceÂ». Almost treated as a form of life, this particular way of reinterpret the history of Portuguese colonization won consistency in the last decades of authoritarian rule, when a series of rituals fostered the idea that Portugal was a multiracial country, geographically diverse and a politically homogeneous unit. My aim in this dissertation is to describe and analyse key cultural phenomena that spread luso-tropicalism in everyday life. I will argue that some artefacts of mass culture - namely football icons, such as EusÃ©bio, celebrities of Portuguese popular music, such as JoÃ£o Maria Tudella, Eduardo Nascimento, among others, and beauty pageants held in the 1970’s - managed to reiterate the main themes of luso-tropicalism outside the ordinary campaigns of self-justification. Besides the historiographical objective, this work also intends to point out the contingency of luso-tropicalist representations, which somehow disappeared immediately after the Portuguese decolonization.\n\nCARVALHO, Paulo Alexandre Marques Archer de, SÃ­lvio Lima, a Mystic of Critical Reason (about the unconditionality of Amor Intellectualis), PhD in History: Cultural History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Fernando JosÃ© de Almeida Catroga, 2010 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/14593)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nCARVALHO, Rita Maria Cristovam Cipriano Almeida de, The concordat of Salazar: Portugal-Holy See 1940, PhD in History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Fernando Rosas, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/5685)\n\nKeywords: Catholic Church; Concordats; Salazarism; Fascism; Francoism\n\nAbstract: This thesis on the Portuguese Concordat celebrated with the Holy See on May 7, 1940 falls within the scope of political history and is a comprehensive and systematic study of the negotiations based on original documentation which focuses on the views of the Portuguese State and the Holy See. This study is also an initial outline of a comparative study with other concordats from the time of fascisms. Salazar imposed its points of view, making an agreement in which the benefits for the church were far below the ones of other contracts, such as the Italian or the Spanish concordats, providing it with a plasticity that allowed its permanence in the Portuguese legal system until 2004.\n\nCARVALHO, Thiago Severiano Paiva de Almeida, Identity of spirit, difference of purpose: relations between Portugal and Brazil (1974-1985), PhD in Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by LuÃ­s Nuno Valdez Faria Rodrigues, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10071/14198)\n\nKeywords: Portugal; Spain; Foreign policy; Diplomacy; Luso-Brazilian relationship; Lusophone Africa; History of International Relations\n\nAbstract: From 1974 to 1985, the Luso-Brazilian relationship was characterized by the differentiation of objectives and strategies adopted by both countries and, at the same time, by their efforts to upgrade the bilateral dialogue. These political dynamics reveals a relationship marked by a paradox, exemplified by an effusive rhetoric about the Luso-Brazilian relations mostly as empty of substance. This evasive discourse evoking a special relation between Lisbon and Brasilia, apparently devoid of content, conferred certain centrality to a diplomatic relation while it could not be deepened or reshaped. The disconnection between the interests of both States became perceptible over the 60s and has intensified as the colonial question was approaching its end. During the time period analysed, the Carnation Revolution, the decolonization process and the transition to democracy contributed to clarify the significances the Luso-Brazilian relationship could have for both countries. The effort to reassess bilateral ties happened concomitantly with a debate on the international and national identity of both countries, which was deeply influenced by the effects of the Cold War on the global peripheries and by the post-colonial reality. The Lusophone Africa became omnipresent in the Luso-Brazilian diplomatic agenda, although with different connotations in Lisbon and Brasilia. Portugal, Brazil and the new Lusophone States have gradually established a relationship that influenced not only the Luso-Brazilian ties but also how the whole Lusophone space would be framed over the next years.\n\nCASTANHEIRA, Manuel Luis Pinto, For the history of childhood education in Portugal: The case of BraganÃ§a (1934-1986), PhD in Education: History of Education submitted to the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Jorge Ramos do Ã, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/10953)\n\nKeywords: History of early childhood education; BraganÃ§a; Pedagogical experiences; Pedagogical modernity; Estado Novo (New State); Post-25 April 1974\n\nAbstract: This thesis aims primarily at developing and extending the historical knowledge on the reality of early childhood education in the town of BraganÃ§a. It is intended to contribute to preserve local educational heritage and memory, by treasuring historical education in current society. This research intends to fulfil an existent gap: the lack of data and knowledge about the education of 3 to 6 year-old children. The answer is given by means of a study on the several kindergartens that were active from 1934 - when the first official kindergarten in BraganÃ§a closed downuntil 1986, when the first Framework Law on Education was published and the network of kindergartens started to expand in Portugal. The collection and systematic processing of data has been carried out on existing documentary series in several archives. These centres of primary sources are most of them limited to BraganÃ§a, even though research in other regions hasn’t been neglected for cross checking data. Focusing on a general pedagogical viewpoint, the problem raised here falls within the history of early childhood education in Portugal, where the main theses are recorded, and in the municipality of BraganÃ§a in particular. This research is believed to be crucial to understand kindergarten teachers and other teachers’ training. The thesis research paradigm is part of a hermeneutic standpoint that comprises qualitative and multidimensional interpretation methodologies and an extensive heuristic work and documentary analysis. Results show that the society of BraganÃ§a has managed to organise itself, by opening several kindergartens, despite the opposition of the Estado Novo (New State) to the expansion of this type of teaching. Kindergartens’ creation process was mainly due to private initiative, strongly upholding an educational and supportive framework, guided also by the key role of the Church.\n\nCASTAÃO, David MourÃ£o Ferreira, MÃ¡rio Soares and the Democratic Transition and Consolidation in Portugal, PhD in Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Sociology and Public Policy of ISCTE-IUL, supervised by AntÃ³nio Costa Pinto and LuÃ­s Nuno Valdez Faria Rodrigues, 2011\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The years during which MÃ¡rio Soares changed the course of Portugal. The fact that the transition in Portugal began with a military coup and not within the regime produced a crisis in the military structures and a crisis in the State, a combination that threatened the success of the democratic transition. Between 1974 and 1976, a combination of the military, an orthodox Marxist-Leninist party, and radical left-wing groups came close to leading to a disintegration of the state. Our goal is to try to understand how this scenario was avoided and what role MÃ¡rio Soares played in this context.\n\nCAVACO, Suzana Margarida Dias dos Santos, Average market in Portugal in the Marcelist period, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Jorge Fernandes Alves and Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, 2012\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nCODINHA, Miguel GonÃ§alo Cardina, Margin in a certain way: Maoism in Portugal (1964-1974), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Rui Bebiano, 2011\n\n(https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/15488)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: This study seeks to analyze the impact of Maoism in Portugal in the last decade of the dictatorship of the Estado Novo. It examines the different constellations emanate from this ideology, starting in the vertebration of Popular Action Front and Marxist-Leninist Portuguese Committee, in 1964, around theoretical and political assumptions who presented themselves as alternatives to those defined by Portuguese Communist Party (PCP). Former member of the Central Committee and the Executive Committee of PCP, Francisco Martins Rodrigues was the fundamental conductor of this demarcation, centered in the role of violence in social change, the contours of a politics of alliance to overthrow the regime and the alignment with China in the context of the sino-soviet split. Nevertheless, the short experience of the organization, strongly attacked by the PIDE (International and State Defense Police) in 1965 and 1966, produced a theoretical legacy reflected in the next Maoist groups. Characterized by a growing cisionism, these collectives developed some differentiated features from 1970 onwards, mainly after the appearance of groups such as MRPP and O Grito do Povo [The Cry of the People], later OCMLP. This organizations assumed a mass line and a embattled activism, clearly rooted in the juvenile and student environment, despite also appears in some located workers fields. Analyzing the practices and representations produced by Portuguese Maoism, the second part of this study is anchored in the concept of Â«imaginaryÂ» as a dynamic magma of meanings that result from human action and both drive them. The work observe how the image of revolutionary figures and territories, even distant, as the China of Mao, acquired a mobilizing nature, which stemmed less originated from knowledge of the country and more convened by energy of the imagination of this counter-reality. It also examines how Maoism has built a redemptive image of the proletariat, which led to the measurement of a number of political virtues and activated forms of transfiguration of the militant into proletarian.Are still traced the processes of construction of militancy, noting its essentially youth and student character, but also how the requirement of ideal crossed with the field of morality and intimacy. It also discusses how Maoism welcomed certain artistic and cultural practices which proved to be inseparable from the process of politicization. Then examines the position before the colonial war and the experiences that made up the multiform route that came from defection to exile. Finally, we study how this political ambience dealt with themes such torture, police inquisition and the political conflict in prison.\n\nCOELHO, Manuel da Silva, Timor/Portugal: Complex relations in the 20th century, PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Adriano de AscensÃ£o Pires Ventura, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/36450)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: We discuss East Timor, an old Portuguese colony in Asia. The twentieth century was a tumultuous period for the relations of Timor and Portugal. Since 1515, this eastern half of the island of Timor had belonged to the policy of European discoveries, where East Timor had become a Portuguese colony. East Timor was a society traditionally divided by kingdoms, under powers of rÃ©gulos and datos. The relations were very turbulent between kingdoms, where the beheadings were frequent. This was a period in which war between kingdoms and colonial power originated from the discontent of the liurais (kings in Tetum) about the regime change. The rÃ©gulos of Timor Loro Sa'e did not accept the end of the monarchical regime at the 5th of October of 1910, in Lisbon. In the same century, Europe of the economically strong countries organized themselves in warlike warfare, in order to take action by attacks to confirm their superiority over others. Germany was the central figure. It was a time when the Dutch fed and fomented hatred in East Timor against the Portuguese, through the natives at the frontier. The Second World War initiated by the West against Poland in September 1939, also dragged Japan and razed the Pacific. In February 1942, Japan invaded East Timor and applied ill-treatment to its population, not respecting Portuguese neutrality. The Japanese occupation of East Timor prevented the communication of the Portuguese governor, Manuel Ferreira de Carvalho, from Dili to Lisbon, in May 1942. He had been arrested at his official residence in Dili until August 1945 when Japan had surrendered. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the power of Portugal's colonial empire decided, through the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), on 25th April 1974 to grant freedom to their colonies to choose their destination. In addition to the colonies of Portuguese Africa, East Timor had the same rights to fight for its future. In the framework of party disputes, East Timor had been thrown into a storm that seemed to last an eternity. The complexity created by the opponents of independence ruined the country and its people faced a dark chapter of their history. The crossing in which it traveled consumed great human energy of the Timorese society in promoting its program for independence. The reborn capacities of the surviving political leaders to rebuild the core of the governing body resumed a new course of activity - a fact that would make it possible to certify the independence hypothesis of East Timor with the support of the international community.\n\nCORREIA, Manuel da EncarnaÃ§Ã£o SimÃµes, Egas Moniz: Representation, Knowledge and Power, PhD in History: Cultural History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Ana Leonor Pereira and JoÃ£o Rui Pita, 2011 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/15509)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: From a semiperipheral country as Portugal, the scientist‘s singularity of attaining, in 1949, the greatest scientific award of the 20th century - the Nobel Prize - has raised the issue of what sort of differences can be found in his path, in the reach of the results of his scientific work and in his life conditions could explain a such a high degree of recognition, when contrasted to other Portuguese scientists all the century along. In spite of the large, weighty and interesting available bibliography, including the Group of History and Science of the Interdisciplinary Centre of Studies of the 20th Century - CEIS20 published research, and under the scope of which we developed the present work, we have noticed three kinds of weaknesses to be deeply addressable and aiming to a more satisfying knowledge. Firstly, the circumstances surrounding the nominations of Egas Moniz to the Nobel Prize have been referred to the literature in a loose and incomplete way; Secondly, the generalised avoidance of polemics associated to the scientific discoveries Egas Moniz undertook, as well as of its stimulating role in the grasping of the problems these discoveries should be able to overcome; And thirdly, the mythmaking of Egas Moniz through a biographical bias omitting or barely referring to some central features of his social, cultural and political practices. The research undertaken in the Nobel Archives displayed a set of inedited documents containing vital information shading light on the process of evaluation and scientific rewarding that dominated the 20th century. It has been, in fact, the Nobel Prize that international consolidator of Egas Moniz‘s the image. This is a central aspect to the history and sociology of science, under the optic of Egas Moniz‘s representation, or under the perspective of the studies about scientific evaluation and rewarding devices during the 20th century. That is why the series of Egas Moniz nominations for the Nobel Prize and the reasons their peers invoked to nominate him must be confronted with the comments and appreciations signed by the Nobel Committee evaluators provide a good basis for the understanding of values and practices associated to the scientists‘s culture. Under the uncovering of the new revealed documentation it is a set of limitations become apparent. All of which derive from unclear adaptations of the Nobel‘s will and of institutional and organizational norms do not allowing an in time verification of the Nobel Committee acts. As well as one can guess in analyzing Egas Moniz dossier, the delay of 50 years impeding the public revelation of the founding for acceptance or refusal of nominated scientists, the arbitrary margin, the unjustified decisions and doubtful methods, all in all, have affected the Committee Nobel deliberations. Thus, we are aimed along our present work to 1st unmount (decompose) the intricate process of nobelization; 2nd pledge against the loose idea about the feeble political reach and engagement of Egas Moniz career; 3rd propose a redoing (recomposition) of the biographical profile in adding to it some features entailing a greater social, cultural and historic deep, underlying the main contact points between the individual and his epoch or to put it in another way, between the individual and the institutions; Moniz on his figurations, in the terms of Norbert Elias, or in the words of Wright Mills, in the intersection points between social structure and biography. Egas Moniz appears in ours present text as a set of representations ‒ built, thought and given to be read ‒ which we registered under the categorical denominations of identity fragmentation (referring to the persistence of lacunar biographies) and biographical power (deliberated conditioning of biographical versions) .Our proposal is based on the valorization of a culturally relevant series of biographic topics (what we call biographemes) and on their integration in the narrative about Egas Moniz, aimed to what we call an inclusive historiography.\n\nCORREIA, Roberto Paulo dos Ramos Franco, Linguistic asymmetries of the curriculum: The discipline of English in the Portuguese high schools between 1836-1974, PhD in Education: History of Education submitted to the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Joaquim AntÃ³nio de Sousa Pintassilgo, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/35220)\n\nKeywords: School subjects; Secondary education; English language; School programs; Teachers; English school books\n\nAbstract: This thesis analyzes from an historical perspective, the English language discipline in the Portuguese secondary school. The historical understanding of the process (s) of construction of a foreign language and its teaching in the lyceums of Portugal, constitutes the core of the dissertation. By inscribing this study in an historical perspective, we thought to contribute to dismantle the timeless and apolitical character that seems to characterize Linguistic Education. At the theoretical level, the research articulated contributions from the history of the curriculum and the school disciplines, as well as authors related to the issues of the globalization of school education. At the empirical level, the study defined a temporal arch between the beginning of the 19th century (1836) and the third quarter of the 20th century (1974). The moments of Anglophobia and Anglophilia that marked the course of this foreign language, during the 135 years of official education, were decisive in the course followed by the discipline until the conquest of its own space in the Portuguese curriculum. This study focused on legislation, disciplinary programs, teachers ‘reports, rectors and inspectors, school textbooks and the education and teaching press, as the main sources, adopting two guidelines that, although distinct, articulated and complement each other. The first one focused on the process of social construction of linguistic material, questioned the founding discourses that legitimized the passage of knowledge from the social tradition of origin to the school culture. It also inquired about the ways in which the discipline has been incorporated and articulated with the discourses that went through the school culture and how they changed when those changed. The second line addressed the function of the English language, in a perspective of the relation of knowledge and the effects of power on the different school actors. It was sought to understand, through the pedagogical forms produced, the way discipline disciplined and how this production, which was a part of the process of curricular alchemy itself, translated into specific curricular identities, gathered under the school sign of Linguistic Education.\n\nCORREIA, SÃ­lvia Adriana Barbosa, The politics of memory of the First World War in Portugal, 1918-1933. Between experience and myth, PhD in History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Nuno Severiano Teixeira and JosÃ© Medeiros Ferreira, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/5811)\n\nKeywords: First World War; Portugal; I Portuguese Republic; Veteran; War Culture; Memory\n\nAbstract: Constituting one of the most traumatic events of the history of the Twentieth Century, the Great War ended a global affection and turned neurologically all mobilized societies. In this paper, the politics of memory of the First World War in Portugal are placed in a European context, both as part of the sphere of cultural history and of political and social history as well. Recognizing the existence of an European culture of war, both homogenous and hegemonic, it seeks to understand the nature of the myth of the war experience in Portugal in an analysis that considers the profound divergences within Portuguese participation in the conflict within Europe, such as the disastrous effects that determined the specific process of commemoration and those that relegated to the possible condition of a mutilated victor. In dialectic between official, public and group memory, it attempts to examine in detail the politics of memory through official projects of commemoration with respect to the following points of analysis: the veterans as protagonists, their social integration and associated regulation; the processes of monumentalization of war memory (forms, rhythms of enactment and rituals of reassessing their significance). These axes can clarify particular questions: first, they explain up to what point the First Republic’s incapacity to project a consistent political memory and to deal with the traumas inflicted by the war reflects its fragility, precipitating its collapse in 1926; second, considering the historical definition of public spaces of memory, they can identify whether an official conception of commemoration actually existed in the base of the historical legitimization of republican politics; finally, considering the nature of commemorative processes, they can reveal whether the appropriation of the experience of the front for the war culture cultivated and legitimized the discourse of the political transformation after the war. In this sense, this exercise seems to deconstruct, on the one hand, the idea that the genesis of authoritarian regimes was a direct consequence of the war and, on the other, the notion that the war culture inaugurated a modernity rupture with liberal societies.\n\nCOSTA, Catarina Antunes, The Mozambican Institute and the Social State within FRELIMO, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Manuel Vicente de Sousa Lima Loff and Isabel Maria AlÃ§ada Padez CortesÃ£o Casimiro, 2018 (https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/118324)\n\nKeywords: Mozambican Institute; FRELIMO; Education; Health; Humanitarian aid\n\nAbstract: The Mozambican Institute was the organization that, under the formal cloak of independent foundation for humanitarian aid, allowed the Mozambican liberation movement to respond to the most basic needs of Mozambicans under its responsibility. The true welfare state that FRELIMO, thanks to the work of the Institute, could implement during the liberation struggle has allowed both refugees in Tanzania and the populations living in the areas gradually liberated in Mozambique to have a system of social protection that guaranteed them the minimum services in the areas of education and health, establishing schools, dispensaries and a hospital that responded to the needs of a population that, according to data of the Front itself, was one million two hundred thousand beneficiaries dispersed over an area of more than 250,000 km2, only in the liberated areas. All this work, besides granting immediate aid in the humanitarian and development field, allowed finding strategies that could be applied in an Independent Mozambique, aiming at the emergence of a new Nation, based on the presupposition of a new egalitarian and mentally decolonized society. The Mozambican Institute not only allowed FRELIMO to have access to international funds granted by Countries and some development and humanitarian aid organizations in Western Europe and North America that could not openly support a military organization presented by Portugal as terrorist, and also enabled the creation of true international networks of sympathy and activism towards the Mozambican cause.\n\nCOSTA, Fernando JosÃ© Monteiro da, Da capo al coda.

The present research takes into account the particularities of the textbook, as support and as a device for interpretation and its corpus the textbooks of music education, produced from the creation of CPES and by the year 2004. The conceptual scheme adopted investigates a set of information and concepts, which highlight the debate on curriculum resources, interpretation and control of curriculum, emotional transfer, organization models of the textbook, from which search results are guided, in part, to the questioning about what is the textbook, what is its purpose and the need to be around a more critical reading.\n\nCOSTA, LuÃ­s dos Reis Alves da, Morphogenesis and literary processes: from RenÃ© Thom to Henri Michaux, PhD in History, Philosophy and Heritage of Science and Technology submitted to the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Christopher Damien Auretta and AntÃ³nio Manuel Nunes dos Santos, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/18155)\n\nKeywords: Geometry; Aesthetics; Morphogenesis; Poetics; Meaning; Theory of Catastrophes\n\nAbstract: This dissertation is based on our assumption that there exists a correspondence between literary and topological morphogenetic processes. Although not unrelated to approaches characteristically moving from literature to science, our critical perspective prefers to move from scientific structures to literary forms, more precisely, from topology’s specific mathematical universe to the field of poetics and poetry. Several substantive issues are subsequently raised and addressed, such as: can a poem, or a corpus of poems, be analyzed by way of a geometric theory of spaces? Are artistic processes somehow determined by the same laws that pertain to stratification processes, conservation of structures, and properties of topological fields? If so, in what way? How does our understanding of the logic of forms influence, enhance, or condition our reading of the poetry in question? To what extent can artistic identity survive such intrusions by science? To lend support to our hypothesis, we have followed the work of RenÃ© Thom, according to whom there persists an independent substrate by virtue of which homologous properties are maintained regardless of their material basis. Thus, in order to identify a projection of objects and topological changes germane to literary objects and their respective transformations, we have opted to directly apply the conceptual foundation underpinning Thom’s Theory of Catastrophes to the poetic material basis. Furthermore, by doing so, we have developed our premise that poetics, itself a manifestation of linguistic phenomena, is the result of an increasing complexity enhanced by the structuring function of an axis of meaning. We would therefore expect to find homologous processes and stability levels, as well as commensurate peculiarities of border and transition, existing between topology and poetry, a finding which has placed RenÃ© Thom’s thought at the forefront of critical inquiry in the history and philosophy of science. Finally, as a case-study, we have applied RenÃ© Thom’s unique understanding of the fundamental elements of topological perspective to a comprehensive interpretation of Henri Michaux’s complex poetic universe. In light of our research path as outlined above, we have detected, identified, and characterized the dynamic presence of successive catastrophes in Michaux’s poetry, which in turn permits us to propose our hermeneutic grid as a theoretical model for further applications in the field of literature and science.\n\nCOSTA, Rui Manuel Pinto, Fighting against cancer and oncology in Portugal: Structuring and normalization of a scientific area (1839-1974), PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Jorge Fernandes Alves, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/50414)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Following very closely the global movement of the first quarter of the 20th century, the organization of the fight against cancer in Portugal surpassed some European countries, both on planning and edification of a project that became fundamental to medical and scientific national life. During the 20’s and 30’s, the risk triggered by the disease accompanied the deep transformation of the place occupied by medicine on public health, as well as its new role in a society that wanted itself to be molded under the sign of modernity. An anticancerous movement emerged then, mostly from a group of medical doctors connected to the academic world, in close link to the political cupolas of the time. Inserted between a growing medical specialty and the health needs of cancer patients, the Portuguese fight against cancer was the result of an association between several factors, exceeding the mere assimilation of new medical technologies or the creation of a proper space for specialized medical practice. It became a way to perform an intense health education program on behalf of the populations, a state of the art instrument for specialized medical formation, as well as a reference of scientific modernity in the Estado Novo context.\n\nCOUTS, PatrÃ­cia Alexandra Matias Gomes dos Santos de Antunes, All Poetry or Complete Poems: variants, fluctuations and textual practices in Herbert Helder, PhD in History and Theory of Ideas submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by JosÃ© Esteves Pereira, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/49838)\n\nKeywords: Herberto Helder; Textual history; Poetic practice; Editing techniques; Concept of complete poetry\n\nAbstract: The objective of this study is to tell a story: the textual history of the Â«whole poetryÂ» organized and published by Herberto Helder during his lifetime. As is known, the author has made numerous textual modifications in every text he published, causing the first text to become another text. It is intended, therefore, to make a historical journey throughout this poetic work, taking as its starting point the first edition of Helder’s Â«whole poetryÂ». This study will display all the textual changes that have taken place until they have reached the final shape of each text (the last volume of the Â«whole poetryÂ» published by the author during his life). Similarly, it will also be checked and indicated what has been taken out of the last volume, the last work in which that text appeared for the last time, as well as its own textual history.\n\nCUNHA, Adelino Filipe Saraiva da, Portuguese communists in exile (1960-1974), PhD in History: Change and Continuity in a Global World (PIUDHist - Inter-university Doctoral Programme in History) submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Costa Pinto, 2015 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/23645)\n\nKeywords: PCP; ExÃ­lio PolÃ­tico Funcional; Clandestineness; Estado Novo; Internatzionalny Dom; International Communist Movement; DÃ©tente\n\nAbstract: Ãlvaro Cunhal's exile, following his prison break in 1960, marked a new stage in the history of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP): for the first time, the Secretariat of the Central Committee was settled abroad, which favoured the gradual achievement of a number of collective Portuguese Communist exiles in Algiers, Moscow, Bucharest, Prague and Paris, including a group of children in Ivanovo. This transitory exile depended on the confluence of various personal circumstances and the fulfilment of specific functions abroad to contribute to the fight in Portugal. It is a Functional Political Exile and its application marked much of the 60s and allowed PCP to have great exposure to the intense contemporary dynamics of those times.\n\nCUNHA, AdriÃ£o Palmiro Bessa Pereira da, Humberto Delgado in “Salazar's Portugal”, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Jorge Fernandes Alves, 2016 (https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/90699)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nCUNHA, Alice da ConceiÃ§Ã£o Monteiro Pita Brito da, The Iberian enlargement of the European Economic Community: the Portuguese experience, PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Maria Fernanda Rollo, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/9076)\n\nKeywords: Enlargement; European Economic Community; Portugal\n\nAbstract: Between 1978 and 1985, Portugal negotiated accession to the European Economic Community.
