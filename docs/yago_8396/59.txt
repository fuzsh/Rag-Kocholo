Vatican City, sometime in the 20th century. Amedeo (Enzo Jannacci), a young soldier on furlough, wishes to see the pope to tell him a terrible secret. But the authorities of the Holy See try to dissuade him. After he decides to linger, he meets a crazy prince, greedy cardinals, and a beautiful sex worker, portrayed by an all-star cast that includes Claudia Cardinale, Michel Piccoli, Vittorio Gassman, and Alain Cuny. Ferreri built his 10th feature on the remains of a failed adaptation of Kafka’s The Castle. If a cinema of the absurd ever existed, L’udienza epitomized its themes. Courtesy of Cinecittà.
