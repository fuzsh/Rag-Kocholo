        "text": "Glauco, a forty-year-old industrial designer, goes back home after work. His wife is in bed with the flu. The maid prepared a cold dinner for him, but he decides to cook himself something else. While searching for the ingredients, he finds a package wrapped in a newspaper dated July 23RD, 1934 with the headline “Dillinger is dead.” Inside the box there’s an old gun, which Glauco strips down, carefully cleans and loads. As he takes care of the weapon, he eats his dinner, watches television and flirts with the maid. Meanwhile the sun has risen. Glauco goes into the bedroom and shoots his wife. He then leaves the house, and drives to the port where he boards a ship headed for Tahiti after being hired as a cook.\n\n“It’s dishonest to talk about films, since we’re already doing something useless which self-destroys itself. In silence. I made Dillinger Is Dead for several reasons: because I felt like doing it, because this film earned me some money; but in any case I’m doing something useless, so its pointless to talk about it.”"
