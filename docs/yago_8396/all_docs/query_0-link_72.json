        "text": "The Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF) on Monday added a David Lynch short and an episode of his iconic series Twin Peaks to its Franz Kafka retrospective and unveiled the program of its Out of the Past section, featuring classic, cult, rare and “unfairly overlooked” films, screened in their original or restored versions.\n\nAmong the highlights are restored versions of Wim Wenders’ 1984 neo-Western drama Paris, Texas and Two English Girls, François Truffaut’s 1971 period drama about a love triangle.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nBanff: Robin Roberts Talks Activism, Storytelling and Gloria Gaynor\n\nJust For Laughs Sells Comedy Catalog Amid Bankruptcy Protection\n\nDown Under Dogs: The Aussie Couple Behind Disabled-Pet Comedy 'Colin From Accounts'\n\nThe Wenders film is part of a three-film program presented by Alexandre O. Philippe, the creator of documentary essays about the history of cinema, offering perspectives on the American landscape in cinema. He will also present his 2021 documentary The Taking (2021), which explores American mythology through the socio-philosophical dimensions of the American landscape.\n\nAlso part of the Out of the Past program is Let’s Get Lost, Bruce Weber’s documentary about the final years of jazz legend Chet Baker. Plus, “this year’s ‘chapter’ in Karlovy Vary’s ongoing series dedicated to the king of American independent cinema, John Cassavetes, will show his final writer/director feature, Love Streams (1984), in which he and his lifelong partner and muse Gena Rowlands portray an unusual pair of siblings,” organizers said.\n\nKVIFF, whose 58th edition runs June 28-July 6, also unveiled more additional titles to complete the program of its Franz Kafka retrospective, which will pay tribute to one of the Czech Republic’s most famous sons in celebration of the centenary of Kafka’s death.\n\nThe retrospective, dubbed “The Wish to Be a Red Indian: Kafka and Cinema,” will show 13 feature films, four medium-length films and five shorts. The “surrealistic short film The Grandmother, which Lynch made in 1970 with financial support from the American Film Institute, as well as the third episode of\n\nthe third season of the cult series Twin Peaks, which most intensely reflects the admiration\n\nof one peculiar genius for another,” are now part of the lineup, organizers said Monday.\n\nAmong the newly announced films is also British actor Peter Capaldi’s directorial debut, Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life. “This playful and original short film, depicting Kafka struggling with writer’s block, won the Academy Award for best live-action short film,” organizers highlighted.\n\nCheck out the complete program for the two KVIFF 2024 sections below.\n\nOut of the Past\n\nTwo English Girls (dir.
