        "text": "In the unique retrospective “The Wish to Be a Red Indian: Kafka and Cinema,” the festival will present cinematic adaptations of works by influential and perhaps most mysterious figure of 20th-century literature. This year on 3 June it will have been a hundred years that Kafka died of tuberculosis at a sanatorium in Kierling, Austria.\n\nThe title of the retrospective comes from one of Kafka’s short stories, at the core of which are the themes of movement and transformation – ideas that define cinema as well. On the program are works by filmmakers such as Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese, Ousmane Sembène, Jan Němec, and Steven Soderbergh.\n\n“Kafka is one of those authors whose oeuvre has inspired filmmakers for decades,” says KVIFF’s artistic director Karel Och, who collaborated on the retrospective with the festival’s foreign consultant Lorenzo Esposito. Continuing, Och adds: “It’s as if he were slyly challenging us to try to capture, as originally and intensely as possible, the elusive nature of his writings, his stories, the realities he has crafted, and the feelings of apprehension he elicits, but also the comic situations he has created.”\n\nHeading the program is an original double feature of films by Steven Soderbergh, proposed to the festival by the filmmaker himself. In 1991 he shot the noir mystery Kafka, and thirty years later he radically re-edited his original material to come up with an entirely new version, Mr. Kneff (2021), that he calls “a silent movie with sound and music.” Other films in the retrospective include perhaps the most talked-about adaptation of Kafka, director Orson Welles’s The Trial (1962); Martin Scorsese’s unjustly overlooked After Hours (1985); and Artist of Fasting (2016), an adaptation of Kafka’s short story “A Hunger Artist” by the enfant terrible of Japanese cinema, Masao Adachi. Czech film is represented by the experimental and iconic Metamorphosis (1975), which Jan Němec shot while in exile in West Germany; Vladimír Michálek’s Amerika (1994), a postmodern adaptation of Kafka’s unfinished first novel that stands out for its unique visuals; and Joseph Kilian (1964) by directors Pavel Juráček and Jan Schmidt. An example of the Czechoslovak New Wave, this latter film may not be a direct adaptation of Kafka’s work, but it is definitely Kafkaesque.\n\nList of films (work in progress)\n\nThe Trial (dir.
