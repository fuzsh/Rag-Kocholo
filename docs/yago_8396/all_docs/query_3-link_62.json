During the war, he was active in the theater, but he first received serious attention in two film roles that made him instantly famous.\n\nThe first was a lively performance as the strolling minstrel and Devil's assistant, Gilles, in Marcel Carné's Les Visiteurs du soir, and the second the role of Hervé in Serge de Poligny's Le Baron fantôme, for which Cuny also collaborated on the script. Opposite Jean Cocteau, as the Baron, Cuny, the Baron's son and heir, created an unusual version of the romantic hero, reflecting the film's fantastic and legendary quality.\n\nThereafter, Cuny played increasingly realistic roles, and his performances became deeper and more psychologically complex. This gradual change was probably due to the influence of his theatrical work, especially after he began to appear at the Théâtre National Populaire under Jean Vilar. Cuny's first major stage success came at the 1947 Avignon Festival in Paul Claudel's L'Histoire de Tobie et de Sarah, and he also appeared in Vilar's subsequent production of Macbeth. In the mid-1950s he became a member of Madeleine Renaud and Jean-Louis Barrault's company; his appearance in their production of Tête d'or confirmed Cuny's standing as a great tragedian.\n\nIn the early 1950s he pursued a film career mainly in Italy, notably in an early Antonioni film, La signora senza camelie. Delannoy's Notre Dame de Paris, with Cuny opposite Gina Lollobrigida, was an Italian co-production. The emerging New Wave made good use of his capabilities, through his appearance in Louis Malle's Les Amants, but Cuny continued to make his most significant impact in Italian films.\n\nHis remarkable performance as the philosophizing author Steiner in Fellini's La dolce vita presented a seemingly quiet and even-tempered man, living happily with a beautiful and intelligent wife, who yields to a sudden, mysterious attack of folly and commits suicide. Cuny subsequently worked with Fellini in Satyricon. Equally important was the beginning of his collaboration with Francesco Rosi in Uomini contro, as General Leone, followed by performances in Rosi's Cadaveri eccellenti, Cristo si è fermato a Eboli, and Cronaca di una morte annunciata, which continued to demonstrate Cuny's skill and dramatic sophistication.\n\n—Karel Tabery"
