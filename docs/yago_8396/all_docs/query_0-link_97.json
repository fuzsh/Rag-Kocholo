        "text": "When Maestro James Levine was about to have his 40th anniversary with The Metropolitan Opera, Opera News editor Brian Kellow assigned me to write about my 40 favorite aspects of Levine's career. By rough estimate I had heard 1,000 Levine performances, but could easily have written about my 200 favorites before getting to those I perhaps did not like as much. The whole month this issue was on sale, with my article on the cover, when I would walk into the Met, I would see my work there. How horrible that Opera News is ceasing publication. https://lnkd.in/eR82h6mX"
