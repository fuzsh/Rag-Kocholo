In 2020 I hope to have the screenplay ready to shoot and to begin working with actors.\n\nQ5 – What is the one song you wish you wrote?\n\nJust one? The Smiths “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out”\n\nQ6 – What three bands inspired or continue to inspire you the most?\n\nArvo Pärt, Radiohead, Taylor Swift\n\nQ7 – Where can our readers see you live or listen to your music?\n\nAs this is the time of the pandemic, currently only on the internet and here’s the link:\n\nhttps://juliamarcell.lnk.to/skullecho\n\nQ8 – If your band was an animal, what would it be and why?\n\nAn owl – nocturnal, they fly silently, need a lot of space, have huge wings and can turn their heads 270 degrees. Then there’s also that fairy tale magic element to them that definitely appeals to me."
