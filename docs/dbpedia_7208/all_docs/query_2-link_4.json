        "text": "Results\n\nAt E14 arachnoid barrier cell specification is underway but incomplete, as arachnoid barrier cells (marked by E-cadherin expression) are present in the ventral forebrain meninges but are discontinuous in the dorsal forebrain meninges16. To compare the transcriptional signature of more mature arachnoid barrier cells to those that are likely actively specifying, we took our previously generated E14 mouse forebrain meningeal single cell transcriptome dataset16 and analyzed clusters expression some Cdh1 (E-cadherin), which in the meninges is only expressed by arachnoid barrier cells. The analysis identified three subclusters at different putative stages of arachnoid barrier development that we annotated as “Mature AB”, “PreAB1”, and “PreAB2” ( , ). Cells in the Mature AB subcluster had the highest expression of E-cadherin (Cdh1), Claudin 11 (Cldn11), and Klf5 (Klf5) ( ). Pseudotime analysis using Slingshot17 identified a distinct hierarchical lineage relationship among the three subclusters ( ) and an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified Wnt-β-catenin signaling as significantly down regulated in the cells of the Mature AB subcluster compared to both PreAB clusters (log10−3 adjusted P-value) ( ). Specifically, cells in the Mature AB cluster had higher expression of Cdh1 and Wnt inhibitor Dkk2, lower expression of Wnt target genes Ccnd1 and Jun and Wnt ligands Wnt6 and Wnt5b as compared to PreAB clusters. Of note, PreAB clusters expressed Wnt6, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt4 and Wnt target genes Lef1 and Zeb118,19 ( ). Zeb1 is a transcription factor that directly suppresses Cdh1gene activity20,21 and Zeb1 was nearly absent in the Mature AB cluster ( ). The dura cluster, a cell layer anatomically located immediately above the arachnoid barrier layer, were enriched for Wnt inhibitors Dkk2, Sfrp2, and Sfrp1 and Wnt receptors Fzd2 and Fzd1. These analyses of gene expression data suggested differentiation of arachnoid barrier cells from meningeal mesenchymal precursor cells requires decreased Wnt-β-catenin signaling.\n\nTo test the role of Wnt-β-catenin signaling in arachnoid barrier cell specification, we generated mouse mutants to constitutively elevate Wnt-β-catenin signaling in meningeal mesenchymal cells prior to arachnoid barrier cell specification. We crossed mice with Tbx18-CreERT2 allele, which we previously showed drives Cre expression in all meningeal mesenchymal cells to mice with a floxed β-catenin gain of function allele (Ctnnb1-ex3-flox22) that upon Cre recombination, generates a constitutive active version of β-catenin and a Cre reporter allele (Ai14-flox) that drives tdTomato expression ( ). When we exposed pregnant mice to tamoxifen at E11 and E12, a time point prior to arachnoid barrier cell specification16 and collected control tissue at E15 we observed E-cadherin+ arachnoid barrier cells were present in a continuous layer that covers the entire ventral to dorsal surfaces of the forebrain (Supp. Fig. 1A, B). Cre induced tdTomato expression in E-cadherin+ arachnoid barrier cells was ~90% expression in dorsal arachnoid barrier cells and ~50% expression in ventral arachnoid barrier cells (Supp. Fig. 1C), thus we were careful to make distinctions between these two areas in subsequent analysis.\n\nComparative analysis of the meninges in control and Tbx18-CreERT2; Ctnnb1-ex3-flox/+; Ai14 flox/+ embryos (referred to as meningeal β-catenin-GOF, abbreviated mβ-cat-GOF) showed that E-cadherin+, Claudin11+, and nuclear Klf5+ arachnoid barrier cells were nearly absent from the mβ-cat-GOF E15 and E17 dorsal forebrain meninges ( , , , and Supp. Fig. 2A, 2B), demonstrating substantial regional failure of arachnoid barrier cell development in mβ-cat-GOF mutants. mβ-cat-GOF mutants had increased expression of direct Wnt-β-catenin target Lef1 in tdTomato+ cells ( , ), confirming elevated Wnt signaling in recombined cells. Meningeal fibroblasts in the expression of other pia, arachnoid, and dura cell layer markers were not altered and neocortical neuron layering and cell number appeared normal in mβ-cat-GOF mutants (Supp. Fig. 1E, Supp. Fig. 2C–E). Electron microscopy (EM) on E17 meninges of control and mβ-cat-GOF mutants highlighted multiple abnormalities in the mutant, including prominent gaps between cells, absence of tight junctions, and increased collagen deposition between cells located where the arachnoid barrier layer would normally be present in the control ( , Supp. Fig. 1D). This supports that in mβ-cat-GOF mutants, cells retain mesenchymal features and failed to differentiate into epithelial-like cells. Consistent with mesenchymal characteristics, E15 mβ-cat-GOF mutants had significantly more tdTomato+ cells expressing Zeb1, a mesenchymal transcription factor and Wnt-β-catenin transcriptional target ( , ), most notably in the region where the arachnoid barrier cell layer (~6.5–10 μm above the brain surface) is observed in E15 control. Collectively these data point to a potential model of arachnoid barrier development where decreased Wnt-β-catenin signaling in meningeal mesenchymal cells, possibly due to reduced Wnt ligand expression and high Wnt inhibitors expression from the overlying dura, results in reduced Zeb1, increased E-cadherin expression, and acquisition of epithelial-like characteristics ( ).\n\nTo investigate functional properties of the fetal arachnoid barrier, we tested the CNS permeability of E17 control and mβ-cat-GOF mutants to a small molecular weight fluorescent tracer (Biocytin-TMR, 893 Daltons) ( ). Ten minutes after liver injection of Biocytin-TMR, we collected whole heads, sectioned, and visualized via microscopy. In controls, Biocytin-TMR signal was present in the dura, above the arachnoid barrier cell layer, but was excluded from the lower leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia) and brain below the intact arachnoid barrier ( – , , ). In contrast, in dorsal forebrain regions where mβ-cat-GOF mutants lack an arachnoid barrier layer, Biocytin-TMR signal was present in the lower leptomeninges and in the superficial brain region directly below the meninges ( – , , ). Biocytin-TMR signal was absent in the deeper subventricular zone away from the brain surface in control or mutant mice ( , , ), supporting that the BBB is not impaired in mβ-cat-GOF mutants. However since Tbx18-CreERT2 recombines mural cells (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) that are required for BBB integrity23,24, we analyzed Desmin+ mural cell in the meninges and the neocortex. Mural cell density associated with blood vessels in both regions were unaltered in mβ-cat-GOF mutants (Supp. Fig. 3A, B). Wnt-β-catenin signaling, a major pathway regulating BBB barrier properties, target Lef1 was highly expressed in control and mβ-cat-GOF leptomeninges and neocortex blood vasculature, but not in non-barrier dura vasculature (Supp. Fig 3C), showing additional evidence for an intact BBB properties in mβ-cat-GOF mutants. Collectively, the Biocytin-TMR analyses shows that the arachnoid barrier is functional by E17 and the lack of an arachnoid barrier in mβ-cat-GOF mutants permits access of peripheral molecules into the fetal leptomeninges and brain.\n\nWe next compared the ability of the bacterium, Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a pathogen that drives meningitis in neonates, to traverse into the leptomeninges following liver inoculation in control and mβ-cat-GOF mutants. We injected 106 Colony Forming Units (C.F.U.) of GFP-labeled GBS (~1 μm in diameter) bacteria into the livers of E17 animals and collected tissue 45 min later ( ). In control animals, the amount of GFP-GBS+ in the leptomeninges was sparse, consistent with a functional arachnoid barrier, but the GBS burden was significantly higher in the leptomeninges of mβ-cat-GOF mutants leptomeninges ( , ). This indicates that the lack of an arachnoid barrier in mβ-cat-GOF mutants permits increased access for GBS to enter the prenatal meninges. Increased access of the GFP+ GBS biological tracer could not be attributed to alterations in the number of meningeal macrophages as there were equal numbers of IBA1+ cells in the meninges of control and mβ-cat-GOF mutant mice at baseline and 45 minutes after injection of GBS ( , ). There were no major differences in GBS burden in skin (Supp. Fig. 3E) indicating that distribution of systemic GBS was not overtly altered between groups. We detected CD11b+, F4/80+ monocytes/macrophages and CD11b+, Ly6G+ neutrophils in blood and fetal livers of control and mβ-cat-GOF mutants (Supp. Fig. 3F, G) supporting there is no obvious impairments in the innate immune system that could potentially underlie observed differences in meningeal GBS of controls and mβ-cat-GOF mutants.\n\nTo investigate the maturation of the arachnoid barrier, we documented the temporal and spatial appearance of E-Cadherin/Claudin 11 co-expressing arachnoid barrier cells in the prenatal meninges and identified the earliest age when the arachnoid barrier can functionally restrict the passage of a small molecule treace. At E12, E-cadherin/Claudin 11 double positive arachnoid barrier cells are not detectable in the meninges ( , ). A few cells are expressing cytosolic Claudin 11 at E12 in/near the brain, but these cells did not co-express E-cadherin, indicative of another cell type ( , ). At E13 we observed consistent E-cadherin and Claudin 11 double-positive cells forming a layer in the ventral hindbrain with a patchy layer of a double-positive cells in the ventral forebrain, but very few double positive cells in the dorsal forebrain ( , ). At E14, E-cadherin/Claudin 11 double-positive cells were more numerous in the dorsal forebrain ( . ) but did not form a continuous layer in this region until E15 (Supp. Fig. 1A, B). Biocytin-TMR tracer and plate reader analysis showed that the superficial cortex of E15 brains had significantly more tracer signal than the superficial cortices from E17, postnatal, and adult animals ( ). This indicates that the E15 arachnoid barrier layer in the dorsal forebrain is ‘leaky”, despite the presence of a continuous E-cadherin/Claudin 11 double-positive cell layer. Analysis of tissue sections supported these findings showing that the amount of tracer below the arachnoid barrier in the leptomeninges was significantly higher at E15 compared to E16 and E17 meninges ( , ). These analyses demonstrate that the arachnoid barrier cellular layer starts to form around the brain at E13 and is continuous by E15, and that functional restriction to small molecular weight tracers does not occur until slightly later.\n\nWe next analyzed localization of tight and adherens junction proteins between arachnoid barrier cells in pre-, postnatal and adult mice, as barrier integrity critically depends on cell-cell junctions. Consistent with previous electron microscopy and freeze fracture studies3,13, adult cerebral leptomeninges whole mounts show arachnoid barrier cells are connected by tight and adherens junctions marked by co-localization of E-cadherin, Claudin 11, and ZO-1 proteins in high expression areas between cells (Supp. Fig. 4A), a pattern that matches freeze fracture studies describing tight junction strands in the arachnoid barrier layer of rodents13,14. To identify when junctions appear between arachnoid barrier cells and how junctional protein localization change with age, we immunolabeled cerebral leptomeninges wholemounts and measured junctional protein localization (junctional vs. non-junctional) and junctional density at E15, E17, P4, P7 and adults25,26 ( , , - ). At E15, when the arachnoid barrier layer does not restrict small molecule tracers, Claudin 11 protein expression was diffuse and mostly non-junctional ( ) with fewer Claudin 11+ junctions compared to E-cadherin junctions ( , ). E15 E-cadherin junctions, though more abundant than Claudin 11 junctions, had lower junctional fluorescence intensity compared to later time points ( , , , , and ). At E17, the number of Claudin 11+ and E-cadherin+ junctions had increased and were at equal numbers ( – ). EM of E15 and E17 meninges showed that although the overall layering and cellular composition of the meninges between the two timepoints was similar, including similar organization of arachnoid barrier cell processes, many more electron dense tight junctions were present at E17 as compared to E15 ( – , Supp. Fig. 4B). We also observed from pre- to postnatal time points, there was a decrease in non-junctional expression of Claudin 11 ( , ) and to a lesser extent non-junctional E-cadherin ( , ). Finally, arachnoid barrier cells are connected by junctions on multiple sides, creating domains ( ). We observe that arachnoid barrier domain area increased from E17 to P7 and adult time points ( , , and ). Arachnoid barrier cell proliferation measured by EdU pulse-labeling was initially high at E17, decreased between P4 and P7 and is absent in the adult (Supp. Fig. 4C, D), indicative of a concomitant decrease in proliferation as domain size increases during brain growth. This analysis shows that the arachnoid barrier maturation continues into postnatal ages and its ability to act as a selective barrier coincides with the increased junctional expression of Claudin 11 and E-Cadherin, along with increased density of tight junctions at E17.\n\nTaken together, a model of arachnoid barrier layer development emerges from our data. First, the arachnoid barrier cell layer arises from meningeal mesenchymal precursors in a temporally and spatially restricted manner from E13 to E15 through a mechanism involving downregulation of Wnt-β-catenin. In the cerebral leptomeninges, E-cadherin forms adherens junctions between arachnoid barrier cells by E15, followed by junctional Claudin 11 and a functional barrier by E17. To accommodate brain surface area growth from prenatal to adult stages, the arachnoid barrier cells proliferate in pre- and early postnatal stages, but later arachnoid barrier domain areas increase to expand the arachnoid barrier layer while maintaining a functional barrier ( ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe importance of arachnoid barrier in adult B-CSFB function is supported by several structural and tracer studies2,3,13,14 and recent work showing meningeal barrier leakage caused by absence of a meningeal T cell subtype resulting in microglia activation and cognitive deficits27. Far less is known about when arachnoid barrier cells specify and when it forms functional layer. This study provides fundamental insights into arachnoid barrier formation, describing arachnoid barrier cells from their first emergence at E13, to their expression of tight junctions and barrier properties by E17, through their postnatal maturation as and expansion around the growing mouse brain. This process of arachnoid barrier maturation resembles prenatal emergence and postnatal maturation of the BBB, with key differences. The arachnoid barrier becomes functional just after the BBB which is restrictive to tracers by E13-E14, depending on brain region28. Arachnoid barrier cells are also specified de novo from meningeal mesenchymal cells, dependent on downregulation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling. This downregulation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling is in contrast to BBB vasculature which grows into the CNS via angiogenesis of existing vasculature surrounding the CNS and acquires barrier properties via upregulation of Wnt−β-catenin signaling, induced by locally produced Wnt ligands. Future work will expand upon the current approaches detailed here to determine if there is a gradual spatial-temporal “tightening” that 28–30, or if it is an “all-or-none” phenomenon. These experiments, in conjunction with immuno-gold labeling with electron microscopy and super-resolution imaging of Claudin 11 and E-cadherin, will be important to better define specific junction protein localization and functions at subcellular resolution.\n\nOur work here shows that the arachnoid barrier can prevent the passage of peripherally injected dyes or bacteria in the fetal CNS as early as E17, which suggests a potentially important protective function for the prenatal arachnoid barrier. Our work also shows that arachnoid barrier continues to mature throughout postnatal life, a time when it must also expand in size to match brain and skull growth. We also show that this postnatal expansion is facilitated by an increase in the junctional domain size, a mechanism potentially conducive to the maintenance of an already established barrier. The arachnoid barrier postnatal maturation is also interesting in the context of meningitis as neonates are uniquely susceptible to GBS induced bacterial meningitis31–33. Our findings suggest that the still maturing postnatal arachnoid barrier could contribute to this neonatal vulnerability. In support of this idea, recent work showed that the neonatal choroid plexus has increased permeability to bacterial crossing, due to immature cell-cell junctions, and this contributes to neonatal susceptibility in bacterial meningitis34.\n\nOur work here also provides several new tools that can be used to investigate CNS barrier development. These include our prenatal model of defective arachnoid barrier development, whole mounts to visualize arachnoid barrier layer junctional organization, and functional assays that may aid in studies to address outstanding questions about the arachnoid barrier. There remains much unknown on the basic biology of the arachnoid barrier, such as: how does Wnt-β-catenin signaling suppression support arachnoid barrier cell specification and how are E-cadherin and Claudin 11 localized to cell-cell junctions in newly specified arachnoid barrier cells to form a functional structure? Disease relevant questions include how the immature or mature arachnoid barrier responds to acute physical injury vs. infectious agents vs. chronic disease, and if the arachnoid barrier can reactivate developmental programs to allow for regeneration.\n\nLimitations of the Study\n\nThis study is focused primarily on prenatal barrier function due to the early postnatal lethality of mβ-cat-GOF mutants. Given that there is extensive postnatal maturation of the meninges to acquire new functional properties, including diversification and maturation of meningeal immune populations35, development and function of dural lymphatics36–38, and the emergence of glymphatic flow39, there are numerous future directions to explore as we continue to investigate the potential contributions of the arachnoid barrier to CNS health and diseases, particularly in meningitis. In this study, our analysis of GBS infection only serves as a ‘biological tracer’, not an investigation of meningitis pathogenesis. Thus, future studies looking at CNS and meningeal inflammatory responses, long-term implications, and mechanisms of GBS infiltration in postnatal and adult animals, including those with arachnoid barrier impairment, will be critical for identifying the functional role(s) and response(s) of the arachnoid barrier during meningitis and will pave the road to further understanding how the arachnoid barrier may participate in a variety of diseases."
