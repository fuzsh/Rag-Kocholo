        "text": "10 weeks ago today, I broke my leg in spectacular fashion while riding my e-bike back to Newlab after a successful investor presentation. Sometimes, you can be so grateful that something didn't turn out worse than it did, that you overlook how bad the situation ACTUALLY is. To say I broke my leg is a massive oversimplification because, as the surgeon told me, my leg is REALLY messed up. The accident caused a bi-lateral fracture (on both sides) of my fibula, and, all the tendons and ligaments tore away which resulted in emergency surgery that has given me some new hardware - 5 screws and a plate to put my leg back together. I had to live on my couch for a month until my college bound daughter's (downstairs) bed became available. On top of that, I can't drive for at LEAST six more weeks. Thankfully, this has made our team show up more enthusiastic than ever to build and grow a platform that is reimagining what convenience and trasnparency in school bus transportation looks like. This injury has allowed me to see mobility and access in an entirely different way which is absolutely going to help to improve TripSlip and its offerings. I am continually grateful for everyone who has shown up for me and my daughters during all this - there are entirely too many to @, name or mention but they know who they are. ü•≤ I am grateful for the encouraging words, inquiries and offers to help. All I ask for is grace as I continue to ease myself into a rhythm and work flow that's akin to what existed before this accident. üôèüèΩ We've got a LOT cooking as we approach our official reveal of the new and improved TripSlip platform in time for back to school so please stay tuned. üöç"
