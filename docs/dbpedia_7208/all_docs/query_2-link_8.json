Oh! more than enough Is the work challenging? It is fabulous. Are you depressed or something? No way. Then why are you always lost in üí≠? For that question your answer is a little silence. After a deep breath you say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, I have everything in the checklist but something is missing. It feels like depression but it is not. I want to do so much but I am unable to. I keep giving reasons to myself. When days and months pass, I feel like shit. I don‚Äôt know if my therapist can even understand what I am going through. Chalo, let‚Äôs go for a coffee and that conversation just stops. I have heard multiple conversations on this genre from my inner circle. I went through it multiple times till I found the answer. I call this disease as ‚ÄúCREATIVE DEPRESSION‚Äù. It is not clinical depression. Creative depression is a certain void inside you. Sometimes it feels like a mid-life or quarter life crisis but it is not. Creative depression (my way of calling it) comes to us because we do not find enough opportunities to express ourselves. The myth is creativity is for creative people. Creativity is for every human being. To imagine and create is everyone‚Äôs birth right. Make time to build things, express your thoughts, write, speak, sing/dance and all of it for yourself. Do not attach a dollar value to it. If it comes as a side effect, awesomeness but don‚Äôt do it for money as a main effect. You will not heal yourself in that case. Draw things on Figma. If you are a pen-paper paper go for it in analog. Make a video. Create a garden. Learn visual thinking. Write stories. Go for hikes and runs (not for health reasons but just to be with nature). When you find a way to imagine and create everyday something magical happens inside you. The self care you give to yourself heals it inside you. It is very interesting that even therapist don‚Äôt talk about this aspect. I see 80% of us suffer creative depression than clinical depression. Two important books that helped me heal from creative depression are Heart talk - Cleo Wade and The Artist Way - Julia Cameron. Self care goes a long way. DM me if this speaks to you. I made some tools and tactics for myself and happy to share. #selfcare"
