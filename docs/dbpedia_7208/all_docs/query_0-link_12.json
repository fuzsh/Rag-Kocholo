        "text": "Julia Marcell\n\nBerlin\n\nâA voice that summons, drives and opens all the doors.â (Haldern Pop) Undeniably talented Berlin-based singer and songwriter Julia Marcell emerged back in 2007 with an EP Storm. Wide international recognition and support enabled her to raise public funds for the full-length album It Might Like You which was recorded in 2009 and produced by Moses Schneider. In 2011 she released an album titled June that marked a significant change in experimental rhythm-sound and gained her prestigious awards in Poland: Polish Music Academyâs Fryderyk 2012 (Best Alternative Album) and Politykaâs Passport (Best Popular Music Act). Julia and the band frequently tour around the world since 2007. The highlights of her extensive gig-list include South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in Austin, Haldern Pop Festival, Eurosonic Festival, Heineken Openâer in Gdynia, Dojima River Forum in Osaka, Lido in Berlin and other venues around the world.\n\nJulia Marcellâs tracks\n\nOndine (Jolene cover) by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2021-02-25T17:35:13Z\n\nUnderstand Me by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:54:34Z\n\nLife is on Television by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:53:57Z\n\nCerebral Bliss by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:53:34Z\n\nSkull Echo by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:53:33Z\n\nWhich Way is Now by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:52:38Z\n\nMother by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:52:37Z\n\nTime by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:51:37Z\n\nHouses of Glass by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:51:13Z\n\nNostalgic by Julia Marcell\n\npublished on 2020-01-28T16:52:19Z"
