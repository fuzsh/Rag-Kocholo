        "text": "The first time I saw Al Pacino on the stage was in the summer of 1977 when he appeared on Broadway in “The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel.” I had a great seat on the front row, and since then, the actor I got to know and appreciate tremendously in his films up until then, “Me, Natalie” (1969), “The Panic in Needle Park” (1971), “The Godfather” (1972), “Scarecrow” (1973), “Serpico” (1973), “The Godfather, Part II” (1974) and “Dog Day Afternoon” (1975)–earning him four consecutive Academy Award and four Golden Globe nominations–became a lifelong hero of mine.\n\nWhy? Because he was Michael Corleone, or Frank Serpico, or Lion in “Scarecrow” and Sonny in “Dog Day Afternoon.” His fresh, inspiring, and innovative acting style, which became his landmark from the very beginning, and the huge variety of in-depth characters he portrayed since his early years as a screen actor, turned him into an established screen star right away. Now, over four decades later, Mr. Pacino (b. 1940) still is one of the greatest, most talented, most versatile, and most iconic actors ever to grace the screen.\n\nSo when the American Cinematheque announced that a mid-week screening of the political drama “City Hall” (1996) at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica would be followed by a Q&A with Mr. Pacino and film director Harold Becker, I knew this would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to see him again on the stage, this time with Mr. Pacino at the center of panel interview, followed by a very enjoyable Q&A.\n\nMost questions were addressed to him, and that’s why I only focus here on his contribution to this event. Unfortunately, Mr. Becker’s audio was of poor quality. Considering the body of work of this highly acclaimed 90-year-old filmmaker, who also brought us the absorbing crime drama “The Onion Field” (1979) and prior to “City Hall” directed Mr. Pacino in “Sea of Love” (1989), that turned out to be a major disappointment.\n\nThis is a slightly edited and condensed version of the topics Mr. Pacino talked about.\n\nMr. Pacino, both you and Harold Becker were very successful on “Sea of Love” [1989]. Do you remember your initial conversations when you started to work on “City Hall”?\n\nWell, somebody else was in the room first. I’ve never forgiven you, Harold [laughs]. He was a great actor, very well-known. But for some reason, they fell out. But I love Harold, his direction, and I loved working with him and John Cusack; we had a good script. It’s a great feature film, but that’s Harold. Don’t forget he did “The Onion Field” [1979]! I haven’t seen “City Hall” for a long time—I’m gonna see it!—but I remember liking it, just as I liked “Sea of Love.” I really didn’t know how good it was and how good he directed it. It was much better than the way I remembered it; maybe it’s just age or something. Before we did the film, I talked to different mayors, like Ed Koch [mayor of New York from 1978-1989] and Rudy Giuliani [1994-2001]. You remember there’s a scene when they’re watching that carousel movie, and I’m outside in the lobby, hunched over like this—that’s Giuliani! It was great meeting those mayors and learning about New York.\n\n“City Hall” is one of the great New York movies made in the last thirty years. How difficult are the logistics when you’re shooting movies on this scale in the city? Is it all worth it, and what are the challenges?\n\nNew York gives you such an energy, it feeds you.\n\nEverybody in the movie is great, down to the smallest parts and the actors who have only one or two lines. That’s amazing, isn’t it?\n\nYou know, that reminds me of this actor who has hardly ever worked, he’s just depressed, and he goes to his agent, and this man says, ‘Listen, I got something for you.’ And the actor says, ‘Really??’ ‘It’s just one line, it’s a play, and it’s going on tonight.’ ‘So what’s the line?’ ‘You have to say, Is that a bomb right here?’ So the guy gets on the train, and he’s just practicing… Is that a bomb right here? Is that a bomb right here? And he’s doing it over and over again, but he’s really late for the show. So when he arrives there, they say, ‘Where the hell were you!’ ‘There was something on the train!’ And he puts his outfit on, saying, Is that a bomb right here, is that a bomb right here… When he’s backstage waiting, the stage manager and the actors say, ‘You go on, go!’ and he runs out, he hears this huge explosion, and he says, ‘What the f*ck was that!’ [Laughs].\n\nYou have a ton of lines in this movie, like the monologue at the funeral scene. How did you do that? Did you rehearse for that scene?\n\nWe had two versions, remember Harold? I thought, can I do what mayors do sometimes when there are in those situations when they revive—so I took that kind of preachy approach, and I remember when I was doing that, Harold just let me do it—that’s what I love about him. But to this day, I don’t know if the other version was better.\n\nI also like the final scene you had with John Cusack.\n\nIt was beautifully written and directed, with all the sadness and the tragedy.\n\nThis particular scene could be considered as a trademark of yours. How do you compare it to your work in films like “Dick Tracy” [1990] or “The Devil’s Advocate” [1997] ?\n\nIf you look at the film, there’s a reason why I was like that in the church scene, while in the final scene with John Cusack, there’s a different approach. I usually go by what the script is telling me. I know that sometimes risibility is appreciated; sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes I like it; sometimes I don’t. But if it calls for it, I do it. Usually, the variety is in the script.\n\nWho are your favorite directors you worked with, other than Harold Becker? Quentin Tarantino, Francis Ford Coppola,…\n\n…and Martin Scorsese! [“The Irishman,” now in post-production, is Mr. Pacino’s first Scorsese film.] I’ve been very lucky to have worked with those people, so it’s very hard to say anyone that’s my favorite. Of course, I started with Sidney Lumet [“Serpico,” 1973; “Dog Day Afternoon,” 1975], and he rehearsed, which was very important to get his group together. I also liked the way he directed. When we did the opening scene of “Dog Day Afternoon,” the bank robbery, he just said, ‘You go there, you go there, and you go there.’ He gave you things to do. When you started doing it—just by doing—you felt you were robbing a bank. You’re in it, because he directs that kind of vision. So I loved working in that way, but all those other directors, I love them. And Francis Ford Coppola made me famous; he was the only one who wanted me in “The Godfather” [1972], nobody else wanted me. They simply wanted to fire me.\n\nMany of the directors you have worked with have different styles, different approaches. What do you look for in a director? what helps you to deliver your best work?\n\nSometimes you don’t know what a director will bring out in you, but I completely trusted Harold. But you simply know that when you’re with those film directors, like Warren Beatty for example—I loved working with him—a lot of people don’t know I was in “Dick Tracy” [1990]. Those directors have this kind of sensibility, it’s infectious to you, no matter what you do, they will pick what has the kind of nutrition that is needed. So it’s very liberating when you work with these people. I just worked with Quentin Tarantino [“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”]: it’s very great to work with great directors. It also took “City Hall” fifteen weeks to shoot, but that’s what you see up there on the screen: you see fifteen weeks up there. So it’s difficult to make a movie in, let’s say, five weeks. Sometimes it works, but five weeks to make a movie… What am I talking about? [Laughs.] You know what it is? I’m thinking about certain movies and stuff, I don’t want to go into it because of names I’d have to say, so I think of them… I don’t know why I’m talking [laughs].\n\nWhat of your roles would you consider a favorite?\n\nWell, you have me there. It’s always very different; there are always so many components into what makes a role. You’re talking about films—it’s difficult to say, I know that “Scarface” [1983] is a very interesting film and has so many things in it that have lasted so long. I like that because at the time my life was pretty good. So that’s part of what made it interesting for me; I mean, you’re always going on. And “City Hall,” that film has a certain intelligence in it.\n\nWhat would your advice be to a less experienced director?\n\nGive the actor a really good script. As time goes on, it’s also good to think of the director first, but in the end, it’s the script—it’s the word. That’s how it works with me. I was offered “Star Wars” [1977] and turned it down because I didn’t understand it! I mean, at the time, it was innovative and groundbreaking, but I still didn’t understand what was going on. I gave it to a friend and a mentor of mine and I asked him, ‘Would you mind reading this thing? They offer me a lot of money, but I just don’t get it.’ So he read it, he called me back, and he said, ‘Oh Al, I don’t get it!’ [Laughs.]\n\nAnd what would you advise to young actors?\n\nIf acting is something that you really want to do, just keep doing it; whatever you can, however you can, do it. And if you can help yourself, don’t go for the part just to get work. Sometimes you do it and you get more work, I know. But it’s not about work, it’s about finding things in yourself that you really want and that you connect to with a role or something. I’ll give you an example. When I was young—like nineteen, twenty—I didn’t want to do any auditions, I didn’t want to go and see agents. I just rang the doorbells. ‘What have you done?’ And I said, ‘Absolutely nothing.’ I mean, what have I done? I got here, I’m in this office here, with you! So I got there, but I didn’t know what to say. But if you go and audition, and tell the joke, like, Is that a bomb right here—that’s the idea. So at auditions, sometimes they hand you this crap to read, you know, and what are you gonna do with it? Then I’d say, ‘Excuse, do you mind, I’ve prepared something for you…’ ‘You’ve prepared something?’ And then I’d burst into something by Eugene O’Neill or Shakespeare, and of course, they thought I was nuts and wouldn’t get the part. But I can tell you this; you make sure you don’t want the part—that’s the best advice, and you might get it.\n\nHow old were you when you decided you wanted to become an actor?\n\nI was very young. I was always acting in school, in high school—I was always nicknamed ‘the actor.’ I just kept going, not knowing why I was doing this. I was floundering with it, I was very troubled, did a lot of stuff, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do. And then finally I was in a play, some off-off-off-Broadway play, and I started saying the words—and something happened to me. I thought, ‘Yes, this is something I want to do now, because I can speak through this medium. That was it. And I didn’t know if I was good or bad or if I was talented. But once I knew I could do that, I didn’t care about anything, I didn’t care about money or getting paid, because I had that. Now, I don’t know how long that would have lasted, I was twenty-one years old. I felt I could speak, and that provoked me, that put the juice. So for me, it’s not about getting the part, it’s about having that opportunity to express.\n\nWhen will you be doing another play?\n\nI don’t know, right now I’m doing a series for Amazon called “The Hunt”—I’ve been doing that for a while, and if I survive it, I will come back, and once I get myself in some sort of frame, I might do another play somewhere. It’s hard to find, but you never know.\n\nIn “Bobby Deerfield” [1977], you did an imitation of Mae West. Would you like to do that again?\n\nYou know something? “Bobby Deerfield” was my favorite film, even though nobody liked it and it got terrible reviews. But something that I was going through in my life was coming out in the film. I was criticized for that Mae West scene because when I did it, they were saying, ‘Why is he really acting like Mae West?’ But I played a character having a hard time living, much less remembering anything, but the real emotion was if he could remember what it was like if he played Mae West. I was playing a character that couldn’t remember his past, and he couldn’t get through—he tried, he struggled, and the girl knew that. That was a very exceptional scene. I couldn’t do it now; I’m not there. But if you give me about six seconds… [laughs].\n\nSanta Monica, California\n\nMarch 27, 2019\n\nFILMS\n\nME, NATALIE (1969) DIR Fred Coe PROD Stanley Shapiro SCR A.
