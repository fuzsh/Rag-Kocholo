        "text": "The fastest men in the world were in action today, and we got to find out whether Noah Lyles could run as well as talk a good game in the men’s 100 metres. He could.\n\nBefore that, we had a host of other exciting events to get to, not least of which was the latest instalment of the rivalry between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThe two tennis superstars were playing for all the marbles today, as was China’s table tennis hero Fan Zhendong, who took on surprise Swedish finalist Truls Moregard. There was more gold on the line for China in the badminton men’s doubles, and the men’s golf finally came to a conclusion.\n\nWe have also kept an eye on Hong Kong cyclist Ceci Lee Sze-wing in the women’s road race in our live coverage of day nine in Paris.\n\nMore from our coverage:\n\nReporting by Mike Chan and Paul McNamara in Paris, and Josh Ball, Ira Gorawara, Meredith Chen, Sylvian Ma, Angeline Jiang, Lars Hamer, Andrew Richardson and Tom Bell in Hong Kong"
