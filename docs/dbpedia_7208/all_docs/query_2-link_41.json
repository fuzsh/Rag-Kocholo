        "text": "Dear Friends:\n\nWelcome to In the Heights! I first fell in love with this sweet, simple story of neighborhood and family when I was taken to see the Off-Broadway production by my friend and mentor Normand Kurtz, a brilliant Tony Award-winning producer.\n\nNormand, his wife Margie and daughter Susie were the best scouts imaginable, and they are responsible for many of the shows and artists you have seen at Rubicon over the years. (Normand passed away last year and this production is dedicated to his memory.)\n\nIn the Heights also remains my favorite of the more than 50 summer youth musicals produced at Rubicon. Closing night marked the first “graduation” from our program of several students who had been a part of the theatre since its inception, some since they were 5 years old. Many were going off to college or conservatory programs (some leaving the next day). Every time Jesse Graham as Usnavi sang or spoke the word “home” in the final song, I burst into tears. The talent and dedication of that cast gave me great hope for the future. And although our youth programs are more about teaching valuable life skills than developing future professionals, several members of that In the Heights cast are already taking the theatre world by storm.\n\nThis production of In the Heights is also very special because Luis Salgado said “yes” after a months-long courtship. He and Valeria Cossu and his international team from Salgado productions have a deep connection to the piece. (Luis was the Latin Dance consultant and performed in the Tony Award-winning Broadway production; and he helmed the first Spanish-language production which won 9 Helen Hayes awards in D.C.). From our first phone conversation, I knew he would create a unique new production for our community – not a cookie cutter version of what was (amazing ‘though it was), but one that would be fresh and original and true to this moment and this place.\n\nOur values were also aligned related to community. How could we do a show about community and not do everything we could to engage our own? Two team members (Bryan Ernesto Menjivar and Mariana Herrera Juri) came from New York and Colombia to run free summer dance and vocal workshops for local individuals (mostly Latine’) who had raw skills and passion or who were interested in rekindling their interest in musical theatre. More than 85 people participated and it was the joy of a lifetime to see their dedication and drive. Of those that decided to audition, three won their auditions, standing toe-to-toe with the remarkable professionals you see on stage: Ximena Valentina Alvear, Raegan Delgado and Dreamer Rae Wilson.\n\nThe conversations led to further brainstorming with Hannah-Beth Jackson, Sabrena Rodriguez (President of the Board of Ventura Unified School District), Assistant Superintendent Greg Bayless, and Oxnard High School arts champion Marcell Brickey. The result was groundbreaking new partnerships. In addition to three daytime student matinees at the theatre, our cast members went into area high schools sand middle schools for the first time in years, performing assemblies and conducting classroom workshops which reached more than 5,000 students during an intensive two-week pause in rehearsal.\n\n“This was probably the best assembly in my 9 years here. The individual impact this had on our students was powerful and personal. Representation matters and our students could see themselves and their stories in today’s performance and performers. The actors were engaging, funny, inspiring, and ‘real’ with students.” – Deidres Monares, Principal\n\n“I don’t even know what to do or say, I have never seen people who look like me on stage telling stories like mine.” – PCH Student\n\nI hope the impact of this production will be felt by our community for years to come. And I am overjoyed to be sharing this show with you in my final weeks as a staff member at Rubicon.\n\nAfter 25 years, for those that may now know, I retire as Producing Artistic Director of Rubicon Theatre Company on closing day of In the Heights. It’s been a long and beautiful run and my husband, Rubicon Co-Founder Jim O’Neil and I will forever be grateful to those we have met here in Ventura for teaching us the meaning of community and showing us what can happen when dedicated and passionate volunteers come together in pursuit of common goals. We are excited to be able to spend more time with our own “familia” and to begin a new chapter.\n\nWhat we are most excited about, however, is the opportunity to pass the torch to two longtime friends and collaborators, Beverly and Kirby Ward. They are incredibly talented veteran performers with West End, Broadway and National Tour credits. They first came to Rubicon for She Loves Me some year ago, with Kirby directing and Bev playing Ilona. They returned for Return to the Forbidden Planet and Jim’s production of King Lear. Four years ago, they joined the staff as Directors of Education and Outreach, and Bev has been driving the development and fundraising effort for the last couple of years. They have been an integral part of the team. Since joining the staff, they also created the gorgeous production of Big River which was presented not long before the pandemic.\n\nParting with people and places you love is always sweet sorrow, but we leave knowing that this is the right time to infuse new vitality and vision into the organization as Bev and Kirby move Rubicon from a founder-driven organization to a strong and sustainable institution.\n\nThere are many people to thank, among them our first angel Barbara Meister and our wise sage Jordan Laby; our bevy of soulful beauties at the beach – Mary Ann Cohen, Judith R. Nelson, Eileen Ogle and Marilyn Hilton; our partners in the art, especially Jenny Sullivan, Joseph Fuqua, Joe Spano, George Ball and Amanda McBroom, Stephanie Zimbalist, Linda Purl, Susan Clark, Chris Butler, Katharine Farmer, Lauren Patten and Michael Jackowitz; Christina and Jessie Vacchiano, Stephanie Coltrin, Sandy, Steve, Shelly, Greg, Sasha, Ellen, Seryozha, Katy, Vanessa, Barbara, Israel, Frank, David and Mike; our board presidents Claire, Paul, Bill, Claire, Roz, Richard, Diane, Claire and Doug; Honorary Chairs Rosa Lee and Al; board members Jeanne, Stephanie, Brad, and Kevin; volunteer chairs Dottie, Penny, Wendy and Lois; and dedicated volunteers Lane, Madeline, Kay x 2, Freddie and Walt; along with countless others.\n\nJim and I look forward to time together to more fully express our gratitude. Above all, we look forward to seeing what future “heights” will be attained by Bev and Kirby with your continued support.\n\nBlessings,"
