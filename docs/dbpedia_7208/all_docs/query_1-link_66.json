        "text": "Musician Of The Week\n\nJulia Marcell\n\nIf it comes to the inner circles of my favourite musicians, Julia is my freshest discovery. I had the amazing chance to stand 2 meters from this Polish girl during their live performance in Berlin during EM 2012. To watch her movements and facial expressions was almost such a strong artistic experience as listening to her magical voice while melting to the rhythm of their Björk-ish songs.\n\nFind out her upcoming concerts in Germany and Poland on their website and check out my tube playlist.\n\nOn my space you can find her fresh album June.\n\nArtist Of The Week\n\nLora Zombie\n\nI luckily got to observe the rise of a perfect DA artist to a real star exhibiting her works, making designs and publishing books. Over the years, I never got bored by this Russian who was my first contact to grunge art. Therefore, a place of featured artists belongs to her as well.\n\nCheck out her blog, like her and see photos of her (which are also very artistic) on facebook and browse my favourite works on deviantart.\n\nOnline Comic Of The Week\n\nHipster Hitler\n\nA lot of cliché anti-hipster and inappropriate Nazi humour. Short, simple and intellectual distraction from your work. Oh and, black and white. To the comic.\n\nThis animation introduced me to the comic:\n\nInteractive Site Of The Week\n\nMuseum of Endangered Sounds\n\nChildren of the second millennium! Be prepared for the ultimate nostalgia! And create your personal archaic dubstep song. To the museum.\n\nYoutube Channel Of The Week\n\n5secondfilms"
