        "text": "This year, a total of 17 Friends Academy musicians and vocalists were selected for the prestigious 2022-23 NYSSMA All County ensembles. The annual NYSSMA festival is held each spring and following their auditions, musicians are selected by New York State for All County based on their final NYSSMA scores and faculty recommendations. All County musicians and vocalists are then invited to perform at separate winter concerts with their fellow regional NYSMMA All County ensemble or orchestra.\n\nAll County is returning after a hiatus of two years, and this year, Friends Academy was thrilled to have the highest number of vocalists accepted. \"I am so proud of all of our student-musicians,\" shared Friends Academy Music Convenor Laura Backley, \"especially following the pandemic with all of the challenges that our students endured and overcame.\" \"It is an amazing achievement.\"\n\nCongratulations to the following Upper and Middle School students:\n\nUpper School\n\nVoice\n\nTheresa Yu, 11th â€“ Violin\n\nVoice\n\nInstrumental"
