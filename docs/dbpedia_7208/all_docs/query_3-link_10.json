        "text": "Presented by: One Little Indian Olsztyn POLAND\n\nMy name is Julia and I write songs - that’s what I do most of the time when I don’t sing. So out of these made up little tunes sometimes something worthwhile is born and these are what I call classical punk songs. Classical because of my intentions, punk because of the execution. Mostly they are stories - I write them simple to make sure everyone gets them, but still not too simple to make sure everyone gets them in a different way. These songs-stories are very different from each other, so to balance things out, I like to have modest instrumentation - natural, organic sounds of wood, string, finger hitting a piano key and voice whispering, cracking, breathing - this is the world of sounds that excites me.\n\nIn October 2007 a pretty large group of formerly unknown to me people helped me record my debut album by donating their own money. All thanks to Sellaband.com - a website known for notoriously helping people like me. So I traveled from Poland to Germany to create my debut \\\"It Might Like You\\\" with wonderful string quartet, four equally wonderful drummers and Moses Schneider who took over the production. I insisted that we record it live and leave all the room sounds, accidents and mistakes, which actually turned out to be beautiful kind of accidents and mistakes and only made the record better. Unpolished, fragile and very human. With all our love of music and raw energy captured on ones and zeros.\n\nNow, thanks to even more help from yet another group of formerly unknown to me people, the album can be found in stores in Poland (via Galapagos Music), Germany, Austria and Switzerland (via Rough Trade). And so me and my band are currently playing gigs mostly in Germany and Poland, but we also had a chance to perform in UK, Japan, Holland and Portugal."
