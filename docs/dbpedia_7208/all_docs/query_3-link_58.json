        "text": "Mikromusic is a Wrocław - based Polish group established in 2002 by vocalist Natalia Grosiak and guitarist David Korbaczyński, playing a mix of tripp hop and jazz.The two initially performed as a duo, with Natalia responsible for the songs and David for arrangements.\n\nThe band's formation can be tracked back to 2002 and the Student Song Festival in Kraków, where Grosiak and Korbaczyński successfully teamed up with other musicians to win two awards (not yet under the name Mikromusic) and went on to record a professional demo.\n\nThe lineup grew gradually and underwent several changes. The team invited Igo Blishke, from Germany, who played with them for a time. Further band's members became bassist Maciej Chudy, drummer and trumpeter Sebastian Szczepanowski, and Grzegorz Grocholski.\n\nAround that time they named themselves Mikromusic.After their success at the Student Song Festival, and a second place a year later, they were finalists in Warsaw and Opole OPPY debuts (with Ernest Hekselem on the trumpet).\n\nAt that time, Natalia and David also met Robert Szydło (who performed on their demo), an outstanding bass player and producer, and promised each other that one day they will record an album together.\n\nThey went on to do just that in 2006.Work on their debut album \"Mikromusic\" took years, and in the meantime the group has signed a publishing contract with Polish Radio. Polish Radio Program 3 (Trójka) extended patronage over the album, with renowned polish music journalist Marek Niedźwiedzki ushering them in.\n\nTheir next releases, \"Sennik\" (2008) and \"Sova\" (2010) came from different labels.Current lineup consists of Natalia Grosiak (vocal), Dawid Korbaczynski (guitar), Robert Szydło (bass), Robert Jarmuzek (piano), Adam Lepka (trumpet), Lukasz Sobolak (drums), Maciek Prokopowicz (sound engineer)"
