        "meta_description": "ESNS 2012 Line-up - Classical punk, that is how Julia Marcell describes her music. Classic because of the intentions and punk because of the execution. The Polish singer songwriter, currently residing in Berlin, has been writing her own songs since she was fourteen. A turning point was the moment she bought a piano. She had the intention to play classical music, however the outcome was that she started writing her own songs on the piano. Music that is loved by many, when she registered to Sellaband, where you can find sponsors to fund your album, she collected 50.000 euro within three months to record It Might Like You in 2008. And that is not the end, this year June was released. An album with more focus on rhythm. It has been said there is so much rhythm in her songs that you think you hear a beat even before one really sounds.",
