        "text": "Today’s Band of the Day is actually Solo Artist of the Day…\n\nSimple things first – where are you from?\n\nLeesburg, GA. About 3 hours south of Atlanta.\n\nHow did you start out?\n\nI’ve played in many bands before and I just got tired of things not working out and having to rely on other people for my success. I finally decided to go solo because now, I only have to rely on myself. I’ve been solo for about a year now and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made musically.\n\nHow long have you been a solo artist?\n\nI’ve been performing as a solo artist for about a year now.\n\nBefore you get sick of being asked… where does your stage name come from?\n\nJames is actually my first name and Russell is my middle. I wanted to use Russell James to separate my personal life from my artistry.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nThis one definitely gets me thinking. I’ve had so many influences from so many talented artists/bands from completely different genres that it makes it hard to really narrow it down. I can say as of right now my biggest influence are probably Maroon 5, Twenty One Pilots, Logic, NF, Rag n’ Bone Man, and Taylor Swift.\n\nDescribe your music. What makes you unique?\n\nCatchy melodies and relatable lyrical content. I believe those are the driving force behind my music.\n\nDo you have any particular lyrical themes?\n\nI draw inspiration from real life situations and experiences whether it be personally or a friend/family member. I feel like my lyrics are very relatable to many people just because they’re very real, raw, and emotional.\n\nWhat’s your live show like? How many shows have you played?\n\nRaw, energetic, genuine, positive vibes. I’ve been playing since I was 15 so there’s no way I could remember all the shows I’ve played.\n\nWhat’s the wildest thing you’ve seen or done at a live show?\n\nI used to play drums in a band. The frontman never wore underwear and also he wore really tight pants. On not one, but two occasions he ripped the back of his pants and was exposed. He had to finish out the set like that. It was pretty hilarious.\n\nWhat equipment do you use?\n\nFor my acoustic performances I’m using my Martin guitars. For all other performances I’m using my Shure SM58 mic along with my Shure wireless in ear monitor system. Everything else is just backing tracks.\n\nWhat are your plans for 2019?\n\nI’m currently working on releasing an EP this year and also releasing multiple music videos to support the release as well. I’ve recently released my single “Comedown” along with a music video. The video is available on Facebook and YouTube while the song is available on all major streaming services.\n\nIf you were second on a three-band bill, which band would you love to be supporting and which band would you choose to open for you? A chance to plug someone you’ve toured with, or a mate’s band we’ve not heard of before!\n\nI would love to be a supporting act for Maroon 5. I really dig their music and Adam is a phenomenal singer. I’m also really good friends with the guys in the American rock band Days To Come. It’d be really cool to have them open up for me sometime.\n\nRussel James: facebook | youtube | spotify"
