        "text": "The History of Mosaic as Written by Dr. John Doucet in the Mosaic 2007 Issue\n\n“First, the true history of Mosaic begins in 1949, with a side-stapled, mimeographed publication on letter-sized paper called Pencil Tracks. Some regard Pencil Tracks as the “predecessor” of Mosaic. But careful reading of the Foreword to Mosaic 1966 reveals that the two titles refer to one official student literary magazine and the same, as the student leadership decided simply to change the name. The name “Pencil Tracks” was used though 1964 for 14 editions, and the name “Mosaic” was used for the first time with the 1966 edition and until 1968-69 edition. After a decade’s absence, Mosaic re-emerged in 1979. […] Second, the emergence of a student literary magazine at Nicholls in 1949 makes Mosaic one of the oldest college student literary magazines in the state, second on to The Delta (later named Manchac and still later named The Delta again) of LSU-Baton Rouge. That magazine began publication only two years earlier but nearly a century after the doors of its institution had opened to students. Given that Nicholls only opened its doors in 1948, student literary publication is much more an integral tradition here than at any other college or university in Louisiana. […] Third, Nicholls students in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s didn’t simply establish the new series of Mosaic as their legacy. Literary magazines at other state universities depend upon grants, royalties, and donations and as a result of this uncertain funding, go into and out of publication. In 1981, Nicholls students were prescient enough to self-assess financial support of their magazine and thereby secure its continuity.”"
