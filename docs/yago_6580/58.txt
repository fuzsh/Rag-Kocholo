"Lilyan Tashman was a husky-voiced vaudeville, Broadway, and film actress, best known for her supporting roles as the bitchy other woman.She married openly gay actor Edmund Lowe in 1925, but her lesbian affairs were not a secret.'When Lilyan had some drinks, it was best not to go in the powder room with her,' said Irene Mayer Selznick, daughter of Louis B. and wife David O. 'I did once and was never so startled in my life. I'd known Lil from way back, but nothing like that had ever happened to me in my life. So overt. I'd never seen anything like it â€” couldn't believe it was happening. Didn't know it ever happened.'Actress Lina Basquette is also on record as being cornered in a ladies' room by Tashman.Columnist Jimmy Starr said Tashman seduced actress Estelle Taylor, the vampy star who'd played Lucrezia Borgia in Don Juan. 'Ever since she was a girl,' Silver Screen told its readers, "Tash" has been lugging the "different" label, but has never been bothered by it.'"
