        "text": "EDMUND LOWE\n\nDashing sepia image in fedora, with his jacket collar pulled up\n\nPhotograph inscribed and signed: \"For -/Lily/with best wishes/Edmund Lowe.\" Sepia, 8x10. American actor EdmundLowe (1890-1971) worked as a teacher before joining a stock company in Los Angeles, California. He debuted on the silver screen in 1915's The Wild Olive, the first of over 120 film appearances, and made his Broadway debut in 1917's The Brat, the first of his 12 plays on the Great White Way. He became a popular leading man in elegant roles, but made a name for himself as the hell raising Sergeant Quirt in the 1927 film version of What Price Glory? This movie led to several sequels with Lowe and Victor McLaglen as Quirt's rival Flagg, with their signature taglines \"Sez you? Sez me!\" Lowe made his break into television in 1949; he's probably best known in this medium for his role as David Chase in Front Page Detective (1951). Lowe, who was gay, had a marriage of convenience with lesbian actress Lilyan Tashman from 1925 until her early death in 1934. Edges toned. Corners lightly worn. Fine condition.\n\nThis website image may contain our company watermark.
