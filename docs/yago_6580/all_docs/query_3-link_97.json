        "text": "Welcome to a new Film Friday and the continuation of our spotlight series on the Pre-Code work of the unjustly under-praised Kay Francis (1905-1968), one of the most popular Warner Brothers stars of the 1930s. Known today as “Kay Fwancis” for her distinguished speech impediment, I am of the opinion that Kay Francis is nevertheless one of the decade’s most natural and captivating leading ladies. We covered one of her little known Post-Code films, The Goose And The Gander (1935), in our series on 1935, but the only Pre-Code picture of hers that we’ve featured is the divine Trouble In Paradise (1932), which is among my favorite films. There are 11 more Pre-Code Francis pictures that I want to cover here. So far we’ve covered Guilty Hands (1931) and 24 Hours (1931). Today…\n\nGirls About Town (1931)\n\nEscorts and sugar daddies rejoice! Girls About Town is essentially about two hookers. (It is based on a Zoe Akins story, after all.) One falls in love and decides to “go straight” while the other schemes to get an emerald ring. It’s classic Pre-Code; from the set-up to the delicious one-liners (several of which even shocked me during my first viewing), this is a picture that could only have been made during this era. And in many ways, it’s the perfect Pre-Code. In addition to some really sharp comedy, we have a story about modern realistic people behaving in shockingly truthful ways. Beyond that, it’s just a joyful film to watch. Although imbued with many genuinely dramatic moments, the film never goes heavier than it needs to. Fast-paced and unpredictable, there’s no time to sit and think about flaws. And that’s exactly what a good film should do to its audience.\n\nWe can also attribute to the picture’s success to its strong casting. Our spotlighted leading lady extends her reputation for sincerity, giving a multi-layered performance that allows the audience to both accept her in the role and believe the choices that she makes throughout. She’s always a breath of fresh air, a more glamorous example of the everywoman: fun, smart, honest. Those adjectives also apply to Lilyan Tashman’s character, who ably takes on the more comedic elements of the story. And as is often the case in these primitive ‘buddy films,’ (and I consider Girls About Town to be one) the funny friend usually walks away with the picture. She’s marvelous, and it’s a shame her early death (in 1934) cut off what could have been a very interesting career.\n\nI can’t say enough good things about this film. I was entertained for all 79-minutes — from the nifty opening credits to the happy ending where Kay gets her man and Lilyan gets her emerald. Great cast, great script, great fun. Check this one out; it’s highly recommended to all Pre-Code lovers!\n\nCome back next Friday for another Francis Pre-Code! And tune in on Monday for the start of a whole new week of fun on That’s Entertainment!"
