        "text": "Actor Born March 3, 1890 in San Jose, CA\n\nVeteran actor Edmund Lowe could play a suave playboy in one move and a tough marine sergeant in the next.\n\nMost of Lowe's more than 100 movie roles were as the \"perfect bachelor,\" with dinner jacket, slicked-down hair and debonair mustache.\n\nBut he is probably best remembered by moviegoers as 1st Sgt. Quirt of a series of movies about the marines made in the 1920s and 1930s. The late Victor McLaglen played opposite him in these films as Capt. Flagg.\n\nThese \"sez you-sez me\" movies included \"What Price Glory,\" \"The Cockeyed World,\" \"Women of All Nations,\" \"Hot Pepper\" and \"Call Out the Marines.\"\n\nLowe also starred in such movies as \"Dinner at Eight,\" \"Ports of Call,\" \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,\" \"Transatlantic,\" \"Good Intentions,\" \"Born Reckless\" and \"Dress to Kill.\"\n\nLowe's last movie, \"Heller in Pink Tights,\" starred Sophia Loren and Anthony Quinn."
