        "text": "With the explosion of car ownership in the 1920s and 30s came improved highways across America, but if one were to undertake a long-distance journey, like The New Yorker’s Morris Markey, you were bound to find a wide range of conditions, from concrete highways to muddy dirt roads.\n\nMarkey wrote about his experience of driving from New York City to Atlanta for his “Reporter at Large” column, noting that stops at filling stations also offered opportunities to fill up on bootleg gin. Drunk driving, it seems, wasn’t a big concern in the early 1930s.\n\nUnfortunately, Markey shared the sensibilities of many of his fellow Americans 89 years ago, and made this observation about drivers below the Mason and Dixon Line:\n\n* * *\n\nPale Riders\n\nSince the mid-19th century Chelsea’s Tenth Avenue was known as “Death Avenue” due to the killing and maiming of hundreds who got in the way of freight trains that plowed through 10th and 11th Avenues in the service of warehouses and factories in the district. In the 1850s the freight line hired horsemen known as “West Side Cowboys” to warn wagons and pedestrians of oncoming trains, but even with this precaution nearly 450 people were killed by trains between 1852 and 1908, with almost 200 deaths occurring in the decade preceding 1908. Calls for an elevated railroad were finally answered with the opening of the High Line in 1934. “The Talk of the Town” looked in on the last of these urban cowboys:\n\n* * *\n\nGuys and Dolls\n\n“The Talk of the Town” had some fun with a little-known aspect of a notorious gangster’s life; namely, the doll-filled house belonging to Jack “Legs” Diamond:\n\n“Talk” also made joking reference to the number of times Diamond had been shot and survived to tell about it.\n\n* * *\n\nIf Looks Could Kill\n\nThe New Yorker’s film critic John Mosher had a difficult time making sense of Murder by the Clock and its lead actress, Lilyan Tashman, who gave a tongue-in-cheek performance as the film’s femme fatale.\n\n* * *\n\nEine Kleine Nachtmusik\n\nOpen-air performances of classical music and opera were popular summertime diversions in the days before air-conditioning. In 1931 crowds gathered in Lewisohn Stadium to hear the New York Philharmonic perform under the direction of Willem van Hoogstraten, who conducted the Lewisohn summer concert series from 1922 to 1939. Here is a listing in The New Yorker’s “Goings On About Town” section:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nFlo Ziegfeld’s 1931 Follies were lavish productions, but his advertising in The New Yorker was anything but as evidenced in this tiny ad that appeared at the bottom of page 52…\n\n…no doubt anticipating the demise of Prohibition, the makers of Anheuser-Busch beverages ramped up the promotion of their non-alcoholic products to create associations with pre-Prohibition times…\n\n…not to be outdone by the East Coast chocolates giant Schrafft’s, Whitman’s took out this full page ad to suggest how you might enjoy their product…\n\n…which was in sharp contrast to the approach Schrafft’s took in this full-page ad featured in the April 25, 1931 New Yorker, which touted the health benefits of its candy…\n\n…on to our cartoons, Richard Decker took us swimming with a middle-aged man who was anything but bored…\n\n…Barbara Shermund went en plein air with a couple of her ditzy debs…\n\n…Garrett Price also went to the country to find a bit of humor…\n\n…Helen Hokinson found a home away from home for a couple looking to take the sea air…\n\n…James Thurber continued to explore his brewing war between the sexes…\n\n…Harry Haenigsen gave us a novel approach to landing a trophy fish…\n\n…William Steig illustrated the wonders of the tailoring profession…\n\n…and Alan Dunn aptly summed up the generation gap of the 1930s…\n\n…on to the Aug. 1, 1931 issue…\n\n…”The Talk of the Town” mused about the advertising jingles made famous by the makers of Sapolio soap…\n\n…Bret Harte actually did write jingles for the brand, once described by Time magazine as “probably the world’s best-advertised product” in its heyday. With a huge market share, Sapolio was so well known in the early 20th century that its owners decided they no longer needed to spend money on advertising. It was a poor decision, and by 1940 the product disappeared from the marketplace.\n\n* * *\n\nTough Love\n\nAs a charter member of the famed Algonquin Round Table, Heywood Broun was a friend to many of the founding writers and editors of The New Yorker. And so it must have been quite a task to review his play, Shoot the Works, which The New Yorker found wanting in a number of aspects. And because he was so close to Broun himself, Robert Benchley left the review writing to someone who signed the column “S. Finny.” I can’t find any record of an S. Finny at The New Yorker, and I don’t believe this is a Benchley pseudonym (he used “Guy Fawkes” in The New Yorker). At any rate, here is an excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe makers of the “Flexo” ice cube tray continued to tout the wonders of their product with these Ripley-themed ads. This might appear rather mundane to modern eyes, but electric refrigerators with built-in freezers were still rather novel in 1931…\n\n…another way to stay cool in the summer of 1931 was to take an excursion to the Northern climes…\n\n…this ad for the New York American featured an illustration by Herbert Roese, whose early work strongly resembled that of Peter Arno’s…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we have the latest antics of the Little King courtesy Otto Soglow…\n\n…William Steig added levity to a heavy moment…\n\n…Barbara Shermund found humor at an antiques shop…\n\n...John Held Jr continued his revels into our “naughty” Victorian past…\n\n…and we end with Garrett Price, and a look at the ways of the modern family…"
