        "text": "This picture is a pleasant little thing for a Summer audience out for a few hours vacation from the solemnity of life. It is not among the ten best of the year, to be sure, but it likely doesn't aim quite so high as that. The acting on the whole is good and the situations are carried out amiably. Occasionally the theme lapses into slapstick and at others the big rainstorm and drama expert has been called in with almost dire results.Babe Stewart, our leading man, finds himself in the early thirties as a gambler. He has a girl named Kay, and an apartment to which the young lady lures elderly males out for a good time. Kay and the esteemed Babe quarrel, however, and the former—in the language of the force—turns in her partner. He heads for the great open spaces and in a small town meets Mary Randall, a high school student.Presently they are married, and the indictment against Babe having been tossed aside, the couple go to New York. The gambler gives up his trade and goes to work, his wife stays home and answers the door bell. But Kay does not forgive, and, in fact, goes to the District Attorney with the information that Babe is back in town. The law dusts off the indictment and sends the reformed gentleman up the river. He does not tell his wife, leading her to think that he is merely on a business trip to Buenos Aires.Some time later Mary discovers that her husband is in jail and sets out to see him, meeting the wretched Kay at the prison gates. She then returns home through a rainstorm, weeping, to conceal the disaster from her parents. Babe presently gets a pardon and comes back from \"Buenos Aires,\" confesses and then is forgiven, because Mary all this time has been knitting minute and spectral clothes.Except for one or two spots the play is well done, having a happy-go-lucky manner at times quite charming. Incidents of apartment life—the ice man and the \"college guy\" selling magazine subscriptions—are worked in with ability. Mr. Lowe, as Babe, carries of his part well with the manner of Mr. Menjou and Miss Moore, as Mary, gives a good interpretation of the high school student in a small town turned wife in New York.\n\nColleen Moore the Heroine of a New Film at Mark Strand.HAPPINESS AHEAD, with Colleen Moore, Edmund Lowe, Lilyan Tashman, Edythe Chapman and Charles Sellon; news reel, Movietone News and Vitaphone presentation of Florence Moore in songs and Hobart Bosworth in the sketch, \"A Man of Peace.\" At the Mark Strand."
