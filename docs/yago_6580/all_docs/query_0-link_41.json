        "text": "\"Lilyan Tashman was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 23, 1896. She was the youngest of ten children and started modeling when she was a teenager. Her acting career began in vaudeville and she appeared in The Ziegfeld Follies. At the age of eighteen she married stage actor Al Lee. The marriage lasted seven years. Lilyan started getting cast in silent films liked Head Over Heels and Manhandled. She usually played supporting roles and found herself typecast as a villain. Lilyan was a lesbian and her numerous affairs with women became notorious. She fell madly in love with actress Greta Garbo who broke her heart. In 1925 Lilyan appeared in ten films including Pretty Ladies and Bright Lights. That same year she decided to marry her best friend, actor Edmund Lowe, who was also gay. The couple lived in a mansion called \"Lilowe\" where they threw the wildest Hollywood parties. Lilyan's love of clothes and her lavish wardrobe earned her the title of 'the best dressed woman on the screen.'\""
