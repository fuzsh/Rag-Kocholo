        "text": "Top stars:\n\nAccording to Photoplay magazine\n\nLon Chaney\n\nClara Bow\n\nTop grossing films:\n\nAccording to Variety\n\n1. GOLD DIGGERS OF BROADWAY..WB..$5.2 million\n\n2. SUNNY SIDE UP..FOX..$3.2 million\n\n3. THE COCK-EYED WORLD..FOX..$2.7 million\n\n4. WELCOME DANGER..PAR..$2.1 million\n\n5. THE DESERT SONG..WB..$2 million\n\n6. RIO RITA..RKO..$1.9 million\n\n7. THE COCOANUTS..PAR..$1.8 million\n\n8. IN OLD ARIZONA..FOX..$1.5 million\n\n9. THE LOVE PARADE..PAR..$1.5 million\n\n10. WHY BRING THAT UP?..PAR..$1.4 million\n\nTop events of 1929:\n\nJanuary\n\nAs the year begins, there are now 9,000 theatres fitted with sound. By 1931, there will be 13,000 sound cinemas in the U.S.\n\nFox releases the first major motion picture filmed outdoors. IN OLD ARIZONA, starring Edmund Lowe and Warner Baxter, hits screens on January 20th.\n\nBut the use of sound on location is still difficult for movie makers. As a result, the technique of ‘synthetic sound’ is being used by directors like Rouben Mamoulian to create moods, instead of accurate location recording.\n\nFebruary\n\nThere are 110 million movie tickets being sold every week.\n\nOn the 1st, MGM releases its first major musical film of the sound era, THE BROADWAY MELODY. It will inspire copycat productions at other studios, and spawn a series of sequels at MGM that will run into the early 1940s. The film will earn the first Academy Award for best picture, made with sound.\n\nMarch\n\nThe use of sound in movies is ruining the reputations of many technicians who are unable to adapt to the changes.\n\nMeanwhile, it is learned that Fox is overextended financially after its failed takeover of MGM in 1928. Owner William Fox may be forced to sell his studio.\n\nAcross town, budget-conscious Harry Cohn is hiring stars for a few days only at Columbia Pictures. He is shooting scenes for two or three films at the same time, then after the expensive star is finished, a cheaper supporting cast is used to fill in the rest of the movies.\n\nApril\n\nColumnist Louella Parsons is holding informal gatherings of female journalists. Some work for newspapers and others for fan magazines. But all of them cover Hollywood goings-on, and they meet each Wednesday at noon at the Brown Derby restaurant on Vine Street. Louella calls the group the Hollywood Women’s Press Club.\n\nUp along the coast, Malibu is beginning to become a popular residence for movie stars. Among those living there are actress Lilyan Tashman and her husband Edmund Lowe.\n\nMay\n\nOn the 16th, the first Academy Awards are handed out. The ceremony is held at the Roosevelt Hotel, hosted by Douglas Fairbanks and William deMille. Honorees enjoy a nice meal at tables with replicas of the newly designed statuette, illuminated by Chinese lanterns.\n\nBefore the evening is over, WINGS is named best picture, though it was made back in 1927. Emil Jannings and Janet Gaynor are the best performers for the past two years.\n\nJune\n\nOn the 3rd, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. marries Joan Crawford—but not without complications. Fairbanks is on the outs with his parents and has been disowned. Virtually penniless, he needs Joan to pay for everything. Joan’s boss, Louis B. Mayer, agrees to help by loaning his popular actress money for the wedding as well as some cash for a new home in Brentwood, where the couple will live.\n\nMeanwhile, there are problems down at the studio. Mayer and Irving Thalberg have recently released Norma Shearer’s latest film, THE TRIAL OF MARY DUGAN. But it has been banned by the Chicago Board of Censors. MGM will successfully lobby to have the bluenoses reverse the ban, by drumming up support from open-minded critics and moviegoers.\n\nOn June 30th, Alfred Hitchcock’s first hit sound film, BLACKMAIL, premieres in London.\n\nJuly\n\nRecent Oscar winner Emil Jannings is having trouble transitioning to sound film. He goes back to his native Germany when his Hollywood contract is cancelled. He will soon make THE BLUE ANGEL with German actress Marlene Dietrich, under director Josef von Sternberg.\n\nOn the 13th, the first Technicolor talkie ON WITH THE SHOW is released by Warners. A new color revolution begins.\n\nReverend William Sheafe Chase is organizing the Federal Motion Picture Council of America. His goal? Stricter censorship. Hollywood responds by promising voluntary control of its content.\n\nAugust\n\nBelieving Hollywood executives are not doing enough to control the content of their films, Reverend Chase and other high-ranking clergy draft a 4,000 word production code document. It covers language, costuming and societal attitudes.\n\nOn the 20th, HALLELUJAH!, the first Hollywood film with an all-black cast, premieres. Director King Vidor’s idea: to exploit popular stage revues featuring Negro singers and dancers. Specifically, he uses performers who appeared on the New York stage in Blackbirds of 1928.\n\nSeptember\n\nUniversal is producing a screen version of Erich Maria Remarque’s novel ‘All Quiet on the Western Front.’ Lewis Milestone, interested in the story’s pacifist themes, has been assigned to direct.\n\nOn the 28th, Winston Churchill arrives in Hollywood. He speaks at an MGM luncheon.\n\nOctober\n\nPublisher Martin Quigley and Father Daniel Lord meet with Joseph Breen to go over the production code document that has been written. Like Reverend Chase and his council, the men believe the motion picture industry needs specific guidelines in order to self-regulate movie content.\n\nRudy Vallee debuts on NBC radio on October 24th in The Fleischmann’s Yeast Hour. This is also Black Tuesday, the day the U.S. stock market crashes.\n\nNovember\n\nOn the 15th, MGM releases Greta Garbo’s last silent film, THE KISS. Her costar Lew Ayres, has been cast in Universal’s upcoming film version of ‘All Quiet on the Western Front.’\n\nAnd speaking of Universal, Carl Laemmle Jr.’s position as production manager at the studio is over. His brief tenure following in his famous father’s footsteps did not last long.\n\nDecember\n\nOne of Hollywood’s first gay bars opens this month, in time for New Year’s Eve celebrations. On the 31st, Jimmy’s Backyard bar attracts several notable guests. Among them are one of MGM’s top stars, William Haines; as well as actor Lowell Sherman. Also, director Edmund Lowe turns up with his wife, actress Lilyan Tashman. All the men are wearing tuxes.\n\nAnd before closing out 1929, here’s a look at stars that had their screen debuts this year:"
