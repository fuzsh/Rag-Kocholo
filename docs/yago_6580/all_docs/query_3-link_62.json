        "text": "The farce-comedy adapted by Seymour Hicks from a French play which turned up in London as \"Mr. What's His Name\" and was known during its very brief innings in this city, in 1927, as \"The Matrimonial Bed,\" after having masqueraded as \"What a Man!\" in the try-out zone, has been put into audible film form and is now at the Warners' Strand under its Broadway title. It possesses an idea with distinct possibilities, but while some of the incidents are humorous, the story as a whole misses fire, due perhaps largely to the many changes it has undergone since it left its native Paris.The picture cast is competent, but one or two of the players are not especially well suited to their rôles. The background is presumed to be Paris, but the performers as well as the dialogue make it a hybrid affair. It is, however, a yarn heaped with complications.Frank Fay acts Adolphe Noblet, a genial fellow who suffers from amnesia following a railroad wreck that occurred five years before the narrative commences. Noblet's wife has married again and has a child three years old. Noblet himself has taken another wife, after having gone to work as a barber. Several of his clients are in the habit of looking upon Noblet as a handsome man rather than as a barber.Juliette Corton, played intelligently by Florence Eldridge, decides to change her hairdresser and Noblet is recommended to her by her friend, Sylvaine (Lilyan Tashman) and also by her maid, Marianne. It happens, however, that Juliette is Noblet's wife and so when the barber arrives to attend to Mrs. Corton's hair everybody is amazed to see the man they thought to be dead walking into the room. They are further surprised when he does not recognize anybody. Yet, there is his portrait in oils over the mantelpiece and it chances that the day he puts in his appearance is the fitfh anniversary of the railroad accident.Dr. Friedland by his hypnotic influence succeeds in putting Noblet to sleep. When he is awakened Noblet recognizes everybody but those with whom he has had dealings as a barber. Dr. Friedland cautions all in the house that they must not allude to the accident or it may lead to Noblet's real end. As one can imagine, however, Noblet cannot be kept in the dark for long. Gustave Corton does not feel like permitting Noblet to embrace the woman he married three years ago and he is impelled to let Noblet know everything that has happened when the amnesia victim orders Corton from his house.Mr. Fay gives quite a satisfactory portrayal as Noblet. He has the opportunity to sing once or twice and handles the comic incidents in an easy fashion. Lilyan Tashman does creditable work as the fashionable Parisienne who is one of Noblet's keenest admirers. Beryl Mercer figures as a servant who is faithful to the amnesia victim's memory.\n\nFarcical Complications.THE MATRIMONIAL BED, with Frank Fay, James Gleason, Llyan Tashman, Beryl Mercer, Marion Byron, Florence Eldridge, Vivian Oakland, Arthur Edmund Carewe and James Bradbury, based on a French play, directed by Michael Curtiz. \"Love That Kills,\" a short film; \"Dude Ranching.\" At the Warners' Strand.The life and death of Rasputin, the \"Mad Monk,\" is the subject of a German production now at the Eighth Street Playhouse. It is called \"Rasputin: The Holy Devil,\" and parts of this silent picture are cleverly filmed with effective cinematic glimpses. The acting, however, is often unconvincing and exaggerated.Both the Czar and the Czarina are portrayed in this film, in which Nikalai Malikoff impersonates Rasputin, leaving nothing undone to make the monk a forbidding and repulsive specimen of humanity. In the main, the producer keeps to the facts, but there are several scenes that are wildly improbable.In the closing scenes Rasputin is lured to the home of Prince Yousoupoff, who, according to this chronicle, at first tries to poison the monk and afterward shoots him. Rasputin is believed to be dead, but he soon gets to his feet and another nobleman fires several times at him.In the meantime the Czarina is anxious to have the monk come to the palace because her little son is very ill. Prince Yousoupoff, before the slaying of the monk, goes to the telephone and denies to the Czarina that Rasputin is in his home. In this film Rasputin is too wily to drink the wine offered to him by the Prince. Finally, however, the monk suggests that the Prince exchange glasses of wine with him. The Prince does so and he lets the glass of poisoned wine drop to the floor.These last scenes are well acted by both the players, Jack Trevor being especially impressive as the nervous young Prince. M. Malikoff gives a strong impersonation, but there are certain incidents that are beyond belief. In one case a pretty girl accompanies a young officer to a cabaret where the monk is enjoying one of his frequent revels. No sooner has the girl taken a seat than she flirts with Rasputin. This part is poorly acted, and not well directed, for while Rasputin is dancing and kissing women's hands one would suppose that he would attract much attention. Few persons, however, appear to notice the presence of this repugnant individual.Ervin Kaiser plays the Czar and Diane Karene acts the Czarina.Other Photoplays.D. W.
