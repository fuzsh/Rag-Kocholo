        "text": "Lilyan Tashman (October 23, 1896 â€“ March 21, 1934) was a Brooklyn-born Jewish American vaudeville, Broadway, and film actress.\n\nLilyan was lesbian and this was considered an open secret in Hollywood. She had a four year long relationship with actress Greta Garbo. Lilyan married openly gay actor, Edmund Dantes Lowe, and together they became the darlings of Hollywood and were touted in fan magazines as having \"the ideal marriage\". They were known for throwing lavish A-list parties at their Beverly Hills Mansion, \"Lilowe\". Lilyan was considered one of the best dressed women of Hollywood with a wardrobe valued at $1,000,000.\n\nShe died of cancer in New York City on March 21, 1934, at the age of 37."
