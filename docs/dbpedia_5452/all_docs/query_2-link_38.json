        "text": "The idea that you don't need a degree, experience, or specific knowledge for a particular course can be misleading and a red flag. It's like dragons who haven't been to war‚Äîthey're not considered battle-hardened and usually have losing odds against fierce opponents. \"Although every dragon breathes fire üî• but it's not the same, Some are larger in size with more experience & techniques\" Knowing yourself is more important than chasing options promising high salaries from masterclasses. The chances are that 80% of what they teach won't apply to you, despite their claims of leading to a 50 lakh salary. Pick 3 core skills and resonate with the potential possibilities of what you can and cannot do. This self-awareness will guide your path better than any external promises. Understand your strengths and fight your own battles to succeed. Don't depend solely on others; instead, rely on your own sense of justice about what's right and wrong. ------- Follow here: Mohammed Noor G P.S. You need to fight your own battles to survive this winter and beyond.\n\nHey parents! üëã At Brilliant Tutors Academy, we believe in turning setbacks into stepping stones for success.

Then I saw this note I left for future learners. I may be just a designer or like everyone else, but optimistic support, an unwavering dedication to helping others and celebrating the little wins will always be forever. The best thing one can do while they wait for their chance, 'Help someone else get excited about the journey. There could be a thousand naysayers and gatekeepers in front of me telling me to temper expectations. Won't ever happen. Want to know why? Because I have four girls looking up to me to prove to them that they can do anything if they just be patient and persevere. If this journey has taught me anything, it is that negativity doesn't sleep. Guess what though? Neither does my optimism, my growth mindset, desire to help others, desire to make an impact in the world. You can tell me I can't. You can tell me I will never be a great designer. It's cool. Your opinion is more of value to you than me. Your feedback is what I crave. Learning and getting better is what I crave. Building relationships with those who uplift rather than tear down. Yeah, that is the ticket. You can tell me I am bad at something a thousand times. The 1001 is where I will impress you though. Stay positive network. One more case study to go and my portfolio will be exactly where I want it to be.\n\nQOTW: How many of us treat our jobs in the same way that we pursued earlier goals in life? Think back to that varsity sports/dance/choir team you wanted to make, the college acceptance letter you wanted to get, the degree you were hoping to earn, etc What things did you do? Study film weekly? Go to the gym daily? Study and read multiple hours a day? So why do so many of us ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù not treat our careers the same way. To all my former and future teammates, I challenge you to pursue your success with the same vigor and commitment. Study your craft. Master it. And continue to study it as it evolves."
