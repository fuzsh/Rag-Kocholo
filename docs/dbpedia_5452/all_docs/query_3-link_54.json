I assist customers who are having problems with their equipment by coordinating parts and help from our field service engineers to get their system back on track. My favorite part about Block Imaging is the collaborative atmosphere and being able to come to work everyday with a team I love! Outside of work I love spending time with my wife, hanging with friends, playing basketball, and all things Spartan athletics!"
