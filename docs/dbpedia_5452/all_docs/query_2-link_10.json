        "text": "Good morning, I am sitting outside on my lovely back porch, enjoying a cup of coffee and the cool breeze. The only sounds I hear are the 7 a.m. train (which I love), crickets, and birds. My neighbors say \"good morning\" over the fence. I am in love with this house and this town. I cannot wait to become a part of the community. I cannot express how much better I feel now. I want to thank you again, David. When Andy told me he called you about selling our home, I thought he was wasting your [...]\n\nLynn and Andy V.\n\n31 July 2024, 12:00 PM\n\nDavid Parks is the best real estate agent !\n\nAndrew and Lynn VanHecker\n\n12 July 2024, 14:14 PM\n\nDavid Parks made all the difference toward making the sale of the home a quick and easy process .David was very prompt, very polite and very professional. He has a wonderful positive outlook and pays attention to detail. He made the entire process a stress-free experience for me. Having relocated out of state to care for my aging mother, someday, I will need information regarding her property. I plan to return to Texas at some point and I will one again be contacting David Parks to find my new [...]\n\nRon Redford\n\n17 May 2024, 16:09 PM\n\nDavid Parks is by far the best real estate agent we have ever used. David is a man of integrity, a very hard worker and customer driven. He sold our house in 4 days at 30 k over our asking price. I have recommended David to many people and everybody says the same thing, That he is awesome. A true asset to Sothebys realty ! Again, we appreciate the outstanding service.\n\nMark Ondras\n\n05 May 2024, 14:39 PM\n\nDavid Parks was prompt, polite and professional. He made the selling process easy and stress free. He was there for me from start to finish. I greatly appreciate his patience with me, my questions and my insecurities. I will strongly recommend David to anyone I know who is looking to buy a home or sell their home. Thank you very much David for everything you did for me.\n\nRon Redford\n\n26 April 2024, 16:55 PM\n\nEverything went very well and any and all questions or help needed during sale were answered or taken care of quickly and professionally.\n\nGregg Swihart\n\nDavid found a buyer on his own -- before we could even market the property -- and navigated the whole process, despite a very difficult situation -- with class, dignity and high communication. Thank you, David!\n\nTrinsessa LLC\n\nMy husband and I were very pleased with the friendliness, hard work and efficiency we experienced from our realtor, Dave Parks. From the moment we met him, he had a totally can-do attitude. He was able to work within our limited time constraints and make the sale happen. He brought us good information, options, and resources and was able to get us into the houses we wanted to see. He was a great guy to work with. He even went the extra mile and allowed us to keep our car at his house until [...]\n\nBrenda Fenderson\n\nDavid was on it from day 1. Always gave us honest and straightforward feedback and told us how it was, not what we wanted to hear. He was super responsive to our calls and texts. We flew in from out of town on a Friday night late and took our call at 9:30pm to agree to work with us. Would trust him again and highly recommend.\n\nScott Simpson\n\nI wanted to sell quickly so I sought offers from flippers on Facebook. When my long time friend, David Parks, read my post, he contacted me immediately convincing me to let him help me avoid what could have been a financial disaster. David managed to help me get $38,000 more than I was asking and $88,000 more than what I probably would have settled for. I could not be happier. The entire process went smoothly. I knew the market was hot and my home was listed for just 4 days. It was David Parks [...]\n\nMark M."
