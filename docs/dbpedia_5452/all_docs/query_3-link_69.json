I attended Gainesville Jr. College where I ran track and cross country and received my Associates in Education. I continued my education at the University of Georgia where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's of Education degrees. This school year I will be instructing Social Skills. We will learn how to better handle ourselves when interacting with peers, teachers, adults and those in authority. Additionally we will explore what makes each one of us special and unique so we can share the best of ourselves.",
