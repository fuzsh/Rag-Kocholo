        "text": "I was in Denver when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. My band was recording an album there, but we joined the rest of the world watching the terrible, unfolding events live on TV. We saw (and felt) fighter jets flying overhead. There was another World Trade Center site in Denver, and nobody knew if it could be another target. By the end of the day, almost 3,000 people had died. We were shocked. Whatever happened next, we knew that September 11, 2001, would profoundly impact our world. And it did.\n\nTwenty years later, I think of the fact that my kids have never known a different world. I think of airport security, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Dept of Homeland Security. I think of phrases like enhanced interrogation, shock and awe, WMD, IED, and PTSD. I think of veterans who served mightly and sacrificed so much. I think of firefighters who suffer from working in the dust of the twin towers. I watched Hollywood wrestle with the meaning of all this on Fox’s 24, American Sniper, The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty, and last week, 9/11: Inside the President’s War Room. So much fear. So much violence. So little resolution. So little peace.\n\nLet’s have a moment of silence. Let’s pause and think about these momentously tragic things. But let us apply the light of God’s Word to our darkness.\n\nPsalm 46\n\nGod is our refuge and strength,\n\nan ever-present help in trouble.\n\nTherefore we will not fear, though the earth give way\n\nand the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,\n\nthough its waters roar and foam\n\nand the mountains quake with their surging.\n\nThere is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,\n\nthe holy place where the Most High dwells.\n\nGod is within her, she will not fall;\n\nGod will help her at break of day.\n\nNations are in uproar, kingdoms fall;\n\nhe lifts his voice, the earth melts.\n\nThe LORD Almighty is with us;\n\nthe God of Jacob is our fortress.\n\nCome and see what the LORD has done,\n\nthe desolations he has brought on the earth.\n\nHe makes wars cease\n\nto the ends of the earth.\n\nHe breaks the bow and shatters the spear;\n\nhe burns the shields with fire.\n\nHe says, “Be still, and know that I am God;\n\nI will be exalted among the nations,\n\nI will be exalted in the earth.”\n\nThe Lord Almighty is with us;\n\nthe God of Jacob is our fortress.\n\nIf ever we experience days of death and despair again, let us put our hope in God, our refuge and strength. He is over the nations. He is our fortress, our peace, and is the Father of compassion. And one day, Jesus will wipe every tear from our eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things will have passed away. We pray and work for peace and justice and life in the here and now. But we also wait for that day with eager expectation. Maranatha! Come, Lord Jesus!\n\nHurricane Ida’s destructive power has got nothing on the winds of hate blowing through our news feeds. Thundering outrage. Storm surging fear. New enemies every week. New threats every day. Some people are too stressed to function. Others, too suspicious to trust anything. This treadmill of vitriol is increasing violence and addiction and is breaking us apart.\n\nLord, have mercy.\n\nJesus said his followers should be a light, a city on a hill, a beacon for those walking in darkness. So, are we? Are we in the Church different or do we look pretty much like the surrounding culture? Oh sure, we have Bible verses to back our memes. But do those walking in darkness see a great light? Do our neighbors see the Church as a real countercultural community so full of goodness that even non-believers give glory to God? (Mt 5:14-16)\n\nRight now, I don’t think so. Too many individual lights are being dimmed by the winds of political controversy. From the outside, the city on a hill looks more like a suburban Babylon: the same fear, anger, and hate, but with a little God sprinkled in.\n\nSeriously, Lord Jesus, what might help us? Was it any different 2,000 years ago? Was it easier to be a Christian then? Well, I guess they killed you, didn’t they? And they persecuted your disciples. Actually, that sounds worse than today. So what did your people do then?\n\n1. They made friends.\n\nOn the night before the cross, Jesus could’ve talked about anything. But he emphasized the love his disciples ought to have for each other. “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.” (Jn 15:12) This was a command, not a suggestion and was supposed to be the defining characteristic of his people. When the Apostle Paul wrote to the Church in Thessaloniki, he praised them saying, “And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia.” (1Th4:10) This was a church that looked like a church.\n\nWhat does this have to do with friendship? Well, what is a friend other than someone you choose to love? The Thessalonians had made friends throughout the whole region! What if our friendships in the Church reflected God’s unconditional love for us? What if we served (and even enjoyed!) people without requiring theological or ideological agreement? Would Paul praise us if he wrote to us today? Would Jesus be pleased with our obedience to his command?\n\n2. They weren’t trying to change the world, but they did.\n\nAfter praising their love for all, Paul encouraged his friends to live a pretty normal life. In fact, he said, “make it your ambition to lead a quiet life” (1Th 4:11). A quiet life. A life of stability and hope. A life of independence and hard work, serving the needs of others. Yes, there are times when our faith needs to be defended. But even then, our guiding principles are gentleness and respect (1Pe 3:15). Whatever we do must show the fruit of the Spirit, not our flesh (Gal 5:22-23). “Opponents must be gently instructed” (2Ti 2:25), not ridiculed or reviled. This quiet, loving, gospel-saturated life was a counterculture life 2,000 years ago. But the Church gleamed as a city on a hill, and the world was never the same. They weren’t trying to change the world, but they did.\n\nIs there hope for the Church today? Absolutely, yes. Eventually, even the strongest storm will pass. And in the end, Jesus will return and calm the storms once and for all. But in the meantime, we can make friends in the hurricane. We, too, can live a quiet life according to the command of Christ. We, too, can walk with gentleness and respect. In fact, we just might enjoy it!\n\nLord, lead us in this way of love. And let your light shine among us so that those living in the land of deep darkness say, “A light has dawned.” Amen.\n\nSo. We made it. A new year is a comforting sight after a year so thoroughly shot-through with uncertainty, chaos, division, and strife. 2020 was a year of hardship, but also of hidden fruit. God was undoubtedly at work — maybe doing more in one year than in ten. But we couldn’t see much of the fruit right away because of isolation and social disruption. We’re just now starting to see the shoots of new growth breaking through the topsoil, signs of life, healing, and renewal.\n\nFruit Revealed\n\nWhere am I starting to see fruit from 2020? In three areas. First, I see a broad social humbling in our true limitations. We aren’t as invincible as we used to think. Human beings are very strong in some ways, but we are also weak. Realizing our weakness isn’t a bad thing when it reflects real, God-given limitations. Despite wonderful advancements in science and medicine, COVID-19 exposed just how vulnerable we are to disease — something that’s always been true. Pride is the path to sin and self, a road to destruction. Humility is a gentle friend, one that helps us embrace our limits and see our need for the grace of God. 2020 humbled us, exposed our weakness, need for help, and mortality. More humility is ultimately a tremendous blessing. The fact is, we were no more vulnerable in 2020 than we were in 2019 or that we will be in 2021. The truth about our weakness is a light to our path, one that will help us walk humbly in the truth. And the truth will set us free.\n\nSecond, I see a crumbling of faulty foundations. This fruit is related to the first but is deeper than our health and well-being. In the earthquake of COVID-19, many realized their foundation, the thing(s) they had built their lives on, was(were) shaken — easily shaken. Cracks and fault lines appeared that had been hidden in more comfortable times. When push came to shove, the psychological foundation crumbled under their feet. And this newfound instability was profoundly unsettling. I wouldn’t wish this sort of existential crisis on anyone. But again, if what was exposed (e.g., a bad foundation) was reality, then this is the mercy of God. In contrast, a common refrain in the Psalms is the eternal stability of the Lord God Almighty.\n\nI love you, Lord, my strength.\n\nThe Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;\n\nmy God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,\n\nmy shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.\n\nPsalm 18:1-2\n\n“God is our refuge and strength,\n\nan ever-present help in trouble.\n\nTherefore we will not fear, though the earth give way\n\nand the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,\n\nthough its waters roar and foam\n\nand the mountains quake with their surging.”\n\nPsalm 46:1-3\n\nWe may not face another threat exactly like COVID-19 in the future. But there will be times of shaking. And when the mountains quake, there is a foundation to build your life on that will remain secure, unshakable. His name is Jesus. He is the rock that cannot be moved. Other relationships and people may come and go. Your work or wealth may not last. Political parties and policies shift like sand. Beauty fades. If you build your life on any of these things, your foundation will eventually crumble. Realizing this now instead of 10, 20, or 30 years from now is the mercy of God, an incredible blessing. A secure foundation is only found in Christ, the Rock, the Chief Cornerstone. And he will not fail.\n\nThird, I see a new openness to God. Hard times have a way of snapping what really matters back into our focus. Prayer is easy in the dark of night and easy to forget in the brightness of day. For a season, many people will be spiritually open, seeking meaning or answers or peace. And these longings point heavenward. Christians must be aware of this, watching and praying, willing to help those who are seeking. Some predict an era of excessive consumption similar to the Roaring ’20s (which followed the trauma of WWI). And that might be. But I believe a time of spiritual renewal is also possible. And given the disruption caused by the crumbling of faulty foundations and the broad social humbling, I think revival is not just possible but is likely. As C.S. Lewis wrote in The Problem of Pain, “God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.” Many of our friends and neighbors are starting to hear and heed his calling. May we have the courage to love and serve and share good news when the time is right.\n\nGod was not surprised or nervous by what we faced in 2020 (not that that means it was supposed to be easy for us!). And we are only starting to see the good that He brought out of the pain and difficulty of our year. In the new year, a year full of newness and potential and growth and change, may we see and enjoy more and more of the hidden fruit as it’s revealed — and praise God, from whom all blessings flow. He is good, and he is faithful, both now and forevermore.\n\n“Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit…”\n\nEphesians 5:18\n\nThe Desire to Escape\n\nI think it was last year that I found out that ostriches don’t actually stick their heads in the sand when they’re afraid. It’s a popular misconception, but according to National Geographic Kids (and a bunch of sites for grownups), ostriches do stick their heads into the ground, but only to care for their eggs. And obviously not for very long otherwise, they would suffocate!\n\nSo ostriches may not hide in the sand at the first sign of danger. However, in this broken world, full of danger, disappointment, and difficulty, when normal life can be utterly exhausting and overwhelming, the impulse to stick your head in the sand is not only attractive. The desire to escape is a universal experience. Can I get an amen?\n\nSome “escapes” can be fun and memorable. Southwest Airlines advertises “Wanna Get Away” rates to fly you somewhere warm or beautiful or historic (or just different). Travel and time off can be a fantastic way to relax, make memories, and recharge for the next season of life. But most people can’t afford regular trips to the mountains or the beach. Even the ones who can afford it aren’t immune to stress and anxiety. So the desire to escape endures, even after a nice vacation.\n\nWays to Escape\n\nThere are many ways to escape from stress and anxiety that are healthy and good — going for a bike ride, having coffee with a friend, working out, taking a nap, having a date night with your spouse, learning a new hobby, reading a good book, baking bread, and so many more.\n\nHowever, many forms of escape are equally dangerous and destructive. And here’s where the problems often come in. Alcohol can be an escape. A few drinks aren’t necessarily harmful. But as the Apostle Paul noted (in the verse above), drunkenness is often the context for all sorts of problems. The combination of fear and uncertainty in 2020, mixed with way more time at home pushed many people into dangerous territory with alcohol this year. Last week, a report showed that overall car accidents were down in Wisconsin from March to July this year. However, “Alcohol-involved crashes were up 50%,” which contributed to a rise in overall traffic deaths. That’s clearly not good.\n\nPainkillers and other drugs can be an escape. The number of people who overdosed on opioids increased so much since 2013 (with a spike in 2017) that the average US life expectancy temporarily decreased. That’s a national tragedy.\n\nOvereating, binge-watching Netflix, and losing hours of your life scrolling Facebook or TikTok may not be as immediately dangerous as drugs and alcohol. But let’s be honest. Do these escapes lead to a more flourishing life? No. They may in fact contribute more to anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and to less energy and immunity. Not good.\n\nBetter Than an Escape\n\nThe Apostle Paul entreats the church in Ephesus, “Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit…” (Eph 5:18) So, how is being drunk (filled) with wine related to being filled with the Holy Spirit? Here’s how. Both represent ways of dealing with reality.\n\nDrunkenness allows you to temporarily forget about reality. To disconnect, to have a brief respite from real causes of stress and strain at home, at work, with COVID-19 or politics, etc. The pressure isn’t imaginary. The pain isn’t make-believe. But this way of dealing with reality (by temporary escape) doesn’t work. In the short run, it can be dangerous and self-destructive. In the long run, you’ll be even more tired, unhealthy, and your troubles won’t be any better! Dealing with reality by drinking is like paying for one credit card debt with another credit card. You’re just kicking the problem further down the road.\n\nBeing filled with the Spirit is the opposite of this. The Holy Spirit allows you to live in reality. But not in a way that leaves you hopeless or helpless! The Spirit opens your eyes to see reality through the redemptive lens of the gospel. To see that this world (and your life) is a broken and messed up place — full of heartache and injustice with all sorts of (appropriate!) causes for anxiety and depression. But the Holy Spirit is the power and presence of God in the world. By the power of the Spirit, we can be made alive in Christ. And by the truth of God’s Word and the power of the Spirit, we can have the faith to see that God is doing something about all this heartbreaking mess. That God is bringing redemption and healing and new creation and the light of truth into the darkness of reality.\n\nThis is why Paul goes on in Ephesians 5:19-20, saying instead, “…speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”\n\nWorship, singing, and expressing gratitude with other believers (not alone in isolation), these are vital practices for the Christian life. Especially when we feel the desire to hit the eject button and find some sort of escape.\n\nThe truth is that this world will one day come to an end. And Jesus will wipe every tear from our eyes. “There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” (Rev 21:4). But until that day, and especially during this uniquely stressful Christmas season, we have everything we need to endure and have joy and find peace and so much more in Christ.\n\nDon’t run from reality, as painful and stressful as it can be at times! Embrace reality by the power of the Spirit and the truth of the Gospel. Remind yourself of what’s true. Take shelter in the Rock. You’ll find the well of heavenly resources runs far deeper and is far better and more life-giving than any worldly escape. Remember what Jesus said. “In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33). Amen. Come quickly, Lord.\n\n*This article addresses serious emotional issues. If you or a loved one is in immediate danger, please call 911. If you are struggling and need help, please let us know.\n\nOur Father in heaven,\n\nWe come to you on this Election Day with a prayer for our nation. In a year of unprecedented levels of uncertainty, chaos, fear, and anger —family and neighbors are more divided than ever. Our religious practices (or lack thereof), divisive politics, and social media echo chambers have eroded the moral fabric of our society. People no longer disagree with respect and civility. People are pridefully unwilling to listen, learn, or compromise for the common good. Injustice and sin are rampant — fear and anger are overwhelming. It feels like the darkness is swallowing up the light. Will this somehow end after the election? Will “we the people” find a way to come together and heal?\n\nFather, as a nation, we confess that in many ways we have rejected you. We have not followed your ways. We have put our hope in the economy, government, science and technology, presidents and judges, social justice movements, and even in freedom itself in your place. Please forgive us. Forgive our pride, our foolishness, our indifference to the poor, and our disregard for our neighbor. Forgive us for trusting anyone or anything in your place. Please help us to turn toward you as a people, as a nation. Have compassion on us; deliver us from the darkness of today. Sweep us into a spiritual awakening such that we’ve never seen before. Only you, in your sovereign grace, can bring the healing, justice, peace, and life that we long for. We trust that you will — in your timing and wisdom.\n\nFather, would you grant our governing leaders — including our president, senators, congress, judges, governor, and mayor — faith, wisdom, truth, and courage. We pray that they would be effective in restraining evil and flourish in working for the common good. Protect them and provide for their needs. Help them to be models of civility, goodness, righteousness, and love.\n\nAnd finally, Father, would you empower us, your people, your church, to be salt and light in this dark world? Please help us keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, by the power of the Holy Spirit. Sanctify us, Lord. Purify us to be men and women who radiate the beauty and glory of the image of God into the world as we love our neighbors as ourselves. Help us to love them as Christ loved us — sacrificially and wholeheartedly, in grace and in truth.\n\nWe love you, Father. We give thanks to you now (no matter who wins the day), for you are good, and your love endures forever. In Jesus’ name, we pray.\n\nAmen.\n\n2020, am I right?? Of course we are smack in the middle of an unprecedented (I feel like we use that word a lot nowadays) election season. Online conventions, vast swathes of conspiracy theory believers, virus caused uncertainty, a brutally divided electorate, and so very much more. Some mature, Bible-believing Christians think the issues are very black and white. Easy. Other mature, Bible-believing Christians are wrestling with what they see as extremely complex and challenging choices. Hard. Some want to run and hide until the election is over. Others are running toward the fray with memes, signs, and other paraphernalia in tow. What are Christians supposed to do??\n\nI want to propose 4 Rules of Engagement for Christians in an election year. These aren’t new ideas but gospel-centered principles that should shape every area of our lives (including our politics).\n\n1. We are people who are saved by grace, so we must give grace to all.\n\n“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith — and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — not by works, so that no one can boast.” (Eph 2:8-9) Grace means you didn’t earn your way into God’s love, blessing, or acceptance through your perfection, worthiness, intelligence, or politics. Grace is the unmerited favor of God, as demonstrated through the person and work of Jesus Christ. If you accept God’s grace for yourself but fail to give grace to others — including your political opponent — you are not walking in line with the gospel. Let me say it stronger. You are behaving in a way that is anti Christ. Jesus laid down his life for us while we were his enemies so that we might become brothers and sisters. Grace isn’t devoid of truth (after all, Jesus was full of grace and truth, Jn 1:14, also, see number 3 below), but grace must shape our engagement in politics.\n\nAm I gracious toward people of differing beliefs?\n\nAm I gracious in my tone, or am I rude, condescending, or mean-spirited?\n\nAm I demonstrating grace in what I share online?\n\n2. We are to obey the commands of Christ. These are not suggestions.\n\nJesus doesn’t kindly suggest that we love our enemies. Jesus commands us to love our enemy and pray for those who persecute us. And he knows this is contrary to what everyone else is doing. He knows this will differ from what you’ve seen and heard before (Mt 5:43-47). The Apostle Paul says to bless and do not curse. He says not to repay evil with evil, but to repay evil with good (Ro 12:14-21). The highest and most beautiful example of this is seen in Jesus dying on the cross for sinful people while praying for forgiveness for those who were actively crucifying him. If you only love those who share your political views, what reward will you get? Christians do not get a free pass in the political arena to disobey the clear commands of Christ.\n\nDo I love my political enemy in my attitude, words, and deeds?\n\nDo I pray for and bless those who are actively against me?\n\nDo I compartmentalize my politics and faith, or does my faith shape my politics?\n\n3. We are to be people who believe and speak the truth.\n\nJesus is the embodiment of truth (Jn 14:6), and the gospel reveals the reality of our world. So when we fail to believe, speak, or share what is true, again, we are not living in line with the gospel. God has commanded us not to give false testimony against our neighbor, including our political opponents (Ex 20:16). There are many Proverbs about the power of our speech and the wisdom of controlling our tongue. Politicians and political groups use smear campaigns, disinformation, fake news, outright lies, conspiracies, name-calling, and oh so much more. Politicians know how to expertly fan the flames of these falsehoods to get their base fired up and burn their opponents. This is not our way, and these are not our tactics. Christians are to speak the truth in love to build one another up (Eph 4:11-16).\n\nAm I careful to only share what I know to be true? (i.e., not “verified” by 3 friends on Facebook and a “secret” YouTube channel)\n\nAm I honest when representing my opponent’s views?\n\nAm I thinking through political issues, policies, and candidates in light of the truth of the gospel?\n\n4. We are people who have an undying hope.\n\nOur hope is not in our president or our politics. Our hope doesn’t lie in Washington D.C. Our hope isn’t found in our constitution or the Republican or Democratic parties. Real hope, Christian hope, is found only ever in the person and work of Jesus Christ. No matter what happens in our country or our politics, we cannot lose our hope — because our hope is in heaven. Our future is secure. And Jesus is the risen and reigning King, not just of the USA, but of the whole of creation. So if our candidate or our policies or our party wins or loses, it doesn’t touch the hope that we have in Jesus.\n\nAm I hopeful for the future in Christ, or am I afraid of the future for political reasons?\n\nAm I trusting in the reign of Jesus more than political candidates, policies, and parties?\n\nAm I ready to share the reasons for the hope that I have with gentleness and respect (1Pe 3:15)?\n\nMay we be people who are shaped, in every area of life, by grace, love, truth, and hope. May these principles guide us in the days and years to come. May God lift us out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire that defines American politics today. May he set our feet on the Rock and help us to sing once again (Psalm 40).\n\nOur REACH Campaign is all about investing in a place (our new building) where we can share good news, people can learn to follow Jesus (be disciples), and help others do the same (make disciples). For some weird reason, God wants us to join him in his work of redeeming and renewing all things in Christ. I would think he’d do a much better job on his own! But God is a good Father, and he wants us, his children, to learn the “family business.” In the process, we learn and grow and are shaped by God’s grace and love while we live out our created purpose of loving God and neighbor.\n\nAs I’ve been reflecting on the mission/vision/purpose of our church, I’ve been thinking about the people that God has used to help shape the direction and character of my life and faith. Of course, God gets all the glory, but I wouldn’t be the man I am today without the influence of these men. 5 Men Who Influenced My Life:\n\n1. My Dad\n\nMy dad has always been a faithful example to me of what a godly man looks like. He read his Bible (usually WAY before we woke up) and didn’t make a big deal out of it. He prayed and wasn’t embarrassed about it. He brought us to church and humbly served in ways that belied his education and intelligence. He stayed married and didn’t abandon his family. He worked hard and earned the respect of his coworkers. As a kid, he brought me along as he served lunch at the Salvation Army modeling the importance of serving the poor and those in need. He has supported me as a musician, a businessman, and a pastor and he loves my wife and kids well. Thank you.\n\n2. Dave Lehman\n\nI can now say with experience that being a pastor is hard but good. It’s not a higher calling than being a teacher, police officer, or engineer, for all can glorify God with their lives and vocation. But it’s an important job. My youth pastor, Dave Lehman, was very influential to me in middle and high school—a time when I was starting to take ownership of my faith. It was quite clear that Dave loved Jesus, his wife, his kids, and us squirrelly, sometimes serious youth group kids. He was a wild man who welcomed the nonbeliever, understood our culture, faithfully taught the Bible, and expected us, even at a young age, to get it (and we did!). Thank you.\n\n3. John Hartenberger\n\nIn my mid-twenties, John Hartenberger was my senior pastor. John was another wild man with an unbreakable heart for the lost and the least among us. When John invited me to join the teaching team and preach every few months, I jumped in not knowing how much God would use this to change me. John spent hours with me talking about the Bible, my faith, and eventually, my calling to vocational ministry and church planting. John supported me publicly and privately, and I’m grateful that he took the risk of giving a young punk a platform to preach. Thank you.\n\n4. Tim Keller\n\nInfluence can be up close or from a distance. Tim Keller is the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City and is an incredibly influential Christian author and speaker. Even though I don’t know him personally, I think I’ve read/heard just about everything he ever wrote/said. I was listening to his lecture Why Plant Churches when God called me to plant Appleton Gospel. Reading his book The Reason for God showed me that I could be a Christian and not check my brain at the door. His passion for the centrality of the gospel in life and his ability to preach with the unbeliever in mind has dramatically influenced my ministry. Thank you.\n\n5. Chris Dolson\n\nWhen I was born, my parents attended Blackhawk Church in Madison, WI. Years later, as I was starting to sense God’s call for me to vocational ministry, I listened to a sermon series from Chris Dolson and Tim Mackie at Blackhawk that would forever change my way of thinking about the Bible. The Story series opened my eyes to the reality that the Bible wasn’t just a collection of faith stories, but one great story—God’s story—that followed the narrative arc of creation, fall, redemption, and new creation. It was, as Pastor Chris said, a game changer. And ever since, I’ve had a driving passion to invite people into this story! Over the years, Chris went from being influential from a distance to becoming a mentor, generous with his time and wisdom. Thank you.\n\nPart of the REACH Campaign is a commitment to becoming people of influence—disciples who make disciples. Our church will not let the next generation stumble blindly through life. Rather, we will be men and women in different roles, vocations, ages, and life stages who will model what it looks like to follow Jesus. In so doing, we’ll join our Heavenly Father in the good work of redemption and renewal that he’s doing in the world. And what could be better than that??\n\nWho has God used to influence your life?"
