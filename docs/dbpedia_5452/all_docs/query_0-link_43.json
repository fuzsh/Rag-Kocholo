        "text": "Ochsner J. 2015 Spring; 15(1): e1–e31.\n\nPMCID: PMC4365858\n\nPMID: 25829893\n\n15th Annual Southern Hospital Medicine Conference Abstracts\n\nCopyright © Academic Division of Ochsner Clinic Foundation\n\n1 Virus-Induced CD28 Down-Regulation as a Driver of Costimulation-Resistant Allograft Rejection\n\nDanny Mou, MD; Emory Transplant Center, Atlanta, GA, Jaclyn Espinosa; Emory Transplant Center, Atlanta, GA, Jean Kwun, PhD; Emory Transplant Center, Atlanta, GA, Linda Stempora; Emory Transplant Center, Atlanta, GA, Neal Iwakoshi, PhD; Emory Transplant Center, Atlanta, GA, Allan Kirk, MD, PhD; Emory Transplant Center, Atlanta, GA\n\nBackground: Belatacept, a B7-specific fusion protein that blocks cluster of differentiation (CD) 28-B7 costimulation to prevent kidney allograft rejection, is ineffective in a sizable minority of transplant recipients. Although T cell receptor and CD28 engagement initiates T cell activation, many human antigen-experienced memory T cells (TMs) lose CD28 and can be activated without CD28 signals. We posit that these cells are central drivers of belatacept-resistant rejection (BRR) and propose that they may arise from antigen exposure. CD28 loss is poorly described in mice, which are typically kept in pathogen-free conditions.\n\nMethods: To study mice in a clinically relevant scenario of viral exposure, we characterized T cell CD28 expression after sequential infections, 3 weeks apart, with polyomavirus (PyV), BK virus homolog, murine Cytomegalovirus (mCMV), and mHV68 (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] homolog). Five mice cohorts, each containing 10 C57BL/6 mice, were defined as mock infections, single PyV infection, single mCMV infection, single mHV68 infection, or “all 3” infections. Flow analysis was performed on the day of infection, at peak infection, and at the memory time point. Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) were conducted to assess alloreactivity. In vitro alloreactivity was assessed both in the presence and absence of costimulation blockade (CTLA4-Ig, MR1). We are currently performing heart transplants in infected and uninfected mice to assess the phenotypic role of CD28 loss in BRR.\n\nResults: CD28 microflow imaging analysis of both CD4 and CD8 cells showed significant (P<0.05) CD28 down-regulation in the effector TMs for all infected cohorts. MLRs revealed that the mHV68 and triple-infected cohorts exhibited significantly higher alloreactivity than the naïve cohorts. Interestingly, the triple-infected cohort demonstrated significantly more interferon gamma production than the mHV68 cohort. The increased alloreactivity is resistant to costimulation blockade.\n\nConclusion: Clinically relevant viruses PyV, mCMV, and mHV68 induce CD28 down-regulation in mice, suggesting that PyV, CMV, and EBV infections may play a role in human BRR. Additionally, mHV68 exposure confers enhanced alloreactivity in MLRs, suggesting that viruses may lead to functionally relevant changes in the immune repertoire. The MLR observation that the triple-infected cohort produced more interferon gamma than the mHV68 cohort is suggestive of an additive alloreactivity effect driven by multiple viral infections. Overall, the data suggest that clinically relevant viruses may play a significant role in determining how solid organ transplant patients respond to costimulation blockade therapies.\n\n2 Control of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Infection in the Hospital Setting\n\nAli Hassoun, MD; Alabama Infectious Disease Center, Huntsville, AL, Pavan Panchavati, MD; Alabama Infectious Disease Center, Huntsville, AL\n\nBackground: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative (MDRGN) Bacillus commonly associated with nosocomial infections, especially hospital-acquired pneumonia and central line–related infections. The organism is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nMethods: We studied the implementation of contact isolation practices in addition to standard precautions in patients infected with this organism. Data were reviewed over 5 years for documented infection with clinical diagnosis and positive cultures. We assessed the efficacy of this intervention to reduce the transmission and infection rate.\n\nResults: The study was conducted in a 941-bed tertiary medical center in north Alabama with 100 ICU beds and average monthly patient days of 19,693 in 2013. Contact isolation was implemented in 2008 for all patients infected with S maltophilia; in 2007 we had 183 reported infections with positive culture that increased to 187 in 2008. After initiation of the intervention, we saw a significant decline in documented infections to only 36 infections in 2013—more than an 80% reduction despite annual patient days over the 5 years remaining stable. This result was compared to other Gram-negative bacilli, especially Acinetobacter baumannii, extended spectrum beta-lactamase–producing organisms, and MDRGN organisms that usually require isolation. None showed a decrease in infection rate. The most common sources of S maltophilia were respiratory (56%), wound and surgical specimen (20%), and bloodstream infection (9%). Interestingly, the infection affected more males than females (64% vs 36%); more than 65% of patients were 55 years or older; and infection was very rare in patients aged 15 years or younger. Organism susceptibility over 5 years did not change significantly, with 56% susceptible to ceftazidime, 86% susceptible to levofloxacin, and 97% susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.\n\nConclusion: Implementation of contact isolation for patients with S maltophilia was an effective intervention to reduce the rate of this serious infection. Further studies are required to assess and confirm the benefits of this measure, especially for S maltophilia and other MDRGN organisms.\n\n3 Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) vs Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test (RIDT) for the Diagnosis of H1N1 Severe Infection for Hospitalized Patients\n\nKhushdeep Chahal, MD; UAB Huntsville Internal Medicine Residency Program, Huntsville, AL; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Esmeralda Asia, MD; UAB Huntsville Internal Medicine Residency Program, Huntsville, AL; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Ali Hassoun, MD; Alabama Infectious Disease Center, Huntsville, AL; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Pavan Kumar Panchavati, MD; Huntsville Hospital, Huntsville, AL; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC\n\nBackground: The 2013-2014 influenza seasons were associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The influenza A virus, especially pandemic 2009 H1N1, was predominant. The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to use the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) for initial testing of suspected patients and then treating them does not reflect the latest advances in diagnostic methods and lacks an emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention in the healthcare setting.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review of 264 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center during the 2013-2014 influenza season was conducted. We included all patients with respiratory symptoms who had reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RIDT for diagnosis of influenza. In addition, we assessed the impact of RT-PCR use for diagnosis of H1N1 and its effect on neuraminidase inhibitor and antimicrobial prescription, as well as isolation practices.\n\nResults: Of 264 patient charts reviewed, the age range was 1-100 years with a mean age of 57 years, 48.5% of patients were male, and 51.5% of patients were female. Thirty percent were confirmed to have H1N1 by RT-PCR: 59% were female, 23% were 51-60 years, 22% were 61-70 years, and 16% were 31-40 years. RIDT had sensitivity of 19.77% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.96%-29.75%), specificity of 98.00% (95% CI 94.26%-99.56%), positive predictive value of 85.00% (95% CI 62.08%-96.62%), and negative predicative value of 68.06% (95% CI 61.39%-74.22%). By using RT-PCR, we are able to save 292 days of Tamiflu in patients with a negative test. In those patients with positive RT-PCR, we noticed a 63-day delay of initiation of Tamiflu, with a mean of 5 days in those who had an initial negative RIDT. Fifty-six days of unnecessary antibiotics were saved, with a mean of 5 days for patients with a positive RT-PCR. For the patients with a false-negative RIDT, cumulative delays of 152 days in isolation were noted. For patients with a negative RT-PCR, 239 days of inappropriate isolation were saved, with a mean of 11 days by early discontinuation.\n\nConclusion: RT-PCR for the diagnosis of H1N1 infection in hospitalized patients should be the initial diagnostic test, as it will help in prompt sensitive detection of influenza A, eliminate the need to treat on suspicion, and decrease the cost of unnecessary isolation and use of hospital resources. It would also impact infection control. Correctly identifying influenza patients early would translate into a decreased likelihood of influenza transmission to family members and healthcare professionals.\n\n4 Patient Acuity Scores to Prevent Rapid Responses\n\nChristopher O'Donnell, MD; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Samantha Thomas, BS; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Crystal Johnson, RN; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Lalit Verma, MD; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, Jonathan Bae, MD; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, David Gallagher, MD; Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC\n\nBackground: In the last 10 years, patient safety committees nationwide have focused on creating taskforces such as rapid response teams (RRTs) that can intervene when patients start to decompensate prior to a code. At Duke Regional Hospital, approximately 50% of RRT activations were found to occur during the first 24 hours of a patient's stay. Unlike critical care medicine, internal medicine does not have a widely accepted scale to grade the severity of illness. A scale was developed by Edelson et al in 2011 to quantify the likelihood of decompensation. The Duke hospitalists adapted this scale and used it prospectively to determine whether there was a correlation in the presenting acuity of illness and the number of RRT interventions in the first 24 hours and to see if there would be a decrease from year to year.\n\nMethods: A patient acuity score was adapted with permission, and patients were graded prospectively from admission. Patient data from June to December 2013 was summarized using N (%) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables. Patients transferred to resident service were excluded from the analysis, making the effective sample size 4,322 patients. The differences in mean severity score by occurrence of an RRT intervention in multiple categories were examined using analysis of variance. The total number of RRT interventions (at any time, within 12 hours, and within 24 hours) and unplanned transfers for June to December in 2012 and 2013 were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for independent nonparametric samples. Additionally RRT interventions were grouped by score of 5 and above vs 4 and below and analyzed via chi square test.\n\nResults: From June to December 2013, there were a total of 4,577 encounters by the hospitalists. A total of 4,322 patients met inclusion criteria. Ninety-two percent of the patients had a recorded acuity score. An RRT intervention occurred in 113 patients. Mean acuity scores were compared between subgroups. There were significant differences in mean acuity scores between patients who experienced an RRT intervention at any time and those who did not, patients who experienced an RRT intervention within 12 hours of admission and those who did not, patients who experienced an RRT intervention within 24 hours of admission and those who did not, and patients who underwent an unplanned transfer and those who did not (all P<0.007). It is notable that 100% of the level 7 scores that had a rapid response were transferred to the critical care unit, as well as 79% of the level 6 scores. There were no significant differences in the number of rapid responses between 2012 and 2013. Patients were then analyzed via chi square test in grouped distribution of scores of ≥5 and <5. Significant differences were seen in the total number of RRT interventions, the number of unplanned transfers and the number of RRTs within 24 hours. However, when looking at the grouping among patients with only RRT intervention, there was no significant difference between groups with a score ≥5 and those ≤4.\n\nConclusion: A patient acuity scale to quantify how likely a patient is to have an adverse event has been shown to correlate with rapid responses and transfers to a higher level of care within the first 24 hours. Patients who had an RRT intervention had a higher score overall with a trend toward increasing transfer rates with elevated scores. Using this scoring system did not lead to a lower amount of rapid responses in comparing years; however, it could be used for selective monitoring to prevent sentinel events.\n\n5 Hemoconcentration as a Marker of Decongestion in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure\n\nSaif Ibrahim, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Martin A. Cerda, DO; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Line Kemeyou, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Trevanne Matthew-Hews, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Joel Strom, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL\n\nBackground: Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalizations and death in developed countries. Effective decongestion may reduce intravascular volume leading to hemoconcentration, with improved survival. It is unknown whether hemoconcentration results in decreased rates of readmission and/or delayed times from discharge to readmission. We hypothesize that effective acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) treatment results in a measurable rise in hemoglobin/hematocrit that is associated with a reduced rate and/or delayed time to readmission rates.\n\nMethods: The study was a single-center, retrospective, nonrandomized study. Patients with an ejection fraction ≤40% and documented hemoglobin and hematocrit at the time of admission and discharge were analyzed. Excluded were patients with stage III chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <59 mL/min/m2) or acute blood loss/anemia requiring transfusion. Pearson chi square tests and multivariable logistic regression were fitted using univariable and multivariable models.\n\nResults: Of 399 patients screened, 121 patients (mean age 58.9 ± 14.1 years) met the inclusion criteria; 65% were male and 68% were nonwhite. Significant predictors of readmission in univariable analyses were admission use of beta blockers (P=0.042), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P=0.018), or diuretics (P=0.042); biventricular implantable cardioverter defibrillator (P=0.005); coronary artery disease (CAD) (P=0.020); and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (P=0.013). In those readmitted, there were no differences in any of the characteristics. In a multivariable model, only CAD (P=0.002), weight loss (P=0.008), and CVA (P=0.013) were significant predictors of readmission. ADHF conveys a poor prognosis for subsequent readmission.\n\nConclusion: Despite greater in-hospital weight loss and more intensive heart failure therapy, readmitted patients did not have evidence of hemoconcentration, suggesting that weight loss was perhaps because of extravascular fluid losses. CAD and CVA were shown to be predictors of readmission.\n\n6 Validation and Testing of a Novel Device to Improve Hand Hygiene\n\nJana Stockwell, MD; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Chris Hermann, PhD; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Lauren Derrigo, RN; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Bonnie Miller, RN; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Deb LaPorte, RN; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nBackground: Every year in the US, more than 2 million hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) result in more than 100,000 deaths. HAIs are now the leading cause of accidental death in the US and cost hospitals $10 billion each year. The single greatest way to prevent the spread of HAIs is to perform proper hand hygiene. By improving hand hygiene, hospitals can reduce the incidence of these infections by 40%-70%. Despite the overwhelming evidence, nearly all hospitals have compliance rates that remain below 50%. To address this need, we have developed and tested a simple, cost-effective device to monitor and remind providers to use the hand sanitizer.\n\nMethods: Under IRB approval, we installed hand hygiene devices in the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. The device uses an ultrasound-based proximity sensor to detect an individual entering or exiting a patient's room; if the sanitizer device was not utilized, the device played an audio recording saying “Please foam up.” The device recorded compliance for each patient interaction. Compliance data was validated using observers who compared hand hygiene events recorded by the device to the events observed. After the validation phase, the devices were activated in all 30 patient rooms, but the voice reminder was silenced for 6 weeks (=baseline compliance). The voice reminder was then turned on for a 6-week period and then resilenced in all patient rooms for another 5-week period. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc comparison with P<0.05 being considered significant. During the study, the hospital's traditional direct observation system was continued in the unit.\n\nResults: The observers spent a total of 700+ hours and recorded more than 2,800 patient interactions. During the validation phase, the devices detected 99.1% of the providers correctly, detected 97.9% of the sanitizer dispenses correctly, and the mean compliance was 32%. During the first silent phase, the mean compliance was 16% and there was no significant variation among the weeks. After turning the voice on, the compliance increased to 44% in the first week and continued to increase before reaching a consistent level at 60%. After resilencing the devices, the compliance decreased to 25% the following week and there was no statistical difference among the last 4 weeks of this phase compared to the first silent phase. Of note, the device was not set to distinguish isolation rooms, use of sanitizer outside of the patient room, or compliance by visitors and family.\n\nConclusion: The devices recorded hand hygiene events and sanitizer use accurately over the validation period. The results of the three phases clearly demonstrated that the introduction of the audio reminder led to a 400% improvement in compliance rates, which returned to baseline following the resilencing of the device. The results indicate that an audio reminder has the ability to dramatically improve hand hygiene compliance.\n\n7 Disease Characteristics, Patterns of Care, and Survival in Very Elderly Patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma\n\nJessica N. Williams, BS; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Ashish Rai, MBBS, MSPH; Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, Joseph Lipscomb, PhD; Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, Jean L. Koff, MD; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, Loretta J. Nastoupil, MD; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, Christopher R. Flowers, MD, MS; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA\n\nBackground: Despite having the highest incidence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), patients >80 years are rarely included in DLBCL clinical trials or epidemiologic studies. Although rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) are considered standard therapy for DLBCL, patterns of use and the impact of R-CHOP on survival in patients >80 years are less clear.\n\nMethods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to characterize presentation, treatment, and survival patterns in DLBCL patients diagnosed from 1999-2009. Chi square tests compared characteristics and initial treatments of DLBCL patients >80 years and 66-80 years. Multivariable logistic regression models examined factors associated with treatment selection in patients >80; standard and propensity score-adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazard models examined relationships between treatment regimen, treatment duration, and survival.\n\nResults: Among 5,924 patients with DLBCL, 1,422 (24%) were >80 years. Patients >80 years were less likely to receive R-CHOP and more likely to be observed or receive R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), both P<0.0001. Sex, marital status, area-level poverty, year of diagnosis, performance status, and disease site were associated with initial R-CHOP in patients >80. R-CHOP was associated with the longest overall survival (OS) in patients >80 of all stages, with R-CHOP for >4 cycles demonstrating the most favorable hazard ratio (HR) (0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.62). Among stage III/IV patients, R-CHOP for >4 cycles (HR 0.48, CI 0.31-0.72) and R-CVP for >4 cycles (HR 0.40, CI 0.21-0.76) demonstrated significantly longer OS.\n\nConclusion: Although DLBCL patients >80 years were less likely to receive R-CHOP, this regimen conferred the longest OS. In stage III/IV DLBCL, R-CVP can be considered as an alternative.\n\n8 Choice of Sedation and its Impact on Adenoma Detection Rate: Results from a Retrospective Study\n\nRahman Nakshabendi, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Bijo K. John, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Mourad Bashar, DO; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Juan Carlos Muñoz, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL\n\nBackground: The data regarding the performance of colonoscopy with regards to adenoma detection rate (ADR) using conscious sedation (CS) versus propofol sedation (PS) remain controversial. Our primary endpoint was to determine if there is a significant increase in ADR when using PS compared to CS.\n\nMethods: Using an electronic database, we retrospectively reviewed 750 consecutive patients who strictly underwent screening colonoscopies from July 2012 through May 2013. Fifty-one patients were excluded from the study because of incomplete demographic data. Of the remaining 699 patients, 391 underwent colonoscopy with CS, and 308 patients underwent colonoscopy with PS. CS was achieved with fentanyl and midazolam. PS was achieved with propofol administered by an anesthesiologist. Colonoscopies were performed by the same gastroenterology staff or by a gastrointestinal fellow. For purposes of the study, adenomas from the cecum to the distant transverse colon were defined as proximal, and adenomas from the descending colon at the splenic flexure to the rectum were defined as distal. Univariate analysis was performed to investigate the differences between sedation methods. Multivariable analyses with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test were employed to detect the difference in ADR between medication groups, adjusting for confounders.\n\nResults: Of the 699 colonoscopies, 270 were performed by the same gastrointestinal tract staff, 349 were performed by advanced trainees (second- and third-year fellows), and 80 were performed by first year fellows. There were 413 females and 286 males in the study. There was no significant difference in ADR, bowel preparation quality, gender, proximal adenoma detection, and terminal ileum intubation between medication groups. There was a significant difference in race between the two groups, with 67.3% black patients in the CS group and 53.6% in the PS group. More patients with private insurance were in the PS group. Median procedure time, time to cecal intubation, and procedure withdrawal time were of shorter duration in the patients receiving PS. The ADR for all providers was 33% for CS vs 36% for PS when adjusted for satisfactory bowel preparation.\n\nConclusion: The type of sedation during colonoscopy does not impact the ADR. Adjustments for patient demographics, trainee level, withdrawal time, total time taken, preparation quality, and tracheal intubation failed to show an overall advantage in detecting adenomas when using PS. A greater amount of time spent performing the colonoscopy detected more adenomas. In this era of rising healthcare costs, we can continue to reassure physicians and patients that CS and PS yield comparable results.\n\n9 Information Transfer at Hospital Discharge: A Contemporary Systematic Review (2007-2014)\n\nSharma Kattel, MBBS; Mayo Clinic Health System, Albert Lea, MN, Dennis M. Manning, MD; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, Patricia J. Erwin, MLS; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, Harrison Wood, MD; Mayo Clinic Health System, Albert Lea, MN, Deanne T. Kashiwagi, MD; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, Mohammad Hassan Murad, MD, MPH; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN\n\nBackground: Delayed, insufficient, or inaccurate transfer of information at the time of discharge between hospital-based and primary care providers (PCPs) can have a negative impact on patient care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the timeliness and quality of hospital discharge summaries, as well as interventions to improve the timeliness and quality of hospital discharge summaries.\n\nMethods: We searched PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus databases published in English between January 2007 and February 2014. We also hand searched bibliographies of relevant articles. In our analysis, we included observational studies investigating the transfer of information at hospital discharge (n=7) and controlled studies evaluating interventions to improve transfer, quality, and content of discharge information (n=12). Data were extracted on the availability, timeliness, and content of hospital discharge summaries. Data on the effectiveness of interventions were also extracted. Results of studies were combined and presented using a metanarrative approach.\n\nResults: Across the included studies, discharge summaries were completed within 48 hours in 67% of cases (range, 66%-98%) and were available to PCPs within 48 hours only 55% of the time. Most of the time, discharge summaries included demographic and administrative data, primary diagnosis, description of hospital course, and discharge instructions. However, information was limited on pending test results (25%), diagnostic tests performed (60%), and postdischarge medications (78%). In 6 of 7 interventional studies, the implementation of electronic discharge summaries was associated with improvement in the timeliness but not the quality of discharge summaries.\n\nConclusion: Delayed or insufficient transfer of discharge information between hospital-based providers and PCPs remains common. Creation of electronic discharge summaries may improve timeliness and availability of discharge summaries.\n\n10 PFTs: Worth Their Weight in GOLD?\n\nElliot Backer, MD; New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Wilmington, NC, Reunka Bhan, MD; New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Wilmington, NC\n\nBackground: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, represents a modifiable cause of mortality, morbidity, and healthcare expenditure. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) puts forth evidence-based treatment guidelines that rely on the use of pulmonary function tests (PFTs). In this study, we evaluated the use of PFTs, diagnostic accuracy, and degree of guideline-consistent COPD therapy in our outpatient residency clinic.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review of active patients with a preexisting diagnosis of COPD, restrictive lung disease, or asthma at New Hanover Regional Medical Center's Internal Medicine Outpatient Resident Clinic was performed. We evaluated several data points, including whether patients had a PFT and if their recorded diagnosis in our electronic medical record (EMR) was proven by PFT. If the diagnosis of COPD was confirmed, we compared their GOLD stage and medications with current guideline recommendations. Last, we looked at how many COPD exacerbations the patient had during the last year.\n\nResults: Of the 125 patients who met inclusion criteria for this study, 38% had documented PFT results in our EMR. Of the multiple variables evaluated, only body mass index was statistically significant: overweight patients (P<0.01) were more likely to have received a PFT. Some nonsignificant trends were observed: white patients (74%) (P=0.08), those with greater pack-year smoking histories (P=0.06), and individuals with private insurance (P=0.07) were more likely to have a PFT recorded. In patients who had a PFT, the documented diagnosis was correct 77% of the time. Of those with PFT-proven COPD, therapy was consistent with guideline recommendations 38% of the time.\n\nConclusion: Our study found that of patients with reported COPD, asthma, or restrictive lung disease, only a minority had a PFT performed. The majority of those with PFT-proven COPD were treated outside the current recommendations. Whether a PFT was performed did not influence whether COPD therapy was initiated, nor did it correlate with the observed rate of COPD exacerbations. Limitations of this study may include affordability and access to PFT and medications in our patient population. Other outcomes can be investigated to further characterize some of our observations, and more data are needed to determine the significance of the trends found. This study is now in its second phase in which we are working to reformat how PFTs are ordered and viewed in our EMR. By improving providers' ease of access to diagnostic testing and results, as well as implementing guideline-based checklists within our clinic notes, we hope to improve our care of the population with COPD.\n\n11 Controlling Atrial Fibrillation by Atrial Flutter Ablation in the Presence of Left Atrial Enlargement: A 10-Year Review\n\nSaif Ibrahim, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Jean Touchan, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Farah Al-saffar, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Steve Hsu, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Alian Aguila, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL\n\nBackground: Typical isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (AFL) is a macroreentrant supraventricular tachycardia in which reentrant rhythm is entirely located in the right atrium. Based on population studies, an estimated 200,000 new cases of AFL are diagnosed in the United States each year. The management of patients with AFL is costly and associated with the inherent risk of thromboembolic disease and stroke. Radiofrequency catheter ablation targeting the isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus is an established therapy for the treatment of AFL. This therapy in lone AFL is successful in 90% of patients, but the long-term management of patients with AFL is often complicated by new coexistent AFL or new incident arrhythmia, with a reported incidence of up to 50%. Few studies in the literature have investigated the benefit of AFL ablation on new incident atrial fibrillation (AF), time of onset, or arrhythmia burden after isthmus-dependent AFL radiofrequency ablation. Left atrial (LA) dilatation, however, has been a long-known cause for AF, and we attempted to examine the benefits of AFL ablation in reducing AF, taking LA dilatation into account.\n\nMethods: Medical records for patients seen between January 2003 and January 2013 who had isthmus-dependent AFL, had undergone radiofrequency ablation, and had dual-chamber pacemaker/defibrillator/loop recorder implanted at the time of index ablation or thereafter were included. Pregnant patients and those <18 years were excluded. Age, sex, history of smoking, and/or presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, or left ventricular dysfunction and previous stroke were summarized and analyzed. LA diameter was assessed at the time of ablation and at 12 months. Daily AF frequency before AFL ablation was extracted through device interrogation. AF delta (daily frequency before minus frequency after ablation) was the primary outcome. The correlation between these predictors and the outcome (AFL frequency per day) was tested using t test and generalized linear models.\n\nResults: After reviewing medical records, 80 patients were included. Of those, the data for preablation and postablation frequency of AFL was available for 17 patients. Mean AF per day before ablation was 23.15 (95% confidence interval -9.08, 55.37) and after ablation was 4.74 (-2.69, 12.16) (P=0.204). Data about LA diameter were available for 14 of the 17 patients (82.35%) and showed that 10 patients (71.42%) had dilated LA (>4 cm). Patients with normal LA diameter had stable AF delta (mean 0.01, standard deviation 0.156), while patients with dilated LA had a great increase in AF delta (mean +30.19, standard deviation 73.82) (P=0.425). Ten patients (58.82%) did not have diabetes (mean AF delta 7.52, standard deviation 27.05), while 7 (41.17%) were diabetic (mean AF delta 33.96, standard deviation 84.67) (P=0.351). Similarly, 7 patients did not have CAD (mean AF delta -1.11, standard deviation 4.59), and 10 had CAD (mean AF delta 32.08, standard deviation 72.89) (P=0.233).\n\nConclusion: AFL ablation showed a trend toward reducing AF burden in this sample of patients. This effect, however, did not achieve statistical significance. We noticed that most of those patients had concomitant LA dilation, which may have reduced the efficacy of AFL ablation. When focusing on arrhythmias as multifactorial as AF, clinicians may take into account controlling other factors, especially because coexisting pathologies like CAD, diabetes, and dilated LA can increase the odds of developing AF.\n\n12 Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy After Normal Delivery: A Literature Review\n\nFarah Al-saffar, MD, MPH; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Saif Ibrahim, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Abdulwahab Hritani, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Gladys Velarde, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL\n\nBackground: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), also known as broken heart syndrome or apical ballooning syndrome, has been well described in the literature. First described in 1990, the term TTC (referred to as myocardial stunning), was used to delineate temporary left ventricular ischemia without evidence of coronary artery disease. Many cases have been reported after cesarean deliveries, but no review has examined it after vaginal deliveries.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic literature review on TTC after normal vaginal delivery. PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched for the following terms in the titles: takatsubo, takotsubo, tako-tsubo, ballooning, stress-induced, transient cardiomyopathy + pregnant, pregnancy, postpartum, postpartal, puerperal, peripartum, and delivery.\n\nResults: Six articles were included in the review. Onset of TTC was anywhere between 1-40 days postpartum. Ventricular fibrillation was seen in 2 cases with elevated troponin levels in 3 reports. Ejection fraction ranged from 19%-45%, with apical hypokinesis and ballooning being the major echoradiologic findings. In 5 of 6 cases, the prognosis was excellent. The literature review suggested estrogen deficiency in the postpartum period as the underlying etiology.\n\nConclusion: Although TTC is usually reported after cesarean sections, we highlight that it can be seen after vaginal deliveries, too. Clinical suspicion is key when treating young female patients with no medical history that can account for their cardiac symptoms and who have ischemic electrocardiogram changes. While ejection fraction can be greatly depressed initially, patients show good prognosis with conservative treatment, and invasive intervention is rarely needed. One possible mechanism for TTC can be estrogen deficiency seen during and after delivery. Compared to the literature review done by Minatoguchi, it is noticeable how TTC after cesarean section tends to occur more rapidly as opposed to cases seen after vaginal delivery. This result may be attributable to the more frequent use of tocolytics in cesarean deliveries than in vaginal deliveries. It will be interesting to examine gravidity/parity status and modes of deliveries in prior pregnancies in future case reports. It is unclear, because of the few case reports available, whether pregnancy and delivery have a cumulative stressful effect on the female body, and whether this effect is modulated by prior modes of delivery and the spacing between pregnancies.\n\n13 Groove Pancreatitis\n\nAlexander Kim, DO; Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PA, Deepak Vedamurthy, MD; Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PA\n\nCase Presentation: A 42-year-old man with a significant history of alcohol abuse (a pint of vodka daily) for 30 years presented with a 2-week history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. He was hemodynamically stable when he presented, and his physical examination was only notable for epigastric tenderness to palpation. His laboratory results were unremarkable without leukocytosis or electrolyte abnormalities except for mild elevation in lipase at 77. An ultrasound of his abdomen revealed a complex, heterogeneously echogenic area with internal cystic features (5.8 cm) in the porta hepatis/peripancreatic region. A computed tomography scan was performed to further evaluate this complex cyst and showed mixed soft tissue/cystic masses in the pancreaticoduodenal groove. There was no evidence of pancreatic or biliary duct dilatation. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed a fibrous and cystic mass centered in the pancreaticoduodenal groove that was suggestive of groove pancreatitis. The patient was treated supportively with intravenous hydration and pain management. His symptoms improved without further intervention, and he tolerated a regular diet well at the time of discharge to inpatient alcohol rehabilitation.\n\nDiscussion: Groove pancreatitis is an extremely rare form of chronic pancreatitis that is found in the superior aspect of the pancreatic head, the duodenum, and the common bile duct. Only a few descriptions of its existence are in the radiology and pathology literature, and many radiologists remain unfamiliar with the entity even in the most specialized centers. It is also extraordinarily difficult to distinguish groove pancreatitis from malignancy solely based on imaging studies, likely because of unfamiliarity of the entity and lack of adequate distinctive imaging features between groove pancreatitis and malignancy. Many patients with this entity unnecessarily undergo a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) because of an inability to completely exclude malignancy.\n\nConclusion: Similar to traditional chronic pancreatitis, groove pancreatitis has strong association with alcohol abuse, and it is more common in middle-aged men. Patients generally present with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting as our patient did. However, patients may rarely present with acute gastric outlet obstruction. The prospective diagnosis of groove pancreatitis is difficult regardless of the radiologic modality. Groove pancreatitis is an important diagnostic consideration for any pancreatic cystic lesion, especially when it involves the duodenal wall. The pathogenesis remains largely unclear, but disturbed outflow of the Santorini duct because of chronic alcohol toxicity is a commonly regarded causative factor. Because of its rarity and difficulty distinguishing from malignancy, physicians need to be more aware of this entity when evaluating cystic pancreatic lesions. More studies are needed to find a way to differentiate groove pancreatitis and malignancy in a noninvasive way, and physicians should be more familiar with its radiographic features to avoid unnecessary aggressive procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n14 Pituitary Origin of Cirrhosis––A Surprising Link\n\nAnastasia-Stefania Alexopoulos, MD; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Roshan Patel, MD; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Rumman Langah, MD; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 19-year-old African American male presented with progressive shortness of breath over 1 month. Associated symptoms were dry cough and 40-lb weight loss. Medical history was pertinent for meningitis 4 years ago without any residual deficits. Vital signs were temperature 37°C, heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 93/35 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on 4 L. Examination revealed fish-mouth deformity, hypertelorism, marfanoid features, loss of secondary sexual characteristics, microorchidism, and II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Abnormal laboratory data included alanine transaminase 42, aspartate aminotransferase 96, alkaline phosphatase 125, and international normalized ratio 1.86. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed hepatic steatosis with associated perfusion abnormalities and absent testes. Subsequent liver biopsy showed severe steatosis accompanied by bridging fibrosis and nodule formation. As clinically suspected, intrapulmonary shunting was evidenced by a positive bubble study on echocardiogram, further confirmed by a 70% intrapulmonary shunt seen on pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy. Other important tests were undetectable testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and insulin-like growth factor 1 and a failed cosyntropin stimulation test. In light of these findings, a brain MRI was ordered that revealed a pituitary mass, and consequent biopsy showed fibrous tissue only. Our final diagnosis was hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) secondary to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the cause of which remains unclear but is likely linked to panhypopituitarism. No overarching genetic diagnosis has yet been identified on genetic testing. The patient was discharged home on hormone replacement therapy and oxygen supplementation, while undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation.\n\nDiscussion: The link between hypopituitarism and the development of NAFLD is becoming increasingly recognized, although it is not well understood. Furthermore, a few case reports suggest that HPS may actually occur at an increased frequency in patients with hypopituitarism. This case adds to the sparse literature supporting an interrelated pathogenesis of these conditions. Further studies are required to explore the link between the pituitary gland and liver and hence improve our understanding of how to manage these patients.\n\nConclusion: With the increasing prevalence of NAFLD alongside obesity in the United States, it is important to be aware of the link between hypopituitarism and NAFLD, particularly because these patients may have a higher likelihood of developing cirrhosis complicated by hepatopulmonary syndrome.\n\n15 Sudden Loss of Vision After Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram\n\nMohamad Moussa, MD, FHM; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 20-year-old white female was seen in the emergency room at Emory Johns Creek Hospital in late June 2014 for epigastric abdominal pain lasting 7 days that was worsening. Computed tomography revealed cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The patient's medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and tonsillectomy as a child. The patient had laparoscopic cholecystectomy the day of admission that she tolerated well. The second day, she was still having abdominal pain and was seen by a gastrointestinal tract physician who performed an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) with no noted obstruction. Immediately after recovering from ERCP, the patient started to have blurred vision that worsened, leading to almost complete blindness the second morning. Her lipase dramatically increased, reflecting acute pancreatitis. Surgery consulted the hospital medicine service for the loss of vision, and we consulted the ophthalmologist on call and ordered brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ophthalmologist was concerned about Purtscher retinopathy, a rare condition that usually develops after pancreatitis and is an immune complex–mediated phenomenon that leads to damage of the retinal artery. Eye slit examination revealed disc edema with mild hemorrhage, and the patient was only able to see shades of black and white. Brain and orbit MRI/magnetic resonance angiography showed abnormal brain stem and bilateral edema of basal ganglia, inferior thalami, and hippocampi, with findings most suspicious for toxic metabolic event vs herpetic encephalitis. The patient underwent urgent lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy with cerebrospinal fluid culture, oligoclonal bands testing and blood anticardiolipin, lupus-sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time, and Anti-B2GP1 immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M. All tests were negative. The patient was immediately administered intravenous acyclovir and Solu-Medrol and was seen by the staff neurologist who diagnosed acute diffuse encephalomyelitis. The patient started intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. She had a repeat ERCP and abdominal MRI with improvement of her abdominal pain and resolution of her pancreatitis. Her visual loss improved slowly, but she was discharged home after prolonged hospitalization, still with significant visual impairment. Close follow-up with neurology and ophthalmology was scheduled.\n\n16 Pseudohypercalcemia Multiple Myeloma: Important Inpatient Treatment Implication\n\nBindiya G. Patel; University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, Martin Giangreco, MD; University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, Jorge Lamarche, MD; University of South Florida, Tampa, FL\n\nCase Presentation: A 75-year-old African American male with refractory immunoglobulin G-κ multiple myeloma progressive through 3 regimens of chemotherapy (5 bortezomib cycles, 10 lenalidomide cycles, 5 cyclophosphamide/bortezomib cycles, and currently on a pomalidomide cycle) and a medical history of iatrogenic anterior uveitis/scleritis from bisphosphonate treatment presented to the emergency room from the oncology clinic with hypercalcemia. He denied any attributable symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, confusion, nephrolithiasis, polyuria, nocturia, weakness, or bone pain. Serum calcium measured 12.8 mg/dL, and corrected serum calcium was 13.8 mg/dL (albumin of 2.8 g/dL). Other laboratory values were within normal range. Intravenous hydration with normal saline solution was started, with bisphosphonate treatment deferred because of adverse reactions to pamidronate and zoledronic acid. After several days, the patient's serum calcium was not responsive to fluid therapy or subcutaneous calcitonin treatment. For this reason, serum calcium and ionized calcium were obtained concomitantly with serum calcium of 12.0 mg/dL and ionized calcium of 0.90 mmol/L, leading to the diagnosis of pseudohypercalcemia.\n\nDiscussion: Pseudohypercalcemia is defined as persistent elevation of total serum calcium concentration in the presence of normal ionized serum calcium levels. Normally, 50% of soluble calcium is ionized, and 50% is bound to albumin. Multiple myeloma can induce pseudohypercalcemia by a monoclonal myeloma protein binding to calcium. Studies have shown that the binding site for calcium is in the Fab part of the molecule. Hazani et al theorized that the immunoglobulin G binds to excess calcium and protects the patient from the hypercalcemic effects of polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, and confusion. As many as 4 moles of calcium binding to 1 mole of immunoglobulin G have been reported in a quantitative study by Merlini et al. Evidence has not shown significant calcium binding to occur with normal immunoglobulins or with immunoglobulins in polyclonal gammopathies (ie, liver disease, connective tissue disease, and chronic infection). Pseudohypercalcemia has been described in immunoglobulin G-κ of Waldenström macroglobulinemia, immunoglobulin G-κ, immunoglobulin G-λ, and immunoglobulin G-κ paraproteins disorders. Interestingly, a study has shown that in an elevated protein state, hyperviscosity can interfere with calcium measurement by an autoanalyzer. Binding of myeloma immunoglobulin to copper and flavin has also been described.\n\nConclusion: This case illustrates that in an asymptomatic patient, suspicion of pseudohypercalcemia in a state of elevated proteins should be considered to avoid unnecessary treatment. In every myeloma patient with hypercalcemia but no symptoms to suggest manifestations of derangement, concomitant measurement of serum calcium and ionized calcium should be tested before starting treatment. Deproteinization of the sample before calcium and phosphate measurement to obtain comparable results has been suggested. Inpatient treatment with high volume intravenous fluids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin is not indicated to treat pseudohypercalcemia and should be avoided to prevent unnecessary side effects of medications. Treatment of the myeloma itself to reduce immunoglobulin levels is the preferred method of normalizing calcium levels.\n\n17 Herpes Zoster Oticus (Ramsay Hunt Syndrome) Associated with Meningoencephalitis in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus–Infected Patient\n\nMichel T. Corban, MD; Department of Internal Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Jorge L. Salinas, MD; Department of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Bhavin Adhyaru, MD; Department of Internal Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Molly Eaton, MD; Department of Internal Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 50-year-old African American woman with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [cluster of differentiation 4 count 69 cells/mm3] off antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the time and thoracic herpes zoster presented after 1 week of painful left ear vesicles in the auditory canal. Two days prior to admission, she developed left facial droop, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, ataxia, fever, chills, and progressive confusion. The patient was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) (herpes zoster oticus and ipsilateral facial nerve paralysis) and started on intravenous acyclovir, systemic steroids, and resumption of ART. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) was consistent with meningoencephalitis (352 RBC, 903 WBC, 242 mg/dL protein, and 39 mg/dL glucose) with positive CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and negative CSF bacterial cultures. The left ear vesicles and erythema improved after 48 hours of treatment with resolution of confusion.\n\nDiscussion: First described by James Ramsay Hunt, an American neurologist, RHS (peripheral facial nerve palsy accompanied by an erythematous vesicular rash on the ear) is a rare but severe complication of VZV reactivation in the geniculate ganglion. Treatment with acyclovir and prednisone within 3 days of onset has been associated with complete recovery from facial paralysis in about 75% of cases. RHS is uncommonly associated with meningoencephalitis, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of RHS associated with CSF PCR-confirmed VZV meningoencephalitis in a patient with HIV. The sensitivity/specificity of this PCR-based method for detecting VZV DNA is reported to be more than 95% in VZV meningoencephalitis. It has been reported that VZV accounts for approximately 2% of central nervous system infections in the general population vs 7% in the HIV-infected population.\n\nConclusion: VZV meningoencephalitis associated with RHS should be suspected and treated with intravenous acyclovir and systemic steroids in any patient presenting with herpes zoster oticus, ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, and altered mental status. In addition, ART should also be started in patients with HIV.\n\n18 A Rare Disease on the Rise: Neurosyphilis\n\nScott Graupner, DO; Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, Andrew Glover, MD; Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 35-year-old white male with no significant medical history presented after 4 days of blurry vision in his left eye with associated pain, injection, miosis, and left-sided headache. Further history revealed that 10 months prior, he tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis and was treated with penicillin but developed a rash and was switched to doxycycline. He had also noted a painless penile lesion 1 month prior. Initial ophthalmic examination was significant for a right dilated pupil that was reactive to light and a left pupil that was constricted, injected, and nonreactive to light. Further ophthalmic examination revealed panuveitis of the left eye. The rest of the physical examination was significant for pustules on the palmar surface of the hands and bilateral, diffuse lymphadenopathy in the cervical, epitrochlear, and inguinal regions. Initial laboratory findings included a positive serum rapid plasma reagin test. The patient was admitted for presumed neurosyphilis with penicillin allergy. He was administered oral prednisone as well as Prednefrin Forte and atropine eye drops for his uveitis. Lumbar puncture and computed tomography of the head were also obtained on admission. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit on the second day of admission for desensitization to penicillin. He was desensitized using serial dilutions of increasing levels of penicillin administered with intravenous diphenhydramine and steroids. After the desensitization protocol and monitoring, the patient was administered continuous penicillin G infusion. The VDRL from cerebrospinal fluid test came back positive at a 1:2 ratio. The patient was discharged when stable with a 14-day course of intravenous penicillin G, followed by oral penicillin VK daily, and 3 weekly Bicillin injections with close infectious disease follow-up.\n\nDiscussion: Neurosyphilis is a once common disease that was nearly erased after the introduction of antibiotics but is rising with the coexistent increase in syphilis rates. Recognizing the disease is important, especially in HIV patients, in whom neurosyphilis can manifest itself much earlier from time of onset. The rates of primary syphilis infection from Treponema pallidum have been increasing during the past 15 years. Neurosyphilis, unlike other stages of syphilis, may occur at any time during the course of infection and may occur much more rapidly in HIV-positive patients. It is also important to identify ophthalmic findings in patients with syphilis, including optic neuritis, iritis, uveitis, and Argyll Robertson pupil in which the affected pupil accommodates light but does not react.\n\nConclusion: In patients with neurosyphilis, penicillin G intravenously is the standard of care, and patients with penicillin allergy must be desensitized with appropriate safety. One must watch for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in which a syndrome of fever/chills, myalgia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment. Obtaining a thorough history along with recognizing systemic and ophthalmic findings can be important in diagnosing and appropriately treating a patient with neurosyphilis.\n\n19 Tissue Plasminogen Activator Myocardial Infarction Paradox: Acute Coronary Syndrome After Ischemic Cerebral Vascular Accident Treated with Thrombolytic Therapy\n\nAmer Sayed, MD; Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, Gyanendra Sharma, MD; Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol dependency presented with sudden right side weakness and aphasia lasting one-half hour. She denied having chest pain or dyspnea. On physical examination, she was in mild distress with right motor and sensory deficits along with aphasia. Her blood pressure was 180/90 mmHg. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal sinus with no ischemic changes. Computed tomography scan of the head did not show intracranial hemorrhage, and within 1 hour of the symptoms, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered for potential left middle cerebral artery stroke. A few hours later, she became tachypneic and tachycardiac. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary congestion. Troponin I was elevated to 38, and ECG showed inferolateral ST segment depression. Blood pressure was at the lower normal limits. Bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis and inferior akinesis with ejection fraction of 30% but no thrombus in the left ventricle. Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction was then diagnosed. Atorvastatin was started, but aspirin was held because of the stroke, as were beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors because of relative hypotension. Three days later, left heart catheterization (delayed because of the recent tPA use) showed multivessel coronary artery disease with left main 95% and left anterior descending 70% stenosis along with total occlusion of the right coronary artery with collateral perfusion. Troponin I was trending down, and the patient's weakness improved. Coronary artery bypass grafting was high risk at that time because of the comorbidities and intermittent altered mental status; therefore, it was deferred for later evaluation. Medical therapy was initiated after a few days as indicated with heparin drip, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, high-dose statins, and aspirin, along with gentle diuresis for the new ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient's hospital course was complicated with urinary tract infection, possible septic shock with multiorgan failure, and Wernicke encephalopathy, all of which were treated appropriately. The patient did not have any recurrent cardiac symptoms and was discharged to an out-patient hospice.\n\nDiscussion: Thrombolytic therapy is indicated in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. However, although rare, administration of tPA may initiate acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This case represents an unusual case of acute myocardial infarction after tPA administration for acute ischemic stroke. A few mechanisms are suggested: first, thromboembolic mechanism from tPA-related intracardiac thrombus breakdown; second, plaque instability in the coronary arteries from the tPA effect causing plaque rupture and ACS. Echocardiogram can show intracardiac thrombus and differentiate the two. In this case, the acute myocardial infarction occurred just after the tPA administration, and echocardiogram did not show thrombus, making plaque instability and rupture the most likely cause. Our review of the literature shows only a few case reports with similar presentation.\n\nConclusion: Plaque instability and thromboembolic mechanism are rare but serious cardiac complications after tPA administration. Plaque stability is influenced by systemic factors that are present in a proportion of patients. Some individuals are more prone to rupture of plaques than others. Irregular plaques are usually a sign of instability and increased risk of rupture. Administration of tPA may contribute to plaque instability. Awareness of this rare complication can help physicians to diagnose this condition early and impact the management and outcome.\n\n20 A Pain in the Glutes\n\nSamreen Tariq, MBBS; Bayonne Medical Center, Bayonne, NJ, Joseph Smith, MD; Bayonne Medical Center, Bayonne, NJ, Richard Williams, MD; Bayonne Medical Center, Bayonne, NJ, Peter Smith, MD; Bayonne Medical Center, Bayonne, NJ, Hammad Choudhry, MD; Bayonne Medical Center, Bayonne, NJ\n\nCase Presentation: A 39-year-old white male with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted to the hospital because of altered mental status and auditory hallucinations. Initial workup revealed leukocytosis, respiratory acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and elevated liver function tests. In spite of aggressive resuscitation efforts, the patient went into renal failure requiring dialysis. A urine drug screen indicated cocaine, opiate, and barbiturate use. As his mental status improved, he started to complain of severe persistent pain in the left buttock area that required narcotics for pain relief. The physical examination showed marked swelling and difficulty in abduction and adduction of his left leg. Computed tomography scan revealed severe inflammation of the left gluteus medius and minimus muscles that further supported the diagnosis of gluteal compartment syndrome. Without further delay, emergent fasciotomy was performed.\n\nDiscussion: Gluteal compartment syndrome is a rare, often unrecognized syndrome that may manifest as renal failure, sepsis, and death. Delay in diagnosis can result in significant morbidity and possible mortality. The gluteal region has 3 osseofascial compartments: the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius/minimus, and the tensor fasciae latae. Because no major blood vessels or nerves lie in this area, the only physical finding is tense swelling of the gluteal region in a patient with altered mental status. The sciatic nerve, however, is susceptible to compression-induced neuropathy in the later stages because it lies posterior to the gluteus maximus beneath the external rotators of the hip. A fasciotomy should be performed as soon as possible to halt the ongoing ischemia and pending necrosis of viable tissue, along with prevention of further serious systemic side effects.\n\nConclusion: Because of its anatomic location, typical clinical features of compartment syndrome may not be evident. It can also be overlooked when psychiatric emergencies are the initial diagnosis, as this condition is common in cases of altered mental status and drug abuse. These patients may stay in one position for a prolonged period of time, leading to muscle damage, edema, and finally compartment syndrome. A high index of suspicion is required, especially in patients with altered mental status or sudden severe swelling and pain in the gluteal region, to prevent morbidity and mortality.\n\n21 Now You See It, Now You Don't—The Disappearing Lymphoma\n\nRahul Singh, MD; New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Wilmington, NC; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Edward Taylor, MD; New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Wilmington, NC; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 28-year-old Hispanic male with no reported medical history presented with a chief complaint of abdominal pain for 1 week associated with abdominal distention and constipation. The patient denied any weight loss, night sweats, chills, change in appetite, nausea, vomiting, or melena. He had no history of previous colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). No significant family history, tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use were reported. His vital signs were stable. The initial physical examination was remarkable for mildly tender abdomen in the right upper quadrant and moderate distension without a palpable liver edge or spleen. No lymphadenopathy was noted. Emergency room computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis revealed extensive omental nodularity and thickening with ascites. CT of the chest showed a calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe. Paracentesis was performed, yielding a serum-ascites albumin gradient of 0.2, total protein of 3.9, cell count of 2,540 with 3% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 79% lymphs, negative cytology/culture, and no organisms on acid-fast bacilli test. Acute hepatitis panel, human immunodeficiency virus test, thyroid stimulating hormone and purified protein derivative/QuantiFERON were negative. EGD and enteroscopy were unrevealing. Flow cytometry on the ascitic fluid yielded a 3% monoclonal population of B cells suggestive of large B-cell lymphoma. Ileocolonoscopy showed an area of thick nodular folds and an ulcer. Biopsy of this site revealed CD 20/10 strongly positive, CD 3/5/23/30 negative, B-cell lymphoma 2 weakly positive, Ki-67 positive in >90% of cells, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase negative. Pathology slides had a starry sky appearance but were negative for rearrangement of the Myc gene and MYC/IGH translocation t(8;14). The patient's diagnosis was high grade B-cell lymphoma, unclassified. He was discharged to Ben Taub Hospital in Houston, where he received extensive workup of his lymphoma, and no disease was found. The ileocolonoscopy, bone marrow biopsy, and positron emission tomography scan were all negative.\n\nDiscussion: According to the 4th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues in 2008, a new category of B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable was created. This category was established because of cases of intermediate features between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). This case presents a unique presentation of DLBCL with an unexplained disappearance of the disease. It also epitomizes the importance of keeping a broad differential when practicing hospital medicine.\n\nConclusion: In hospital medicine, the identification and coordination of care are vital aspects of practice. It is exceedingly rare to identify a DLBCL with BL characteristics, but disappearance of the lymphoma without treatment has not been reported in the literature. Based on the expression profiling of Ki-67 staining in >90% of the cells, weakly positive BCL-2, and the morphologic features, not treating the patient would be unfavorable. The classification of the tumor is important given the difference in treatment of DLBCL and BL. Despite no disease or activity being noted, this patient warrants treatment given the high risk of proliferation.\n\n22 Galloping Gammopathies\n\nJohn L. Elliott Jr., MD; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Jennifer Bracey, MD; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 64-year-old African American woman presented with shortness of breath, cough, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling that began several months prior. Her symptoms had become much worse during the past week and prevented her from performing some daily activities. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. All were being treated appropriately. The patient's blood pressure was 98/65 mmHg, her pulse was 115 bpm, and her respiratory rate was 18 with 96% O2 saturation on room air. Physical examination revealed an anasarcic-appearing woman with 3+ edema to her umbilicus, jugular venous distention of the neck, several 0.5 cm papules on her forehead, tachycardia with a prominent S3, prominent inspiratory crackles bilaterally with decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion at the lung bases, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory results showed hemoglobin of 7.1, white blood cell count of 6.5, sodium of 128, potassium of 3.9, chloride of 91, anion gap of 6, blood urea nitrogen of 18, and creatinine of 0.7. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was admitted for suspected congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Because standard CHF treatment did not provide relief, a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis revealed a triglyceride count of 256, diagnostic of a chylothorax, and a previous complete blood count was found to have rouleaux. On further examination, the papules were shown to be B-cell cluster of differentiation 20+ lymphoma infiltrating the dermis. The patient also admitted to substantial weight loss in the past year. A lymph node biopsy was performed, and treatment for Waldenström macroglobulinemia was initiated.\n\nDiscussion: Monoclonal gammopathies are categorized as light chain, heavy chain, or whole immunoglobulins, although many diseases may produce a combination of chain types. Whole immunoglobulin gammopathies are often seen with multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Waldenström is a rare disease with fewer than 1,500 cases occurring each year in the United States. The paraproteins of Waldenström are known to aggregate and increase blood viscosity, often leading to chronic heart failure symptoms from expanded blood volume, as well as neuropathies, skin papules, and chylothoraces from destruction of lymphatic vessels. Hepatomegaly is present in about 20% of cases. Advanced cases can prove difficult to treat, as the insidious nature of the disease can deplete a patient's physiologic reserves, as was the case with our patient. Initiation of chemotherapy in patients with a high disease burden can lead to tumor lysis syndrome that must be prepared for. Destruction of lymphatic vessels leading to chylothoraces are rare but must be treated rapidly. A dietitian is needed to assess the patient's nutritional status and create a diet low in triglycerides to reduce the buildup of chylous fluid. In advanced cases such as this, the 5-year survival rate is <36%.\n\nConclusion: Hyperviscotic states originating from gammopathies can mimic signs and symptoms of CHF and should be considered when patients do not respond to appropriate treatment or when patients present with atypical symptoms.\n\n23 Tuberculosis Masquerading as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis\n\nAnna Huguenard, BA, BS; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 76-year-old man with a history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) presented with complaints of weakness, fatigue, and poor oral intake. He had visited the emergency department a week prior for similar symptoms and required fluid resuscitation. During presentation, he denied any fevers or chills, cough, shortness of breath, headache, or neck stiffness. Earlier that month, the patient had been admitted for a presumed GPA flare, including fevers, cough, dyspnea, and x-ray evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. He was discharged on a higher dose of prednisone in addition to rituximab doses. He reported living at home with his wife whom he cares for and denied any sick contacts apart from his history of multiple hospital admissions during the past 6 months. During examination, he had diffuse crackles with inspiration and a uvular lesion believed to be because of his GPA. His hospital course was complicated by a decline to delirium on day 1. Chest x-ray showed cavitary mass-like consolidations in the left upper lobe, in the left lower lobe, and in the right upper lobe that were stable from prior admission imaging. Differential diagnosis narrowed to a flare of his vasculitis vs hospital- or community-acquired pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 30 mg intravenously twice daily were started. A transbronchial biopsy on hospital day 2 revealed multiple acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Both AFB and Grocott's methenamine silver stains were negative for fungi, pneumocystis, and mycobacteria. The histopathologic findings, however, did not resemble the previous biopsy taken a few months earlier. The patient stabilized and was discharged to subacute rehabilitation on antibiotics and continued steroids. A couple of weeks later, the patient was readmitted for altered status following a fall. During that admission, cultures from the original bronchoscopy returned positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and a history of childhood exposure to several family members who died from tuberculosis was discovered. Following profound side effects from rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol therapy, the patient opted to withdraw aggressive care and died shortly after.\n\nDiscussion: Abnormal results from chest imaging in a hospitalized patient can prompt an extensive differential diagnosis, but patient medical history may lead clinicians to narrow that differential too quickly. In the setting of known prior lung disease, due vigilance must be paid to other etiologies. Specifically, pathologies like tuberculosis necessitate aggressive treatment both for the patient and for public health. Our patient had risk factors for tuberculosis, most notable for chronic immunosuppression from medical management of his disease. While previous imaging demonstrated his vasculitis, his decline in functional and mental status should have prompted high suspicion for a comorbid condition. Appropriately digging deeper into the patient's family history would have further heightened suspicion for a reactivation of latent tuberculosis.\n\nConclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of being thorough and exhaustive in the creation and evaluation of the differential diagnosis in the face of a known history of lung disease. Caution should be demonstrated until tuberculosis can be effectively ruled out.\n\n24 Inflammation to Infarction—An Overlooked Link\n\nEva Raphael, MPH; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, Rumman Langah, MD; Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 74-year-old man presented with left-sided abdominal pain. Pertinent history included biopsy-proven eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) complicated with mesenteric ischemia during the last admission, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage III chronic kidney disease, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Vital signs were temperature 40.2°C, blood pressure 106/53 mmHg, heart rate 104 bpm, respiratory rate 18, and SpO2 93% on room air. Examination revealed left abdominal and costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory findings were hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 6.7 × 109/L with 34% eosinophils, lactate dehydrogenase 521 units/L, blood urea nitrogen 27 mg/dL, creatinine 3.87 mg/dL (baseline 2.0), unremarkable urinalysis, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 1, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 77 mm/h, C-reactive protein 70.87 mg/L, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) <1:20 (negative), C3 of 73 (low), C4 of 15 (normal), and rheumatoid factor 115 IU/mL. Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, chest x-ray, and blood and urine culture tests were negative. Computed tomography of the abdomen was unrevealing. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed multiple large cortical defects in the right kidney. In the absence of urinary infection, this finding represented renal infarcts. Renal biopsy showed scattered immune deposits, vascular inflammation and thickening, and thrombotic microangiopathy-type glomerular changes (endothelial injury and subendothelial widening on electron microscopy) consistent with an immune-mediated injury. In the face of ongoing abdominal pain, eosinophilia, evidence of renal infarction, biopsy findings, and known EGPA, the final diagnosis was EGPA flare complicated with focal vascular thrombosis resulting in renal infarction. This diagnosis was further strengthened by the fact that the patient's pain, eosinophil count, and renal function (creatinine peaked at 4.19 mg/dL and was 2.8 mg/dL on discharge) improved with steroid therapy (1 mg/kg/day). The patient was discharged with close nephrology follow-up.\n\nDiscussion: Abdominal pain of unclear etiology is a common admitting diagnosis for hospitalists; however, it is extremely uncommon to find renal infarction as an underlying cause. This case highlights a rare complication of EGPA. Other unusual EGPA complications range from thrombotic gallbladder necrosis to cerebrovascular accidents. EGPA is a systemic small- and medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis that typically presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and extravascular eosinophilic granulomas. Renal complications affect one-fifth of patients with EGPA and present as glomerulonephrotic/nephritic syndromes, but renal infarction is rare (1 case reported). ANCA positivity, in particular myeloperoxidase antibody, has been associated with a higher prevalence of renal involvement. Our patient further represents an extremely small pool of ANCA-negative EGPA patients with renal involvement. On further review of the patient's history and available laboratory records, EGPA is deemed a likely culprit for his recent history of mesenteric ischemia, nonischemic cardiomyopathy (possibly eosinophilic myocarditis), and cerebrovascular accident (small pontine infarct). Steroid therapy is the mainstay therapy for active disease or flares, along with immunosuppressive treatment depending on the degree and type of organ involvement. Prognosis is poor with multiorgan disease.\n\nConclusion: Small to medium vessel vasculitides, such as EGPA, can lead to organ infarct that can present simply as regional pain.\n\n25 Legionella micdadei—An Unsuspecting Cause of Necrotizing Pneumonia\n\nRobert Ali, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Candice Baldeo, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, James Cury, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL\n\nCase Presentation: A 59-year-old African American female with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (CD4 count 278), hepatitis C, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease with a drug-eluting stent in the right coronary artery presented with a productive cough, dyspnea, and fever for 3 days. She had a leukocytosis of 19.1 × 103/L and a chest x-ray showing opacification in the right midlung zone, concerning for pneumonia. She was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin but deteriorated 3 days later, becoming altered and hypoxic and requiring intubation. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed dense consolidative changes involving the right middle lobe and areas of the right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia, with central areas of hypodensity representing developing necrosis. Bronchoscopy showed abundant purulent secretions and inflamed mucosa. Antibiotics were escalated to vancomycin/Zosyn/Bactrim. She continued to deteriorate, requiring pressor support, and had worsening gas exchange. Serial chest x-rays were suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on the right necrotizing pneumonia. Antibiotics were revised, replacing Zosyn with meropenem. Repeat bronchoscopy only showed minimal secretions. Legionella culture from the initial bronchoalveolar lavage resulted nearly 1 month later and was positive for Legionella micdadei. Levofloxacin was started, to complete 4 weeks of therapy. Despite this treatment, the patient had a protracted ICU course complicated by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and candiduria. She required a short stint of epoprostenol infusion and eventually required tracheostomy with a prolonged ventilator wean. Repeat CT scan 3 months later revealed persistence of the right cavitary lesion, but with reduction in size and improvement of the consolidative process.\n\nDiscussion: Legionella micdadei is the second most common cause of legionellosis, accounting for 8% of cases. It causes pneumonia principally in immunosuppressed patients, with about 10% cavitating. Diagnosis is difficult because the organism stains only weakly Gram negative, requires special culture media, and is not detectable with some direct fluorescent antibody tests that are directed only at Legionella pneumophila. Furthermore, because it can stain acid fast, it may be confused with mycobacteria.\n\nConclusion: Patients diagnosed with HIV are often infected by more than one pathogen at a time; therefore, lack of response to therapy for one organism must trigger a search for additional pathogens. Culture using buffered charcoal yeast extract media remains the most sensitive and specific test for Legionnaires' disease, but acute and convalescent antibody titers can also be useful to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n26 Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura—Truly a Diagnosis of Exclusion\n\nRobert Ali, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Candice Baldeo, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Fauzia Rana, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL\n\nCase Presentation: A 69-year-old white male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with generalized abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, and rash for 2 days. He had been camping at Lake George 1 month prior but denied noticing any bites. He admitted to occasional cocaine use, frequent alcohol consumption with occasional binges, and ingestion of moonshine 2 days prior. He was altered, hypothermic, and actively hemorrhaging from the eyes and external urethral meatus. A petechial rash was noted over his lower limbs. He had diffuse abdominal tenderness but no organomegaly. Laboratory workup revealed isolated thrombocytopenia: hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL, white cell blood count 5.8 × 103/mm3, and platelets 6 × 103/mm3. Prothrombin time and international normalized ratio were mildly elevated, but partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, d-dimer, bilirubin, and haptoglobin were normal. Lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated. Blood film was negative for schistocytes. Reticulocyte count was 1.5%, and immature platelet fraction was 10.2%. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were elevated with a ratio <20, but no baseline was available for comparison. The patient had lactic acidosis with wide anion and osmolar gaps. Toxicology was positive only for opiates. Ultrasound was negative for hepatosplenomegaly. Serology was positive for antinuclear antibodies (1:180, speckled pattern) and perinuclear neutrophil antibodies. Hepatitis panel and human immunodeficiency virus screening were negative. Bone marrow biopsy was not performed. He received a partial massive transfusion: 2 units packed red blood cells, 7 units fresh frozen plasma, 4 units platelets, and 1 dose DDAVP (desmopressin). Empiric antibiotic coverage was commenced with vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. He underwent initial plasmapheresis and then dialysis. Platelet counts initially improved to 23 × 103/mm3 but dropped to 13 × 103/mm3. A one-time dose of methylprednisolone prompted a response, an increase to 77 × 103/mm3, but platelet counts began plummeting again when no subsequent doses were given and reached a nadir of 14 × 103/mm3. Platelets were again transfused, but high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin were commenced at scheduled doses to complete 3 days of therapy. He was subsequently transitioned to oral prednisone, achieving a sustained increase in platelet count to 115 × 103/mm3 on discharge.\n\nDiscussion: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by an isolated thrombocytopenia of <100 × 109/L after exclusion of other causes for a low platelet count. Primary disease arises in the absence of other causes, whereas secondary ITP occurs as a result of an offending infection, agent, or disease.\n\nConclusion: For any given state, platelet metabolism is directly influenced by the equilibrium between platelet production in the bone marrow and peripheral platelet destruction/sequestration. Furthermore, management of the underlying etiology will prompt an improvement of thrombocytopenia.\n\n27 Dyspnea on Exertion in an Otherwise Healthy Male\n\nCandice Baldeo, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Robert Ali, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Roshan Lala, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Abubakr Bajwa, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL\n\nCase Presentation: A 49-year-old African American male presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion (DOE) for the past year. He previously enjoyed an active lifestyle playing golf and basketball. His DOE limited daily activities but resolved with rest. He had no pertinent medical history and took no medications. The patient's vital signs and cardiopulmonary examination were normal. His prior workup included normal computed tomography chest and pulmonary function tests. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing revealed a high heart rate reserve but paradoxical bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 bpm with increasing workload. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a 3:1 Mobitz type II heart block at peak activity with resolution at rest to a baseline normal sinus rhythm of 60 bpm with right bundle branch block. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 41% and no infiltrative process. A dual chamber pacemaker was implanted, resulting in immediate improvement of the patient's symptoms.\n\nDiscussion: Most patients with dyspnea can be categorized into either a cardiac- or respiratory system-related cause. Exercise-induced atrioventricular (AV) block is rare in patients who exhibit normal AV conduction at rest (0.45%). Two mechanisms have been proposed. First, normal conduction velocity increases through vagolysis, and the refractory period decreases at the AV node. However, because the His-Purkinje system is not influenced by the autonomic nervous system, the refractory period is not significantly decreased. This difference in refractoriness between the AV node and the His-Purkinje system can induce conduction disturbances. Most cases are induced through this mechanism and show tachycardia-dependent blocks because of disease of the His-Purkinje system. Second, blocks can be induced by AV nodal ischemia. Such patients may experience chest pain during exercise testing and may show ischemic changes on ECGs and atherosclerotic lesions on coronary angiograms. If, second-degree AV block is precipitated during physiologic sinus tachycardia, then the refractory period of the relevant conducting system is not under vagal influence, and the block is likely infranodal (ie, in the bundle of His proper). A lesion in the AV node giving rise to first- and second-degree AV block would be expected to retain sufficient vagal potential to shorten with vagolytic influence.\n\nConclusion: Our case illustrates the utility of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients whose etiology of dyspnea is unclear after initial evaluation. Determination of the underlying cause of this patient's dyspnea led to prompt and effective treatment.\n\n28 Pulmonary Tuberculosis in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Negative Patient with Sickle Cell Trait\n\nCandice Baldeo, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Robert Ali, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL, Pramod Reddy, MD; University of Florida Health, Jacksonville, FL\n\nCase Presentation: A 27-year-old female with a medical history of preeclampsia and hypertension presented with a cough lasting 2 weeks. The cough was productive of thick, yellow sputum but negative for hemoptysis. Her positive constitutional symptoms included malaise, headache, and an equivocal 5-lb weight loss, but she denied fever, chills, and night sweats. She also had a 5 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and frequently abused cocaine. She denied any other drug use, including via intravenous routes. Besides living in a homeless shelter several years earlier, she had no other known tuberculosis (TB) exposures and was never in jail. She tested negative for TB in 2009 and negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2012. Chest x-ray revealed a cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest without contrast confirmed the cavitary lesion in the superior segment of the left lower lobe with a largest dimension of 6.7 cm. It also showed additional satellite lesions within the lung apices bilaterally and evidence of possible partially calcified hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. Sputum smear revealed 4+ acid-fast bacilli, and polymerase chain reaction was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. A repeat HIV test was negative. She was administered 4-drug TB therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, plus vitamin B6. Coincidentally, she was also found to have microcytic anemia, and iron studies were consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. Follow-up hemoglobin electrophoresis was positive for sickle cell trait, and she was administered Venofer while an inpatient and discharged on oral ferrous sulfate.\n\nDiscussion: The radiologic findings of pulmonary TB differ between HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients because of the poor cellular immunity in HIV-infected patients. These findings may not be restricted to the HIV population only but may also encompass individuals who have a compromised cellular immunity for any reason. Cavitary formation is observed in immunocompetent patients, indicating cell-mediated immunity is intact. However, cavitary lesions in the mid and lower lung zones are more typical in HIV-negative patients because of poor cellular immunity. The CT finding in our case could have been influenced by the sickle cell trait. For the immunocompetent patient, cavitary lesions usually predominate in the upper lobes upon reactivation, but for immunocompromised patients there is a predilection for primary disease in the mid and lower zones.\n\nConclusion: HIV is the most common cause of immunodeficiency predisposing to this typical presentation. Given our patient's generally good state of health, the only factor that may account for her immunodeficiency and presentation is her sickle cell trait.\n\n29 A Rare Case of Nocardia-Mycobacterium avium Complex Coinfection in a Patient with Malignancy\n\nDaisy Azana, MD; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, GA, Amira Elmagbari, MD; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, GA, Maruf Ali, MD; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, GA, Tarek Alansari, MD; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, GA, John Ouderkirk, MD; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 34-year-old male prison inmate who had been diagnosed with brain astrocytoma 3 months before, status post neurosurgical resection and local radiotherapy on a high dose of steroids, was admitted to the hospital because of complaint of cough, hemoptysis, and fever. Prior to admission, the patient started to have a cough that was associated with progressive shortness of breath and minimal chest pain; he also had hemoptysis approximately 20 mL that caused him to report to the emergency department. At the physical examination, he appeared cachectic but in no apparent respiratory distress. His oxygen saturation was 94% on room air, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 115/80 mmHg, heart rate was 90 bpm, and temperature was 38.2°C. He had no palpable lymphadenopathy; auscultation of the lungs revealed crackles and decreased air entry at the bases. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Comprehensive blood counts and basic metabolic panel were within normal limits, and human immunodeficiency virus serology test was negative. Chest radiography showed multiple cavitary lesions throughout the lungs with overlying consolidative changes, and subsequent computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple cavitary lesions and innumerable tree-in-bud opacities in addition to left pleural effusion. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done, and the transbronchial biopsy showed rod and filamentous-like bacteria. Two weeks later, sputum culture was positive for aerobic actinomycetes and acid-fast bacilli, identified as Nocardia veterana and Mycobacterium avium complex. Combination antibiotic therapy with intravenous amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole was started with a goal to continue the treatment for 1 year.\n\nDiscussion: Cellular immunosuppression caused by long-term treatment with steroids and malignancies constitutes an important predisposing factor for Nocardia infections. Between the coinfections that these patients experience, nontuberculous Mycobacterium species are of special interest. Data suggest a unique association between the occurrence of nocardiosis and the subsequent development of nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, although this phenomenon may represent a chance occurrence in a population predisposed to infectious complications. There are 3 possible explanations for this coinfection: simultaneous infection by both organisms with variable clinical expression of disease; mutational or recombinant event; and induction of a state of immune tolerance, possibly via an antigen-specific mechanism. However, the exact pathogenesis of the coinfection is still unknown.\n\nConclusion: The possibility of concomitant infections in immunocompromised patients, as reported in this case, highlights the importance of testing for opportunistic organisms such as Nocardia and nontuberculous Mycobacterium even when the clinical presentation and radiologic features are nonspecific. Early diagnosis facilitates early treatment.\n\n30 A Commonly Used Medication with a Rare Side Effect\n\nMohsen Hasanin, MD; UAB Montgomery, Montgomery, AL\n\nCase Presentation: A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency department with the complaint of 2 days of abdominal pain without significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. He had been started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for tooth infection 5 days prior. His physical examination showed abdominal distention and epigastric tenderness without guarding. Medical history included seizures and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Home medications were pantoprazole, phenobarbital, and Tegretol. Laboratory tests were significant for mild leukocytosis, hemoglobin of 11, and hematocrit of 34; metabolic profile showed normal aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, lipase, and lipid profile. Abdominal ultrasound did not show gallstones, but computed tomography of the abdomen with contrast showed pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid. Doxycycline was discontinued, and the patient was started on intravenous fluids, pain control, and tube feedings. The patient's symptoms improved significantly, and he was able to tolerate oral feedings. He was discharged after an uncomplicated course and was told not to take doxycycline again.\n\nDiscussion: Drug-induced pancreatitis represents 1.4% of all causes of acute pancreatitis. Diagnostic criteria include the following: pancreatitis develops during drug therapy, other possible causes of pancreatitis are eliminated, pancreatitis resolves after discontinuing the suspected drug, and pancreatitis recurs after reusing the same drug. Drug-induced pancreatitis is classified as definite, highly probable, or weakly probable in correlation with the mentioned criteria. Our patient developed acute pancreatitis 3 days after the administration of doxycycline, and the pancreatitis resolved 3 days after discontinuation of the drug. All other possible factors such as alcohol use, gallstones, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, and malignancy were eliminated by physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies. Adverse effects of doxycycline include elevation of liver and renal function tests, nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. Doxycycline is part of the tetracycline group of antibiotics that is linked to few cases of acute pancreatitis. Suggested theories include intrinsic toxins vs idiosyncratic reactions.\n\nConclusion: Our patient most likely suffered from acute pancreatitis due to doxycycline because the other causes of pancreatitis were eliminated. This adverse effect is not well known and is probably quite rare. Physicians should consider acute pancreatitis in patients who develop nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain when taking doxycycline, a drug commonly used inside and outside hospitals. If doxycycline is suspected as the causative agent, it should be discontinued, and readministration should be avoided.\n\n31 An Unusual Presentation of Tuberculosis\n\nKavita Pal, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Melissa Dakkak, DO; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, Pramod Reddy, MD; University of Florida-Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL\n\nCase Presentation: A 24-year-old homosexual Filipino male with a medical history of asthma presented with a 6-week history of nonproductive cough, fevers, shortness of breath, and a 30-lb unintentional weight loss. His symptoms worsened despite the use of rescue inhalers and 2 full courses of antibiotics. He was thin and had fever and profound tachycardia. On physical examination, he had palpable bilateral axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory testing only showed hyponatremia. Chest x-ray showed a right paratracheal mass. The latter was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest that revealed a large hypodense anterior mediastinal mass measuring 6.3 cm × 5 cm × 5.8 cm, a large axillary lymph node measuring 3 cm × 2.4 cm, and multiple enlarged prevascular lymph nodes. The mediastinal mass demonstrated significant narrowing of the superior vena cava and almost occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein. The mass was also described to likely have some central necrosis. The CT scan also revealed lymph nodes highly suspicious of a neoplastic process. The patient underwent an endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the right lower paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes. Cytology revealed granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli. His Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction test was positive. The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) was made, and the patient began therapy. He was concurrently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with a CD4 count of 77.\n\nDiscussion: Mediastinal and lung masses are commonly seen in practice. Prompt investigation is warranted when a mass is discovered. Pathogenesis can vary from benign to highly malignant. Given our patient's age group, symptoms, and CT findings, lymphoma was initially our primary differential diagnosis. Although rare, TB can present as a mediastinal mass and usually presents as lymphadenitis or mediastinitis. What makes this case particularly interesting and unique is the significant narrowing of the superior vena cava. In the preantibiotic era, infections such as aspergillosis, histoplasma, or TB were a frequent cause of superior vena cava obstruction. In the postantibiotic era, however, malignancy is the most common cause for superior vena cava obstruction, with 95% of them because of lung cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although our patient did not have superior vena cava syndrome, he had significant narrowing of his superior vena cava and almost occlusion of the brachiocephalic vein. He had multiple collateral vessels to compensate for the obstruction that was observed on CT imaging. The obstruction was not considered a medical emergency.\n\nConclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of including TB in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses. Although rare, TB can present as a large mediastinal mass with adjacent lymphadenopathy, especially in immunocompromised patients, and further investigation must be pursued immediately to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant TB.\n\n32 A Case of Symptomatic Kommerell Diverticulum\n\nTarek Alansari, MD; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, GA\n\nCase Presentation: A 30-year-old African American male with no significa"
