        "text": "This fellowship was established to honor the memory of David W. Parks ’79 by the members of the History department in the Spring of 2016. The Parks Fellowship supports senior History majors in pursuing either history-related internships or comps research during Winter break.\n\nDavid W. Parks Senior Comps Research and Unpaid Internship Financial Support Fellowships\n\nSenior History majors who are interested in being considered for a David W. Parks Fellowship must submit the following materials to the History Office by or before: Tuesday, October 31, 2023.\n\nA resume or CV;\n\nEither a description of the unpaid internship experience and how it relates to your study of history, or a description of your comps research plans;\n\nA complete budget for your request (please include all expected travel, lodging, food, and research expenses) and a list of any other funding received (or that you have applied for).\n\nPlease send any questions to Professor Bill North, Chair of the David W. Parks Fellowship Committee.\n\nDavid W. Parks entered Carleton in fall 1976. He was a star tennis player at his high school and at Carleton. He also enjoyed travel, and had been to Russia, Europe, & the Far East. His ambition was to attend law school. At Carleton he worked doggedly toward that goal even though, since fall of 1979, his health forced him to take several leaves of absence. David left the campus for the last time in November 1981. He died of cancer at his home in Belleville, Illinois, on January 31, 1982.\n\nWhen initially created, the Parks Fund supported the History Department’s collection of films for teaching, which we still have and use: David W. Parks Film Collection.\n\nPrevious Recipients"
