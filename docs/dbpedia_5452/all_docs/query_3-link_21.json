        "text": "Dave Parks serves as the Executive VP of Donor and Board Advancement. During his time on staff with FCA, he served in several roles, most recently as Regional Director of Donors and Boards. God has used these experiences to equip him for this new part of the journey.\n\nDave grew up in Rochester, NY where enjoyed every sport he had the opportunity to play. He went on to play and coach college football at the University at Albany and would later coach at St. John Fisher College. While coaching at St. John Fisher College, Dave began to offer Bible studies for any players who were interested. Excited about what he saw God doing through these meetings, Dave went looking for more athletically focused Christian resources and found his way to the FCA website for the first time. Shortly thereafter, Dave joined staff as the State Director for New York in 2012.\n\nDave and his wife Kate were married in 2012 and enjoy time at home with their three children, Jacob, Vivian and Evelyn, and being involved in all their activities."
