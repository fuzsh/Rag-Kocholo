        "text": "Mental Health Therapist\n\nMany of us feel out of step with others around us. Difficulties with completing tasks and organization lead to struggles and frustration in relationships. Difficulty with social skills and anxiety make it hard to reach out to others for friendship or dating. Some of us feel shame and isolation from ADHD, autism, and other forms of neurodiversity. Our unique hobbies or interests keep us out of step. Shame keeps us from exploring who we are in friendships, dating, and sexually. People often do not see us. We feel alone. This manifests as depression, anxiety, and difficulty regulating our emotions.\n\nBeing Black, queer, and neurodivergent, I have had the same struggles. You can create the life you want. I want to support you in pushing away trauma and shame to build the life and relationships you desire. You can start dating. You can reduce tensions between you and your partners. You can explore your interests without fear.\n\nI specialize in executive functioning difficulties in individuals and couples exploring identity. I am also BIPOC, kink, and CNM affirming. With the proper tools, you can fully engage in life instead of watching from the shadows.
