        "text": "(born 1928). American linguist Noam Chomsky once described his goal as finding “the principles common to all languages that enable people to speak creatively and freely.” He believed that children are born with an unconscious knowledge of the basic principles underlying all languages. Chomsky gave linguistics a new direction and strongly influenced the fields of philosophy and psychology. He was also influential as a leftist political activist.\n\nBorn on December 7, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Avram Noam Chomsky was introduced to linguistics by his father, a Hebrew scholar who worked with historical linguistics. Noam studied at the University of Pennsylvania, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and then was a junior fellow at Harvard University in 1951–55. He received a doctorate in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955 and then began teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAt the time, the focus of linguistics in the United States was the study of speech sounds and how they are combined in various languages. Chomsky believed that it is less important to study the structures of different languages themselves than it is to study the mental structures common to speakers of all languages that allow them to learn the languages to which they are exposed as young children. He stressed that all children go through the same stages of language development regardless of the language they are learning. They also pick up the language spoken around them relatively quickly on their own, without much specific instruction. He thus believed that the proper focus of linguistics is to develop a theory of a universal grammar, an inborn faculty that allows young children to so easily acquire a rich knowledge of their language. Moreover, an understanding of this faculty can shed light on how the human brain is organized.\n\nChomsky also wrote and lectured widely on politics. A self-described libertarian socialist, he criticized what he considered to be the antidemocratic character of corporate power and its negative influence on U.S. foreign policy, domestic politics, and the mass media."
