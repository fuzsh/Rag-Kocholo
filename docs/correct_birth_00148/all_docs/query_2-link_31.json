        "text": "“Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.”- Noam Chomsky\n\nNoam Chomsky is an American philosopher, logician, linguist, cognitive scientist, activist and political commentator. Born on December 7th, 1928, he is well-known as the “Father of modern linguistics”. He is one of the significant personalities in analytic philosophy. He currently teaches as a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has also written more than 100 books, been voted as “World’s Top Public Intellectual” in a poll conducted in 2005. He graduated from University of Pennsylvania in the field of linguistics. He obtained his BA, MA and PhD in linguistics. After that, he served at Harvard University at the society of fellows.\n\nNoam Chomsky is one of the most eminent cultural personalities. He became an important personality in the field of linguistics by developing Chomsky hierarchy, Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem and the universal grammar theory. Noam Chomsky acquired public attention by his open opposition to Vietnam war. Though he got arrested multiple times for his open opposition but he gained popularity as an anti-war activist. He is also a humanitarian with profound interest in anti-war activisim as well as public activism.\n\nNoam Chomsky has produced a diverse range of theories and concepts in the fields of psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, philosophy, political science, logic and programming language and theory. At present, Chomsky is a well-known political activist, US foreign policy, state capitalism and news media critic. He is a supporter of libertarian socialism as well as anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nNoam Chomsky developed a linguistic theory based on the proposition that the structure of a particular language is determined biologically by the human mind that is based on the language principles. According to this linguistic principle, language can be genetically transmitted and human beings possess similar language structure irrespective of their differences in social and cultural factors.Chomsky is prominent for the fact that he investigates a wide variety of formal languages to assess the capability of that language to capture key properties of a certain language. His very own Chomsky hierarchy allocates formal grammars into classes with expressive power at an increasing rate. This implies that every unique successive class has an ability to generate a diverse set of formal languages from the original one.\n\nNoam Chomsky is a living legend in the field of linguistics as well as politics. Chomsky’s unmatched concepts in the field of linguistics has earned his work the title of “the most dynamic and influential” school of thought developed. There are many academic achievements, awards and honors earned by Naom chomsky especially by the prestigious universities including Oxford University, University of Cambridge as well as University of Toronto to name a few. He was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize in 2011 as well as at AI’s Hall of Fame for his contributions in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nBuy books by Noam Chomsky"
