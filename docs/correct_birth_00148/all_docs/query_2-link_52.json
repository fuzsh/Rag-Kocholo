        "text": "Interesting Noam Chomsky Facts: Avram Noam Chomsky is the oldest child born to a middle-class Jewish family in Philadelphia. His parents were professors at Mikveh Israel religious school where his father was also the principal. As a child Chomsky experienced anti-semitism from the German and Irish communities in his neighborhood. That and the influence of his socialist relatives created a strong attachment to leftist causes. He attended Oak Lane Country Day School where at the age of ten he wrote a paper on the spread of fascism after the Spanish Civil War. In 1945 Noam Chomsky entered the University of Pennsylvania and he obtained his BA with his honor's thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew.\" He earned his MA in 1951 and his master's thesis would be published as a book. From 1951 to 1955 he did doctoral research at Harvard and in 1955 received his PhD from Penn with a thesis on transformational grammar. It would be published in 1975 as The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory in which he theorizes that the principles of language structure are biologically determined and genetically transmitted. His theory that linguistic structures reflect a \"universal grammar\" and not universally accepted. In 1955 he began work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he taught linguistics and philosophy. From 1958 to 1959 he was National Science Foundation fellow at Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study. His ideas attracted national attention and he was appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists and he edited the Studies in Language Series for Harper and Row. He wrote numerous books on linguistics and linguistic theory including Aspects of the Theory of Syntax and Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar in 1966. In 1967 he entered the world of public political debate with his essay, The Responsibility of Intellectuals, which was critical of America's involvement in the Vietnam War. He supported the anti-draft movement and was included on President Richard Nixon's enemies list. His writings and lectures generated much controversy and he was arrested multiple times. His work in linguistics continued to earn him international recognition and in 1974 he became a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He continued to work in both the political and linguistic fields and in 1979 published The Political Economy of Human Rights."
