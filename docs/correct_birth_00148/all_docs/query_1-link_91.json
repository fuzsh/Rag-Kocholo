        "text": "1. THE BIOGRAPHY OF Noam Chomsky As seen by ABU R. CHOWDHURY GEORGIANA TACHE CSCE 619 Prof. Dr. Dasgupta Spring 2015\n\n2. Noam Chomsky is an eminent American theoretical linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, logician, political commentator, social justice activist, and anarcho­syndicalist advocate, who radically changed the field of linguistics by stating that language is a uniquely human, biologically based cognitive capacity. He suggested that innate traits in the human brain give birth to both language and grammar. As the most important figure in “cognitive revolution” and “analytic philosophy”, Chomsky’s wide­ranging influence also extends to computer science and mathematics. Sometimes described as the \"father of modern linguistics\", Chomsky has spent most of his career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he is currently Professor Emeritus, and has authored over 100 books. He has been described as a prominent cultural figure, and was voted the \"world's top public intellectual\" in a 2005 poll. Early life, family and education Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928 to a middle­class Ashkenazi Jewish family in Philadelphia. His father was the Ukrainian­born William \"Zev\" Chomsky, who had come to the USA in 1913, and his mother was the Lithuanian­born Elsie Simonofsky. William, the father, was very involved in the study of the Hebrew grammar, teaching it in schools and publishing different papers on it. He also placed a great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\" [1], a view subsequently adopted by his son Noam. Noam was the Chomsky family's first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later. The brothers were raised in a Jewish environment, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings which Chomsky later labeled as anti­zionist. Because of his Jewish heritage, Noam Chomsky faced anti­semitism as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities in Philadelphia. Chomsky's primary education was at Oak Lane Country Day School, an independent institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non­competitive atmosphere. It was here that he wrote his first article, aged 10, on the spread of fascism, following the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish Civil War. Aged 12, he moved on to secondary education at Central High School, where he joined various clubs and societies but was\n\n3. troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching that they employed. From age 13, he started traveling to New York and there his political interests would get shaped. His uncle, living there and owning a newspaper stand, would often join other Jewish leftists to debate the issues of the day. Whenever visiting his relatives in New York City, Chomsky also used to visit left­wing and anarchist bookstores, voraciously reading political literature. He entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1945, where he was attracted to the field of linguistics. Although dissatisfied with the strict structure of the university, he was encouraged to continue by the Russian­born linguist Zellig Harris, who convinced Chomsky to major in the subject. He received his B.A. (1949) and M.A. (1951) in nontraditional modes of study. Chomsky's BA thesis was titled \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\". He continued Ph.D. at U. Pennsylvania as well as Harvard; his dissertation was expressed later in the book “Syntactic Structures” (p. 1957). During that time in 1955, he joins MIT as a professor in department of Linguistics & Philosophy. His first work on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, is a book that radically opposed the dominant Harris­Bloomfield trend in the field. The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline. Linguist John Lyons later asserted that it \"revolutionized the scientific study of language.\" In 1959 he attracted further attention for his review of B.F. Skinner's 1957 book Verbal Behavior in the journal Language, in which he argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics. Chomsky was a family oriented person from early age whether it was with his parents or with his own family. He entered a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since they were very young. They were married in 1949 and remained together until her death in 2008. The couple raised three children and even though Chomsky got more and more involved in politics in years to come, he was known as a good father and husband, all his life. His debate quality was well known and the political activism made him famous for a number of times. His research is honored by universities from Calcutta to Chicago. He got honorary degrees from more than forty colleges. Biographer Robert F. Barsky talked about the passion of Chomsky as follows: \"What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious\n\n4. contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.\" [1] There is no doubt that his family and education shaped him what he has become, a symbol of knowledge and intellect. Language in his life Chomsky's parents' first language was Yiddish, but Chomsky said it was a \"taboo\" in his family to speak it. Unlike his father, his mother Elsie spoke \"ordinary New York English\". He learned Classical Hebrew as a boy, his M.A. thesis was \"A Generative phonology of Modern Hebrew”. He had students from a number of countries, who had written on other languages such as Japanese, Icelandic, Italian, and Hungarian. Even in 1945 Chomsky embarked on a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where his primary interest was in learning Arabic. Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew. In one interview, Prof. Chomsky mentions having taught courses in 'Scientific French' and 'Scientific German' at MIT in the 1950s, when familiarity with these languages was considered useful for students in the sciences and engineering. There are many very legitimate and well­respected linguists who only make research for one language (Noam Chomsky being one of them). Many critics claim that he was more inclined to English and other European languages than Sanskrit or any Asian or African languages. He had also never had much interest in Modern art and Music where many times a language does pass through generations and evolve. He might have improved his theories if he had taken these in consideration. It is still a myth how many languages he actually knew, but despite this, his works massively influenced the world of languages. Contributions and Achievements Noam Chomsky became a member of the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and performed his services as a visiting professor. Influenced by the ideas of his mentor, Zellig Harris, Chomsky published his famous work, “Syntactic Structures” in 1957. During that era, concepts\n\n5. regarding the origin of language were inspired by behaviorist ideas, for instance those of renowned Swedish psychologist B. F. Skinner, who advocated that newborn babies had a blank mind (tabula rasa) and that children acquired language by means of learning and mimicry. Chomsky rejected that belief and argued that human beings were in fact born with the innate ability to realize the generative grammars that constitute every human language. Children make use of this innate ability to learn the languages that they are exposed to. Furthermore, he believed that the basics concepts of language were innate in every human mind and only influenced by one's syntactical environment. He declared: “Languages are innate and that the differences we see are only due to parameters developed over time in our brains, helping to explain why children are able to learn different languages more easily than adults”. Chomsky established his linguistic theory in 1965 with “Aspects of the Theory of Syntax”, and in 1975, with “The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory”. Later works in cognitive science supported his claims. The influence of Chomsky on linguistics is similar to that of Charles Darwin on evolution and biology. His ideas have significant logical implications for various subjects of psychology, and also extends to cognitive science, anthropology, sociology and neurology. The context of linguistics Chomsky's contributions to theoretical linguistics is highly influential for any linguist who wants to understand the current paradigms. Every “other” school that occurs has to define its position towards Chomsky's theories. His first book, “Syntactic Structures” doesn't move too far away from the existing framework, being in accordance to the “Bloomfieldian” school dominating at that time. He formalized various systems of generative grammar. The concept of Generative grammar is a research paradigm initiated by Chomsky, today regarded as a linguistic theory which considers grammar as a system of rules generating exactly the combinations of words which form grammatical sentences in a given language. Generative grammar is mostly preoccupied with the study of syntax, but also with morphology and phonology. Chomsky believed that many properties of a generative grammar come from a universal grammar innate to human brain, and not because they are learned. In his view, the first such generative grammar in a modern sense was “Panini’s grammar”, composed in the 6th century BC in India. After 1950, many approaches of the generative\n\n6. grammar occurred and also, the Chomsky hierarchy brought new ways of comparing and describing them. Along with the Generative grammar, Chomsky also forwarded an argument that the behaviorist explanations of human behavior are inadequate, thus fueling the “cognitive revolution” that took place in the 1960s and gave birth to cognitive science. The simplest grammars capable of generating an infinite set of sentences with a finite vocabulary and a finite set of possibly recursive rules are called by Chomsky finite­state grammars. The modeling of such grammars is borrowed from the automata theory which had just emerged in computer science and which he drove one step further. Chomsky proved that the framework of finite­state grammar is insufficient to describe certain sentences in English language because of the possible dependencies between non­adjacent words, themselves separated by structures with the same properties, called “mirror­image” properties. The second model Chomsky proposed is called phrase structure grammar, with a more satisfactory application. This new grammar is powerful and able to describe the whole finite­state grammar, as well as to address the shortages it has. It makes use of labels and tree diagrams to express the syntactic value. Although Chomsky does not prove that there are sentences that cannot be generated with the current model, he claims that some sentences can be only “clumsily” described in this manner. The third model Chomsky created is called the transformational grammar, with considerably extended rules generating much more possible output as before. In contrast to the previous models, the rules can be context­sensitive. A Transformational grammar is a generative grammar, especially from a natural language, that involves the use of defined operations (“transformations”) to produce new sentences from existing ones. Today's research is inspired from Chomsky's Minimalist program. This system of transformational grammar brought a touch of mathematical description for the language. The mathematical rigor and precision of formulating properties was the best contribution he had to linguistics. After 20 years of publishing “The syntactic structures”, Chomsky's theories were still a matter of controversy among linguists, some of them adopting alternative Chomskyan and post­Chomskyan versions of transformational grammar.\n\n7. The Chomsky's known works in the linguistics field influenced the area so greatly, that today we can speak of three phases of language theory, that are: the combinatoric, the cognitive and the minimalist – “inspired” from more developed sciences: engineering, biology and physics respectively. Chomsky's writings can be mapped to these periods as: “Syntactic Structures” (1957) for combinatoric, “Aspects of a Theory of Syntax” and “Lectures on government and binding” for cognitive, and “The minimalist program” corresponding to the last phase. The combinatoric stage states that “The fundamental aim of linguistic analysis of language L is to separate the grammatical sequences which are the sentences of L from the ungrammatical sequences which are not sentences of L. The grammar of L will thus be a device that generates all of the grammatical sequences of L and none of the ungrammatical ones” (1957). Thus, all language sentences belong to one of two infinite sets: either well­ formed or ill formed. A grammarian should find rules that will generate all the well­formed sentences without any of the ill­formed ones. It is therefore a computational problem, also called a combinatoric problem. This first stage succeeded in developing suitable formal tools for the study of natural­ language grammars. The cognitive era has two parts: an early one and a late one. In “Aspects of a Theory of Syntax”, Chomsky emphasizes the question on how young children acquire a language and divides the grammar into descriptively adequate and explanatory adequate. The era mainly focused on how they go from primary linguistic data (PLD), consisting of well­formed short sentences, to obtaining a grammar for the language that they can use for generating new sentences – and that must have a biological underline. In “Syntactic Structures”, Chomsky attempted to develop grammars with combinatoric properties, whereas in “Aspects of a Theory of Syntax”, the focus shifted more into the cognitive area and the way native people interiorize rules. The minimalist era started in early 1990s after Chomsky's paper publication, and it is attempting to answer the central question “why a language has the properties it has”. Its main idea is that universal grammar has a perfect design “in the sense that it contains only what is necessary to meet our conceptual and physical needs” [2]. In “Aspects of the Theory of Syntax” as well as in “Cartesian linguistics” and “Language and Mind”, Chomsky started to consider linguistics in relation to cognitive psychology and philosophy, all because of the aspect of\n\n8. creativity – the fact that children are able to understand and produce a large number of utterances that they have never met before. Connection with computer science Around 1950s, a new idea emerged in the realm of computing: how to compose computer programs without having to deal with more complicated aspects pertaining to the machine architecture. It was the time for creating formal (programming) language definitions that will be closer to human natural understanding rather than to machine specification. This problem was split into two: first, to design a mathematical language for expressing an algorithm, and second – to translate these programs into machine code. The first problem was resolved with the emergence of a new discipline, called design of computer programs, and the second – by the emergence of compiler design. The mathematical high­level programming language envisioned was materialized with the advent of Fortran, from 1954, quickly adopted by the scientific community. Later on, the business computing people would also get a language adapted to their needs, named Cobol. Within this context, there was not much awareness at that time that a PL description can be, itself, a scientific problem. It all changed in Europe with advancing the idea of an “unified programming language”. In consequence, Algol and its versions appeared as languages to describe algorithms in official publications. The language of Algol made use of entities called blocks encapsulated between begin and end keywords. Inside a block, there were typed variables and procedures as well as branches. For the first time, a scientist called John Backus borrowed from linguistics the terms “syntax” and “semantics” that could be as well applied to describe the Algol language. He also introduced the concept of “meta­language” formulas to create program specifications, BNF (Backus Normal Forms). The formulas establish syntactic rules for a valid Algol usage. In parallel to the BNF meta­language, it was Chomsky's new theories that gained attention. He clarified for the first time what a language should mean ­ “a (possibly infinite) set of sentences, each sentence being composed of a finite set of elements” [3]. The set of elements was referred to as the alphabet, but not every possible sentence is valid unless it obeys a set of grammar rules. The meta­linguistic formulas from the Algol 60 Revised Report corresponded\n\n9. to Chomsky's formulas and interpretations. A grammar with rules involving terminal and non­terminal symbols was called context­free grammar, which belongs to Chomsky's “Type 2” languages from his hierarchy. Although this type of language proved inadequate for describing natural languages in linguistics, in the field of computer science it became very important and remained useful until today, especially in the sphere of compilers. The Chomsky hierarchy Also known as Chomsky­Schutzenberger hierarchy, it appeared in 1956. Class Grammar Languages Automation Type ­ 0 Unrestricted Recursively enu­ merable (Turing­ recognizable) Turing machine Type – 1 Context­sensi­ tive Context­sensi­ tive Linear­bounded Type – 2 Context­free Context­free Pushdown Type – 3 Regular Regular Finite Type 0 grammars are unrestricted grammars, also known as recursively enumerable languages, include all formal grammars. The languages generated can all be recognized by a Turing machine. Type 0 includes all the next three types as its subsets, but no machine can ever deal with its languages. Examples of Type 0 languages which are not a part of any of the three subsets are: akbkck , or aj | j = 2k, etc. Type 1 grammars are the context­sensitive grammars that generate the context­sensitive languages. Such rules look like: A α β → α γ β, where A must be a non­terminal. The language generated can be recognized by a linear bounded automaton. The languages are powerful and associated with powerful machines. An example of grammar of Type 1 is: S aSBA→ S abA→ AB BA→ bB bb→ bA ba→ aA aa→\n\n10. This grammar defines the language an bn an , which is not context­free. Type 2 grammars (context­free grammars) generate context­free languages. Its specific rules look like: A → γ, with A a non­terminal and γ is containing terminals and/or non­terminals. Its languages can be recognized by non­ deterministic pushdown automaton. One subset, the deterministic context­ free language, is widely found in the theory of programming languages, a grammar for generating it being the LL parser – a top­down parser which analyzes input from left to right, making a leftmost derivation of a sentence. It is a simple language generator, but more powerful than Type 2. An example of language is one for an arithmetic expression in a programming language: exp ::= exp PLUS exp ::= exp MINUS exp ::= exp TIMES exp ::= INT | ID Type 3 grammars generate the regular languages. Its rules have a single non­terminal in the left side and a single terminal in the right side. It can by obtained by applying regular expressions and modeled using a finite­state automaton. In programming languages, the theory is used in the lexical analysis and for matching patterns. It is the simplest language generator. An example of language is a natural numbers production, which in regular expression can be written as 0 | [1­9][0­9]* . Nowadays, most of the modern programming languages have support for regular expression interpretation, which is a very simple and elegant method for testing patterns. AI and NLP Another field that Noam Chomsky influenced is the Natural Language Processing from AI. The field of NLP originated in 1940, and at the time Chomsky published his first major book, he raised some problems regarding the validity of certain sentences, which are grammatically incorrect. He claimed that they are expected to be classified as non­sense by the machine models as well. The field of NLP split into two until 1970s: symbolic and stochastic research respectively. The symbolic or rule­based branch corresponded to research in formal languages and syntax generation, and was composed of linguists and computer scientists working together to create what they considered to be the beginning of Artificial Intelligence. The stochastic branch, in change, focused on problems of character recognition and pattern matching.\n\n11. From 1983­1993, the researchers decided that certain arguments of Chomsky and others from 1950s and 1960s were not as accurate as it was believed in that period. A recent argument took place between Noam Chomsky and Peter Norvig, researcher, professor and author of the most popular AI book in the world. Chomsky pronounced himself in favor of a theory of intelligence and language which would simplify the structures underneath as much as possible, whereas Norvig emphasized the statistical way, even though it might not satisfy or be good for every single piece of data. According to MIT's Technology Review in 2011, “Chomsky derided researchers in machine learning who use purely statistical methods to produce behavior that mimics something in the world, but who don’t try to understand the meaning of that behavior. Chomsky compared such researchers to scientists who might study the dance made by a bee returning to the hive, and who could produce a statistically based simulation of such a dance without attempting to understand why the bee behaved that way. “That’s a notion of [scientific] success that’s very novel. I don’t know of anything like it in the history of science,” said Chomsky.” On the other hand, Chomsky's theories became more and more complex as the years passed, models were no longer simple but depending on very many parameters. The current AI approach to language translation and understanding is massively relying on statistics, with the usage of big data, sometimes making grammar rules useless. The Google approach itself is not to really understand language, but to gather more and more data and then to deliver the most probable answer to a query. Norvig believes that human language is too complex to be described in a simple model that Chomsky insists upon. Psychology and cognitive science The Princeton scientist George Miller, who lived the birth of cognitive science, appreciated in 2003 that “Behaviorism was an exciting adventure for experimental psychology but by the mid­1950s it had become apparent that it could not succeed. As Chomsky remarked, defining psychology as the science of behavior was like defining physics as the science of meter reading (…) I was therefore ready for Chomsky’s alternative to Markov processes. Once I understood that Shannon’s Markov processes could not converge on natural language, I began to accept syntactic theory as a better account of the cognitive processes responsible for the structural aspects of human language. The grammatical rules that govern phrases and sentences are not\n\n12. behavior, they are mentalistic hypotheses about the cognitive processes responsible for the verbal behaviors we observe.” Slowly, the scientific community would disembarrass itself from the behaviorist ideas, as the above­mentioned suggested, that “In 1951, I apparently still hoped to gain scientific respectability by swearing allegiance to behaviorism. Five years later, inspired by such colleagues as Noam Chomsky and Jerry Bruner, I had stopped pretending to be a behaviorist. So I date the cognitive revolution in psychology to those years in the early 1950s.” He was later to become one of the founders of cognitive science. Political views Chomsky's intellectual life has been divided between his work in linguistics and his political activism, philosophy coming as a distant third. Nonetheless, his international political lectures and debates get more attention these days. Chomsky described himself as libertarian socialist, with sympathies for anarcho­syndicalism and of the left­wing of US politics. He has taken firm stands on multiple issues, such as freedom of speech, terrorism, US foreign affairs and wars in different parts of the world, US government, capitalism and corporatism, Middle East, etc. As for the Arab­Israeli conflict, Chomsky supports their cooperation and criticizes Israel's policies as well as the American support for Israel. Chomsky’s image in the academia world is an example of how a major intellectual voice can be silenced or marginalized in the world of universities. First of all, academic people insist to separate Chomsky the linguist from Chomsky the political speaker. As a linguist, Chomsky has authority and reputation. However, his critics regard him as having a questionable competence in foreign policy or political sciences in general. Chomsky’s political writings are rejected by scholars in the name of peer review. His style of writing is easily accessible and even simplistic, therefore in the eyes of scholars appearing not enough professional to consider. Outside of the USA, he is invited to give friendly talks in campuses, but in the US he still remains mostly ignored in relevant departments such as political sciences. However, Chomsky's linguistic theories and his political philosophy are by no means unconnected as he attacked the radical behaviorism and subsequently defending language as not merely “a set of habits” similar to animal communication. He posted the same criticism against the sociologists, psychologists and other social scientists often consulted by the government. The unification of his linguistics with his politics is based on"
