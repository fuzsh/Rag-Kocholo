An Interview with Paul Postal. Ordinary Working Grammarian (blog), (posted April 30, 2020, revised August 6, 2020).\n\n1. Early Years and Background\n\nChris:\n\nWhere were you born? And when?\n\nPaul:\n\nWeehawken, New Jersey. It is a town right across from Manhattan. There used to be a ferry connecting them. It was terminated by construction of Lincoln Tunnel. I was born on November 10, 1936.\n\nChris:\n\nDo you have any siblings? Male or female? Older or younger?\n\nPaul:\n\nMy sister is my only sibling. She is 4 years older than me and the healthiest person on earth. She has really never been sick in her whole adult life.\n\nChris:\n\nCan I ask what her occupation is? Or was, if she is retired?\n\nPaul:\n\nBefore she was married, she worked for a magazine or magazines in NYC. I forget what exactly she was doing. After she got married, she didn’t work for many years…traditional pattern. Then later she worked for the New York State Nurses’ Association; I think she was their public relations director.\n\nAs she is 87, of course she is retired.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you ever talk about linguistics with your mother, father or sister? If so, what did they think about it?\n\nPaul:\n\nPretty much not. No interest, no understanding of questions involved.\n\nChris:\n\nHow many children do you have, and how old are they?\n\nPaul:\n\nTwo; one female age 55, one male age 52.\n\nChris:\n\nDid they ever express an interest in linguistics?\n\nPaul:\n\nNone.\n\nChris:\n\nWhere were you brought up? I remember you telling me that you moved at some point.\n\nPaul:\n\nWe lived for a year after I was born somewhere in New Jersey close to Weehawken. Then we moved to Washington DC, for about a year I think. And then to Silver Spring Maryland, a close in suburb of DC. We stayed there until the end of the war, and in 1946 moved to Long Island, a place called Lakeview, where we lived through my years in High School.\n\nChris:\n\nDo you remember the names of your elementary school, junior high school and high school?\n\nPaul:\n\nParkside Elementary School, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland\n\nWoodfield Road School, Lakeview, New York\n\nMalverne High School, Malverne, New York\n\nThere was no junior high school or middle school, the High School covered grades 7-12.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat were your father and mother’s occupations?\n\nPaul:\n\nMy mother had no occupation outside the home after she got married. I believe she worked for a school board and they had a rule that married women could not be employees. It was the depression and I guess the feeling was one job per family was the maximum. My father was in Jewish public relations.\n\nChris:\n\nSo, I guess this is him:\n\nBERNARD POSTAL, ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF THE JEWISH WEEK AND A WRITER\n\nYour father was a well-known intellectual. This says to me you came from a very highly educated family.\n\nPaul:\n\nNot really. My father never finished college; my mother never attended college. Almost none of their relatives could have been considered intellectuals.\n\nChris:\n\nAre you Jewish?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, by traditional criterion. My mother was Jewish.\n\nChris:\n\nIf so, did being Jewish play any particular role in your education?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes/no. My parents of course insisted I go to Jewish school for the minimum number of years. I was not interested and it had no lasting consequences.\n\nChris:\n\nDid your father and mother also come from New York, or did they come from other countries?\n\nPaul:\n\nMy father and mother both were born in the US, father in New York city, mother in New Jersey. Their parents were late 19th century immigrants from parts of eastern Europe which were sometimes in Poland and sometimes in Russia.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat was the intellectual environment of your home like growing up?\n\nPaul:\n\nMy father was a sort of intellectual, but at least when I knew him his interests were almost exclusively in Jewish affairs; I was not interested.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you have lots of books around the house?\n\nPaul:\n\nHe had a mass of books, thousands, some general, history, politics, little science, many novels, tons of stuff on Jewish matters, Israel, Jewish history.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you father talk about the books he wrote or related issues?\n\nPaul:\n\nI have no clear memories of this.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you read any of your father's 10 books growing up?\n\nPaul:\n\nMaybe one…no memory.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you have political debates?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, I think so, once we got to be older. Traditionally eastern European Jewish families are very argumentative.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you have relatives or family friends who were intellectuals, artists, scientists, politicians?\n\nPaul:\n\nNot really. My maternal grandfather was said to have been part of the Democratic political machine in Union City New Jersey (I think). But they got overconfident one election, not enough people voted and they got thrown out of office. That is when he got into the bar/liquor store business.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat were your intellectual interests in high school? Where you more of a math/science type person, or a language/literature type person, or something else? Were there any professors or courses in high school that had an influence on you?\n\nPaul:\n\nI didn’t really have any intellectual interests. Note that I skipped the fifth grade and thus went to high school very young. From most points of view, I didn’t belong there. I was an immature, undisciplined and uninspired student. That leaked over into college, where I started before I was 17. Again, from most points of view I didn’t belong there.\n\nChris:\n\nWere you into sports as a child? Which sports did you like?\n\nPaul:\n\nSomewhat, I liked baseball and played stickball whenever possible. Later I played some basketball. I was never very good at any of it.\n\nChris:\n\nDo you speak, read or write Hebrew or Yiddish?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you parents or grandparents speak Yiddish? Did you ever hear Yiddish being spoken by members of the family?\n\nPaul:\n\nMy parents did not speak it. They no doubt understood a little. I know my maternal grandparents spoke Yiddish. I heard them and other relatives speaking it. I do not know about my paternal grandparents as we had little contact with them.\n\nChris:\n\nOther than English, what languages do you speak? What languages have you tried to learn?\n\nPaul:\n\nFrench. I studied Spanish in high school and German and Spanish a bit in college, but I don’t think I ever really intended to learn them. I worked on Mohawk but never intended to learn to speak it.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you actually take French classes, or learn it on your own? Have you lived in France?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo, I have never taken any French class nor lived in France. I lived in Quebec for 6 months in 1960, but it is questionable whether they speak French there and I was working on Mohawk and utterly uninterested in French at the time.\n\nChris:\n\nDo you realize that some Canadians might be offended at this statement?\n\nPaul:\n\nI could care less how many Canadians I offend. The similarities between continental French and Quebecois are substantial. But the differences are many. One can be fooled because I think the people in Quebec learn some standard French in school. But particularly in terms of pronunciation, the unschooled pronunciation is essentially incomprehensible, and lexical differences are massive.\n\nChris:\n\nYou had the biggest collection of tawdry paperback French crime novels that I have ever seen (actually, I have never seen another such collection). As I recall there must have been over 100 books, maybe 200. You gave them all to me, and I in turn tried to give them to the NYU students. Where did you get those novels and what did you use them for?\n\nPaul:\n\nThat was just a drop in the bucket. Over the last 50 years I have owned and read somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 such books. I have given away most of them, but still have say 450-500, probably 100 or more unread. Originally, I got some during trips to France, as gifts (Gilles Fauconnier once came and gave me around twenty or so by the same author), later by trips to Montreal. There was a short period where one could get some in Manhattan, but those were new and thus expensive. Once the internet was established, I got and get them on line, mostly from the site Livreenpoche, where they have endless numbers of used books. One can also download French books from various sites and read them on a kindle, which I have.\n\nI had and have two goals: one hobby activity, two learning actual French rather than the stilted stuff taught in traditional ‘learn French’ volumes. It was also useful in getting a sense of French grammar for linguistic research purposes; I wrote a few papers and one book on French grammar.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you ever use example sentences from the tawdry French novels in your papers on French?\n\nPaul:\n\nDefinitely.\n\nChris:\n\nOther than reading tawdry French crime novels, do you have any other hobbies or interests that you would care to mention?\n\nPaul:\n\nI would go easy on tawdry…lots of them are not. One has to understand that France had a traditionally extremely prescriptive culture with respect to language as it appeared in writing. After a while, the canons of respectability just rendered ordinary colloquial speech beyond the pale. In Tesniere’s famous grammatical work, I recall that in 1936 he characterized the use of ‘on’ as a replacement of ’nous’ as somehow improper. I gave away that book, maybe to you, so I can’t check his exact words. So, the real fact is that the kind of literature I got interested in was one which simply ignored these unrealistic prescriptive ideas.\n\nI remember vaguely the first time I picked up a volume by an astoundingly widely-read author named Frederic Dard, who wrote mostly under the nom de plume San-Antonio, also the name of his heroic police character. Although I knew a good bit of basic French at the time, when I looked at the first page, it was mostly incomprehensible, filled with slang I had never heard of and much of which is not in standard dictionaries. But after a few years I could read such works, gradually learning more and more of the slang.\n\nOf course, there is always a question in literature of how much vulgarity, sex, violence, etc. is acceptable…but these things change. ‘fuck’ used to be shocking. I remember the first time I heard it (in the mouth of a young woman) in a 1960s movie, it was striking. Now, movies have hundreds of such occurrences and nobody blinks.\n\nChris:\n\nOK, but putting aside those novels, do you have any other hobbies or interests that you would care to mention?\n\nPaul:\n\nI am interested in various philosophical issues related to linguistics, but in a very amateurish way. Most of the discussions of e.g. the foundations of logic, etc. are too hard for me. But some of it is relevant to linguistics, e.g. to model-theoretic semantics. I was convinced by Katz’s arguments about that, and note that there is no real solution to the problems he pointed out (e.g. all necessary truths come out as identical, as do all necessary falsehoods). And there is another problem, which I have never seen discussed by linguists. It shows up in sentences like:\n\n(1) Absolutely every set (except the null set) has members.\n\nIf you consider how this is supposed to be analyzed, it turns out that one needs to talk about the denotation of ’set’, which is going to be a set of sets and for (1), the set of all sets. But it is not hard to show that there is no such set. I can send you works showing that. Nonetheless (1) is a perfectly fine sentence with a perfectly clear meaning (no problem in knowing how to translate it into French, etc.).\n\nI am also interested in political and social things, do a lot of surfing. I would never read any English fiction and haven’t in at least 40 years.\n\nOn the lighter side, I like to play pool, and in college I spent a great deal of time at it, rather than studying. I also played a lot at Yale. Since then, I have played only occasionally since I don’t have my own table.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you serve in the military?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo. I registered for the draft but we lived in an unincorporated area with lots of really poor people. I had the deferment of being in college and was never even called to take a physical. I did not volunteer.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat year was that?\n\nPaul:\n\nI was 18 in 1954. So, the Korean war was over and there was no new one. But the draft continued until sometime when Nixon was president.\n\nChris:\n\nWould you describe yourself as liberal or conservative politically? What political party do you belong to?\n\nPaul:\n\nI am very conservative. I have no political party. I think the remark of the wonderful Thomas Sowell is accurate: “The only reason to vote for Republicans is Democrats.”\n\nChris:\n\nHow about your parents? What were their political views?\n\nPaul:\n\nWhen I was young, I remember my father telling me: ’The worst Democrat is better than the best Republican’. He did not support that claim. Whatever its value decades ago, my view is that the opposite is now the case. There is no Democrat I would vote for for any office.\n\nChris:\n\nIs it safe to say that you do not agree with Chomsky's political views?\n\nPaul:\n\nYou are kidding right? Of course, I don’t agree with him.\n\n2. Education\n\nChris:\n\nWhere did you go to college as an undergraduate? What year did you start? What was your major?\n\nPaul:\n\nColumbia, 1953-1957. Major: Philosophy, Anthropology\n\nChris:\n\nSince you got into Columbia as an undergraduate, you must have done well in high school.\n\nPaul:\n\nNo, not at all. I was a mediocre student. I got into Columbia because my sister got into Barnard, so I had a family connection.\n\nChris:\n\nHow did you end up choosing philosophy and anthropology as your majors at Columbia? Do you remember?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo.\n\nChris:\n\nWhen you were an undergraduate, did you take any courses that were in some way relevant to linguistics, like logic, perhaps, or something in anthropology?\n\nPaul:\n\nI took a logic course; but understood little. I can’t remember any anthropology course relevant to linguistics.\n\nChris:\n\nWere there any professors or courses that influenced you intellectually as an undergraduate? Anything that you recall that had a deep impact on your thinking?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo.\n\nChris:\n\nWhere did you go to graduate school? In what field? What were the dates (beginning and end)?\n\nPaul:\n\nYale, Department of Anthropology, 1957-1962/3. I left Yale in late spring 1961, finished my thesis in 1962 but too late to meet the submission deadline. So, the Ph.D. was not awarded until 1963.\n\nChris:\n\nWhen did you first meet Jay Keyser?\n\n[C.C., Jay Keyser was a graduate student in the Department of Linguistics at Yale from 1958-62.]\n\nPaul:\n\nI think fall of 1957, maybe 1958.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you discuss linguistics with him at Yale?\n\nPaul:\n\nHardly if at all. We were at different life stages. He was already married, and living off campus I think in a rented house. He was not much around campus. I lived in campus housing, campus dining hall, etc. Also, our interests did not overlap. He was in phonology, history of English.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you ever take courses together at Yale?\n\nPaul:\n\nNot that I remember.\n\nChris:\n\nJay says he was in Bloch's class with you.\n\nPaul:\n\nPossible…I have no memory of it\n\nChris:\n\nDid you influence each other's thinking about generative syntax while at Yale?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo.\n\nChris:\n\nDid any of your other fellow students at Yale go on to become generative linguists?\n\nPaul:\n\nI don’t think so. Recall I was in anthropology department. No one else there was interested in linguistics as far as I remember. Well, actually the question is vague. I knew students who were in the linguistics department, and some of them became professional linguists. Not sure about the ‘generative’.\n\nChris:\n\nJay sent me this list, but it is only for Linguistics, not Anthropology. Lounsbury [C.C., Paul’s dissertation advisor] is on it several times. So is Jay. I thought you might be interested. Do you recognize any of the names on the list from 61-63?\n\nPaul:\n\nSure. But the astounding thing is that starting from the most recent people, one has to go back to 1974 to find someone I have heard of, Marianne Mithun, although I never knew her. Then from 1971, I of course knew and even did a bit of work with Jorge Hankamer. I have heard of Sarah Thomason from 1968, but again had nothing to do with her. Frederick Damereau from 66 is interesting. I did not even realize he had a Yale Ph. D, or if I did, I forgot. Anyway, he worked in the real part of IBM, the business part, I forget which division, for many years, then came to Research, and became a member of the linguistics group. He never did anything you or I would regard as linguistic, but he was smart, did programming type stuff, some thinking about machine translation and then worked on the group question answering system. He was very helpful to me understanding the computer system there when we were all assigned terminals in 1979. Also, I learned a lot from him about how IBM worked. He kept his habits from the business area, knew what things cost, how the regulations worked, always wore a white shirt and a tie, etc., pretty rare except for managers in Research.\n\nI knew Percival, an English guy from Leeds; we lived in the Hall of Graduate Studies at same time. I was friendly with Alan Stevens during a period at Yale. I remember he came to visit me for a day or two when I was living in Montreal working on Mohawk, in 1960. We socialized a bit after that but I haven’t heard from or about him in decades and have no idea whether he is alive.\n\nIt is normal for people my age to be dead, especially males, as Edgar Gregersen illustrates. He was a fellow anthropology student at Yale and died quite recently although he was slightly younger than I am.\n\nThe fact that Noam Chomsky is alive at soon to be 92 is beyond amazing. Of course, I knew and know Jay Keyser. Other names from that period I have some memories about but they are not people I had anything much to do with.\n\nIn the picture, the only person I recognize is Larry Horn.\n\n[C.C.,\n\n1964 Alan M. Stevens A grammar of Madurese\n\n1964 W. Keith Percival A grammar of Toba-Batak\n\n1966 Frederick J. Damerau Empirical investigation of statistically generated sentences]\n\n[C.C., Edgar Gregersen’s NYTs obituary can be found here:\n\nChris:\n\nWhat was the title of your thesis?\n\nPaul:\n\nSome Syntactic Rules in Mohawk\n\nChris:\n\nWho directed your thesis?\n\nPaul:\n\nWell technically a gentleman named Floyd Lounsbury. But in fact, I directed it. Did I not tell you that when I handed it in he wrote me a letter saying he was too busy with his ‘work’ to read it for two years. I am sure he never read it. And certainly, he never sent me any reactions. This seems like a joke today but it was not.\n\n[C.C., Wikipedia entry on Floyd Lounsbury:\n\n[C.C., Anthropology Tree entry for Floyd Lounsbury:\n\n[C.C., the acknowledgments from Paul’s thesis:\n\n“ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI am indebted to Floyd G. Lounsbury for introducing me to the Iroquoian languages and for many hours of discussion of the complexities of their grammars. I have also profited greatly from his published study of Oneida which has served as a foundation of my understanding of Iroquoian verb structure even when I have been forced to disagree with some of its theoretical implications. To Noam Chomsky I owe my conception of linguistic description as well as thanks for long hours of discussion of the theoretical intricacies of the formal grammatical devices used in this work. I have benefited greatly from extended conversations on Mohawk syntax with G. H. Matthews. In particular, the treatment of incorporation and possessive constructions in this dissertation owes much to his suggestions. I am grateful to Morris Halle for my notions of phonological structure which underly the transcription in the present study as well as for many helpful comments on the manuscript. To my wife I owe a debt of gratitude for aid in preparation of the final manuscript as well as for innumerable aids of a more abstract sort without which its completion would have been impossible. Finally, and most importantly I must thank my Mohawk informants, in particular Mrs. Thomas Lahache of Caughnawaga, Quebec, and Mrs. Margaret Lahache of Brooklyn, New York, for their continuously cheerful cooperation which did not stop at occasionally apologizing for some of the amazing complications of their native tongue.”]\n\nChris:\n\nWhy did you choose him to direct your thesis? Or was he assigned to you?\n\nPaul:\n\nHe was the linguist in the anthropology department and an Iroquoianist. I can’t imagine any question of choosing arose.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you ever have meetings with him when you were working on your thesis?\n\nPaul:\n\nMaybe I talked to him a couple of times but in an unorganized way. I was thinking in TG terms and he didn’t know anything about that and didn’t like the movement.\n\nChris:\n\nSo, it is safe to say that he did not influence you intellectually. Right?\n\nPaul:\n\nRight.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat framework were you using to do your thesis analyses?\n\nPaul:\n\nTG\n\nChris:\n\nWhen you say TG, I assume you mean Transformational Grammar. Which books and papers on TG seemed most useful to you at the time in writing your thesis?\n\nPaul:\n\nThere wasn’t much. Anything of Chomsky’s or Robert Lees’ I could get my hands on. I remember getting Lees’ nominalization book while I was in Canada gathering data in 1960. I have no specific memories beyond that. I can scan relevant parts of thesis bibliography if you really care.\n\nChris:\n\nWhen did you first learn about TG? How did it happen?\n\nPaul:\n\nNot sure, probably from Robert Lees’ review of ‘Syntactic Structures’ in LANGUAGE.\n\nChris\n\nDid you take any linguistics classes at Yale in graduate school? Either in TG or in another framework?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, I took one class from Bernard Bloch, then editor of LANGUAGE. He was a traditional scholar and I guess a structuralist of the time. The class was awful. He spent enormous amount of time on the various allomorphs of English plurals, and gave a penny reward to anyone who discovered a new one. Edgar Gregersen found one. That is my total memory of the class. Maybe I took a class from someone else, I think it was Rulon Wells. No memory of the content.\n\nChris:\n\nWas this before or after you learned about TG?\n\nPaul:\n\nProbably more or less simultaneous.\n\nChris:\n\nI am embarrassed to say that I have not read your thesis, even though you sent me the physical book. Can you summarize what it was about? I read somewhere that you proposed something like the unaccusative hypothesis there. Is that true?\n\nPaul:\n\nIt is true that I had an unaccusative analysis, it was almost self-evident. Mohawk has rich noun incorporation, with transitive direct objects incorporating. But also, a subset of intransitives incorporate. So, in the rules I proposed the one argument NP of the intransitives which incorporated originated as a direct object. Pullum published one of his NLLT pieces about the origin of the idea, finding many sources. He cites my letter to Perlmutter, explaining the idea. Perlmutter later published (with my ok) a paper expounding it. Since then the field attributes its origin to him, I don’t think I am ever mentioned except for Pullum’s piece.\n\nThe thesis was about handling pronominal agreement (rich system for subjects and objects), possessor nominals, incorporation, broad covertness of nominals, etc.\n\nIncidentally, the following talk I gave at NYU in 2004 might be of relevance:\n\nChris:\n\nThanks for the NYU talk. That is very useful for this interview.\n\nDo you still have a copy of the letter to Perlmutter that you could send me as a scan?\n\nPostal:\n\nI don’t have an original copy of my letter to Perlmutter, but Pullum reproduced it in full in his 1988 article in NLLT on the history of unaccusative ideas. Incidentally, he is author of term. It is attached.\n\nChris:\n\nOther than the unaccusative analysis, were there any other discoveries in your thesis that have been important to you, or that have been significant for syntactic theory?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, I was permanently struck in my work on Mohawk syntax by the fact that a good bit of syntactic structure is phonologically invisible.\n\nA typical Mohawk sentence consists of one or more complex verbs, with pronominal prefixes, negative prefixes, tense and aspect suffixes, etc. with some particles thrown in. There are lots of sentences of roughly the following form, where brackets surround verbs:\n\nNote that the orthography of my thesis was a morphophonemic one, which I developed. No Iroquoianist ever adopted it. The usual orthographies are much more phonetic and mark stuff I claimed was predictable.\n\nFrom page 368:\n\n(1) i?i [khnurnuhwe?s] nehneh [kahurhu?syi] ‘I like the black gun’\n\nIt consists of four words:\n\ni?i = ‘I’\n\nkhnurnuhwe?s = [1stPsing-gun-like-suffix]\n\nnehneh = particle\n\n[kahurhu?syi] = [3Psing-gun-black-suffix]\n\nThe second and fourth word are verbs; the language does not distinguish adjective/verb the way English does.\n\nWhen I first tried to think about sentences like (1), I was baffled. First of all, each verb has an incorporated noun (stem), the same one in this case, the noun stem meaning ‘gun’. The phenomenon of incorporation is characteristic of the language, as with many others in North America. But Mohawk has a feature which many do not, namely, that the incorporated noun stem in many cases can cooccur with an external noun based on the same stem, as in:\n\nFrom page 291\n\n(2) kanuhsaragv thikv kanuhsa (the ‘v’ symbol here should be upside down, to represent a nasal vowel, but I don’t know how to get that character) ‘that house is white’\n\nThis consists of a verb with incorporated noun ‘house’ nuhs meaning ‘house is white’, a form meaning ‘that’ and an external noun based on the same noun stem. The language has some nouns like that which occur verb externally, but really quite few in comparison to European languages. Lots of semantic equivalents of our nouns are verbs, e.g. ’table’ is a verbal form ‘one puts one’s food on it’, etc. Pronouns for first, second, third person are usually null, indicated by verbal agreement, for both subjects and objects. In a case like (2), the last two words could be omitted yielding a sentence just meaning ‘it is white’.\n\nAfter a long period of bafflement, it dawned on me that cases like the last verb in example (1) could be taken to represent a relative clause (bracketed <…>) with a null ‘head’. So, it was really, I concluded, something like:\n\nI […gun like] gun particle <gun [..gun black]>\n\nThe idea was that each clause had its own original noun, hence the possibility of incorporation in both clauses. Then the external noun sources of the incorporated nouns would be deleted. Today I would posit only a single noun shared by the two clauses, but I had no idea like that in 1960. The relative clause view obviously depended on a good bit of syntactic deletion, as did any general treatment of incorporation of cases like the shortened form of (2).\n\nFrom the point when I began to develop concrete ideas about the treatment of incorporation and especially the cases I took to represent relative clauses, I could never take seriously any view of syntax which sort of viewed it as some variant of a direct analysis of the visible morphemes. This\n\nmade the newly available ideas of the transformational grammar of the time seem extremely attractive as they entirely lacked any commitment which blocked the sort of deletions I took to be required to describe Mohawk.\n\nIncidentally, I found another personal talk I gave at NYU; it is attached.\n\nChris:\n\nHow did you decide to write a thesis on Mohawk syntax? What led up to that decision? Both the fact that the thesis was on Mohawk and the fact that the thesis was on syntax.\n\nPaul:\n\nI was in an anthropology department. A thesis had to be based on work with traditional sources, that is, pretty much nonwestern cultures. I did not wish to and did not have resources to go to some third world local. I lived on Long Island, and there were Mohawks in Brooklyn. Floyd Lounsbury, the linguist in the Anthropology department, was an Iroquoianist. He knew the name of someone in Brooklyn who connected me with a Mohawk in Brooklyn.\n\nI don’t remember how I decided to do syntax, probably because I had seen enough of TG to be interested.\n\nBut I can add one thing I am very proud of. Lounsbury had another student after me named Nancy Bonvillain. She wrote a thesis on Mohawk, having worked on a different reservation. In it she has a statement that she did not consult my work, a kind of negative citation. I have never seen anything like that before or after. I took it as a kind of underhanded criticism, as saying my work\n\nwas not even worth looking at. But of course, her statement gave no evidence for that.\n\n[C.C., The citation Paul refers to by Nancy Bonvillain might be the only negative citation in the history of linguistics. The relevant reference to Bonvillian is from her thesis:\n\nBonvillain, Nancy. 1973. A Grammar of Akwesasne Mohawk. University of Ottawa Press.\n\nIn chapter 1 (pg. 12, footnote 6), she says:\n\n“The work of Paul Postal (see bibliography) was not consulted as the basis for this grammar.”\n\nIn the bibliography she lists two references:\n\nPostal, Paul. “Mohawk Vowel Doubling” in IJAL vol. 35, 1969.\n\nPostal, Paul. Some Syntactic Rules in Mohawk. New Haven: unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Yale University, 1964.]\n\n[C.C., links on Nancy Bonvillain:\n\nChris:\n\nI put in those links (to Gregersen, Bonvillain, Lounsbury) to show the academic context that you emerged from, and the kinds of things you were expected to do coming from that department at Yale. It is really quite amazing that you made the transition to TG, given that context. Do you have any thoughts about that?\n\nPaul:\n\nLinguistically, as soon as I heard about TG, generative grammar, that was my intellectual context. I had nothing to do with anything linguistic in the department, except since I planned to work on Mohawk, I had a bit of relation to Lounsbury. But our relations were limited and purely dealt with Iroquoian details. Once I started actually writing my thesis, which really only took place after I was at MIT, I had no relation with him at all. He knew nothing about TG and didn’t like it much.\n\n3. MIT (1961-1965) and CUNY (1965-1967)\n\nChris:\n\nWhat was your first job after graduate school? What year did it start?\n\nPaul:\n\nI was a research associate at MIT, research laboratory of electronics. It started in July, 1961, I think.\n\nChris:\n\nHow did you get that job?\n\nPaul:\n\nMy memories are vague. Chomsky came to Yale while I was there and gave a talk on the work he and Halle were doing on English stress. I did not meet him. But I was working for some reason on a paper about simplicity in phonology and ultimately sent it to Morris Halle. He invited me to come to MIT for a visit, which I did. I don’t remember anything much about the visit, but I guess that is how I was offered the job.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat did you do as a “research associate”? Are there any important events from that period that you can recall?\n\nPaul:\n\nI worked on my thesis. Important events…no. I met various people, Ed Klima, Hu Matthews, Bob Lees, Chomsky, Jerry Katz, and became aware of how little I knew of anything relevant along endless parameters. Basically, nothing I had done before really helped me much.\n\nChris:\n\nIt sounds like a wonderful environment. Is there anybody in particular who you discussed syntax or phonology with at this time at MIT?\n\nPaul:\n\nIf I recall, at that early point, the person I talked to most was Hu Matthews, who had worked on an Amerindian language, Hidatsa. But I don’t remember any content. I rarely talked to Chomsky much throughout my stay at MIT. I had a lot of contact with Halle, because I was interested in Mohawk phonology. I remember one day he took me to talk to Roman Jakobson, who was visiting. There was some problem in Iroquoian phonology and Halle seemed to want to know what Jacobson thought about it. When the problem was described to him, I forget what it was, Jacobson said ‘it was just like Oneida’ (which he pronounced [onida]), which was true. Oneida is a sister to Mohawk, and Mohawks will say of Oneidas that ’they speak our language’, although the phonologies are very different. Unfortunately, that provided zero solution so the whole visit was a waste of time.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you take any classes at MIT during this period? Do you have any memories of them?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo, I took no classes. I attended one class of Chomsky’s one afternoon. I found it of little interest; he proposed some ad hoc indexing thing for relative clauses, which I found totally unpersuasive and never went again.\n\nChris:\n\nWhere did you go after your research associate position at MIT?\n\nPaul:\n\nTo the City University of New York. I was mostly at Queens College but also, at least pretty soon, was associated with the Graduate Center in Manhattan. I stayed there for two years. Then I went to the IBM Research Center, in Yorktown Heights, New York, about 40 miles north of Manhattan.\n\nChris:\n\nWait, I think we skipped a few steps. Your CV says that after your research associate position, you became an assistant professor at the MIT Department of Modern languages from 9/63 until 9/65. Presumably you taught during this time. What did you teach?\n\nPaul:\n\nI think I taught one course on the pre-generative linguistics of the time and one on English syntax, about which I knew almost nothing. But my memories of all that are vague.\n\nChris:\n\nIs it during that period, when you were an assistant professor at MIT, that you met Haj?\n\nPaul:\n\nToo precise. I met him after the Ph.D. program began and students showed up. It was probably 1963 but I am not sure.\n\nChris:\n\nI don't know what year Haj started his graduate education at MIT, but his degree was awarded in 1967, so I figured you two overlapped at MIT.\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, this is not in question, but the precise date is unclear.\n\nChris:\n\nDuring this period, you must have also met McCawley and Langendoen, who you later wrote a book with. Is that right?\n\n[C.C., here is a list of MIT alumni with years of graduation\n\nPaul:\n\nRight, but I have almost no memory of McCawley at that period. My only memories of him in person are some hallway conversations at meetings in later years.\n\nChris:\n\nI have a feeling that this time must have been important to you intellectually. You were no longer writing your thesis (which was finished when you were a research associate). You were teaching a set of very smart students. What kinds of topics were you thinking about? Do any of them foreshadow major themes in your career?\n\nPaul:\n\nWell, I wrote my monograph ‘Constituent Structure’, which was a criticism of nongenerative ideas, and raising to object started with a student named Peter Rosenbaum, who later went to IBM and was the driving force in getting me hired there. But I didn’t start thinking much about it until Chomsky got his bizarre idea that there was no such thing.\n\n[C.C., a link to the book ‘Constituent Structure’:\n\nChris:\n\nDo you mean that the idea for the rule of raising to object is due to Peter Rosenbaum?\n\nPaul:\n\nI believe so but not sure. One would have to look at his thesis, which I don’t have. Maybe I specify in ‘On Raising’. I will look later.\n\nChris:\n\nYes, please check. It is interesting to know the origin of ideas.\n\nPaul:\n\nI looked briefly in ‘On Raising’. It is pretty clear from pages 5-10 that the raising to object idea was indeed Rosenbaum’s.\n\nChris:\n\nAs for your monograph ‘Constituent Structure’, I have not read it. Why did you decide to write a whole monograph on that topic?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo idea.\n\nChris:\n\nCould you summarize it for me?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo, I hardly remember it.\n\nChris:\n\nWhy did you leave MIT in 1965? It seems that being an assistant professor at MIT would have been a pretty sweet deal. You were in the middle of the intellectual excitement with lots of smart students.\n\nPaul:\n\nVarious reasons. I never viewed living in New England, with its distinctive culture as permanent. My whole family and previous acquaintances were in New York. Probably in some sense I did not like the developing culture at MIT, where Chomsky played an outsized role and where any idea of his rapidly became taken as something super important. But perhaps I am building future reactions into that early decision.\n\nChris:\n\nYour CV says you spent 6/64 to 8/64 (three months) as an assistant professor at Indiana University. Did you live in Indiana and teach?\n\nPaul:\n\nIt was an LSA summer school. It was nothing like three months, maybe 6 weeks. Of course, I lived there. I taught two courses, one on Mohawk phonology, the other on transformational syntax.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you get to meet anybody there who you exchanged interesting ideas with, or learned interesting things from?\n\nPaul:\n\nKen Hale. I spent a lot of time with him. That is why I recommended him as my replacement when I left MIT.\n\nChris:\n\nHe must have been quite interested in your work on Mohawk. What did you guys talk about?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, I remember him attending the Mohawk class. But no memory of 56 year old discussions.\n\nChris:\n\nYou mentioned you wrote a letter of recommendation for Ken Hale to MIT. Do you still have a copy of that letter?\n\nPaul:\n\nI didn’t say that. I said I recommended him. I suspect it was purely verbal to Morris Halle personally, before I left MIT.\n\nChris:\n\nBy the way, I thought that bringing Ken Hale to MIT was a very smart move. It opened up a whole new world to them of cross-linguistic research, on all the languages that Ken was interested in, including Native American languages but also Australian Indigenous languages. He was my advisor at MIT for my 1993 Ph.D. thesis.\n\nDo you have any thoughts about this?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, I totally agree. That was my motivation for recommending him, besides his obvious great qualifications. The attitude in the Department was very much focused on European languages. When I met Klima he made disparaging remarks about ‘gook’ languages. This despite the fact that Matthews had worked on Hidatsa. When I gave a talk at MIT on Mohawk, there were a certain number of condescending jokes. This was kind of weird. Chomsky had of course worked on Hebrew. Anyway, I guess establishing Ken there got rid of all that kind of thing.\n\nChris:\n\nWhen you were at MIT, did you have much interaction with Klima? Was his office next to yours? Was he teaching there at the same time as you? You and I know his negation article quite well. It is brilliant and groundbreaking. One of the most important articles ever written on negation.\n\nPaul:\n\nNo, I don’t recall having any interaction with Klima at all. I don’t know where his office was. I never recall seeing him, eating lunch with him, etc. But he was there.\n\nChris:\n\nHow about Noam? During the time you taught at MIT as an assistant professor, did you interact with him? Did you talk about research projects? Syntax? Plan courses? Did you go to his lectures? Did he come to your lectures? Did you visit him at home and shoot the breeze about syntax?\n\nPaul:\n\nBasic answer to all these questions is no. I had little to do with him. He was always busy, there were always other people hanging around in his office; it was hard to have a private conversation with him. I told you I attended one day’s class of his. He never attended any of mine; I am sure the idea never passed through his head. Why would it have? I was never in his home. I once had a party for people in the department in my apartment and he and his wife came.\n\nChris:\n\nYour book with Katz appeared in 1964 (‘An Integrated Theory of Linguistic Descriptions’) while you were still at MIT. I want to go into that a little. That book, I have read (or at least parts of it). Could you summarize for our readers what the book is about?\n\nPaul:\n\nNot really. I don’t remember much about it and haven’t had any interest in it for decades. All I remember is this. Chomsky’s TG had no semantics of any kind. Katz and Fodor developed a kind of semantics and published it in 1963. Katz and I tried to concoct a view which permitted a Katz/Fodor semantics to combine with a generative TG. A basic idea was that transformations had no effect on meanings. You can see echoes of that view in the APG [C.C., Arc Pair Grammar] book. Chomsky seemed to adopt elements of our view for a while; you can see it in his Aspects. There, in my opinion, he improved the framework greatly by eliminating the notion of generalized transformation, which were mappings which combined separate trees into single ones. Rather a single tree, called a deep structure, was generated by the base rules and that is what could be interpreted by the type of semantic rules Katz and Fodor had introduced.\n\nBut ultimately, Chomsky strangely abandoned the deep structure concept and went back to something like his original generalized transformation idea (in his minimalist program). Of course, he has never had any serious idea about semantics of any kind, so the semantic consequences of his ideas have never loomed large for him. Basically, Katz was responsible for all the semantics in our book while I wrote most of the syntactic stuff.\n\nChris:\n\nIs this the famous Katz-Postal Hypothesis (henceforth, KPH)? Could you state that hypothesis for me?\n\nPaul:\n\nI think it was just the idea that base structures were interpreted (I guess those were the output of phrase structure rules + lexicon) and that transformations had no effect.\n\nChris:\n\nCan you outline a single concrete analysis which at the time was motivated by the KPH? I want to give our readers a feel for the hypothesis.\n\nPaul:\n\nI just can’t think of how that hypothesis could motivate a concrete analysis. It just said that if e.g. something was a topicalized sentence, it had the same meaning as one minus the topicalization, ditto for passives. But it didn’t say anything about how to analyze passives. It was taken later by critics to be falsified by things like (1) having different scope possibilities than (2).\n\n(1) Every student studied no foreign language.\n\n(2) No foreign language was studied by every student.\n\nBut of course, one modern view could have different underlying quantifier DPs in different scope positions and thus even in a TG variant, the sentences would not differ just in transformational relations.\n\nChris:\n\nBut isn't it the case that May's theory of quantifier scope would be incompatible with KPH, because the quantifier DP moves to different scope positions resulting in different interpretations?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, for sure. I was going to mention that; but of course, I would never do scope via raisings. When I get some energy if ever, I will describe how I think the range of scopes we cover could be handled.\n\nChris:\n\nI know that APG (Arc Pair Grammar) does not have deep structure and transformations, but do you believe that something like the KPH holds?\n\nPaul:\n\nWell in that framework, the claim was (though no real semantics was spelled out) that the original structures, defined by self-sponsoring arcs, but equivalently by unsponsored arcs, determined meaning. So that is the closest analog of the KP claim.\n\nChris:\n\nSo as of today, you believe that something like the KPH holds. Right?\n\nPaul:\n\nThat’s true, but I have never given any real evidence for such a view and have never done any serious semantics to support it. It just has always seemed to me to be a conceptually lovely way to look at things.\n\nChris:\n\nPersonally, I think that the idea that scope positions are underlying positions is interesting, and should be taken seriously. So, the idea is that the DP is underlyingly in its scope position (not moved there), and is simply not spelled out there, but is rather spelled out in its variable position.\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, spelled out in ONE of its variable positions. For me, that is going to involve lowering of the Q determiner to the appropriate variable position DP, since only NPs originate in variable positions. This eliminates the need for the ad hoc principle which says a quantifier DP in such a position is interpreted as a variable, which to me is entirely bizarre. The lowering will do the work that the claim that scope position DPs are covert does.\n\nChris:\n\nHow and when did you meet Jerrold Katz? Did you call him Jerrold or Jerry?\n\nPaul:\n\nJerry…everyone called him that. I met him at MIT, but I really have no memory of when, where or what the circumstances were. It must have had something to do with Jay Keyser, who was a contemporary of mine at Yale. We both came to MIT at the same time and had cubby holes next to each other in the infamous Building 20. I believe he knew Katz earlier; they were both from Washington (DC). That must have been the connection.\n\nChris:\n\nSo, the work on Katz and Postal 1964 was done when you were at MIT. As you said, Katz worked out the semantics, and you did the syntax. What was it like working with Katz?\n\nPaul:\n\nDifficult. He had a very strong personality and once he formulated an idea it was very difficult to lead him away from it. There were many disagreements but I have no memory of what they were.\n\nChris:\n\nDid you work in your office at MIT, in cafes, at home, by phone, by mail?\n\nPaul:\n\nWe worked in his office as I recall, because he had the latest high-tech word-processing equipment of the time, an IBM Selectric typewriter with no ribbon but a kind of ball with type on it. It seemed really cool at the time.\n\nChris:\n\nHow did it go?\n\nPaul:\n\nAs I said difficult. We would often argue about who would formulate a particular idea or passage, which involved a discussion of who would sit at the typewriter. Since it was his office and typewriter, he usually won. The whole thing seems comical in retrospect and probably did at the time as well.\n\nChris:\n\nHow long did it take to write the book together? Just fill me in on the process a bit.\n\nPaul:\n\nI don’t remember how long. I would guess six months. It would have to have been after he finished the semantics article with Fodor, and done in time to have been published in 1964.\n\nI have written to Jay Keyser to see if he has any memories about my meeting Katz.\n\nChris:\n\nI cite Katz and Postal because of its use of various empty elements. For example, as I recall, it had null prepositions.\n\nI think that the use of empty elements in Katz and Postal 1964 is very significant for understanding the syntax/semantics interface.\n\nChris:\n\nDid Katz work at MIT when you were an assistant professor at MIT? Was he in the same department as the Chomsky and Halle? If not, where was he working?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, we overlapped the whole time I was there. He was in Philosophy Department. Later I think that and Linguistics became one. Keyser would know about that.\n\nChris:\n\nOK, so then you went to Queens College and the Graduate Center (both in NYC). Were there any linguists there at the time? I guess this was before Ray Dougherty was at NYU.\n\nPaul:\n\nI don’t think there were any at Queens then. There must have been somebody at the Graduate Center, but I have no memory.\n\nChris:\n\nWhat courses did you teach then at Queens College and the Graduate Center?\n\nPaul:\n\nI think at Queens it was English grammar. Not sure at the Graduate Center, probably something on linguistic theory, whatever I took that to be.\n\nChris:\n\nAlso, what kind of research were you doing at Queens College/Graduate Center? What projects were you thinking about?\n\nPaul:\n\nI can’t remember anything. I think the period between the end of the MIT spring semester in 1965 and the beginning of 1968 was linguistics-wise kind of a lost period. During that period, I left MIT, moved to Queens New York and took a job at the City University of New York, my wife had a baby, I changed jobs again to IBM, moved again to Westchester county New York. I can’t think of anything positive I accomplished linguistically during that period. I only began to get what I considered results when I began work on crossover phenomena (probably) in early 1968. Maybe I started work on pronominalization more generally sometime in 1966-67, but I have no memories and it didn’t yield anything much.\n\nWith respect to the period 1965-1967 in the interview, about which I said I didn’t accomplish much of anything linguistically, I amazingly forgot to mention one important factor. In 1966, December I think, my then wife had a miscarriage at 6 months of twin girls. She reacted terribly to the loss and was depressed for a long time, with consequences you can imagine. So along with two moves, a new job, a live baby, there was also this in that period.\n\nChris:\n\nI don't think I have done a good job getting you to talk about what the early days of generative grammar were like. What it was like to be part of a field transitioning from the older system (represented by your professors at Yale)?\n\nPaul:\n\nI do not have strong memories of this period. But for me there was no real transitioning, since I never really internalized the idea systems of the pre-Chomskyan American linguists of the time, and I was ignorant of European ones.\n\nTo understand the period of the introduction of generative grammar into American linguistics, one has to understand the existing situation. Ironically, this was itself the result of something of a revolution, whereby supposedly scientific structural/descriptive linguistics for the most part replaced more traditional grammatical ideas in the very few linguistic departments there were at that time. The newly established figures made no secret of their feeling of superiority with respect to previous views, a superiority based on their supposed rigor and scientific validity.\n\nSo when a new generation of linguists arrived, specifically people like Chomsky (30 in 1958), Morris Halle (35 that year), Robert Lees (36 that year), me (22 that year), and began claiming that generative grammar was the way to go and that the so-called successful scientific revolution of the descriptivists in fact had little to offer and was full of errors and lack of insight, it is easy to imagine the horrified reaction of the relatively newly dominant figures, then seeing themselves being pushed toward intellectual oblivion. And I think there was a considerable amount of immature behavior on the part of the generative cadre for a number of years, displays of arrogance, put downs, boasting and similar foolishness. Harris captures some of this in his ‘Linguistic Wars', even if he exaggerates.\n\nThere was, I believe, much feeling initially of fighting a battle with entrenched forces. But it wasn’t much of a battle for long, at least in syntax, where the in-place linguists had few ideas and rather superficial and limited ones at that. There was probably much more fighting in phonology, with the key issue being the kind of close to phonetics phonological representations then in vogue versus the partially morphophonemic representations advocated by Chomsky and Halle. Based on my work on Mohawk phonology, I wrote two papers and one book on these topics ('Aspects of Phonological Theory’1968). I have not thought seriously about phonology since 1969 so my memories are vague and I have no sense of how the field has developed since then.\n\nIt has often been remarked that generative linguistics got a huge boost from the government education financing bonanza which resulted from the shocked reaction to the Soviet launching of Sputnik. A lot of money was made available for language study and linguistics was able to get hold of a lot. New departments and Ph.D. programs were started, including most famously that at MIT, which I believe began in 1963 and which I taught in for two years, although what I knew to teach was laughably limited.\n\nChris:\n\nI don’t plan to ask you questions about generative semantics and the “Linguistic Wars” since the topic has already been covered by two books. But I did want to get your feedback on a quote describing you from the book ‘Linguistic Wars’ by Randy Allen Harris:\n\n(pg. 72) “Postal was even less loved by the Bloomfieldians. Like Lees, he is warm and genial in personal settings, and quite tolerant of opposing viewpoints. But his reputation for intellectual savagery is well-deserved, rooted firmly in his public demeanor at conferences, especially in the early years. The stories are legion, most of which follow the same scenario. Postal sits through some anonymous, relatively innocuous, descriptive paper cataloguing the phonemic system of a little-known language. He stands up, begins with a blast like ‘this paper has absolutely nothing to do with the study of human languages,’ and proceeds to offer a barrage of arguments detailing its worthlessness - often making upwards of a dozen distinct counter-arguments against both the specific data used and the framework it is couched in. The performances were renowned for both intellectual precision and rhetorical viciousness.”\n\nWhat do you think of it?\n\nPaul:\n\nFirst, I appreciated the line ‘Like Lees……’. It seems accurate to me. Second, talk of ‘intellectual savagery’ is way over the top. As is the later ‘rhetorical viciousness’. No doubt I was very critical. But the whole thing is extremely exaggerated because during the period in question I attended at most two or three meetings of the type at issue and, I am pretty sure, spoke publicly during at most two. I did not like at all that the passage is based on opinions from unnamed sources about unnamed conferences at unspecified dates and my supposed criticisms of unnamed talks by unnamed people. This is not the way history should be written. I protested on these points to Harris, telling him he should cite the people, etc. who he claims told him these things or eliminate the passage. But he refused.\n\n5. IBM (1967 – 1993)\n\nChris:\n\nWhy did you decide to leave Queens College/Graduate Center, and how did you get the job at IBM?\n\nPaul:\n\nI basically told you this. Peter Rosenbaum went to IBM about same time I left MIT or maybe a bit later. He wanted me to come there and persuaded whoever to hire me. I decided to go because of financial security and because there was zero interest at Queens College and not much at Graduate Center at that point. But mostly IBM Research Center was a linguistic desert for most of the time I was there. So, I got money and ability to mostly do whatever research I wanted but no stimulation. Rosenbaum left fairly soon after I was hired; I think he had some dream of starting his own company. I lost track of him and have not heard from or about him again.\n\n[C.C., Rosenbaum is now an academic editor:\n\nChris:\n\nSo, you started at IBM in 1967, what was your starting salary?\n\nPaul:\n\n$22 thousand. According to the inflation calculator I looked at, that is around $170 thousand in 2020 dollars. Nice salary for a 31year old, no?\n\nChris:\n\nYes, it is great. Really great. It gave you lots of freedom, and allowed you to do what you wanted.\n\nPaul:\n\nYeah, it was a lot of money. Note though it was a 50 week salary, as starting employees got two weeks vacation, where university people get at least three months.\n\nChris:\n\nIn comparison, do you remember the salaries for either CUNY or for MIT when you worked there?\n\nPaul:\n\nI started at MIT at $6500; when I became a professor, it was $9000, but we got 2k more if we didn’t vanish in the summer. At CUNY I started at 12k or 12.5k; but I soon got promoted, and then if I recall promoted again to full professor; (don’t ask me why, as I have pointed out I accomplished little or nothing while I was there). So, when I left CUNY my salary was 18k, already quite a lot.\n\nInterestingly, the 26 years I worked for IBM was a time of high inflation; my mother was at one point earning, I believe, 18 per cent on investments. Seems unbelievable today. So even though I got numerous raises, I recently calculated that my salary was less in buying power every year I was there, and that in 2020 dollars, it was worth $22,000 LESS in 1993 than in 1967. These calculations ignore the stock benefit employees had. We could buy IBM stock with a certain percentage of our salaries once a year at 15 per cent off the market price on the fixed date. Most of the time the stock went up in value. Ultimately, I sold it old and used the money to pay for my children’s college and some graduate school.\n\nChris:\n\nSo how did that work? Was IBM placing money on generative syntax? What department were you hired into? I just wonder what they thought the benefit to them would be of hiring a generative syntactician.\n\nPaul:\n\nI was hired in the Mathematical Sciences department. It had a primitive linguistics group which was mostly leftovers from an earlier Russian machine translation effort. For a company of the wealth of IBM at the time, the money involved in linguistics was miniscule. No doubt the publicity given to generative grammar played a role in expanding the group with Rosenbaum and me. The leftovers from the Russian effort were fairly soon dehired. No doubt dreams of machine translation played some role. These never died and the company spent lots of money on that and never achieved anything much. But they had a sound view that any applications/products in any area depended on underlying scientific research. And they understood further that most of the work in any field would be done by people outside the company and that they needed in house expertise to keep up with the work done elsewhere. I had a job status which was called a Research Staff Member, which was pretty high. Out of the 1200 people who originally worked in the center where I did, I think only about 300 were Research Staff Members.\n\nThey had a nice system such that every year or was it six months one had to file a report on what one had done. And there were different categories of accomplishment at that period which determined one’s salary increase if any. These included publications in scientific journals, patents, specific work leading to actual products, etc. My production usually looked good because of journal articles and books. Few people in the Mathematical Sciences ever published books, but I did, so I was outstanding in the whole department at times for book publications.\n\nChris:\n\nYour whole time at IBM is a black box to me. If you were at a university, I would know approximately what you did. But I cannot really imagine what it was like at IBM. I want to ask some questions about that.\n\nWhat percentage of your time was spent doing your own research (vs. IBM assigned tasks)? Did that percentage change over time? Other than your own research, what kind of projects were you involved in? What was your average day like at IBM? Where you able to have study leaves and sabbaticals? Who were the colleagues that you interacted with?\n\nPaul:\n\nOK. When I arrived at IBM there were no computers in offices; writing was done with typewriters, white out, cutting and pasting with scissors and tape, etc. Horrible. What I did was read journal articles, books (there was a library and they would buy some books), talk to people on the phone, communicate by letter. I would say over my whole period at IBM I spent 98-9 percent of my time doing what I wanted. But in the background was the yearly report. So, I had to publish things.\n\nAt one point the head of the Math Department began to pressure the group to do something practical…aim for a product. The decision was made to try to construct a question answering system which could answer formatted questions aimed at databases. I worked a small amount on constructing the grammar for the system. I remember nothing about its content. The work on the system went on for years, and when David Johnson finally got a full-time job there, it was to work on that system. Which never really developed into a usable product.\n\nSometime in the late 70s, computer terminals appeared in offices, those gray screen suckers with the green writing. But they connected to the main frame. There were no office printers (there never were while I worked there). If you wanted to print something, you had to send the file to the main printer room, which I recall was on main floor, we were on third. Later, much later, printers appeared in the halls, at least on the same floor. So, when work switched to terminals, I had to learn to use whatever the word processing system was. I can’t remember its name. It was not until 1986 that we got decent terminals, with color screens, but still just linked to the main frame.\n\nMost of the time I worked there, there was really no one to talk to about linguistics seriously. Susumu Kuno visited, I think for a year. David Johnson had a temporary job in late 70s, which is when we wrote APG. One semester I went on a sort of sabbatical to Rockefeller University; that is when John Grinder and I wrote our paper Missing Antecedents. Johnson came back as a permanent employee sometime in 80s but only to work on product development like the answering system. So, we could never do much of anything together.\n\nOf course, while the internet began around 1980 internal to IBM, that is, one could connect to other IBM locations, real internet was much later and really never much before I got terminated. I remember my first internet message. It just appeared on my screen. It was utterly mysterious to me how it appeared there. But it was sent from another IBM location, if I recall correctly in Australia.\n\nI also remember the first time I really used the system. It must have been in the early 80s. Pullum and I were working on something and he had moved from GB to Santa Cruz. There was an IBM location not too far from there. And somehow, I got in touch with somebody who worked there and arranged to send him the file and have him print it and leave it at the entrance desk where Pullum could pick it up. Complicated and primitive but it seemed REALLY cool at the time to be able to send an article not on paper across country in an instant.\n\nChris:\n\nWarren Plath appears in the acknowledgements of several of your papers. Who is he? Did you work with him?\n\nPaul:\n\nHe was the manager of the linguistics group the entire time of my presence at IBM. No, I never did anything with him which could be considered working together. He is the brother of famed suicide poetess Sylvia Plath, something he NEVER would talk about, not that I ever raised the topic.\n\nChris:\n\nWas he a linguist? You acknowledged him quite a bit in your papers, which makes me think you discussed linguistics with him often.\n\nPaul:\n\nYeah, I think he had a degree from Harvard. We discussed things only in context of my reports on what I was doing. He would read my writings and make editorial comments. It seems impossible to find out anything about him via Google because queries just return stuff about his sister, who is famous.\n\nChris:\n\nSo, you are not in contact with him any longer?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo, I haven’t seen him or heard from him since I left IBM. After that, I don’t remember when, I wrote him a message/letter thanking him for all of his many kindnesses and considerations during my residence there. But he never responded. I have no idea whether he is still alive. David Johnson probably knows more.\n\nChris:\n\nSee the following link. It says that Warren Plath has a 1964 dissertation from Harvard titled ‘Multiple-Path Syntactic Analysis of Russian’ directed by Anthony Gervin Oettinger.\n\nWhat was the name of your research group at IBM?\n\nPaul:\n\nLinguistics Group, part of Mathematical Sciences department, with many other groups, of real mathematicians.\n\nChris:\n\nThis book review written by Warren Plath gives more information about him at the end (on page 559):\n\n“Warren J. Plath is a research staff member, emeritus, at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, where he formerly served as manager of the Theoretical and Computational Linguistics Group. As a graduate student and later faculty member at Harvard in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was a member of the machine translation project under Anthony G. Oettinger, in which he worked on automatic parsing of Russian. At IBM in the mid-1960s he managed the transition from applied work on Russian-English MT using special-purpose machines to a broad program of research emphasizing linguistic theory, English grammar, and formal parsing systems implemented on general-purpose computers. His subsequent project and individual research included work on natural language question-answering, machine-aided translation, semantic grammars for spoken-language interfaces, and information extraction from news articles on the Web. Plath’s address is Mathematical Sciences Department, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, P.O. Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598-2103”\n\nPaul:\n\nGood find. That has more about Warren than I think I ever knew.\n\nChris:\n\nSo, can we say that Warren Plath was important to your work?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, you could say that but not in the sense you are thinking, I gather. He was not important in the way say that the people I have done joint work with have been, Katz, Haj, Perlmutter, Pullum, Langendoen, you. Warren was important in facilitating my relation to the Research Division and thus to the corporation. He was/is a very decent, conscientious, rigorous, disciplined person, not involved in corporate politics, not having as far as I can tell any real desire to rise in the management hierarchy. As far as our relations were concerned, his job was to take whatever reports I produced about my work and speak to his management about it (along with work by others in the group) in such a way as to justify our existence. He no doubt did a good job of that. But my existence really depended on my publications. I produced I think six books and one edited volume while I was there, with real publishers. This looked especially good because mathematicians don’t produce much in the way of books. I also published a constant stream of articles. That was my work product. Warren was also very unimaginative and a very rigid and uptight personality. For instance, every work day he was there he had a tuna fish sandwich for lunch unless there was some kind of off campus lunch. Thousands of tuna fish sandwiches.\n\nChris:\n\nDid he give you feedback on your work?\n\nPaul:\n\nBasically, editorial feedback.\n\nChris:\n\nBut did he also supervise your work?\n\nPaul:\n\nNot in any real sense.\n\nChris:\n\nDid he allow you freedom to do your research? Did he have that responsibility?\n\nPaul:\n\nNot much. By being a research staff member, I was primed to have that freedom. Of course, if he had had his own ideas, being my manager, he could no doubt have pressured me to work on lines he was interested in, but he had none. The only pressure I was ever subjected to was when the Mathematical Sciences director decided that the group should do something practical; this led to a project to develop a database answering system. Warren, David Johnson, Stan Petrick and several programmers worked on this for years. I did a tiny amount, sketching some ideas about how the syntax should work…but it looked good because Warren could always say and did that I was contributing to this project, the kind of thing management could understand.\n\nChris:\n\nDo you still have an example of the IBM yearly report?\n\nPaul:\n\nNo.\n\n’\n\n;\n\nChris:\n\nCounterfactually, if you had stayed in a department of linguistics (like CUNY or MIT), how would your career have been different? You might have published less, because you would have had less time. But you might also have had students and done teaching. You might have also had linguistics colleagues to collaborate with.\n\nI sometimes think that your position at IBM isolated you a bit from the field. In some ways, that could be positive (giving you more time and intellectual freedom), but in some ways it could be negative (isolating you, giving you less chance to interact with students and linguistics colleagues). Have you thought about these things?\n\nPaul:\n\nEverything you say is quite true. But who knows what the alternative world would have yielded except the obvious. Anyway, one makes choices and takes the consequences.\n\nChris:\n\nYou are basically an outsider in various ways. You worked at IBM instead of at a university.\n\nPaul:\n\nThis was quite crucial in many ways. Most academics have, I believe, no idea what a real corporation is like, the constraints they operate under. Full time (not adjunct) academics live a rather cushy life; the money that supports them is largely taken for granted. It comes from the government or from student fees which academics don’t have to worry about. They are in a sense a kind of welfare class. In a corporation,’ even in the rather far from the business side Research Division of IBM, money and profits are never far from consideration. It is always kept in mind that the company is competing with others, that it is subject to government controls, often unreasonable and corrupt. The threat of serious losses and financial disaster is never out of mind. And indeed, in late 1993, even an as huge and previously successful and dominant company as IBM came, due to terrible management decisions, to the brink of bankruptcy. This led to the elimination of essentially half of the work force, including me.\n\nMost information in corporations is subject to privacy and secrecy regulations, costs are closely monitored (everything from travel expenses to personal phone calls). It is a world very different from the university world. Lawyers play a very major role. The corporate world is widely misunderstood and hated by many academics, with extreme cases like Chomsky’s absurd claims that corporations are fascist organizations. Funny, all the time I worked at IBM, they didn’t arrest anyone.\n\nChris:\n\nIn addition to working at IBM, you started out in generative syntax, but then rebelled. You are a conservative, where academics are largely liberal (at least that is my impression). So, these things go together. Do you agree with this outsider characterization?\n\nPaul:\n\nAbsolutely. And it had both advantages (no group think) and disadvantages.\n\nChris:\n\nHow did you get “terminated” (your words) at IBM? Were they downsizing? Was it time for retirement?\n\nPaul:\n\nDue to massive mismanagement, in 1993 the company, which had been one of major corporations in the world for decades, was on the verge of bankruptcy. This was due to many factors, but crucially ignoring the coming role of small computers and downplaying the importance of software. This permitted Microsoft to come into existence, which never should have happened…and the whole Microsoft world should have been part of IBM. In the early 90s the company tooled up to have sales of 100 billion dollars per year. This involved scaling up employment role to 400,000. But they never reached 70 billion. Thus disaster, leading to offloading of half the work force worldwide, roughly 200,000 people.\n\nChris:\n\nOK, you were at IBM 26 years. How can we divide up that time for the purpose of this interview? Do you view the 26 years in different segments, based on the kinds of projects you were involved with?\n\nPaul:\n\nI never thought about such a division but I suppose one could do it in terms of books. There are too many articles to worry about. Keep in mind, as I always did, that there was the annual report to fill out. And since I wasn’t generating any patents, or products, etc. my work product was almost entirely publications.\n\nSo, I guess my first years were those when I worked on the crossover book and then on ‘On Raising’. These were conceived of in the TG terms of the period. The first was published in 1970, the second in 1974. But before the latter date, Perlmutter and I got into relational grammar. And this was my major activity until the APG book, published in 1980. That work was supposed to yield a giant volume covering all aspects of relational grammar, but it never got produced. Part of the reason was that Johnson and I started developing APG, which for us was just a way of trying to make relational grammar serious. This caused problems with Perlmutter, who felt I should not work on an APG book until after we did the relational grammar book. But for me, after the ideas got going, working on a non-APG version of relational grammar made no sense. And to the extent that I did that, yielding various papers published in the three volumes of ‘Studies in Relational Grammar’, it was out of a sense of duty.\n\nIndependently, Garland decided to publish my thesis in 1979. But that represented no new work. It did look good on my annual report though.\n\nAfter that, Terry Langendoen and I worked on ‘The Vastness of Natural Languages’, which appeared in 1984. That was a kind of isolated work and did not involve a lot of time. After that I sewed together various things and produced ‘Studies of Passive Clauses’, a cross-linguistic thing. Sometime around then I started working seriously on French. I got IBM to pay for an informant; I had two over time, both women, who came once a week or so over several years. This permitted writing ‘Masked Inversion in French’, published in 1989.\n\nSometime in late 80s I started working on extraction and anti-pronominal contexts, which yielded ‘Three Investigations of Extraction’, but not until five years after I left IBM.\n\nChris:\n\nOK, let me begin with ‘On Raising’ (1974). First, I must say I only read it a few years ago, and I loved it. It is one of my favorite syntax books. I loved how you took a single construction so seriously and turned it inside out.\n\nSo, one question I have is this: What motivated you to look at this construction so carefully? What is the background leading up to that? Is there some paper you read first? Why did you feel it was such an important topic to write a whole book about?\n\nPaul:\n\nThis is quite clear. To me the existence of raising to object seemed obvious. So, I was motivated and annoyed by Chomsky’s proposal that there was no such thing.\n\nChris:\n\nHow long did it take you to write?\n\nPaul:\n\nI don’t remember how long.\n\nChris:\n\nDo you remember where Chomsky proposed that? Was it ‘Conditions on Transformations’?\n\nPaul:\n\nLook on page 29 of ‘On Raising’, attached.\n\n[C.C., the quote from ‘On Raising’ is given below:\n\n“Chomsky (1972: 86) states, in criticizing an analysis of the word remind (Postal, 1970a), which made some appeal to Raising, the following: ‘... I might mention that the permutation rule that gives (25) as well as subject-raising [into object position-this phrase not present in the original circulated version] seem to me to be at best dubious rules.’ This formulation (without the added clarification) might well have been confusing to some, as it was to the present writer, who, in some circulated but unpublished arguments, took it to be a general rejection of the existence of a rule Raising. However, in an earlier personal communication as well as in the published version, the author has clarified his position, indicating that what he had in mind rather was only to call into question the existence of a raising operation in the case of what I am here calling B-verbs. That is, Chomsky does not question the existence of Raising for at least some A-verb constructions. Rejection of Raising for B-verb constructions is also briefly alluded to in Chomsky (1971) and sketched in greater detail in Chomsky (to appear) [C.C., ‘Conditions on Transformations’].”\n\nChris:\n\nDo you remember how people reacted to your book once it was published? Did it generate useful debate? Were some people convinced?\n\nPaul:\n\nI think Kuno was visiting IBM during period I started on the work and we discussed it and he was convinced if I recall and found something relevant in Japanese. No one much who accepted Chomsky style TG accepted it and Lightfoot wrote a negative review as I recall.\n\nBut as relational grammar developed everyone in that movement accepted it. It was obvious on passive grounds alone. That is, if passive is a relational thing based on same clause object becoming subject, then raising is a necessity, or so it seemed. Of course, then the HPSG and later GPSG types cooked up a way to analyze Frank believes Mary to be pregnant such that Mary was only in main clause (where Chomsky had claimed it was only in complement clause).\n\nThe worst thing about the debate about raising to object arose when Chomsky started talking in terms of ‘move alpha’. Because one of his arguments against raising to object is that it required a special ad hoc rule. But once it was permissible to talk about ‘move alpha’, that argument dissolved. But that was never observed.\n\nChris:\n\nSorry, I couldn't follow this last bit, about 'move alpha'. Could you elaborate?\n\nPaul:\n\nI don’t see the obscurity. Move alpha, not a rule although often called such, is a schema which permits any movement operation whatever. Bad stuff must be blocked by independent principles. So, raising to object is permitted at no cost, contrary to Chomsky’s argument that it was a costly ad-hoc addition to some otherwise excellent system. I will try to find tomorrow where Chomsky made the original argument which I claim move alpha dissolves.\n\nChris:\n\nOK, I see.\n\nAs you said, you started working on Relational Grammar during your time at IBM. What is the origin of RG? Are the original ideas yours, or Perlumtter's or somebody else's? Do you remember the period where you started thinking in those terms? And what were the initial ideas that got you going?\n\nPaul:\n\nI do not think it makes sense in general when two or more people work jointly, as Perlmutter and I certainly did, to ask whether the original ideas of the joint project were A’s or B’s, especially when memories are vague after 45 years or more. I do have a definite view about a couple, I mentioned, the unaccusative notion.\n\nThe period definitely began in 1972; I remember Perlmutter visiting for a couple of days and us writing up some ideas. The initial ideas were definitely heavy on passivization, moved on to double object relations (give the book to Chuck vs. give Chuck the book). Originally, we had a wrong view of this as involving the prepositional object being promoted to direct object status; this is entirely wrong as I showed in ‘Edge-Based’.\n\nThe early ideas are well documented if I recall in the volumes Studies in Relational Grammar I and II, and III.\n\nChris:\n\nI think that one thing RG did was to factor out passivization (and other grammatical relation changing operations) into different kinds of systems. There was the advancement rule of 2 --> 1, and that was invariant, but then other things like the presence of an auxiliary, or linear order, or a designated passive suffix, could vary. But these were independent of 2 -> 1. So, this is very different from the passive transformation in Chomsky 1957 that grouped all the effects into one transformational rule.\n\nAnother thing that I think RG did was to group all the relation changing operations together, as opposed to other kinds of operations. This seems to be a kind of precursor to the A/A' distinction in Principles and Parameters syntax.\n\nYet a third thing that RG did was to make available formal descriptions of a wide variety of languages, which are constantly being cited in later literature.\n\nAccording to you, what are the interesting scientific accomplishments of RG (we are still talking pre-APG here)?\n\nPaul:\n\nI think your characterizations of RG ideas here are in general justified.\n\nOf course, the unaccusative idea received its popular first formulation in RG terms, but as I told you, I had it in my thesis a decade earlier. At that time, it was no big deal since work had not congealed on the idea of a uniform initial rule S —> NP VP, so my rule S —> VP didn’t trample on any received wisdom. It didn’t require any invisible underlying expletive subjects, etc.\n\nI think the major contribution [C.C., of Relational Grammar] was documenting a very large number of relational facts in a lot of languages of different types, and showing how insightful relational descriptions could be given of them, which was not clearly possible in nonrelational terms.\n\nThere were also claimed relational laws, probably none of which were really right and some of which were clearly wrong. Like originally it was claimed passive always operates on direct objects, which is just wrong even for English, as I argued in ‘Edge-Based’. Some generalizations may be true, although facts are complicated, like the claim that in clause union cases a transitive subject is mapped to indirect object, a transitive object to direct object, etc. I have not thought about these matters in a long time but they are well represented in the ‘Studies in Relational Grammar’ volumes and also, I think in my ‘Studies of Passive Clauses’.\n\nI will mention one detail. The participial passive in French is like that in English in many respects, but in generally totally restricted to direct objects. But then there are the verbs (des)obeir. These do not take direct objects. And yet participial passives based on them are fine. In ‘Studies of Passive Clauses’, I show how to describe these facts without any complication of the conditions on passivization. Basically, with some simplification, one says that with these verbs and, I think them only, 3s/5s can advance to 2 but only if the resulting 2 is passivized. Problem solved. There are other cases like this; I showed something similar about the se faire type passive in French, which is strictly restricted to working on direct and indirect objects, except that with a few verbs which only take de objects like (se) moquer one can form se faire passives. I show in a paper that this is analogous, that is, the de phrases, taken to be 6s can advance to 3, but only if then submitted to the se faire passive construction. But I gave this analysis in APG terms.\n\nChris:\n\nCan you summarize briefly what separates RG, which you developed with Perlmutter and others from APG (Arc Pair Grammar), which you developed with David Johnson.\n\nI was at Cornell starting in 1993, and I would sometimes talk to Carol Rosen about RG. She even gave me a small tutorial one day, which I appreciated. But I don't think she adopted APG. I don't think Perlmutter took up APG either. Do you have any insight into that?\n\nIncidentally, I would say that other than Principles and Parameters and Minimalist Syntax, the framework that I know best is APG, since we drew so many trees in that framework over the years, especially in work on ‘Imposters’. I think APG is a wonderfully rich framework that has lots of important ideas to investigate.\n\nPaul:\n\nWell RG developed out of an amalgam of TG ideas with some crude ideas about primitive grammatical relations. It came to have a crude idea of clausal structures as non-tree graphs with arcs. But it did not have a good clear way of talking generally about relations between arcs. For internal relations it appealed to the bad idea of coordinates on arcs defining levels. But for trans-clausal relations, it could say that the object of one clause was also the subject of a lower one, by drawing upstairs and downstairs arcs with the same head phrase, but it did not have a way to represent the priority of the lower relation.\n\nAPG with its notion of the sponsor and erase relations between arcs, provided that as well as the formal basis to talk about deletions, to guarantee that when something advanced, demoted, or raised it in some sense ceased to involve (for surface purposes) the previous relation.\n\nNo, Perlmutter never really got into APG or really understood it. And as he developed a relatively large body of quite devoted students, this was problematical from my point of view because they also did not get into it and thus I often felt that the analyses they were trying to develop could be significantly better done if they utilized its tools. But as they had contact with Perlmutter on an intensive level and rarely with me, there was no way to influence the situation. Ditto for David Johnson, who also was of course not at a university and had no students.\n\nThere was one exception. Judith Aissen wrote an APG book on Tzotzil and we talked a lot about things on the phone. But I would say too the early version of APG in the book was itself very primitive; the version in ‘Edge-Based’ is far superior but that only appeared long after RG had essentially died as a movement.\n\nChris:\n\nThere are lots of things about APG that I like a lot.\n\nFor example, I like the way that movement is represented in terms of multidominance. This is an idea that is now coming into vogue in minimalist circles as well. But less intuitively, I like the way that anaphora is also represented in terms of multidominance. I think that is a very powerful syntactic idea that people (outside of APG) have not really tried to investigate. I also like the conception of passive by-phrases as arguments (initial 1s), which corresponds loosely to how I think about them. Lastly, you mentioned to me that its conception is model theoretic vs. proof theoretic, and in fact it is one of the original model-theoretic frameworks. I am not sure how important that distinction is, but it is intriguing that grammar can be looked at from such different perspectives.\n\nSo, my question to you is: What do you think the intellectual achievements of APG (the book not the framework) are? Why would you recommend that people look at it? What are the take-away important ideas? Just discuss a couple of the main ideas in lay terms accessible to a wider audience.\n\nPaul:\n\nI wouldn’t recommend that anyone read it. I would recommend that they not. Rather they should look at ‘Edge-Based’, which incorporates all of the important ideas in a more elegant form, leaves out lots of complex and pointless stuff and applies the ideas to lots of data in English.\n\nThe fundamentals contributions are to show how to construct a flexible and precise version of RG ideas, defining unclear notions like ‘advance’, ‘demote’, ‘raise’ in precise terms via the notion of successor/predecessor, in turn made possible by introducing two relations between arcs, SPONSOR and ERASE. The latter also permits a precise notion of deletion. SPONSOR and ERASE also permitted introduction of the REPLACE relation which, inter alia, permitted a rudimentary approach to some anaphora in terms of overlapping arcs.\n\nI suppose the idea of stating principles precisely enough to permit some proofs is of some interest, but the principles mostly weren’t serious enough to justify the space. Too much of the book depended on the notion of coordinates of arcs, which proved, I think, to be both quite complicated and ultimately unnecessary. There are none in ‘Edge-Based’. I suppose one could say too that the APG framework shows that talk of the necessity of movement in a grammatical theory is quite wrong. APG has no movement, despite your tendency to talk in such terms. The necessity stuff was also undermined radically by the GPSG introduction of slash categories. Anyway, no one has ever shown how movement ideas actually apply to natural language constructions, e.g. to passives, considering such sentences as:\n\n(1) The two gorillas were respectively taught French by Mike and taught German by Lucille.\n\n60 plus years of TG and not a clue how to describe (1) consistently with talk of movement. What is supposed to have moved in (1) and to where? Of course, there is no APG treatment either, but the latter does not come accompanied by grand claims about revolutionary insights into the human mind.\n\nChris:\n\nYou have mentioned such sentences to me on several occasions in the last ten years. I think one can show the same thing using coordination too. Could you briefly explain what problem this sentence raises?\n\nPaul:\n\nThe problem is palpable in any view of syntax which recognizes in passives generally a one to one relation between object (positions) and the subject positions of passives. There is such a relation in simple cases like:\n\n(2) The gorilla was taught by Mike.\n\nBut in (1) there are two object positions, one for the leftmost ’taught’, the other for the rightmost.\n\nBut only one subject. Moreover, in some sense, the semantic parts of that subject are understood\n\nas distributed to the two object positions. TG analyses just grind to a halt in the face of such sentences.\n\nChris:\n\nHas anybody ever worked on this problem? Have you written about it?\n\nPaul:\n\nYes, there is a bit of discussion in my ‘Three Investigations of Extraction’, 4.2.2.14 Interwoven Dependencies. I believe that those working in variants of categorial and logic grammars have worked on such cases. See for instance Bob Levine’s paper ‘Biolinguistics: Some foundational problems’ and references therein found in Christina Behme and Martin Neef, ‘Essays on Linguistic Realism’, Benjamins, 2018.\n\nChris:\n\nCould you describe for your readers what “model theoretic syntax” is and what the difference is between that and “proof theoretic syntax”?\n\n[C.C., See also David Johnson and Geoffrey Pullum’s mini-interviews for comments on this distinction.]\n\nPaul:\n\nAny grammar is going to be a set of formal objects, probably strings, defined by some syntax. A generative/proof theoretic grammar will interpret these formal objects as the equivalent of some Turing machine; they will be a set of instructions to form in a mechanical way a collection of other formal objects. The interpretation of the output is that all of the objects which the instructions yield are grammatical; the system is supposed to be such that each grammatical sentence is formed by the system after a finite number of applications. While Chomsky early in his career spoke of grammars as analogous to scientific theories, that was never true since his notion of grammar was always of the proof-theoretic kind. It was probably true that a grammar together with a claim that it determined all and only the objects of study was a theory. Such grammars are defined precisely in any book on computer science or formal language theory.\n\nA model-theoretic grammar interprets its contained formal objects as statements, formulas to which truth values can be assigned. The formulas will no doubt be equivalent to quantified statements in some second order logic. They will define the language at issue via satisfaction. That is, X will be a sentence of the language L defined by model-theoretic G(L) if and only if X satisfies every statement in G(L). In other words, such a grammar will be analogous to an axiom system in logic or mathematics, not analogous to a computer program.\n\nAs argued in my ‘Skeptical Linguistic Essays’, one of the virtues of a model theoretic approach is that it is not bound to a fixed lexicon, permitting it to characterize direct discourse, foreign metalinguistic statements, etc., which a generative grammar cannot. I terminologically characterized this by saying natural languages were open, whereas generative grammars can only characterize closed systems.\n\nGenerative grammars offer no way to even specify that sentences of the form (1) are fine in English:\n\n(1) The word W is a verb in Y\n\nwhere W is a variable over words from the languages over whose names Y is a variable.\n\nDitto for sentences like:\n\n(2) Marlyne screamed ftobskriflup three times.\n\nChris:\n\nAs I noted earlier, one of the innovations of APG was to used multi-dominance to describe various syntactic phenomena. Multi-dominance is also being used more and more in minimalist literature. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nPaul:\n\nSometimes an encounter with a particular piece of grammatical research raises questions both small and large about the way linguistic research deals with past work and thus how the history of the development of the field is taught. Such questions arose in my mind when I encountered the Doctoral Thesis About Sharing, a 2007 work by Martina Gracanin-Yuksek accepted at MIT, often rated as the number one linguistics department in the United States. This work was directed by four well-known scholars, David Pesetsky, Danny Fox, Norvin Richards and Sabine Iatridou.\n\nGracanin-Yuksek’s dissertation seeks inter alia to exploit a notion of multidomination in linguistic structures. That references situations where a single node has more than one distinct mother node. Such structures are expressly barred by the single mother condition part of standard definitions of phrase structure tree. Thus multidomination played no role in the first forty years or so of transformational grammar, which depended entirely on that notion of tree.\n\nIn reading the beginning of Gracanin-Yuksek’s dissertation, one is inevitably led to believe that the author assumes that the idea of multidomination is relatively new...she cites four works from the 1980s, none of which is at all typical of the exploitation of this idea at an earlier period and all of which invoke it only in very limited and construction specific ways. She also cites works from the 1990s and later. Apparently then, this author was entirely unaware of whole traditions of work which systematically exploited the idea starting in the 1970s. Such a notion was central to the relational grammar work of the 1970s and 1980s, which she nowhere mentions; see e.g. the three volumes of Studies in Relational Grammar published by the University of Chicago Press in 1983, 1984 and 1990. These contained inter alia work dating from the 1970s. The idea of structures not observing the single mother condition was embedded in an explicit formal framework in Johnson and Postal ‘s (1980) Arc Pair Grammar (Princeton University Press) and exploited in numerous papers and several books by me thereafter, specifically Edge-Based Clausal Syntax, MIT Press, 2010. Moreover, the latter work cited predecessors going back to the 1960s including Hockett’s (1966) article ‘Language, Mathematics, Linguistics’ in Thomas Sebeok (ed.) Current Trends in Linguistics, Mouton. and Morin and O’Malley’s (1969) article ‘Multi-Rooted Vines in Semantic Representation’, in Papers from the Fifth Regional Meeting, Chicago Linguistic Society. I quote from the latter (page 182), but provide only one of the diagrams from the original article:\n\n“Deleting axioms A2 and A3 generalizes the definition of a tree so as to permit more than one node to dominate a single node. Such a structure is a type of directed graph without cycles and will be called a vine. A vine is a set of nodes N with relations H and L such that L is a total order and H is a partial order.”\n\nJohnson and Postal (1980) also cited Geoffrey Sampson’s (1975) paper ‘The Single Mother Condition’, Journal of Linguistics 11, 1-11. This paper argued for rejection of the single mother condition on the basis of various facts of anaphora. The proposal was criticized and rejected in Robert D. Borsley, ‘In defense of single mothers’, Journal of Linguistics 6, 1980. Johnson and Postal (1980): also cited S. Saito’s 1976 article ‘On Dropping the Single Mother Condition: Notes on Split Controllers and Antecedent-Contained Pro-Forms’, Journal of Linguistics, 12, 1976 and George Lakoff’s 1977 article ‘On Linguistic Gestalts’ in Papers from the Thirteenth Regional Meeting, Chicago Linguistic Society.\n\nVariants of the idea of elements with multiple mothers were adopted in Lexical Functional grammar, see Joan Bresnan’s 2001 Lexical-Functional Grammar, Blackwell, Oxford, England also unmentioned, and in the HPSG framework, see Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag’s (1994) Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, University of Chicago Press, and its later developments; see the explicit acknowledgement in note 2, page 2 of that work.\n\nIn short, there was extensive discussion of, and proposals about, the posit of linguistic structures in which elements had multiple mothers decades before Gracanin-Yuksek’s thesis was accepted.\n\nGiven all this, it is rather remarkable, for example, to see on page 7 of that thesis a diagram of, and discussion of, an extraction construction in which the author speaks of such as involving a node which has a low mother and a higher one representing the position to which it is extracted as well. Reading this passage clearly gives the impression that the author believes she is stating some novel idea here. But e.g. Johnson and Postal (1980), probably written before the author was born, contains various examples of exactly that sort, e.g. (130) on page 263, (134) on page 267, (81a, b) on pa 325, (96a, b) on pages 332, 333. I could go on, but it is evidently tedious.\n\nThat the author was apparently ignorant of all this work is perhaps surprising perhaps not. But as a student, she depended on departmental people of authority, specifically her thesis directors. It was their job to dissolve this kind of ignorance, and to provide her with a reasonable breadth of knowledge of the hardly secret undeniable antecedents of intellectual ideas she was involved with. This is especially true since the relevant concepts seemingly ended up providing the core of her thesis. Instead, the instruction in her department seems to have left her completely in the dark.\n\nI can’t specify the reason. Could all of the thesis directors really have been so insulated from ideas outside of the mainstream MIT tradition as to be ignorant of these matters? Had they not heard of the works I cited? Or, worse, knowing of this work, did they decide for some reasons difficult to imagine that it was not their duty to make her aware of it?\n\nThe implications of the facts documented above are varied. Of lesser importance, at the time About Sharing was written at MIT, it was possible to successfully submit there a Ph. D. thesis which gave a radically distorted vision of the history of the ideas which it dealt with. This would be of limited importance if the MIT linguistics department was a minor influence in the field. But obviously this is not the case. Raised is the question of to what extent similarly flawed linguistic instruction was characteristic of other departments.\n\nStill more important is the question of whether and to what degree the type of lacuna revealed above has been characteristic of syntactic instruction in linguistic departments for decades. While I have documented only one particular case, I suggest more generally that for a very long time in very many places, and not only in the United States, the history of syntactic ideas has been badly represented in ways which favor one tradition and disfavor others, with such bias not grounded in argument or evidence.\n\nChris:\n\nThe word multidominance appears six times in Collins and Stabler 2016 (including in the abstract). In effect, the concept of multidominance was a central topic of discussion in the paper. But we did not mention Relational Grammar or Johnson and Postal or the other sources you cited. I attach the paper. So we are guilty of the same mistake that Grancanin-Yuksek was. But for us, the mistake is even worse, since I of course knew about Johnson and Postal, and had read large parts of it before Collins and Stabler appeared. In fact, I have always thought that the use of multidominance in Johnson and Postal was innovative and interesting. I am not sure why we did not include the relevant references. I am not even sure that the possibility occurred to me. I am guessing that we were trying to cite relevant literature from minimalist s"
