Some are false signs: things mistaken for some meaning. Being born when Jupiter aligns with Mars is taken as a good sign by some. Good and bad signs are ingrained in our experience!\n\nToday we are going to look at the signs that underpin a working Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system. It’s the old concept of semiotics, the study of signs. While stop signs and smoke signals can be signs, we will probe words and phrases of language for their use in NLU.\n\nSigns are vitally important because semiotics underpins understanding. Many modern models used to emulate human language focus only on signs — at their peril. So, let’s dive down deep into signs to see where the challenges are to understand language within conversation.\n\nI will illustrate this with examples from the system we have been developing at Pat Inc. for some time now based on my brain model, Patom Theory, and the linguistic framework, Role and Reference Grammar (RRG).\n\nWhat’s a sign?\n\nSigns are things that our brain takes to be a reference to something else. An American stop sign can mean ‘stop’, but some people will only see it as an octagonal red board…"
