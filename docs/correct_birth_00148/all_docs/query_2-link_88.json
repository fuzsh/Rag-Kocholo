        "text": "What is Chomsky's theory of language acquisition?\n\nHow do children learn their first language? Behaviourists believe that we learn it by copying our parents or caregivers. This was a popular view until the 1950s, advocated by linguists like BF Skinner (he set out his theory in the book Verbal Behavior). In response to this view, Chomsky proposed an alternative. Language learning is innate. Chomsky rejected Skinner's behaviorial theory because, he argued, children receive too little language stimulus to fully learn a language in such a short period of time, something he called 'impoverished language input' (baby talk). He set out his ideas in a review of Skinner's book (A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior) in 1967. Chomsky questioned how children could demonstrate signs of learning grammar before being taught it, and suggested that the human brain must have evolved to contain certain linguistic information from birth. Chomsky's theory of language acquisition is referred to as the Nativist theory or Innateness theory.\n\nInnate (adjective): Existing from the time a person or animal is born.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Chomsky questioned the idea that the human mind begins as a 'blank slate'. Instead, he suggested that the basic concepts of language are innate in every human's mind and are influenced by our linguistic environment. Chomsky suggests that a child's predisposition to learn a language is triggered when they hear speech, and that their brain will begin to interpret what is heard based on underlying structures and principles it already knows. Chomsky referred to this area of the brain as the 'Language Acquisition Device', or LAD for short, and suggests that it is the reason why children can learn a language only a few years after birth.\n\nChomsky has since gone on to revise his own theory on the LAD. He used to believe the LAD contained specific knowledge about language, but he now believes that it works more like a mechanism for working out the rules of language.\n\nOf course, all languages are different, and humans assign different meanings to different sounds worldwide. Chomsky does not believe that a child born in England has an innate ability to speak English or that a child born in China can miraculously speak Chinese. Instead, he suggests that all human languages share many of the same grammar principles.\n\nFor example, most languages:\n\nDifferentiate between verbs and nouns\n\nHave a way of talking about the past and present tense\n\nHave a way of asking questions\n\nHave a counting system"
