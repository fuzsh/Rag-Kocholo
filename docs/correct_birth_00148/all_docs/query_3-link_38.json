        "text": "According to Chomsky’s report of the mid 1970s, he and Harris developed their theories in an essentially independent way; whereas according to some statements by Harris, some contact actually took place between them. To shed light on this issue, it may be useful to systematically compare their respective views of the notion ‘transformation’ as well as their analyses of certain syntactic phenomena. Among the topics dealt with in the present article are: the system of syntactic categories and their symbols; the notion of ‘zero elements’; the phenomenon of discontinuous constituents; the English auxiliary system;wh-constructions; the typology of transformations; the notions of ‘kernel’ and ‘kernel sentence’.Several of these analyses show many points of contact between the two scholars (e.g., the analysis ofwh-constructions or that of English auxiliaries), which allow us to maintain that they surely influenced each other. The overall differences between the two models are also clear: th...\n\nAs Harris (2003: 152-170) has illustrated -especially by his concentration on the notion of ‘creativity’- ‘Chomsky the Saussurean’ is nothing but “an academic fable”. This fable is a result of misreading –by Chomsky himself (1964) and also by others-, assimilating Saussure’s la langue (in the singular form) with the generativist concept of ‘competence’ and, therefore, its grammar with the Universal Grammar (UG). Chomsky’s approach to deviant utterances, from his standpoint of individual psychology, never brings him to a concept of ‘grammar’ which function would also be to explain poems, puns and any kind of wordplay. The contradiction here is that, on one hand, he claims just to speak about the ‘individual faculty of language’ (which can lead to an infinitive number of individual grammars), and on the other hand, his aim is to discover the UG which means “a framework of principles and elements common to attainable human languages” (Chomsky, 1986: 3) (which for him would be a concrete unique absolute one). This situation leads him to assume a completely transcendental postulate which claims that all human beings share an innate, genetically determined language faculty that contains/knows the rules of UG. As a result, Chomsky and others in the huge generativist camp concentrate their attempts on the search for a vouchsafed ‘universal rule-and-concept system’ which is a reproduction of an old traditional dream of a ‘universal language of thought’. In a Saussurean perspective, this assumption, aside from its failure to observe the diversity and specificity of languages, is a metaphysical and, therefore, an incoherent basis for linguistic theory. Basing linguistic theory on language acquisition or biological facts is not at all acceptable for Saussure because any understanding of the faits de parole and ‘substantive facts’ presupposes an understanding or an implicit definition of language which is, in Chomsky’s case, the common modular understanding of language. The generativist modular conception of language, therefore, turns a deaf ear to the fundamental problems propounded by Saussure concerning the very essence of language, especially the arbitrariness of linguistic sign. How does Saussurean linguistics define its own grammar as General Grammar, and how does it deal with the common or universal linguistic facts which are the main goals for the Chomskyans? In the present study, this is a main concern, which I intend to consider as a matter of ‘algebra of language’ and also as a question of typology by investigating the few indications by Saussure in the CLG and ELG and the explications given by Hjelmslev. From this perspective, we will find only the universal arbitrary structural rules in our search for a general framework/calculus susceptible to describe all possible languages and language types. Finally, in agreement with Harris and De Mauro, we will claim that the Chomskyians and the Saussureans are in two fundamentally different paths in dealing with grammar, where the latter –and notably Hjelmslev- provides a broader possibility for theorizing language.\n\nAvram Noam Chomsky (born in 1928) is an American professor and public intellectual known for his work in linguistics, political activism, and social criticism. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\"1, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. In 1959, Noam Chomsky published a scathing review of B. F. Skinner's book Verbal Behavior.[6] At the time, Skinner's behaviorist paradigm dominated the field of psychology within the United States. Most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response, without positing internal representations. Chomsky argued that in order to explain language, we needed a theory like generative grammar, which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order.2 Chomsky's special viewpoint was the sentence-section of the parser, which concentrates on the grammars. Another section is the word's section of the parser etymology, which describes the etymology of the words. Both sections of the parser seem to be developed as optimized architectures. The words' architecture is permanently being optimized by degeneration and renewing by metamorphoses of the metaphors. The first concepts of the fundamental words seems to be generated as references to the 5 independent phonetic sources of the human voice: the tongue, the lips, teeth, palatal, and the guttural with the vocal chords. These sources are defined as the Places of articulation. Generative grammar considers grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language. It is a system of explicit rules that may apply repeatedly to generate an indefinite number of sentences which can be as long as one wants them to be.3 This essay concentrates on the relations between the grammar and the etymology of the fundamental pentagrammatons (father, mother, the virtues and the sky-god), which had been composed from letters, which represent the 5 phonetic sources of the human voice. The Vocabulary of the 5-Letter Words contains ~424 pentagrammatons, from which a number of compositions may purposely represent the fundamental words. Other pentagrammatons may unintentionally represent the 5 phonetic sources of the human voice. The conclusions in this essay on etymology may represent a helpful tool to understand the evolution of our languages."
