        "text": "Samsara is a Buddhist term, meaning the conditioned state of mind. It is the cycle of ignorance, leading to disturbing emotions and clumsy actions. They cause suffering, new disturbing feelings, and so on. According to Buddha’s teachings, there are three main disturbing feelings: ignorance, anger, and desire. They are called three poisons of mind and are told to have 84,000 combinations. The only way to completely get rid of suffering is to reach nirvana or the perfect state of Buddha. Until we are awakened, we live in samsara. Habit keeps us trapped in this cyclic existence characterized by suffering. The cycle of samsara in Buddhism is broken when we choose to follow the noble eightfold path toward nirvana. A person who truly escapes samsara is not looking for another, more just, more pleasant world. Such a world does not exist. All that needs to be done to reach nirvana is to stop looking for such a world. It is the search for a more pleasant, more just world that is causing the suffering.\n\nSLAM (1998) Slam is an American independent drama film directed, co-written and co-produced by documentarian Marc Levin and starring and co-written by Saul Williams (co-director of Neptune Frost) and Sonja Sohn (from HBO's The Wire). It tells the story of a young African-American man whose talent for poetry is hampered by his social background. Filmed in “drama-vérité” style, the fictional story is fused with the real-world backdrop of the nation’s capital, including the Dodge City neighborhood as well as an actual D.C. prison. Levin developed the story in collaboration with journalist Richard Stratton and the leads Williams and Sohn. Dialogue was mostly improvised by the actors, and the poetry recited is their own. Slam won the Grand Jury Prize for a Dramatic Film at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival as well as the Caméra d'Or at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nABSALOM, ABSALOM! by William Faulkner Absalom, Absalom!, published in 1936, takes place before, during, and after the American Civil War. It is a story about three families of the American South, with a focus on the life of Thomas Sutpen, a white man born into poverty in western Virginia who moves to Mississippi with the dual aims of gaining wealth and becoming a powerful family patriarch. The history of Sutpen mirrors the rise and fall of Southern plantation culture. By using various narrators expressing their interpretations, the novel alludes to the historical-cultural zeitgeist of Faulkner's South, where the past is always present and constantly in states of revision by the people who tell and retell the story over time; it thus also explores the process of myth-making and the questioning of truth. The title refers to the Biblical story of Absalom, a wayward son of King David, who was killed while fighting the empire his father built, causing David grief. Along with The Sound and the Fury, Absalom, Absalom! helped Faulkner win the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. The 1983 Guinness Book of World Records stated that the novel, at the time, contained the \"Longest Sentence in Literature\": 1,288 words.\n\nDAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991) Julie Dash’s rapturous vision of black womanhood and vanishing ways of life in the turn-of-the-century South was the first film directed by an African American woman to receive a wide release. In 1902, a multigenerational family in the Gullah community on the Sea Islands off of South Carolina—former West African slaves who carried on many of their ancestors’ Yoruba traditions—struggle to maintain their cultural heritage and folklore while contemplating a migration to the mainland, even further from their roots. Awash in gorgeously poetic, sun-dappled images at once dreamlike and precise, DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST forges a radical new visual language rooted in black femininity and the rituals of Gullah culture. — The Criterion Collection\n\nTHE INNER REACHES OF OUTER SPACE by Joseph Campbell Developed from a memorable series of lectures delivered in San Francisco, which included a legendary symposium at the Palace of Fine Arts with astronaut Rusty Schweickart, beloved mythologist Joseph Campbell explores the space age in his last book. Campbell posits that the newly discovered laws of outer space are actually at work within human beings as well and that a new mythology is implicit in this realization. He examines the new mythology and other questions in these essays which he described as \"a broadly shared spiritual adventure.\" But what is this new mythology? How can we recognize it? Campbell explores these questions in the concluding essay, \"The Way of Art,\" in which he demonstrates that metaphor is the language of art and argues that within the psyches of today's artists are the seeds of tomorrow's mythologies.\n\nTHE POWER OF MYTH by Joseph Campbell (with by Bill Moyers) The Power of Myth is a book based on the 1988 PBS documentary. The documentary was originally broadcast as six one-hour conversations between mythologist Joseph Campbell (1904–1987) and journalist Bill Moyers. The Power of Myth launched an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Joseph Campbell and his work. A preeminent scholar, writer, and teacher, he has had a profound influence on millions of people—including Star Wars creator George Lucas. To Campbell, mythology was the “song of the universe, the music of the spheres.” From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture. An impeccable match of interviewer and subject, a timeless distillation of Campbell’s work, The Power of Myth continues to exert a profound influence on our culture, encouraging us to move beyond our symbols for their polysemous insights.\n\nCOME AND SEE (1985) This legendary film from Soviet director Elem Klimov is a senses-shattering plunge into the dehumanizing horrors of war. As Nazi forces encroach on his small village in what is now known as Belarus, teenage Flyora (Alexei Kravchenko, in a searing depiction of anguish) eagerly joins the Soviet resistance. Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov’s subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design. Nearly blocked from being made by Soviet censors, who took seven years to approve its script, Come and See is perhaps the most visceral, impossible-to-forget antiwar film ever made. — Criterion Collection\n\nTASTE OF CHERRY (1997) The first Iranian film to win the Palme d’Or, this austere, emotionally complex drama by the great Abbas Kiarostami follows the enigmatic Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) as he drives around the hilly outskirts of Tehran looking for someone who will agree to bury him after he commits suicide, a taboo under Islam. Extended conversations with three passengers (a soldier, a seminarian, and a taxidermist) elicit different views on mortality and individual choice. Operating at once as a closely observed, realistic story and a fable populated by archetypal figures, Taste of Cherry challenges the viewer to consider what often goes unexamined in everyday life. — Criterion Collection"
