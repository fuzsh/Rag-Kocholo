        "text": "There’s no doubt that we acquire our native languages, complete with their vocabularies and grammatical patterns.\n\nBut is there an inherited ability underlying our individual languages — a structural framework that enables us to grasp, retain, and develop language so easily?\n\nIn 1957, linguist Noam Chomsky published a groundbreaking book called “Syntactic Structures.” It proposed a novel idea: All human beings may be born with an innate understanding of how language works.\n\nWhether we learn Arabic, English, Chinese, or sign language is determined, of course, by the circumstances of our lives.\n\nBut according to Chomsky, we can acquire language because we’re genetically encoded with a universal grammar — a basic understanding of how communication is structured.\n\nChomsky’s idea has since become widely accepted.\n\nLanguages share certain basic traits\n\nChomsky and other linguists have said that all languages contain similar elements. For example, globally speaking, language breaks down into similar categories of words: nouns, verbs, and adjectives, to name three.\n\nAnother shared characteristic of language is recursion. With rare exceptions, all languages use structures that repeat themselves, allowing us to expand those structures almost infinitely.\n\nFor example, take the structure of a descriptor. In almost every known language, it’s possible to repeat descriptors over and over again: “She wore an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka dot bikini.”\n\nStrictly speaking, more adjectives could be added to further describe that bikini, each embedded within the existing structure.\n\nThe recursive property of language allows us to expand the sentence “She believed Ricky was innocent” almost endlessly: “Lucy believed that Fred and Ethel knew Ricky had insisted he was innocent.”\n\nThe recursive property of language is sometimes called “nesting,” because in almost all languages, sentences can be expanded by placing repeating structures inside each other.\n\nChomsky and others have argued that because almost all languages share these characteristics despite their other variations, we may be born preprogrammed with a universal grammar.\n\nWe learn language almost effortlessly\n\nLinguists like Chomsky have argued for a universal grammar in part because children everywhere develop language in very similar ways in short periods of time with little assistance.\n\nChildren show awareness of language categories at extremely early ages, long before any overt instruction occurs.\n\nFor example, one study showed that 18-month-old children recognized “a doke” referred to a thing and “praching” referred to an action, showing they understood the form of the word.\n\nHaving the article “a” before it or ending with “-ing” determined whether the word was an object or an event.\n\nIt’s possible they had learned these ideas from listening to people talk, but those who espouse the idea of a universal grammar say it’s more likely that they have an innate understanding of how words function, even if they don’t know the words themselves.\n\nAnd we learn in the same sequence\n\nProponents of universal grammar say children the world over naturally develop language in the same sequence of steps.\n\nSo, what does that shared developmental pattern look like? Many linguists agree that there are three basic stages:\n\nlearning sounds\n\nlearning words\n\nlearning sentences\n\nMore specifically:\n\nWe perceive and produce speech sounds.\n\nWe babble, usually with a consonant-then-vowel pattern.\n\nWe speak our first rudimentary words.\n\nWe grow our vocabularies, learning to classify things.\n\nWe build two-word sentences, and then increase the complexity of our sentences.\n\nDifferent children proceed through these stages at different rates. But the fact that we all share the same developmental sequence may show we’re hardwired for language.\n\nWe learn despite a ‘poverty of stimulus’\n\nChomsky and others have also argued that we learn complex languages, with their intricate grammatical rules and limitations, without receiving explicit instruction.\n\nFor example, children automatically grasp the correct way to arrange dependent sentence structures without being taught.\n\nWe know to say “The boy who is swimming wants to eat lunch” instead of “The boy wants to eat lunch who is swimming.”\n\nDespite this lack of instructional stimulus, we still learn and use our native languages, understanding the rules that govern them. We wind up knowing a lot more about how our languages work than we’re ever overtly taught.\n\nNoam Chomsky is among the most oft-quoted linguists in history. Nevertheless, there’s been lots of debate around his universal grammar theory for over half a century now.\n\nOne fundamental argument is that he’s got it wrong about a biological framework for language acquisition. Linguists and educators who differ with him say we acquire language the same way we learn everything else: through our exposure to stimuli in our environment.\n\nOur parents speak to us, whether verbally or using signs. We “absorb” language by listening to conversations taking place all around us, from the subtle corrections we receive for our linguistic errors.\n\nFor instance, a child says, “I no want that.”\n\nTheir caregiver responds, “You mean, ‘I don’t want that.’”\n\nBut Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar doesn’t deal with how we learn our native languages. It’s focused on the innate capacity that makes all our language learning possible.\n\nA more fundamental criticism is that there are hardly any properties shared by all languages.\n\nTake recursion, for example. There are languages that simply aren’t recursive.\n\nAnd if the principles and parameters of language aren’t really universal, how could there be an underlying “grammar” programmed into our brains?"
