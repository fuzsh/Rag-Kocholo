        "text": "Avram Noam Chomsky (born in 1928) is an American professor and public intellectual known for his work in linguistics, political activism, and social criticism. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\"1, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. In 1959, Noam Chomsky published a scathing review of B. F. Skinner's book Verbal Behavior.[6] At the time, Skinner's behaviorist paradigm dominated the field of psychology within the United States. Most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response, without positing internal representations. Chomsky argued that in order to explain language, we needed a theory like generative grammar, which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order.2 Chomsky's special viewpoint was the sentence-section of the parser, which concentrates on the grammars. Another section is the word's section of the parser etymology, which describes the etymology of the words. Both sections of the parser seem to be developed as optimized architectures. The words' architecture is permanently being optimized by degeneration and renewing by metamorphoses of the metaphors. The first concepts of the fundamental words seems to be generated as references to the 5 independent phonetic sources of the human voice: the tongue, the lips, teeth, palatal, and the guttural with the vocal chords. These sources are defined as the Places of articulation. Generative grammar considers grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language. It is a system of explicit rules that may apply repeatedly to generate an indefinite number of sentences which can be as long as one wants them to be.3 This essay concentrates on the relations between the grammar and the etymology of the fundamental pentagrammatons (father, mother, the virtues and the sky-god), which had been composed from letters, which represent the 5 phonetic sources of the human voice. The Vocabulary of the 5-Letter Words contains ~424 pentagrammatons, from which a number of compositions may purposely represent the fundamental words. Other pentagrammatons may unintentionally represent the 5 phonetic sources of the human voice. The conclusions in this essay on etymology may represent a helpful tool to understand the evolution of our languages."
