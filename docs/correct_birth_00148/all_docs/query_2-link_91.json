During the years 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard University Society of Fellows.

He has written and lectured widely on linguistics, philosophy, intellectual history, contemporary issues, international affairs and U.S. foreign policy. His most recent books are A New Generation Draws the Line; New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind; Rogue States; 9-11; Understanding Power; On Nature and Language; Pirates and Emperors, Old and New; Chomsky on Democracy and Education; Middle East Illusions; Hegemony or Survival; Imperial Ambitions; Failed States; Perilous Power; Interventions; Inside Lebanon; and What we Say Goes: Conversations on U.S. Power in a Changing World."
