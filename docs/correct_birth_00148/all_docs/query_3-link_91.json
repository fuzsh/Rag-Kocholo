        "text": "Steven Pinker (born September 18, 1954, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) is a Canadian-born American psychologist who advocates evolutionary explanations for the functions of the brain and thus for language and behaviour.\n\nPinker was raised in a largely Jewish neighbourhood of Montreal. He studied cognitive science at McGill University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in psychology in 1976. He earned a doctorate in experimental psychology at Harvard University in 1979. After stints as an assistant professor at Harvard (1980–81) and at Stanford University (1981–82), he joined the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). There he served as codirector of the Center of Cognitive Science (1985–94) and, having been made full professor in 1989, as director of the McDonnell-Pew Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (1994–99). Pinker returned to Harvard in 2003 as a full professor.\n\n(Read Steven Pinker’s Britannica entry on rationality.)\n\nHis early studies on the linguistic behaviour of children led him to endorse noted linguist Noam Chomsky’s assertion that humans possess an innate facility for understanding language. Eventually Pinker concluded that this facility arose as an evolutionary adaptation. He expressed this conclusion in his first popular book, The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (1994). The sequel, How the Mind Works (1997), earned a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. In that book, Pinker expounded a scientific method that he termed “reverse engineering.” The method, which involved analyzing human behaviour in an effort to understand how the brain developed through the process of evolution, gave him a way to explain various cognitive phenomena, such as logical thought and three-dimensional vision.\n\nIn Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language (1999) Pinker offered an analysis of the cognitive mechanisms that make language possible. Exhibiting a lively sense of humour and a talent for explaining difficult scientific concepts clearly, he argued that the phenomenon of language depended essentially on two distinct mental processes—the memorization of words and the manipulation of them with grammatical rules.\n\nPinker’s work was received enthusiastically in some circles but stirred controversy in others. His strictly biological approach to the mind was seen as dehumanizing from some religious and philosophical perspectives; scientific objections were raised as well. Many of his colleagues, including paleobiologist Stephen Jay Gould, felt that the data on natural selection were as yet insufficient to support all of his claims and that other possible influences on the brain’s development existed.\n\nPinker at times directly replied to critics of his evolutionary approach to cognition in The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature (2002), also a Pulitzer Prize finalist. The book dismisses tabula rasa notions of human mental development, citing a large body of research indicative of the determinist role played by genes. While acknowledging the ethical quandaries raised by his corollary assertions that people of different genders and ethnicities might have different cognitive abilities due to the disparate evolutionary forces at work upon them, Pinker argued that such revelations need not impede equal treatment. His protestations did little to assuage the concerns of detractors who felt that the claims espoused in the book inevitably created hierarchical relationships between individuals of different backgrounds."
