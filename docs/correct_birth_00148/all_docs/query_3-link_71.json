This means that the demand for the original product becomes more elastic, or responsive to changes in price, as consumers have more options to choose from. In contrast, when a product has few substitutes, consumers have limited options and are more likely to continue purchasing the product even if the price increases, making the demand less elastic. Therefore, as the number of substitutes for a good increases, the price elasticity of demand should become larger. This indicates that changes in price will have a greater effect on the quantity demanded.\n\nLearn more about elasticity of demand here:\n\nhttps://brainly.com/question/30704413\n\n#SPJ11\n\nIn the given scenario, ceteris paribus (all other factors remaining constant), as the number of substitutes for a good increase, the correct statement is option c. price elasticity of demand should become larger.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in its price. When there are more substitutes available for a particular good, consumers have more options to switch to if the price of the good increases. This means that the quantity demanded will be more sensitive to price changes, and hence, the price elasticity of demand will become larger.\n\nA larger price elasticity of demand indicates that consumers are more likely to switch to alternative goods if the price of the original good increases, making the demand for the original good more elastic. This is a crucial factor for firms when determining their pricing strategies, as they need to consider the presence of substitutes and the potential impact on their sales volume.\n\nIn summary, as the number of substitutes for a good increases, the price elasticity of demand becomes larger, reflecting a higher sensitivity of quantity demanded to changes in price due to the availability of alternative options for consumers.
