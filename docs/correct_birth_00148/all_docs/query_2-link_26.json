        "text": "Noam Chomsky (full name Avram Noam Chomsky) was born on December 7, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to William and Elsie Chomsky. His father, aprofessor of Hebrew, spoke Yiddish as his primary language. However, Chomsky was discouraged from speaking Yiddish in his house during childhood. Though the community he grew up in was described as being a“Jewish Ghetto” composed of mainly Hebrew speakers, Chomsky was surrounded by anti-Semitism both in the surrounding communities and in school.\n\nChomsky was highly influenced by his uncle. His uncle owned anewsstand, where professors and other intellectuals would gather and debate various topics which were great sources of stimulation for Chomsky. Chomsky also involved himself in avariety of Zionist organizations early on, though his later perspectives on Zionism would become controversial."
