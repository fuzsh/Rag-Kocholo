        "text": "Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author, just turned 93 years old. In this interview with Kurdish journalist Nejla Ari, he spoke about the Kurdish Question today.\n\nConsidered the founder of modern linguistics, Noam Chomsky is one of the most cited scholars in modern history.\n\nThe interview was prepared with the support of the Campaign Against Criminalising Communities CAMPACC and the Peace in Kurdistan campaign in collaboration with Free Journo. He is a founding member and patron of Peace in Kurdistan Campaign.\n\nPeace in Kurdistan - https://www.peaceinkurdistancampaign.com\n\nCampaign Against Criminalising Communities (CAMPACC} - http://www.campacc.org.uk\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY\n\nhttps://chomsky.info/\n\nNoam Chomsky, (born December 7, 1928, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American theoretical linguist whose work from the 1950s revolutionized the field of linguistics by treating language as a uniquely human, biologically based cognitive capacity. Through his contributions to linguistics and related fields, including cognitive psychology and the philosophies of mind and language, Chomsky helped to initiate and sustain what came to be known as the “cognitive revolution.” Chomsky also gained a worldwide following as a political dissident for his analyses of the pernicious influence of economic elites on U.S. domestic politics, foreign policy, and intellectual culture."
