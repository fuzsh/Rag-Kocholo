        "text": "The aim of this article is to elucidate the anthropological conditions of possibility for computing. I will first show how symbolic manipulation is constitutive of hominization. Secondly, I will examine the gradual widening of the gearing between the sensorial world (signifiers) and the intelligible world (concepts) during cultural evolution. Following on from these analyses, I’ll comment some of the main features of contemporary digital civilization, including the development of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nPhenomenal experience\n\nIn the animal kingdom, the development of the nervous system stems from the need for locomotion: the senses and motor skills are looped together to guide movement. Over the course of evolution, this reflex circuit becomes more complex, involving simulation of the environment, evaluation of the situation and decision-making calculations leading to action. An existential emergence accompanies cognitive necessity, as the nervous system generates a phenomenal experience populated by multimodal images (cenesthesia, touch, taste, smell, hearing, sight), including the sensation of one’s own movements. Animal consciousness relates to a world outside itself: it is intentional. Its objects are conserved beyond the variety of immediate perceptions. Pleasure and pain polarize the range of sensations, and emotions direct activity. Locomotion obliges the animal to localize its presence and inhabit a territory. Its consciousness is not only immersed in space and full of present sensations, but also virtualized by an imagination that reminds it of past events (the squirrel remembers the places where it hid its nuts), ensures the continuity of its movements and projects it into the immediate future. It discerns the situations in which it is thrown and categorizes the objects of its perception. It recognizes prey, predators or sexual partners and acts accordingly. This is only possible because neural circuits (innate or learned) encode interaction patterns – or concepts – that orient, coordinate and give meaning to its phenomenal experience, while supporting complex social communication with its fellow creatures. Animal communication signals – calls, postures, pheromones – carry concepts (« predator approaching », « food », « this is my territory », « submission », etc.) but they are biologically inherited, limited in number and complexity, and refer only to current situations.\n\nThe symbolic revolution\n\nUpright posture, the hand, toolmaking, and the mastery of fire set the Homo genus apart. Then Neanderthals, Denisovans and Sapiens start talking. Our brains have the same properties as those of higher vertebrates, with the cognitive and communicative capacities just mentioned, and the corresponding type of sensorial experience. But it also possesses a capacity for recognizing and producing symbols that takes us into a whole new world. The biological evolution that leads to the human being has transformed the brain of the initial primate, adjusting it to a symbolic specialization that is unique in the animal kingdom: hypertrophy of the prefrontal cortex, amplification of the cerebellum, appearance of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, greater division of labor between the hemispheres and general reorganization of neural circuits. As an ontological interface, the human brain drives the symbiosis and coevolution of symbolic ecosystems with populations of speaking primates immersed in the biosphere.\n\nWhat is a symbol? In a nutshell, it’s the conventional translation (which varies from society to society) of a concept – i.e. a scheme organizing the experience – into a sensory phenomenon. It should be added that – far from being independent of one another – symbols are organized into systems that regulate their compositions, substitutions and differences. By projecting themselves onto the sensorial images of symbolic systems, the concepts that organized the phenomenal world from the opaque interior of the vertebrate cranium become explicit, sharable and combinable at will. The symbolic revolution has repercussions for the lived world as a whole. Communication is cast in the mold of conventional languages and codes; complex rituals organize social relations and combinations of artifacts drive sensorimotor interactions.\n\nCommunication\n\nIn contrast to the indexical or iconic communication of other animals, we tell what happened yesterday, make appointments for next week and invent stories. The territories of our evolutionary ancestors were populated by actual objects and agents. The human world is also made up of places, beings and events that are invisible, or have long since disappeared, or will never happen. A language has thousands of elementary units of meaning, orders of magnitude more than the signal repertoire of animal species. Verbs and common nouns designate general categories, while proper nouns label singular beings and events. Language translates interaction patterns into sentences. The verb evokes the action, grammatical roles describe the actors and circumstances, and the whole models a complex scene. Each word in a sentence also evokes a pattern of interaction: « gift », « sacrifice », « birth », « hunt » and so on. Linguistic symbols are organized according to a recursive grammar: expressions are composed in sequences and fit together like Russian dolls, making it possible to construct and decipher an indefinite number of complex texts with distinct meanings. Talking primates elaborate the schemas that organize their experience with hyper-realistic detail. The immediate and massive concepts of other animals give way to genealogies, fine classifications, genera, species and their differences, webs of refined notions whose every node is in turn a network. Our narratives interweave and respond to each other. The range of mental representations expands indefinitely.\n\nThe linguistic symbol is split in two, since it has (a) an actual or signifying part: a sound, visual, tactile or other image, such as the sound « tree », and (b) a virtual or signified part: a general concept, such as « woody plant with roots, trunk and branches ». The signifier itself is split into an abstract form (phoneme, character, gesture) without address, timeless, and some concrete, situated, dated image: this timbre of voice, this letter, a waving hand. The signified, in turn, has both a virtual and an actual component. The dictionary and grammar of a language define the virtual, general, still-floating part of the meaning of a word. Our knowledge of language enables us to decode this sequence of phonemes and translate it into a network of concepts, a narrative that evokes images, emotions and memories. For a moment, a rhizome of meaning illuminates the silence of experience. A meaning is actualized in this way for us, but it would be actualized differently in other circumstances for someone else, endowed with a singular memory.\n\nAlthough the signifying parts of symbols – moving images – only appear to the senses in phenomenal space-time, for human intelligence they designate signified that populate an inexhaustible abstract universe, at the intersection of hierarchical structures of composition (syntagms) and symmetrical structures of opposition and substitution (paradigms). Such arrangements – both syntactic and semantic – are not limited to languages. They can be found to a greater or lesser extent in other sign systems. For example, like the paradigms of language, the harmonies of music organize an order of simultaneity and possible choices, while melody unfolds linearly in time, like the syntagm in linguistics. As for visual communication, palettes of shapes and colors form substitution groups that intersect the compositional plane of images.\n\nElementary emotions are diffracted into a myriad of mingled feelings, violent or delicate. Places are named, measured and mapped. The dense net of hours and calendars captures temporality. Language opens the space for questioning, dialogue, and narrative. It supports reasoning, demonstration and a concern for truth… not forgetting misleading concealment and disinformation. What’s more, it’s not only messages that are coded, but also systems of veridiction, i.e., depending on the occasion, ways of deciding what is true or beautiful.\n\nSociety\n\nThe person and its individual identity emerge through dialogue. The implicit self-reference in animal experience is redoubled in humans by an explicit first person (“I”), to which a second person – the other – inevitably faces and responds (“You”). Both navigate the shared reality perceived in the third person (“It, them”), a world assumed to be objective and common.\n\nSocieties of the same animal species resemble each other. In contrast, human groups know a great diversity of social roles and rules of interaction. Kinship, political organization, or commerce with the invisible (ancestors, spirits, gods, and values) fall under convention. Rituals codify, socialize, and reify a symbolic order that systems of justification – morals, laws, religions, traditions – explain and motivate.\n\nSocial roles have common traits with grammatical roles, not the least of which is recursive nesting. The syntactic trees of language correspond to the genealogical trees of families and the organizational charts of administrations. Oppositions of the type « brother and sister » in the role of full sibling or « police and army » in the role of security guarantor, or even the social partitions of the type « priests, warriors, and peasants » resemble the groups of difference and substitution of lexical paradigms.\n\nTechnique\n\nIf symbolization consists in projecting into the world of senses and systematizing behavior patterns, then it concerns not only communication codes and social relations but also interactions with the physical world. Artifacts and tools are produced by common methods, they exhibit « affordances » (possibilities of use) and dictate gestures. The most material techniques participate in the symbolic order through their externalization and socialization of bodily functions, through their reification of perceptions and movements. A fortiori, the virtual dimension of our relations to things composes an essential part of cultural systems: the rules that govern labor and property, the processes of exchange and accounting. While animal societies know neither currency nor economy, the most primitive tribes use shells for their bartering and keep memory of gifts and counter-gifts.\n\nSyntax finds its place in the battle order of armies and the arrangement of technical gestures. The arborescent structures of sentences and texts are found in the sequence of operations leading to the construction of buildings, the weaving of fabrics, or the cooking recipes. And in most cases, Homo Faber can replace one material with another, alter the thickness of threads, or substitute potato for rice while retaining the general action plan. The same wooden handle ends in the metal head of a shovel, a pickaxe, or a fork, just as the words of a paradigm may substitute for one another in the same narrative context.\n\nCultural symbiosis\n\nThe orders of signs, people and things are intertwined in the tight braid of hominization. We have only examined them in turn for the sake of exposition. Let’s define culture as the totality of symbolic systems (semiotic, social, technical), their products and their layers of sedimented inscriptions. From then on, the life of the mind – which transcends individual existences – results from a symbiosis between the speaking primates that make up a society and the culture they share.\n\nCultures codify, share and reify concepts (the patterns organizing experience), while individuals incorporate languages, rituals and technical practices. The conventions and tools transmitted by culture can only be implemented if living people internalize their uses, embody their handling and treat them as second nature. This is why, however diverse – or even heterogeneous – social constructions and cultural artifices may be in a particular time and place, the living bodies that integrate them make an organic unit out of them.\n\nIt can take many years to learn how to handle semiotic conventions, as in the case of writing. For interlocutors to reconstitute networks of concepts from a sequence of phonemes and translate ideas or instructions into sounds, all the following needs to be integrated into the reflexes and perceptive habits of the organism: the dictionary that establishes the correspondence between signifiers and elementary signified, the grammar that governs the composition of units of meaning, not forgetting the prosody, accents and music of the language. The same applies to social relations. We learn to discern the interpersonal relationships at play in our environment, to identify with roles, to embody them as best we can, and to play our part in conventional scenarios, aided by initiation journeys and the repetition of ritual enactments. The use of artefacts, the handling of tools, the driving of vehicles and the collective execution of complex tasks once again presuppose the physical and mental internalization of ambient techniques.\n\nIndividuals can only survive if they assimilate symbolic systems and appropriate their products. Symmetrically, to endure, a culture must be absorbed, implemented, and transmitted by individuals. In this relationship, where each participant feeds off the other, culture represents the virtual pole, neither dead nor alive, waiting to be actualized by a human population. As for individuals, they embody the subjective, present, sensitive, living and mortal pole of the symbolic dynamic. And each generation, whether oblivious or ardent, innovative or decadent, casts the dice again. Such is the motor of cultural evolution. The immemorial heritage of our ancestors sustains our living spirits, just as from the depths of tropical waters the coral piled up by centuries carries multicolored fish towards the sunlight.\n\nSymbolic stigmergy\n\nThe collective intelligence of animals is largely based on stigmergic communication: the traces they leave in a shared environment enable them to coordinate their actions. The scent of pheromones, the echo of cries and songs, the fleeting image of postures or footprints elicit immediate reactions. Like other eusocial species, we communicate stigmergically, but instead of marking a physical territory with pheromones or other types of visual, auditory or olfactory signals, we leave symbolic traces. The human kingdom amplifies stigmergic mechanisms. Elaborate symbolic texts accumulate, respond to each other, they are fed and reappropriated by groups and individuals. Not only does the shared memory become longer and more complex, but the synchronization of experiences and the propagation of affects intensifies. Now that symbolic systems have been incorporated by individuals, signifiers, ritual gestures and familiar artifacts automatically trigger neural circuits, along with the patterns of interaction, emotions, images, memories and motor impulses they evoke. Just as contact with a pheromone molecule triggers reflex behavior in an ant, we can’t help but understand speech that reaches our eardrums, and the slightest story irresistibly evokes mental representations and feelings. The audience at a show, the dancers at a rave, the demonstrators chanting a slogan all resonate. The members of a rowing or soccer team are perhaps more in tune than a herd of baboons or a clan of wolves will ever be.\n\nSymbolic manipulation\n\nLet it be clear that the human mind never leaves sensory experience. The most complex combinations of culture are rooted in a spatio-temporal universe, inhabited by tangible objects and agents, interwoven with imagined causal relations, animated from within by the tropisms of emotion, resonating with timbres and rhythms, alternating shadow and light, sweetness and violence. But this sensory experience, because it is significant for our symbolic species, points to an intelligible world whose relationships, successions and connections are quite different from those of space, time and material causality. The concepts that populate the intelligible world can be located at the intersection of three axes. A first axis – closely symbolic – organizes the correspondence between sensory images and their conceptual counterparts, whether linguistic signifiers, social relations or technical functions. A second axis structures concepts according to syntactic trees, each leaf of which can become – recursively – a root. In the order of signs, grammars compose linguistic or musical phrases, assemble texts and images, and arrange artworks according to skillful taxonomies of periods, genres, schools and subjects. Social syntaxes shape the structure of institutions, hierarchizing or symmetrizing ages, genders and classes; they regulate games, distribute roles, balance powers and divide labor. Technical syntaxes schematize operations in series or in parallel, lay out small workshops and vast factories, interweave machine parts and logistics chains. Finally, the third axis – paradigmatic – orders the systems of differences and substitutions whose rotating rings fill the nodes of syntactic trees. The intelligible world unfolds between these three axes, teeming, diverse, interdependent, mutating, hybridizing, swept along by an irreversible cultural evolution.\n\nIn short, symbolization places the human mind at the interface between two worlds: that of physical movement and sensory images, governed by a group of spatio-temporal transformations, and that of intelligible forms, governed by a group of conceptual transformations. This is why ideal operations are linked to physical operations and, symmetrically, tangible transformations lead to conceptual changes. The morphism that links the two universes opens a field of action inaccessible to pre-symbolic animality, since it becomes possible to command conceptual transformations from physical movements and to sequence material gestures according to conceptual operations. At the core of anthropogenesis, we discover symbolic manipulation. Calculation is original. From the folding of the conceptual onto the perceptual, and its condition of possibility in the human brain, the widening of the passage between the two orders of reality, and the growing efficiency of their reciprocal translation, set the pace for a cultural evolution that never ceases to take up and amplify the event of hominization.\n\nImplemented in a distributed manner in the brains of speaking primate populations, five symbolic operating systems have succeeded one another, each new version being fully compatible with the previous ones. Nomadism, tribal organization, hunting and gathering, knowledge transmitted through rituals and storytelling, and shamanism for relationships with the invisible correspond to primary orality. The first writings, or the self-preservation of symbols, accompany palace-temple civilizations, large-scale breeding and agriculture, the school of scribes and the systematization of knowledge. The zero, the alphabet and paper optimized the manipulation of signifiers in trading cities and empires, with their literate elites, universal religions, philosophies and currencies. From the 16th century onwards, the mechanization of writing and time measurement heralded modernity: the natural sciences became experimental and mathematical; engines revolutionized industry and transport; nation states, new secular perspectives on salvation (such as liberalism or socialism) and compulsory education transformed societies. Finally, the electrification, electronic media and computerization of the twentieth century pave the way for contemporary digital culture, based on techniques for controlling energy and matter on the scale of elementary particles, the automatic transformation of signs, instantaneous interactive global communication and the information economy. It is still difficult to specify the new political, epistemic and ideological forms that will prevail in the new culture. What is certain, however, is that the digital is our global symbolic operating system, not only – as is obvious – in terms of communication and technology, but also in terms of social relations.\n\nIs this a return to the fable of progress (« It just gets better and better »)? No, because an operating system can support a variety of applications, which can be judged as good or bad depending on one’s point of view. The same « nation-state » political form has a liberal and a totalitarian face, the same industrial structure manufactures cars and tanks, the same Internet serves information and disinformation. I would add that the general notion of progress assumes a constant evaluation criterion from the Paleolithic to the 21st century – this criterion generally being that of contemporaries – while each era, each culture reinvents its ultimate values.\n\nMy partition into five successive symbolic operating systems simplifies a continuous process, unevenly distributed in space, subject to multiple shifts, backtracking and leapfrogging. What’s more, the cultural forms that appear in each era do not disappear in subsequent eras but are taken up again and adapted to a new context. Despite the complexity of the process, the general evolution seems irreversible and firmly oriented towards an ever more efficient interplay between the world of senses and the intelligible.\n\nDigitizing communication\n\nIn the long run of accelerating evolution, symbols detach themselves from their places of origin, surviving better and better the moment of their birth. Here they are, becoming lighter, more numerous, more widespread, translated and transformed. But the « softer » the symbols become, the more they approach an omnipresent, malleable form that escapes the inertia of matter, the more their inscription requires « hard » supports, instruments and installations that are heavily material. The manipulation of signs has a long history, in which the virtualization of codes and the hardening of media are mutually supportive: clay tablets, papyrus or silk scrolls, the road and port networks of ancient empires, horse-drawn mail, paper manufacture, printing machines, school and library buildings, telegraph poles on railroad lines, antennas and satellites, right up to data centers that consume the electricity of a power plant and the magazines, radios, record players, televisions, computers and telephones spewed out by factories and eventually piled up jumbled in waste dumps.\n\nThe intelligible and the tangible alternate, intertwining and complicating each other. Each turn of their evolving spiral deposits a new layer of complexity, which leads to the next revolution. These two modes of being are like the relationship between Yin and Yang in traditional Chinese philosophy. One of the main Confucian classics, the Yi-King (or I-Ching) represents the dynamics of cosmic, political, and personal transformations by means of sixty-four hexagrams: six stacked lines, some of which are continuous (Yang), and others broken (Yin). This ancient oracular book presents one of the first alignments between the signifying structure and the signified situation: the two planes of the hexagrams (signifiers) and the practical configurations (signifieds) obey the same group of transformations. Should we trace back to this the binary coding and the regulated manipulation of signifieds by means of signifiers that characterizes computing? Or should we identify the beginnings of automatic calculation with Aristotle’s formalization of logical reasoning? What about the Indian mathematicians who invented positional numeration with nine digits and the zero, making arithmetic calculations simple and uniform? Or the development of algebra by Arabic-speaking, Andalusian or Persian mathematicians, such as Al Khawarizmi, who gave his name to the algorithm? In all these cases, the regulated, quasi-mechanical manipulation of visible, tangible elements leads to the movement of virtual objects: political tropes, logical propositions or insubstantial numbers.\n\nCalculation\n\nLet’s take a closer look at calculus, a textbook case of the clutch between the sensible and the intelligible. It can be defined as the art of mechanizing symbolic operations. Calculus presupposes the adoption of a coding system for variables and operations, as well as the definition of chains of operations: algorithms. The application of an algorithm to a set of input variables leads to the result variable as output. As symbols are made up of a signifier and a signified part, calculations are even more efficient as they are applied to signifiers in a mechanical way, i.e. without taking signifieds into account. Algorithms are blind to the semantic content of the symbols they manipulate. Even when we multiply by hand, we always follow the same routine, whatever the numbers being multiplied. The signifiers manipulated by operations can be likened to material pieces such as tokens, marbles or pebbles. The word calculus itself comes from the Latin calculus meaning pebble, because the ancient Romans used pebbles to perform arithmetic operations on abacuses.\n\nCalculus is an art insofar as the coding of the signified by a certain system of signifiers facilitates the regulated manipulation of symbols to a greater or lesser extent. For example, the number notation system of the ancient Egyptians and Romans does not lend itself to as efficient algorithmic manipulation of numbers as the zero-based positional notation of the Indo-Arabic numerals. Try multiplying large numbers using Roman numerals to see for yourself. The efficiency of symbolic manipulation involves a compromise between, on the one hand, the generality of algorithms (maximizing the cases to which they apply) and, on the other, minimizing the number of operations required to arrive at the result.

Advances in algebraic coding and the refinement of automatic calculation procedures generally mark a leap in consistency and rigor in the field to which they apply, as shown by the breakthroughs of modern experimental science, which have often unified disparate forms and methods by means of algebraic sweeps.\n\nCalculating machines\n\nMechanical calculating machines had already been built in the 17th century by Pascal and Leibniz. Babbage and Ada Lovelace built bigger computing machines in Victorian Britain. Cash registers were already performing arithmetic operations in every shop at the beginning of the 20th century. But to achieve programmable electronic calculators – much faster and more adaptable than earlier machines – several theoretical and technical advances had to be made first. On the theoretical side, as early as 1937, Turing had described an abstract automaton capable of performing any calculation defined by a program. On the technical side, by the early 20th century, diodes, or vacuum tubes, had enabled fine control of electron flows. Used in the first computers, these bulky, energy-hungry components were later replaced by transistors and then printed circuits in the race for speed and miniaturization that marked the electronics industry. A decisive step was taken by Claude Shannon in 1938, when he demonstrated the correlation between logical calculation and the arrangement of electrical circuits, at the confluence of the conceptual and the perceptible. An open or closed switch corresponds to « true » or « false », a series arrangement of switches corresponds to the logical operator « and », a parallel arrangement to the operator « or exclusive ». The connectors no, and, or suffice to express Boolean algebra, i.e. the formalization of ordinary logic. Base-two arithmetic (0, 1) also lends itself well to electronic calculation. Passing through logic gates, running through the labyrinth of circuits formed and reformed by programs, lightning-fast, the electron becomes a signifier. Automating the manipulation of virtual meaning by mechanizing that of the actual sign – such is the power of computer coding.\n\nIn just a few generations, digital technology would become the meta-medium of social communication. From 1955 to 1975, large mainframe computers were used only by large government agencies and for scientific computing. Less than one thousandth of the world’s population was in direct contact with these « electronic brains », as they were then called. From 1975 to 1995, e-mail became commonplace, and Internet-connected personal computers boosted the productivity of the creative class and white-collar workers. One percent of the world’s population is connected in the late twentieth century. From 1995 to 2015, the Web establishes itself as the new public sphere, gradually absorbing previous media. Smartphones nestle in our pockets and on our bedside tables. Half the world’s population resonates with social media. In the 2020s, American and Chinese operators of large data centers dominate global communication. Artificial intelligence is at the helm of a digital environment in which almost the entire human population is immersed.\n\nDigital stigmergy\n\nLess than a century after the invention of the first computers, the world’s memory is digitized, accessible to much of the population via the Internet. A piece of information found at one point on the network can be found anywhere. From static text on paper, we have moved on to ubiquitous hypertext, then to the surrealist architext that brings together all symbols. A virtual memory has begun to grow, secreted by billions of living and dead people, teeming with languages, music and images, full of dreams and fantasies, blending science and lies. While point-to-point messages are still exchanged, most social communication now takes place via electronic stigmergy. Immersed in digital space, we communicate via the oceanic mass of data that brings us together. Every link we create, every tag or hashtag we affix to a piece of information, every act of rating or approval, every « like », every query, every purchase, every comment, every share – all these operations subtly modify the shared memory, i.e. the inextricable magma of relationships between data. Our online behavior emits a continual flow of messages and cues that transform the structure of memory, helping to direct the attention and activity of our contemporaries. We deposit electronic pheromones in the virtual environment, which in turn determine the actions of other Internet users and train the formal neurons of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nArtificial intelligence and memory\n\nThe biological brain abstracts the details of actual experience into schemas of interactions, or concepts, encoded by patterns of neural circuitry. In the same way, AI’s neural models condense the countless data stored in digital memory. They virtualize actual data into patterns and patterns of patterns. Conditioned by their training, AI systems can then recognize and reproduce data corresponding to the learned patterns. But because they have abstracted structures rather than recording everything, here they are, able to correctly conceptualize forms (of image, text, music, code…) they have never encountered before, and produce an infinite number of new symbolic arrangements. Patterns hidden in the myriad layers and connections of electronic brains rain down unprecedented actualizations. This is why we speak of « generative artificial intelligence ». Neural AI synthesizes and mobilizes the common memory accumulated over the centuries. Far from being autonomous, it extends and amplifies a stigmergic collective intelligence. Millions of users contribute to perfecting the models by asking them questions and commenting on the answers they receive. We sow data to harvest meaning.\n\nDoes the electronic calculation that simulates the functioning of neurons give rise to an autonomous consciousness? No, because machines only manipulate the material part of symbols, and images, texts and melodies only have meaning for us when they are emitted at interfaces. No, because phenomenal experience is the counterpart of an animal organism, and intelligible meaning only appears to the person who has steeped himself in a culture. Humans participate in the mind because they inhabit a living body. On the other side of the mirror, signifiers swirl blindly, pebbles clatter on the great abacus, a senseless electronic fury rages in the data centers. On this side of the mirror, monitors present us with the face of another who speaks, but it’s an anthropomorphic projection. A library doesn’t remember any more than an algorithm thinks: both virtualize cognitive functions through externalization, transformation, pooling and re-internalization. The new electronic brains synthesize and put to work the enormous digital memory through which we remember, communicate and think together. Behind « the machine » lies the human collective intelligence that it reifies and mobilizes.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAlmost 30 years ago now, I published a book dedicated to digital-based collective intelligence which was, modesty aside, the first to address this topic. In this work, I predicted that the Internet would become the main medium of communication, that it would bring about a change in civilization, and I said that the best use we could make of digital technologies was to enhance collective intelligence (and let me add: an emerging, ‘bottom-up’ type of collective intelligence).\n\nAt that time, less than 1% of humanity was connected to the Internet, while today – in 2023 – we have exceeded two-thirds of the world’s population being online. The change in civilization seems quite evident, although it is normally necessary to wait several generations to confirm this type of shift, not to mention that we are only at the beginning of the digital revolution. As for the enhancement of collective intelligence, many steps have been taken to make knowledge accessible to all (Wikipedia, open-source software, digitized libraries and museums, open-access scientific articles, certain aspects of social media, etc.). But much remains to be done. Using artificial intelligence to enhance collective intelligence seems a promising path, but how do we proceed in this direction? To answer this question rigorously, I will need to define a few concepts beforehand.\n\nWHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?\n\nBefore even addressing the relationship between human collective intelligence and artificial intelligence, let’s try to define in a few words intelligence in general and human intelligence in particular. It is often said that intelligence is the ability to solve problems. To which I respond: yes, but it is also and above all the ability to conceive or construct problems. If one has a problem, it means one is trying to achieve a certain result and is faced with a difficulty or obstacle. In other words, there is a “Self”, which has its own internal logic, which must maintain within certain homeostatic limits, which has immanent goals such as reproduction, feeding, or development, and there is an « Other », an exteriority, which follows a different logic, which merges with or belongs to the environment of the Self and with which the Self must negotiate. The intelligent entity must have a certain autonomy, otherwise it would not be intelligent at all, but this autonomy is not self-sufficiency or absolute independence because, in that case, it would have no problems to solve and would not need to be intelligent. »\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe relationship between the Self and the Other (Figure 1) can be reduced to communication or interaction between entities that are governed by different ways of being, codes, and heterogeneous purposes, thus imposing an uncertain and improvable process of encoding and decoding. This process inevitably generates losses, creations, and is subject to all kinds of noise and interference.\n\nThe intelligent entity is not necessarily an individual; it can be a society or an ecosystem. Moreover, upon analysis, one will often find in its place an ecosystem of molecules, cells, neurons, cognitive modules, and so on. As for the relationship between the Self and the Other, it constitutes the elementary mesh of any ecosystemic network. Intelligence is the trait of an ecosystem in relation with other ecosystems; it is collective by nature. In summary, the problem comes down to optimizing communication with a heterogeneous Other based on the purposes of the Self, and the solution is none other than the actual history of their relations.\n\nINTELLIGENCE COMPLEXITY LAYERS\n\nOur main focus is on human intelligence enhanced by digital technology. Let’s not forget, however, that our intelligence is based on layers of complexity that predate the appearance of the Homo species on Earth (Figure 2). The complexity layers of organic and animal intelligence are still active and indispensable to our own intelligence, since we are living beings with an organism and animals with a nervous system. That’s why human intelligence is always embodied and situated.\n\nFigure 2\n\nWith organisms come the well-known properties of self-reproduction, self-reference and self-repair, based on molecular communication and no doubt also complex forms of electromagnetic communication. I won’t go into the subject of organic intelligence here. Suffice it to say that some researchers in biology and ecology now speak of » vegetal cognition « .\n\nThe development of the nervous system stems from the need for locomotion. First, the sensory-motor loop must be ensured. Over the course of evolution, this reflex loop became more complex, involving simulation of the environment, evaluation of the situation and decision-making calculations leading to action. Animal intelligence results from the folding of organic intelligence upon itself, as the nervous system maps and synthesizes what is happening in the organism, and controls it in return. Phenomenal experience is born of this reflection.\n\nIndeed, the nervous system produces a phenomenal experience, or consciousness, which is characterized by intentionality, i.e. the fact of relating to something that is not necessarily the animal itself. Animal intelligence represents the Other. It is inhabited by multimodal sensory images (cenesthesia, touch, taste, smell, hearing, sight), pleasure and pain, emotions, the spatio-temporal framing essential to locomotion, the relationship to a territory, and an often complex social communication. Clearly, animals are capable of recognizing prey, predators or sexual partners and acting accordingly. This is only possible because neural circuits encode interaction patterns or concepts that orient, coordinate and give meaning to phenomenal experience.\n\nHUMAN INTELLIGENCE\n\nI’ve just mentioned animal intelligence, which is based on the nervous system. How can we characterize human intelligence, supported by symbolic coding? The general categories, concepts and patterns of interaction that were simply encoded by neural circuits in animal intelligence are now also represented in phenomenal experience via symbolic systems, the most important of which is language (Figure 3). Meaningful images (speech, writing, visual representations, ritual gestures…) represent abstract concepts, and these concepts can be syntactically combined to form complex semantic architectures.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAs a result, most dimensions of human phenomenal experience – including sensori-motricity, affectivity, spatio-temporality and memory – are projected onto symbolic systems and controlled in turn by symbolic thought. Human intelligence and consciousness are reflexive. Moreover, for symbolic thought to take shape, symbolic systems – which are always of social origin – must be internalized by individuals, becoming an integral part of their psyche and « hard-wired » into their nervous systems. As a result, symbolic communication directly engages human nervous systems. We can’t fail to understand what someone is saying if we know the language. And the effects on our emotions and mental representations are almost inevitable. We could also take the example of the psycho-physical and affective synchronization produced by music. This is why human social cohesion is at least as strong as that of eusocial animals like bees and ants.\n\nNote that figure 3, like several figures that follow, evokes a partition and interdependence between the virtual and the actual. In 1995, I published a book on the virtual that was both a philosophical and anthropological meditation on the concept of virtuality, and an attempt to put this concept to work on contemporary objects. My philosophical thesis is simple: that which is only possible, but not realized, does not exist. By contrast, that which is virtual but not actualized does exist. The virtual, that which is potential, abstract, immaterial, informational or ideal, weighs on situations, conditions our choices, provokes effects and enters into a dialectic or interdependent relationship with the actual.\n\nCOLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE ECOSYSTEMS\n\nFigure 4 maps the main hubs of collective human intelligence or, if you prefer, the culture that comes with symbolic thinking. The diagram is organized by two intersecting symmetries. The first – binary – symmetry is that of the virtual and the actual. The actual is immersed in space and time, and is rather concrete, whereas the virtual is rather abstract and has no spatio-temporal address. The second – ternary – symmetry is that of sign, being and thing, inspired by the semiotic triangle. The thing is what the sign represents, and the being is the subject for whom the sign represents the thing. To the left (sign) stand symbolic systems, knowledge and communication; in the middle (being) stand subjectivity, ethics and society; to the right (thing) extend the capacity to do, the economy, technology and the physical dimension. It’s all about collective intelligence, because the six vertices of the hexagon are interdependent: the green lines (relationships) are as important, if not more so, than the points where they end.\n\nFigure 4\n\nThis framework is valid for society in general, but also for any particular community. By the way, virtual, actual, sign, being and thing are (along with void) the semantic primitives of the IEML language (Information Economy MetaLanguage) that I invented and of which I’ll say a few words below.\n\nThe six vertices of the hexagon are not only the main fulcrums of human collective intelligence, they are also universes of problems to be solved:\n\nproblems of knowledge creation and learning\n\ncommunication problems\n\nproblems of legislation and ethics\n\nsocial and political problems\n\neconomic problems\n\ntechnical, health and environmental problems.\n\nHow can we solve these problems?\n\nTHE SELF-ORGANIZING CYCLE OF COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE\n\nFigure 5 shows a four-stage problem-solving cycle. For each of the four phases of the cycle (deliberation, decision, action and observation), there are many different procedures, depending on the traditions and contexts in which collective intelligence operates. You’ll notice that deliberation represents the virtual phase of the cycle, while action represents the actual phase. In this model, decision is the transition from the virtual to the actual, while observation is the transition from the actual to the virtual. I’d like to emphasize two concepts here – deliberation and memory – which are often overlooked in this context.\n\nFigure 5\n\nLet’s begin by stressing the importance of deliberation, which involves not only discussing the best solutions for overcoming obstacles, but also constructing and conceptualizing problems collaboratively. This conceptualization phase will strongly influence and even define many of the subsequent phases, and will also determine the organization of the memory.\n\nAs you can see from the diagram in Figure 5, memory lies at the heart of the collective intelligence self-organization. Shared memory supports each phase of the cycle, helping to maintain the coordination, coherence and identity of collective intelligence. Indirect communication via a shared environment is one of the main mechanisms underpinning the collective intelligence of insect societies, known as stigmergic communication in the vocabulary of ethologists. But whereas insects generally leave pheromone traces in their physical environments to guide the actions of their fellow creatures, we leave symbolic traces not only in the landscape, but also in specialized memory devices such as archives, libraries and, today, databases. The problem of the future of digital memory lies before us: how can we design this memory in such a way that it is as useful as possible to our collective intelligence?\n\nTOWARDS AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT THE SERVICE OF COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE\n\nHaving acquired a few notions about intelligence in general, the foundations of human intelligence and the complexity of our collective intelligence, we can now ask ourselves about the relationship between our intelligence and machines.\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 6 provides an overview of our situation. In the middle, the « living »: human populations, with the actual bodies and virtual minds of individuals. Immediately in contact with the individuals, the hardware machines (or mechanical bodies) on the actual side and, on the virtual side, the software machines (or mechanical minds). Hardware machines increasingly play the role of interface or medium between us and terrestrial ecosystems. As for software machines, they are becoming the main intermediary – a medium once again – between human populations and the ecosystems of ideas with which we live in symbiosis. As for collective consciousness, we’re not there yet. It’s more a horizon, a direction to aim for, than a reality. We need to understand Figure 6 by mentally adding feedback loops or interdependencies between adjacent layers, between the virtual and the actual, between the mechanical and the living. On an ethical level, we can assume that living human communities receive the benefits of terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystems of ideas in proportion to the work and care they put into maintaining them.\n\nINTELLIGENCE AUTOMATION\n\nLet’s zoom in on our mechanical environment with Figure 7. A machine is a technical device built by humans, an automaton that moves or operates « by itself ». Today, the two types of machine – software and hardware – are interdependent. They could not exist without each other, and are in principle controlled by human communities, whose physical and mental capacities they augment. Because technology externalizes, socializes and reifies human organic and psychic functions, it can sometimes appear autonomous or at risk of becoming autonomous, but this is an optical illusion. Behind « the machine » lies collective intelligence and the social relations it reifies and mobilizes.\n\nFigure 7\n\nMechanical machines are those that transform motion, starting with the sail, the wheel, the pulley, the lever, gears, springs and so on. Examples of purely mechanical machines include water or windmills, classical clocks, Renaissance printing presses or the first weaving looms.\n\nEnergetic machines are those that transform energy into heat or electricity. Examples include furnaces, forges, steam engines, internal combustion engines, electric motors, and contemporary processes for generating, transmitting and storing electricity.\n\nAs for electronic machines, they control energy and matter at the level of electromagnetic fields and elementary particles, and very often serve to control the lower-layer machines on which they also depend. For our purposes here, these are mainly data centers (the « cloud »), networks and devices that are in direct contact with end-users (the « edge »), such as computers, telephones, games consoles, virtual reality headsets and the like.\n\nLet’s take a look at the virtual part, which corresponds to the shared memory we put at the heart of our description of the self-organizing cycle of collective action. While point-to-point messages are still exchanged, most social communication now takes place stigmergically in digital memory. We communicate via the oceanic mass of data that brings us together. Every link we create, every tag or hashtag affixed to a piece of information, every act of evaluation or approval, every « like », every request, every purchase, every comment, every share – all these operations subtly modify the common memory, i.e. the inextricable magma of relationships between data. Our online behavior emits a continual flow of messages and clues that transform the structure of memory, help direct the attention and activity of our contemporaries, and drive artificial intelligence. But all this is happening today in a rather opaque way, which doesn’t do justice to the necessary phase of deliberation and conscious conceptualization that would be that of an ideal collective intelligence.\n\nAbove all, memory comprises the data that is produced, retrieved, explored and exploited by human activity. Human-machine interfaces represent the « front-end » without which nothing is possible. They directly determine what we call the user experience. Between interfaces and data, there are two main types of artificial intelligence models: neural models and symbolic models. We saw above that « natural » human intelligence is based on neural and symbolic coding. We find these two types of coding, or rather their electronic transposition, at the digital memory layer. It’s worth noting that these two approaches, neural and symbolic, already existed in the early days of AI, as early as the middle of the 20th century.\n\nThe neural models are trained on the multitude of digital data available, and they automatically extract patterns that no human programmer would have been able to work out. Conditioned by their training, the algorithms can then recognize and produce data corresponding to the learned patterns. But because they have abstracted structures rather than recording everything, they are now capable of correctly categorizing forms (image, text, music, code…) they have never encountered before, and producing an infinite number of new symbolic arrangements. This is why we speak of generative artificial intelligence. Neural AI synthesizes and mobilizes shared memory. Far from being autonomous, it extends and amplifies the collective intelligence that produced the data. What’s more, millions of users contribute to perfecting the models by asking them questions and commenting on the answers they receive. Take Midjourney, for example, whose users exchange prompts and constantly improve their AI skills. Today, Midjourney’s Discord servers are the most populous on the planet, with over a million users. A similar phenomenon is beginning to unfold around DALLE 3. A new stigmergic collective intelligence is emerging from the fusion of social media, AI and creator communities. These are examples of conscious contributions of collective human intelligence to artificial intelligence systems.\n\nMany generalist pre-trained models are open-source, and several methods are now being used to refine or adjust them to particular contexts, whether based on elaborate prompts, additional training with special data or by means of human feedback, or a combination of these methods. In short, we now have the first beginnings of a neural collective intelligence, which emerges from a statistical calculation on data. However, neural models, useful and practical as they may be, are unfortunately not reliable knowledge bases. They inevitably reflect common opinion and the biases inherent in the data. Because of their probabilistic nature, they are prone to all kinds of errors. Finally, they don’t know how to justify their results, and this opacity is not conducive to building confidence. Critical thinking is therefore more necessary than ever, especially if training data is increasingly produced by generative AI, creating a dangerous epistemological vicious circle.\n\nLet’s turn now to symbolic models. We call them by various names: tag collections, classifications, ontologies, knowledge graphs or semantic networks. These models can be reduced to explicit concepts and equally explicit relationships between these concepts, including causal relationships. They allow data to be organized semantically according to the practical needs of user communities, and enable automatic reasoning. With this approach, we obtain reliable, explicable knowledge that is directly adapted to the intended use. Symbolic knowledge bases are wonderful ways of sharing knowledge and skills, and therefore excellent tools for collective intelligence. The problem is that ontologies or knowledge graphs are created « by hand ». Formal modeling of complex knowledge domains is difficult. The construction of these models is time-consuming for highly specialized experts and therefore costly. The productivity of this intellectual work is low. On the other hand, while there is interoperability at the level of file formats for semantic metadata (or classification systems), this interoperability does not exist at the semantic level of concepts, which compartmentalizes collective intelligence. Wikidata is used for encyclopedic applications, schema.org for websites, the CIDOC-CRM model for cultural institutions, and so on. There are hundreds of incompatible ontologies from one domain to another, and often even within the same domain.\n\nFor years, many researchers have been advocating the use of hybrid neuro-symbolic models, in order to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. My message is as follows. If we want to move towards a digitally-supported collective intelligence worthy of the name, and which keeps up with our contemporary technical possibilities, we need to:\n\n1) Renew symbolic AI by increasing the productivity of formal modeling and decompartmentalizing semantic metadata.\n\n2) Couple this renewed symbolic AI with neural AI, which is in full development.\n\n3) Put this previously unseen hybrid AI at the service of collective intelligence.\n\nIEML : FOR A SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE BASE\n\nWe have automated and pooled pattern recognition and automatic pattern generation, which is more neural in nature. How can we automate and pool conceptualization, which is more symbolic in nature? How can we bring together formal conceptualization by living humans and the pattern recognition that emerges from statistics?\n\nFigure 8\n\nBecause our collective intelligence is increasingly based on a shared digital memory, I’ve been looking over the last thirty years for a semantic coordinate system for digital memory, a metadata system that would automate conceptualization operations and enable conceptual models to be shared.\n\nThe only thing that can generate all the concepts we want, while maintaining mutual understanding, is a language. But natural languages are irregular and ambiguous, and their semantics cannot be computed. So I built a language – IEML (Information Economy MetaLanguage) – whose internal semantic relations are functions of syntactic relations. IEML is both a language and an algebra. It is designed to facilitate and automate the construction of symbolic models as far as possible, while ensuring their semantic interoperability. In short, it’s a tool for automating and sharing conceptualization, with the vocation of serving as a universal semantic metadata system.\n\nWe can now answer our main question: how can we use artificial intelligence to increase collective intelligence? We need to imagine an ecosystem of semantic knowledge bases organized according to the architecture described in figure 8. As you can see, there are three layers between the human-machine interface and the data. In the center, the semantic metadata layer organizes the data on a symbolic level and, thanks to its algebraic structure, enables all kinds of uniform logical, analogical and semantic calculations. We know that symbolic modeling is difficult, and today’s ontology editors don’t make it easy. That’s why, under the metadata layer, I’m proposing to use a neural model to translate natural sign systems into IEML and vice versa, which would facilitate the most intuitive editing and inspection of semantic models. Between the metadata layer and the data layer, a neural model will enable the automatic generation of data from IEML prompts. In the opposite direction, the neural model would automatically classify the data and integrate it into the semantic model of the user community. Note that the algebraic properties of IEML are particularly aimed at perfecting machine learning.\n\nThe immersive human-machine interface using natural signs would enable anyone to collaborate in the conceptualization of models at the level of semantic metadata, and to generate the appropriate data by means of transparent prompts. Finally, this knowledge base would automate data categorization, exploitation and multimedia exploration.\n\nSuch an approach would enable each community to organize itself according to its own semantic model, while supporting the comparison and exchange of concepts and sub-models. In short, an ecosystem of semantic knowledge bases using IEML would simultaneously maximize (1) increased intellectual productivity through partial automation of conceptualization, (2) transparency of models and explicability of results, so important from an ethical point of view, (3) pooling of models and data thanks to a common semantic coordinate system, and (4) diversity and creative freedom, since the networks of concepts formulated in IEML can be differentiated and complexified at will. A fine program for collective intelligence. My wish is for a digital memory that will enable us to cultivate diverse and fertile ecosystems of ideas and reap the maximum benefits for human development.\n\nSOME REFERENCES\n\nLevy, Pierre. “Semantic Computing with IEML.” Collective Intelligence, 2023. 40 p.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26339137231207634\n\nLévy, Pierre. “Pour Un Changement de Paradigme en Intelligence Artificielle.” Giornale Di Filosofia 2, no. 2 (2021).\n\nhttps://mimesisjournals.com/ojs/index.php/giornale-filosofia/article/view/1693\n\nLévy, Pierre.

I will begin by discussing the anthropological and demographic context of the public sphere shift into the digital environment. Then I will analyze the original forms of memory and communication supported by the new medium. I will then evoke the figures of domination and alienation specific to the new public sphere. I will finish, as it should be, with some emancipatory perspectives.\n\n1 Context\n\nA new era in culture\n\nOne of the main factors in the evolution of ideas ecosystems lies in the material devices of production and reproduction of symbols, but also in the « software » systems of writing and coding information. In the course of history, symbols (and the ideas they carry) have been successively perpetuated by writing, lightened by the alphabet and paper, and multiplied by printing and electrical media. At each stage, new political forms have emerged: palaces-temples and first states with writing, empires and cities with the alphabet or paper, nation states with printing and electronic media.\n\nNowadays symbols are digitized and computed, i.e. a host of software robots – the algorithms – record, count, translate and extract patterns from these symbols. Symbolic objects (texts, still or moving images, voices, music, programs, etc.) are not only recorded, reproduced and transmitted automatically, they are also transformed and generated in an industrial way. In short, cultural evolution has brought us to the point where ecosystems of ideas manifest themselves as algorithmically animated data in a ubiquitous virtual space. And it is in this space that social ties are formed, maintained and unraveled, where the dramas of the polis are now played out…\n\nThe demographic shift\n\nThe hypothesis of a quick and large-scale anthropological change is based on uncontroversial quantitative data.\n\nAccess to computers\n\nRegarding access to computers, we can consider that 0.1 percent of the world’s population had direct access to a computer in 1975 (before the personal computer revolution). This proportion was 20% in rich countries in 1990 (before the Web revolution). In 2022, for European countries, the proportion oscillated between 65% (Greece) and 95% (Luxembourg). Note that these figures do not take into account smart phones.\n\nInternet access\n\nThe proportion of the world’s population that had access to the Internet was about 1% in 1990 (before the Web), 4% in 1999, 24% in 2009, 51% in 2018 and 65% in 2023. According to the International Telecommunications Organization, about 5 billion people are Internet users today. Still for 2023, but only in Europe, the proportion of the population connected to the Internet amounts to 93% (data of the European Union).\n\nNews\n\nTo complete these statistics with some data more directly related to politics, 40% of Europeans and 50% of Americans and Canadians read the news through social media (I do mean social media, not the Internet in general). It is more than 50% everywhere under forty years old. For specific data on reading newspapers versus reading text online: 80% of those under thirty read news online (Pew Research Center data).\n\n2 Digital memory and communication\n\nThe new public sphere\n\nIn short, less than a century after the invention of the first computers, more than sixty-five percent of the world’s population is connected to the Internet and the world’s memory is digitized. If a piece of information is found at one point of the network, it is everywhere. From static text on paper, we have moved on to ubiquitous hypertext, and then to the surrealist Architext gathering all symbols. A virtual memory has begun to grow, secreted by the living and the dead in billions, teeming with languages, music and images, full of dreams and fantasies, mixing science and lies. The new publ­ic sphere is multimedia, interactive, global, fractal, stigmergic and – from now on – mediated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe new public sphere is global. Both the web and major social media like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Reddit, etc. are international and multilingual. Machine translation has reached a point where we can now understand, with a few errors, what someone writes in another language. I would add that, in parallel to translation, the automatic synthesis of long texts is progressing, which adds to the porosity of the various cognitive and semantic bubbles.\n\nThe digital public sphere is fractal, that is, it is subdivided into subgroups, which in turn are subdivided into subgroups, and so on recursively, with all imaginable combinations and intersections. These subdivisions intersect with distinctions of platforms, languages, geographical areas, interests, political orientations, etc. Examples include Facebook or LinkedIn groups, Discord servers, You-tube or Telegram channels, Reddit communities, etc.\n\nStigmergic collective intelligence\n\nWhile point-to-point message exchange still takes place, most social communication now takes place in a stigmergic manner. The notion of stigmergy is one of the keys to understanding the functioning of the digital public sphere. We distinguish traditionally three communication patterns: one-one, one-many and many-many. The one-one pattern corresponds to dialogue, the classic postal mail or the traditional telephone. The one-many scheme describes a central editor/transmitter sending his messages to many so-called « passive » receivers. This last scheme corresponds to the press, the recording industry, the radio and the television. The Internet represents a breakthrough because it allows all participants to transmit to a large number of receivers in a decentralized « many-to-many » networked scheme. This last description is nevertheless misleading. Indeed, if everyone transmits for everyone (which is the case), not everyone can listen to everyone. What happens in reality is that Internet users contribute to a common memory and in return become aware of the content of this memory through automated search and selection procedures. These are the famous algorithms of Google, (Page Rank), Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (recommendations), etc.\n\nIts Greek etymology explains the meaning of the word « stigmergy » quite well: marks (stigma) are left in the environment by the action or work (ergon) of members of a community, and these marks in turn guide their actions, and so on recursively. The classic case is that of ants leaving a trail of pheromones in their wake as they bring food back to the anthill. The smell of the pheromones incites other ants to follow their tracks to discover the booty and bring food back to the underground city by leaving a scented message on the ground as well.\n\nIt can be argued that any form of writing that is not precisely addressed is a form of stigmergic communication: traces are deposited for future reading and act as the external memory of a community. The phenomenon is old but it took a new extent since the turn of the century. Immersed in the new digital public sphere, we communicate through the oceanic mass of data that brings us together. Wikipedia’s encyclopedists and GitHub’s programmers collaborate through the same database. Unbeknownst to us, every link we create, every tag or hashtag placed on a piece of information, every act of rating or approval, every « like, » every request, every purchase, every comment, every share, all of these operations subtly modify the common memory, that is, the inextricable magma of relationships between data. Our online behavior emits a continuous flow of messages and clues that transform the structure of memory and contribute to directing the attention and activity of our fellow internet users. In an endless loop, we deposit in the virtual environment some electronic pheromones which determine the action of other Internet users and train the formal neurons of artificial intelligences (AI).\n\nThe role of Artificial Intelligence in the new public sphere\n\nThe biological brain abstracts the details of actual experiences into schemas of interactions, or concepts, encoded by patterns of neural circuits. In the same way, the neural models of AI condense the countless data of digital memory. They compress the actual data into patterns and patterns of patterns. Conditioned by their training, the algorithms can then recognize and reproduce data corresponding to the learned patterns. But because they have abstracted structures rather than recorded everything, they are able to conceptualize correctly some forms (of image, text, music, code…) that they have never encountered and to produce an infinity of new symbolic arrangements. This is why we speak about generative artificial intelligence.\n\nDigital memory is detached from its place of origin and reception, pooled, waiting to be read, suspended in the « clouds » of the Internet, embedded in software. This mass of data is now virtualized by neural models. And the patterns hidden in the myriad layers and connections of electronic brains rain down novel symbolic objects. We only sow data to harvest meaning.\n\nAI offers us a new access to the global digital memory. It is also a way to mobilize this memory to automate increasingly complex symbolic operations, involving the interaction of heterogeneous semantic universes and accounting systems.\n\n3 The dark side\n\nThe platform state and the new cloud bureaucracy\n\nIf the preceding analyses have any validity, political power is largely played out in the digital public sphere. And its ultimate control lies « in the clouds », in the hands of the celestial bureaucracies that calculate social interactions and memory. The clouds, that is, the networks of data centers owned by the oligopoly of GAFAM, BATX, big social media and company. This is why the contenders for global political hegemony, mainly the Americans and the Chinese, ally themselves with the data lords – or subjugate them – because the digital oligarchs hold the material control of the world’s memory and the public sphere. They alone, moreover, have the storage capacity and computational power to train the so-called « foundational » general AI models. What I call a « Platform State » results from the intertwining of a political superpower with a fraction of the digital oligarchy.\n\nCloud bureaucracy is more efficient than the nation-state bureaucracy inherited from the age of printing. Already, several governmental or regalian functions are provided by large platforms or by « decentralized » digital networks. The following list is not closed :\n\n– Verification of people’s identity, facial recognition\n\n– Mapping and cadastre\n\n– Money creation\n\n– Market regulation\n\n– Education and research\n\n– Fusion of defense and cyber-defense\n\n– Control of the public sphere, censorship, propaganda, “nudge”\n\n– Surveillance\n\n– Biosurveillance\n\nSocial media : addictions and manipulations\n\nOur allegiance to the data lords comes from the power of their computing centers, their software efficiency and the simplicity of their interfaces. It is also rooted in our addiction to a toxic socio-technical architecture, which uses the dopaminergic stimulation and addictive narcissistic reinforcements of digital communication to make us produce more and more data. We know how much the mental health of adolescent populations is at risk from this point of view. In addition to the biopolitics evoked by Michel Foucault, we must now consider a psychopolitics based on neuromarketing, personal data and gamification of control.\n\nWe should get used to it: the polis has moved into the great global database of the Internet. As a result, power struggles – all power struggles, be they economic, political or cultural – are replayed and complicated in the new digital space. On the slippery terrain of social media, the opposing camps have their armies of trolls coordinated in real time, equipped with the latest bots, informed by automatic data analysis and augmented by machine learning. In the raging worldwide civil war, with domestic and foreign politics inextricably intertwined, the new mercenaries are the influencers.\n\nBut all these novelties do not invalidate the classic rules of propaganda, which are still valid today: continuous repetition, simplicity of the catchwords, memorable images, emotional provocation and identity resonance. No one has forgotten Machiavelli’s wise advice on how to get the enemy to destroy himself: « Secret warfare consists of taking the confidence of a divided city, mediating between the two parties until they come to arms: and when the sword is finally drawn, giving carefully measured help to the weaker party, as much with the aim of making the war last and letting them be consumed by each other, as to guard against revealing one’s intention of oppressing and subduing them both equally, by a too massive help. If you follow this course carefully, you will almost always reach your goal. »[1]\n\nWith our heads down on our smartphones, we spin in a loop the stereotypes that reinforce our fragmented identities and our short memories under the snide gaze of intoxication experts, subsidized communicators, marketing specialists and geopolitical agents of influence…\n\nAI and cultural domination\n\nLet’s continue this review of the dark sides of the new public sphere with the issues of cultural domination linked to Artificial Intelligence. There is a lot of talk about the « biases » of this or that model of artificial intelligence, as if there could be a non-biased or neutral AI. This question is all the more important because, as I suggested above, AI is becoming our new interface with symbolic objects: universal pen, panoramic glasses, general speaker, codeless programmer, personal assistant. The large generalist language models produced by dominant platforms are now akin to a public infrastructure, a new layer of the digital meta-medium. These generalist models can be inexpensively specialized with domain-specific datasets and adjustment methods. They can also be equipped with fact-checked knowledge bases.\n\nThe results provided by an AI are thus the result of several factors that all contribute to its orientation or, if you like, its « biases ».\n\na) The algorithms themselves select the types of statistical calculations and neural network structures.\n\nb) The training data favor the languages, cultures, philosophical options, political biases and prejudices of all kinds of those who produced them.\n\nc) In order to align the AI’s responses with the supposed goals of the users, the inclinations of the data are corrected (or accentuated!) « by hand » through what is called RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-back).\n\nd) Finally, as with any tool, the user determines the results by means of instructions in natural language (the famous prompts) It should be noted that communities of users collaboratively exchange and improve such instructions.\n\nThe power of these systems is matched only by their complexity, their heterogeneity and their opacity. Regulatory control of AI, while undoubtedly necessary, seems difficult.\n\n4 Emancipation perspectives\n\nDigital literacy and critical thinking\n\nDespite all of the above, the public sphere of the 21st century is more open than that of the 20th century: citizens in democratic countries enjoy a great deal of freedom of expression and can choose their sources of information from a wide range of thematic specializations, languages and political orientations. This freedom of expression and information, the new distributed power of data creation and analysis, not to mention the possibilities of social coordination offered by the new medium, all represent emancipatory potential. But only a true education to critical thinking in the new communication environment will actualize this potential of renewed citizenship. To set the record straight, a BBC study recently showed that half of young people aged 12 to 16 believe news shared on social media without checking them. And we know from experience that children are not the only gullible subjects. Ideally, the new critical thinking education should teach future citizens to organize themselves as small, autonomous intelligence agencies that prioritize their interests, carefully select diverse sources, analyze data based on explicit hypotheses, and maintain a relevant classification of their personal digital memory. They must learn to discern data sources in terms of organizing categories, dominant narratives, and agendas. The basic journalistic reflex of cross-referencing sources identified in this way will be instilled. Finally, students should be trained in collective stigmergic intelligence and collaborative learning.\n\nFor a governance of the digital public sphere\n\nI will limit myself here to indicating a few major orientations for the necessary governance of the new public sphere, rather than determining precisely the means to achieve it. While steering in heavy weather may require many detours, the course is clear: it is a matter of perfecting, as much as possible, the reflexive dimension of a collective intelligence already in action.\n\na) In support of this goal, transparency of online processes seems a sine qua non. In particular, but not only, I am aiming at a clear, brief and natural language description of AI training algorithms and data.\n\nb) Following the example of Wikimedia, let us strive to maximize the knowledge commons.\n\nc) Let’s open up the data sets and algorithms along the lines of the free software movement.\n\nd) Let’s ensure the practical and legal sovereignty of individuals and groups over the data they produce.\n\ne) Finally, let’s decentralize the governance of online interactions by promoting consensual procedures. The social movement that supports the blockchain indicates a possible path here.\n\nIn order to contribute to the project of a collective reflexive intelligence I invented a language (read the peer reviewed scientific paper: IEML, Information Economy MetaLanguage) having the same capacity of expression and translation as natural languages but which also has the regularity of an algebra, thus allowing a calculation of semantics. This language could serve as a semantic coordinate system for the new public sphere. It would thus contribute to transform the digital memory into a mirror of our collective intelligences. From then on, a more fluid feedback loop between the ecosystems of ideas and the communities that sustain them would bring us closer to the ideal of a reflexive collective intelligence at the service of human development and a renewed democracy. This is not to entertain any illusion about the possibility of total transparency, but rather to open the way to the critical exploration of an infinite universe of meaning.\n\n[1] Discours sur la première décade de Tite-Live. La Pléiade, Gallimard, Paris, p. 588, my translation.\n\nThis blogpost reproduces my keynote speech at IJCLR’22 & NeSy’22.\n\nThe Video (45 mn) is here. A longer academic paper diving deep into linguistics, collective intelligence and artificial intelligence issues can be found here.\n\nThe topic of this communication is IEML, a language that I have invented, called the Information Economy Metalanguage. This language has the expressive power of a natural language and it is also a mathematical category, or an algebra.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLike several philosophers before me (Leibniz, Peirce, Saussure, Wittgenstein, Chomsky…), I have been passionate since my early youth about the question of meaning : What is it? How does it work? And how far had we gone in the mathematization of language and in the calculation of concepts? When I say mathematization of language, I mean algebraic modelling, not statistical approximation.\n\nIn the early 1990’s, I understood that the internet would become the main communication medium. It became obvious for me that the growth of computing power would augment language and cognition, like writing, printing and electronic media’s revolutions did previously. Even before the advent of the web I knew that the future of text would be dynamic hypertext. And finally, I foresaw that a common digital memory would be able to support a new kind of large scale collective intelligence.\n\nIf all this was true, we needed to create a unifying semantic coordinate system, a digital native language that would lend itself to calculation and programming. What remained was to solve the problem of the mathematization of semantics. But what are semantics, exactly? Let’s distinguish between three aspects of semantics: first a pragmatic aspect, second a referential or logical aspect, and third a linguistic aspect. These three aspects are simultaneous and interdependant.\n\nFor the pragmatic semantics the meaning of a speech is its effect on a social situation. It depends on social games, it is about relevance, and it is a matter of sociology and game theory\n\nFor the referential semantics, the meaning is the reality or the reference that is designated by the speech. It is about truth, and it is a matter of logic.\n\nFor the linguistic semantics, the meaning of a speech emerges from the sense of its words and their grammatical organization: it is mainly about conceptualization, and it is a matter of linguistics.\n\nLinguistic semantics are obviously the basis on which the other aspects are built, and that is why I decided to construct a language that would have a univocal, transparent and computable linguistic semantics.\n\nFirst IEML has the same expressive power as a natural language. In particular, it allows the construction of complex recursive sentences that may be used for reasoning and complex causal modelling. It is able to explain itself (IEML is its own metalanguage), and it can translate any other natural and specialized language.\n\nAt the same time, its semantics are computable, which means that IEML sequences of phonemes (or chains of characters) self-decode into networks of concepts and that these concepts and their relations can be read in natural languages. It also supports algorithms for the creation and recognition of concepts networks (ontologies, knowledge graphs, domain specific languages, etc.). You don’t create the nodes and the links of semantic networks one by one but through the use of algebraic functions. We’ll see some examples later.\n\nCurrently, I am happy to say that, after more than twenty five years of research and development, the construction of the language is finished and that we have an editor. The langage includes a dictionary of three thousand words (chose « published projects ») and a completely functional and regular grammar. The editor is complete with a parser and all kinds of practical functions to create and explore conceptual networks.\n\nNote that the explanation of IEML sentences and ontologies will come after the following section about the words of the dictionary.\n\nThe Dictionary\n\nThe dictionary of this language contains three thousand words, representing elementary concepts. The number is small to facilitate the calculations on the machine side and the cognitive manageability on the human side. The words are organized into 120 paradigms.\n\nHere are a few examples of the paradigms topics:\n\nclimates & landscapes;\n\ncontinents & regions;\n\noceans & seas;\n\nsky & meteorology;\n\nanimals & plants;\n\ncountries & states;\n\ntechnical functions;\n\nanthropological functions;\n\ntypes of relations;\n\ncalendar time units;\n\nlife cycles;\n\ngenerative mutations;\n\nvalues & ideas;\n\nsigns & semiotic functions;\n\ndata curation & critical thinking;\n\ncomplex feelings;\n\npersonality types;\n\nbody parts, etc.\n\nThe three thousand words can be used as a basis for defining (recursively) all possible and imaginable concepts by means of sentences.\n\nThe general problem in building the dictionary was: how to create the concepts that will be the most useful for the creation of new concepts? In a way it is a bootstrapping problem. You can see here the six basic symbols corresponding to the most elementary concepts.\n\nIt is important to note that these symbols correspond to three types of symmetry, unary for emptiness, binary for virtual/actual and ternary for sign/being/thing. The above figure does not represent a sentence but the symmetry structure of the primitives.\n\nThe Emptiness expresses the absence, the void, the zero, the silence, the noise (as the contrary of information)…\n\nThe virtual denotes the potential, the soul, the abstract, the immaterial or the transcendent dimension of human experience.\n\nThe actual represents the effectiveness, the body, what is concrete, tangible, material or any immanent aspect of reality.\n\nThis echoes all kinds of dualities : heaven and earth, yin and yang, abstract class and individual element, and so on\n\nA sign is an entity or an event that means something for someone. By extension, the semantic primitive « sign » points to symbols, documents, languages, representations, concepts, and anything that is semantically close to code, message or knowledge.\n\nA being is a subject or an interpreter. It can be a human, a group, an animal, a machine or whatever entity or process endowed with self-reference and interpretation. By extension, « being » refers to psychic interiority, the mind, the ability to conceive or interpret, intentions, emotions, people, their relationships, communities, societies and values.\n\nA thing – when it is labelled by a sign, is often called an object or a referent. By extension, « thing » categorizes what we are talking about, objects (abstract or concrete), contextual elements. It also refers to bodies, tools, technology, material equipment, empowerment, power, and efficiency.\n\nSign/being/thing corresponds roughly to the semiotic triangle sign/interpreter/reference but also to all kinds of ternarities like syntax, semantics and pragmatics ; proposition, judgement and state of things ; or legislative, judicial, and executive.\n\nIn fact, these conceptual symmetries correspond to very old traditions, I did not invent them, I have only collected and compacted them. From these six symbols, I have created the 3000 words organized in 120 paradigmatic tables.\n\nA paradigm, or a paradigmatic table, is akin to the map of a semantic field. Every IEML word belongs to one paradigm, and one paradigm only.\n\nA paradigm of words is generated by a morphological function that combines multiplicative and additive operations. The multiplicative operation has 3 roles: substance, attribute, mode, and it is non-commutative and recursive. A two-dimensional table has two variable multiplicative roles.\n\nIn each cell of a table you have two expressions, one in IEML and one in natural language. The expression in natural language is the translation of the IEML word.\n\nIn IEML algebraic expressions, letters represent positions in symmetry systems, and punctuation marks represent recursive multiplication layers.\n\nLet’s come back to the problem of words construction. Playing with the six primitive symbols as if they were building blocks, I created new concepts, and I continued recursively on this path. Again, the problem was to create the most general concepts, in order to allow the creation of new concepts in all possible directions of the semantic space.\n\nHow could I generate general concepts with my six first symbols, concepts able to cover all the directions of the semantic space? I began with the triad sign / being / thing.\n\nOn the left you can see the function that generates this paradigm. You can think of the substance as a figure and the attribute as a background.\n\nNote that when some role is empty, we just put E in this role. In other examples, E would have been in role substance or attribute. We cannot remove E because every role must be filled with a primitive. IEML expressions must be « sequences of primitive symbols », with completely regular syntactic rules. Nevertheless, there are rules allowing the elision of E, provided that the parser can read the syntactic structure thank to the punctuation marks.\n\nOn the first row, we have sign in substance. When signs interact with signs, we get interpretation, reasonning, imagination, thoughts: reflection. When signs interact with beings, express beings, and help beings to communicate, it is language. And when the signs are engraved into things, when they are reified in a way or in another, they become memory.\n\nOn the second row, we have being in substance. When beings gather by the use of common symbols, (rituals, totems, flags, laws, institutions, music, contracts, languages…) they make society. When beings interact with themselves and with other beings, there is pleasure and pain, joy and suffering, and the whole range of emotions. When the objectivity of things is imbued with the symbolic organization, the values and the work of beings, it becomes a livable world.\n\nOn the third row, we have thing in substance with the usual variation sign /being/thing in attribute. When the objectivity of things is registered in a propositional sign, it is the truth. When the materiality of things comes to support the being, it is the life. Finally, the interaction of things, their respective positions, their envelopments, their connections form the space.\n\nThese nine very elementary concepts represent different points of departure, all equally valid, for the description of human experience. By using the same kind of reasoning, I created eighteen other lower-case letters.\n\nAs long sequences of the 6 Upper Case primitive symbols would have been difficult to read and write for humans, some often used sequences of three upper case letters are simplified into twenty-five lower case letters. There are ten vowels and fifteen consonnants to help human reading and understanding.\n\nYou can see, on the left of the slide, the function that generates the twenty-five lower case letters. The four colors on the table represent four symmetry systems inherent to the lower case letters. We have already studied the blue section.\n\nI will just comment on the yellow section, with the letters y o e u a i. The first row displays three virtual actions: know (related to sign), want (related to being) and can (related to thing). The second row shows three actual actions : to say or communicate (related to signs), to commit (related to being) and to do (related to thing). For comments on the other sections and more details on the 25 lowercase letters, see https://intlekt.io/25-basic-categories/\n\nNow let’s look at two more examples of paradigms, at higher layers. In the human development paradigm the words combine two letters. The generative function is: (s+b+t+k+m+nd+f+l) × (y+o+e+u+a+i) × (E)\n\nThe nine rows correspond to our nine concepts s b t k m n d f l and these concepts are declined (like in « declension ») according to the six types of action that we have seen before in the yellow section.\n\nThe six columns corresponds to types of knowledge, types of will or orientations, types of skills, types of signs, types of social roles, and types of tools or technologies. Now let’s have a look at the fifth column (social roles).\n\nThe reorganization of a column or row into a new table is automatic in the IEML editor. We find here our nine consonnants in position of substance and the letter a, corresponding to the notion of commitment, is in position of attribute. The generative function is (s+b+t+k+m+nd+f+l) × a × E. This gives us nine basic social roles. The interpreter corresponds to “reflection”, the storyteller to “language”, the scribe to “memory”, the chief to “society”, the parent to “emotion”, the judge to “world”, the researcher to “truth”, the healer to “life” and the guardian to “space”. Of course there are many more social roles in the dictionnary. Another paradigm multiplies these nine by themselves resulting in eighty-one other social roles.\n\nA paradigm of scientific disciplines and sub-disciplines, contains also the objects of study and the name of the specialists. It amounts to three hundred and ninety two words. The table below is just a little part of this paradigm.\n\nIn this table, corresponding to the function:\n\n(s.y.- + b.y.- + t.y.-) × (y.- + o.- + e.- + u.- + a.- + i.-) × ( s.y.-)\n\nyou can see that the rows correspond respectively to philosophy, communication and history. The columns correspond respectively to « science », « politics », « economy », « communication », « sociology » and « technology ». Of course, the common themes have parallels in functional invariants. For example, everything related to history begins by “t.”\n\nIn short, every word is part of a paradigm and every paradigm is organized along very regular semantic symmetries that are reflected into syntactic symmetries.\n\nSentences and Hypertexts\n\nNow, we are going to see how to make sentences and semantic networks in IEML.\n\nOn the slide above you have the translation in IEML of the English sentence: » In a house, a mother tells a story from a book, to her child, with love, among joyful laughter, before she falls asleep. » The IEML words are represented by their counterpart in English and it is the structure of the IEML sentence that is underlined here.\n\nLike words, sentences are generated in paradigms by generative functions. And we are going to see an example of a sentence paradigm later. As for the morphological function, the syntagmatic function combines multiplicative and additive operations. But it is not exactly the same operations as in the morphological function.\n\nThe additive operations correspond to junctions (like: and, or, but, because, and so on…)\n\nThe multiplicative operation has nine roles: the root corresponds to the verb (or to the main noun when it is a noun phrase), the initiator corresponds to the subject of traditional grammar, the interactant corresponds to the object of traditional grammar, there is also a recipient role and five complement roles : causality, time, place, intention and manner.\n\nIn an IEML sentence, the grammar distinguishes four kinds of parts:\n\nThe concepts are identified by a hash sign. They can be words or nested sentences.\n\nThe inflections, are identified by a tilde. They precise the meaning of concepts. For exemple, at the root role, the verb « tell » is precised by an indicative mood and a present tense and the nouns in other roles are precised by a gender, a number, or an article.\n\nThe prepositions identified by a star, determine the particular cases of the complements. For exemple, in this sentence, the time role is precised by the preposition « before » and the place role by the preposition « in ».\n\nFinally, the junctions are identified by an ampersand. You can see an example of « and » here at the manner role, on the last line of the sentence.\n\nTo give you an idea of the fine nuance you can achieve in IEML, there are eighty inflections, one hundred and thirty one prepositions and twenty nine junctions.\n\nIEML can explicitly handle proper nouns and references that are not general categories. Everything that is inside angled brackets is not a general category but a reference. This is the way to handle proper nouns, numbers and data in general. Of course, it is possible to have IEML expressions in reference and therefore the language is self-referential and can be its own metalanguage.\n\nLink sentences are used to explain and connect words and sentences. As you can see on the slide above, semantic links are just sentences with arguments. You can have links with one, two, three, or four arguments that will connect respectively one, two, three or four conceptual nodes (words or sentences). The link represented on the slide says that «A is the contrary of B».\n\nOf course a link like « A is the contrary of B » can be used in a wide variety of cases. The actualization of the link is performed by a function which determines the domain of the arguments and the syntactic conditions for the creation of the link. In this case, the function will create links like « to the right » is the contrary of « to the left ».\n\nTwo remarks here:\n\nFirst, the semantic relations are created by a syntactic function.\n\nSecond, because of the regular and symmetric structure of the paradigms, a function actualizes several links. So you don’t have to create the links one by one.\n\nLike words, sentences can be organized in paradigms. The example depicted on the slide below comes from an ontology of mental health in IEML.\n\nYou have one constant role « symptoms related to perception » and two variable roles corresponding to the perception problems and to the senses that are affected. As you can see, the variables are between braces. And below you see the resulting table:\n\nNow let’s recap! IEML has the same power as a natural language. It can handle…\n\nnarration and causal modelling,\n\ndialogue, reasoning and translation,\n\nindexation, reference and self-explanation.\n\nIt has the same power as a natural language *and* at the same time, it is also a mathematical category. This means that is organizes a morphism or a systematic correspondance between an algebra and a graph structure\n\nThe algebra is about the linearity of texts: all IEML expressions are punctuated sequences of the six primitives. We have probably a non-commutative ring (the demonstration have been made for the layer of words – see here chapter 5 – it is still a conjecture for the layer of sentences).\n\nThe graph structure is about the concept network. At the grammatical level you have syntactic trees of nested sentences which cross paradigmatic matrixes. This makes a rather interesting graph, a kind of rhizome. And on top of that, link sentences combined with syntactic conditions produce more semantic relations between concepts.\n\nOf course mathematization does not mean necessarily quantification. It can be a formalization of qualitative structures. In particular, abstract algebra can handle all kinds of symmetry systems and not only in the realm of numbers and geometrical figures.\n\nThe secret of the computability of IEML semantics lies in its coding principle. Semantic symmetries (the signified) are coded by syntactic symmetries (the signifier). And paradigmatic matrixes are created by functions with constants and variables.\n\nIf I were not held back by my modesty, I would say that Chomsky mathematized the syntagmatic trees and that – thanks to the coding system I have just explained – I have added the mathematization of paradigmatic matrices.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhich new perspectives would IEML bring if it was adopted as a Semantic Protocol?\n\nFirst, general semantic interoperability. Semantic interoperability means that – coded in IEML – the meaning will be computable and easily sharable. Semantic interoperability is not about formats (like RDF, for example) but about architectures of concepts, ontologies and data models that would be connected across different domains, because nodes and links can be brought back automatically to the same dictionary according to the same grammar. Semantic interoperability means essentially an augmented collective intelligence.\n\nFor neuronal AI, if the tokens taken into account by the models were variables of a semantic algebra instead of phonetic chains of characters in natural languages, the machine learning would be more effective, and the results would be more transparent and explainable. My intention is to pursue the research direction of « semantic Machine learning ». Labelling / annotating data with good ontologies helps *generalization* in machine learning!\n\nFor symbolic IA, we would have concepts and their relations generated by semantic functions. Even more importanly, the mode of definition of concepts would change radically. Instead of having concepts that are defined separately from each other by means of unique identifiers (the URIs) on the model of referential semantics, we would have concepts defined by other concepts of the same language, like in a dictionary.\n\nWe know that there are problems of accumulation, sharing and recombination of knowledge between AI systems / models. A semantic protocol based on IEML will lead to logical de-compartmentalization, neuro-symbolic integration, accumulation and fluid recombination of knowledge.\n\nThe blockchain domain is important because it means the automation of value allocation. Today, smart contracts are written in many different programming languages bringing problems of interoperability between machines and readability for non-programming humans. With a semantic protocol based on IEML, smart co"
