        "text": "When we study human language, we are approaching what some might call the \"human essence,\" the distinctive qualities of mind that are, so far as we know, unique to man.\n\nNoam Chomsky, Language and Mind\n\nSo the obvious hypothesis is that our language is the result of the unfolding of a genetically determined program.\n\nNoam Chomsky, Interview to KBS TV, Kyoto, Japan\n\nLanguage serves essentially for the expression of thought.\n\nNoam Chomsky, Language and Responsibility\n\nIn my opinion one should not speak of a \"relationship\" between linguistics and psychology, because linguistics is part of psychology.\n\nNoam Chomsky, Language and Responsibility\n\nThe child, placed in a linguistic community, is presented with a set of sentences that is limited and often imperfect, fragmented, and so on. In spite of this, in a very short time he succeeds in \"constructing,\" in internalizing the grammar of his language, developing knowledge that is very complex, ...\n\nNoam Chomsky, Language and Responsibility\n\nCHOMSKY, Noam. American linguist and political writer born on Dec. 7, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nAvram Noam Chomsky was introduced to linguistics by his father, a Hebrew scholar who worked with historical linguistics. Noam studied at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a doctoral degree in linguistics in 1955, and then he began teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where today he is Institute Professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\n\nTo find the principles common to all languages that enable people to speak creatively and freely is Noam Chomsky's description of his goal as a linguist. Many recent works have stressed that all children go through the same stages of language development regardless of the language they are learning. In examining this, Chomsky gave linguistics, the study of the human speech, a new direction.\n\nKnowing a language means being able to produce an infinite number of sentences never spoken before and to understand sentences never heard before. Chomsky refers to this ability as the \"creative aspect\" of language.\n\nHis first book, Syntactic Structures, published in 1957, outlines his system of transformational grammar. This grammar consists of surface structures - the sounds and words in a sentence - and deep structures that contain the meaning of the sentence. The meaning is converted by a transformation - any of an ordered set of rules - to a surface structure. Chomsky says that children are born with a knowledge of the principles of the grammatical structure of all languages, and this inborn knowledge explains the success and speed with which they learn language.\n\nFurther, his work implies and he states that linguistics is a branch of psychology, and that an understanding of the rules of a language throws light on the principles that regulate human thought. Other of his linguistic publications include:\n\nAspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965)\n\nCartesian Linguistics (1966)\n\nThe Sound Pattern of English (with Morris Halle, 1968)\n\nLanguage and Mind (1968, 1972)\n\nThe Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1975)\n\nReflections on Language (1975)\n\nLectures on Government and Binding (1981)\n\nModular Approach to the Study of the Mind (1983)\n\nBarriers (1986)\n\nNoam Chomsky has been much more than just a brilliant and revolutionary linguist. Chomsky's studies on political and social issues are strong with intelligent criticism. A long-time political activist, Chomsky is the author of numerous books and articles on US foreign policy, international affairs, human rights, modern history, American political life, and peace movements.\n\nThis is the other side of Mr. Chomsky's, which very understandably, the American mainstream media tries to obscure. His social, political, and economic works include:\n\nAmerican Power and the New Mandarins (1967)\n\nPeace in the Middle East (1974)\n\nThe Political Economy of Human Rights (two volumes, 1979)\n\nLanguage and Responsibility (1979)\n\nThe Fateful Triangle (1983)\n\nThe Culture of Terrorism (1988)\n\nMobilizing Democracy: Changing the U.S. Role in the Middle East (1991)\n\nRogue States (2000)\n\nSee also"
