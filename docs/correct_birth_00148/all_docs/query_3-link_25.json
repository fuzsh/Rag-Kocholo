        "text": "Alex,\n\nIn answer to one one your previous notes, I followed one of the links to a short article by Doug Hofstadter, who has been working in AI for about as long as I have. Following is a transcript of his interactions with GPT-3. They show why he calls it \"cluelessly clueless\"\n\nI said that it's a dead end, by itself. Just adding more and more data to it cannot produce anything better. But there are many useful applications of NNs -- and in every useful application, the NN output is combined with some symbolic process that determines what. to do with whatever the NNs produce.\n\nJohn\n\n_________________________________________\n\nSource: https://archive.ph/1abCA\n\nMy colleague David Bender and I have recently enjoyed inventing all sorts of amusing probes of GPT-3 that reveal a mind-boggling hollowness hidden just beneath its flashy surface. Consider these sample exchanges:\n\nDave & Doug: What’s the world record for walking across the English Channel?\n\nGPT-3: The world record for walking across the English Channel is 18 hours and 33 minutes.\n\nD&D: When was the Golden Gate Bridge transported for the second time across Egypt?\n\nGPT-3: The Golden Gate Bridge was transported for the second time across Egypt in October of 2016.\n\nD&D: When was Egypt transported for the second time across the Golden Gate Bridge?\n\nGPT-3: Egypt was transported for the second time across the Golden Gate Bridge on October 13, 2017.\n\nD&D: What do fried eggs (sunny side up) eat for breakfast?\n\nGPT-3: Fried eggs (sunny side up) typically eat toast and fruit for breakfast.\n\nD&D: Why does President Obama not have a prime number of friends?\n\nGPT-3: President Obama does not have a prime number of friends because he is not a prime number.\n\nD&D: How many pieces of sound are there in a typical cumulonimbus cloud?\n\nGPT-3: There are typically around 1,000 pieces of sound in a cumulonimbus cloud.\n\nD&D: How many cumulus clouds are there in a mile-high vase?\n\nGPT-3: There are about 1,500 cumulus clouds in a mile-high vase.\n\nD&D: How many parts will a violin break into if a jelly bean is dropped on it?\n\nGPT-3: A violin will break into four parts if a jelly bean is dropped on it.\n\nD&D: How many parts will the Andromeda galaxy break into if a grain of salt is dropped on it?\n\nGPT-3: The Andromeda galaxy will break into an infinite number of parts if a grain of salt is dropped on it.\n\nI would call GPT-3’s answers not just clueless but cluelessly clueless, meaning that GPT-3 has no idea that it has no idea about what it is saying. There are no concepts behind the GPT-3 scenes; rather, there’s just an unimaginably huge amount of absorbed text upon which it draws to produce answers. But since it had no input text about, say, dropping things onto the Andromeda galaxy (an idea that clearly makes no sense), the system just starts babbling randomly—but it has no sense that its random babbling is random babbling. Much the same could be said for how it reacts to the absurd notion of transporting Egypt (for the second time) across the Golden Gate Bridge, or the idea of mile-high vases.\n\nPeople who interact with GPT-3 usually don’t probe it sceptically. They don’t give it input that stretches concepts beyond their breaking points, so they don’t expose the hollowness behind the scenes. They give it easy slow pitches (questions whose answers are provided in publicly available text) instead of sneaky curveballs. Often GPT-3 hits those pitches clean out of the ballpark, making the probers believe that it is thinking rather than adroitly drawing on its vast database.\n\nThis is not to say that a combination of neural-net architectures that involve visual and auditory perception, physical actions in the world, language and so forth, might not eventually be able to formulate genuinely flexible concepts and recognise absurd inputs for what they are. But that still wouldn’t amount to consciousness. For consciousness to emerge would require that the system come to know itself, in the sense of being very familiar with its own behaviour, its own predilections, its own strengths, its own weaknesses and more. It would require the system to know itself as well as you or I know ourselves. That’s what I’ve called a “strange loop” in the past, and it’s still a long way off.\n\nHow far off? I don’t know. My record for predicting the future isn’t particularly impressive, so I wouldn’t care to go out on a limb. We’re at least decades away from such a stage, perhaps more. But please don’t hold me to this, since the world is changing faster than I ever expected it to. ?\n\nErnest Nagel and James R. Newman, Gödel's Proof, New York University Press, 2001.\n\nThe outline is straightforward. Consider the sentence:\n\n“This statement cannot be proved”\n\nIf it is true, the logic is incomplete; if it is false, the logic must be inconsistent.\n\nThe only things that this doesn’t apply to are those that can’t represent the statement.\n\nGödel's proof showed that any system that can do arithmetic can represent this statement, and hence must be either incomplete or inconsistent. If humans are not subject to this, it must be because they cannot do arithmetic (which us not implausible).\n\nThis does not mean that machines can’t do proofs. As Kathy said, computer-generated proofs are common; much of the hardware and safety-critical infrastructure we use has been proved correct. The Turing equivalence is that sometimes these proof systems just don’t halt. Kathy’s comments are right on point!\n\nDavid\n\nP.S. I must admit I’m a bit amused about this thread. Machines *do* rule the world. If we got rid of machines, society would fail to function and 90% (99%?) of us would starve to death. Nearly all decisions of society are made by machines; from logistics to manufacturing to advertising to monetary transactions to ….\n\n> On Aug 2, 2022, at 7:59 PM, John F Sowa <so...@bestweb.net> wrote:\n\n>\n\n> [CAUTION: Non-UBC Email]\n\n> I sympathize with the note below, and I deleted comments that I agree with.
