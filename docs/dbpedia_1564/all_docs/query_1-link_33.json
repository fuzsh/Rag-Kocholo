        "text": "Bauhaus alumni For students who attended the Bauhaus. i.e. the Staatliches Bauhaus, in Weimar, Dessau or Berlin, between 1919 and 1933. For Bauhaus teachers, workshop masters, etc., use the category Bauhaus teachers. Some Bauhaus students later became teachers at the school, so these should be indexed by both terms.\n\nGerman Wikipedia currently has many more articles on former Bauhaus students than English Wikipedia. Click on Deutsch under the Languages link on the menu to see a more comprehensive list of names. You are encouraged to create English articles or stubs for any former students for whom there is no English article."
