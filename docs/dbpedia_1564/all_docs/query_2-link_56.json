        "text": "Judit Karasz (1912 – 1977) & Irena Blühová (Iren Blüh) (1904-1991)\n\nHungarian photographer Judit was a student between 1930 – 32 and Slovakian photographer Irena was a student between 1931 – 32\n\nHungarian photographer Judit Kárász was one of the few Bauhaus students to explore social photography. Before the war, she documented poverty and social exclusion in Hungary and Denmark, often with her fellow Bauhaus student Slovak activist photographer Irena Blühová (Iren Blüh) (1904-1991) through their organisation Sociofoto.\n\nAfter the war, Judit worked as a photographer at the Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest for almost 20 years while Irena continued her socialist activism and photography into the 1990s. She received the Josef Sudek Medal commemorating her photography in 1989.\n\nMarta Hoepffner (1912–2000)\n\nGerman photographer studied painting and graphic design at the Bauhaus before turning to photography.\n\nMarta Hoepffner made several photograms at this time, often dedicated to famous composers or musical scores. Although many of her experimental photographs of the 1930s were lost in World War II, she opened a photographic school in 1949 and in the 1960s, played a role in the light and kinetic art movement."
