        "text": "German architect Walter Gropius founds the Staatliches (State) Bauhaus in Weimar. Established as an egalitarian utopia during the brief liberal upswell in Germany after World War I, the school seeks to revive nineteenth-century ideas about craft and fine art using twentieth-century tools of mass production. More than 160 students enroll the first semester.\n\nGropius recruits American Lyonel Feininger, German Gerhard Marcks, and Swiss Johannes Itten to become the first Bauhaus masters (professors).\n\nDe Stijl cofounder Theo van Doesburg moves to Weimar. While he did not teach at the Bauhaus, he did much to introduce objectivity, industrial production, and the use of a limited visual palette to the lexicon of local artists and students.\n\nDesigner and artist El Lissitzky arrives in Germany. He introduces Russian constructivism to future Bauhaus instructor László Moholy-Nagy, which would become a key ingredient in the Bauhaus’s aesthetic and philosophy.\n\nAustrian artist and Bauhaus student Friedl Dicker typesets a section of an essay by Itten in Utopia. It is a feat in experimental letterpress, showcasing cantilevered, undulating, and otherwise expressively set text.\n\nAdolf Hitler becomes chairman of the National Socialist Party, a far-right political party with racist and xenophobic views. As a result of post–World War I reparations, the value of German currency begins to plummet, creating an economic crisis that sets the stage for Hitler’s rise.\n\nFamed Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky joins the faculty. His quest to forge color, form, sound, and motion into a spiritual ideal influences the Bauhaus’s early mysticism.\n\nBauhaus master Itten resigns, in no small part due to his own belief in Mazdaznan, an ascetic religion associated with eugenics and white supremacy. With his departure, the school’s focus shifts from the metaphysical and expressionistic to the utilitarian and mechanically replicable.\n\nThe Bauhaus puts on an exhibition to justify its funding to the local government, producing an accompanying catalog. It also includes a week’s worth of lectures and performances, such as Schlemmer’s Triadic Ballet, in which he adapts Bauhaus design principles to the body with elemental costumes and geometric choreography. The exhibition and its programming are a publicity success but a political failure.\n\nThe conservative government in Weimar cuts the Bauhaus’s funding. Gropius moves the school to the more liberal city of Dessau.\n\nGropius and Moholy-Nagy publish the first eight Bauhaus Books to share the pedagogies of the school’s masters and peers. They ultimately produce fourteen titles in the series. It is one of the first serious efforts to document the thinkers of the modernist movement, as well as an early example of branded series publishing, with every book in a consistent trim, format, and design.\n\nFormer Bauhaus student Herbert Bayer joins the faculty, leading the newly formed print and advertising workshop, the school’s first official program in design. He begins setting the school’s print materials solely in lowercase letters. This eschewal of more traditional German orthography—in which all nouns are capitalized—becomes a hallmark of Bauhaus typography.\n\nGropius unveils the school’s new building in Dessau with a revolutionary glass façade and iconic signage by Herbert Bayer.\n\nThe institution also begins publishing bauhaus, a quarterly magazine that reports on the school’s functions and contributions to larger conversations in art and architecture, as well as student life. It is published fairly consistently until 1933.\n\nMeyer takes over the directorship from Gropius, who leaves to focus on architecture. A strict functionalist, Meyer realigns the school to meet social needs through architecture and industry. In the wake of these tumultuous shifts to the curriculum, Moholy-Nagy and Bayer leave the Bauhaus.\n\nWorld War I veteran and former student Joost Schmidt becomes head of the print and advertising workshop.\n\nThe Bauhaus was famous for its costume parties, where students and masters mingled. The most spectacular example is the 1929 Metallic Festival. Attendees wore outfits made of metal and danced under an installation of reflective orbs.\n\nThe school pairs up with an industrial partner to manufacture a line of wallpaper. One of many products sold by the Bauhaus, the wallpaper proves wildly successful and helps fund the school as government support wanes. It is still in production today.\n\nA record 201 students enroll in the Bauhaus’s winter session.\n\nAccused of turning the school into a communist haven, Meyer, the second director, is fired and goes to Moscow. Leading German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe takes his place. He has little choice but to make the school more traditional to appease Dessau’s rising National Socialist Party.\n\nIn January, Hitler becomes chancellor of Germany. In April, the Gestapo raids the Bauhaus Berlin under claims that it promotes “degenerate art” and “cosmopolitan modernism,” a thinly veiled anti-Semitic claim. Third director Mies van der Rohe and the Bauhaus faculty vote not to reopen the school.\n\nMany Bauhauslers begin struggling to work in Germany due to their foreigner status, progressive politics, or association with the institution. The exodus out of Germany and then Europe at large begins: Moholy-Nagy moves to the Netherlands, and Albers relocates to the United States to lead Black Mountain College, where Feininger later teaches as well. Many Jewish teachers and students also flee Nazi persecution, establishing Bauhaus outposts as far afield as Tel Aviv.\n\nSome are not able to leave, including Joost Schmidt, who is eventually blacklisted from working as a designer in Germany and dies in 1948, and Friedl Dicker, who is murdered at Auschwitz in 1944.\n\nAt Gropius’s urging, Bayer is hired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York to organize the first U.S. Bauhaus exhibition, which allows him to leave Germany just before the outbreak of World War II. He has a long career in advertising in America and dies in California in 1985.\n\nFormer Bauhaus directors Gropius and Mies van der Rohe pass away in the United States fifty years after the founding of the school and more than thirty after the Nazis forced its closure. A flurry of semicentennial events (such as MIT’s exhibition and accompanying publication, to name just one) further solidify the school’s legacy in the museum world and in print."
