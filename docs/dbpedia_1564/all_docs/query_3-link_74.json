        "text": "The information of this paper was delivered at the Conference of the International Federation for Research in Women’s History [In Association with the Bulgarian Women’s History Group, the Bulgarian Association of University Women and Sofia University “St. Kliment Ohridski”], Women, Gender and the Cultural Production of Knowledge, St. Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia, 8-11 August 2007 Investigations on women architects from the 1980s until the present have pointed out worldwide pioneering figures, however, the analyses on their work are scarce. For the entire period between the two world wars, the number of architectural, urban and interior designs that Bulgarian women architects have worked on is over 200. Still, their names are rarely mentioned in publications on 20th century history of architecture and rather small part of their professional experience is familiar to the public. Numerous works and several sensational facts concerning the 20th century history of architecture in Bulgaria were discovered by a research project on the topic. This research underlines the necessity to popularize the pioneer women architects’ creativity in Bulgaria and worldwide through publications and exhibitions, and to introduce information about them into the architectural curriculum of universities. This will change the views on the 20th century development of architectural profession as well as of the Modern Movement culture in Bulgaria."
