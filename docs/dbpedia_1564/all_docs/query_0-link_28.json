        "text": "The main title of Hanneke Oosterhof’s dissertation, ‘Because the ground belongs to us all,’ refers to a saying that was commonly used by Lotte Stam-Beese in articles and during lectures. Oosterhof: “To her mind, it was a problem in many new, post-war neighborhoods that people didn’t feel connected to the ground, to their direct, physical living environment. She believed that everyone should be aware of that environment and feel responsible for it.”\n\nStam-Beese attended the Bauhaus school in Dessau and later became the first woman to get accepted in the new architecture course neue Baulehre, established by Hannes Meyer. In the nineteen-thirties, she worked as an architect in Berlin, Brno (Czechoslovakia) and in the Soviet Union, where she helped to construct the socialist cities known as Sotsgorods.\n\nIn 1934 she moved to the Netherlands, after she fell in love with Dutch architect and designer Mart Stam, who also lived and worked in the Soviet Union. In the Netherlands, she worked as a photographer, graphic designer, product designer, illustrator, writer of articles, but most of all as an urban planning-architect for the city of Rotterdam between 1948 and 1971."
