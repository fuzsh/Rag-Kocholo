        "text": "Their art — and their love story — spanned decades and continents.\n\nNow, the works of the \"Bauhaus powerhouse couple\", Anni and Josef Albers, are set to go on display at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA).\n\nThe NGA holds the largest collection of the Albers' works in Australia, but this is the first time they have been honoured with an exhibition of their own.\n\nAnd it's about time, according to curator Imogen Dixon-Smith.\n\n\"They were incredibly influential to artists working later in the century, as well as even working now.\"\n\nA love story which began at the acclaimed Bauhaus\n\nAnni and Josef's story began in 1922, when they met at the acclaimed Bauhuas, an experimental school of art and design in Germany.\n\nJosef had been much poorer than many of his contemporaries and had to scrounge around to source glass to use in his works.\n\nBut according to Ms Dixon-Smith, it was Josef who helped Anni, a wealthy Berliner, with her studies so she could get in, as she hadn't been initially successful.\n\nJust three years later, they were married, and both artists remained at the school until it was forced to close in 1933 under increasing pressure from the fascist government.\n\nAnni, as a woman at the school, was placed in the textiles workshop.\n\nWhile she wasn't initially happy with this placement, as she believed it to be too \"sissy\", Ms Dixon-Smith said she became highly influential in the discipline.\n\n\"[She] paved a way for textiles to be considered art, alongside paintings and other mediums,\" she said.\n\nDuring his time at the Bauhaus, Josef was a glass artist, but he later turned his attention to painting.\n\nTaking Modernism to the United States\n\nWhen they were forced to flee Germany for the United States, both Josef and Anni took the modernist teachings of the Bauhaus with them.\n\nThe opportunity to go to the United States and work at an \"experimental\" school called Black Mountain College in North Carolina was one Anni and Josef could not turn down.\n\nBoth taught at the school while continuing to create art across the disciplines of weaving, painting and print-making.\n\nAnni was also a textiles educator, and wrote a number of \"seminal texts\" in the space.\n\nHer work and influence meant that by 1949, she had become the first textile artist to be given a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nAnd while it was decades before her husband would be given the same privilege, his work as an experimental artist, teacher and colour theorist was also influential.\n\nIn 1969, he published a theory of colour which posited that colour is relative, and dependent on the context in which it's seen.\n\nThat theory culminated in his most famous series of work, Homage to the Square, a kind of \"obsessive playing\" with the interaction of the motif of the square and different colours.\n\n\"And through this ... process of working out what colours go, what colours make us feel a certain way when combined together.\n\nMany other artists have continued to be influenced by those colour theories, Ms Dixon-Smith explained.\n\nExhibition brings together works with those of their contemporaries\n\nA selection of the couple's most acclaimed works, including Josef's Homage to the Square: On an Early Sky, Gray Instrumentation and White line square and Anni's Meander and Mountainous series are included in the exhibition at the NGA.\n\nWorks from their contemporaries, including Ludwig Hirschfeld-Mack, Paul Klee, Gunta Stölzl and Lotte Stam-Beese are also on display.\n\nIt was Hirschfield-Mack, in particular, who had been instrumental in bringing the Bauhaus legacy to Australia.\n\nAlso an artist at the Bauhaus, he was eventually deported to Australia from London and after being interned for a number of years, became an educator here.\n\nThe exhibition will open this Saturday, June 8, and will be open until September at the NGA."
