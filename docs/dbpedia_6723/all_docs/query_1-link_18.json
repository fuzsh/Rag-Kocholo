        "text": "We currently use an NSA240 for our primary location with the CGSS package. Apparently the NSA240 just went EOL last month so they are only offering 1-year renewals which come out to about the same price over three years as upgrading to a NSA220 that includes 3 years of CGSS using the Secure Upgrade Plus program .\n\nI contacted Sonicwall Sales and asked what happens with the NSA240. Obviously you won’t be able to add services to it or get a support contract, but does it still function as a basic router/firewall device? The only answer they gave me was “It will just work as a router”. IT was not said with much confidence either. That does not tell me a whole lot. Can you still connect a site-to-site VPN? Can you still set up firewall rules? Does NAT still work? Can you still control SonicPoints with it?\n\nHas anyone traded up using this program? What kind of functionality is still available on the old unit after transferring the license?\n\nThanks\n\nKevin\n\nFrom what I read, and we just did this, you can use it period. If they detect that serial you could lose all the licenses you just acquired. I just physically destroyed my unit and turned it into recycling.\n\nEdit: Right from the Terms and Conditions:\n\n“if the Eligible Competitive Product is not disposed of within sixty (60) days of Registration Date of the Replacement Product SonicWALL reserves the right to terminate the services applicable to the Replacement Product SKU.”\n\nI saw that in the Terms, but that mentions the “Competitive Product”, which by their definition:\n\nEligible Competitive Product means the competitive manufacturer’s product that the Owner has agreed to replace and remove from service and is listed in the Eligible Product Matrix below.\n\nAlso, I would imaging that the sales rep would have mentioned that it must be disposed of if that were the case.\n\nHere is probably the official answer http://www.sonicwall.com/downloads/DS_Secure_Upgrade_Plus_US_Final\n\n“If proof of ownership of the Eligible Competitive Product is not available within fifteen (15) days upon written request from SonicWALL or if the Eligible Competitive Product is not disposed of within sixty (60) days of Registration Date of the Replacement Product SonicWALL reserves the right to terminate the services applicable to the Replacement Product SKU…”\n\nIt would void the new product you upgraded to, services.If I am reading this right.\n\nDepending on your need of more than one firewall and how much of a discount you would get for the upgrade package there are a few things to consider.\n\nI have used many Sonicwall products after EOL and have been at many companies who did not have support. You get a basic firewall and VPNs. No IDS, Content Filtering, Anti Spyware etc. Viewpoint still works though.\n\nHowever, this may not be the best situation if you run into a situation when you need phone support. They will not help with things not under coverage. One of the benefits I used to rely on was next day replacement of defective boxes. And with Sonicwall the flashing wrech happens frequently. It speeds up replacement time.\n\nYou guys are fast. I see we all went to the same source.\n\nI switched from a Pro2040 to a NSA2400 two years ago (or so) and still have the Pro here.\n\nI spoke to them at one point and was told that the old one could be used, indefinitely but none of the additional components would work nor could it be licensed again, so basically as-is.\n\nI don’t think that quote is right, it’s not a “competitive” upgrade it’s their own product."
