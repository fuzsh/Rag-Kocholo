Easy to configure and administrate. Cones loaded with content filtering and application filtering. Its just good to know that while the appliance comes with these extras they are not best of bread products.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nIn addition to a few NSA2400’s I was also lucky enough to have the priviledge to play with a handful of these devices. I may just be lucky, but there was not a single problem I had with the devices over the years that I worked with them. Much like the 2400s these were very painless; easy to configure rules, routing, HA pairs, and site to site VPNs. I never did have a look at the CLI interface, as the web interface was straightforward, and in my opinion, elegant. I will take a very hard look at what has transpired with the brand since being acquired by Dell, but I believe this will be my leading contender for the next round of network security devices.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI just replace my old and well behave Sonicwall TZ170 for this new unit NSA 240, probably force for warranty and security. The new OS is definetively an improuvement and the wizard is ok, but trying to do something else on the unit is really complicated and probably a training is required. So for intermidiate users not really friendly you either and expert or a novice and just go around with the wizard.\n\nNot 100% happy.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nWe purchased this product last month. I upgraded from a Cisco PIX 515e. This device works rather well for my 50-60 users. It is a UTM with firewall, content filter, gateway anti-virus, optional client anti-virus, spam filter, malware/spyware filter and such. It was a breeze to setup, thought some of the settings are stumbling blocks for Cisco users (terminology is different).\n\nOverall I like this it was exactly what I was looking for and performs well in my environment. Feel free to ask me questions.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThis has been a very good firewall/router for our needs. Once I quit trying to manually configure the device and started using the built-in wizards, setup was a breeze. The setup wizards did all of the heavy lifting, allowing me to tweak small “here and there’s” after the fact. The anti-spam, anti-spyware, and IDS have been easy to setup and work with. I did notice that web browsing does seem a bit slower after enabling all of the extra security features (AV, AS, IDS, and Content Filtering). VPN configuration and setup has also been turn-key in nature as well. All in all, I’ve been very happy with the device and believe that it compares nicely against my past experiences with a Juniper SSG-20.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nWe replaced our little old WRT54G with a new NSA 240 and it has been a great investment! With the Comprehensive Gateway Security options (which is a little pricey) but for what it does and how much it has improved our network it was well spent. The only issue that it has given us is its built-in L2TP Vpn server which I have not been able to get functioning. However, it could just be something on my part that is keeping it from working.\n\nOveral Great product!\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nWe have two of these units setup in a fail-over configuration, fortunately they have never had to fail-over ! They are great and the VPN is super easy to configure, the VPN client is awesome, traffic rules and firewall rules are just as easy. The throughput on VPN is great, its fast enough to stream video from our VMS to a remote client without any problems.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nFirst experience with this unit was at my internship, it was a great device to learn from and to help moderate. Definitely recommended for small business looking to secure and manage their network. Upgrade to the NSA2400 was straightforward and did not present any major issues.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars"
