        "text": "I am revamping a WAN setup I inherited which is a few years out of date. At this point there are 7 Sonicwall NSA 2400s connected by site to site VPNs, a couple of VLANs and no VOIP. Very simple connections, only basic switching and port filtering/NAT going on. Each 2400 has 2-3 Internet connections coming into it on a failover configuration. Networking is not my strong point, and frankly I find the entire setup confusing to audit, change or manage.\n\nI am looking to replace this scenario with 11 firewall devices, connected via site to site VPNs, 3 VLANs per site (network, VOIP, guest), supporting VOIP. 20-300 users behind each device. My primary criteria will be:\n\nSite to site VPNs work well with existing Sonicwall NSA 2400 devices. I need an easy, gradual replacement of equipment.\n\nLow cost. Hopefully sub $1000 range if that’s reasonable.\n\nSolid performance. No more mysterious dropped Internet connections or having to reboot regularly to ensure device is working.\n\nEASY to configure\n\nEASY to monitor. I need something with good dashboarding/reporting so I can understand what’s causing issues on the network without having to dig through MBs of log files. Centralized control would be nice, but I’m fine going device to device if it’s a better fit.\n\nSomething with good load balancing would be nice. My failover configurations work, but require too much manual intervention.\n\nI welcome vendor contacts, but if so please propose a device and model with information I can review. I just don’t have time to line up a dozen webinars or phone conversations.\n\nWould greatly prefer community feedback on what’s worked for you.\n\nWe went from Cisco <> Cisco devices to Cisco Meraki <> Cisco Meraki routers. We mixed up some MXs at larger branches and Z1s for smaller (3 or 4 employees only) branches.\n\nMakes everything easy to manage, monitor and make changes. VPN works like a charm between sites and also for remote access for users also. We also ended up with the ‘free 100’ MDM licenses as well, so that we can monitor employee devices too.\n\nWe got some info about HPE/Aruba devices, but Meraki so far has been easiest to deploy and configure. The basic MXs support at least dual ISP connections and also have the ability to have cellular backup as well. The Z1’s have single ISP connection, but have cellular backup as well.\n\nWell worth it!\n\n@Cisco @Cisco_Meraki_1\n\nBased on your description, you are more looking into VPN router(s), than firewalls.\n\nFirewalls today offer far more than VPN connectivity and some port forwarding. When you look for a replacement in the $1000 range, you will really end up with routers and not with anything, you could call a modern firewall.\n\nPossibly you don’t have the time, but however it’s hard, you will have to find some time to let someone explain you, why you would not want just a router, but a proper modern firewall. Once you understand the difference, it will still be your decision, what you want to go with.\n\nI sell and support WatchGuard firewalls and would recommend you to get one from them for evaluation. But there are also other solutions out there, that fit into the same category: Fortinet, Sophos, SonicWall, Untangle,…\n\nEach of these solutions has it’s own specifics. Some you might like, some you might not. Depends a lot of your requirements, understanding of cybersec and management habits. It would not be fair to say this one is better than the other one. Sure, for me WatchGuard is the best - but possibly for you some other solution is the best one.\n\nHowever, without evaluating them, you won’t be able to find YOUR best one. You might be fooled into buying someone elses ‘best of’ and regret it later.\n\nMost vendors will offer you some TradeIn discounts for replacing the SonicWall boxes - don’t forget to ask for that discount!\n\nAlso SonicWall might offer some Trade-Up discount - check that out as well.\n\nHi Bill! Going off of Bojan’s suggestion, you can request a free evaluation of one of our WatchGuard appliances here. If you need assistance on figuring out which appliance would best suit your needs (I would suggest one, but I don’t have enough info about your environment), you can use our appliance sizing tool. It will ask you for information such as number of users, require throughput and a few other pieces of helpful info. Lastly, as you currently have equipment, please know that we do have a trade-in program as well, so that should assist with your budget. If you have any questions, feel free to message or tag me at any time!\n\nHey, Bill - we have a really slick, customizable interface that you might like (a lot!):\n\nFeel free to hop on our live demo server to check it out sometime. We can do site-to-site VPN with just about any device out there. Also, you can install Untangle on custom/spare hardware (if you don’t want to buy it from us), VMWare, AWS/Azure… lots of options to help keep costs down, like bypassing VoIP traffic so it doesn’t count on your licensing , because why pay to filter those phones? They’ll still be behind the firewall, but won’t count as active hosts. It’s a handy little tool. Hit me up if you have any questions!\n\n@bill-reid\n\nHave you investigated whether or not it is actually the Sonicwalls that are causing the disconnect issues? You may be sadly disappointed when you install a new device only to find that you are going to have the same issues as you did before. This seems like a knee jerk reaction to replace something just because of a perceived complexity. A basic Sonicwall setup doesn’t need to be overly complicated and they generally work very well with the same manufacturer devices. I know you stated that a reboot fixes it, but that could be a misconfiguration, a data connection or the need for a firmware update.\n\nI’d take this as an opportunity to take a look at the whole WAN setup. Buying an MPLS type solution from a single provider would remove most of the headaches here as it would transfer them across to the supplier. Having to constantly reboot devices because the VPN falls over is why I changed direction and went MPLS and then VPLS. If the WAN supplier also supplys the hardware you can spread the cost over the term of the contract\n\nWe now have multiple sites using fiber as a primary circuit and a backup circuit on whatever is economical at the site. These are connected with VRRP so they automatically fail over in the event of a problem. This allows us to have a cloud based hosted firewall that is geographically redundant and pretty much zero downtime for only a fraction more than when we did all the work ourselves"
