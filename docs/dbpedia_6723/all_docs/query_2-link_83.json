        "text": "SonicWALL SSL VPN is available in two different products\n\nThe SonicWALL SSL VPN includes two different product lines: the Secure Mobile Access (SMA) series and the Network Security Appliance (NSA) series. The NSA series is a firewall, not an SSL VPN, but SSL VPN capabilities are available as add-on features. Both product series include multiple models, with both hardware and virtual appliances:\n\nSMA series\n\nSonicWALL SMA 200 (maximum 50 users)\n\nSonicWALL SMA 400 (maximum 250 users)\n\nSonicWALL SMA 500v (virtual appliance, maximum 250 users)\n\nSonicWALL SMA 6200 (maximum 2,000 users)\n\nSonicWALL SMA 8200v (virtual appliance, maximum 5,000 users)\n\nSonicWALL SMA 7200 (maximum 10,000 users)\n\nSonicWALL SRA EX9000 (maximum 20,000 users)\n\nNSA series\n\nSonicWALL NSA 250M (maximum 15 SSL VPN users)\n\nSonicWALL NSA 2600 (maximum 250 SSL VPN users)\n\nSonicWALL NSA 3600 (maximum 350 SSL VPN users)\n\nSonicWALL NSA 4600 (maximum 500 SSL VPN users)\n\nSonicWALL NSA 5600 (maximum 1,000 SSL VPN users)\n\nSonicWALL NSA 6600 (maximum 1,500 SSL VPN users)\n\nMost models of the SonicWALL SSL VPN are hardware-based, so the user must purchase the appliance in addition to licenses. Each model comes with a small number of licenses, with the option to purchase more to accommodate more concurrent users. Surge pricing, known as a Spike License, is also available for high-activity periods of emergency, such as in the case of disaster recovery.\n\nClient and authentication support for the SonicWALL SSL VPN\n\nThere are four different client support options for an SSL VPN: clientless, browser plug-in, stand-alone executable and mobile app. The SonicWALL SSL VPN supports clientless, browser plug-in and mobile app connections. Because of this, virtually any type of device can connect to the protected network using most web browsers. The SonicWALL Mobile Connect app, which allows mobile devices to connect to the private network, is available on iOS, OS X, Windows, Android, Chrome and Amazon Kindle Fire devices.\n\nThe SonicWALL SSL VPN supports many common enterprise authentication methods, including two-factor authentication and one-time passwords. It also supports single-sign on capabilities.\n\nThe SonicWALL SSL VPN comes with network access control features, which ensure that devices connecting to the network are safe. This includes checking for antivirus and antispyware software and personal firewalls, detecting jailbroken or rooted mobile devices, verifying domain membership and OS version, and identifying digital certificates on the device. The SonicWALL SSL VPN software allows for detailed, customizable, granular access control, providing administrators with the ability to specify exactly which information and applications are available to each user.\n\nThe SonicWALL SSL VPN SRA series and NSA series offer security for businesses of almost any size, with up to 20,000 concurrent users on a single appliance. Employees can connect to the VPN on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops and mobile devices, as well as on a variety of web browsers, making it a good option for most businesses."
