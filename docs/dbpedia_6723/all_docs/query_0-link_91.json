        "text": "About the Anti-Spyware Page\n\nThe Security Services > Anti-Spyware page displays the configuration settings for managing the service on your Dell SonicWALL security appliance. You must enable and configure Anti-Spyware on the SonicWALL management interface before anti-spyware policies are applied to your network traffic.\n\nThe Security Services > Anti-Spyware page is divided into three sections:\n\nAnti-Spyware Status\n\nThe Anti-Spyware Status section shows the state of the signature database, including the database's timestamp and the time the SonicWALL signature servers were last checked for the most current signatures. The SonicWALL security appliance automatically attempts to synchronize the database on startup, and once every hour.\n\nYou can update the signature database at anytime by clicking the Update button.\n\nAnti-Spyware Global Settings\n\nThe Anti-Spyware Global Settings section allows you to:\n\nSignature Groups\n\nThe Signature Groups table lists the danger levels of spyware and allows you to specify whether to prevent and/or detect all of a level:\n\nProtocols\n\nThe Protocols table lists the various protocols for which you can enable inbound inspection.\n\nAnti-Spyware Policies\n\nThe Anti-Spyware Policies section allows you to view and manage how SonicWALL Anti-Spyware handles signatures by category groups or on a signature by signature basis. Categories are signatures grouped together by product or manufacturer, and they are listed in the View Style menu.\n\nThe Anti-Spyware Policies table lists entries from the Dell SonicWALL Anti-Spyware signature database downloaded to your firewall. Categories and signatures are dynamically updated by the Anti-Spyware Service. Categories and signatures dynamically change over time in response to new threats.\n\nDisplaying Signatures\n\nYou can display the signatures in a variety of views using the View Style menu. This menu allows you to specify the categories or signatures to display in the Anti-Spyware Policies table. You can select All Signatures, or you can select the first letter or number in the spyware name.\n\nSelecting All Signatures from the menu displays all the categories and their signatures from the database. The category headers divide the signature entries.\n\nAbout the Anti-Spyware Policies Table\n\nThe Anti-Spyware Policies table displays the following information about each signature entry:\n\nThese dialogs allow you to define a different action from the global settings for the specific category or signature.\n\nDisplaying SonicALERT Information\n\nIn the Anti-Spyware Policies table, clicking on the spyware name link in Name column, displays a SonicALERT page that provides detailed information about the spyware.\n\nSearching the Signature Database\n\nYou can search the signature database by entering a search string in the Lookup Signatures Containing String field, and then clicking icon.\n\nSorting Category or Signature Entries"
