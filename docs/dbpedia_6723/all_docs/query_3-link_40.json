        "text": "I cannot vpn with this app since I just updated to 5.0.2 No way to roll back. You need to fix it ASAP since I will need it for the whole week while Iâm away. Thanks\n\nNow the app isnât working for 16.1\n\nHow come you cannot test during the iOS betas like other app developers so this would not happen over and over?\n\nI've used this SonicWall app for many years. After updating to 16.1 I cannot connect. Meaning I have to get to my laptop or go into the office when I get a support call! I'm going to have to replace the VPN hardware at my clients if this doesn't get resolved soon. They will not be pleased when I get them the bill.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for listening! The latest update fixed my connection problem.\n\nIf you use the app with T-Mobile as your cell data provider (because they adopted IPv6) , once VPN is established you canât RDP connect to any local host using IPv4 IP address, ONLY using hostname. And for that to work you need to add rules for NETBIOS traffic from sslvpn to lan.\n\nI have reported this issue to SonicWall 2 YEARS (!!!) ago, was told they are aware and promised it will be fixed within next release yet it still doesnât work.\n\nWeâve been loyal SonicWall customer for many years, deployed their appliances to many clients, but sometime it makes me wondering why Dell got rid of SonicWall brand so quickly after acquiring it few years back..."
