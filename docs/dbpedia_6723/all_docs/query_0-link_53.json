        "text": "We have a Sonicwall NSA 3600 and the Comprehensive/Advanced Gateway Security Suite license will expire soon. When this does expire will it still continue to work as for the Access rules, NAT policies, routing, VPN?\n\nOnly the Botnet filter, CSC Management, Gateway AV, Anti-spyware, Intrusion prevention, app control, content filtering, and support that will stop working.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nIt’s only a question, if you really want to run a firewall downgraded for all the modern security services.\n\nIf you had licensed them, but didn’t see any value in them… than I’m afraid, that either they were not (correctly) implemented, or simply there is no understanding about what they are good for.\n\nDifferent story: when you are buying a new box with services and try to figure out the remaining value of the old box. In that case, there is plenty value in it, even without active security services.\n\nThere could only be a problem, if you used the old box for a Trade-Up, to get the new box cheaper. There was just today another topic, where the user was told, that Sonicwall is bricking the old unit.\n\nI don’t know if that ‘bricking’ is really making the old box completely useless. Some other brands don’t go that far and old devices remain pretty useful, even when you can’t upgrade the firmware anymore."
