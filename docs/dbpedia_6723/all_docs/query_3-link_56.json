What is SonicWALL Mobile Connect?\n\nSonicWall Mobile Connect is a free app, which needs a concurrent user license on one of the SonicWALL router solutions to function properly. SonicWall secures Mobile Access in 100 Series / SRA appliances running 7.5 or higher.\n\n10. What is Netextender Dell?\n\nNetExtender empowers Dell SonicWALL with Secured Remote Access (SRA) 4600 and 1600, adding facilities such as seamless and secure access to any resource on the corporate network, including servers or custom applications. It is not a fat client.\n\nNetExtender is an SSL VPN client for securing Windows, Mac, or Linux users which can be downloaded easily and allow us to run any application securely on the company's network. It uses the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).\n\n11. How can the Sonicwall firewall be configured step by step?\n\nWe need to create an access rule:\n\nFirstly we need to log on to the Sonicwall firewall device.\n\nThen we should click the Firewall button.\n\nThen we should click the Matrix or Dropdown boxes View Style radio button.\n\nFollowed by clicking the appropriate Zone (such as WAN to LAN).\n\nLastly, we need to click the Add button which appears at the bottom of the menu.\n\n12. How can we access the SonicWALL management interface?\n\nWe need to run the Setup Tool to discover Sonicwall’s IP address. Then we should try to ping the Sonic Wall's LAN interface IP and the upstream device's IP. We can use Sonic OS Command Line Interface (CLI) guide better known as the console port and use appropriate commands to reset the settings.\n\n13. How to Create a NAT Policy?\n\nThe Network Address Translation (NAT) engine in SonicWALL allows users to define granular NAT policies for their incoming and outgoing traffic. By default, the SonicWALL security device has a preconfigured NAT policy to allow all computers connected to the LAN to perform many to one NAT.\n\nIt allows using the IP address of the WAN interface, and a policy not to perform NAT when traffic across other interfaces.\n\n14. Can we configure various NAT Policies concurrently?\n\nA NAT policy provides us the flexibility to control Network Address Translation based on combinations of Source IP address, Destination IP address, and Destination Services. Policy-based NAT allows us to activate different types of NAT at the same time. Following NAT configurations are available in SonicWALL.\n\nMany to One NAT Policy\n\nMany to Many NAT Policy\n\nOne to One NAT Policy for Outbound Traffic\n\nOne to One NAT Policy for Inbound Traffic (Reflexive)\n\nOne to Many NAT Load Balancing\n\nInbound Port Address Translation via One to One NAT Policy\n\nInbound Port Address Translation via WAN IP Address.\n\n15. How can we configure NAT Policies?\n\nTo configure a Many-to-One NAT policy that allows all computers on the X1 interface to initiate traffic using the SonicWALL security appliance’s WAN IP address, we need to perform the following steps:\n\nNavigate to Network > NAT Policies page and click on Add. Then Add NAT Policy dialog box is displayed.\n\nFor Original Source, select the option Any.\n\nFor Translated Source, we need to select WAN Interface IP.\n\nFor Original Destination, we need to select Any.\n\nFor the Translated Destinations, we need to select Original.\n\nFor Original Service, we need to select Any.\n\nFor Translated Service, we need to select Original.\n\nFor Inbound Interface, we need to select X1.\n\nFor Outbound Interface, we need to select X1.\n\nIn the Comment, we need to enter a short description.\n\nFollowed by clicking on the Enable NAT Policy checkbox.\n\nWe need to Leave Create a reflexive policy unchecked.\n\nFinally Click Add.\n\n16. What is the difference between gateway and firewall within a network?\n\nNetwork gateways connect two networks together whereas a firewall acts as a shield to the computer against unauthorized incoming or outgoing access. Firewalls can be installed within a network as hardware devices or software programs.\n\n17. What is the difference between IPS and firewall?\n\nThe main function of a firewall is to manage traffic flow from an outside network. A firewall cannot detect an attack in which the data is deviating from its regular pattern, whereas IPS can easily detect and reset that connection with its inbuilt anomaly detection.\n\n18. What do you mean by a transparent firewall?\n\nA transparent firewall is thought to be a Layer 2 in any network. Installing a new firewall into a network can be a complicated process due to various issues for e.g. IP address reconfiguration, network topology changes, current firewall, etc.\n\nSince the firewall is not a routed hop, we can easily introduce a transparent firewall into an existing network.\n\n19. What do you mean by packet filtering?\n\nPacket filtering is the process of allowing or block IP packets based on their source and destination addresses, ports, or protocols. The packet filter examines the header of each data packet based on a specific set of rules. On that basis, it decides to block it or allow crossing.\n\nPacket filtering is also part to protect a local network from unwanted access.\n\n20. Define stateful inspection?\n\nStateful inspection is also known as dynamic packet filtering which is a firewall technology that supervises the state of active connections and analyses this information to determine which network packets are allowed through the firewall.\n\nStateful inspection analyses packets within the application layer.\n\n21. What is Public Key Encryption?\n\nPublic key encryption is a method that is used for encryption and decryption. In this system, a public key is used to encrypt messages and only the corresponding private key can decrypt them. For sending an encrypted message, the sender has to know the recipient’s public key too.\n\n22. What is Authorization?\n\nAuthorization is a method of security used to determine user or client privileges and access levels which are related to network resources, including firewalls, routers, switches, and other security application features.\n\nAuthorization is normally followed after the authentication process and during authorization. It’s a system that checks an authenticated user’s access rules and either grant or blocks the resource access.\n\n23. What is stateful failover?\n\nEach time a session is generated for a flow of traffic on the primary node, it is synced to the secondary node too. When the primary node fails, sessions continue to pass traffic through the second node without having to re-establish the link.\n\n24. What is VPN and describe IPsec VPN?\n\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) generates a secure network connection over any public network such as the internet. IPsec VPN means VPN over IP Security allows two or more users to communicate securely by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet within a communication session.\n\n25. What is Site to Site and remote access VPN?\n\nA site-to-site VPN permits offices in multiple locations to establish secure connections with each other over a public network such as the Internet. Site-to-site VPN is unlike other remote-access VPN as it removes the need for each computer to run VPN client software as if it is on a remote access VPN.\n\n26. How do you check the status of the tunnel’s phases 1 & 2?\n\nThe following commands are used to check the status of tunnel phases:\n\nPhase 1: show crypto isakmp and State: MM_ACTIVE\n\nPhase 2: show crypto IPsec SA\n\nIf we have a lot of tunnels and the output is very confusing, then we can use a ‘show crypto IPsec SA peer 12.12.12.12’ command.\n\n27. What is SSL VPN? How is it different from IPsec VPN?\n\nSSL VPN facilitates remote access connectivity from any internet-enabled location without any special client from the remote site. We need a web browser and its native SSL encryption.\n\nIPsec is a dedicated point-to-point fixed VPN connection where SSL VPNs provide connectivity without any configuration or special software at the remote location.\n\n28. What is GRE and why is it required?\n\nGeneric Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a protocol that encapsulates packets in order to route other protocols over IP networks.\n\nGRE places a wrapper around a packet during the transmission of the data. After receiving, GRE removes the wrapper and enables the original packet for processing by the receiving stack.\n\nFollowing are the Advantages of GRE tunnels:\n\nThe tunnels connect discontinuous sub-networks.\n\nIt allows VPNs across wide area networks (WANs).\n\nIt encases multiple protocols over a single protocol backbone.\n\nThe tunnels provide workarounds for networks with limited hops.\n\n29. At Which levels Firewalls works? Define firewall generations and their roles?\n\nFirewalls generally work at layers 3, 4 & 7. First-generation firewalls provided packet filtering and operate at layer 3 (Network Layer). Second-generation firewalls can operate up to the Transport layer (layer 4) and record all connectivity passing through it and decides whether a packet is the start of a new connection or a part of an existing connection, or without any part of the connection.\n\nSecond-generation firewalls are fundamentally used for Stateful Inspection.\n\nThird-generation firewalls can operate at layer 7. The key benefit of this application-layer filtering is that it can “understand” certain applications and protocols (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)) on its own\n\n30. What is a DoS attack? How can it be prevented?\n\nDoS (Denial of Service) attack can be produced by sending a flood of data or requests to a target system resulting in either consumption or crash of the target system’s resources. The attacker often uses IP spoofing to conceal his identity when launching a DoS attack."
