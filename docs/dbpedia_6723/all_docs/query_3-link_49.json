        "text": "Hi\n\nWe have a Billion Biguard S20 which has all the features we need; dual wan, SSL VPN, packet filtering etc, except for the fact that if we download large amounts of data from the Internet it appears to stall for a few seconds, resulting in no Internet access for the duration. It’s obviously not quite powerful enough for us and I’d like to relegate it back to being our SSL VPN for remote users.\n\nI’m after a replacement basic firewall for up to 50 concurrent users that won’t require an expensive software subscription just to get the thing to work as a firewall. It needs to have a configurable packet filter to allow traffic in to internal servers from specific external addresses on specific ports, rather than just the catch all virtual server that some cheaper routers have.\n\nI’ve been looking at the Sonicwall range, starting with the TZ210, but after being given a quote for the TZ210 I’ve now been told that it is actually no good for us because it won’t be powerful enough. The reseller also said that the NSA 240 (at twice the price) is the better bet.They also said that Sonicwall has told them that the NSA 240 doesn’t really do anything without a subscription. At £450 per year for the CGSS subs I can’t justify the cost. We are a poor charity (pity us!)\n\nSo, my questions; can anyone tell me if the Sonicwall NSA 240 really does nothing without a subscription, bearing in mind that I only need a firewall?\n\nAlso, are there any reasonable firewalls for under £1000 that won’t require me to keep handing money over just to keep it working as a firewall and for firmware updates?\n\nThanks\n\nStratt\n\nHi\n\nFrom a charity too so I know the pain of firewall subscription costs. We do have the Sonicwall NSA240, without subscription you would have basic firewall services for unlimited number of users, 2 VPN and 2 SSL VPN licenses.\n\nYou would not even get basic software updates after the 1st month if I remember right.\n\nYou should check out http://www.ctxchange.org they have donation ware programs for Cisco with ASA 5505 and 5510 devices available sub-£300 with 5 year SMARTnet support\n\nThe other solution could be an Untangle box.\n\nWe didn’t go the Cisco route because back when I started I didn’t know they existed\n\nYour reseller is an idiot. If you go to Sonicwall, they have charts based on the basic functions and the additions you may or may not want. Things like additional SSL licenses (you get 2 built in), Content Filtering, A/V and AntiSpyware filtering management, etc.\n\nAt its heart, it is a firewall. You can use it out of the box. They do (and I would recommend also) to keep the warranty subscription up-to-date. But that is not a subscription for other services, but warranty for the box, tech support (they are good), and firmware updates.\n\nHere is the comparison chart for the NSA series:\n\nhttp://www.sonicwall.com/us/products/NSA_Series.html#tab=compare\n\nEdit: you might want to look at TZ yourself and see if they were just trying to push you to a more expensive model. Here is the comparison chart for the TZ series:\n\nhttp://www.sonicwall.com/us/products/TZ_Series.html#tab=compare\n\nThe SonicWall NS 240 is a fair choice for a network that isn’t too big; while there is a smaller NS level unit, I would get smaller than that. I recently replaced a Pro 2400 with an NS 240 and nobody has complained.\n\nOut of the box there are two SSL VPN licenses (essentially for management). The firewall feature which are the devices primary function are built in to the unit and don’t require additional licenses to activate. It’s the additional features that SonicWall and their resellers want you to pile on that cost more (IPS, A/V, etc).\n\nThe support is a must for at least as long as the device itself is considered viable by SonicWall (this means they are actively developing the firmware) and I would get the full support that include device replacement upon failure although I will only pay for 8x5 support because I know from experience that a failure at 5PM on a Friday night still means a replacement firewall on Tuesday then next week and I haven’t had a firewall issue yet that I’ve felt like troubleshooting with support over the weekend.\n\nOriginally I liked the SonicWall for it’s ease of use; I could walk almost anyone through the interface. As the product has matured (I’ve been using them since early 2000) I have been impressed by the robust feature set and granularity of control I’ve been able to achieve with them. Even connecting One SonicWall to two remote sites with the same IP address scheme."
