We will continue to offer creative ways to meet supply-chain demands, reduce TCO and ensure our partners and their businesses are position for success.”\n\nSonicWall has been the recipient of several CRN awards in the second half of 2022:\n\nCRN 2022 Annual Report Card: SonicWall earned a spot as a winner in the Enterprise Network Security category of the prestigious list.\n\nCRN 100 People You Should Know: SonicWall’s Senior Director of Global Field Marketing Nicola Scheibe was included on CRN’s annual list.\n\nCRN 2022 Edge Computing 100: SonicWall and its Capture Cloud Platform earned a spot as one of the 25 hottest edge security companies.\n\nCRN Tech Innovators : SonicWall’s NSa 5700 firewall stood out among the competition and won the Best Enterprise Network Security category.\n\nCRN Products of the Year: Customers cited SonicWall’s next-generation firewall as a need in the marketplace.\n\n“CRN’s Products of the Year Awards are always one of the year’s most talked about industry lists. Our 2022 honorees are all leading vendors who set themselves apart by their unflagging commitment to industry excellence for channel partners and their customers,” said Blaine Raddon, CEO of The Channel Company. “It’s a distinct honor to recognize these innovative products and services which each set a very high bar for solution providers looking to expand their portfolio based on technological innovation, financial opportunity, and market need.”\n\nInnovating pricing strategy, re-launching ‘3 & Free’ program\n\nSonicWall is listening to its partner community and innovating based on their direct feedback. To offset rising costs industry-wide, SonicWall is evolving its pricing structures to ensure its partners remain successful — both in the short-term and well into the future.\n\nIn early December, SonicWall announced the ‘3 & Free’ promotion for select TZ370 and TZ470 models . SonicWall customers need to purchase a three-year license of our most popular Advanced Protection Service Suite (APSS), and they’ll receive an eligible TZ firewall for free. This offering complements the ‘3 & Free’ bundling promotion announced for the NS a 2700 and NSa 3700 in November 2022.\n\n“While other vendors are raising hardware prices as much as 35% in some areas, SonicWall is being proactive to support long-term savings and reduced TCO for customers,” said SonicWall EVP, America Sales Jason Carter. “SonicWall will be limiting price adjustments to one-year security service subscriptions and concurrently is taking the unprecedented step of decreasing costs of two- and three-year security service subscriptions.”\n\nSonicWall Enhances MySonicWall UI, Releases new SonicWave Wireless Access Point\n\nIn another step to help its partners, SonicWall has published an updated user interface (UI) to the MSSP Monthly licensing feature in MySonicWall . The new release includes a new and improved user experience to help provision tenants and products and provide access to users via user groups. It also now supports two-factor authentication (2FA), integration with Microsoft Azure AD and other Identity Providers via SAML, and multi-tier multi-tenancy for master MSSPs and License Aggregators.\n\nAdditionally, SonicWall is announcing the availability of the SonicWall SonicWave 621 , a ceiling-mountable wireless access point suitable for indoor single-unit or multi-unit deployments.\n\nAbout SonicWall\n\nSonicWall delivers Boundless Cybersecurity for the hyper-distributed era in a work reality where everyone is remote, mobile and unsecure.
