        "text": "When owned by Dell, a SonicWall firewall was installed in virtually every Dell laptop and desktop computer. However, despite broad product distribution and use, there was little SonicWall brand awareness once the brand was spun off.\n\nOur challenge was to take a widely used but little-known brand and position it for success in both the mid-market where it had significant market share and in the larger enterprise market dominated by larger, much better-known competitors such as Cisco and Palo Alto Networks.\n\nFrom a review of competitor advertising and messaging, most used stereotypical images of hackers in hoodies breaking into computer networks. The point of this imagery was fear. We took the opposite approach.\n\nWhile no doubt cyber threats like phishing scams, malware and ransomware attacks are to be taken seriously, we developed the brand promise of Fear Less. With SonicWall firewalls protecting your networks you don’t have to be afraid of these threats. Vigilance is the key, and with SonicWall you can do more and fear less.\n\nTo support this brand promise, we recommended the Hero archetype. Hero brands save the day, offer protection and are always up for a fight. In addition, Hero brands are unique in that they operate in a couple of ways. First, they are the hero. In the case of SonicWall, their products are defending millions of networks. Second, these brands make their customers the hero. So, in the case of IT professionals responsible for critical infrastructure, they are the hero for making the right decision to protect their networks with SonicWall products and services."
