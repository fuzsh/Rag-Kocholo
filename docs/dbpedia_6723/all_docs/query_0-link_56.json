        "text": "I'll be the first to say I'm not happy with our Sonicwalls. But I've been pleasantly surprised with the GAV portion. Does it work as your only AV solution? Absolutely not. But it's done a pretty good job at recognizing the Blackhole exploit kit websites that are at the end of someone clicking links in a phishing E-Mail. I can usually tell when some new batch of spam made it through the mail filters, because a handful of people start clicking, and triggering the GAV block. I'd definitely recommend GAV via UTM (Even if it's Sonicwall) as part of a layered defense. The other layer? Getting a better client Antivirus on your machines.\n\nI think SonicWalls are awesome devices. We have quite a few NSA3500's around our offices and datacenters and I love them.\n\nBut, the AV portion sucks. It's almost worthless.\n\nIn the statistics for our main office 3500, it shows that over the last 21 days it has blocked 4 Viruses (Virii?). They were labeled...\n\nFakeAV.A_6 75% Suspicious#themida.4 25%\n\nNow, I KNOW my users haven't gotten smart over the last 21 days and stopped clicking on shiz that they shouldn't. The sonicwall just isn't catching hardly anything at all.\n\nSo if you're looking to get one simply for the AV, take the word of a SonicWall enthusiast: No, do not get one.\n\nFirst of all, based on my experiences with them, Sonicwall SUCKS. I mean, I generally hate all AV products, with a couple exceptions that are \"alright,\" but don't get a Sonicwall. They're just... awful. I've had nothing but problems with every Sonciwall device I've administered. YMMV.\n\nBut yes, a webfilter can help to some degree. How much... well, that depends, and brings me to your comment below.\n\nThey have admin access to their machines, and that's not going to change.\n\nThen you may be screwed, no matter what you do. Even experienced sysadmins and IT folk don't regularly run as admins. (Ones who know what the hell they're doing don't, anyway.) At the very least, get them to log on with limited credentials and use RunAs/Run as Administrator when they need to do something with admin credentials.\n\nThere's simply no defending against the countless unpatched and zero-day vulnerabilities floating out on the web if you run everything as an admin. They'll get you every time because Java/Flash/your browser/whatever is running with administrative access and will install any nasty bit of code it's asked to. That's why MSSE is letting you down. Not because it's a bad product, but because nothing protects against 100% of the crap out there, and your users are running in such a way as to allow 100% of the undiscovered crap out there to infect them."
