We have two locations with about 50 users each, one VPN tunnel, (sharing internet and VOIP) and a lot of SQL traffic, (mainly moving one way). We are also thinking about splitting the Internet to a different vendor to save on VPN traffic but stil need it to run through the firewall.\n\nEverything I’ve read Sonicwall is well rated, but I’m wondering what other brand would be feature and cost similar.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nWe are currently deploying SonicWalls across the board and those are replacing many WatchGuard devices.\n\nThis WatchGuard site shows the XTM appliances side-by-side for throughputs.\n\nhttp://www.watchguard.com/products/xtm-main.asp\n\nThis site is for your TZ 215: http://www.sonicwall.com/us/products/TZ_215.html#tab=specifications\n\nIn all, I have been very happy with the SonicWall performance and ease of use so far. The WatchGuards will likely be a little less expensive, but cost vs. performance to equal value and SonicWall wins in my opinion.\n\nDave\n\nI have to disagree with David9308 on using Sonicwalls (like the car, mine’s black!). I have 80 Sonicwall TZ100s deployed at the moment and they are next to useless. For my next batch of sites, I’m installing Watchguard XTM25s. Here’s why: The Sonicwall has terrible Gateway AV protection - I have been hit 10 times this week with the same malware. It’s not a configuration issue as I am using the configuration Sonicwall recommended for this. The units crash. I’ve seen this happen with other firewalls in the past if you really pound them, but we are not putting that much data through these things to cause that. They slow down your connection dramatically - I had one set up at home without the AV and IPS etc turned on, and I couldn’t even play a Youtube video without waiting for it to load; when I removed the Sonicwall, everything went back to normal. I was quoted $35,000 for centralized management. Finally, they want over $200 a year to keep the Gateway AV, IPS, content filter etc active.\n\nHere’s why I like Watchguard: they get their AV from AVG, during testing at my stores (rollout starts in 2 weeks), there were no stability issues. They have centralized management included. I’ve used Watchguard in the past, albeit just as a firewall, not a UTM, and they have been reliable units.\n\nWe have a Sonicwall NSA3500 in our head office, which we are just using as a firewall. This unit has been bulletproof, but we are not even getting close to capacity on what it can do, nor are we using Gateway AV etc on it.\n\nWell, be that as it may, the OP wasn’t asking about the TZ100. I believe those are the lowest end firewall that SonicWall makes. The TZ 215 has a lot more horsepower. in addition, you can tweak the gateway A/V to get the best performance for your connection.\n\nThe Gateway A/V doesn’t look for or catch spyware. Anti-spyware is a separate category on the SonicWalls that we have. That’s where you configure those settings. In any case, you can request demo units from your SonicWall reseller and see for yourself how you like or dislike the performance."
