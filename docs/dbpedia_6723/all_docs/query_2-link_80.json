        "text": "Itâs an unspoken code among entrepreneurs and CEOâs all over the world – if youâre passionate about your business, you want to protect it the best way. Whether you own a small company, or a multinational conglomerate, you will do whatever it takes to keep it safe. No one knows that better than SonicWall, a Silicon Valley-based company that sells a range of Internet appliances primarily directed at content control and network security.\n\nIn fact, itâs one of the reasons why they created SonicWall SOHO 250, a security firewall targeted towards small businesses that require the same level of protection most organisations get, but at a more affordable price. Ideal for home offices, small offices, and distributed enterprises such as restaurants and retail chains, SonicWallâs SOHO 250 provides high-speed threat prevention and software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) technology all enclosed in a flexible, integrated security solution.\n\nWhy Choose SonicWall SOHO 250?Â\n\nWhen you use SonicWall SOHO 250, you are assured of big-business protection and uncompromising security. In other words, users are able to take full advantage of high-speed broadband, without compromising the highly effective protection needed to stop cyberattacks. On top of all that, distributed retail businesses, and even campus environments, can take advantage of the many other tools of SonicWall to gain even greater benefits.\n\nWhat are those other benefits, you may ask? Well, thanks to SonicWall SOHO 250, branch locations of businesses are able to exchange information securely with the central office using Virtual Private Networking (VPN). Creating virtual LANs (VLANs) enables segmentation of the network into separate corporate and customer groups with rules that determine the level of communication with devices on other VLANs.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, SonicWall SOHO 250 is equipped with software-defined wide area networking technology or (SD-WAN). A big benefit of SD-WAN is its low cast, it works as a secure alternative to costly MPLS circuits while still being able to deliver consistent application performance and availability.\n\nTo those unaware of the concept, MPLS, short for Multiprotocol Label Switching, is a routing technique done by telecommunications networks.The technique involves directing data from one node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, thus avoiding complex look ups in a routing table and speeding traffic flows.\n\nThe thing about MPLS is that itâs a technique, not a service, so it can deliver anything from IP VPNs to metro Ethernet. However, since it is rather costly, many businessmen are looking at SD-WAN, software-defined wide area networking technology, as a viable alternative. With SD-WAN, you get the same results as MPLS – at a much lesser price.\n\nAnother big feature of SonicWall SOHO 250 is its Zero-Touch Deployment capability. Zero-Touch Deployment makes it easy for the SonicWall SOHO 250 to be deployed to remote locations.Â Zero-Touch Deployment enables provisioning of the firewall remotely through the cloud.\n\nOn a final note as to why you should buy the SonicWall SOHO 250…SOHO 250 is a prime product of the SonicWall TZ series, a group of firewalls that offer integrated security solutions for small to medium enterprises. SonicWall SOHO 250 is one of the newest additions to the TZ series, along with the SonicWall TZ350. If youâre going to invest in your business, you might as well invest in the most technologically-advanced of the lot.\n\nTo put it simply, these new firewalls, SOHO 250 and TZ350 are quite literally SonicWallâs cream of the crop, they protect more connected devices, have higher speeds, and offer simple deployment & management of SonicWallâs first-class protection for your network â all in a compact, desktop package.\n\nPros\n\nEnterprise Grade Network Protection\n\nDeep Packet Inspection Of All Traffic Without Restrictions On File Size Or Protocol\n\nSecure 802.11ac Wireless Connectivity Using Integrated Wireless Controller Or Via External SonicPoint Wireless Access Points\n\nSSL VPN Mobile Access For Apple iOS, Google Android, Amazon Kindle, Windows, Mac OS And Linux Devices\n\nOver 100 additional Ports Can Be Securely Managed By The TZ Console When Deployed In Combination With Dell X-Series Switches\n\nCons\n\nLacks After Sales Support\n\nSoftware/ GUI bugs\n\nKey Features\n\nRFDI Engine\n\nSonicWallâs high-performance, proprietary and patented inspection engine performs stream-based, bi-directional traffic analysis, without proxying or buffering, to uncover intrusion attempts and malware, and to identify application traffic regardless of port.\n\nSecure SD-WAN\n\nAn alternative to more expensive technologies such as MPLS, secure SD-WAN enables distributed enterprise organizations to build, operate and manage secure, high-performance networks across remote sites for the purpose of sharing data, applications and services using readily-available, low-cost public Internet services.\n\nCloud-Based And On-Premises Management\n\nConfiguration ad management of SonicWall appliances is available via the cloud through the SonicWall Capture Security Center and on premises using SonicWall Global Management System (GMS).\n\nVirtual Private Networking\n\nSimplifies and reduces complex distributed firewall deployment down to a trivial effort by automating the initial site-to-site VPN gateway provisioning between SonicWall firewalls, while security and connectivity occurs instantly and automatically.\n\nContent And Context AwarenessÂ\n\nIdentifies and controls network traffic going to or coming from specific countries to either protect against attacks from known or suspected origins of threat activity, or to investigate suspicious traffic originating from the network.\n\nThis feature provides the ability to create custom country and Botnet lists to override an incorrect country, or a Botnet tag associated with an IP address. The Content And Context Awareness feature eliminates unwanted filtering of IP addresses due to misclassification.\n\nCapture Advanced Threat Protection\n\nThe multi-engine sandbox platform, which includes virtualized sandboxing, full system emulation, and hypervisor level analysis technology, executes suspicious code and analyzes behavior, providing comprehensive visibility to malicious activity.\n\nEncrypted Threat Prevention\n\nDecrypts and inspects TLS/SSL encrypted traffic on the fly, without proxying, for malware, intrusions and data leakage. It also applies application, URL and content control policies in order to protect against threats hidden in encrypted traffic.\n\nApplication Intelligence And control\n\nControl applications, or individual application features, that are identified by the RFDPI engine against a continuously expanding database of over thousands of application signatures, to increase network security and enhance network productivity.\n\nContent Filtering\n\nBlocks content using the predefined categories or any combination of categories. Filtering can be scheduled by time of day, such as during school or business hours, and applied to individual users or groups.\n\nEnforce Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware\n\nPowerful spyware protection scans and blocks the installation of a comprehensive array of spyware programs on desktops and laptops before they transmit confidential data, providing greater desktop security and performance."
