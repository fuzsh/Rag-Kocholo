        "text": "The 10.0.0.1 IP Address\n\nThe 10.0.0.1 IP address is special because it can be used more than once. It belongs to the 24-bit block of private IP address, which are used for local area networks (LANs). Unlike public IP addresses, it’s not possible to route private IP addresses through the internet, but that doesn’t make them useless.\n\nIn fact, we can thank private IP addresses such as 10.0.0.1 for the fact that the internet as we know it hasn’t collapsed yet. There are approximately 4 billion IP addresses in the IPv4 communications protocol, which is one of the core protocols of standards-based internet-working methods in the internet, and the first regional Internet Registry run out of freely allocated IPv4 addresses on 15 April 2011.\n\nSince then, network administrators and internet providers have been relying on various methods of remapping one IP address space into another and using private IP addresses such as 10.0.0.1 as substitutes for public IP addresses.\n\nEventually, the IPv4 communications protocol will be entirely replaced by its successor, Internet Protocol Version 6, or IPv6 for short, but that will take some time. Currently, only about 25 percent of internet traffic happens through IPv6.\n\nYou could, for example, change your Xfinity router login page or Comcast router login page from 10.0.0.1 Xfinity/10.0.0.1 Comcast to 10.0.4.1 or 10.125.3.1. As long as you stay between 10.0.0.0 and 10.255.255.255, you can use any IP address you want, so 10.0.0.0.1 Xfinity or 10.0.0.0.1 Comcast wouldn’t be possible.\n\nWhen you change any Wi-Fi-related settings, we highly recommend you use NetSpot, an easy-to-use professional Wi-Fi analyzer designed to tell you everything you need to know about your wireless network, to see whether your change has had a positive effect."
