        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you. Can you tell us a bit about how you grew up?\n\nI grew up in a small rural town in Georgia, where I hunted and fished with one grandfather, and did wood working, garnering, and playing chess with the other. My father was an engineer for the railroad, and my mom took care of me and my brother. My hobbies were the outdoors … riding horses, driving go-carts, motorcycles, and 4-wheelers. When I was 8-years-old, I went to visit my uncle who worked for IBM. He had a “personal” computer at home, which I found fascinating. After many letters to Santa, I finally had my first computer — the Tandy 1000EX. It was amazing and even had games that I could buy from the local store! From there, my childhood started to take its first digital transformation and Sierra Software was the driving force. Games like Kings Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Phantasmagoria all became the new daily challenge.\n\nIs there a particular story that inspired you to pursue a career in cybersecurity? We’d love to hear it.\n\nAs a kid growing up with a computer, and learning how to write basic commands, I realized early on that it was possible to do some really amazing things. When the OS started to become more user-friendly with the introduction of Windows 95, so did the introduction of viruses and other trojans. Being one that browsed user groups and BBS’s looking for programs and files, not to mention MP3s, I started finding some of the files I would download caused my computer to do odd things. Sometimes it would just hang and force me to reboot. Other times, applications I installed would lose their icons, and then clicking on the application would cause it to not even display the program. This kept peaking my interest as to how this was happening. Group chats in forums were my savior, as others experienced the same. Through discussion and education, I realized that there was something “added” to the code I downloaded. Once I realized this was now a possibility, it became the new interest for me. Once anti-virus applications emerged, that was my first purchase. From there, my interest in cybersecurity was ignited and has lead me on the path to where I am today working for a very successful cybersecurity company.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began this fascinating career?\n\nThe story I remember most is when I worked with Ricoh Corporation. I had been a desktop support person who used to run around different offices fixing computers. The CFO at the time was a gentlemen from South Africa that befriended me because he was concerned about his music that he downloaded on his company laptop (MP3s). I showed him how to store it on the hard drive of a connected copy machine. He was so fascinated, that he introduced me to the CEO of the company, who was from Japan. When the ILOVEU virus hit, the company was brought to its knees quickly, and then it was found that our copiers became replicators because we used Windows NT Server for the print servers. I worked with the network team to help fix the issues, but started talking about how we should do a better job of protecting the copiers with encrypted drives. I was sent to Japan a month later to Ricoh Worldwide HQ to discuss my idea, not knowing that they were already on track to roll out volatile memory systems and encrypted disk, but I was able to become a key part in their plan.\n\nYou are a successful leader. Which three character traits do you think were most instrumental to your success? Can you please share a story or example for each?\n\nBe creative — Being creative is important. There are so many routines that become stale in the business world. Having new, inventive ideas are what drives the future. For me, that has been a key trait of my personality. I remember the past, evaluate the present, and envision the future. In my present role, this is very critical to understanding what tomorrow will bring. If you know your customer or partner, and you understand their business, then you can create solutions that will better them, protect them, and at the same time, accelerate your company.\n\nBe trustworthy — I have always tried to be an honest person. I was brought up that being honest will build trust, and trust is important in leadership. Trust and confidence are what your employees look for in their leader. They want to know that the person they work for cares about them, understands them, and is a person that they can feel comfortable talking to and confiding in when they need something. Trust also builds your character and helps with external relationships, with the likes of customers and partners.\n\nBe humble — This is one attribute that I have always had, and I feel is something all should have in any environment. Everyone is replaceable. You should work hard because it’s the right thing to do, not because you want to be better than anybody else. However, “humble” in my term is also not doubting yourself, or feeling you are inferior to others. It’s not a form of low self esteem, but a more sympathetic approach to realizing your potential, and the potentials of others.\n\nAre you working on any exciting new projects now? How do you think that will help people?\n\nAt the moment, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the newest trend. Trying to keep up with the changes that are happening almost hourly is daunting, and in the security business, you have to keep an eye on trends and changes, as the threat landscape is ever evolving. If we keep up with these trends and the changes in AI and technology advancements, it will help shift security products to become trained or more focused on new and emerging threats, and thus better protecting our customers.\n\nOk super. Thank you for all that. Let’s now shift to the main focus of our interview. Can you provide an example of a real-world incident where compromised integrity in the supply chain led to product security issues? How was the situation addressed, and what lessons can other organizations learn from that experience?\n\nSupply chain attacks have been around for a long time, but have become way more noticable recently. The one that I remember the most was when Oracle’s POS (Point Of Sales) Micros system was compromised. The hackers were able to compromise the supplier’s software distribution system, thus allowing malware to be pushed out to their many customers terminals. All while being a legit connection and update. However, that update allowed the cyber criminals to steal millions of credit cards numbers before being caught. This obviously created a tremendous amount of claims, cost millions of dollars in fines, and required a complete overhaul of the entire security infrastructure.\n\nThe lesson is simple — manufacturers that push down updates to subscribed systems have a responsibility above and beyond to ensure the saftey of those devices that are receiving the updates. Manufacturers must invest in the right security, the right infrastructure, and must utilize 3rd party testing to verify their security is indeed working as expected.\n\nAre there any regulatory frameworks or industry standards that address the importance of supply chain integrity in the manufacturing sector? How can organizations align their practices with these standards to enhance product security?\n\nWhen we talk about supply chain, there are numerous items that can be framed into that statement. Food, Drugs, Techology, Medical, etc. Each area has dedicated regulations or specific guidelnes. For example, the FDA regulates food and drugs, and thus they have specific regulations and guidelines for the manufacturer to know where the ingredents are coming from, understand who had access to those ingredients, quality assurance and control over the use of those ingrediants, and testing to ensure the integrety of the product being sold to consumers. The cyber security industry is similar in many ways. Manufacturers of security products do have some guidelines that they can reference for supply chain security/integrity. For example, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a Critical Manufacturing Sector Security Guide in 2020 that oulines the necessities for tracking where products come from, how they are used, quality assurance, and testing.\n\nHow does the concept of traceability tie into ensuring integrity in the manufacturing supply chain? What role does it play in identifying potential security breaches or vulnerabilities?\n\nThis is really not a concept, but a requirement depending what industry your product is manufactured to work in. For security products, it is critical to know where the chipsets for your product come from. It’s critical to understand if the Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) has cleared people with proper background checks to work on chip sets that may be placed in sensitive devices. It’s imperitive to know who has access to your designs, who is working on your products, and its imperative to “double check” everything. For example, this is a critical and required process to sell into the military. Since the military operates in extreme situations and infrastructure integrity is critical, they look for manufacturers to know where their products are coming from, ensure that no unauthroized parts are used by countries whom are on a list, and to ensure full integrety from all points.\n\nAre there any emerging trends or technologies in the manufacturing sector that can help enhance product security and supply chain integrity? How can organizations leverage these trends to stay ahead of potential threats?\n\nI am unaware of any emerging technologies that would enhance supply chain integrety. However, there are guidelines that are bieng issued by the government, there are tracing and testing protocols that should be followed, and if selling within the government, they have the right to request those protocols and the results of the trace. As more political events emerge around the world, there may eventually be more regulatory compliances that put monitary fines on companies that do not trace their supply chain.\n\nOk, thank you. Here is the main question of our interview. What are the “5 Things We Must Do To Ensure Product Security in the Manufacturing Sector?” and why?\n\n1 . Know your supplier (and their suppliers) — Hold your supplier accountable, and ensure the supplier does not have any political ties to compromise trust. Know who they use, and put regulations in place to esnure they only buy from those who are approved. And if items are not available, implement processes that can evaluate alternativies properly and timely.\n\n2 . Sample — Sample products to ensure integrity.\n\n3 . Last mile development/implementation — The last touch should be your company, locally, installing the software needed to run the hardware. This helps ensure trusted integrety.\n\n4 . On going review/non pattern review — You should maintain a strong relationship with the ODM, and you should have ongoing reviews of their processes, their suppliers, and how they check their suppliers. Inspections and reviews should be randomized, as to not create a predictable pattern. This helps maintain integrety and trust of the ODM.\n\n5 . Documentation/guidelines — You should document eveything. Ensure your processes are documented and followed. Ensure you follow industry guidelines for security and integrity.\n\nYou are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nEducation — The one thing that can help people understand and be prepared is education. The more people know, the more aware they become. It’s a simple idea that isn’t anything unique, but can become the most powerful thing on the planet.\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\n\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbycornwell/), SonicWall News (https://www.sonicwall.com/about-sonicwall/news/press-releases/)"
