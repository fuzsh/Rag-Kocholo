        "text": "Overview:\n\nWhether youâ€™re protecting a small business, a distributed enterprise, multiple businesses, or a closed network, your network security can get overwhelmed by operational disarrays, unseen risks and regulatory demands. Historically, efficient firewall management practices have mostly relied on dependable systems and operation control measures. However, frequent errors, misconfigurations and perhaps even violations of those controls remain constant challenges for well-run Security Operation Centers (SOCs).\n\nSonicWall Network Security Manager (NSM), a multi-tenant centralized firewall manager, allows you to centrally manage all firewall operations error-free by adhering to auditable workflows. Reporting and Analytics give single-pane visibility and let you monitor and uncover threats by unifying and correlating logs across all firewalls. NSM also helps you stay compliant as it allows for consistent policy enforcement across firewalls and provides detailed audit trails of every configuration change and granular reporting. The solution scales to any size organization that manages networks with hundreds of firewall devices deployed across multiple tenants or many locations. NSM does it all with less effort and time.\n\nCentrally Manage Your Firewalls"
