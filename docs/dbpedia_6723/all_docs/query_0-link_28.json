        "text": "Customer Success Manager: Provides enterprise environments with a dedicated trusted advisor. Your Customer Success Manager (CSM) acts on your behalf and works with your staff to help minimize unplanned downtime, optimize IT processes, provide operational reports to drive efficiencies and is your single point of accountability for a seamless support experience.\n\nFocused Technical Support (FTS): Provides a named engineering resource to support your enterprise account. Your FTS will know and understand your environment, policies and IT objectives to bring you fast technical resolution when you need support.\n\nSonicWall warranty and support agreements provide technical assistance during standard coverage hours, typically 24×7. A SonicWall technical specialist will work remotely with you to diagnose and identify software and hardware not performing to documented specifications. Support also includes general assistance regarding use and implementation on a limited basis. SonicWall’s warranty and support offerings do not include step-by-step installation or configuration of products or services. If you need installation or configuration assistance, SonicWall will refer you to a certified value-added reseller or offer you one of our Professional Services.\n\nWarranty and support agreements provide for replacement of failing hardware returned to a SonicWall factory. The replacement product may be new, or like-new. In the event of product obsolescence, SonicWall reserves the right to replace failing product with a product of like or better features and functionality.\n\nContact SonicWall Customer Support Center if you think you have a hardware problem. The support specialist will log your case and determine with you whether a replacement unit is required. If so, you will be provided with a Returned Material Authorization (RMA) number for your reference. SonicWall will ship you a replacement unit via pre-paid, next business day airfreight to the address that you specify. Routine RMA orders are filled on the day that they are received if the RMA is processed before 12:00 p.m. PST (1:00 p.m. GMT in Europe). You may be asked to provide a credit card number or billing authorization to secure the return of the defective unit to SonicWall. In Europe, an RMA Purchase Order form can be used instead of a credit card. In certain regions or countries, RMA Services are facilitated via certified SonicWall resellers or partners.\n\nSonicWall will automatically transfer the registration information and subscription services to the replacement unit. The replacement unit will include instructions for returning the defective unit to SonicWall. Shipping is paid by SonicWall. Please make sure that the RMA number is included with your shipment and that you return the defective unit to SonicWall within 30 days. After 30 days you will be billed the retail price of the new unit.\n\nSonicWall requires continuous coverage for support agreements. Appliances with an expired warranty or support agreement are considered to be “out of support compliance.” Support Services Reinstatement provides the opportunity to bring these appliances back into compliance and up to date. Generally, new agreements are retroactively activated to the expiration date of the most recent support agreement.\n\nCustomers with appliances that have an expired support agreement who purchase SonicWall Support Services Reinstatement and a new one-, two- or three-year support agreement receive a full 12/24/36 months of support from date of activation. Also included in SonicWall Support Services Reinstatement is a single firmware update, allowing you access to the most current firmware features.\n\nSonicWall will provide telephone and web-based support (via email) for active security services regardless of the appliance upon which the subscription is activated. Support for security services requires an active support contract for the appliance on which the service is running.\n\nSupport and updates/upgrades for SonicWall Global Management System (GMS) require a valid GMS support agreement, regardless of the appliance(s) that GMS is used to manage.\n\nGeneration 1, 2, 3 and 4 SonicWall appliances are not eligible to be registered.\n\n8 a.m. – 5 p.m. local time is defined as follows: In North America: 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time (MST). In Latin America: 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. Local Standard Time in the country where the product is deployed. In Europe, Middle East and Africa: 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. GMT +1 In Asia Pacific: 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. Local Standard Time in the country where the product is deployed. In Japan: 5 p.m. – 2 a.m. UTC/GMT\n\nVirtualization is a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources from the way in which other systems, applications or end users interact with those resources. It is able to make a single physical resource, such as a server, operating system, application or storage device, appear to function as multiple logical devices. It can also make multiple physical resources such as storage devices or servers appear as a single logical resource.\n\nAs a result, virtualization enables IT departments to increase the utilization of resources, increase high availability, and simplify back-up, systems administration and recovery procedures. It also allows IT departments to be more responsive to the dynamic needs of the business. Examples of virtualization technologies include VMware ESX® Server, Citrix/XenServer® and Microsoft® Windows Server® 2008 Hyper-V®.\n\nOur products leverage the binary compatibility offered through virtualization technologies, which provide complete transparency to the operating systems and applications deployed. As a result, for all casework received where SonicWall® software products are being used in a virtual environment, we will assume that the problem is common to both native and virtual operating environments, and we will only require the customer to recreate the problem in a native environment if and when there is reason to believe that the problem is unique to the virtual environment itself.\n\nFrom a purely functional perspective, our products will operate in exactly the same way as in a native environment, however we can make no guarantees with respect to performance or scalability in a virtualization environment running multiple virtual instances. Configuration aspects such as CPU, memory availability, I/O subsystem and network infrastructure can all influence such a deployment, and should be given careful consideration to ensure the virtual layer has the necessary resources available to provide a satisfactory user experience.\n\nWe are committed to providing products which work on the latest platforms and technologies available in the industry today. We work closely with technology vendors to ensure earliest possible compatibility with our solutions. We provide full details of all systems requirements, together with platform and third-party product versions supported with our products, in the Release Notes published for each product. These include operating system versions, service pack levels, mail clients or server versions, database versions, browsers and other related technology that we support, and at the version level that our products have been formally tested and certified to run against.\n\nThe support of future platform versions, new service packs and other related technologies will be taken into consideration and addressed during the regular product maintenance and release cycles of our products. This provides ongoing upward compatibility of our products as used in customer environments. It should be noted, therefore, that there could be a delay between the availability of the latest platform technology release or service patch, and the product version certified to operate with our products. Please contact Support should you have any questions with regards to the current support status of any product and a particular related platform, patch or third-party product support not explicitly documented in our release notes.\n\nFor more information about the latest third-party platforms and versions we support, please review the System Requirements section of the release notes for your product or search our Knowledge Base on the Support Portal. Please note that while we do not directly or officially support third-party software, we work closely with many providers to ensure that our customers receive the best possible service at all times."
