        "text": "Power options to minimise cost and complexity\n\nTo reduce the cost and complexity of connecting high-speed wireless access points and other Power over Ethernet (PoE)-enabled devices such as IP cameras, phones and printers, the TZ300P and TZ600P provide PoE/PoE+ power.\n\nAdvanced threat prevention to safeguard your business\n\nSonicWall’s mission is to secure networks in today’s dynamic and constantly-evolving cyber threat landscape. This involves a process of automated, real-time threat detection and prevention.\n\nThrough a combination of cloud-based and on-box technologies, SonicWall deliver protection to their firewalls that’s been validated by independent third-party testing for its extremely high security effectiveness.\n\nUnknown threats are sent to SonicWall’s cloud-based Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) multi-engine sandbox for analysis. Enhancing Capture ATP is SonicWall’s patent-pending Real-Time Deep Memory Inspection (RTDMI™) technology.\n\nReal-Time Deep Memory Inspection technology\n\nThe RTDMI engine detects and blocks malware and zero-day threats by inspecting directly in memory. RTDMI technology is precise, minimises false positives, and identifies and mitigates sophisticated attacks where the malware’s weaponry is exposed for less than 100 nanoseconds.\n\nWhat’s more, SonicWall’s patented single-pass Reassembly-Free Deep Packet Inspection (RFDPI) engine examines every byte of every packet, inspecting both inbound and outbound traffic directly on the firewall.\n\nBy leveraging Capture ATP with RTDMI technology in the SonicWall Capture Cloud Platform in addition to on-box capabilities including intrusion prevention, anti-malware and Web/URL filtering, the SonicWall TZ firewall series stops malware, ransomware and other threats at the gateway.\n\nAdditional protection for mobile devices\n\nFor mobile devices used outside your firewall perimeter, SonicWall Capture Client provides an additional layer of protection by applying advanced threat protection techniques such as machine learning and system rollback.\n\nCapture Client also leverages the deep inspection of encrypted TLS traffic (DPI-SSL) on TZ series firewalls by installing and managing trusted TLS certificates.\n\nTZ series firewalls are easy to set up and manage\n\nThe SonicWall TZ firewall series makes it easy to configure and manage firewalls, as well as the SonicWave 802.11ac Wave 2 access points, no matter where you deploy them.\n\nCentralised management, reporting, licensing and analytics are handled through SonicWall’s cloud-based Capture Security Center. This offers the ultimate in visibility, agility and capacity to centrally govern the entire SonicWall security ecosystem from a single pane of glass.\n\nA key component of the Capture Security Center is Zero-Touch Deployment. This is a cloud-based feature that will simplify and quicken the deployment and provisioning of SonicWall firewalls at remote and branch office locations. The process requires minimal user intervention. It is fully automated to operationalise firewalls at scale in just a few steps. This significantly reduces the time, cost and complexity associated with installation and configuration.\n\nTogether, the simplified deployment and setup along with the ease of management will enable your organisation to reduce total cost of ownership and realise a higher return on investment.\n\nIntroducing SonicWall Capture Cloud Platform\n\nSonicWall’s Capture Cloud Platform delivers cloud-based threat prevention and network management. It also provides reporting and analytics for organisations of all sizes. The platform consolidates threat intelligence gathered from multiple sources including SonicWall’s award-winning multi-engine network sandboxing service, Capture Advanced Threat Protection, plus more than 1 million SonicWall sensors located around the globe."
