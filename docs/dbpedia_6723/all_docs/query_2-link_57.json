        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nSonicWall announced that 2021 was its best year on record. Propelled by the delivery of high-demand products, including the evolution of its Generation 7 next-generation firewalls and a laser focus on its customers, SonicWall delivered record levels of sales and profitability in 2021.\n\n“An unwavering commitment to SonicWall customers has had a major impact on the last 12 months of business,” said SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner. “We have more than 17,000 active SonicWall partners helping protect our customers every day, and those same partners have increased market share in key price bands and market segments, confirming SonicWall’s place as one of the unquestioned leaders in the cybersecurity space.”\n\nDespite a difficult economic climate, the company posted strong financial results strengthening its pipeline growth, including a 33% increase in new customer growth and generating a 45% increase in new customer sales. Additionally, SonicWall has seen incredible growth in cloud-delivered products and services, which are up 36% year-over-year. Plus, new Generation 7 products have represented 90% of sales over the past year.\n\nOverall a Double-digit growth in revenue in India. Witnessed a big jump in Enterprise sales in last 2 years during the COVID period.\n\nMore than 17,000 channel partners worldwide and over 2500 partners within India region . Increased revenue contribution specially from SonicWall’s SF Metal partners\n\nBoundless 2022: The Benchmark of Partner Enablement\n\nCreated and produced exclusively for SonicWall partners, Boundless 2022 — the company’s global virtual partner experience — provided unparalleled content, insight and expert analysis to help partners succeed in 2022 and beyond. The attendance for the event was up 16% to the previous years, with over 47,000 live reactions throughout the content.\n\nAt Boundless 2022, SonicWall applauded its partners for the following successes in 2021:\n\nDouble-digit growth across all customer segments, from SMBs to enterprise and government customers\n\nOver 90% customer retention rate\n\n10% increase in partner annual recurring revenue\n\n34% growth in new customer unit volume, with a 40% increase in per-transaction value\n\n24% increase in the creation of new deal registrations\n\n“No question we had a record-setting year,” said SonicWall Chief Revenue Officer Bob VanKirk. “What’s equally important is that 2021 was a record-setting year for many of our partners. We continue to be completely committed to our channel and our go-to-market model, welcoming over 5,000 new partners last year alone due to SonicWall’s momentum and strong value proposition.”\n\n“The past year was an important chapter in our journey, especially in the creation of numerous and successful product generations while navigating the fast-moving global threat landscape,” said Debasish Mukherjee, Vice President, Regional Sales-APAC at SonicWall. “Our mission to provide technology that is as affordable and effective, still remains unchanged today – and we will continue to stay one step ahead to safeguard the needs of our customers, partners and growing networks across the 215 countries and territories.”\n\nSonicWall partners who missed the live Boundless 2022 event may still visit boundless2022.com to watch the on-demand content.\n\nCapture ATP Earns Four Consecutive ‘Perfect Scores’\n\nThe SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) service, which includes patented Real-Time Deep Memory InspectionTM (RTDMI) technology to catch the most advanced and unknown malware faster, was the only solution to receive four consecutive perfect scores in ICSA Labs Advanced Threat Defense (ATD) certification testing across the last four quarters. ICSA Labs is an independent third party that tested SonicWall’s solutions using never-before-seen malware samples.\n\nDuring 128 total days of testing in 2021, SonicWall detected 2,578 (100%) malicious samples of new and little-known threats, while weeding through 3,010 innocuous apps without issuing a single false positive — the only vendor in the security industry that can make that claim.\n\nThe ICSA Labs ATD test is unique in that it uses never-before-seen malware samples not found in any of the well-known third-party malware reputation services. Additionally, some malware samples are custom-modified by ICSA Labs, thus making them completely unique to the ICSA ATD test environment.\n\nThe conditions make it virtually a certainty that in order for a malware detection solution to produce a high score on such tests, it would have to have a superior dynamic analysis capability that’s accurate at identifying malware while ignoring truly benign samples.\n\n“The past year was an important chapter in our journey, especially in the creation of numerous and successful product generations while navigating the fast-moving global threat landscape,” said Debasish Mukherjee, Vice President, Regional Sales-APAC at SonicWall. “Our mission to provide technology that is as affordable and effective, still remains unchanged today – and we will continue to stay one step ahead to safeguard the needs of our customers, partners and growing networks across the 215 countries and territories.”\n\nSonicWall Excellence Recognized with Industry Accolades\n\nSonicWall has been recognized consistently by cybersecurity industry experts over the last several months for the quality of its programs and the prominence of its partner program and employees.\n\nOn its most recent analysis of the global network firewall market, Frost & Sullivan awarded SonicWall with its 2021 Global Competitive Strategy Leadership Award. Frost & Sullivan applies a rigorous analytical process to evaluate multiple nominees for each award category before determining the final award recipient.\n\nIn addition, SonicWall was named as one of the 20 Coolest Network Security Companies of 2022 in CRN’s coveted Security 100. CRN’s Security 100 examines 100 vendors across five market segments to guide solution providers on where to place their bets in a crowded market.\n\nCRN also spotlighted SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner in the 2022 CEO Outlook, while also recognizing three SonicWall channel team leaders as 2022 CRN Channel Chiefs: Bob VanKirk, HoJin Kim and David Bankemper."
