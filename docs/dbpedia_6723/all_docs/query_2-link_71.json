        "text": "Supplier Profile: Why We Recommend SonicWall Products\n\nAs experts in cybersecurity, we highly recommend SonicWall and their ever-expanding suite of enterprise-level network security products.\n\nRegardless of what your company does, how you operate, and your relationship with IT, chances are there’s a SonicWall product out there that will provide enviable protection for your entire network.\n\nBut who are SonicWall? What products do they offer? And why do our boffins rate them so highly? Let’s find out.\n\n[Side note: If you’re a WatchGuard user – read our WatchGuard Supplier Profile]\n\nWho are SonicWall?\n\nSonicWall are a well-respected provider of network security solutions, currently headquartered in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe firm was initially founded in 1991 as Sonic Systems, developing network hardware for Apple PCs. In the late 90s, the company released a dedicated firewall and VPN solution for small businesses called SonicWALL.\n\nAs sales of their network security products skyrocketed, they ended the Apple hardware side of the business to focus on network security exclusively. In 1999, the company changed its name to SonicWall Inc.\n\nThroughout the noughties, SonicWall Inc. went from strength to strength through numerous mergers and acquisitions, and was a subdivision of Dell Computers from 2012 to 2016.\n\nThe company has developed into a network security powerhouse, employing around 1,600 people as of April 2020.\n\nTheir product range has grown in leaps and bounds since their initial firewall/VPN offering, now providing a vast range of up-to-the-minute IT security solutions to combat the increasingly complex cyber threat landscape.\n\nAll in all, SonicWall products provide reliable comprehensive IT security and control to companies of all kinds around the world.\n\nWhat Products Do SonicWall Provide?\n\nSonicWall’s range is far-reaching, but can be boiled down to the following basic categories:\n\nFirewalls\n\nSonicWall provide numerous industry-leading firewall solutions, with something in their catalogue to suit numerous different needs and use cases. Regardless of company size, function, or distribution, SonicWall will likely have a firewall to keep your whole team safe online.\n\nRecent SonicWall firewall solutions are seamlessly compatible with their top-notch sandboxing, content filtering, and intrusion prevention services.\n\nSecure Wireless Access Points\n\nThe company’s SonicWave range of secure Wi-Fi access point hardware is designed to prevent wireless snooping, data theft, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These controls are all managed through a convenient cloud-based interface, enabling fast, secure, and reliable wireless network access throughout your premises.\n\nCloud Firewall Options\n\nAn ever-increasing number of companies rely on public cloud services like Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft Azure. With SonicWall’s powerful cloud firewall solutions, you can enjoy top notch security across all of your cloud environments and SaaS systems.\n\nContent Filtering\n\nIf many of your team work from home or spend a lot of time on the road, they’ll naturally spend time on networks that aren’t under your direct control.\n\nIn order to keep your IT estate secure when away from the confines of your network, you’ll naturally need the ability to block unproductive, objectionable, or non-secure content.\n\nSonicWall’s Content Filtering Client (CFC) references SonicWall’s massive cloud-based database of URLs to help your administrators identify and filter out content you’d rather your workforce avoid.\n\nVPNs and Remote Access Security\n\nRemote working has tons of benefits to morale, but can come with some hefty cyber security downsides. However, with a little help from SonicWall’s standalone remote access security and VPN products, companies needn’t put themselves at risk when providing remote working options.\n\nWhy Do Just Firewalls Recommend SonicWall\n\nSo, it’s time for the million-dollar question – why do the team at Just Firewalls endorse SonicWall’s products?\n\nLet’s shine a light on some of our favourite SonicWall features.\n\nMore Than Mere Hardware: Advanced Gateway Security Suite\n\nWe feel that SonicWall really goes above and beyond with their Advanced Gateway Security Suite (AGSS). It’s a suite of tools that are absolutely invaluable if you have one of their TZ, NSa, NSsp, NSv, or SuperMassive firewalls.\n\n[See all the AGSS licences available for your SonicWall model]\n\nAGSS is a is a comprehensive network security package that includes subscriptions to numerous SonicWall network security tools, including:\n\n● Gateway antivirus and anti-spyware tools\n\n● A cutting-edge Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)\n\n● Content filtering and policy enforcement functions\n\n● Cloud-enriched sandboxing through the Capture ATP platform\n\nEach of these tools are invaluable on their own, but together they form a formidable suite of protection.\n\nWe feel that IPS systems are particularly important; important enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with antivirus and firewall solutions. IPS tools take a top-down view of your network’s traffic, scanning in-motion traffic for known vulnerabilities, as well as identifying and potentially stopping suspicious traffic patterns.\n\nSandboxing tools are also well worth the investment. A lot of online threat detection is quite reactive; a threat is found, a solution is engineered, and that solution is deployed.\n\nHowever, what happens to those threats that stay under the radar, or those that don’t have a fix yet? These are called zero-day threats.\n\nSandboxing tools test suspicious files out in a separate PC-like environment to ensure that they’re safe – relying on their own findings rather than referencing databases of known threats.\n\nSonicWall’s sandboxing tool, Capture ATP, opens each unknown inbound file in multiple isolated, virtual environments to see if the files do anything unexpected. And because it’s linked to a global database of known files, it can immediately approve or deny files that have already been tested elsewhere.\n\nReassembly-Free, Stream-Based Deep Packet Inspection\n\nWe’ve discussed deep packet inspection previously on the blog – it’s a funky firewall feature that continually scans all incoming data packets in depth, reassembles what it can of the files being downloaded, and inspects that for threats. SonicWall goes one step further – all recent-generation SonicWall firewalls feature Reassembly-Free Deep Packet Inspection (RFDPI).\n\nOlder DPI systems are continually auditing packets, trying to put them together, and assessing their security all at once. At times of heavy system load, it’s common for some files to bypass scanning. Some DPI systems also have limits on file sizes, so larger files may not be checked at all.\n\nRFDPI, however, doesn’t memorise or reassemble anything, enabling for a deeper scan, a quicker result, and a higher throughput. Instead, it scans a continuous stream of traffic coming in, meaning there are no limits on file sizes or number of users under its protection at any given time.\n\nGranular Web Application Firewalling Control\n\nBrowser-based web applications, like SaaS solutions or social media platforms, are invaluable to many businesses, though they also come with their own security risks. Because they’re constantly talking to the open internet, cybercriminals can hijack this connection and potentially interfere with traffic, steal data, or infiltrate the network.\n\nSonicWall’s SMA100 Series Web Application Firewall (WAF) uses threat data collected from global cybersecurity databases to dynamically identify and stop incoming potential web application attacks, including SQL injections, unauthorised access, and DoS attempts. SMA100 also provides in-depth historical analytics about inbound threats and hacking attempts.\n\nProtection In and Out of the Office\n\nSonicWall recognise that work doesn’t just get done behind the safety of an on-premises firewall. More and more organisations are implementing remote working policies, and personnel are increasingly relying on their own “BYOD” devices for work projects.\n\nTeams may even work totally remotely across continents! As networks are moving toward more mobile, hybrid infrastructures, IT security platforms need to keep up.\n\nSonicWall’s Secure Mobile Access (SMA) provides authenticated users with a secure, seamless link in to network resources or cloud functions, regardless of what network they’re connected to. It also features granular policy control functions and comprehensive reporting functions.\n\nHonourable Mention: SonicWall’s Annual Cyber Threat Report\n\nEvery year, we always keep an eye out for SonicWall’s annual Cyber Threat Report. It’s an easy to read summary of the previous year’s cybercrime data, including trends, emerging risks, and advancements in network security technology. Why not grab your copy of 2020’s report here?\n\nReady to find out what SonicWall products can bring to your business?
