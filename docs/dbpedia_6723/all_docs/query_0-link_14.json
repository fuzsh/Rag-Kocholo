        "text": "Gateway Anti-virus and Anti-spyware\n\nLeverage the gateway anti-virus and anti-spyware service to protect your organization from the latest global threats, including blended threats that originate from multiple sources, operate at multiple layers and utilize multiple protocols. Guard against Trojans, spyware, viruses and other malware threats by inspecting all email file attachments, ftp downloads and real-time applications such as IM and P2P for total, file-based threat control.\n\nBecause the gateway anti-virus and anti-spyware service works in conjunction with SonicWall firewalls, you can ensure that all files Â— regardless of file size or compression Â— are analyzed in real time, and that administrators receive proactive alerts whenever a threat is detected. The service also enables you to prevent day-zero attacks with dynamically updated databases and an extensive list of virus and malware signatures. And, because all threats are blocked at the gateway, your end users are prevented from downloading malware in the first place. In addition, the gateway anti-virus and anti-spyware service gives you the power to prevent auto-installation of ActiveX components and stop spyware programs from communicating with their hosts.\n\nIntrusion Prevention\n\nUse the intrusion prevention service (IPS) engine of Gateway Security Services to scan all network traffic for worms, Trojans, software vulnerabilities, backdoor exploits and other types of malicious attacks. The IPS engine leverages a comprehensive signature database, so you can protect your organization against an array of network-based application vulnerabilities and exploits, and guard against internal and external threats by monitoring the network for malicious or anomalous traffic, and blocking or logging traffic based on predefined and automatically updated conditions. By focusing on known malicious traffic, the SonicWall intrusion prevention service helps you to decrease false positives while increasing network reliability and performance.\n\nApplication Intelligence and Control\n\nThe SonicWall application intelligence and control feature provides granular control and real-time visualization of applications, so you can guarantee bandwidth prioritization and ensure maximum network security and productivity. Because it is tightly integrated with SonicWall next-generation firewalls, it uses the SonicWall RFDPI engine to identify and control applications, regardless of port or protocol. Its signature database to scans more than 2,800 applications and millions of malware threats, allowing you to maintain granular control over your applications, prioritize or throttle bandwidth and deny website access. An Application Flow Monitor provides real-time graphs of applications, ingress and egress bandwidth, active website connections and user activity so you can monitor and control network use."
