        "text": "Overview:\n\nWhen you are facing multiple threats from multiple locations, you need multiple layers of protection. A firewallâ€™s gateway anti-virus solution provides the first layer of defense at the perimeter, stopping most attacks before they enter the network. But viruses can still enter the network through multiple entry points. While protection at multiple layers is the best defense, deploying, maintaining and enforcing the right security software on the endpoint devices can strain IT resources and budgets. This has created the need for a manageable, enforced network-wide solution that ensures all endpoints have the latest security software updates.\n\nSonicWall firewalls provide an innovative multi-layered anti-malware strategy consisting of its proprietary Reassembly Free Deep Packet Inspection (RFDPI) anti-malware solution at the gateway and enforced anti-virus solution at the endpoints. When a non-complaint endpoint within the network tries to connect to the Internet, the firewall will redirect the user to a web page to install the latest SonicWall Enforced Client Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware software. The firewall further ensures that all the endpoint clients are automatically updated with the latest anti-virus and anti-spyware signatures without end-user intervention. The software is easily deployed, automatically enforced and updated network-wide on Microsoft Windows devices through a powerful but easy-to-use policy-driven engine. Because it is client-based and maintained across the network, it protects against threats regardless of whether the endpoint is inside the corporate network or outside connected via VPN. Virus and spyware signatures are updated automatically, thus simplifying ongoing administration and ensuring reliability. SonicWall Enforced Client AntiVirus and Anti-Spyware software is available for purchase with the McAfee or Kaspersky anti-virus engine.\n\nBenefits"
