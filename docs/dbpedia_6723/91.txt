SonicWALL Anti-Spyware is part of the SonicWALL Gateway Anti-Virus, Anti-Virus and Intrusion Prevention Service solution that provides comprehensive, real-time protection against viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and software vulnerabilities.

The SonicWALL Anti-Spyware Service protects networks from intrusive spyware by cutting off spyware installations and delivery at the gateway and denying previously installed spyware from communicating collected information outbound. SonicWALL Anti-Spyware works with other anti-spyware program, such as programs that remove existing spyware applications from hosts. You are encouraged to use or install host-based anti-spyware software as an added measure of defense against spyware.

SonicWALL Anti-Spyware analyzes inbound connections for the most common method of spyware delivery, ActiveX-based component installations. It also examines inbound setup executables and cabinet files crossing the gateway, and resets the connections that are streaming spyware setup files to the LAN. These file packages may be freeware bundled with adware, keyloggers, or other spyware. If spyware has been installed on a LAN workstation prior to the SonicWALL Anti-Spyware solution install, the service will examine outbound traffic for streams originating at spyware infected clients and reset those connections. For example, when spyware has been profiling a user's browsing habits and attempts to send the profile information home, the SonicWALL security appliance identifies that traffic and resets the connection.

The SonicWALL Anti-Spyware Service provides the following protection:
