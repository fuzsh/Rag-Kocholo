I was kind of glad he picked up 2 fouls in the 1st quarter, otherwise Ray Allen would've put up about 30... IN THE FIRST QUARTER.\n\nSo, is he slipping? Or is he on the way out, and maybe knows it? He just didnt look at all inspired to be playing the number 1 team in the NBA last night. I realize they were without Garnett, but we surely didnt have Devin.\n\nI realize it was one game, and I try not to knee-jerk (unless its about Avery's inabilities, but thats a thread I'll hold off on for now), but he doesnt seem the same player anymore. Maybe its the 6th or 7th label. maybe its age, but he does not look good. I realize at some point next week he'll shoot himself to 27 points and everyone will be happy with him. But his defensive inabilities are at their worst ever, and I dont think they will improve.\n\nMagette anyone?",

I've been one of his biggest supporters, although I never believed he should be getting a ton of opportunities over Devin. I love his ability to take and make big shots. I love his personality and the intangibles he brings to the team. I have a hard time even imagining this team without him.\n\nBut I think the team would be better off turning Jet into a better asset or a better fit. It's got to be better though - that's why I didn't like so many of the trade scenarios this summer.\n\nJet is not the best point guard on the team. It's my opinion that he hasn't been in some time. And while he may be the best shooting guard on the team, his lack of size and strength really hurts. Out of all of the regular rotation players, I think Jet's defense is probably the worst too (it's he or Bass).\n\nAnd sometimes, like last night, all I can remember is watching him struggle to dribble against Golden State, missing long jumpers, and getting burned on the other end of the floor too.\n\nI can't hardly imagine the team without him, but I wonder if he's not part of the problem?\n\nI made this post under \"Master System\" thread but i think it is more applicable here:\n\nThat is because Jet can't handle the ball well enough to create a shot for himself or go around defenders without having the ball stolen. Hell last night he couldn't even make a decent pass in the final 3 minutes.\n\nIf Terry gets a good screen he can make a shot from anywhere. If he is open he can make a shot from anywhere and if there is a guy in his face he can sometimes make it. But make no mistake, he can not create his own shot.\n\nand i will tell you who Jason Terry sort of reminds me of.........Michael Finley 3 years ago. He could make an open shot but he no longer had the ball handling skills or quickness to get around defenders. He can hit the open jumper but that was about it. I don't think Terry is quite to that point yet, but he might not be far from that point.\n\n__________________\n\nDallas Mavericks 2011 NBA Champions\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by 41times\n\nI made this post under \"Master System\" thread but i think it is more applicable here:\n\nThat is because Jet can't handle the ball well enough to create a shot for himself or go around defenders without having the ball stolen.

Kinda looked like he was dribbling with a stick up his a$$. Well, Terry is a mirror image of that. Hell, if I was the Celtics, I would've waited for Terry to cross midcourt, and trap him all night long. How does a guy get labeled a point guard, or even combo guard, and have NO vision?\n\n***************************\n\nOk, now bear with me for one moment.... Do you think NJ would be crazy enough to take Jet, and the other filler for Kidd, and we can play kidd and devin together?\n\nI know I will get crucified for this, but it could work, and work well. Have Devin and Kidd both run point, you basically have an extra creator on the floor. Both can get to the basket, and are zone killers. I know Kidds shot is suspect sometimes, but I'm pretty sure he could hit them if he was wide open, or find someone who could. And defensively, Devin could guard the quicker of the other teams guards, and Kidd could guard the larger. For example, if we were to play golden state, kidd would guard davis, devin on ellis. Make sense so far? If we play the spurs, devin on parker, kidd on fin/barry/manu. Suns we got devin on nash, kidd on bell, etc. I know Kidd is older, but I think he's got some good d left in the tank if he's inspired.\n\nOk, tear that to shreads. I dont know who would have to be packaged to make it work, but I bet we could give them Terry and a pick, and some filler. I know this leaves us a little thinner on the bench, but its worth discussing. And remember, I am no way in favor of giving Devin for Kidd.\n\n__________________\n\nHe who laughs last, thinks slowest. I've been saying for a year that JET is totally redundant here and is probably untradable. I'm totally done with him. I'd cut him and his contract if I could. To me, he's not an asset. JET contributes about 15 minutes every 5 games, getting that 25 points to carry his \"love\" over. The rest of the time he gets abused by the opposition, he can't play point (can't pass, dribble, create anything), he can't play the 2. Yes, he can shoot and gets his points (not always efficiently) but he's a liability, nonetheless. That's where that PER really kills me. It's way off for JET. I'm like DDH in that I can't see the team without him, except to me, that's a very bad thing. I'm behind most deals that send him out. I do think Kidd could work with Devin but it makes us even more unconventional (our front court is very different from most teams already), if that's a bad thing. I'm hoping Devin's absence wakes Avery out of his JET-coma. Stack at least cares and puts an effort in. It kills me that we have about $20M/year at back-up 2 (long term even) (JET, Stack, Hassell, Ager) and it's BY FAR our weakest spot, and if we don't win a championship, it'll be because we were killed there like the last 2 series (couldn't stop and couldn't produce). God, if we could put that money to good use, we'd be killers.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by CrystalBalls\n\nI agree that Kidd & Devin could be quite effective. I'm not sure that's better than a conventional 2 when you throw in Kidd's baggage and contract. It's sure better than what we have now though. I'm not sure I'd do your upgrade at this time, but I'd consider it. We'd need to pick up 3 guys and NJ would need to buy out 3 guys. That would be interesting and expensive for both teams.\n\nAnd Jason Kidd isn't the only option. I just think he would help this team, but not at the price that's being talked about.\n\nIf Jason Kidd isn't doable without gutting the team, I think there could still be some other deals out there that would help this team. In fact, I would be on the phone right now with the Clippers talking about Maggette and Cassell.\n\nSee, more and more I'm getting concerned with the backup point guard play. It's not just that Jet is a liability at the two; he's worrying me at the point more than before. Maybe he just had a couple of bad games though....I hope.\n\nBut I would be interested in finding a way to turn Jet into a legit two guard and backup point guard who can help run this team.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by ddh33\n\nI love Jet.

When I saw him being pressured, the mavs not getting into their sets and tossing up junk 3's I had flashbacks to GS as well. The bad thing is that the best offense when jet is there is to have the dirk/jet p&r, but that means that dirk won't be able to post up anyone. It just cannot stand, I believe that avery made a mistake not playing JJB as the backup point, no matter his issues.\n\nBut Avery makes quite a few mistakes in in-game situations unfortunately."
