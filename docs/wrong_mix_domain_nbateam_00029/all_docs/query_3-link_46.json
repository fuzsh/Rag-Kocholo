        "text": "NJAM\n\nBy Steve Politi | NJ Advance Media\n\nUPDATED -- 6/21. We had so much feedback on the list that we decided to take another swing at the ranking, added several players that readers rightly said were missing. It's still an imperfect list, but it's closer to the true ranking. Still disagree? Send along your thoughts.\n\nThe NBA might have deserted New Jersey a few years ago, but that doesn't mean the state has stopped producing many of its best players.\n\nSome of the legends of the sport have learned to play on our playgrounds and for our high school teams. Ranking them is, of course, virtually impossible. But we gave it a shot with the top baseball players in New Jersey history, so we'll do our best again.\n\nFirst, some ground rules. A player can qualify for this list in two ways:\n\n1. He was born here. Yes, Shaquille O'Neal moved away before he could play high school basketball in New Jersey, but we know what his birth certificate says: Newark.\n\n2. He grew up here or attended high school here. This is tricky, because several great players such as Luol Deng only stayed in New Jersey briefly. Still, if we included players who came to the state for college, it wouldn't really be a New Jersey list. And that's what we're gunning for with this project.\n\nHere is our list ...\n\n50. Jay Williams\n\nThe Plainfield native was a college superstar, leading Duke to a NCAA championship (2001) and winning the Naismith Player of the Year Award (2002). A motorcycle accident after his rookie season ended what could have been a brilliant NBA career.\n\n49. Mike O'Koren\n\nNJAM\n\nThe Hudson Catholic graduate went from one of the finest college teams at North Carolina to some woeful NBA teams in his home state, playing for the Nets from 1980-86. He averaged 8.2 points and 3.4 rebounds a game as pro.\n\nMore: The Nets never felt at home\n\nLooking back on their departure to Brooklyn.\n\n48. Bill Willoughby\n\nNJAM\n\nHe became the second youngest player to enter a game in NBA history when he first stepped on the court in 1975, but skipping college out of Dwight Morrow High in Englewood might not have been the best decision. He played on six teams over end seasons and was out of the NBA at 26.\n\n47. John Crotty\n\nAP Photo\n\nCrotty, who played at Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft, was undrafted out of the University of Virginia, but the 6-foot-1 point guard bounced around the NBA for 11 seasons before retiring in 2003. He finished with 999 career assists.\n\n46. Jason Thompson\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Lenape High graduate went from Rider University to the first round of the 2008 NBA Draft. He's played eight seasons in the NBA. Thompson spent this past season overseas playing for the Shandong Golden Stars in China's CBA.\n\n45. Gerald Govan\n\nABA Photo\n\nGovan, who grew up in Jersey City, has the distinction of being only one of six players who played in each of the ABA's nine seasons. The 6-10 rebounding specialist played in 681 games with the red-white-and-blue ball, fourth-most among players who never appeared in the NBA.\n\nAlso: N.J.'s 50 greatest baseball players\n\nDerek Jeter, Mike Trout and other stars top the list.\n\n44. Bill Melchionni\n\nAP Photo\n\nMelchionni, who starred at Bishop Eustace Prep in Pennsauken, was a reserve on the 1967 NBA champion 76ers before moving to the ABA, where he played seven years for the Nets. They retired his No. 25.\n\n43. Malik Allen\n\nAP Photo\n\nAllen, who played at Shawnee High in Medford, started 73 games for the 2002-03 Miami Heat in his second professional season. He never started more than 20 games in a season after that, but he played through 2011 before retiring.\n\nWhere is Dajuan Wagner now?\n\nCamden native now lives out of the spotlight\n\n42. Dajuan Wagner\n\nNJAM\n\nFew schoolboy players were more thrilling to watch than the Camden native, who scored 100 points in a game and led his public-school team to a state title. That flash of brilliance was enough to put him on this list even if his professional career is a series of what-ifs, with Wagner appearing in just 103 games after scoring 13.4 points a game as a rookie.\n\n41. Charlie Villanueva\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Blair Academy graduate played for 11 years in the NBA, most recently for the Dallas Mavericks in the 2015-16 season. His best season came in 2008-09, when he averaged 16.2 points and 6.7 rebounds a game for Milwaukee.\n\n40. Eric Murdock\n\nAP Photo\n\nMurdock, who starred at Bridgewater-Raritan High, played 508 games in his NBA career and averaged 10.1 points a game. Rutgers fans, however, will never forget his stint as part of the basketball staff, which led to the Mike Rice fiasco.\n\n39. Hank Finkel\n\nThe man who had the unenviable task of replacing Bill Russell on the Boston Celtics eventually became a fan favorite in the city. The 7-footer from Union City was part of the franchise's 1974 championship and played for nine seasons in the NBA.\n\nAlso: Murdock and the Rutgers scandal\n\nHe helped bring down an athletic department.\n\n38. Bob Verga\n\nNBA Photo\n\nVerga went from St. Rose High School in Belmar to Duke, where he set a scoring record, to the ABA in 1967. He averaged more than 27 points a game with the Carolina Cougars in the 1969-70 season, and then finished his career with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n37. Terry Dehere\n\nNJAM\n\nThe Jersey City native, who starred at St. Anthony High and then Seton Hall, went on to have a productive four-year NBA career. He appeared in more than 400 games, mostly with the Clippers, and averaged 8.2 points a game.\n\n36. Gerald Henderson Jr.\n\nAP Photo\n\nBorn in Caldwell, Henderson was the No. 12 overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. The son of a former NBA player, he's a key contributor with the Philadelphia 76ers now, averaging 9.2 points per game off the bench.\n\n35. Andrew Bynum\n\nAP Photo\n\nIt didn't end well for the big Plainsboro native, who the Los Angeles Lakers surprisingly made a first-round pick out of St. Joseph (Metuchen) in 2005. But he averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds a game, becoming one of the sport's most dominant big men before knee injuries destroyed his career.\n\nPlus: St. Anthony's closing ends an era\n\nHoops won't be the same in New Jersey.\n\n34. Lonnie Wright\n\nNJAM\n\nWright was arguably the greatest athlete Newark has ever produced. He was fifth on The Star-Ledger's list of the greatest N.J. athletes of the 20th Century, and had his focus been solely on basketball and not also a pro football career, there's no telling what he might have accomplished.\n\n33. Tony Campbell\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Teaneck High graduate played in the NBA from 1984-97 and won a championship with the Detroit Pistons in 1988. He finished six points shy of 8,000 for his career, and then became one of the top players for the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n32. Eric Williams\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Newark native's career began humbly at Burlington County College ended with 658 career games in the NBA. He was the 14th overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 1995 draft, playing for seven teams over 13 seasons.\n\n31. Dahntay Jones\n\nAP Photo\n\nJones, who grew up in Hamilton Square and played at Steinert High and (for two seasons) Rutgers, has carved out a 13-year career in the NBA. He isn't a star, but he has proven himself to be a valuable bench player on eight teams.\n\nMore: Why Rutgers hoops is going places\n\nSteve Pikiell's team showing signs of progress.\n\n30. Brian Taylor\n\nNBA Photo\n\nThe Perth Amboy native is a two-time ABA champion who successfully made the transition to the NBA, where he averaged a career-high 17 points a game for the Kansas City Kings in 1976. He retired with 7,868 career points.\n\n29. Chris Ford\n\nFord, who played at Holy Family Spirit High in Absecon, is better known as a head coach than as a player. Still, he won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 1981, and is credited for hitting the first 3-point shot in NBA history.\n\n28. Troy Murphy\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe 6-foot-11 forward, who grew up in Sparta and starred at nearby Delbarton before becoming a college star at Notre Dame, averaged a double-double in five of his 12 NBA seasons. He went back to school at Columbia after finishing his NBA career to get his degree.\n\n27. Rory Sparrow\n\nAP Photo\n\nSparrow, who starred at Eastside High in Paterson, had a productive 12-year career as a point guard in the NBA. He is also the answer to a trivia question: Who scored the first field goal in Miami Heat history?\n\nMore: N.J.'s 50 best NFL players\n\nFranco Harris, Joe Theisman and other stars.\n\n26. Billy Paultz\n\nThe River Dell High graduate started his long career in the ABA in 1970 with the New York Americans and finished it in 1985 with the Utah Jazz. The 6-foot-11 center, nicknamed the Whopper, is a member of the ABA All-Time team.\n\n25. Bobby Hurley\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Jersey City native became a college star at Duke, leading the Blue Devils to back-to-back NCAA titles as their floor general. A tragic car accident during his rookie year with the Sacramento Kings devastated his chances of having an elite professional career.\n\n24. Chris Gatling\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Elizabeth native, known for an ever-present headband after he suffered a serious head injury as a child, played for eight different teams during his 12-season career. He averaged 10.3 points and 5.3 rebounds.\n\n23. Roy Hinson\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Franklin native, who went onto become one of the greatest players in Rutgers basketball history, played in 507 NBA games and scored 7,206 points. He works for the NBA Players' Association as a regional representative.\n\nPlus: 50 best Rutgers athletes\n\nWhere does Roy Hinson rank?\n\n22. Randy Foye\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Newark native has appeared in 752 games in the NBA during his career, averaging 10.3 points and 2.8 assists. He has languished on some bad teams during his 12 years as a pro, including the woeful Brooklyn Nets last season.\n\n21. Cleo Hill\n\nNJAM\n\nWhile he only played in the NBA for one season, many believed that Hill -- one of the greatest basketball players in Newark history -- was reportedly blackballed by the 1961-62 St. Louis Hawks in order to let the star white players score more points.\n\n20. Kenneth Faried\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Newark native has emerged as strong rebounding forward during the first six years of his career, averaging 11.9 points and 8.5 rebounds a game. His backstory -- he was raised by a lesbian couple in the city -- became a compelling narrative after he was drafted in the first round in 2011.\n\n19. Mark Bryant\n\nThe Columbia High and Seton Hall graduate had a long and productive career in the NBA, one that started in 1988 with Portland and ended in 2003 in Boston. Along the way, he played in nearly 800 games and twice played in the NBA Finals.\n\n18. Sam Dalembert\n\nAP Photo\n\nDalembert's journey took him from Haiti to St. Patrick's of Elizabeth to Seton Hall and then anywhere in the NBA where a GM needed a big body. The 6-11 center averaged 7.8 rebounds a game during his career, and used those long arms to become one of the league's most effective shot blockers.\n\n17. Brevin Knight\n\nNJAM Photo\n\nThe 5-foot-10 guard was lightly recruited out of Seton Hall Prep, but he went onto have an outstanding career at Stanford before becoming a reliable ball handler in the NBA who averaged 7.3 points and 6.1 assists a game during a 13-year career.\n\nAlso: Willard deserves credit at SHU\n\nSeton Hall's hoops program is rising.\n\n16. Tim Thomas\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe 6-10 forward with a soft-shooting touch from Paterson never quite lived up to the lofty expectations when he arrived in the NBA, but he played for seven different teams during a productive 13-year NBA career.\n\n15. Luol Deng\n\nAP Photo\n\nDeng, a Sudanese who moved to New Jersey when he was 14 and enrolled at Blair Academy, is a two-time NBA All-Star entering his 14th season in the NBA. He is averaging 15.0 points and 6.1 rebounds a game.\n\nTowns: All you need to know\n\nFast facts on the former No. 1 pick.\n\n14. Karl-Anthony Towns\n\nAP Photo\n\nHow can we rank a player this high after just two seasons? Well, these have been two ridiculous seasons for the Piscataway native and St. Joseph's (Metuchen) star. The 2016 Rookie of the Year has started all of the 164 games in his career so far, and last season averaged 25.1 points and 12.3 rebounds for the Timberwolves. He's only getting better, too.\n\n13. Al Harrington\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Roselle native was never an All-Star in the NBA but he was, for stretches of his career, a prolific scorer. He averaged 20.7 points a game for the 2008-09 season with the Knicks, the best of his career on a bad New York team.\n\n12. J.R. Smith\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe Millstone native and St. Benedict's Prep (Newark) graduate has had his ups and downs during his NBA career, but was named the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 2013. His shirtless celebration after the Cavaliers won the 2016 championship -- with Smith starting all 21 playoff games -- became a big deal on social media.\n\n11. Nikos Galis\n\nAP\n\nGalis, a Union City native, had a brilliant career in Europe. He was one of the inaugural members of the FIBA Hall of Fame and, in 2017, the eight-time Greek League champion was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame.\n\n10. Mike Bibby\n\nAP Photo\n\nBibby, who was born in Cherry Hill before moving to California as a child, played in 1,001 NBA games and averaged 14.7 points. He started all 20 games for the Miami Heat during their 2011 playoff run that ended with a loss to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.\n\n9. Joakim Noah\n\nAP Photo\n\nNoah, who went from the Lawrenceville School to a two-time national champion at Florida, is a two-time NBA All-Star who was named the league's defensive player of the year in 2014. The Knicks might want a return on the four-year, $72 million contract they gave him, though.\n\nPlus: Ranking the NCAA mascots\n\nWhich crazy character tops our list?\n\n8. Kelly Tripucka\n\nNJAM Photo\n\nThe pride of Bloomfield carved out an impressive 10-year career in the NBA after playing collegiately for Notre Dame, scoring 12,142 points -- that's 17.2 a game -- while twice being chosen for the All-Star Game.\n\n7. David West\n\nAP Photo\n\nWest, a Teaneck native, has turned down millions in pursuit of the one thing he has lacked in his career: A championship ring. He is closing in on that with the Golden State Warriors now, where a player who averaged more than 20 points in back-to-back seasons has settled into a valuable bench presence.\n\n6. Al Attles\n\nThe Newark native and Weequahic High graduate earned the nickname as \"The Destroyer\" for his defensive talents while with the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors. He was the team's second-leading scorer on March 2, 1962, with 17 points. Wilt Chamberlain had 100. Attles is still an ambassador for the Golden State franchise.\n\n5. Kyrie Irving\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe West Orange native was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, and while he is just entering his prime, he has already earned his lofty spot on this list. Irving is a four-time All-Star who helped lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA title last summer, and two months later, Team USA to a gold medal in Rio.\n\nMore: Irving delivers on a dream\n\nHow he helped an 8-year-old kid.\n\n4. Dennis Rodman\n\nAP Photo\n\nThe flamboyant Rodman is a five-time NBA champion, a two-time defensive player of the year and arguably the greatest rebounder in the sport's history, averaging 13.1 rebounds a game during 14-year career. He was born in Trenton before moving to Dallas as a child.\n\n3. Tom Heinsohn\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame honoree was a part of eight NBA championships with the Boston Celtics as a player and two more as a coach. He was born in Jersey City and played at St. Michael's High School in Union City, and in 1957 was named NBA Rookie of the Year ... ahead of teammate Bill Russell.\n\n2. Rick Barry\n\nBarry, who was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1996, is the only player in basketball history to lead the NCAA, the ABA and the NBA in scoring for a single season. The Roselle Park native won a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 1975 and was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\n1. Shaquille O'Neal\n\nThis one is easy: The Newark native is one of the greatest centers in the history of the sport, a four-time NBA champion and a three-time NBA Finals MVP who scored 28,596 points in his career, more than all but seven players in league history. The 7-foot-1 star also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2).\n\nYour turn: Who did we miss?\n\nPutting a list together like this is an inexact science.
