        "text": "Greetings, Falcoholics! Summer is officially upon us, and that means football season is just around the corner. With football’s return comes the excitement of fantasy football. Since 2019, I’ve been predicting top sleepers from each NFL team to help you dominate your fantasy league drafts. You can revisit my picks from 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and2023 articles by clicking the respective years.\n\nNow, before diving into the 2024 sleeper list, let’s review the criteria. Each player chosen offers significant potential value for your fantasy team, based on points-per-reception (PPR) scoring format. While some names may be familiar, their average draft position (ADP) indicates they offer great value.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump in!\n\nArizona Cardinals — Trey Benson\n\nRB Keaontay Ingram, (2023), WR Rondale Moore (2022), RB Chase Edmonds (2021), WR Andy Isabella (2020), QB Kyler Murray (2019)\n\nBenson has the potential to emerge as a standout by the end of the season, even with the presence of the still-formidable James Conner. While Conner has struggled to play more than 13 games in a season over the last two years, Benson’s opportunity to shine as the team’s starter in 2024 is a real possibility. Though injuries are unpredictable, it’s important to consider this scenario.\n\nEven in a secondary role behind Conner, Benson has the potential to make significant contributions with his explosive playmaking ability. Over the last two collegiate seasons, Benson has ranked 10th and third in breakaway percentage and 42nd and first in elusive rating, according to Pro Football Focus. With an offense that ranked fourth in neutral script rushing rate last year, there should be ample weekly rushing opportunities for Benson to provide flex value.\n\nAs a priority handcuff this season, Benson not only offers strong standalone value but also the potential to make a big impact if something happens to Conner.\n\nAtlanta Falcons — QB Kirk Cousins\n\nQB Desmond Ridder (2023), RB Tyler Allgeier (2022), WR Russell Gage (2021), TE Hayden Hurst (2020), TE Austin Hooper (2019)\n\nKirk Cousins faces numerous challenges heading into the upcoming fantasy season. Despite recovering from a significant injury and approaching his 36th birthday, he’s adapting to a new team system following a multi-year contract signing. Nevertheless, Cousins remains an intriguing sleeper pick for 2024.\n\nAnticipated to maintain a high passing volume, he joins a potent Falcons offense boasting Drake London, Kyle Pitts, and Bijan Robinson — all former top 10 picks. This supporting cast positions him to potentially achieve borderline QB1 status, even in his recovery phase. If everything really breaks right, he could be an even bigger asset than that.\n\nBaltimore Ravens — Devontez Walker\n\nWR Rashid Bateman (2023), WR Devin Duvernay (2022), WR Rashod Bateman (2021), RB J.K. Dobbins (2020), RB Mark Ingram (2019)\n\nYou should know by now I really like the value that comes from rookie wide receivers. You can usually get them late and they are eager to produce right away. Devontez Walker is my sleeper pick for the Ravens in 2024. Despite a challenging journey marked by injuries and NCAA hurdles, Walker showcased his talent with a strong 2022 season at Kent State. After transferring to North Carolina and impressing with 41 catches for 699 yards and seven touchdowns in just part of the 2023 season, the Ravens saw his potential and nabbed him in the fourth round.\n\nWalker fits perfectly as an X receiver in Baltimore’s system. With his resilience and skill, he has the potential to become a key offensive weapon and a potential valuable fantasy asset in 2024.\n\nBuffalo Bills — WR Keon Coleman\n\nTE Dalton Kincaid (2023), RB James Cook (2022), WR Gabriel Davis (2021), WR John Brown (2020), WR Cole Beasley (2019)\n\nKeon Coleman landed in a prime spot for rookie wide receivers after the Buffalo Bills traded away Stefon Diggs, making Coleman the 8th receiver picked in the top 33. Despite this, it’s important not to expect him to immediately replicate Diggs’ impact. While Coleman’s college production is similar to Diggs’, Diggs was more prolific and was a veteran receiver who delivered consistent NFL results.\n\nJosh Allen can certainly target Coleman, but he also runs the ball frequently, as shown by his 15 rushing touchdowns last year. With Coleman, you’re banking on his upside in that you should be able to get him for close to nothing.\n\nCarolina Panthers — QB Bryce Young\n\nTE Hayden Hurst (2023), TE Tommy Tremble (2022), QB Sam Darnold (2021), TE Ian Thomas (2020), WR D.J. Moore 2019)\n\nI had to pick someone, and honestly when it comes to the Panthers it’s a tough decision. Bryce Young might be a sleeper pick in fantasy football this year. Last season, he faced numerous challenges: a weak group of pass-catchers, an inconsistent offensive line, and a head coach change mid-season. Despite these setbacks, he still managed to rush for 253 yards, showcasing his athleticism.\n\nYoung often had to extend plays due to his receivers’ inability to get open, which forced him to stay in the pocket longer. However, with new head coach Dave Canales bringing in fresh talent, Young’s situation looks more promising heading into Year 2.\n\nChicago Bears — QB Caleb Williams\n\nRB Roschon Johnson (2023), QB Justin Fields (2022), WR Darnell Mooney (2021), WR Anthony Miller (2020), WR Allen Robinson (2019)\n\nSurrounded by a talented roster, Caleb Williams has all the tools he needs to develop into an excellent quarterback. While he might show flashes of brilliance in 2024, his consistency might still be a work in progress, which could lead to erratic fantasy performances. Fantasy quarterbacks who excel either have outstanding passing stats or add significant value with their rushing ability.\n\nWith the now ample plethora of weapons the Bears have and Williams potential gains on the run, he is someone to target if you like waiting to take a quarterback once the top guys all get selected.\n\nCincinnati Bengals — TE Mike Gesicki\n\nTE Ira Smith Jr. (2023), TE Hayden Hurst (2022), QB Joe Burrow (2021), QB Joe Burrow (2020), QB Andy Dalton (2019)\n\nDespite a significant salary drop from his franchise tag days in Miami, he’s in one of his best spots since 2021. Mike Gesicki has often played more like a slot receiver, running over 60% of his snaps from the slot and 20% from a wide position. Last year in New England, he was running a route on a career-high 95.8% of his pass snaps, despite limited playing time and targets.\n\nNow in Cincinnati, he benefits from the departure of slot receiver Tyler Boyd and QB Joe Burrow’s praise for his catch radius and explosiveness. With a weak tight end depth chart and rookie Jermaine Burton likely taking on a primary slot role, Gesicki has a clear path to a significant role in the offense, making him a valuable fantasy sleeper for 2024.\n\nCleveland Browns — RB Jerome Ford\n\nWR Elijah Moore (2023), WR Donovan Peoples-Jones (2022), WR Donovan Peoples-Jones (2021), QB Baker Mayfield (2020), QB Baker Mayfield (2019)\n\nJerome Ford could find himself as the Browns’ starting tailback again this season due to uncertainties surrounding Nick Chubb’s health. Although Chubb’s recovery has shown promise, there’s no guarantee he will be available early in the season or at all in 2024. Last season, from Weeks 3-17, Ford averaged 14.9 touches and 66.6 total yards per game, ranking as the RB20 in fantasy.\n\nIf Ford retains the starting role, he should be considered an RB2 with potential upside, especially if he can fend off competition from D’Onta Foreman for early-down work and Nyheim Hines in the passing game.\n\nDallas Cowboys — Defense/ST\n\nTE Luke Schoonmaker (2023), WR James Washington (2022), WR Michael Gallup (2021), TE Blake Jarwin (2020), WR Michael Gallup (2019)\n\nDespite the departure of Dan Quinn, the Cowboys retain Micah Parsons, prompting me to rank them as a top three defense in drafts. Many may avoid taking them due to Quinn’s departure, but not me. Securing them in the last three rounds of your draft should be cause for celebration.\n\nDespite a quiet offseason in terms of big acquisitions, this might prove advantageous for their defensive unit. The 2023 Cowboys led all defenses in fantasy points and ranked in the top five for both points and yards allowed. It can happen again in 2024.\n\nDenver Broncos — WR Josh Reynolds\n\nTE Greg Dulcich (2023), TE Greg Dulcich (2022), RB Javonte Williams (2021), QB Drew Lock (2020), WR Courtland Sutton (2019)\n\nJosh Reynolds arrives in Denver this season with a chance to earn a starting role after joining the Broncos in the offseason. While not necessarily a draft priority in most leagues, Reynolds presents an intriguing waiver wire or bench target. Despite Courtland Sutton’s established presence atop the depth chart, Reynolds is in contention for the second receiver spot, potentially ahead of Tim Patrick, and Troy Franklin, though his position isn’t guaranteed.\n\nDespite modest production in previous seasons with the Rams and Lions, Reynolds could become a viable low-end No. 3 receiver in deeper leagues this season.\n\nDetroit Lions — WR Jameson Williams\n\nRB David Montgomery (2023), WR Jameson Williams (2022), WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (2021), TE T.J. Hockenson (2020), WR Kenny Golladay (2019)\n\nTargeting Jameson Williams as a sleeper pick in 2024 presents an enticing opportunity, especially in the mid-rounds of your draft. Entering his third NFL season, Williams appears poised to break out after overcoming early career setbacks.\n\nHindered by a torn ACL in his rookie year and a subsequent suspension for gambling in his second, he has amassed a modest 95.4 PPR points over two seasons. With the previously mentioned Josh Reynolds departed, Williams now secures a starting role and can inherit Reynolds’ 64 targets.\n\nGreen Bay Packers — WR Dontayvion Wicks\n\nWR Jayden Reed (2023), WR Christian Watson (2022), RB A.J. Dillon (2021), RB A.J. Dillon (2020), WR Geronimo Allison (2019)\n\nDontayvion Wicks stands poised to make a significant impact in the Packers’ offense, potentially becoming a hidden gem for fantasy managers. His impressive metrics suggest he could thrive as a key contributor on the perimeter within Green Bay’s offensive scheme.\n\nDespite facing competition in a deep wide receiver corps, Wicks represents an enticing late-round selection, offering substantial upside as a primary target in this dynamic offense.\n\nHouston Texans — RB Jawhar Jordan\n\nQB C.J. Stroud (2023), TE Brevin Jordan (2022), WR Keke Coutee (2021), RB David Johnson (2020), WR Keke Coutee (2019)\n\nThe Texans are absolutely loaded with young talent. They will really be a fun team to watch this season. With that, they don’t have many sleepers because everyone pretty much knows their roster. A deep, deep darkhorse sleeper I think is running back Jawhar Jordan.\n\nHe’s the complete opposite of Joe Mixon, where he’s more like what Tennessee used to have with Chris Johnson. He’s not a pile-mover, but he's super quick and if behind a good offensive line, he could make an impact.\n\nIndianapolis Colts — QB Anthony Richardson\n\nWR Josh Downs (2023), QB Matt Ryan (2022), QB Carson Wentz (2021), WR Michael Pittman Jr. (2020), WR Devin Funchess (2019)\n\nAnthony Richardson showed promise in his rookie year, playing well in three full games before a shoulder injury ended his season. He excels at running the ball, scoring four rushing touchdowns and gaining significant yards in those games. While he’s still developing as a passer, he thrives in a fast-paced offense under Shane Steichen, known for its quick tempo and use of run-pass options (RPOs).\n\nRichardson’s potential is boosted by learning the Colts’ system last season and the prospect of playing alongside Jonathan Taylor. With his strong rushing ability, he’s a solid fantasy QB1 and could rank among the top five quarterbacks in the league by season’s end.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars — WR Brian Thomas\n\nRB Tank Bigsby (2023), WR Christian Kirk (2022), WR Laviska Shenault Jr. (2021), TE Tyler Eifert (2020), WR Marqise Lee (2019)\n\nDrafted as the second LSU wide receiver in 2024, Brian Thomas is one of my top sleeper picks in this year’s draft class. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 209 pounds, he combines size with impressive athleticism. Thomas’s blazing 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine highlights his speed and ability to make big plays.\n\nLeading the FBS with 17 touchdowns, he’s underrated in route running but joins a promising Jaguars offense with Gabe Davis and Christian Kirk.\n\nKansas City Chiefs — WR Xavier Worthy\n\nWR Skyy Moore (2023), WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling (2022), WR Demarcus Robinson (2021), RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire (2020), WR Mecole Hardman (2019)\n\nWorthy is currently being drafted around pick 94 in the 8th round, which seems high given uncertainties about him and the Chiefs’ offense. He’s going ahead of established players like Nick Chubb, Christian Watson, and Courtland Sutton. With that being said, the potential is there and I really do like taking rookie receivers because the sky is the limit and there’s usually low risk as team’s feel pressured to get the rookies involved early.\n\nWorthy does have a lot of competition on the Chiefs for targets, but if he’s there late I would recommend absolutely snagging him.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers — WR Ladd McConkey\n\nWR Quentin Johnston (2023), WR Jalen Guyton (2022), TE Jared Cook (2021), QB Tyrod Taylor (2020), TE Hunter Henry (2019)\n\nInsert Ladd McConkey, yet another sleeper pick at wide receiver for me. Drafted 34th overall in 2024, he joins the Chargers’ revamped offense under new coach Jim Harbaugh. McConkey’s tenure at Georgia showcased his talent with 478 yards in nine games.\n\nKnown for his route running and acceleration, he steps into a Chargers team missing key playmakers like Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. Watch out for McConkey as a breakout fantasy football star in 2024, especially in PPR formats.\n\nLos Angeles Rams — RB Blake Corum\n\nRB Kyren Williams (2023), WR Van Jefferson (2022), TE Tyler Higbee (2021), RB Cam Akers (2020), WR Josh Reynolds (2019)\n\nCorum emerges as my sleeper pick for the Rams after showcasing his prowess at Michigan. With consecutive seasons of over 1,250 rush yards and 18+ touchdowns, he’s proven adept in any offensive scheme, breaking tackles and gaining significant yardage. While his receiving opportunities were limited, Corum excels in vision and cutting ability, akin to Kyren Williams.\n\nGiven Williams’ injury history, Corum could lead a potent offense with ample touches, as evidenced by his starting role in OTAs. He’s a prime target in Round 9 of redraft leagues and warrants consideration as an early second-round pick in rookie drafts.\n\nMiami Dolphins — RB Jaylen Wright\n\nRB De’Von Achane (2023), WR Cedrick Wilson (2022), QB Tua Tagovailoa (2021), WR Preston Williams (2020), WR Kenny Stills (2019)\n\nA team with arguably the most potential to get you fantasy points on offense is the Miami Dolphins. With that, rookie running back Jaylen Wright is my fantasy sleeper for the Dolphins, poised to capitalize on Miami’s potent backfield opportunities. The Dolphins led all teams with 579.7 PPR points from their running backs last season, signaling ample room for multiple contributors.\n\nWhile Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane are initial favorites, both face durability concerns. Wright, drafted for his blazing speed, adds depth to Miami’s strategy despite not starting immediately. Expect him to carve out a meaningful role in 2024, offering fantasy relevance and production as the season unfolds.\n\nMinnesota Vikings — QB Sam Darnold\n\nWR Jordan Addison (2023), TE Irv Smith Jr. (2022), TE Irv Smith Jr. (2021), WR Justin Jefferson (2020), QB Kirk Cousins (2019)\n\nSam Darnold, once a top pick for the Jets, faced ups and downs before finding stability briefly with the Panthers and 49ers. Now with the Vikings, he joins a team in need of quarterback stability after Kirk Cousins’ departure.\n\nWith a talented supporting cast including Justin Jefferson and T.J. Hockenson, Darnold has the opportunity to thrive and minimize turnovers, making him a potential sleeper for both the Vikings and fantasy football managers. I am a Sam Darnold believer, and think he can win the starting job this year.\n\nNew England Patriots — WR DeMario Douglas\n\nTE Mike Gesicki (2023), RB Pierre Strong Jr. (2022), WR Jakobi Meyers (2021), WR N’Keal Harry (2020), WR N’Keal Harry (2019)\n\nAfter emerging as a fantasy sleeper with promising second-half performances last year, DeMario Douglas is likely to benefit from quarterback Drake Maye’s arrival. However, competition is stiff with Kendrick Bourne’s return and rookies Ja’Lynn Polk and Javon Baker joining the Patriots.\n\nDouglas stepped up when Bourne was injured, averaging 6.9 targets per game in his final nine appearances. With improved quarterback play, he has potential as a WR3 in fantasy, but the crowded receiving corps limits his draft value to Round 14 in redraft leagues.\n\nNew Orleans Saints — WR Bub Means\n\nWR Rashid Shaheed (2023), WR Chris Olave (2022), QB Jameis Winston (2021), RB Latavius Murray (2020), TE Jared Cook (2019)\n\nThe Saints picked Bub Means in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL Draft, aiming to integrate him into three-wide receiver formations early in his rookie year. Standing at 6-foot-1 and 212 pounds, Means brings prototypical size and excels in deep-ball situations, reminiscent of quarterbacks like Jameis Winston.\n\nWhile current starter Derek Carr may require adjustment, Means holds promise as a developmental project, especially behind Chris Olave. Consider him a solid option in Round 5 of rookie-only drafts due to his untapped potential and fit within the Saints’ offensive plans, and he is someone to keep on your radar during the season.\n\nNew York Giants — RB Tyrone Tracy, Jr.\n\nWR Wan’Dale Robinson (2023), WR Kadarius Toney (2022), QB Daniel Jones (2021), QB Daniel Jones (2020), WR Golden Tate (2019)\n\nWith Saquon Barkley gone, the Giants’ pre-draft running back options included Devin Singletary, Eric Gray (a 2023 fifth-round pick), and little else promising. This opened up a significant opportunity for any new draft additions. Tyrone Tracy Jr., a standout from Purdue at 5′ 11⅛” and 209 pounds, has impressed with 714 yards, eight touchdowns, and notable metrics including 46 forced missed tackles and 14 carries of 15+ yards on only 114 attempts.\n\nRenowned for his big-play ability and strong receiving skills, Tracy’s versatility significantly enhances the Giants’ roster depth after being drafted 166th overall in the fifth round.\n\nNew York Jets — WR Malachi Corley\n\nTE Tyler Conklin (2023), WR Braxton Berrios (2022), QB Zach Wilson (2021), WR Denzel Mims (2020), TE Chris Herndon (2019)\n\nCorley presents an intriguing case for redraft leagues despite uncertainties in dynasty formats, especially as Aaron Rodgers nears the twilight of his career in New York. Teaming up with Garrett Wilson and Mike Williams, Corley is set to make an immediate impact from the slot as early as Week 1.\n\nDespite playing at Western Kentucky against lesser competition, Corley showcased his talent with double-digit touchdowns in each of his final two seasons. While he may initially trail Breece Hall in target distribution, expect Corley to emerge as a pivotal receiver for the Jets, particularly in receptions.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders — TE Brock Bowers\n\nTE Michael Mayer (2023), WR Demarcus Robinson (2022), WR John Brown (2021), WR Hunter Renfrow (2020), RB Josh Jacobs (2019)\n\nConsidered one of the top tight end prospects since Kyle Pitts, Brock Bowers was drafted 13th overall by the Raiders. Standing at 6-4, 230 pounds, he consistently posted impressive numbers at the University of Georgia, with at least 56 catches and 714 receiving yards each season, totaling 31 touchdowns in 40 games.\n\nBowers combines speed with excellent hands and yards-after-catch ability, despite not fitting the typical tight end size. Despite the Raiders’ quarterback situation and a star receiver in Davante Adams, Bowers’ athleticism and receiving skills are poised to make an immediate impact.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles — RB Will Shipley\n\nWR Quiz Watkins (2023), RB Kenneth Gainwell (2022), WR DeVonta Smith (2021), QB Carson Wentz (2020), WR DeSean Jackson (2019)\n\nWill Shipley, a dynamic fourth-round rookie running back, is a natural fit for the Philadelphia Eagles’ versatile rushing scheme. Known for his discipline and explosiveness in inside-zone and RPO runs, Shipley also excels as a shifty receiver and talented kickoff returner.\n\nHe’s set to compete immediately for the No. 2 rushing role, primary passing-down duties, and a significant role in kickoff returns, leveraging the NFL’s new return-friendly rules. Shipley is a sleeper to watch among 2024 rookie running backs, especially in formats that reward kickoff return yardage, showcasing his versatile skill set for the Eagles’ offense.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers — WR Roman Wilson\n\nRB Jaylen Warren (2023), WR George Pickens (2022), Defense (2021), WR Diontae Johnson (2020), WR James Washington (2019)\n\nThe Steelers drafted Roman Wilson from Michigan in the third round, eyeing him as a potential No. 2 receiver behind George Pickens this season. He’s a valuable late-round pick in redraft leagues and a strong second-round choice in rookie-only drafts for Dynasty leagues. Wilson steps into a promising role with either Russell Wilson at quarterback.\n\nHe’s set to start or be the team’s third receiver, given his solid production of 48 catches, 789 yards, and 12 touchdowns last season at Michigan, making him a sleeper pick for Fantasy managers.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers — WR Ricky Pearsall\n\nQB Sam Darnold (2023), QB Trey Lance (2022), QB Trey Lance (2021), WR Brandon Aiyuk (2020), RB Tevin Coleman (2019)\n\nThe 49ers made a surprising move by drafting Pearsall in 2024, focusing on his long-term potential rather than immediate impact. Known for precise route running and reliable hands, he excels at finding openings against zone coverage, despite not possessing top-end speed.\n\nPearsall’s breakout 2023 season, with nearly 1,000 yards on 65 receptions, highlights his upward trajectory from modest beginnings at Arizona State and Florida. While his role behind Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel isn’t assured this year, Pearsall has a chance to make a spot for himself in year one. Take him late in your draft, if available.\n\nSeattle Seahawks — WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba\n\nK Jason Myers (2023), TE Noah Fant (2022), WR D’Wayne Eskridge (2021), TE Will Dissly (2020), WR D.K. Metcalf (2019)\n\nSmith-Njigba is set for a breakout sophomore season with Seattle. Emerging as a top target late last year with 25 targets in the final six games, he’s likely to lead in receptions and targets this season. While not a deep threat like DK Metcalf, he could surpass Tyler Lockett’s numbers.\n\nDespite a slow start due to injuries, Smith-Njigba excelled in the slot, particularly in PPR leagues. His late-season heroics, including two game-winning touchdowns, underscore his growing role and red zone impact. Watch for him to push into WR3 territory as he expands his influence in Seattle’s offense.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers — TE Cade Otton\n\nWR Trey Palmer (2023), WR Russell Gage (2022), RB Giovani Bernard (2021), RB Ronald Jones II (2020), WR Chris Godwin (2019)\n\nEntering his third NFL season, Otton looks primed for a breakout year in 2024. Despite his modest output of 47 catches and 455 yards last season, navigating the week-to-week unpredictability that characterizes the tight end position was challenging.\n\nHowever, with only a select few tight ends offering consistent fantasy production, Otton stands poised to exceed 50 catches and 500 yards this season. He presents an intriguing late-round option with the potential to deliver significant value for fantasy managers.\n\nTennessee Titans — QB Will Levis\n\nRB Tyjae Spears (2023), TE Austin Hooper (2022), WR Josh Reynolds (2021), QB Ryan Tannehill (2020), TE Delanie Walker (2019)\n\nLevis is poised as a fantasy sleeper for the Titans in 2024. He showed promise as a rookie with four TD passes in his debut but struggled later on. Now, with Brian Callahan leading the offense and his father, Bill Callahan, improving the offensive line with first-round pick JC Latham, Levis has a solid foundation.\n\nThe additions of Calvin Ridley and Tony Pollard add to the team’s offensive firepower. With these upgrades, Levis has potential to rise into QB2 or even QB1 territory in fantasy, despite being undrafted in most 1QB leagues.\n\nWashington Commanders — QB Jayden Daniels\n\nQB Sam Howell (2023), QB Carson Wentz (2022), QB Ryan Fitzpatrick (2021), RB Adrian Peterson (2020), RB Adrian Peterson (2019)\n\nJayden Daniels is my top fantasy sleeper for the Commanders in 2024. He shined with 40 passing touchdowns and 11 rushing touchdowns at LSU. With Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson in Washington, Daniels is set for NFL success.\n\nIn redraft leagues, target him as a steal in later rounds, possibly as a high-end QB2. In dynasty leagues, consider Daniels around 1.03 in Superflex formats. If he meets his potential, Daniels could exceed expectations and become a fantasy star."
