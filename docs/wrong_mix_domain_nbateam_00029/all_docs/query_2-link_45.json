        "text": "Kidd teamed up with Jason Terry, Tyson Chandler and Dirk Nowiski to help the Mavericks beat the Miami Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals. At the age of 38, Jason Kidd was finally an NBA champion. His skills declined over the final two years of his career, averaging 6.1 points per game until retiring as a New York Knick in 2013. He retired as a 10-time All Star as well as a champion and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nCoaching Career\n\nJason Kidd had a whirlwind start to his retirement. He was hired as the Brooklyn Nets head coach in 2013 and subsequently bought a minority stake in the team from the rapper Jay-Z. He was suspended the first two games of the season for a DWI conviction the previous year. Initially, he struggled to control a veteran group that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson. Things started to turn for the better in January and March of 2014 when he was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month. After defeating the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the playoffs, Kiddâ€™s Nets lost to the Miami Heat, ending his rookie season as a coach.\n\nIn a rare move, the Milwaukee Bucks traded two second-round draft picks for Kidd to be their new coach. His tenure in Brooklyn ended badly as he stated that he never felt wanted nor did he feel like the organization truly wanted to build a contender. Brooklyn fans loathed him for those comments and they booed him mercilessly when he returned with the Bucks on November 19, 2014. Kidd had the last laugh and defeated his former team in triple overtime 122-118.\n\nHe led the Bucks to the 2015 NBA playoffs where they lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the first round. After a down year in 2016, he led the Bucks to the 2017 NBA playoffs where they again lost in the first round, this time to Raptors. The Bucks started off slow the following year and after a 23-22 start, fired Kidd in January of 2018. He was hired as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2019-2020 season and beat the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals that year. He still remains a Lakers assistant."
