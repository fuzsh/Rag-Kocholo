        "text": "The trade sending Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry to the Brooklyn Nets became official Friday, and the Nets wasted no time getting their new acquisitions’ black-and-white jerseys up for sale.\n\nThe team listed authentic and replica jerseys of Garnett, Pierce and Terry for sale on its online store, selling the home white and road black versions. The authentic Garnett adidas Swingman jersey — featuring the No. 2, not the No. 5 Celtics fans got used to seeing over the last six years — is being sold for $109.95, while the replica is listed at $69.95.\n\nGarnett’s number change is his way to honor former teammate and friend Malik Sealy, according to The Nosebleeds. Sealy, who was killed by a drunk driver in 2000, wore No. 2 while he and Garnett were teammates in Minnesota.\n\nThe NBA didn’t take long to discount the now-outdated Garnett and Pierce Celtics jerseys, dropping the price to as low as $24.97 for a replica Pierce road jersey on its online store.\n\nAlthough Pierce and KG will soon be putting on a different team’s jersey for the first time in years, their respective green-and-white No. 34 and No. 5 jerseys will almost certainly be worn proudly throughout Boston for years to come."
