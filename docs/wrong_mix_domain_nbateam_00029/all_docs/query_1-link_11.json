        "text": "The course that set the Boston Celtics down their current path as nascent title contenders at this point of the 2021-22 NBA season can be traced to the fateful decision of then-team president Danny Ainge to trade his 2007-08 title core to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nUnbeknownst to most of the world, the trio of stars the Celtics sent to the Nets might not have moved had the original plan for the trade been insisted on by Brooklyn or Ainge. The deal, which sent Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Jason Terry to the Nets along with DJ White for salary matching purposes was very nearly vetoed by Garnett out of concern for Terry, according to the Arizona native in a recent interview with the Celtics Wire.\n\nTerry explained he was not part of the original package going to Brooklyn, and he was only added after Garnett threatened to block the trade without the inclusion of the JET (as Terry is sometimes called)."
