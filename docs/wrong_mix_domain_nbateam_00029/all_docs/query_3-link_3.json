        "text": "Jason Terry’s NBA playing career stretched across three decades—starting with his 10th overall selection by the Atlanta Hawks in the 1999 draft and ending with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2018. He finished his 19-year career with the seventh-most three-pointers made all-time and won a championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011.\n\nThe combo guard known as “The Jet” built a reputation as one of the game’s most clutch performers with a penchant for hitting big-time shots. Terry won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year with the Mavericks in 2009 and played other seasons with the Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets and Houston Rockets.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Terry quickly transitioned to the front office in 2019 as an assistant general manager for the NBA G League’s Texas Legends. He was hired in 2020 as an assistant men’s basketball coach at his alma mater, the University of Arizona. He left the Wildcats after one season to become head coach of the Grand Rapids Gold, the G League affiliate of the Denver Nuggets. The Gold narrowly missed this year’s G League playoffs, finishing with a 17-15 record.\n\nIn February, Terry joined virtual personal training app FlexIt as its head of athletic performance. The app connects users with personal trainers who host live 1-on-1 workouts over video that start as low as $30 per session. Athlete ambassadors to have completed at-home workouts with FlexIt include NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens and former USWNT star Carli Lloyd. In March, FlexIt became the official virtual fitness partner of the NHL’s Florida Panthers.\n\nOn his introduction to virtual personal training app FlexIt . . .\n\nI was at a fitness conference for all the top gyms, performance, health, fitness systems. I did an appearance for FlexIt at their booth and got to meet [FlexIt CEO] Austin Cohen and [COO] Justin [Turetsky] and their group, and the synergy was great. It's a platform that I believe in. In my 19-year career playing, I always had the luxury of a personal trainer. Once I retired, I didn't have that anymore, so I was like, ‘Where am I going to fill that void?’ I'm not a big guy that goes into the gym a lot; I like to work out on my own. So the platform kind of fit what I was looking for, that special attention, personal training and that one-on-one deal. But knowing it’s COVID times, having somebody virtually and not having to go out and go into a gym, it just made it so much more convenient. With that convenience, wherever, whenever, you can use the FlexIt platform. They’ve got a great group of trainers who are world class personal trainers, and they specialize in health and wellness. The plans are catered directly to you.\n\n-- Jason Terry\n\nOn training his NBA G League players over Zoom during the pandemic . . .\n\nWhat's crazy is before I even knew about FlexIt, we were kind of using a similar platform on Zoom. We send the guys the workout, and then we'd have them log into the Zoom and conference call. They would have to show us walking through the workouts. It was very similar to FlexIt. Now, Zoom gets a little choppy. It's not quite the connectivity you want, and you still don't get that personal feel. The platform with FlexIt though, you do get that. But very similar strategy in what we were trying to get accomplished.\n\nWe're back to normal now. Everybody's in-person in the facility, which is always nice. It's one thing to be virtual, but you know the other thing is if you can do it in person, that's always the best thing. But when you don't have that, obviously, you have the FlexIt platform to get it done.\n\nOn the future of virtual training coming out of the pandemic . . .\n\nYeah, I think especially with personal training it's probably here to stay. Because there's still a fear of people going into gyms and interacting with a lot of people in small spaces, right? Where the machines have to be sanitized. What better way to stay healthy and stay safe than to do it within the confines of your own environment? So that's it for me, the sanity of it all and the convenience.\n\nOn how fitness training has changed since his NBA playing days . . .\n\nMan, it was so much different then, than it is now. I was an old school guy. We hit the tracks at 6 a.m., we run the stadium stairs. We were running hills, run and jump in the sandpit to get agility work in. A lot of that stuff changed. The method behind it has not changed, you have to have a routine, you have to have self-willpower, the discipline to accomplish a goal. But then you also need that presence. That voice that's telling you, ‘Let's get that extra rep’ or pushing you to get to the next level of fitness. That's what FlexIt does, it fills that void, as well. Technologies are advanced now, it's a little more different than the free weights and the heavy dumbbells, the bench-press. But now you have functional movements, functional weight. There's different plyometric boxes that people use, what used to be hard boxes, now they’ve got the soft foam ones.\n\nOn the role of analytics in coaching the Grand Rapids Gold . . .\n\nAs coaches, we try to use player tracking and analytics to the best of our ability, understanding that — that's all that is. That's still not going to draw you up the play to win a game. You draw that play up and throw it to a guy, he's still got to make the shot. We can say he shoots 60% but nobody knows how he's feeling in that moment. We use it to our advantage though to scout opponents, to put our guys in the best possible position, so they can succeed. It's getting more and more advanced. Early in my career, it was like, ‘Okay, the Jet's going to go right 80% of the time. Why? Because if I watch film that's all he’s doing is going right, if he goes left he’s not going to be as good.’ Just having that type of advanced analytics and the information, it definitely helps you game plan for your guys.\n\nYou can't measure what's within, man. Sometimes what's within, too, changes now. We like to say it changes like the weather. You never know what a guy is going through in his personal space, where his mental health is. There's no analytic for that in that particular moment. But you want all the information. The more information sometimes the better and the easier it is to navigate whatever obstacle you're going to endure.\n\nOn using the Shot Spectrum system to help coach the Grand Rapids Gold . . .\n\nWe don't have systems to measure arc of the shot or anything to that nature. But we do have something we call Shot Spectrum. We use this technology; the Denver Nuggets use it. It's kind of like a system that's designed to show you the highest percentage shots per shot that you take, and what we like to get within our offense. It's good to track from time to time because you’ll have games where you're trying to figure out, why aren't we scoring above our average or we're not meeting our average? And if you look at our Shot Spectrum, we're taking tough, contested two-point shots, which that's not within our spectrum. We like threes, we like layups, and we like free throws. And uncontested mid-range shots. So that's the only shot technology that we use.\n\nOn how the NBA playing style has changed since his playing career . . .\n\nI think before, guys were kind of put in a box. If you're a big man, you went inside; if you're a guard, you played on the perimeter. As we started to evolve, and as players like a Dirk Nowitzki, Nikola Jokić, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant—those type of players that are seven feet but can dribble and shoot— we just got outside of that box that we were putting each other in. And even if you look at LeBron James, even going back further than that with Magic [Johnson]— those guys [didn’t have] positions. There is no position for their skill set. So we have to be more innovative and have a broader scope and say its position-less basketball. We're not gonna put those guys in a box. If they can hoop and they can shoot outside, let them shoot outside. If they can go off the dribble, let them go out off the dribble.\n\nI always believed the game should be played with your strength. Whatever that is, that's what you do every time you step on the floor. I'm an analytic guy so I can use it to my advantage, but I'm never going to play a game of basketball and not let it be pure. To me an open shot is a good shot. I don't care where it's at. If you're open, and it's your range, and it's your shot, you take it. You practice that shot, you take it. I just like to play the game for its purity and in the right way. Pass up a good shot to get a great shot.\n\nOn his transition from playing to coaching . . .\n\nIt's been a seamless process. I've had a great support system, my mentors that I've played for, played with. Jason Kidd, Avery Johnson, Rick Carlisle, Damon Stoudamire. All those guys served as mentors for me in my coaching journey. This is something that I knew I wanted to do once I started coaching. In my offseason, I would coach my daughter's AAU youth team. This was a highly competitive team. We're one of the top programs in women's basketball in the country—we still are 15 years and running. Every summer I go out, I'll drive that 15-passenger van, I coach those girls, and we compete. And all my girls go to college on scholarships.\n\nSo for me, coaching was in me early. And then as I got later in my career, I served as the veteran in the locker room. Kevin McHale and J.B. Bickerstaff in Houston [Rockets] allowed me to be a part of the coaches' meetings. And a year and two years later, Jason Kidd was my coach in Milwaukee [Bucks], he allowed me to start doing some scouting. He allowed me to do player development and allowed me to be a part of the coaches' meetings as well. The fire was lit. My first year out I was the assistant GM with the [G League’s] Texas Legends, evaluating talent, trying to put a team together and learning the business of basketball. Then when I became an assistant at [University of] Arizona, I worked under Sean Miller, and I learned about recruiting, compliance, some strategy type things. But a lot of that was already in me because I was student of the game.\n\nI get the opportunity now to become the head coach of the Grand Rapids, and I couldn't ask for a better opportunity. To lead men, to lead a program and to showcase my coaching skills, as well. A lot of times coaching is not about X's and O's. It's more about your relationship, your connectivity with the players. Getting the best and bringing the best version of someone, bringing that out of them. Then putting them in a position so they can showcase their individual talent within a team concept. That's what it's all about for me. And we always play for the win.\n\nOn the G League Ignite and Overtime Elite serving as professional alternatives for teenage prospects who skip college . . .\n\nKevin Garnett's jersey just was retired [in March] in Boston. When I think about the age difference from then until now, it's kind of reverting back to the system we had. If you're 18 and you're talented, and you're skilled enough to come out here and compete against the world's best grown men, then why shouldn't you be afforded that opportunity? And for me, college is one thing, but not all people are going to college to get an education. Sometimes their education in college is basketball. If that education is advanced, and they can pass that test so to speak, and make an NBA team and roster and get drafted, I'd give them that opportunity.\n\n--Jason Terry\n\nI don't care if he was 16, 17 or 18. If you look at European basketball and international competitions, the way it’s played and how it's designed, those guys are pros at 15, 16 years old. They learn as their body develops to become more physical, because of what they're going through out there against bigger and stronger players. So when they come to our league, they're that much more advanced because they're equipped to handle it not only physically, but mentally from the competition. If we got a guy that's physically and mentally mature enough to come in and handle the rigors of an 82-game season, I mean, you got to give them that opportunity. Especially now because with NIL, you can get paid in college. If you're a professional and you're good at what you do, you should be rewarded for it.\n\nWe played Ignite in what we call the G league Showcase. I watched because I recruited a couple of those guys, Jaden Hardy, MarJon Beauchamp, we recruited those guys when I was at Arizona. So I was familiar with them. Those guys have NBA talents. One thing that you have to understand when you're looking at talent and you're evaluating talent is: what is their transferable skill set? Look at Jaden Hardy, his transferable skill set is he's a daily scorer, he can shoot with range. He scores at all three levels. MarJon Beauchamp is an elite athlete, he can play multiple positions. Those things translate to our NBA game and make them a very valuable commodity when you talk about being on an NBA roster. Could they have gone to college? Yes. Would they have been All-Americans? Probably. But I think going to the G league Ignite team, it just fast forwarded, it sped up their process so to speak.\n\nOn his favorite teammates during his 19-year NBA playing career . . .\n\nJ Kidd [Jason Kidd] definitely hands down one of my favorites. Playing with him at the age he was at, he was still evolving as a player. Because he couldn't physically do the things that he could do when he was young when he first came in the league, with his speed and his physical ability, he started to use his mind to think and manage the game as a coach on the floor. He taught me how to see the game before it was played. I thought playing with him was just phenomenal. Dirk Nowitzki obviously. His competitiveness, his work ethic. Being in the gym, late night before practice, after practice on the road. Grinding in the gym with him. Me being on one end, him being on the other and just being able to look down there like 'Man, that's why he's so special.’ That to me was the ultimate. And then Kevin Garnett, geez man. You talk about a guy that is so selfless, would do literally anything to see his team win a game. The competitiveness that he played the game with, the ferocity of which he played with, the passion. Those are the type of guys that you understand why they're Hall of Famers.\n\n--Jason Terry"
