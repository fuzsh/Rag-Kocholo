Terry rented the 23.5-carat stainless steel customized timepiece from prolific New York jeweler Eric Mavachev — who professionally goes by Eric Mavani and is nicknamed “Eric Da Jeweler” — according to a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit filed Monday.\n\nFormer Brooklyn Net and Utah Jazz assistant coach Jason Terry is refusing to pay for a $25,000 diamond encrusted Rolex that he rented for an event and later agreed to buy from a celebrity jeweler, new court papers allege. Terry rented the 23.5-carat stainless steel customized timepiece from prolific New York jeweler Eric Mavachev — who professionally goes by Eric Mavani and is nicknamed “Eric Da Jeweler” — according to a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit filed Monday.\n\nThe 19-year NBA vet borrowed the flashy watch to wear out to Drai’s nightclub in Las Vegas during the summer league, Mavachev’s lawyer Mark Shirian told The Post. After, instead of returning the glitzy timepiece the former NBA combo guard — nicknamed “The Jet” — said he wanted to buy it from Mavachev, the filing says."
