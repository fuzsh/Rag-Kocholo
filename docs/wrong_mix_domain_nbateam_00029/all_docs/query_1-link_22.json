        "text": "As the Boston Celtics inch toward contender status with improved play on both ends of the court at the same time the Brooklyn Nets are trying to find enough health to compete for a title, the two teams could very well be on a postseason collision course.\n\nThat course began almost a decade ago when a fateful trade sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry to Brooklyn. Given it is just weeks before Garnett will have his Celtics jersey raised to the rafters, we couldn’t think of a better person to talk about it with on the CLNS Media “Celtics Lab” podcast than the JET himself.\n\nIn this episode, Cameron Tabatabaie and Justin Quinn are joined by Terry to talk about his time in Boston in their last era of contention, what it was like playing with KG, how he thinks of the Celtics and Nets’ short and medium-term futures, what’s keeping him busy these days and plenty more.\n\nThis was a very fun pod that even has a Big Ticket in a helicopter story, so be sure to check it out."
