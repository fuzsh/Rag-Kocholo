        "text": "In a one-year span during the COVID-19 pandemic, Jim Boylen lost his brother to cancer, lost his marriage and lost his job as head coach of the Chicago Bulls. Adrift personally and professionally, Boylen didn’t know what was next. Then USA Basketball called him in 2021. Organization executives asked if he wanted to coach the men’s senior national team in qualifying games for the 2023 FIBA World Cup. “The only way you can be part of it is if you don’t have a job,” Boylen said. “I told (USA Basketball men’s national team director) Sean Ford I will swim there to do it.”\n\nAs much as USA Basketball needed a coach to help the men reach the 2023 FIBA World Cup which leads to qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics, Boylen needed the gig more. It was not high-profile, but that didn’t matter. “The blessing was that I got to grieve my divorce and be with my kids,” Boylen said. “I got to mourn the loss of my brother, and I got to get over getting fired.”\n\nSince some of those qualifying games fall during the NBA season, Boylen coached a team mainly of G League players against teams from FIBA Americas: Uruguay, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Columbia. Coaching in the 50-year-old Coliseo Roberto Clemente in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is nothing like coaching the Bulls in the United Center on a Saturday night. So what. “The competitive part of it,” Boylen explained, “was exactly what I needed at that point in my life.”"
