Jason Terry was a combo guard coming out of college, but started as a point guard in the NBA with the Atlanta Hawks. Terry had the ability to play both on and off the ball from the beginning.

Rumor has it Terry used to sleep in his jersey the night before his game. Apparently it would help him get amped up and ready to perform to the best of his abilities. However, he may or may not have discontinued those childish habits as he started to mature as a person and a player.

Terry's prime was in the mid-to-late 2000s but he was a consistent player throughout most of his career. He was always a competitor the coach could count on and it showed as he took thousands of jumpers in the gym each night.

Terry's wicked jumper came in different varieties; from the three, to the midrange, and occasionally the floater. The peak of his three-point accuracy came from 2004-2007 in which he shot over 41 percent from deep three straight years. Defenses could not ignore Terry for just one second or he would make them pay.

He was known as a pure shooter coming out of college but, most importantly, his teams came to find out he was a team player first and foremost. Interestingly enough, Terry averaged a career-high 19.7 points in only his sophomore season.

Eight years later he averaged 19.6 on the Mavs and won Sixth Man of the Year. Although he won the award only once, he finished among the top candidates several times. Terry carved out a niche as a dangerous bench player in his last few years with Dallas and helped set a new trend in the NBA showing how essential the sixth man could be.
