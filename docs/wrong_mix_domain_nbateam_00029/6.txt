In an interview conducted before the Knicks game, but posted afterwards, Jason Terry said he is not giving up on the Nets, that he remains positive about the team's prospects.

"Oh no doubt," he said when asked he was still optimistic. "We’re going to be a great team -- not a good team -- a great team," Terry said Wednesday. "And we just got to get healthy, number one, but we just got to continue to fight. Too many times, even when we did have our guys, when a team made a run on us or something, we've dropped our head and felt sorry for ourselves. Even at home, the fans start to boo, we feel sorry for ourselves. No, it’s just basketball."

On his injury, Terry said he'll be re-evaluated Monday and admitted it's now a new injury.

"This is not a new injury. This is something that I've had to deal with. And you knew it was going to be a process. I tried to come back earlier than what I thought, wasn't ready, but that’s just me. I’m a competitor, I don’t like to sit out. So now I've had to get stronger and hopefully this time it will be the last time."

Terry, 36, missed three games to injury last season. This year, he's already missed eight.
