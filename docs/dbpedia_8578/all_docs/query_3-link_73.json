Cell Ranger 1.2 and later support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v1 and v2 reagent kits, whereas Cell Ranger 1.1 and earlier do not support v2 libraries. Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines: - cellranger mkfastq wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and to convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files. - cellranger count takes FASTQ files from cellranger mkfastq and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting. - cellranger aggr aggregates outputs from multiple runs of cellranger count, normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data. - cellranger reanalyze takes gene-barcode matrices produced by cellranger count or cellranger aggr and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings. These pipelines combine Chromium-specific algorithms with the widely used RNA-seq aligner STAR. Output is delivered in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5 and HTML formats that are augmented with cellular information.

QuantumATK addresses key applications in the semiconductor industry and is a core component of the Synopsys Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) solution. Atomic-scale modeling tools in QuantumATK range from classical force fields for handling large and to some extent more realistic materials systems to ab initio tools that provide highly accurate results for smaller systems.

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and compariso"
