JTS conforms to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS Consortium. JTS is designed to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics software such as geographical information systems. It can also be used as a general-purpose library providing algorithms in computational geometry.\n\nCore features\n\nGeometry Model\n\nPoint, Line, Area\n\nGeometry Collections\n\nGeometry Operations\n\nAll SFSSQL operations: Intersect, union, within, ...\n\nFull DIM-9 Relationships\n\nPrecision handling\n\nWork with float, double, fixed, and double double coordinates\n\nGeometric constructions\n\nFactory driven construction for consistent configuration\n\nMetric functions\n\nCartesian 2D distance, Hausdorff distance, ...\n\nSpatial algorithms\n\nbuffer creation, line offsets, line simplification, ...\n\nSpatial structures\n\nSpatial indexes: Quadtree and R-tree\n\nAdvanced: Delauney triangulation\n\nInput / Output\n\nText: WKT, GML, GeoJSON, ...\n\nBinary: WKB\n\nIntegration: Shapefile, Oracle SDO, ...\n\nHigh-precision arithmetic\n\nComputational stability backed by an extensive test suite and 17 years of development and refinement."
