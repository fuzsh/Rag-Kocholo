        "text": "JSTS Topology Suite\n\nThe JSTS Topology Suite is a JavaScript library of spatial predicates and functions for processing geometry conforming to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published by the Open Geospatial Consortium. JSTS Topology Suite is also a JavaScript port of the well established Java library JTS Topology Suite with a built in parser for OpenLayers geometries.\n\nSWECO Position AB (my current employer) has gratiously provided sponsoring for this project.\n\nThe primary goal of the project is to provide OpenLayers applications with a complete library for processing and analysing simple geometries, but as of version 0.11.0 hard dependencies to OpenLayers was removed which makes it possible to use JSTS Topology Suite as a free standing geometry library.\n\nA Google group is available for developer discussions.\n\nUnit tests are made using the Jasmine testing framework. A port of JTS Validation Suite provides additional tests.\n\nA recent trunk snapshot of API docs is available. Also available are simple example use of buffer, overlay and triangulation operations. The examples uses a build of attache-array-js to meet JavaScript ES5 requirements in some browsers.\n\nThe code tries to be conformant to the Google JavaScript Style Guide and JSLint and is licensed with the LGPL 2.1 license.\n\nDevelopment environment\n\nEclipse 3.6 (Helios) using custom builders to check and enforce the Google JavaScript Style Guide and JSLint\n\nCustom builders requirements:\n\nInstalled Closure Linter from http://code.google.com/closure/utilities\n\nCompiled 'shell' sample from V8 JavaScript Engine (http://code.google.com/apis/v8) in /tools\n\nExternal JavaScript jslint.js and json2.js from https://github.com/douglascrockford in /tools\n\nAssumes OpenLayers 2.12 distribution in project root from http://www.openlayers.org/\n\nAssumes OS Ubuntu/Linux\n\nDesign changes\n\nThese are effective/potential changes from the original JTS Topology Suite:\n\nSkip abstracted CoordinateSequence interface/implementation\n\nJSTS in use"
