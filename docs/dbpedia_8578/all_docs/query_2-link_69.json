        "text": "JTS Topology Suite (Java Topology Suite) is an open-source Java software library that provides an object model for Euclidean planar linear geometry together with a set of fundamental geometric functions. JTS is primarily intended to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics software such as geographical information systems.[2] It can also be used as a general-purpose library providing algorithms in computational geometry.[3]\n\nJTS implements the geometry model and API defined in the OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL. JTS defines a standards-compliant geometry system for building spatial applications; examples include viewers, spatial query processors, and tools for performing data validation, cleaning and integration.\n\nIn addition to the Java library, the foundations of JTS and selected functions are maintained in a C++ port, for use in C-style linking on all major operating systems, in the form of the GEOS software library.\n\nUp to JTS 1.14, and the GEOS port, are published under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).\n\nWith the LocationTech adoption future releases will be under the EPL/BSD licenses."
