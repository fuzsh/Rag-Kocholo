        "text": "Lots of geospatial data has been collected within the last decades due to advances in digital spatial data capturing technologies and this has brought in different versions of the same data sets. Although various spatial and mapping organizations are updating and revising geospatial databases with new data/information about our rapidly changing environment; there are challenges of how to effectively and quickly update and adjust the geometries so that there are no sliver and dangling issues as a result of opening and overlaps due to variation between different versions of same data. This is vital in geospatial data updating and management in geosystems and databases. The paper describes an approach of geospatial geometry updating and adjustment basing on paradigm of point as being the simplest and smallest spatial primitive to handle and that it can be manipulated to define all geospatial data elements. It integrates methodologies from both earth sciences and computer science. Every...\n\nDuring the last ten years, increasing efforts were made to improve and simplify the process from Computer Aided Design (CAD) modeling to a numerical simulation. It has been shown that the transition from one model to another, i.e. the meshing, is a bottle-neck. Several approaches have been developed to overcome this time-consuming step, e.g. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which applies the shape functions used for the geometry description (typically B-Splines and NURBS) directly to the numerical analysis. In contrast to IGA, which deals with boundary represented models (B-Rep), our approach focuses on parametric volumetric models such as Constructive Solid Geometries (CSG). These models have several advantages, as their geometry description is inherently watertight and they provide a description of the models’ interior. To be able to use the explicit mathematical description of these models, we employ the Finite Cell Method (FCM). Herein, the only necessary input is a reliable stateme...\n\nOver the past decades, two major software libraries that support a wide range of geometric computing have been developed: Leda, the Library of Efficient Data Types and Algorithms, and Cgal, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. We start with an introduction of common aspects of both libraries and major differences. We continue with sections that describe each library in detail. Both libraries are written in C++. Leda is based on the object-oriented paradigm and Cgal is based on the generic programming paradigm. They provide a collection of flexible, efficient, and correct software components for computational geometry. Users should be able to easily include existing functionality into their programs. Additionally, both libraries have been designed to serve as platforms for the implementation of new algorithms. Correctness is of crucial importance for a library, even more so in the case of geometric algorithms where correctness is harder to achieve than in other areas of sof...\n\nA solid model (or simply a solid) is a digital representation of the shape of an existing or envisioned rigid object. Solids are routinely used in many applications, including architecture, entertainment, and health care. In particular, they play a major role in the manufacturing industries, where precise models of parts and assemblies are created using a solid modeler���a computer program that provides facilities for designing, storing, manipulating, and visualizing assemblies of solids."
