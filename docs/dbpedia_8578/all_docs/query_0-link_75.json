        "text": "The GeoTools team is pleased to share the availability GeoTools 24-RC :\n\nThis release candidate is also available from the OSGeo Maven Repository and is made in conjunction with GeoServer 2.18-RC and JTS 1.17.1.\n\nPlease Test this Release Candidate\n\nA release candidate is your chance to both try out new features and contribute to the project with valuable feedback right when we need it most.\n\nThis release is an easy upgrade with only API additions! Please test this release and let us know of any regression before we release GeoTools 24 later this month\n\nVisuals and Rendering\n\nNew capabilities have been added:\n\nAdd a ProjectionHandler for Homolosine\n\nWrappingProjectionHandler can now handle a rotated polar fitted Coordinate System\n\nImplement Polyconic spherical case (as used by US Census TIGER dataset)\n\nAdd functionality to GeoPackage with GeoPkgExtension\n\nRead/write support of GeoPackage has been available as a GeoTools DataStore for some time, this release Andrea (GeoSolutions) has really upped our game defining a GeoPkgExtension for modules to hook in and provide additional functionality:\n\nGeoPkgMetadataExtension: Supports the GeoPackage metadata extension, defined as a \"registered extension\" in the GeoPackage standard .\n\nGeoPkgSchemaExtension: Allowing to declare more information about columns and eventually express constraints on them.\n\nThis approach is already opening up a host of possibilities, with GeoServer experimenting with including styling and semantic annotations.\n\nThe GeoPackage module is under active development with new support for Support compact enumerations, speed improvements when adding content, and\n\nMapbox Style Dynamic Expressions\n\nThe MBStyle Extension continues to be improved with this release adding support for dynamic expressions.\n\nExpressions allow Mapbox Style to dynamically style features using attribute values ( [ \"get\",\"attribute\"] ), and respond to changes of scale ( [\"zoom\"] ), and make use of functions ( [\"rgb\",255,0,0] ):\n\n{ \"circle-radius\": [ \"interpolate\", [\"linear\"], [\"zoom\"], 0, [\"get\", \"rating\"], 10, [\"*\", 4, [\"get\", \"rating\"]] ] }\n\nThe previous, now deprecated, function stop approach remains supported:\n\n{ \"circle-color\": { \"property\": \"temperature\", \"stops\": [[0, 'blue'],[100, 'red']] } }\n\nThanks to Jody (GeoCat) for this improvement offering greater Mapbox.GL parity. For more information see user guide on Expressions .\n\nUpdated Libraries\n\nEach major release is an opportunity to update the libraries that GeoTools uses:\n\nBump no.ecc.java-vector-tiles to 1.3.10\n\nRemove un-maintained ogr-bridj module\n\nUpdate to JSR-385 units 2.0\n\nUpdate to Oracle 19.7.0.0 JDBC driver (now available as maven dependency)\n\nUpgrade FlatGeobuf library to 3.3.0\n\nUpgrade from Apache Commons Collections v3 to Apache Commons Collections v4\n\nUpgrade NetCDF to 4.6.15\n\nUpdate to SQL Server 8.2.2.jre8 driver\n\nUpgrade SnakeYAML to 1.26\n\nUpgrade to JTS Topology Suite 1.17.1\n\nUpgrade to sqlite-jdbc 3.31.1\n\nUpgrade to jgridshift 1.3\n\nPlease note if you have made use of the JSR-385 units library change your imports from \"import tec.uom.se.*\" to \"import tech.units.indriya.*\". For additional information on upgrading your application see our User Manual \"upgrading\" page.\n\nImprovements and Fixes\n\nPublic service announcement:\n\nThe imagemosaic-jdbc module (storing rasters in the database) does not have an active developer and has been downgraded to unsupported status.\n\nThe unmaintained ogr-bridj module has been removed.\n\nFrom our issue tracker release-notes:\n\nNew array function to allow literal array creation\n\nAdd support for restricting an attribute to a fixed set of valid values\n\nRendering speed improved with MemoryFilterOptimizer converting slow OR expressions into faster IN functions when possible.\n\nFix for SAP-HANA-datastore when working with views and no SRID found\n\nPostGIS datastore option to simplify using ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology function\n\nShapefile now supports Charset coding in the DBF file header, so attribute names are no longer restricted to \"iso-8859-1\" names.\n\nIan Turton fixed a very frustrating Shapefile java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.ByteBuffer.clear() error when working with Java 11\n\nChange to user-agent \"Geotools HTTP client\" to restore programatic access OSM tiles\n\nWMTS client support for longitude first coordinate reference systems\n\nA fix for OracleDatastore allowing use of reserved words as column names\n\nResearch and Development Updates\n\nOur \"unsupported\" module area is provided for the developer community to collaborate on research and development. We invite developers to contribute to the following work-in-progress:\n\nA new DataStore to access ogc-api features\n\nA new module supporting Esri compact cache TPK format\n\nElasticGeo continutes to improve with support for aliasing / short names,\n\nFor additional topics check out the \"unsupported\" page in our User guide.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to these modules, or starting your own research and development activity, please see our developers guide for details.\n\nAbout GeoTools 24 Series"
