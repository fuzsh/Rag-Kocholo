        "text": "The JTS Topology Suite is a Java API that implements a core set of spatial data operations using an explicit precision model and robust geometric algorithms. JTS is intended to be used in the development of applications that support the validation, cleaning, integration and querying of spatial datasets. This document is the design specification for the classes, methods and algorithms implemented in the JTS Topology Suite.\n\nJTS attempts to implement the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification (SFS) as accurately as possible. In some cases the SFS is unclear or omits a specification; in this case JTS attempts to choose a reasonable and consistent alternative. Differences from and elaborations of the SFS are documented in this specification\n\nIt has the following design goals:\n\nJTS conforms to the Simple Features Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS Consortium\n\nJTS provides a complete, consistent, robust implementation of fundamental 2D spatial algorithms\n\nJTS is fast enough for production use\n\nJTS is written in 100% pure Java\n\nJTS is open source (under the LGPL license)\n\nHomepage"
