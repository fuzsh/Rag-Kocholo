        "text": "He was fired from his first movie, \"Murder Inc.\", roughly half-way through its shooting schedule. Peter Falk, who won an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film, claimed that he never understood what caused this, implying that he and the other actors considered it most unfair.\n\nRosenberg studied Irish literature at New York University. Worked as a part-time teacher, while learning the art of editing in grad school. Entered films as editor and subsequently director in early 1950's television. Became noted as a competent director of numerous segments of such popular series such as \"The Naked City\", \"The Defenders\" and \"The Untouchables\". His feature films have been diverse in genre and variable in quality, ranging from prison dramas, arguably, his best work: Der Unbeugsame (1967) and Brubaker (1980)) to romantic comedy, Ein Frosch in Manhattan (1969) and, less effectively, from thrillers, Unter Wasser stirbt man nicht (1975), to horror Amityville Horror (1979)."
