Viewer Discretion is Advised.\n\nThe legendary and iconic Berwyn/Chicago-based classic mammoth monster masterpiece film host will present his big coast-to-coast broadcast premiere of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970); this Sat., Oct. 29 at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central on Me-TV.\n\nSven’s upcoming big Me-TV broadcast premiere of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970) & upcoming big broadcast of “Sventoonie” will be featured in the fifth installment in Sven’s Saturday October “Halloween ‘BOO’nanza” month-long festival on the airlanes of Me-TV and will also mark the finale in Sven’s month-long/October “Halloween ‘BOO’nanza” finale, along with Sun. afternoon re-showing of “Svengoolie; Uncrypted” and a Sun. afternoon Sven-hosted festival of the classic mammoth Universal mystery-supernatural adaptation series, “Kolchak: The Night Stalker.” -C.H.\n\nThe classic mammoth 1970 vampire monster masterpiece production was directed by veteran feature film actor-turned-feature film & TV director Bob Kelljan. One of Kelljan’s earliest acting appearances was in an episode of Alfred Hitchcock‘s classic mammoth MCA-Universal (Revue) TV mystery anthology series, “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” (in the 1960 episode “Forty Detectives Later” with James Franciscus and Jack Weston). Kelljan also wrote the screenplay for his classic mammoth 1970 American-International monster-vampire masterpiece production of “Count Yorga, Vampire.”\n\nKelljan’s production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970) was released theatrically through Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson’s American-International Pictures. Nine years after the original theatrical release of “Count Yorga, Vampire;” Arkoff sold American-International Pictures to television and feature film production/syndication company Filmways in 1979, which was later acquired by Orion Pictures in 1982. Orion, along with the majority of the American-International (AIP)/Filmways holdings was then sold to the present incarnation of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1997. Inspired by MGM’s recent revival of the “Orion Pictures” moniker, the modern incarnation of MGM recently revived the “American-International Pictures” (AIP) moniker for certain theatrical releases/theatrical feature film productions.\n\nOne year before working on “Count Yorga, Vampire;” Kelljan previously appeared in the role of Arthur in Richard Rush‘s classic mammoth American-International psychedelic drama masterpiece production of “Psych-Out” (1968) with Susan Strasberg, Dean Stockwell, young Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Adam Roarke, Max Julien young Garry Marshall, and The Strawberry Alarm Clock; “Psych-Out” was co-produced by disc jockey and TV host Dick Clark (of “American Bandstand” fame). Kelljan later directed the classic mammoth American-International vampire masterpiece production sequel to William Crain‘s earlier classic mammoth 1972 American-International vampire masterpiece production of “Blacula;” titled “Scream, Blacula Scream” (1973) with William Marshall (who later portrayed the “King of Cartoons” with Paul “Pee-Wee Herman” Reubens in Reubens/Herman’s classic mammoth CBS Saturday Morning masterpiece series, “Pee-Wee’s Playhouse” from 1987-90), Pam Grier, Barbara Rhoades, Lynne Moody, Bernie Hamilton, Bob Minor, Don Mitchell and Michael Conrad and later directed eight episodes of the classic mammoth Aaron Spelling–Leonard Goldberg/ABC television action-detective masterpiece series; “Starsky & Hutch” (Kelljan worked on the series from 1975-78).\n\nVeteran actor Michael Macready served as the producer for Kelljan’s classic mammoth 1970 American-International vampire monster masterpiece production during his brief producing career alongside his acting career.\n\nWho was in Bob Kelljan’s classic mammoth American-International vampire masterpiece production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970)?\n\nThe players who appeared in Bob Kelljan’s classic mammoth 1970 American-International vampire masterpiece production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” were Robert Quarry (as Count Yorga), Roger Perry (as Dr. James “Jim” Hayes), Michael Murphy (as Paul), a cameo by co-producer Michael Macready (as Michael “Mike” Thompson), Donna Anders (as Donna), Judy Lang (as Erica Landers), Edward Walsh (as Brudah), Julie Conners (as Cleo), Paul Hansen (as Peter), Sybil Scotford (as Judy), Marsha Jordan (as Donna’s Mother), Deborah Darnell (as a Vampire Woman), George Macready (as the narrator), Erica Macready (in an uncredited role as Babette), Mark Tapscott (in an uncredited role as a seance guest) and Stella Thomas (as a Vampire Woman).\n\nEarly in his acting career, Robert Quarry appeared in an uncredited role of a teenager in Alfred Hitchcock‘s classic mammoth Universal Studios mystery-suspense masterpiece production with Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotten (of Orson Welles’ “Citizen Kane” fame), Macdonald Carey, Henry Travers (of 1933’s “The Invisible Man,” 1941’s “Ball of Fire,” 1945’s “The Bells of St. Mary’s” and 1946’s “It’s A Wonderful Life” fame), Hume Cronyn, Patricia Collinge and Irving Bacon; “Shadow of a Doubt” (1943).

Kelljan’s original idea did not sit well with Arkoff and Nicholson’s American-International.\n\nIt was reported that several American-International preview release prints of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1971) still contained the “Count Iorga, Vampire” title. When Rober Quarry was cast for the role of the title role Vampire, both Kelljan and Macready decided to drop the graphic exploitation elements and make a traditional monster/vampire film for Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson’s American-International Pictures.\n\nRobert Quarry: American-International’s newest horror/monster feature film superstar at the time of the production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970)\n\nDuring the production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970); it was reported that Robert Quarry was one of American-International’s newest horror/monster feature film superstars during Kelljan’s classic mammoth vampire masterpiece production.\n\nAccording to a brief segment with veteran film historian/author Kim Newman from Arrow Video’s online advertisement for “The Count Yorga Collection” Blu-Ray box set, he noted that when Quarry was given an American-International feature film contract from Arkoff and Nicholson’s firm; it wasn’t an ordinary American-International feature film contract; the contract had the same conditions as the American-International film contract for the legendary Vincent Price for his numerous appearances in Arkoff and Nicholson’s feature film releases. He was being groomed as the “new Vincent Price” of American-International Pictures.\n\nRobert Quarry/Count Yorga’s “Fangs” for “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970)\n\nAccording to the American Film Institute (AFI)’s database article entry on Kelljan’s classic mammoth 1970 vampire monster masterpiece production for American-International; it was reported that Kelljan hired a local Los Angeles, California Dentist for the production of “Count Yorga, Vampire.” The reasoning for this was that the Dentist was a major aficionado of horror and monster feature films and Kelljan thought that he would be a perfect fit for his production of “Count Yorga, Vampire.”\n\nIn exchange, the Dentist created a series of custom Vampire “Fang” dental applications for Roberrt Quarry’s characterization of Count Yorga.\n\nBob Kelljan’s American-International production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970): Filmed on an economical budget\n\nAccording to additional details from Jeff Stafford’s 2007 TCM online article on Kelljan’s classic mammoth American-International vampire feature film masterpiece production of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970); the feature production was filmed on a tight budget.

Arkoff and James Nicholson’s American-International.\n\nThe majority of the scenes for Robert Quarry’s title characterization for the character of Count Yorga in Kelljan’s 1970 production were filmed in the evening as part of a contract clause for Quarry. It was reported that Quarry’s “Count Yorga” scenes were filmed in the evening as he spent the majority of the day appearing in another feature film that was filmed by a rival studio around the same time that Count Yorga was in production. The other film that Quarry appeared in that same year was in the role of Noonan in Stuart Rosenberg‘s Paramount Pictures production of “WUSA” (1970)* with Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Anthony Perkins (of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” fame), Laurence Harvey, Pat Hingle, Bruce Cabot, a-pre “Mary Tyler Moore Show” and a pre-“Young Frankenstein” Cloris Leachman and a pre-“M*A*S*H” Wayne Rogers.\n\n*Sidebar: “WUSA” (1970) is not connected to the CBS television affiliate in the Washington, D.C./Frederick, Maryland region; Channel 9/W*USA (which has held the “W*USA” call sign since 1986; originally named for then-owner Gannett’s “USA Today” newspaper). -C.H.\n\nAmerican-International’s promotion for “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970) via radio spots\n\nAccording to a rare 45 r.p.m. recording that was unearthed on Discogs, American-International Pictures sent out promotional radio spots to local radio stations from coast-to-coast on 45 r.p.m. single discs for disc jockeys/broadcasters to play in-between commercial breaks for their music programs/radio programs for their local town and the cinema that showcased the classic mammoth Bob Kelljan/American-International vampire masterpiece production of “Count, Yorga Vampire.”\n\nThe promotional spot radio ads for “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970) on the American-International 45 r.p.m. single were offered in 60-second and 30-second versions. Disc jockeys/broadcasters/personalities were also given the name of the cinema(s) that were showcasing “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970) for the live script copy at the end of the spot recordings.\n\nAround this time, American-International also had their own record label, American-International Records (a.ka. “AiR” Records by the time that “Count Yorga, Vampire” was released); which was one of two brief recorded music imprints that American-International established to compliment their feature film operations, beginning in 1959-60 and from 1970–79; according to Discogs.\n\nOne year after the original theatrical release of American-International’s “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970): A sequel\n\nOne year after the original American-International theatrical release of “Count Yorga, Vampire” (1970); Bob Kelljan was asked by American-International to produce a sequel, titled “The Return of Count Yorga” (1971); according to additional details from the American Film Institute article.
