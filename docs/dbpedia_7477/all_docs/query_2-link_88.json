        "text": "Back to Top\n\nMovies & TV Shows About Radio\n\nWhile much media today is self-referential (a frequent critique about today's movies), there actually aren't that many movies about radio. There are a few in which radio is a major part of the plot and others in which it's only secondary to the plot, but it's still fun to see how radio is represented in the movies.\n\nHere's a list of the movies and TV series about radio that we remember -- feel free to post your favorites on the Greetings Board if you remember others.\n\nDisc Jockey (1951)\n\nDirected by Will Jason. Written by Clarke Reynolds\n\nGinny Simms, Jane Nigh, Tom Drake, Lenny Kent, Michael O'Shea and Jerome Cowan.\n\nwith performers Tommy Dorsey, George Shearing, Sarah Vaughan, Herb Jeffries, Nick Lucas, The Weavers, Jack Fina, Vido Musso, Red Nichols, Red Norvo, Ben Pollack, Joe Venuti, Foy Willing, and Riders of the Purple Sage playing themselves.\n\nDJ's include: Martin Block, Joe Adams, Joe Allison, Bill Anson, Doug Arthur, Don Bell, Paul Brenner, Bob Clayton, Paul Dixon, Ed Gallagher, Dick Gilbert, Bill Gordon, Maurice Hart, Bruce Hayes, Eddie Hubbard, Bea Kalmus, Lea Malloy, Paul Masterson, Ed McKenzie, Tom Mercein, Gill Newsome, Gene Norman, Art Pallans, Bob Poole, Norm Prescott, Fred Robbins, Ernie Simon, and Larry Wilson\n\nA musical review\n\nRock Around The Clock (1956)\n\nDirected by Fred F. Sears. Story by James B. Gordon and Robert E. Kent.\n\nAlan Freed, Bill Haley & the Comets, Tony Williams & the Platters, Tony Martinez, Freddie Bell, Johnny Johnston, Alix Talton, Lisa Gaye, John Archer, Henry Slate, Earl Barton.\n\nA fictionalized story about the discovery of rock 'n' roll. Johnny Johnston (not be confused with Johnny Johnson, who discovered Chuck Berry), who was a leading man in movie musicals of the 1940s, such as Mardi Gras and Showboat Serenade plays Steve Hollis who visits a small town and \"discovers\" Bill Haley and the Comets. Songwriter Ernie Maresca (\"Runaround Sue\", \"Shout, Shout, Knock Yourself Out\") plays himself.\n\nDon't Knock The Rock (1956)\n\nDirected by Fred F. Sears. Story and Screenplay by Robert E. Kent .\n\nAlan Freed, Alan Dale, Patricia Hardy, Fay Baker, Jana Lund, Pierre Watkin with Bill Haley & the Comets, Dave Appell, the Applejacks, The Treniers and Little Richard.\n\nAlan Dale plays Arnie Haynes, a performer who returns home to adoring fans but must confront adults who think Rock 'n' Roll will turn their kids into juvenile delinquents. Alan Freed and Bill Haley help him out.\n\nI was only six years old when this came out, but I remember seeing it. Maybe there was a revival a few years later.\n\nThe Girl Can't Help It (1956)\n\nDirected by Frank Tashlin. Screenplay by Frank Tashlin and Herbert Baker from a novel by Garson Kanin.\n\nTom Ewell, Jayne Mansfield, Edmond O'Brien, Barry Gordon, Henry Jones, John Emery.\n\nwith musical performances by Julie London, Fats Domino, The Platters, Little Richard and his Band, Gene Vincent and his Blue Flames, The Treniers, Eddie Fontaine, The Chuckles, Abbey Lincoln and Johnny Olenn.\n\nNot a DJ film per se, but included becasue of the rock artists included and the impact the film had on rock 'n roll fans. The plot, about a down-and-out mobster who hires an alcoholic press agent to make his blonde bombshell girlfriend a recording star is trivial, but the performances are great. This film reportedly heavily influenced John Lennon, who saw the film in the summer of 1957 and Paul McCartney.\n\nRock Rock Rock! (1956)\n\nDirected by Will Price. Screenplay by Milton Subotsky from a story by Subotsky and Phyllis Coe.\n\nAlan Freed, Fran Manfred, Tuesday Weld, Teddy Randazzo, Jacqueline Kerr, Ivy Schulman.\n\nwith musical performances by The Moonglows, Chuck Berry, The Flamingos, Jimmy Cavallo and the House Rockers, The Johnny Burnette Trio, La Vern Baker, Cirino and the Bowties, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers and The Coney Island Kids.\n\nIMDB says the plot is \"a young teenage girl desperately tries to earn enough money to buy a dress for a school dance.\" Well, at least she doesn't have vampire problems. IMDB also claims that Yvette Mimieux (The Time Machine) was in the film, that Connie Francis did some unredited singing and that Valerie Harper (Rhoda) appeared in the film. The incredibly beautiful Tuesday Weld would go on to a regular role in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis TV series.\n\nMister Rock and Roll (1957)\n\nDirected by Charles S. Dubin. Written by James Blumgarten\n\nAlan Freed, Teddy Randazzo, Lois O'Brien, Rocky Graziano, Jay Barney, Al Fisher, Lou Marks, Leo Wirtz, Ralph Stanley\n\nwith performances by Lionel Hampton and his Band, Ferlin Husky, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, Little Richard, Brook Benton, Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, La Vern Baker, Shaye Cogan, Screamin' Jay Hawkins\n\nWhat a cast! Freed supposedly \"tells\" the story of Rock 'n' Roll. Randazzo wrote lots of hits for Little Anthony including \"Goin' Out of My Head\" and \"Hurt So Bad\". Director Dubin would go on to direct many TV episodes of Mash, Hawaii Five-O, Kojak and Roots: The Next Generation.\n\nGo, Johnny, Go! (1959)\n\nDirected by Paul Landres. Written by Gary Alexander\n\nAlan Freed, Jimmy Clanton, Sandy Stewart, Herb Vigran, Frank Wilcox, Barbara Woodell, Milton Frome, William Fawcett\n\nwith performances by Chuck Berry, Jackie Wilson, Ritchie Valens, The Cadillacs, Jo Ann Campbell, Harvey Fuqua and the Flamingos, Eddie Cochran, Jimmy Cavallo and the House Rockers\n\nFreed plays a promoter who holds a talent search contest and must find the winner, Jimmy Clanton, who doesn't know he's won. This was the last of the Freed rock movies. Fawcett, who had a Ph.D., became a TV actor, mainly in westerns like Maverick, Wagon Train, Laramie, Bonanza, etc.\n\nI saw this one a few years ago -- it's cheaply made but the print is in amazing shape, so it really looks great.\n\nYou Are What You Eat (1968)\n\nDirected by Barry Feinstein\n\nFeatured in the film are (or the music of): Paul Butterfield, David Crosby, Dave Dixon, John Herald, Sharmagne Leland-St. John, Barry McGuire, Rosko, John Simon, Tiny Tim, Peter Yarrow, Frank Zappa, The Electric Flag, Harper's Bizarre\n\nA stream-of-consciousness documentary of sorts. We've included it only because WNEW-FM's Rosko (Bill Mercer) is in it, though we're not sure if you actually see him or whether you only hear his voice.\n\nPhil Ramone was an associate producer of this movie. Feinstein was also a cinematographer on Monterey Pop, released in the same year. He was married to Carol Wayne, the blonde who often appeared on The Johnny Carson Show. I thought she was in this movie, but she's not listed in any of the online credits and the film is not listed in her credits. But I bet she is actually in the film.\n\nWUSA (1970)\n\nDirected by Stuart Rosenberg. Novel and Screenplay by Robert Stone.\n\nPaul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Anthony Perkins, Laurence Harvey, Pat Hingle, Bruce Cabot, Cloris Leachman, Moses Gunn, Wayne Rogers, Feoff Edwards.\n\nNewman plays a drifter who gets a job as an announcer for right-wing radio station WUSA, New Orleans. Woodward plays a \"whore with a heart of gold\" who tries to get him to change his detached stance. The station eventually becomes embroiled in a right-wing conspiracy to discredit welfare.\n\nGot terrible reviews when it was released, but has a great cast. Anthony Perkins was of course, made famous by Psycho, Bruce Cabot was in the original King Kong and Wayne Rogers would go on to co-star in the TV version of M*A*S*H.\n\nPlay Misty For Me (1971)\n\nDirected by Clint Eastwood. Story by Jo Heims. Screenplay by Jo Heims and Dean Riesner\n\nClint Eastwood, Jessica Walter, Donna Mills, Don Siegel\n\nAlso appearing: Cannonball Adderly and Johnny Otis\n\nJessica Walter stalks DJ Clint Eastwood. This was Eastwood's second directing effort. Don Seigel, who directed Dirty Harry, appears in the film.\n\nVanishing Point (1971)\n\nDirected by Richard C. Sarafian. Screenplay by Guillermo Cain\n\nBarry Newman, Cleavon Little, Dean Jagger, Charlotte Rampling.\n\nFeatures Bonnie & Delaney Bramlett as themselves with an uncredited Rita Coolidge.\n\nJust another car chase movie except that Newman is guided through the chase by blind radio DJ Cleavon Little. Not a great movie, but worth seeing for the cast and for Delaney & Bonnie.\n\nThe King of Marvin Gardens (1972)\n\nDirected by Bob Rafelson. Screenplay by Jacob Brackman. Story by Bob Rafelson and Jacob Brackman.\n\nJack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Ellen Burstyn\n\nBruce Dern, the King of Marvin Gardens, lives on the Boardwalk and fronts for the Atlantic City local mob. A dreamer, he asks his brother, a radio talk show host played by Nicholson, to help him build his dream paradise on a Pacific Island.\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973)\n\nDirected by George Lucas. Written by George Lucas, Gloria Katz & Willard Huyck\n\nRichard Dreyfus, Ron Howard, Paul LeMat, Cindy Williams, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark,\n\nMackenzie Phillips, Wolfman Jack, Bo Hopkins, Harrison Ford\n\nA day in the life of teens in a pre-Beatles (1962) small California town accompanied by an early-60s soundtrack largely hosted by \"the mysterious\" Wolfman Jack, who is seen at his radio station towards the end of the film.\n\nThe film features an early pre-Star Wars Harrison Ford as well as short appearances by Suzanne Somers (as the \"blonde in the car\") and Johnny Weissmuller, Jr. The film made stars out of many of the performers, several of whom went on to long-running TV show gigs, except for Harrison Ford, who returned to carpentry or something.\n\nThe film was a surprise hit, budgeted at under $800,000 and earning almost $150 million ($737 million in 2010 dollars!)\n\nThe Night That Panicked America (1975)\n\nDirected by Joseph Sargent. Play (\"Invasion From Mars\") by Howard Koch. Story and screenplay by Nicholas Meyer. Teleplay by Anthony Wilson\n\nVic Morrow, Cliff De Young, Michael Constantine, Walter McGinn, Eileen Brennan, Meredith Baxter,\n\nTom Bosley, Will Geer, Paul Shenar, John Ritter, Casey Kasem, Ron Rifkin\n\nAn incredibly well done TV movie about Orson Welles and the \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast of 1939. In spite of an announcement several times during the broadcast that this was only a dramatic show, many who heard the broadcast thought it was real and some supposedly came close to taking their lives in panic. In retrospect, the show mirrored our fears about the war in Europe, which had just begun.\n\nOnce the broadcast starts, whether the film follows the action in the radio studio or the action in the streets, we hear the entire re-created broadcast. Paul Shenar was totally believable as Welles and many of the original Mercury Players appeared in the film, such as Will Geer (The Waltons). American Top 40 DJ Casey Kasem also plays one of the Mercury Players.\n\nOne highlight of the film is when it demonstrates how sound effects were produced during live radio broadcasts.\n\nThe film was a real treat and it should be re-broadcast on every Halloween, but for some reason, I don't think it's been shown since the original broadcast. It was nominated for an Emmy for Film Editing and Writing and won the Emmy for Film Sound Editing for a Special Program.\n\nAmerican Hot Wax (1978)\n\nDirected by Floyd Murtax. Written by John Kaye & Art Linson\n\nTim McIntire, Fran Drescher, Jay Leno, Laraine Newman\n\nwith musical peformers Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Kenny Vance\n\nwith appearances by Melanie Chartoff, Richard Perry and Cameron Crowe.\n\nAn under-appreciated film bio about Alan Freed with McIntire in the lead.\n\nLike most film bios, it played loose with the facts, but it still was emotionally accurate in terms of what rock meant to young people. McIntire was much younger looking than Freed and no attempt was made to make Berry, Lewis or Hawkins look like their 1950s selves, but their music performances are classic. Hawkins' performance of I Put A Spell On You is just as demeneted as the original studio recording, which Hawkins recorded in one take (and as legend has it, was totally drunk). Newman plays a young girl who produces a black vocal group and is an approximation of a Carole King archetype.\n\nNewman was a member of the original Saturday Night Live cast and Chartoff was a cast member of Fridays, an ABC show that was actually a lot more creative than SNL. Richard Perry is the famous record producer of Rod Stewart, Carly Simon and Ringo Starr. Cameron Crowe, who has a cameo as a delivery boy, is the Rolling Stone writer whose story was featured in Almost Famous.\n\nFM (1978)\n\nDirected by John A. Alonzo. Written by Ezra Sachs.\n\nMichael Brandon, Eileen Brennan, Alex Karras, Cleavon Little, Martin Mull, Cassie Yates, Norman Lloyd with Linda Ronstadt, Jimmy Buffet, REO Speedwagon and Tom Petty. Music by Steely Dan.\n\nHollywood's version of a hippie FM station and the battle between the staff and management. Brennan was terrific as \"Mother\", an older burnt-out female DJ. Cleavon Little had replaced Richard Pryor in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles a few years earlier. Four years later, Norman Lloyd went on to a long-term role on TV's St. Elsewhere hospital drama. As of 2016, he's still alive (at 101!) and was most recently in the Amy Schumer film, Trainwreck and is the oldest working Hollywood actor.\n\nWKRP In Cincinnati (TV 1978-1982)\n\nDirected by Rod Daniel, Will Mackenzie, Asaad Kelada, Linda Day and others.\n\nWritten by Hugh Wilson, Steve Marshall, Dan Guntzelman, Blake Hunter, Pete Torokvei, Steven Kampmann, Lissa Levin and others.\n\nGary Sandy, Gordon Jump, Howard Hesseman, Loni Anderson, Richard Sanders, Frank Bonner, Tim Reid and Jan Smithers.\n\nOriginally vilified by TV critics as \"crap in Cincinnati\", the show became a classic by its seventh episode when the station attempts a promotion to drop turkeys from a helicopter, which results in something akin to the Hindenberg disaster.\n\nWhile some of the characters were cartoonish, Hesseman nailed his role as a weary DJ, although his persona better fit the image of an FM, not AM, rock radio jock. Anderson was wonderful as the all-knowing very hot and overpaid secretary, Sanders was great as a ditsy news guy but Smithers was underused as the sweet girl-next-door type.\n\nBe aware that the original DVD version of this show contains almost no original music because of licensing issues with the tracks. The 2014 remastered edition contains about 80% of the original music.\n\nThe Warriors (1979)\n\nDirected by Walter Hill. Novel by Sol Yurick. Screenplay by David Shaber and Walter Hill.\n\nMichael Beck, James Remar, Dorsey Wright, Brian Tyler, David Harris, Lynne Thigpen\n\nThe Warriors, a Coney Island gang falsely accused of killing another gang's leader must make a perilous trip from The Bronx to Coney Island while being pursued by all the other gangs and the police. Lynne Thigpen plays a radio DJ who narrates the action.\n\nThe movie was supposed to represent a dystopian future of New York City and it certainly seemed like it might be the case when the movie was made. But now that the subway hardly contains graffiti anymore, crime is at the lowest rate in 40 years and it costs something like $35 to spend several hours in Coney Island's new Luna Park, which replaced Astroland, we can see that they got it completely wrong. But it's a fun film nonetheless.\n\nThis movie has become a cult favorite. Hill would go on to direct \"The Long Riders\" and \"48 Hrs.\" and he was a producer on \"Alien\", \"Aliens\" and the recent \"Prometheus\".\n\nThe Idolmaker (1980)\n\nDirected by Taylor Hackford. Written by Edward Di Lorenzo\n\nRay Sharkey, Tovah Feldshuh, Peter Gallgher, Joe Pantoliano, Maureen McCormick, Olympia Dukakis\n\nBased on the life of rock producer/promoter Bob Marucci, who discovered Frankie Avalon and Fabian. But how could they make a movie about Avalon and Fabian and not have someone playing Dick Clark in the movie?\n\nGood Morning Vietnam (1987)\n\nDirected by Barry Levinson. Written by Mitch Markowitz\n\nRobin Williams, Forest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby, Robert Wuhl, J.T. Walsh, Floyd Vivino and Danny Aiello\n\nRobin Williams as armed forces DJ Adrian Cronauer, who shakes things up while on tour in Vietnam. The usual humanist wild guy vs. the stiff brass comedy. The great Uncle Floyd (Vivino) had a small role. Williams was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nThe story was highly fictionalized as the actual Cronauer was a lifelong political conservative and had never been in conflict with his superiors. Cronauer later said that if he had done half the things Williams' character did in the film, he would have spent the rest of his life in military jail. But that wouldn't have made for a very good movie where there has to be conflict, and very obvious good guys and bad guys.\n\nI like to imagine other people in the lead role: perhaps Bill Murray or Steve Buscemi.\n\nRadio Days (1987)\n\nDirected and Written by Woody Allen\n\nDon Pardo, Julie Kavner, Wallace Shawn, Seth Green, Josh Mostel, Michael Tucker, Dianne Wiest, Kenneth Mars, Mia Farrow, Tito Puente, Larry David, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels, Kitty Carlisle,\n\nMercedes Ruehl, Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, William H. Macy\n\nand the voices of Jackson Beck, Gregg Almquist, Wendell Craig, Ken Roberts, Norman Rose and Kenneth Welsh.\n\nWoody Allen's masterpiece alternates between middle-class life in 1940's Rockaway Beach, NY, in which the radio accompanies almost all daily activities, and the upscale lives of the radio performers. The film rings emotionally true and includes the voices of many 1940s radio announcers who were still living when the film was made. Allen must have been going through some good times when he made this film as it's probably his most positive, uplifting film.\n\nI had the honor of working with several of the voice-over actors who appear in the film, including Jackson Beck, who recorded the original \"Dial-A-Santa\" campaign for the New York Telephone Company and Norman Rose, who had such a deep voice, he always claimed he gave himself a headache.\n\nThe film was nominated for two Oscars for best screenwriting and best set decoration.\n\nTalk Radio (1988)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone. Book by Stephen Singular. Based on the play by Eric Bogosian and Tad Savinar. Screenplay by Eric Bogosian and Oliver Stone.\n\nEric Bogosian, Ellen Greene, Leslie Hope, John C. McGinley, Alec Baldwin, John Pankow\n\nA brilliant but somewhat claustrophobic film based on Bogosian's play (which itself was based on the book \"Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg\") in which the audience is asked to sympathize with a self-destructive and cruel liberal talk-show host whose local talk show is about to be syndicated nationally. Bogosian's character can't seem to make up his mind whether he wants the money and power syndication will bring or whether he feels that he's selling out. (It almost sounds quaint - today everybody takes the money - if Berg had not been murdered, he'd probably be working for WABC radio or for FOX as a Conservative talk show host.)\n\nBogosian's character proves that \"liberal\" talk doesn't have to be boring, although I'm sure had the character survived, he'd now be taking Democrats to task as much as Conservatives - he was an equal opportunity offender who wasn't afraid to manipulate the truth for dramatic effect.\n\nThe real Alan Berg had passed the Illinois state bar exam at age 22, but experienced seizures and became an alcoholic. He eventually recovered and opened a clothing store in Denver. He appeared several times on Laurence Gross' show on KGMC. When Gross left to take a job in San Diego, Berg took over. He also did stints at KHOW, KWBZ and eventually KOA, where he worked until his death. Two members of a neo-Nazi group called The Order were sentenced to life terms on racketeering and conspiracy charges and for violating Berg's civil rights (but inexplicably not for murder). Berg's murder may have been inspired by The Turner Diaries.\n\nMidnight Caller (TV 1988-1991)\n\nCreated by Richard Di Leilo\n\nGary Cole, Dennis Dun, Arthur Taxier\n\nCole plays an ex-cop who accidentally killed his partner and has become a talk show host - one who gets personally involved with the problems of those who call his show.\n\nBad Channels (1992)\n\nDirected by Ted Nicolaou. Story by Charles Band. Screenplay by Jackson Barr.\n\nRobert Factor, Martha Quinn, Aaron Lustig\n\nAn alien takes over a radio station in order to capture human females and shrink them for his collection. Right. Factor and Lustig have done a lot of bit TV work. Quinn was the MTV video jockey.\n\nStraight Talk (1992)\n\nDirected by Barnet Kellman. Story by Carig Bolotin. Screenplay by raig Bolotin and Patricia Resnick.\n\nDolly Parton, James Woods, Griffin Dunne, Michael Madsen, John Sayles, Teri Hatcher, Spalding Gray, Jerry Orbach, Philip Bosco, Charles Fleischer, Jay Thomas\n\nDolly Parton moves to Chicago and becomes a radio talk show host. Not a great movie, but a great cast. At least Spalding Gray and Jay Thomas had actually worked in radio. Kellman was a TV director who had directed soap operas and episodes of Designing Women and Mad About You before making this movie and would go on to direct episodes of Murphy Brown and an episode of Alias.\n\nFrasier (TV 1993-2004)\n\nCreated by David Angell, Peter Casey & David Lee\n\nKelsey Grammer, Jane Leeves, David Hyde Pierce, Peri Gilpin, John Mahoney.\n\nGrammer plays a psychiatrist who never seems to practice psychiatry, but hosts a radio talk show. Great writing, but the character is never very convincing as a radio talk show host, although that wasn't the point of the show. Gilpin plays his producer. Gilpin's father was WOR-FM Drake-era DJ Jim O'Brien.\n\nSleepless in Seattle (1993)\n\nDirected by Nora Ephron. Story by Jeff Arch. Written by Nora Ephron, David S. Ward and Jeff Arch.\n\nTom Hanks, Ross Malinger, Rita Wilson, Victor Garber, Meg Ryan, Bill Pullman,\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce, Calvin Trillin, Rosie O'Donnell, Rob Reiner\n\nRomantic nonsense when a widowed man's kid calls a radio talk show in order to find his father a partner. But Meg Ryan is incredibly cute, if a bit too unbelieveably needy.\n\nCan you imagine this happening today? Who would the kid call - Howard Stern? Rush? Sean Hannity? Now that might make for a funny movie. Rush could set the father up with Michelle Malkin or Ann Coulter. Hilarity ensues when they find out Tom Hanks' character is a liberal. The kid cries when the romantic interest accuses Hanks' character of being a socialist. Howard Stern just wants to know Ann Coulter's bust size.\n\nNominated for 2 Oscars for Writing and Music.\n\nAirheads (1994)\n\nDirected by Michael Lehmann. Written by Rich Wilkes\n\nBrendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Michael McKean, Judd Nelson,\n\nErnie Hudson, Amy Locane, Nina Siemaszko, Marshall Bell, Reg E. Cathey, David Arquette, Michael Richards, Joe Mantegna\n\nA rock band kidnaps a radio station in order to get their music played. Another silly movie with a great cast. Richards was halfway through his Seinfeld run when this film was made. McKean had made Spinal Tap and Hudson had appeared in Ghostbusters ten years earlier.\n\nRadioland Murders (1994)\n\nDirected by Mel Smith. Story by George Lucas. Written by Willard Huyck & Gloria Katz and Jeff Reno & Ron Osborn.\n\nBrian Benben, Mary Stuart Masterson, Ned Beatty, George Burns, Michael Lerner, Michael McKean, Jeffrey Tambor, Christoper Lloyd, Larry Miller, Anita Morris, Corbin Bernsen, Rosemary Clooney,\n\nBobcat Goldthwait, Candy Clark, Bo Hopkins, Robert Klein, Harvey Korman and Peter MacNicol.\n\nHaven't seen this one, because I seem to remember it getting terrible reviews. Roger Ebert wrote, \"...the movie just doesn't work. It's all action and no character, all situation and no comedy.\" What do you expect from the people responsible for \"Howard the Duck\"?\n\nIt almost sounds like a Woody Allen story: in 1939, a fourth radio network premieres with a broadcast interrupted by a mysterious voice. Members of the cast soon show up dead.\n\nGreat cast, including Michael McKean (Spinal Tap), Jeffrey Tambor (Larry Sanders Show), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future, Taxi), Peter MacNicol (Ghostbusters II, Ally McBeal), stand-up comic Robert Klein and others. This was George Burns' last movie -- he was about 97 when the film was made.\n\nBye Bye Love (1995)\n\nDirected by Sam Weisman. Written by Gary David Goldberg and Brad Hall.\n\nMatthew Modine, Randy Quaid, Paul Reiser, Janeane Garofalo, Amy Brennerman,\n\nEliza Dushku, Ed Flanders, Rob Reiner\n\nA film about a bunch of friends who are either divorced, getting divorced or unable to commit. There's a subplot about a radio psychologist played by Rob Reiner whose comments about divorced men enrage Randy Quaid, who eventually appears on his show to set the record straight.\n\nThe film seems like one that might have been directed by Reiner or Ron Howard, although it makes life in California seem like one of luxury, emptiness and triviality at the same time. Do upper middle-class divorced men in California really all take their kids to McDonalds? How come all the divorced women in the film, most of whom have already had several kids each, are all still incredible looking? But Rob Reiner is pretty funny, if a bit unrealistic, as a touchy-feely talk radio show host.\n\nNews Radio (TV 1995-1999)\n\nCreated by Paul Simms. Directed by Tom Cherones and others.\n\nWritten by Paul Simms, Josh Lieb, Joe Furey, Lewis Morton, Brian Kelley, Sam Johnson, Chris Marcil, Drake Sather, Alan J. Higgins and others.\n\nDave Foley, Stephen Root, Andy Dick, Maura Tierney, Vicki Lewis, Joe Rogan, Phil Hartman, Khandi Alexander, Jon Lovitz.\n\nSeems straightforward, but the wacky cast and creative writing made this an interesting, if unrealistic, portrayal of an all-news radio station. Hartman had previously been on Saturday Night Live. Tierney would start a ten year run on E.R. upon completing this show.\n\nThe Truth About Cats and Dogs (1996)\n\nDirected by Michael Lehmann. Written by Audrey Wells\n\nUma Thurman, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Chaplin Jamie Fox\n\nGarofalo plays a veternarian and radio talk show host. Just exactly how many talk shows are there on the air today (or even back in 1996) about pet animals?\n\nIs it believeable that Ben Chaplin wants Garofalo more than Uma?\n\nThat Thing You Do (1996)\n\nDirected and written by Tom Hanks\n\nTom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Johnathon Schaech, Steve Zahn, Ethan Embry, Tom Hanks,\n\nCharlize Theron, Obba Babatunde, Giovanni Ribisi, Chris Ellis, Alex Rocco, Peter Scolari, Rita Wilson, Chris Isaak, Keven Pollak, Bill Cobbs.\n\nNot really about radio as much as about the rise and fall of an American pop group in 1964 in an alternate universe where the Beatles were an American group (if the early Beatles had only one hit song, ditsy members and if Ringo was the romantic lead and a jazz fanatic).\n\nRon Howard's brother Clint plays a DJ and director Jonathan Demme plays a director. Alex Rocco, who usually plays mobsters, has a short bit as an obnoxious record label executive who doesn't appear to know or care anything about the music. Little did they know how accurate that portrayal would soon be. Bill Cobbs is superb as a jazz pianist. A fun movie, although I spent most of it watching Liv Tyler (and surprisingly, disliking Charlize Theron's character).\n\nPrivate Parts (1997)\n\nDirected by Betty Thomas. Story by Howard Stern. Screenplay by Len Blum & Michael Kalesniko\n\nAs themselves: Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred Norris, Gary Dell'Abate, Jackie Martling, John Stamos, Chris Barron, Flavor Flav, M.C. Hammer, Ted Nugent, Ozzy Osbourne, John Popper, Slash, Renee Suran, Dee Snider and Tiny Tim.\n\nwith Mary McCormack, Paul Giamatti, Carol Alt, Allison Janney, Michael Murphy, Jenna Jameson\n\nHoward's story. Got great reviews when it was released because it made Howard look like a really nice guy and family man, although there's also a scene in the film where he's totally out of touch in regards to his wife's feelings and decent human behavior. I think Stern was brave to keep that incident in the film.\n\nThere's a great scene where the researchers at WNBC-AM are analyzing their research and ratings reports and discover that people who claim they hate Howard are listening even longer than people who like him because \"they want to see what happens next.\"\n\nGiamatti is great as the station executive who Howard tears to shreds on and off the air. Director Betty Thomas had directed a number of TV shows and The Brady Bunch Movie before this. She had also appeared on Hill Street Blues from 1981 to 1987.\n\nTelling Lies In America (1997)\n\nDirected by Guy Ferland. Written by Joe Eszterhas\n\nKevin Bacon, Brad Renfro, Maximilian Schell, Calista Flockhart,\n\nPaul Dooley, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Luke Wilson.\n\nA little seen and under-appreciated film about a top-40 DJ (Bacon) who befriends and manipulates a high school student and recent immigrant to facilitiate his payola collections. Back then, being a DJ outside of the biggest cities meant cruddy pay, spare change from doing record hops and personal appearances, and all the records and payola you could steal. (Note: before Congress got involved, payola was not illegal. But not paying taxes on the payola was illegal, which is how they got Allan Freed.)\n\nBut the story is also about the representation of \"cool\" America as top-40 radio and its appeal to outsiders in their zeal to merge into the melting pot and become truly American and whether that culture is one of lies or one of the truth. Great performances from everyone. You root for Bacon's DJ, but also hate him for his faults.\n\nRenfro previously worked with Bacon in the film Sleepers. He died at the young age of 25 from a drug overdose.\n\nMr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story (1999)\n\nDirected by Andy Wolk. Written by John A. Jackson (book) & Matt Dorff (teleplay)\n\nJudd Nelson, Madchen Amick, David Gianopoulos, Daniel Kash, Paula Abdul with Leon (as Jackie Wilson), James C. Victor (as Jerry Lee Lewis), Walter Franks (as Little Richard), Joe W. Davis (as Buddy Holly), Michael Dunston (as Bo Diddley), LeRoy D. Brazile (as Frankie Lymon), Michael Daingerfield (as Bill Haley) and Fabian and Bobby Rydell as themselves.\n\nA relatively low-budget TV movie. While the musical performers were quite good, Judd Nelson was not convincing as Alan Freed. Based on the book, \"Big Beat Heat: Alan Freed and the Early Years of Rock & Roll\".\n\nWhat no film has yet been able to recreate accurately is the atmosphere that Freed created on the radio. Listen to the Freed aircheck on the WINS page for a sample of \"rock and roll theatre of the mind\".\n\nA Prairie Home Companion (2006)\n\nDirected by Robert Altman. Story by Garrison Keillor & Ken LaZebnik. Screenplay by Garrison Keillor .\n\nWoody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Garrison Keillor, Kevin Kline, Lindsay Lohan, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, Maya Rudolph, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams.\n\nA fictional story about the cancelation of the \"A Prairie Home Companion\" radio show.\n\nTalk To Me (2007)\n\nDirected by Kasi Lemmons. Story by Michael Genet. Screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa.\n\nDon Cheadle, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McFee, Mike Epps, Peter MacNeill,\n\nAdam Gaudreau, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen\n\nThe \"true\" story of 1960s ex-con and Washington, D.C. air personality Ralph Waldo \"Petey\" Greene Jr., whose mantra was \"tell it like it is\" (although this was also Murray the K's and Aaron Neville's mantra) and who spoke to his listeners about race and power in America.\n\nThe Brave One (2007)\n\nDirected by Neil Jordan. Story by Roderick Taylor & Bruce A. Taylor. Screenplay by Roderick Taylor & Bruce A. Taylor and Cynthia Mort.\n\nJodie Foster, Terrence Howard, Nicky Katt, Naveen Andrews, Mary Steenburgen.\n\nJodie Foster plays a radio host who is brutally attacked and seeks revenge in a female version of Death Wish.\n\nCadillac Records (2008)\n\nDirected and written by Darnell Martin\n\nAdrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright, Gabrielle Union, Columbus Short, Cedric the Entertainer,\n\nEmmanuelle Chriqui, Eamonn Walker, Mos Def, Beyonce Knowles\n\nAlso not really a movie about radio, but rather about the music business, it purports to tell the story of Chess Records and its major mostly blues acts: Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Etta James.\n\nThe cast is really terrific and the relationships between the characters seem to reflect the historical record of what is known about them. The musical performances are incredible, supposedly mostly performed live and have not been heavily mixed for modern ears. Radio comes into play largely when Eric Bogosian, portraying Alan Freed, accepts payola from Leonard Chess.\n\nA terrific movie, but it does play loose with many specific facts. Here are just a few of the historical issues (warning: Spoilers ahead):\n\n- Leonard Chess originally bought an interest in Aristocrat records in 1947. In 1950 his brother Phil joined. (Phil isn't even mentioned in the film, but actually appears as the young man who introduces Leonard to Etta James, seeming to indicate that Phil was left on the cutting-room floor. This is much like how Neshui Ertegun was never mentioned in \"Ray\"). When Phil joined the company, they re-incorporated the company as Chess Records. The film makes it seem like Leonard created Chess records from scratch.\n\n- In the film, Muddy goes from a sharecropper shack to the streets of Chicago where he soon meets Chess. But in actuality, he moved to St. Louis in 1940, and then returned to Mississippi to run a juke joint before heading to Chicago in 1943. It was at least four years before he met Leonard Chess although Muddy's early recordings were released on Aristocrat.\n\n- The film shows Muddy heading to London for the first time after Chess was sold (to GRT) in 1969, but he first toured England in 1958, although it wasn't a success because the audience expected acoustic folk music.\n\n- The film never mentions Muddy's great success at the Newport Folk Festival in 1960.\n\n- The film implies that Leonard had only very young children at the time of his death, when in actuality, his 27 year-old son Marshall was running the company in 1969, just before the sale. Leonard was actually off running TV properties at this point.\n\n- Alan Freed (Eric Bogosian) is shown on the air during a time period when he was either serving time after the payola scandals or had disappeared from the scene because no one would hire him.\n\n- The great piano player Otis Spahn is never mentioned (although Hubert Sumlin as played by Albert Jones has a small part.)\n\n- Chess is portrayed as only being a blues label (Chuck Berry aside) with the five great stars. But Chess also had a great Jazz label with such artists as Ahmad Jamal, Ramsey Lewis, Sonny Stitt, Yusef Lateef and others and in the early 50's, it recorded vocal groups such as The Flamingos and The Moonglows, both of which had big hits (although they were covered by white artists, who had bigger hits.) In addition, Bo Diddley was left out of the movie (supposedly because another film is in the works about Diddley's life.)\n\n- Leonard Chess did not die as portrayed in the film, but several months later under less dramatic circumstances.\n\nWhile the affair between Chess and Etta James actually happened, the appealing actors were a lot more fun to watch than the actual participants would have been. Leonard Chess, even though he was only 52 when he died, actually looked very much like ex-NYC mayor Ed Koch, and Etta James was short and squat. When you look at photos of them, it's hard to imagine romance between them and Chess was more than 20 years senior.\n\nBut having said all that, Cadillac Records is still a great movie with great acting and musical performances and well worth seeing. Every major member of the cast is spectacular, but the standout for me was Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf, who simply exudes the danger and power of the man.\n\nPirate Radio (2009) aka The Boat That Rocked\n\nDirected and written by Richard Curtis\n\nMichael Hadley, Charlie Rowe, Lucy Fleming, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Sturridge,\n\nIan Mercer, Bill Nighy, Will Adamsdale, Tom Brooke, Rhys Darby, Nick Frost,\n\nKatherine Parkinson, Chris O'Dowd, Ike Hamilton, Stephen Moore, Kenneth Branagh\n\nMost Americans don't realize that in the early 1960s, it was almost impossible to hear rock music on the BBC and the BBC was the only game in town in England, unless one elected to listen to shortwave radio to pick up signals from other countries. In fact, rock was so limited on the BBC, that it's a miracle that the Beatles and other groups of that era were able to succeed. As a result, a number of pirate radio stations started broadcasting in international waters, including Radio Caroline, on which the film is very loosely based.\n\nThis film mixes a drop of fact and a lot of fantasy to make an extremely entertaining and enjoyable movie. There are some outstanding performances, including those of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the lone American DJ on board, Bill Nighy as the ship's captain and godfather of young Carl, who is sent to live on the boat after some trouble at school, and Kenneth Branagh as a officious government minister who perceives rock and roll as the end of civilization.\n\nOne of the more effective parts of the film is when it demonstrates how important radio was to the lives of its listeners.\n\nIn reality, Radio Caroline did not face the fate of the ship in the movie, but rather was towed away for non-payment of bills, but once again, confrontation makes for a much better movie drama. But the movie is still a lot of fun, even if most of it never happened. Most of the Radio Caroline DJs eventually worked at commercial radio or the BBC, but some have returned to a new non-profit Radio Caroline, mostly broadcasting on the web, in some cases donating their services.\n\nThe King's Speech (2010)\n\nDirected by Tom Hopper. Screenplay by David Seidler\n\nColin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Guy Pearce, Clare Bloom, Timothy Spall\n\nThis wonderful film tells the story of King George VI, who ascended the British throne when his brother Edward abdicated in December of 1936 to marry a divorced woman. But just as television played an incredibly important role in the ascension of John F. Kennedy to the presidency in 1960, radio was becoming ever more important a method of communication in the 1930s on the eve of World War II. King George VI, for a variety of reasons, had a stammer and this film tells the story of his relationship with a speech therapist, Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rust, who came to his aid. But it also demonstrates both the complexity and importance of radio communications at a time when a nation was about to plunge into the horror of a long war.\n\nIn a World... (2013)\n\nDirected by Lake Bell. Screenplay by Lake Bell\n\nLake Bell, Rob Corddry, Alexander Holden, Eva Longoria, Ken Marino, Demetri Martin, Fred Melamed, Tig Notaro, Nick Offerman, Michaela Watkins, Geena Davis, Stephanie Allynne.\n\nWhile radio doesn't play a direct role in this film, voice-over actors do. In a world where so many movies are about robots, aliens, unrealistic super heroes, stupidly violent villains, haunted houses and people who act in ways that one could never imagine any real human being behaving, \"In A World...\" is an incredibly refreshing adult, intelligent film that reminds one of the kinds of films François Truffaut used to make, if any of his films had a truly happy ending. In fact, one can imagine \"In A World...\" being the \"Day for Night\" of the Hollywood voice-over set.\n\nAdmittedly, I was pre-disposed to like this film since I worked with (New York) voice-over actors in a previous life.\n\nLake Bell, who has previously shown up in character parts on shows such as \"Boston Legal\", has proven herself a triple-threat: this film has a sharply written script, she has directed smart performances and Ms. Bell is a delight to watch and hear as she obviously has the talent to be the character she portrays. While most of the relationship bits are more mundane, they're somewhat more realistic than we're used to in most of today's films.\n\nOne of her character's most endearing attributes is the ability to imitate other people's voices, which she collects almost as a sociologist or archeologist would. I wish she had spent a bit more time in the film demonstrating these incredibly funny abilities, most of which already show up in the trailer.\n\nNow having said that, I must also say that when I worked in the industry, the voice-over actors who I worked with (which did include women even back in the 1970s and 80s, although men were definitely the majority) did not display the kind of ego-driven angst that the characters in this film elicit. But the stakes were lower - the people who I worked with were generally working on educational or corporate media and radio spots - not national TV spots for major $100-million-dollar motion pictures. There were some actors who were quite wealthy but would never take a vacation. They were afraid that if any client used a different talent in their absence that they would never get work from that client again. But I never sensed any real competition between them. That's not the case in this movie, but the competitive angst displayed is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDocumentaries About Radio\n\nHere are some great radio documentaries. More to come....\n\nAirplay: The Rise and Fall of Rock Radio (2008)\n\nDirected by Chris Fox Gilson and Carolyn Travis\n\nCasey Kasem, Cousin Brucie, Dan Ingram, Jerry Blavat, Dick Biondi, Jim Ladd, David Crosby, Raechel Donahue, Jocko Henderson, Graham Nash, Grace Slick, Martha Jean Steinberg, Leley Gore, Art Laboe, Scott Shannon, Rufus Thomas, Ben Fong Torres, Bob Weir, Jann Wenner, Pete Fornatale, Tom Donahue, Murray the K, Alan Freed, Meg Griffin, Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack\n\nA terrific documentary about rock radio and the personalities who created it, including its beginnings in the 1950s, the advent of top-40 radio, the emergence of FM and freeform radio and the era of consolidation and the future, including the impact of satellite radio.\n\nRadio Wars (2012)\n\nDirected by Sandra Mohr. Written by Mark Mallas, Sandra Mohr and Andy Montero\n\nBut Burrell, Tommy Calvert, Jr., Dominique Garcia, Richard Keane, Andy Montero, Spencer Osborne, Rick Phebus, Rob Potylo, Martine Rothblatt and Art Vuolo Jr.\n\nWe haven't seen this one, but IMDB describes it as “…a daring and unconventional look at the history of radio. From the pitched battles surrounding its invention to the secret fights for dominance between old and new media, radio has always been at war”.\n\nRadio Unnameable (2012)\n\nDirected by Paul Lovelace and Jessica Wolfson\n\nBob Fass, David Amram, Judy Collins, Robert Downey Sr., Marshall Efron, Arlo Guthrie, Larry Josephson, Paul Krassner, Judith Malina, Steve Post, Jerry Jeff Walker\n\nUnless you're Ken Burns, it's almost impossible today for serious independent filmmakers to get documentaries completed because it's so hard to obtain funding. There are a number of documentary projects of interest to us that have been underway for years, with no signs of completion. Unfortunately in the United States, most have to be abandoned.\n\nDirected by Paul Lovelace and Jessica Wolfson, RADIO UNNAMEABLE is a documentary film about legendary radio personality Bob Fass, who revolutionized the FM dial on listener supported New York station WBAI by serving as a cultural hub for music, politics and audience participation for nearly 50 years. Long before today's innovations in social media, Fass utilized the airwaves for mobilization, encouraging luminaries as well as ordinary listeners to talk openly and without commercial considerations, taking the program in surprising directions. RADIO UNNAMEABLE is a visual and aural collage that pulls from Bob Fass's immense archive of audio, film, photographs and video that has been sitting dormant until now.\n\nWhen Paul and Jessica contacted us over a year ago to see if we had any WBAI material, I had my doubts about the success of such an effort. After all, there aren't that many people interested in radio these days. Take those people and filter them down to those that care about New York radio. Then take those people and find the ones who still care about 1960s-70s radio. (Well...OK, those are the people who visit this site.) Now take those remaining and find the ones who care about Bob Fass and WBAI. I thought that number would be about nine (me being two of them).\n\nThen I thought that even if there was such interest, how much archival material, especially visual material, could possibly be available? After all, the peak of Fass' radio career took place in the 1960s and 70s, before the age of portable video.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong. This film has been selling out at the Film Forum. It is filled with wonderful visuals and audio. As it turns out, Fass saved about 7000 reels of tape from his shows. (Not the least bit organized or cataloged, but at least they were kept).\n\nThis film is about far more than one late-night radio personality. It's about a city, political and social movements, the best use of radio to get something positive accomplished, and how Fass (and a few others like him) created a comfortable environment for new artists to explore their art and present it to the public before the age of complete and crass commercialism. But it's also about how internal politics and the segmentation of political movements came together to destroy even the most utopian environments and the resulting fallout.\n\nWhile no commercial radio station was ever as free-form as Fass (and Steve Post) was on WBAI, it's easy to see the influence he had, especially on personalities like Vin Scelsa, who appears in the film. Also appearing is Judy Collins, the voice of Joni Mitchell, Paul Krassner, Steve Post, Abbie Hoffman, Marshall Efron, Dave Van Ronk and many other luminaries of the era.\n\nWe always knew there was a core of people who listened to WBAI, but I don't think many outsiders today believe it had all that much influence. The reality, as shown in the documentary, is that Fass could get thousands of people to show up for a \"Fly-In\" at Kennedy Airport or the equivalent of a flash-mob at Grand Central Station (which ended in violence) and many other such events.\n\nOne of the surprises of this documentary is that it's so damned entertaining - it's simply a delight to watch. It brings us back to a time of great social movements as well as silliness and excesses. But you walk away from this film thinking, \"Radio was really important then, wasn't it?\" And it mostly seems so trivial and unimportant now.\n\nListeners to his show were constantly trying to seek ways to help people. One woman called-in distraught because of an apartment fire. People called in offering her a free hotel room. Fass got listeners (or his \"cabal\", as he called it) together to clean the streets during a garbage strike. Fass himself kept a guy on the air who claimed to be in the process of committing suicide and saved his life. Can you imagine any radio station, commercial or non-commercial, that could accomplish these things today?\n\nYou can find more information on the film here: More info and links\n\nLa Maison de la Radio (2013)\n\nDirected and edited by Nicolas Philbert.\n\nJean-François Achilli, Evelyne Adam, Jean-Claude Ameisen, Arno, Alain Arnstamm, Pierre Bastien, Thomas Baumgarter, Sophie Becherel, Alexandre Besikian, Céline Bonhomme, Angélique Boulin, Alain Bédouet\n\nA day in the life of Radio France.\n\nI Am What I Play (2015)\n\nProduced and directed by Roger King\n\nMeg Griffin, David Marsden, Charles Laquidara, Pat O'Day\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the 1980s, the rock radio DJ played an unprecedented creative role in the rock music world. This documentary profiles four air personalities in major markets during this period: their programming, their politics and their deep connections with music and fans in the heyday of rock radio. Where are they now -- and how did they reinvent themselves as the medium and market changed?\n\nBack to Top\n\nRadio Books\n\nAmerican Radio History Website\n\nThis site has hundreds of magazines and books about radio. This link will take you to the books page, where among other things, you can find biographies of Dan Ingram and Hal Jackson and other radio memories written by such people as Steve Post (WBAI).\n\nAmerican Radio History Biography Page\n\nImages of America: New York City Radio\n\nby Alec Cumming & Peter Kanze\n\nOur friends Alec Cumming and Peter Kanze have put together a book for Arcadia Publishing that's filled with photographs about New York radio.\n\nThe book includes commentary and photos of such classic air personalities as Alison Steele and Dan Ingram as well as radio's pioneers, including inventors Edwin Armstrong and Lee DeForest. The book is a comprehensive, yet concise tour of New York City radio beginning at the turn of the last century and extending through the internet radio of today, stopping along the way at radio's pre-TV golden age and the growth of both top-40 and progresive rock & roll beginning in the late 1950s. The book contains many classic as well as rare photos. My favorites include a display of radios at Bamberger's Department Store from the 1920s, FM inventor Edwin H. Armstrong standing acrobatically on top of an antenna, some rare photos of Alan Freed along with such DJs as Jocko Henderson, Dr. Jive (Tommy Smalls), Bruce Morrow, and Bob Lewis before moving on to the progressive rock era of Rosko, Scott Muni, Murray the K, Alison Steele, Jim Kerr and many others. This is a must have for anyone who ever cared about New York radio.\n\nMore info and ordering here.\n\n(Just a link - we don't get anything for this)\n\nUp All Night: My Life and Times in Rock Radio\n\nby Carol Miller\n\nAs the book jacket says, \"The all-American chronicle of radio legend Carol Miller, from her rise to success in a male-dominated world to the rock stars she's known along the way to, for the first time, the private story of her quietly waged battle with a deadly illness.\"\n\nCarol's been on the air since 1971 and has been a New York air personality since 1973. To look at her and listen to her though, you'd think she couldn't have possibly been on the air for even half that time.\n\nClick here\n\nfor the book on Amazon\n\nClick here\n\nfor a NY Times article.\n\n1950's Radio in Color: The Lost Photographs of Deejay Tommy Edwards\n\nby Christopher Kennedy\n\n(The Kent State University Press - ISBN: 978-1-60635-072-0)\n\nChristopher Kennedy is an accomplished musician and songwriter who has released five albums with the band Ruth Ruth. For years, he's been looking for a copy of the long-lost rock ‘n’ roll film The Pied Piper of Cleveland, which purports to contain the earliest known footage of Elvis Presley. He still hasn't found that film, but in the process of looking for it, he came across a treasure trove of photographs taken by Cleveland DJ Tommy Edwards, mostly at WERE-AM and some concerts between 1955 and 1960. In addition, author Kennedy separately found copies of Edwards' own “T.E. Newsletter”, a remarkably comprehensive review of the music industry in Cleveland as well as Edwards' personal weekly survey of important pop and country records.\n\nThe photographs in this book are remarkable because they show artists from all genres of music (and film) at their very raw, unvarnished and un-manipulated beginnings. And many of the Ektachrome photographs, in spite of some color deterioration, are amazingly beautiful in spite of the fact that they were photographed with a mere Kodak Brownie camera. Against a bright red stage, we see the deep blue pants of a 29-year-old Chuck Berry, playing then as now, with a pickup band. We have some great shots of Elvis from 1955. And we have Gene Vincent, a pimply Roy Orbison as well as Dion and Sam Cooke. But there's also pop stars like Billy Eckstine, Jerry Vale, Andy Williams, Patti Page and Johnny Mathis; movie stars like Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda; and country stars like Johnny Cash. But my favorite photo in the book is a photo of soul singer Malcom Dodds, sitting at an old heavy-duty broadcast turntable.\n\nThe book contains several essays and each artist's photo is accompanied by a short article by the author, with many containing quotes about the artist from the “T.E. Newsletter” as well as contemporary comments from those involved. There's a lot of research contained in this volume.\n\nWhat's important about this book is how it demonstrates that radio and the radio DJ were once the core of the country's culture. The DJ was completely immersed in the music and the artists that they played. Artists sought out the publicity that only radio could provide. In the case of Tommy Edwards, his newsletter was as insightful as those published by any radio consultant in later decades. I think it's all too easy to forget just how important and powerful radio was and how much radio was responsible for the birth and development of rock ‘n’ roll. And yet, at least in Cleveland, rock ‘n’ roll lived comfortably along with country music, just as Ray Charles would later prove that soul and country could be one thing as well. I dare say that if a new genre of music evolved today, it would not survive because none of the media that exists today could act as its guardian the way that radio guided rock. Buy this book. It's one of the last memories of what made 1950's American radio great.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRadio Themes\n\nMany radio shows had their own themes. Some were specially composed for the show and some were based upon popular songs of the day. As we find them, we'll post them here.\n\nMake Believe Ballroom\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nMartin Block, a stalwart at WNEW-AM for many years, created the \"Make Believe Ballroom\" in New York City, which began broadcasting on February 3, 1935 and which was based on a concept developed by West Coast DJ Al Jaris. Block hosted the show until 1954, when he left for ABC. It was taken over by William B. Williams and later by Steve Allen. Block got bandleader Glenn Miller to write the theme for the show.\n\nIt's Make-Believe Ballroom Time\n\nPut all your cares away\n\nAll the bands are here to bring a cheer your way\n\nIt's Make-Believe Ballroom Time\n\nAnd free to everyone\n\nIt's no time to fret\n\nYour dial is set for fun\n\nJust close your eyes and visualize in your solitude\n\nYour favorite bands are on the stands\n\nAnd Mr. Miller puts you in the mood\n\nIt's Make-Believe Ballroom Time\n\nThe hour of sweet romance\n\nHere's your make-believe ballroom\n\nCome on, children, let's dance, let's dance!\n\nJumpin' With Symphony Sid\n\nLester Young & King Pleasure\n\nSymphony Sid (Sid Torin nee Sidney Tornopol) started in radio in 1937 at station WBNX in The Bronx and was one of the first DJs to play black jazz artists. By 1941, he was working at WHOM in New Jersey. He later worked at WWRL and WMCA. In 1949, he joined the ABC Radio Network.\n\nBecause of his influence, a number of songs were written about him, including \"Symphony in Sid\" by Illinois Jacquet and \"Jumpin with Symphony Sid\" detailed here.\n\nAfter an arrest for using marijuana, he moved to Boston for a time, but returned to New York City in 1957 to host a latin music show on WEVD.\n\nThis song has been recorded several times, most recently by Joe Jackson on the \"Jumpin' Jive\" album, released in 1981.\n\nJumpin' with my boy Sid in the city\n\nJumpin' with my boy Sid in the city\n\nMr. President of that DJ committee\n\nWe're gonna be up all night gettin' ready\n\nWe want you to spin the sounds from the city\n\nFar down in the land that's real, real pretty\n\nLet everything go real crazy over J-Z\n\nMake everything go real crazy over J-Z\n\nLet everything cool for me and my baby\n\nI don't wanna think we're listenin' to Lacy\n\nIt's gotta be Pressburg, Shearing or the Basie\n\nThe dial is all set, real close to 80\n\nLet it roll\n\nLet it roll\n\nLet it roll\n\nBack to Top"
