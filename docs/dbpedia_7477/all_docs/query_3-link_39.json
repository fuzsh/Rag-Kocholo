Keenan, Carlisle \"Squeaker\" Hamrick, and my name is Kent Smith. Each episode, we discuss a new film with our mystery guests from all over the world. Our mystery guest makes up a lovely nickname to speak freely about their experiences as directors, writers, DP's, Producers, and film experts. In this episode, we will discuss the 1967 American prison Drama film, Cool Hand Luke. This classic film stars Paul Newman and features an Oscar-winning performance from George Kennedy. As the years have passed, Cool Hand Luke has held up to the time, and even seems more realistic in today's current environment.",

In each episode, we discuss a new or old classic film with our guests who speak freely about their thoughts while we enjoy a few alcoholic drinks along the way. Our hosts: Kent Smith (award-winning director, writer, producer) has worked in the film business on such shows as Homeland, Mr. Mercedes, Outcast, and feature films as Tusk, Max, and The Other Zoe. He is the director of award-winning films, The Last Passport, Mike, and Little Package. He brings his film knowledge from his 5,000+ DVD collection and his onset experience to the table on each show. Patrick G. Keenan (award-winning actor), who you might have seen in Blind Side, Homeland, Tropical Cop Tales, Mike, and Little Package is no stranger to the stage, and he brings more jokes and tremendous knowledge to the already funny show. He has been in over 61 different films. Patrick is a long-time old-school walking encyclopedia of film knowledge with his amazing wit. Laura Truman comes to the table with her fantastic laugh on life and incredible film knowledge (Film Critic and old school film collector). She has one of the biggest film collections around, and she has worked many years at a movie rental house. On top of this she brings the big laugh to the table, and uncanny knowledge of the film word from the classics to the bad b-films. She brings it all to the table. Carlisle \"Squeaker\" Hamrick (Audio Genius and the boy who hates everything) is maybe the smartest guy on the show, so you never know where he will bring the questions. If you need a different option, that comes from the heart, then “Squeaker” will make sure that happens, plus he brings the heart to the show.
