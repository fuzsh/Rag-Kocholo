        "text": "STUART Rosenberg, who died on March 15 aged 79, made numerous forgettable television series and directed a dozen or so unremarkable thrillers of which the best-known, The Amityville Horror (1979), found success at the box office and inspired seven sequels; he secured his place in cinematic history, however, with Cool Hand Luke (1967), a film hailed by critics as a masterpiece.\n\nInspired by a Donn Pearce novel which Rosenberg had picked up in a Hollywood bookshop, the film tells the story of Luke Jackson (played by Paul Newman), a disillusioned war veteran who is caught vandalising parking meters and sentenced to two years' hard labour in a prison chain gang.\n\nLuke's refusal to conform, and the ridiculous lengths to which he is prepared to go to raise two fingers to authority, turn him into a folk hero among his fellow inmates, even as his repeated but hopeless escape attempts turn him into the bete noire of the prison guards. Buoyed up by Donn Pearce's sharp script and Lalo Schifrin's evocative laid-back score, Cool Hand Luke captured a vintage performance from Newman and added some memorable scenes to cinema history.\n\nIn one, launched by Luke's calmly ridiculous boast that he \"can eat 50 eggs\", he sets out to gorge himself with hard-boiled eggs as his fellow inmates cheer him on, and ends up spreadeagled on the floor, pale, sweaty and semi-conscious.\n\nIn another scene, after one of Luke's bids for freedom ends in his being caught and knocked unconscious, the sadistic prison warder (Strother Martin) stands over him and begins a drawling speech to the other prisoners with the words: \"What we've got here is failure to communicate\" - one of the most quoted lines in cinema history.\n\nThe film received four Academy Award nominations - though none for best director - with George Kennedy winning the best supporting actor award for his role as a tough convict who beats Luke in a fight but comes to respect him.\n\nStuart Rosenberg was born in Brooklyn on August 11, 1927. He attended New York University where he studied Irish Literature. While struggling to make ends meet as a graduate student and part-time teacher, he took a job as a film editor's apprentice in a Manhattan televisioncompany.\n\nRosenberg worked as a director on the Fifties NYPD television series Decoy and the crime series Naked City. In 1959 he was hired to direct a Hollywood film, Murder Inc, but was forced to pull out after an actors' and screenwriters' strike. Returning to television, he directed episodes of The Untouchables, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and other series and, in the Sixties, became a regular director of the CBS series The Defenders, for which he won an Emmy award in 1963.\n\nAfter Cool Hand Luke, Rosenberg directed Jack Lemmon and Catherine Deneuve in The April Fools (1969) and Robert Redford in Brubaker (1980).\n\nHe worked again with Paul Newman on WUSA (1970), Pocket Money (1972) and The Drowning Pool (1975). Other credits included The Laughing Policeman (1973), Voyage of the Damned (1976), and The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984), a comedy thriller set in Little Italy. His last film was My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys (1991).\n\nStuart Rosenberg married Margot Pohoryles in 1950. She survives him with their son, Benjamin Rosenberg, who is also a film director.\n\n© Telegraph"
