        "text": "One of the great tragic anti-heroes of the era, Luke never knows when he's beat, whether in a fist-fight with big George Kennedy, bluffing his way to victory in a game of poker, or most memorably forcing himself to eat dozens of eggs for a bet.\n\nRosenberg also worked with Robert Redford, Walter Matthau and Faye Dunaway and directed the haunted-house movie The Amityville Horror (1979), which was a major hit.\n\nA New Yorker, he studied Irish literature at university and worked as a teacher before carving out a career in television. By the late 1950s he was regularly directing episodes of the crime series Naked City.\n\nHe was hired to direct the feature film Murder, Inc. (1960), but a strike forced him to abandon the project and return to TV, where he worked on The Untouchables (1960-62) and The Twilight Zone (1960-63). His next film, Question 7 (1961), a drama about religious persecution in Germany, was an award-winner at the Berlin Film Festival, but was not widely seen.\n\nNewman also personally recruited Rosenberg to direct the 1970 drama, WUSA. They fell out over the final version of Pocket Money (1972), made up and worked together one more time on the thriller The Drowning Pool (1975).\n\nRosenberg is survived by his wife, to whom he had been married since 1950, his son, Benjamin, who was assistant director on several of his films, and four grandchildren."
