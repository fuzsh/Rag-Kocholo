        "text": "(1927–2007). American director Stuart Rosenberg had a successful career in television before turning to the big screen. He was known for such films as Cool Hand Luke (1967), The Amityville Horror (1979), and Brubaker (1980).\n\nRosenberg was born on August 11, 1927, in New York, New York. He studied Irish literature at New York University before working in television as an editor. In 1957 he directed episodes of Decoy and then worked on such notable series as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Untouchables, Naked City, Twilight Zone, and The Defenders. During that time he made his first feature film, Murder, Inc. (1960), though it was completed by producer Burt Balaban when an actors’ strike interrupted filming for several months. After the low-budget West German production Question 7 (1961), Rosenberg returned to television. In addition to his work on regular shows, he directed the TV movies Fame Is the Name of the Game and A Small Rebellion (both 1966).\n\nRosenberg returned to the big screen in 1967 with Cool Hand Luke, a popular updating of the rebel-within-a-prison formula. Paul Newman gave a charismatic performance as the antihero Luke, an irrepressible convict who gives new hope to his chain-gang compatriots; Strother Martin was the warden who tries but fails to break him. The film received four Academy Award nominations, and George Kennedy won an Oscar for his work as a fellow inmate who becomes allies with Luke. Rosenberg had less success with The April Fools (1969), a romantic comedy that paired Jack Lemmon and Catherine Deneuve as illicit lovers who intend to run away together; the supporting cast included Charles Boyer and Myrna Loy.\n\nRosenberg’s next film was Move (1970), an irreverent black comedy starring Elliott Gould as a failed playwright who writes pornographic novels for a living. WUSA (1970) was a political drama starring Newman as a drifter who becomes an announcer at a right-wing radio station, which he discovers has an alarming agenda. The film’s cast included Joanne Woodward, Anthony Perkins, Laurence Harvey, and Cloris Leachman. The slight comedy Pocket Money (1972) had Newman as a modern-day cowboy who agrees to drive cattle from Mexico to the United States, though things do not go as planned. The Laughing Policeman (1973) was a police procedural with Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern as partners investigating a mass slaying on a bus. Rosenberg reteamed with Newman on The Drowning Pool (1975), a sequel to the hit crime drama Harper (1966).\n\nThe movie Voyage of the Damned (1976) was a dramatization of the 1939 voyage of the ocean liner St. Louis, which transported German Jewish refugees who hoped to land in Havana, Cuba; when permission to dock was denied there and elsewhere, the ship had to return to Germany. The international cast included Max von Sydow, Faye Dunaway, James Mason, Ben Gazzara, and Julie Harris. Rosenberg took on less-serious fare with Love and Bullets (1979), a Charles Bronson action film.\n\nAfter more than a decade without a major hit, Rosenberg found box-office success in 1979 with The Amityville Horror. The thriller was based on Jay Anson’s nonfiction book about a Long Island, New York, house that was allegedly possessed by demons. James Brolin and Margot Kidder starred as the homeowners, and Rod Steiger was the priest who tries to exorcize the forces of darkness. Although widely panned by critics, The Amityville Horror was one of the year’s top-grossing films.\n\nRosenberg replaced Bob Rafelson on the 1980 prison exposé Brubaker, which starred Robert Redford as the new warden of a corrupt and abusive prison. He poses as a convict in order to experience the horrors firsthand and later encounters resistance when he tries to implement much-needed reforms. The fact-based drama was a critical and commercial success. Also popular was The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984), a crime comedy based on Vincent Patrick’s novel. Mickey Rourke starred as a small-timer who aspires to greater things, with Eric Roberts as his hopelessly ill-fated cousin.\n\nLet’s Get Harry (1986) was a little-seen action film with Robert Duvall as a soldier of fortune hired to rescue a man kidnapped in South America. Unhappy with changes made by the studio, Rosenberg had his name removed from the film; the directorial credit is given to “Alan Smithee.” In 1991 Rosenberg made his last film, My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, with Scott Glenn as an aging rodeo veteran and Ben Johnson as his ailing father.\n\nAfter retiring from filmmaking, Rosenberg taught at the American Film Institute. Among his students were Darren Aronofsky and Todd Field. Rosenberg died on March 15, 2007, in Beverly Hills, California."
