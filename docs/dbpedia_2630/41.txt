Avellaneda, Argentina - August 2022 - The "Racing Club de Avellaneda" is the only soccer team in Argentina's First Division to have St. John Bosco as its Patron Saint. For this reason, on Don Bosco's 207th birthday, the team gathered to pay tribute to him. On Tuesday, August 16, the chaplain, Fr. Juan Francisco Tomás, SDB, met with the players for a motivational talk on soccer, based on the figure of Don Bosco. The meeting was attended by professional soccer players, reserves, and youth sectors. The celebrations will continue throughout August, with the blessing of commemorative tiles at the "Tita Mattiussi" house, a guesthouse designated for Racing Club youth and located inside the Estadio Presidente Perón. Then, on Monday, August 22, during the match between Racing Club and San Lorenzo de Almagro (a club founded by Salesian Don Lorenzo Massa), various tributes to Don Bosco and greetings to the Salesian Family in Argentina will be offered.
