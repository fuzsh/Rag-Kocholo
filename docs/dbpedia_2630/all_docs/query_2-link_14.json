        "text": "For our latest article we are 'On the Move with...' Rocío Bueno who is an Argentine footballer who plays as a striker for the Racing Club de Avellaneda since 2020 and is a member of the Argentina women's national football team. Bueno joined Boca Juniors in 2014 and won the Women's Super Cup in 2015. While playing for Boca against Platense, she scored 5 goals in just 15 minutes. Bueno is also the first woman Argentine footballer to be transferred to a foreign club when she was loaned for a year to Sassuolo of the Italian Seria A in 2022.\n\nHow did you get into football?I started playing when I was 6 years old on a children's team, because at that time it was the only thing there was. I was able to play alone until I was 12 years old with them until they banned me.\n\nWhat are your other interests? My other hobby is music, I play the guitar and I like percussion too. I am a person who never went to a music conservatory, so I learned it all by ear as a tenth here in Argentina.\n\nWhere’s your favourite place you’ve travelled? I like to travel! I would love to finish visiting places in my country that are beautiful like the North. Bariloche the south is beautiful. I also travelled to Italy and I love the history that each place and each small town has.\n\nWhere do you want to travel next? Everywhere. My idea is to continue my football career in different countries to live the experience of being in other countries and other cultures.\n\nWhat’s inside your travel bag?I put a lot of clothes in my bag. towel, toiletry bag with creams and personal hygiene, hair dryer. flip flops, ankle boots, sneakers, shin guards, leggings, Racing club game clothing. headphones, speakers. And the bag is very good for me since my size is 10US and I can put several pairs. it's fantastic!\n\nWhat’s next for you? Enjoy football, which is what I love and what better company than with a KXKS. bag."
