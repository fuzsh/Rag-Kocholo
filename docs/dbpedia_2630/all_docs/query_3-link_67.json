        "text": "By BRIAN LEWIS\n\nManchester United laid further claim to the title of World’s Best Team with a 1-0 victory over Liga de Quinto in the Club World Cup final. England striker Wayne Rooney scored late in the second half today to lead 10-man United past the Ecuadorian side in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nRooney _ named player of the tournament _ took a pass from Cristiano Ronaldo and put an angled shot into the bottom corner of the net for a 73rd-minute goal. It gave a win to United, who’d been playing with ten men after defender Nemanja Vidic was red-carded in the 49th minute for elbowing Claudio Bieler.\n\n“It was a very difficult game, especially after going down to 10 men,” Rooney said. “I’m very happy to have scored and for us to become the best club in the world is something we can be very proud of.”"
