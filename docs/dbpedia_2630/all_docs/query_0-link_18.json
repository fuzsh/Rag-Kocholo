        "text": "We've got a long weekend ahead of us in Buenos Aires, which means the tenth round of the Torneo Apertura won't end until Monday evening, when River Plate host Gimnasia La Plata. Estudiantes have the chance to extend their lead at the top of the table first thing on Friday evening, and in between Lanús...
