        "text": "(ANS – Avellaneda) – As is the case every year, in August – the month of Don Bosco's birth – the multi-sport \"Racing Club\" in Avellaneda pays tribute to its Patron and Protector, St John Bosco. And to do so, this year the Department of Culture and History, together with the presence of authorities, members and young people, officially unveiled a majolica in tribute to Don Bosco in the Tita Mattiussi sports centre, next to the access door to the gym, the changing rooms and the offices of the youth teams. All this happened while, in the full Salesian spirit and in a festive oratory atmosphere, a few metres away, “Racing Solidario” – the Club's Social Responsibility Department – held a recreational and educational day for more than 500 boys and girls.\n\nThe ceramic majolica measures 62 x 46 cm and was designed by artist Gustavo Martínez, a fan and member of the Racing Club, who, together with the artists who contributed to its creation, was present at the ceremony.\n\nAfter introductory words From Fr Juan Francisco Tomás, SDB, who recalled the history of Don Bosco as Patron of the Racing Club in his address, starting from 1967 the majolica was unveiled and blessed by Bishop Marcelo Margni the Bishop of Avellaneda-Lanús.\n\nIn his message, the prelate said: “As bishop, I want to say that at this moment football is giving us a great example for our faith. Listening to Messi and other players talk about God is moving. These are young people who through effort, work, training and their talents know how to communicate things that sometimes even the Church has lost the ability to communicate: teamwork, the ability to get involved, for everyone to succeed, not for themselves... Blessing this majolica with the figure of Don Bosco, which also has very important connotations for the whole world of sports in Argentina and for the world of youth, honours me, makes me happy. I am very grateful. I ask God to bless this majolica that always connects us with the transcendent and with the values that lead us to build the Gospel.\"\n\nA few minutes earlier, the San Ignacio Scout Group, sponsored by the Racing Club which is located on the same land as the Tita Mattiussi, went ahead to plant a tree as a sign of peace and attention for children."
