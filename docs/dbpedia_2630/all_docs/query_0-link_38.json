        "text": "The second Superliga is now upon us. In 2017, Argentina’s top tier, the Primera División, was rebranded amid great pomp and circumstance, and here we arem, back again for another edition with 26 teams vying to emulate reigning champions Boca Juniors and take the title over the next year.\n\nGuillermo Barros Schelotto’s men took the inaugural trophy back in May despite an unconvincing end to the season and will be the team to beat again after reinforcing an already formidable squad heavily over the winter. But the Xeneize will not have things their own way: from Independiente to River Plate and a host of others besides, there are plenty of other sides who will fancy their chances.\n\nThese past few months have seen a whirlwind of activity across the Superliga, with players coming and going at a frightening rate. The Times, however, is here to bring you up to speed on all the biggest moves since the last league came to an end, and venture a few predictions over how the 2018-19 campaign might pan out...\n\nALDOSIVI\n\nCoach: Gustavo Álvarez.\n\nLast year: 1st in Primera B Nacional (promoted).\n\nKey signings: Denis Stracqualursi (Tigre), Facundo Castillón (Lanús), Fernando Godoy (Talleres).\n\nKey departures: Leandro Somoza, Sebastian Moyano (Gimnasia), Maxi Velázquez.\n\nPlayer to watch: Cristian Chávez.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Barbecued swordfish. As the Superliga’s only representative on the Atlantic coast this season, Aldosivi bring a pescatarian alternative to the traditional beef-fest.\n\nPrediction: Should have enough to stay up, having returned to the Primera at the first time of asking last term.\n\nARGENTINOS JUNIORS\n\nCoach: Alfredo Berti.\n\nLast year: 12th.\n\nKey signings: Raúl Bobadilla (Monchengladbach), Junior Benítez (Benfica), Franco López (River).\n\nKey departures: Lucas Barrios, Nicolás Gonzalez (Stuttgart).\n\nPlayer to watch: Alexis MacAllister\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Rack of lamb. Everyone’s supposed favourite, but never that impressive when you try it.\n\nPrediction: The Paternal side have everything necessary to kick on and break into the top reaches of the table.\n\nATLETICO TUCUMÁN\n\nCoach: Ricardo Zielinski.\n\nLast year: 15th.\n\nKey signings: Mauro Matos (Chacarita), Juan Mercier (San Lorenzo), José San Román (Newell’s).\n\nKey departures: Augusto Batalla,\n\nPlayer to watch: Luis Rodríguez\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Empanadas. A surprisingly effective addition to the established order.\n\nPrediction: Anything above last year’s deadaverage season would be acceptable for the Decano.\n\nBANFIELD\n\nCoach: Julio César Falcioni.\n\nLast year: 17th.\n\nKey signings: Nicolás Bertólo (River).\n\nKey departures: Pablo Mouche (San Lorenzo), Erik Remedi (Atlanta Utd), Claudio Villagra (San Luis).\n\nPlayer to watch: Emanuel Cecchini.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Cuadril. Not always considered amongst the favourites, but often worth a try.\n\nPrediction: The talent is there to break into the top 10.\n\nBELGRANO\n\nCoach: Lucas Bernardi.\n\nLast year: 13th.\n\nKey signings: Gastón Gil Romero (Estudiantes), Denis Rodríguez (Newell’s).\n\nKey departures: Cristian Lema (Benfica), Jonathan Ramis (Vélez).\n\nPlayer to watch: Matias Suárez.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Potato salad. Stodgy, not too exciting and always hits the mark.\n\nPrediction: Lower mid-table.\n\nBOCA JUNIORS\n\nCoach: Guillermo Barros Schelotto.\n\nLast year: 1st.\n\nKey signings: Mauro Zárate (Vélez), Sebastíán Villa (Tolima), Esteban Andrada (Lanús), Lucas Olaza (Talleres), Carlos Izquierdoz (Santos Laguna).\n\nKey departures: Walter Bou (Vitoria), Guillermo Sara (Lanús), Junior Benítez (Argentinos).\n\nPlayer to watch: Cristian Pavón. Having signed a fresh new contract at the Bombonera, the Argentina international’s form will once more be vital to his team. Pavón’s goals and assists are the cornerstone of the Xeneize’s play, although he should have more creative assistance this term alongside Zárate.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Bife de lomo. The costliest, most-coveted cut on the grill. Can still be outperformed on a bad day, however.\n\nPrediction: Overwhelming favourites to make it three league titles in a row.\n\nCOLÓN\n\nCoach: Eduardo Domínguez.\n\nLast year: 11th.\n\nKey signings: Franco Zuculini (Verona), Gustavo Toledo (Independiente), Erik Godoy (Tigre).\n\nKey departures: Alexander Domínguez (Vélez), Diego Vera (Tigre).\n\nPlayer to watch: Javier Correa. Superliga asado ingredient: Salchicha parrillera. A strong starter that is usually forgotten when the real big guns get going.\n\nPrediction: Another Sudamericana berth should be the minimum for the Sabaleros.\n\nDEFENSA Y JUSTICIA\n\nCoach: Sebastián Beccacece.\n\nLast year: 9th.\n\nKey signings: Francisco Cerro (Rayo), Lisandro Martínez (Newell’s), Marcelo Larrondo (River), Jonas Gutierrez (Independiente).\n\nKey departures: Fernando Márquez, Fernando Elizari (Johor), Marcelo Benítez (Vitoria). Player to watch: Ciro Rius.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Mollejas. The conoisseur’s asado choice, even if the masses don’t appreciate them.\n\nPrediction: With a bit of luck, dark horses for Libertadores qualification.\n\nESTUDIANTES\n\nCoach: Leandro Benítez.\n\nLast year: 16th.\n\nKey signings: Fernando Evangelista (Newell’s), Lucas Albertengo (Monterrey).\n\nKey departures: Gastón Gil Romero (Belgrano), Leandro Desábato (retired)\n\nPlayer to watch: Lucas Rodríguez.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Lechón. While its bovine rivals take centre-stage, consistently challenges for top honours.\n\nPrediction: A modest improvement on last year’s mid-table finish\n\nGIMNASIA\n\nCoach: Pedro Troglio .\n\nLast year: 23rd.\n\nKey signings: Santiago Silva (Talleres), Sebastián Moyano (Aldosivi), Víctor Ayala.\n\nKey departures: Brahian Alemán (Al-Ettifaq), Facundo Pereyra (Apollon Limassol).\n\nPlayer to watch: Víctor Ayala.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Kidneys. A real minority choice but also a guilty pleasure.\n\nPrediction: Bottom half of the table once again.\n\nGODOY CRUZ\n\nCoach: Diego Dabove.\n\nLast year: 2nd.\n\nKey signings: Joaquín Varela (Newell’s).\n\nKey departures: Juan Garro (Huracán), Pol Fernández (Racing).\n\nPlayer to watch: Santiago García.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Red wine. Always present, and at its best can be the star of the asado.\n\nPrediction: 2017-18’s shock runners-up have lost two key players, but with the goals of ‘El Morro’ García they can still dream of staying up there amongst the elite.\n\nHURACÁN\n\nCoach: Gustavo Alfaro.\n\nLast year: 4th.\n\nKey signings: Carlos Auzqui, Iván Rossi (River), Juan Garro (Godoy Cruz), Saúl Salcedo (Olimpia).\n\nKey departures: Ignacio Pussetto (Udinese), Martín Nervo (Santos Lugano)\n\nPlayer to watch: Andrés Chávez.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Entraña. Exquisite at best, dried out and tough at its worst.\n\nPrediction: A repeat of fourth place may prove unrealistic, but Huracán have more than enough to stay in the top 10.\n\nINDEPENDIENTE\n\nCoach: Ariel Holan.\n\nLast year: 6th.\n\nKey signings: Ezequiel Cerrutti (AlHilal), Pablo Hernández (Celta), Guillermo Burdisso (León), Francisco Silva (Cruz Azul), Carlos Benavidez (Defensor Sporting).\n\nKey departures: Gustavo Toledo (Colón), Juan Manuel Martínez, Damián Albil, Jonás Gutierrez (Defensa y Justicia).\n\nPlayer to watch: Maxi Meza. He might not have shined at the World Cup, but the winger is still one of the finest talents in the Superliga. Meza will once more be key for the Rojo as they fight on multiple fronts this season.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Vacío. A consistent favourite that has everything it takes to come out on top.\n\nPrediction: One of the few teams on paper who can challenge Boca for the Superliga. If the Avellaneda team can stay fit and in form there is no reason why they cannot take the title.\n\nLANÚS\n\nCoach: Ezequiel Carboni.\n\nLast year: 21st.\n\nKey signings: Sebastián Ribas (Patronato), Jorge Pereyra Díaz (Johor), Guillermo Sara (Boca).\n\nKey departures: Esteban Andrada (Boca), Germán Denis, Iván Marcone (Cruz Azul), Román Martínez (Morón), Nehuén Paz (Bologna), Facundo Castillón (Aldosivi).\n\nPlayer to watch: Lautaro Acosta.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Chorizo. Quality can vary hugely, but it wouldn’t be an asado without them.\n\nPrediction: Carboni has seen a lot of changes in his personnel, meaning Lanús are somewhat an unknown quantity. An improvement over last year’s 22nd place is a must, though.\n\nNEWELL’S OLD BOYS\n\nCoach: Omar De Felippe.\n\nLast year: 22nd.\n\nKey signings: Iván Píris (Monterrey), Zé Turbo (Inter), Leandro Grimi (Racing) Key departures: Denis Rodríguez (Belgrano), José San Román, Joaquín Varela (Godoy Cruz).\n\nPlayer to watch: Brian Sarmiento.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Chimichurri, a niche ingredient that adds a tough of spice (not, as some wags might suggest, barbecued cat).\n\nPrediction: The only way is up for Newell’s after an awful 2017-18 season, but they might be in for another struggle.\n\nPATRONATO\n\nCoach: Juan Pablo Pumpido.\n\nLast year: 19th.\n\nKey signings: Ezequiel Rescaldani (Atlético Nacional), Mauricio Sperduti (Banfield), Pablo Ledesma (Colón).\n\nKey departures: Sebastián Ribas (Lanús).\n\nPlayer to watch: Damián Lemos.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Grilled chicken. Nobody knows why it’s there, and few would miss it if it were gone.\n\nPrediction: Ribas’ exit will leave relegationthreatened Patronato short of firepower, a big loss for the relegation battle that looks on the cards.\n\nRACING CLUB\n\nCoach: Eduardo Coudet.\n\nLast year: 7th.\n\nKey signings: Gustavo Bou (Tijuana), Gabriel Arias (La Calera), Marcelo Díaz (Pumas), Eugenio Mena (Bahía), Jonatan Cristaldo (Vélez), Mauricio Martínez (Central).\n\nKey departures: Lautaro Martínez (Inter), Juan Musso (Udinese), Miguel Barbieri (Central), Diego González (Tijuana), Enrique Triverio (Toluca), Marcelo Meli (Vitoria).\n\nPlayer to watch: Ricardo Centurión. ‘Ricky’ will have a big point to prove this season after being overlooked at the last minute for Argentina’s World Cup squad. The winger is quick, talented and unpredictable, a heady cocktail that makes him such a tough player to stop.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Bondiola. At its best, a spectacular meat – but a disaster if left untended.\n\nPrediction: Coudet’s Racing were one of the most exciting teams to watch during the first six months of 2018, although La Academia went off the boil somewhat in the final weeks after making such a great start to the year. If they can keep up that rhythm, a Libertadores spot is attainable.\n\nRIVER PLATE\n\nCoach: Marcelo Gallardo.\n\nLast year: 8th.\n\nKey signings: None.\n\nKey departures: Marcelo Saracchi (RB Leipzig), Ariel Rojas (San Lorenzo), Carlos Auzqui (Huracán).\n\nPlayer to watch: Lucas Martínez Quarta. At 22, the defender has what it takes to marshal River’s backline, and he should take a starring role this term with both Jonathan Maidana and Javier Pinola edging toward the end of the line. It is a lot of responsibility on such young shoulders, but Martínez Quarta has so far looked up to the challenge.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Bife de chorizo. Not quite as expensive as lomo but still a very solid upper-end cut.\n\nPrediction: The lack of transfer activity at the Monumental might be troubling for River fans, but the club will be disappointed by anything less than Copa Libertadores qualification.\n\nROSARIO CENTRAL\n\nCoach: Edgardo Bauza.\n\nLast year: 20th.\n\nKey signings: Miguel Barbieri (Racing), Matias Caruzzo (San Lorenzo), Gonzalo Bettini (Banfield)\n\nKey departures: Paulo Ferrari (retired), Mauricio Martinez (Racing), Fernando Tobio (Palmeiras), Pablo Becker (Antofogasta).\n\nPlayer to watch: Andrés Lioi.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Provoleta. Great in limited doses, although too much can soon become greasy and sickly.\n\nPrediction: Boosted by the return of Canalla idol Bauza on the bench, Central must hope for a better season. A top 10 finish is possible after a series of intelligent deals during the winter, too.\n\nSAN LORENZO\n\nCoach: Claudio Biaggio.\n\nLast year: 3rd.\n\nKey signings: Ariel Rojas (River), Pablo Mouche (Lanús).\n\nKey departures: Juan Mercier (Atlético Tucumán), Matías Caruzzo (Central), Marcos Angeleri (Nacional), Leandro Romagnoli (retired).\n\nPlayer to watch: Nicolás Blandi. The ungainly forward is not much to look at, but nobody can argue with his effectiveness in front of goal. With goals in short supply around Bajo Flores the ex-Boca man will be more important than ever.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Chinchulines. Great on paper, often rubbery and a soggy disappointment in practice. Prediction: The Cuervo are infuriatingly difficult to analyse, with solid performances invariably followed by shocking plateaus of indifferent form. A Copa Sudamericana spot, however, is the least Biaggio’s men should aim for.\n\nSAN MARTÍN DE SAN JUAN\n\nCoach: Walter Coyette.\n\nLast year: 18th.\n\nKey signings: Nazareno Solís, Franco Cristaldo (Boca), Gonzalo Castillejos (Apollon Smyrnis), Diego Cardozo (Atlante).\n\nKey departures: Matias Escudero, Leandro Vega, Joaquín Molina\n\nPlayer to watch: Nazareno Solís.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Chicken al verdeo. Slightly more exciting than plain chicken, but still nothing to get the heart racing.\n\nPrediction: Starting in one of the four relegation spots, it would take a brave man to bet against the drop.\n\nSAN MARTÍN DE TUCUMÁN\n\nCoach: Rubén Forestello.\n\nLast year: 3rd in Primera B Nacional (promoted via play-off).\n\nKey signings: Álvaro Fernández (San Martín SJ), Rodrigo Moreira (Independiente), Matías Cahais (Olimpo).\n\nKey departures: Ismael Benegas (Guaraní), Juan Galeano (Aldosivi), Walter Busse Player to watch: Claudio Bieler. Superliga asado ingredient: Lemon. Offers little on its own, but could prove to be a great companion in the Superliga – particularly with a classic Tucumán empanada.\n\nPrediction: San Martín’s first Primera campaign since 2009 promises to be extremely difficult, with survival the only priority.\n\nTALLERES\n\nCoach: Juan Pablo Vovojda.\n\nLast year: 5th.\n\nKey signings: Gonzalo Maroni, Tomás Pochettino (Boca), Brian Montenegro (Olimpia), Andrés Cubas (Defensa y Justicia).\n\nKey departures: Santiago Silva (Gimnasia), Matías Pisano, Lucas Olaza (Boca)\n\nPlayer to watch: Pablo Guiñazú.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Fernet. Improves an asado tenfold with its mere presence, and a Córdoba classic. Prediction: Another Libertadores finish would be a shock, but Talleres must aspire to at least the top 10.\n\nTIGRE\n\nCoach: Cristian Ledesma.\n\nLast year: 24th.\n\nKey signings: Diego Vera (Colón), Lucas Rodríguez (Veracruz), Jorge Ortiz (Belgrano).\n\nKey departures: Claudio Spinelli (Genoa), Denis Stracqualursi, Erik Godoy (Colón). Player to watch: Diego Morales.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Coca Cola. Always on the table, barely raises an eyebrow – until it’s gone.\n\nPrediction: Another tough season in store, with a relegation battle on the cards.\n\nUNIÓN\n\nCoach: Leonardo Madelón.\n\nLast year: 10th.\n\nKey signings: Nelson Acevedo (Racing), Matías García (San Lorenzo), Claudio Corvalán (Arsenal).\n\nKey departures: Leonardo Sánchez (Aldosivi).\n\nPlayer to watch: Franco Soldano.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Asado. One of the most humble cuts on the table, but one of the most effective performers overall.\n\nPrediction: Hard-pressed to emulate last year’s success, but a top-half finish is feasible.\n\nVÉLEZ SARSFIELD\n\nCoach: Gabriel Heinze.\n\nLast year: 14th.\n\nKey signings: Alexander Domínguez (Colón), Jonathan Ramis (Belgrano), Gastón Giménez (Estudiantes).\n\nKey departures: Mauro Zárate (Boca), Santiago Cáseres (Villarreal), Jonathan Cristaldo (Racing).\n\nPlayer to watch: Matías Vargas.\n\nSuperliga asado ingredient: Morcilla. Definitely an acquired taste, not unlike Vélez’s abrasive trainer.\n\nPrediction: Mid-table at best."
