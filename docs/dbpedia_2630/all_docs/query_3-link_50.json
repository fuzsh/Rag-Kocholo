        "text": "The Seminole Hard Rock Poker Open has been the cornerstone of our majors since that first run in 2013 when we shocked the world with a $10,000,000 guarantee Championship but also introduced them to the South Florida poker scene.\n\nThe 2024 run featured the most events in SHRPO series history and we offered up more than $8,000,000 in guaranteed prize pools and nearly doubled that amount in prize money awarded.\n\nEvents: 61\n\nEntries: 16,636\n\nGuarantees: $8,090,000\n\nPrize Pools: $15,636,775\n\nIn historical numbers, this is the 15th consecutive major series where we awarded at least $10,000,000 in prize money.\n\nWe had a packed Grand Ballroom, and the Meeting Room was often filled. We threw one of our biggest single-day Deep Stacks ever, with 612 entries in $400 buy-in Event 13 and more than $200K up for grabs.\n\nTop one-day Deep Stack fields:\n\n2023 RRPO – 731 entries\n\n2024 SHRPO – 612 Entries\n\n2024 Showdown – 572 entries\n\n2024 Showdown – 548 entries\n\n2022 LHPO – 527 entries\n\nAs we’ve done over the last few years, we headlined the series with more than one huge tournament, we rolled out the Big4 format once again.\n\nThe Big 4 consists of four scheduled so there are always multiple big events running for the last five days of the series. First up was the $3,000,000 guaranteed SHRPO Championship, followed by a $3,000 Deep Stack, a $1,100 Deep Stack, and the big-money $25K High Roller.\n\nPaul Snead took the top spot in the SHRPO Championship, earning $529,428 after a heads-up deal. Bryn Kenney won the $25K High Roller after dominating the final table as it went from nine players to a winner in less than 90 minutes.\n\nKevin Ordet won the $3,000 Deep Stack and Benjamin Moschel took the $1,100 Deep Stack title, both after long, tough heads-up battles.\n\nSHRPO Championship: Paul Snead – $529,428\n\nBig 4 $25K High Roller: Bryn Kenney – $487,990\n\nBig 4 $3,000 Deep Stack: Kevin Ordet – $190,800\n\nBig 4 $1,100 Deep Stack: Ben Moschel – $89,800\n\nWe opened the series with a multi-flight $400 Deep Stack with a $1,000,000 guarantee, and an incredible 5,870 entries showed up, nearly doubling the mark. 19-year-old Karl Creazzo capped off the weekend with his first win in his first live tournament.\n\nThat started our series, but we had history throughout, including the last tournament on the last night; Event 61 bookended the SHRPO series with one final shining moment.\n\nAll-time Hollywood wins leader Raminder Singh spent most of the series with his family, his focus, until the last few days. He had a one-win lead over Michael Newman on the wins list but added to it late Tuesday evening when he captured the $300 Quad Stack Black Chip Bounty for his 13th major Hollywood trophy.\n\nSingh wasn’t the only one who tweaked our all-time leaderboard; David Shmuel won his tenth, Phil Hui captured his eighth, and Ari Engel joined the conversation with six.\n\nThe updated all-time wins leaderboard:\n\nRaminder Singh – 13 wins\n\nMichael Newman – 11 wins\n\nYuval Bronshtein – 10 wins\n\nDavid Shmuel – 10 wins\n\nMatt Bretzfield – 9 wins\n\nJohn Holley – 8 wins\n\nPhil Hui – 8 wins\n\nBrian Altman – 7 wins\n\nDavid Prociak – 7 wins\n\nGabriel Ramos – 7 wins\n\nOther notable wins include:\n\nPoker Hall of Famer Erik Seidel walked into the Grand Ballroom on his first day and won the $10,000 No-Limit Hold’em Event 26 title.\n\nLandon Tice, 2024 WPT Poker Showdown runner-up, won the one-day $10K Deep Stack on the last day for $246,300.\n\nNick Seward won the $1,100 Deep Stack preliminary on our Gorilla Gaming live stream; max late regged the $2,200 Deep Stack when he was done and won that the next day.\n\nChristopher rode away with wins in our $600 and $1,100 H.O.R.S.E. events.\n\nLenard Adams won two turbos during the series, and Shahar Biniaminov and Matthew Wolfson also won two 2024 SHRPO trophies.\n\nAs always, we could not do any of this without the support of our players, our local favorites, and our traveling friends. You keep showing up and we keep trying to put on the best events possible.\n\nWe appreciate you and thank you once again.\n\nNext up, we look forward to seeing everyone for the 2024 Rock ‘N’ Roll Poker Open, which will be held from November 20 through December 3.\n\nCheers!\n\nComplete list of updates and results below for all 61 trophy events on the 2024 SHRPO schedule\n\nSHRPO Championship: Paul Snead – $529,428\n\nBig 4 $25K High Roller: Bryn Kenney – $487,990\n\nBig 4 $3,000 Deep Stack: Kevin Ordet – $190,800\n\nBig 4 $1,100 Deep Stack: Ben Moschel – $89,800"
