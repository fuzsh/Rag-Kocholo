        "text": "Argentine footballer\n\nClaudio Daniel Bieler (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈklawðjo ˈβjeleɾ]; born March 1, 1984) is an Argentine footballer who plays as a forward for Agropecuario.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nRise in career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005 Bieler made his professional debut with Primera División Argentina squad Colón de Santa Fe. The following year he was loaned to Primera B Nacional Argentina squad Atlético Rafaela, where he led the league with sixteen goals. In 2007, he caught the eye of fellow Argentine Claudio Borghi who signed him to Colo-Colo. Bieler attained the 2007 Clausura championship in Chile with Colo Colo.\n\nLDU Quito\n\n[edit]\n\nAt LDU Quito, he built a reputation as a very capable striker. He was an integral part of the squad that won the 2008 Copa Libertadores (where he had a goal wrongfully disallowed for offsides in the final game) and the squad that was the runner-up of the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. He was the team's top-scorer in 2008 with 17 goals, and was the Ecuadorian Serie A's top-scorer in 2009 with 22 goals. He provided the winning goal in Liga's win in the first leg of the 2009 Recopa Sudamericana and scored one of three goals in the second leg at home. In the 2009 Copa Sudamericana, he was the tournament's top-scorer with eight goals, including two hat-tricks against Argentine team Lanús and Uruguayan team River Plate.\n\nHe scored his first hat-trick for Serie A on February 12, 2012, in the match between LDU Quito and Olmedo, where LDU Quito won 5–0. He garnered interest from Mexican clubs, although he expressed his wish to retire with Liga de Quito.\n\nRacing Club\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 6, 2010 Racing Club de Avellaneda signed the striker to a three-and-a-half-year contract with 50% of the Bieler sporting rights.[2]\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\n[edit]\n\nBieler signed with Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer as a designated player on December 18, 2012.[3] Sporting paid an undisclosed transfer fee to LDU Quito to obtain Bieler.\n\nBieler was released by Kansas City on January 20, 2015.[4]\n\nBelgrano\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 6 January 2016 Bieler signed with CA Belgrano.[5]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to his performance playing for LDU Quito, elements of the Ecuadorian press have suggested that Bieler should play for the Ecuador national team. When asked to comment on the remarks, he has publicly stated that he would change nationalities to play for Ecuador.[6][7] On February 4, 2010, he was called up by Argentine manager Diego Maradona,[8] but ended up not playing because of a suspected injury.[9] In May 2010, Bieler returned to Ecuador to undergo the naturalization process.[10] However, he is not eligible to play for the Ecuador national team.[11]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nColo-Colo[12]\n\nPrimera División de Chile (1): 2007 Clausura\n\nLDU Quito[12]\n\nCopa Libertadores (1): 2008\n\nRecopa Sudamericana (1): 2009\n\nCopa Sudamericana (1): 2009\n\nIndependiente del Valle\n\nCopa Sudamericana (1): 2019\n\nSporting Kansas City[12]\n\nMLS Cup (1): 2013\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBieler became a citizen of Ecuador in 2011 since he is in a free union with Ecuadoran girlfriend.[13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
