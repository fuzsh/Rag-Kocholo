Wife Cathy Bennet (Dorothy Duke) finds temporary pleasure at swinging parties or in the arms of another man, Frank Grover (John Michael). Husband George Bennet (William Thomason) confronts his wife about the widening chasm between them; she tells him she feels they are somehow incomplete without children. She undergoes testing to see why she hasn't conceived. George, who has accompanied her, is asked to also undergo testing and is found to be the problem: he is sterile.
