Additional features have been added in most parts of this second volume. Inquiries, suggestions and comments on all details of the Catalog are solicited and should be addressed to the Chief of the Cata- loging Division, Copyright Office, Library of Con- gress, Washington 25, D. C. Contents.—This part of the Catalog of Copy- right Entries contains an alphabetical list of books and selected pamphlets registered in the Copyright Office in Class A and certain other classes from January 1, 1948 through June 30, 1948. In addition a few 1947 registrations are included. Renewal registrations in this class made during the first half of 1948 will be found in Part 14A of the Catalog. Arrangement and Entry.—The main section of this catalog consists of an alphabetical arrange- ment of complete entries under main headings (author, editor, or title); and of brief entries in the form of cross references from joint authors, editors, etc. This part is followed by an index to titles. Under main heading each entry includes the title, joint authors up to three, illlustrators, editors, compilers and translators and any edition informa- tion present in the work. Imprint information, consisting of place of publica- tion and name of publisher as given on the title page, follows except in cases when the publisher is also the copyright claimant. In these cases the name of the publisher appears only in the statement of the facts of copyright registration. Imprint date as given on the title-page follows next only when it differs from the year date of publication furnished ili in the copyright application. Certain physical characteristics of each work will be found in the statement of the number of volumes or numbered pages and the use of the abbreviation “‘illus.” for illustrative matter not otherwise indicated. If the work belongs toa series, this fact isalso noted. Each added entry cross-reference consists of the name of the joint ‘author, illustrator, editor, compiler or translator and the title of the main work, followed by reference to the heading under which the com- plete entry will be found. Copyright Data.—The portion of the entry giving the facts of copyright registration begins with the copyright symbol © and consists of the name of the copyright claimant, the chief place of publication given on the title page (when the claim- ant and publisher are the same), the date of pub- lication as given in the copyright application, a brief statement of the matter on which copyright is claimed (if claim is based on new matter) and the registration number. For ad interim works, the date the work was deposited in the Copyright Office is given, preceded by the abbreviation “1c,” in addition to the date of publication. In the case of United States editions for which ad interim registration was previously made the regis- tration number is followed by a statement of the previous (ad interim) registration when available. Abbreviations.—Definitions are not given for abbreviations in common use and included in stand- ard reference works. The following abbreviations are used in the Catalog of Copyright Entries with the meanings shown: 1lc—one copy deposited; _a. k. a.—also known as; d. b. a.—doing business as; t. a.—trading as. Deposit of Copies.—In the case of every copy- right entry listed in the Catalog, the deposit of copies (or copy) as required by Title 17, U.S. C,, secs. 12 and 13 has been made. Authority.—The Catalog of Copyright Entries is published by authority of Title 17, U.S. C., secs. 210 and 211. Section 210 provides that the Catalog ‘shall be admitted in any court as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein as regards any copyright registration.” Organization of the Catalog.—This issue of the Catalog is part of Volume 2 of the Third Series. The parts are numbered according to the alphabet- ical sequence of classes as listed in Title 17, U.S. C., sec. 5. Letters are added to the part numbers to indicate subdivisions. The classes of material principally contained in each part are listed, together with their respective symbols, under the title of the part in the Table which follows. In each case, the first letter of the symbol is that of the class under which registration is made; the second, if any, is a designation added by the Copyright Office for purposes of statistical analysis of registrations. The symbols R and RR do not represent classes designated by the Copy- right Act, but have been adopted by the Copyright Office to distinguish renewal copyright registrations. Each part may also contain registrations made under other symbols if the subject matter or type of material of these registrations is similar to that generally included in the part. Publication and Subscription.—The annual subscription price for all parts of the complete yearly Catalog of Copyright Entries is $20, payable in ad- vance to the Superintendent of Documents, Govern- ment Printing Office, Washington 25, D. C. Each part of the Catalog is published in two semi annual numbers covering, respectively, the periods January-June and July-December. The prices given in the table are for each semiannual number. Orders for the complete Catalog or any of its parts should be addressed to the Superintendent of Documents.
