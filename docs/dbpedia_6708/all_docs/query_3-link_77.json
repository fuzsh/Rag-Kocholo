        "text": "Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Exam (VFSE)/Esophagram\n\nA video fluoroscopic swallowing exam (VFSE) looks at your ability to swallow safely and effectively. This noninvasive exam uses fluoroscopy to help identify the thicknesses and textures of liquid and food that you can most safely eat.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant. List any recent illnesses, medical conditions, medications you're taking and allergies, especially to contrast materials. This procedure requires little to no special preparation. Your doctor may tell you not to smoke, chew gum, eat or drink several hours prior to your exam. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need to wear a gown.\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\nWhat does the equipment look like?\n\nThis exam typically uses a radiographic table, one or two x-ray tubes, and a video monitor. Fluoroscopy converts x-rays into video images. Doctors use it to watch and guide procedures. The x-ray machine and a detector suspended over the exam table produce the video.\n\nDuring VFSE, the patient usually sits or stands upright in front or to the side of the x-ray camera.\n\ntop of page\n\nHow does the procedure work?\n\nX-rays are a form of radiation like light or radio waves. X-rays pass through most objects, including the body. The technologist carefully aims the x-ray beam at the area of interest. The machine produces a small burst of radiation that passes through your body. The radiation records an image on photographic film or a special detector.\n\nFluoroscopy uses a continuous or pulsed x-ray beam to create images and project them onto a video monitor. Your exam may use a contrast material to clearly define the area of interest. Fluoroscopy allows your doctor to view joints or internal organs in motion. The exam also captures still images or movies and stores them electronically on a computer.\n\nYour doctor may record your exam to review the images later.\n\nMost x-ray images are electronically stored digital files. Your doctor can easily access these stored images to diagnose and manage your condition.\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\ntop of page\n\nWhat are the limitations of VFSE?\n\nA VFSE only evaluates the area from the back of the mouth through the throat to the top of the chest. Sometimes, your symptoms are due to problems in the esophagus, which is lower in the chest. If so, your doctor may perform an esophagram (barium swallow exam).\n\ntop of page"
