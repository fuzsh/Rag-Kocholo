        "text": "Hepatoblastoma is a cancer that forms in the tissues of the liver. It is the most common type of childhood liver cancer and usually affects children younger than 3 years of age.\n\nThe liver is one of the largest organs in the body. It has two lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage. Three of the many important functions of the liver are the following:\n\nto make bile to help digest fats from food\n\nto store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy\n\nto filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine\n\nIn hepatoblastoma, the histology (how the cancer cells look under a microscope) affects the way the cancer is treated. The histology for hepatoblastoma may be one of the following:\n\nwell-differentiated fetal (pure fetal) histology\n\nsmall cell undifferentiated histology hepatoblastoma and rhabdoid tumors of the liver\n\nmixed epithelial and fetal histology (non–well-differentiated fetal histology, non-small cell undifferentiated histology)\n\nCauses and risk factors for hepatoblastoma\n\nHepatoblastoma is caused by certain changes in the way the liver cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. Often, the exact cause of the cell changes is unknown. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer?\n\nA risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop hepatoblastoma, and it will develop in some children who don’t have a known risk factor. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\n\nThe following syndromes or conditions are risk factors for hepatoblastoma:\n\nAicardi syndrome\n\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\n\nhemihyperplasia\n\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n\nglycogen storage disease\n\npremature birth with a very low weight at birth\n\nSimpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome\n\ncertain genetic changes, such as trisomy 18\n\nChildren at risk of developing hepatoblastoma may have tests done to check for cancer before any symptoms appear. Every 3 months from birth (or diagnosis of a risk factor) until the child is 4 years old, an abdominal ultrasound exam and test to check the level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood are done.\n\nSymptoms of hepatoblastoma\n\nChildren may not have symptoms of hepatoblastoma until the tumor has grown bigger. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below:\n\na lump in the abdomen\n\nswelling in the abdomen\n\npain in the abdomen\n\nweight loss for no known reason\n\nloss of appetite\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\nThese symptoms may be caused by conditions other than hepatoblastoma. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor.\n\nTests to diagnose hepatoblastoma\n\nIf your child has symptoms that suggest hepatoblastoma, the doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or to another condition. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them. They will also ask about your child's personal and family medical history and do a physical exam. Based on these results, the doctor may recommend diagnostic tests to find out if your child has hepatoblastoma. The results of these tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.\n\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose hepatoblastoma:\n\nSerum tumor marker test\n\nSerum tumor marker tests measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The blood of children who have liver cancer may have increased amounts of a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) or a protein called AFP. Other cancers, benign liver tumors, and certain noncancer conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, can also increase AFP levels.\n\nSMARCB1 gene testing\n\nSMARCB1 gene testing is a laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for certain changes in the SMARCB1 gene.\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\n\nA sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\n\nthe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets\n\nthe amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells\n\nthe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells\n\nLiver function tests\n\nLiver function tests measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher-than-normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver damage or cancer.\n\nBlood chemistry studies\n\nBlood chemistry studies measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium\n\nMRI uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the liver. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear MRI.\n\nCT scan (CAT scan)\n\nA CT scan uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\n\nIn childhood liver cancer, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen is usually done.\n\nTo learn more, see Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer.\n\nUltrasound exam\n\nAn ultrasound exam is a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. In childhood liver cancer, an ultrasound exam of the abdomen to check the large blood vessels is usually done.\n\nChest x-ray\n\nA chest x-ray is an x-ray of the lungs. An x-ray is a type of high-energy radiation that can go through the body onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\n\nBiopsy\n\nBiopsy is a procedure in which a sample of tissue is removed from the tumor so that a pathologist can view it under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same biopsy procedure.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nImmunohistochemistry uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to check for a certain gene mutation, to help diagnose cancer, and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer. This test may be used to look for changes in the INI1 gene.\n\nGetting a second opinion\n\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your child’s diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child’s cancer.\n\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care. You can contact NCI's Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor.\n\nPrognostic factors for hepatoblastoma\n\nIf your child has been diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis.\n\nThe prognosis for hepatoblastoma depends on the following:\n\nthe PRETEXT group\n\nthe size of the tumor\n\nwhether the type of hepatoblastoma is well-differentiated fetal (pure fetal) or small cell undifferentiated histology\n\nwhether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the diaphragm, lungs, or certain large blood vessels\n\nwhether there is more than one tumor in the liver\n\nwhether the outer covering around the tumor has broken open\n\nhow the cancer responds to chemotherapy\n\nwhether the cancer can be removed completely by surgery\n\nwhether your child can have a liver transplant\n\nwhether the AFP blood levels go down after treatment\n\nyour child's age\n\nwhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has come back after treatment\n\nFor hepatoblastoma that comes back after initial treatment, the prognosis depends on the following:\n\nwhere in the body the tumor recurred\n\nthe type of treatment used to treat the initial cancer\n\nHepatoblastoma may be cured if the tumor is small and can be completely removed by surgery.\n\nNo two people are alike, and responses to treatment can vary greatly. Your child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.\n\nStages of hepatoblastoma\n\nCancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, especially whether the cancer has spread from where it first formed to other parts of the body.\n\nIn hepatoblastoma, the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups are used instead of stage to plan treatment. The results of the tests and procedures done to detect, diagnose, and find out whether the cancer has spread are used to determine the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups.\n\nTwo grouping systems are used for hepatoblastoma to decide whether the tumor can be removed by surgery:\n\nThe PRETEXT group describes the tumor before the patient has any treatment.\n\nThe POSTTEXT group describes the tumor after the patient has had treatment such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nThe liver is divided into four sections for the two grouping systems. The PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer. There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups.\n\nPRETEXT and POSTTEXT group I\n\nIn group I, the cancer is found in one section of the liver. Three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.\n\nPRETEXT and POSTTEXT group II\n\nIn group II, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver. Two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.\n\nPRETEXT and POSTTEXT group III\n\nIn group III, one of the following is true:\n\nCancer is found in three sections of the liver, and one section does not have cancer.\n\nCancer is found in two sections of the liver, and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them.\n\nPRETEXT and POSTTEXT group IV\n\nIn group IV, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver.\n\nProgressive and recurrent hepatoblastoma\n\nHepatoblastoma can be a progressive or refractory disease. Progressive hepatoblastoma is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or worsen. Refractory hepatoblastoma is cancer that no longer responds to treatment.\n\nRecurrent hepatoblastoma is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the liver or as metastatic tumors in other parts of the body. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned in the body, if it has spread, and how far. The type of treatment that your child will have for recurrent hepatoblastoma will depend on how far it has spread.\n\nTo learn more, see Recurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back.\n\nTypes of treatment for hepatoblastoma\n\nThere are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with hepatoblastoma. You and your child's care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has come back.\n\nA pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with hepatoblastoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. It is especially important to have a pediatric surgeon with experience in liver surgery who can send patients to a liver transplant program if needed. This may include the following specialists and others:\n\nYour child's treatment plan will include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible side effects. It will be helpful to talk with your child's care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet, Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents.\n\nSurgery\n\nWhen possible, the cancer is removed by surgery. The types of surgery that may be done are:\n\nPartial hepatectomy removes the part of the liver where cancer is found by surgery. The part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with a small amount of normal tissue around it.\n\nTotal hepatectomy and liver transplant is the removal of the entire liver by surgery, followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor. A liver transplant may be possible when cancer has not spread beyond the liver, and a donated liver can be found. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.\n\nResection of metastases is surgery to remove cancer that has spread outside of the liver, such as to nearby tissues, the lungs, or the brain.\n\nThe type of surgery that can be done depends on the following:\n\nthe PRETEXT group and POSTTEXT group\n\nthe size of the primary tumor\n\nwhether there is more than one tumor in the liver\n\nwhether the cancer has spread to nearby large blood vessels\n\nthe level of AFP in the blood\n\nwhether the tumor can be shrunk by chemotherapy, so that it can be removed by surgery\n\nwhether a liver transplant is needed\n\nChemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove. This is called neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.\n\nWatchful waiting\n\nWatchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient’s condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. In hepatoblastoma, this treatment is only used for small well-differentiated fetal (pure fetal) histology tumors that have been completely removed by surgery.\n\nChemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.\n\nThere are two ways to give chemotherapy to treat hepatoblastoma.\n\nSystemic chemotherapy is chemotherapy that is injected into a vein. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.\n\nRegional chemotherapy is chemotherapy that is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen. When given this way, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas.\n\nChemoembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of regional chemotherapy used to treat hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor, and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine to the liver. This procedure is also called transarterial chemoembolization, or TACE.\n\nChemotherapy drugs used to treat hepatoblastoma include:\n\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\n\nTo learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more, see Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy\n\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group.\n\nHepatoblastoma may be treated with external beam radiation therapy or internal radiation therapy.\n\nExternal radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy is used to treat hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nInternal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.\n\nRadioembolization is a type of internal radiation therapy used to treat hepatoblastoma. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is attached to tiny beads that are injected into the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) through a thin tube called a catheter. The beads are mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the radiation is trapped near the tumor to kill the cancer cells. This is done to shrink the tumor or to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for children with hepatoblastoma.\n\nTo learn more about radiation therapy and its side effects, see External Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer and Radiation Therapy Side Effects.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation therapy\n\nRadiofrequency ablation uses needles inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor. High-energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor, which kills cancer cells. Radiofrequency ablation is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.\n\nClinical trials\n\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.\n\nUse our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nTo learn more, see Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers.\n\nTargeted therapy\n\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific enzymes, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of hepatoblastoma that has come back after treatment.\n\nTo learn more about how targeted therapy works against cancer, what to expect when having targeted therapy, and targeted therapy side effects, see Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer.\n\nTreatment of newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma\n\nTreatment options for newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma that can be removed by surgery at the time of diagnosis may include the following:\n\nsurgery to remove the tumor, followed by combination chemotherapy, for hepatoblastoma that is mixed epithelial and fetal histology (not well-differentiated fetal histology) or aggressive chemotherapy for small cell undifferentiated histology\n\nsurgery to remove the tumor, followed by watchful waiting or chemotherapy, for hepatoblastoma with well-differentiated fetal histology\n\nTreatment options for newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery or is not removed at the time of diagnosis may include the following:\n\ncombination chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the tumor\n\ncombination chemotherapy, followed by a liver transplant\n\nchemoembolization or radioembolization of the hepatic artery to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the tumor\n\nif the tumor in the liver cannot be removed by surgery, but there are no signs of cancer in other parts of the body, the treatment may be a liver transplant\n\nFor newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma that has spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, combination chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumors in the liver and cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. After chemotherapy, imaging tests are done to check whether the tumors can be removed by surgery.\n\nTreatment options may include the following:\n\nIf the tumors in the liver and other parts of the body (usually nodules in the lung) can be removed, surgery will be done to remove the tumors, followed by chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells that may remain.\n\nIf the tumor in other parts of the body cannot be removed, or a liver transplant is not possible, chemotherapy, chemoembolization or radioembolization of the hepatic artery, or radiation therapy may be given.\n\nIf the tumor in other parts of the body cannot be removed, or the patient does not want surgery, radiofrequency ablation may be given.\n\nTreatment options in clinical trials for newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma include the following:\n\na clinical trial of chemotherapy and surgery\n\nSide effects and late effects of treatment\n\nFor information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.\n\nProblems from cancer treatment that begin 6 months or later after treatment and continue for months or years are called long-term or late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\n\nphysical problems that affect liver function or hearing\n\nchanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory\n\nsecond cancers (new types of cancer)\n\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the long-term effects cancer treatment can have on your child. To learn more, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer.\n\nFollow-up care\n\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the treatment group may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\n\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed, or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\n\nCoping with your child's cancer\n\nWhen a child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Taking care of yourself during this difficult time is important. Reach out to your child’s treatment team and to people in your family and community for support. To learn more, see Support for Families When a Child Has Cancer and the booklet Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents."
