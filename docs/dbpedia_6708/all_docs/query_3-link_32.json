        "text": "About twins\n\nWe usually describe twins according to:\n\nhow many eggs they develop from – 1 or 2\n\nwhether they share a placenta in their mother’s womb.\n\nThe main types of twins are fraternal twins and identical twins.\n\nMost twins are born healthy, but a twin pregnancy can mean a higher chance of health complications for you and your babies. If you're pregnant with twins, you and your babies will need extra check-ups.\n\nFraternal twins\n\nAll pregnancies start when a sperm fertilises an egg. This fertilised egg is called a zygote.\n\nSometimes a woman’s ovaries release 2 eggs, and a separate sperm fertilises each egg. This forms twins. These twins are called fraternal twins, dizygotic twins (meaning two zygotes) or non-identical twins.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the developing babies get oxygen and food from their mother through the placentas and umbilical cords. Fraternal twins have separate placentas and umbilical cords. The technical name for this is dichorionic.\n\nFraternal twins can be the same or opposite sex and their genes are as different as any other brother and sister. Often, same-sex fraternal twins look different. For example, they might have different hair or eye colour. Occasionally they look quite similar.\n\nFraternal twins happen in about 70% of twin births in Australia.\n\nVery rarely, fraternal twins share a placenta. These types of twins are called chimaeric twins.\n\nIdentical twins\n\nSometimes a fertilised egg splits within a few days of conception to produce genetically identical twins. Because these twins come from one zygote, they’re also known as monozygotic. Identical twins are the same sex.\n\nThere are 3 types of identical twins.\n\nAbout one-third of identical twins split soon after fertilisation and form completely separate twins. Like fraternal twins, these twins have separate placentas.\n\nThe other two-thirds split after they attach to the wall of the womb. As a result, they share a placenta. The technical name for this is monochorionic.\n\nIn a very small number of identical twins, splitting might happen even later. In this case, both twins share an inner sac, called the amnion, in addition to sharing a placenta. The technical name for this is monoamniotic twins. They’re often called MoMo twins.\n\nIdentical twins happen in around 1 in 250 pregnancies in Australia.\n\nAlthough identical twins have the same genes, they don’t always look the same. This is because children’s health and development are shaped not only by genes but also by experiences in the womb and after birth. For example, a twin who gets less blood from a shared placenta might weigh less at birth.\n\nSharing a placenta or inner sac: why it’s important to know\n\nSharing a placenta means that twins share a blood supply during pregnancy. Sometimes the blood supply is shared unequally, which can cause health problems for both twins.\n\nWomen who are pregnant with twins sharing a placenta need to be checked more often than women who are pregnant with twins with separate placentas. Frequent checks help to pick up any complications early.\n\nTwins sharing an inner sac (monoamniotic) are also at a higher risk of complications during pregnancy because of the chance that their umbilical cords might tangle and cut off their blood supply. These twins are checked even more closely. Medical professionals often recommend that these twins are born at 32-34 weeks. This is earlier than other types of twins, who are generally born at 37-38 weeks.\n\nMedical professionals use ultrasound to work out how many placentas twins have. The earlier the ultrasound, the more accurately it can say how many placentas there are. It gets harder to work out later in pregnancy. After the birth, medical staff will look at the placentas to check what type of twins they are.\n\nFraternal or identical: why it’s important to know\n\nSame-sex twins with separate placentas can be fraternal or identical. For health reasons, it’s good to know whether your twins are fraternal or identical.\n\nTo find out whether twins are identical or fraternal, you can ask for a genetic test after your babies are born. This is called a zygosity test. The test doesn’t hurt and involves collecting a sample of cheek cells by rubbing the inside of your babies’ cheeks with a soft applicator (like a cotton bud). The cost of this test starts at $199 (for both twins) in Australia.\n\nIdentical twins are more likely than fraternal twins to get the same illness. If one of a pair of identical twins is diagnosed with a particular disease or health condition, like high blood pressure, the other twin should be checked often for early symptoms.\n\nBecause of their genetic make-up, identical twins will always be compatible for organ transplantation, if they ever need it. Fraternal twins are compatible only sometimes.\n\nOther reasons why twins and parents of twins might want to know whether they’re fraternal or identical include:\n\ntrying to work out the chance of having more twins in future pregnancies (only fraternal twins run in families)\n\nmaking sure they have the right information about their genetic make-up\n\nbeing able to answer questions from family, friends and others\n\nbeing involved in twin research\n\njust being curious!\n\nSome identical twins are mirror twins – for example, their hair parts on opposite sides, they are oppositely handed, or they have birthmarks on opposite sides of their body. In some rare cases, their internal organs can be mirror images of each other. It’s not known why some twins are like this.\n\nIn very rare cases, twins can be born physically joined together in different ways. These twins, called conjoined twins (previously called Siamese twins), can happen if the fertilised egg splits quite late after fertilisation.\n\nTriplets (1 in 5000 births) and quadruplets (less than 1 in 100 000 births) can develop as a result of combinations of fraternal and identical twinning. There are no reliable figures for quintuplets (5 babies) and sextuplets (6 babies).\n\nMore about twins\n\nIn Australia, twins happen in 1 in every 80 births. This means that 1 in 40 Australians is a twin.\n\nThe birth rate of identical twins is the same around the world and doesn’t vary with the mother’s age.\n\nIn contrast, the birth rate of fraternal twins varies widely across countries and can be influenced by the mother’s age. Women aged over 35 years are the most likely to have fraternal twins, because their ovaries are more likely to release more than one egg at a time."
