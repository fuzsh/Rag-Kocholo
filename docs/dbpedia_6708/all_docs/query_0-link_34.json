I met Michael Moffatt soon after I arrived at Rutgers in the mid-1970s. The faculty was still small enough, and faculty meetings still of enough consequence, that one often encountered colleagues outside one’s own discipline. At that time, Michael was a cultural anthropologist working on South Asia, but he soon turned his attention to student life on the Rutgers campus. Two works followed, The Rutgers Picture Book: An Illustrated History of Student Life in the Changing College and University (1985) and Coming of Age in New Jersey: College and American Culture (1989). I have used both in teaching, and both initiated remarkable discussions among the students about campus life at Rutgers. The other friendship was actually two. Katheryne L. and Richard P. McCormick were among the senior members of the Rutgers community who made me welcome at the university. They took me to my first Rutgers sports event, a women’s basketball game, and invited me to their home. Over the years, Dick recounted stories about the school’s past and gave me copies of his books on Rutgers; my marked-up, dog-eared copy of The Black Student Protest Movement at Rutgers (1990) is one testimony to his generosity. After his retirement, he passed along his unpublished essays on the university’s history. One of those essays, “Going Bigtime, the Rutgers Experience,” on the athletic program, alerted me to just how rich the archival material was for documenting the school’s history. When I first approached this project, my idea was to update McCormick’s 1966 Rutgers: A Bicentennial History. McCormick ended his story in the early 1960s, and while 1966 was a celebratory moment, it provided no particular historical significance point de départ for a sequel. McCormick’s book had as its central theme the transformation of a private college into a university ever more closely tied to state government. That theme seemed equally relevant to any revisiting of the school’s history, but where ix\n\nx • Preface\n\nto begin? In 1864, when the New Jersey legislature selected Rutgers Scientific School rather than Princeton University or the State Normal School at Trenton for the land-grant designation under the federal Morrill Act? In the late nineteenth century, when New Jersey hesitantly and indirectly began funding various aspects of education at Rutgers? Or perhaps at the end of World War I, with the establishment of the state-supported New Jersey College for Women? Instead, this chronicle begins in 1945. World War II transformed America and its relationship to the world, and one of the themes of the work I planned to write was about the way the larger culture shaped what had been fairly insular colleges. Nineteen forty-five was particularly important for two other reasons. First, New Jersey reorganized public education that year and designated Rutgers the State University of New Jersey. Second, Rutgers merged with the University of Newark in 1945; with legislative approval a year later, the new university acquired a geographical reach that has continued to expand into the twenty-first century. Thus, 1945 is the starting point, rather than the better known date of 1956 (when the legislature explicitly defined Rutgers’s relationship to the state and created the Board of Governors, six of whose eleven members were appointed by the governor). Four themes unify this study. One emphasizes the parallels between postwar Rutgers and the development of many other public universities and links those parallels more generally to the nation’s history and, more recently, to the globalization of modern culture. A second theme is that money matters. The school’s accomplishments and deficiencies are directly related to funding—from tuition, from state appropriations, from national research grants, and from corporate and alumni support. Third, the book chronicles changes in the student experience at Rutgers, and the emphasis given that aspect of Rutgers history sets this study apart from other studies of modern universities (and follows the lead of Michael Moffatt). Finally, this work highlights the significance of Edward J. Bloustein’s presidency in changing the trajectory of Rutgers’s history and transforming the school into a major research university (as well as one with aspirations to field big-time athletic teams). Rutgers’s move into the ranks of elite research universities is what is most unique about the school’s contemporary history. Federal and state support for higher education made it inevitable that many of the flagship state schools of the Midwest and West became research universities. Nothing about Rutgers’s past made its future inevi-\n\nPreface • xi\n\ntable. For what was essentially a collection of liberal arts colleges, an effort to play catch-up with schools like Washington, Wisconsin, and Maryland was challenging; to the extent that the enterprise succeeded, much of the explanation lies in the Bloustein presidency. The organization of this book is unusual. The first three chapters trace the history of the university from World War II through the presidency of Richard L. McCormick. They focus on successive presidential administrations and emphasize policies and events that shaped the university. These chapters resemble McCormick’s Bicentennial History most closely (and retell a little of his story). Subsequent chapters are topical. Three of them, including one contributed by my colleague Carla Yanni, emphasize student life; two chapters cover athletics; one deals with aspects of Rutgers’s public recognition; and one explores Rutgers’s path to prominence as a research university. Some of these chapters are subdivided into studies that follow a particular program, organization, or activity across a broad swath of time. The goal of these topical chapters is to retell the postwar Rutgers story from different vantage points, giving more emphasis to the undergraduate experience than is customary in university histories. This is not a comprehensive history. It could never be. Individuals, departments, and schools one might expect to find in the text often go unnamed. Richard P. McCormick realized as he concluded his Bicentennial History that the school was already too large in the 1960s to mention all of its many distinguished individuals and programs in a single volume. The goal has been to focus on the contemporary postwar state university through overviews, illustrative examples, and occasional anecdotes. Some of the chapters I had anticipated writing—about the admissions process, the relationship of the state to the university, university governance— dropped out or were incorporated into other sections. Several of the topics that I discuss deserve fuller treatment—the early history of Livingston College, the Board of Governors, the Bloustein presidency, and the reimagining of urban universities in Camden and Newark. Finally, a modest disclaimer is in order. I have been at Rutgers for forty years, more than half of the period about which I have written. I know and respect many of the individuals whom I discuss, and I have long considered myself a citizen of the university. I teach in the New Brunswick History Department and use it as a case study, but I might equally well have focused on two or three other departments. Over the years, I have attended\n\nxii • Preface\n\nat least one game, match, or meet for virtually every intercollegiate sport in New Brunswick/Piscataway when a student of mine participated. While my personal experience at Rutgers University has been invaluable in the creation of this book, I hope that it has been tempered by my perspective and training as a historian.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI am particularly grateful for the help I have received from my undergraduate assistants from the Aresty Research Center, Alice Chunn, Caitlin Foley, Christa Hannon, Eric Knecht, Sarah Morrison, Rabeya Rahman, Jennifer Stice, and Erin Weinman, as well as graduate student Christina Chiknas.

Carla Yanni\n\nRutgers since 1945\n\n1\n\nBecoming a State University\n\n• The Presidencies of Robert Clothier, Lewis Webster Jones, and Mason Gross\n\nIn 1945, at the end of World War II, “Rutgers” consisted of two small, elite, liberal arts colleges in New Brunswick, both still clinging to their status as private schools, plus some half-developed professional schools. As Rutgers approached its 250th anniversary in 2016, the university had become the state university, a research institution, and a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities. The university now had two law schools, two medical schools, and a firm presence in Camden and Newark as well as in New Brunswick–Piscataway. This chapter explores the beginnings of that transformation, as Rutgers and New Jersey’s residents came to accept the implications of the school’s status as a state university. The narrative that follows highlights what was local, particular, and unique. Yet for all its unique features, Rutgers University followed a trajectory of development in the post–World War II era that paralleled that of many other state universities. This is not surprising, as its development was shaped by external factors—most crucially the national economy and the university’s relationship with the state and federal governments—that affected all of higher education. Thus I begin with, and will return periodically to, the national context. The immediate postwar period was the golden age of higher education. Never before, and perhaps never again, would higher education lay claim to such prestige, popularity, and prosperity—the “three Ps,” as David Thelin calls them, which defined the place of colleges and universities in 1\n\n2 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nAmerican society for a generation of Americans.1 This commitment to higher education was born of a fortuitous conjunction of factors. Americans believed that education would smooth the transition to a postwar economy, provide tools to win the Cold War, and open career paths for an expanding middle class. But beyond any one belief, or the manifestation of that belief in public policy, was a growing sense in the late 1940s and into the 1960s that higher education was vital to American life and an essential priority for the state. The baby boomers inherited that understanding from their parents, and they would be the chief beneficiaries, in terms of access to colleges and universities, of its practical implications. In the years between the end of World War II and the 1970s, the intensified commitment to higher education manifested itself in at least four distinct ways. First, enrollments shot up at universities and colleges throughout the United States. In essence, if the state had previously promised most Americans the opportunity to attend a K–12 school system, the children of the (white) middle class now assumed they would attend college as well. And most of them did so. Second, state governments stepped up their financial support of higher education. Educators knew by the early 1950s that enrollments would skyrocket when the first baby boomers came of age, and these school administrators lobbied incessantly and largely successfully for government funding for additional classroom buildings and more professors. Third, the states reinvigorated or established two-year and community colleges in the hopes that they would provide an affordable transition between high school and a four-year university or at least practical job skills that would make attendance at a four-year institution unnecessary. Each of these factors reflected a national consensus on the importance of educating students beyond their high school years. University faculties, however, not only taught undergraduates but also pursued their research interests. In the 1950s, the federal government did for research what state governments were doing for teaching: supported it generously with taxpayer dollars. Collaboration between university-based scientists and the government—the fourth key factor—had helped win World War II, and the partnership continued after the war, stimulated particularly by the challenge of successful Soviet technological development. Most of this money came from competitive grant programs, using a peer-review system to select the most qualified recipients, and most of it went to researchers at elite universities. The National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and various federal departments\n\nBecoming a State University • 3\n\npoured money into higher education. This money, however, often paid for released time from undergraduate teaching (and thus at times worked at cross-purposes with public policies to improve and expand universities’ teaching programs). Rutgers entered this period still very much a school bound to its past. Essentially a collection of liberal arts colleges, with the little research conducted at the university being carried out at the agricultural and engineering schools, and anxious about its dual identity as both a private and public institution, Rutgers faced a set of political and educational challenges that set it apart from most other state universities. From the outset, school administrators saw the growing demand for admission to college as a positive development. How to meet that demand, however, was problematic. To add classrooms and professors meant getting more state money for operating costs and capital expenditures. Taxpayers had to be convinced that Rutgers really was a public university, their state university in fact, and legislators had to be given greater say in the oversight of the institution. Along the way, university officials, faculty, students, and alumni had to accept that growth—educating a larger proportion of the children of the New Jersey’s middle class—meant jettisoning some of the traditions of the liberal arts colleges that had once defined Rutgers. Rutgers faculty did research, and their careers and identity were shaped by their scholarly commitments, but in the first decades after the war, Rutgers was not a “research university” in the sense that a select few of the most prestigious schools in the United States were becoming. At Rutgers, national trends played out in meeting the expectations of a growing state population that a state school could offer them an affordable and rewarding college education.\n\nThe Administration of Robert Clothier Robert Clothier came to the presidency of Rutgers in 1932, at a time when it was a collection of private colleges supported by tuition revenue and endowment funds but was also an institution, “the State University of New Jersey,” that received state funds dedicated to the Agricultural College, to the New Jersey College for Women (NJCW), and to technical and scientific programs at the men’s college. Organizationally, the public/ private divide created enormous financial and administrative problems; more fundamentally, it embodied an identity crisis that Clothier would face throughout his long tenure as president.\n\n4 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nClothier was born in Philadelphia in 1885, educated at Haverford School, and then attended college at Princeton (where he became editor of the student newspaper, The Princetonian). After graduating, he worked as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and then for the War Department during World War I. After the war, he again served in the private sector before returning to Haverford as headmaster. In 1929, he accepted a position as dean of men at Pittsburgh University, and he remained there until the Board of Trustees elected him president of Rutgers. In Richard P. McCormick’s words, Clothier was “distinguished in appearance, gracious in manner, and warmly sensitive to human relationships,” qualities that made him “especially effective in sustaining the morale of students, faculty, and alumni during an extremely trying period.”2 He was also committed to maintaining the university’s autonomy from state control, even as he accepted the financial imperatives that made some type of educational partnership with the state government a necessity. Before World War II, during the disastrous years of the Great Depression, Clothier oversaw the establishment of a separate graduate faculty, the acquisition of land in Piscataway (then called River Road campus, later the Heights, and today Busch campus), the building of much of the College of Agriculture, the establishment of University College, the founding of the University Press, and the creation of the Department of Alumni and Public Relations (this last step crucial if Rutgers was going to obtain the financial support necessary to remain a largely “private” university). Partnership with the federal Works Progress Administration brought men and money to campus to help construct much-needed new facilities, including a football stadium “dedicated [in 1938] on the occasion of the football victory over Princeton.”3 During World War II, Clothier committed Rutgers to the war effort, welcoming to its campuses the Army Specialized Training Program, which provided short-term technical training to enlisted personnel, and which helped compensate for a precipitous loss of enrollment at the men’s college—but which also meant that “historians, botanists, or classicists struggled with [teaching] classes in mathematics, mechanical engineering, and navigation” made necessary by wartime exigencies.4 At the women’s college, the administration transformed the curriculum to assist the war effort, offering courses that prepared students for everything from language translation and mechanical and engineering work to serving in the Red Cross or USO. Before war’s end, nearly six thousand students of\n\nBecoming a State University • 5\n\nthe colleges served in the armed forces, and more than two hundred would perish in the fighting. The postwar world of the late 1940s brought with it enormous challenges for Rutgers: the uncertainties of a conversion to a peacetime economy, the fears of the Cold War and the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, and, closer to home, the ambiguous relationship of the university to the state. Even before the war ended, Clothier took the initiative in helping to define Rutgers’s position as the state university. Technically, the status “state university” applied only to some of the divisions of Rutgers College, as well as the New Jersey College for Women and the Agricultural College (definitions extending back to 1917, although state financing dated to well before that). The state responded positively to Clothier’s request, and in 1945, the legislature enacted a bill designating Rutgers’s multiple units collectively the state university and, even more critically, placing them in a coordinate rather than a subordinate relationship to the New Jersey State Board of Education. The school, now an “instrumentality of the state,” gained in status without losing its autonomy.5 There had been significant opposition. Some came from a taxpayers’ association. Other critics questioned the school’s religious status (Rutgers had, in fact, ended its ties to the Dutch Reformed Church in 1920) and asked why state funds could not be used for Catholic schools (meaning Seton Hall) as well. Such opposition was ineffective in blocking the legislation; but in the next legislative initiative, a state construction bond issue, this opposition would triumph. Before the bond referendum, however, the trustees expanded the university in a way that had important long-term consequences. During the Great Depression, the trustees had considered purchasing several colleges in Newark (known as the “Dana group”) to add to the presence the university already had in the city, but nothing came of the idea initially. These schools had subsequently become the University of Newark, and despite grumblings from some trustees about acquiring an urban university, Clothier moved decisively in 1946 to merge the schools. Rutgers acquired a law, business, and pharmacy school, and a college of arts and sciences—altogether about two thousand students and a converted brewery that served as a classroom building. In 1950, Rutgers acquired the two-year “College of South Jersey” (later Rutgers-Camden), a much smaller institution than Newark, and incorporated its unaccredited law program under the umbrella of the Newark school.\n\n6 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nIn 1947, Rutgers began to work for a state bond referendum to finance construction on its three principal campuses. These were years of heady enrollment growth, a result of the passage of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 (the G.I. Bill), which helped pay the costs of college for returning veterans, and of growing ambitions to develop the research potential of the school. Perhaps even more important, Clothier and the board had come to realize that the university’s capital needs could not be met without substantial state aid. The bond referendum that the state approved and the electorate considered was a $50 million proposal that would aid not only Rutgers but the state colleges and welfare agencies as well. The opposition focused on Rutgers and challenged its legitimacy as a public university. The opposition won. In the November 1948 election, with a turnout of more than a million people casting ballots, the referendum lost by more than eighty thousand votes. The rejection was, again in McCormick’s words, “a multiple catastrophe for the University.”6 Defeat signaled a lack of public acceptance of the 1945 effort to gain public support without giving up the autonomy of a private institution. It left the university with mounting deficits from its own borrowing to expand its facilities and without any way to improve its inadequate faculty salaries. Most serious, it undercut efforts to prepare for the baby boomers. Rutgers administrators knew that by the mid-1960s far more young people would want a college education, and the school was now handicapped in building the dormitories and classrooms to accommodate these students. In January 1951, Robert Clothier retired. He had shepherded Rutgers through the Great Depression and World War II; now he was sixty-six years old and in poor health. He reminded the Board of Trustees that they faced great challenges: the war in Korea, the looming Cold War, fiscal retrenchment occasioned by the defeat of the bond issue, and the misguided efforts to surrender Rutgers’s autonomy to the state. He praised the “partnership” that had developed between the university and the state government but cautioned that Rutgers “must never yield its freedom from political control.”7\n\nThe Administration of Lewis Webster Jones On September 7, 1951, the Board of Governors, at a special meeting presided over by New Jersey governor Alfred Driscoll, appointed Lewis Webster Jones to replace Clothier as university president. Jones had administrative\n\nBecoming a State University • 7\n\nbackground at a liberal arts college and a state university, which put him in a good position to meet the challenges of Rutgers’s rapidly evolving mission. Born in Nebraska in 1899, Jones attended Reed College (noted for its innovative liberal arts curriculum) as an undergraduate, and obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the Robert Brookings Graduate School. He worked as an economist in Europe before joining the faculty at Bennington College, a northeastern liberal arts institution, in 1932. He served as the school’s president from 1941 until 1947, when he left to take a similar post at the University of Arkansas. He would be the first Rutgers president to embrace the challenge of defining what it meant to be the state university. This, of course, was what the trustees expected him to do; but no one could have anticipated the way in which the intrusion of Cold War politics into the academic life of the campus would also define his presidency. Soon after his arrival, Jones laid out his approach to education in a series of speeches, including one in May 1952 at his inauguration to an audience that included New Jersey political leaders. Beginning with the premise that the United States was engaged in “a war of ideas and moral values”—which referenced both the Cold War and the destructive “current mood of fear and distrust” within America—Jones proposed a cooperative task that would link the university to the citizens of the state, to bring “knowledge and reason to bear on the conduct of our daily lives.”8 He pointed to such recent achievements as the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike and the drafting of a new state constitution as evidence of what that meant. Jones worried that modern culture was mass culture, and that subordination of the individual to the will of mass culture was the “essence of barbarism”—a leveling down toward mediocrity rather than up toward excellence of America.9 Unlike the conservative thinkers he cited, however, Jones believed that higher education could and must reverse this trend. Colleges need not turn out “dangerously skilled barbarians”; they could provide “an education which deliberately sets out to teach students that civilization is their responsibility.”10 As general as these themes were, they forecast how the Cold War and the emergent partnership between the state and the university would shape Jones’s administration. More concretely, Jones warned of the coming crisis that a growing population posed for higher education: “As a nation, we are in the position of parents who, having prepared for one baby, are blessed with triplets. Our joy, like theirs, is not unmixed with consternation.”11 He affirmed the state university’s commitment to educating the majority, not merely the elite,\n\n8 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nand to providing opportunity, with state scholarship support, for women and men, all races and all religions—a point which, however obvious today, did not seem so at the time. He applauded the leadership Rutgers had shown as a land grant school in making New Jersey agriculture as productive as any in the nation; he emphasized that the Newark and Camden campuses would require resources to serve their students; he suggested the role television might play in educating a growing student population; and he asked for better educational opportunities for citizens sixty years of age and older. Three interrelated issues defined much of Jones’s presidency: the effort to obtain from the state adequate resources to support the school’s mission as the state university; the undertaking of a substantial building program (often without the state aid the university needed) in order to prepare the university for the explosion in enrollments in the next decade; and a decisive move to redefine and strengthen the relationship between the university and the state. As Jones assumed the presidency, four major building projects were already under construction or completed: a new chemistry building financed by the state was dedicated just as Jones took office, while royalties from the drug streptomycin, developed in the laboratory of Selman A. Waksman, underwrote the construction of the Institute of Microbiology, completed in 1953. Both buildings were at the Heights (Busch campus). Demarest Hall, a muchneeded new dormitory at the men’s college, was dedicated in 1951, and the same year, construction began on a student center at the NJCW. Both buildings were the result of the first serious capital campaign undertaken by the university since the post–World War I era, and the NJCW construction, in particular, was the result of fund-raising efforts of alumnae of the NJCW, working with the New Jersey State Federation of Women’s Clubs. The university had also acquired the buildings of the College of South Jersey, and was beginning modest classroom additions to that campus. Other notable building projects included the construction of three ninestory (six floors of rooms) dormitories, Frelinghuysen, Hardenbergh, and Livingston (later, Campbell), on a narrow strip of land adjacent to the Raritan River canal, each with classrooms in the basements in an effort to integrate living and learning; the beginning of the Neilson Campus complex at Douglass College (which in 1955 had changed its name from the New Jersey College for Women), which would provide housing for almost five hundred women when completed in 1960; and the “Ledge” student center\n\nBecoming a State University • 9\n\nat the College for Men. In each case, the university gambled by borrowing money to construct what it hoped would be self-liquidating projects (the loans to be paid off through student rent payments). A state appropriation of $2 million began the construction of a much-needed new library, and a second appropriation of the same amount allowed for its completion, while additional capital appropriations went toward a library for the College of South Jersey, the law center at Newark, and an agricultural sciences building. As valuable as these additions were, and as creative as the university was in financing new construction, the efforts had to be weighed against the anticipated capital needs of almost $45 million, as detailed in a report for the Board of Trustees in 1954—money that was essential to meet the surge in admissions, which was expected to push undergraduate enrollment from a little under the current five thousand to nineteen thousand by 1970. Complicating the university’s response to the anticipated enrollment surge was the defeat, previously discussed, of the 1948 higher education bond issue, and the subsequent defeat in 1954 of a bond issue to support a state medical and dental college. In the latter instance, the plan for a state medical school had been initiated by Governor Robert Meyner, but when it became apparent that Rutgers would be the home of the new medical college, opposition arose in Essex County. Jersey City had hoped that its financially distressed medical center would become the new state medical school, but when it became clear that this would not happen, it offered the center to Seton Hall University, which then announced the creation of a new state medical school before the bond issue went before the voters, and the measure went down to defeat. Rough-and-tumble New Jersey politics took their toll on the state university, but they also pointed to a larger problem, exploited adroitly by the university’s political opponents. Despite becoming a public institution in 1945, Rutgers was not clearly perceived as the New Jersey state university in the mid-1950s. This fact lay behind key institutional changes initiated in 1955. During the early 1950s, the trustees had experimented with several reconfigurations of university governance, all designed to give the school a more efficient organizational structure. In 1955, radical surgery replaced mere tinkering. The trustees, tied legally and historically to Rutgers College, were not abolished, but overall control of the university passed to a new, much smaller body, the Board of Governors, six of whose eleven voting members were to be appointed by New Jersey’s governor. The uni-\n\n10 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nversity’s budget would now go to the State Board of Education (as well as the legislature). The trustees themselves became a smaller body, with more limited powers, and acted in an advisory capacity on most matters. The last historic links with the Dutch Reformed Church were severed, as was the tie with Rutgers Preparatory School. A court case and a legislative act secured the legitimacy of the arrangements, and in August 1956, the new Board of Governors met for the first time. Put simply, the creation of the Board of Governors gave the state of New Jersey a larger role in the university, and gave the alumni, the link to the past (and still heavily represented on the Board of Trustees), a reduced role. But for many state residents, the defining moment of Jones’s presidency was the university’s response to the Cold War. Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union had existed even while the nations had been military partners during World War II; when Harry S. Truman replaced Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, these tensions rapidly escalated, beginning with disagreements over postwar Poland, and continuing almost unabated through the mid-1960s and the Cuban missile crisis. Truman asked the American people to approve the continued funding of military expansion as a protection against Soviet communism. He coupled this in 1947 with an order leading to loyalty investigations of all federal employees. Ultimately, more than three million Americans were investigated, and while many would be fired as “security risks” for alcoholism or homosexuality, very few were found guilty of disloyalty or Communist Party membership. Anticommunism had been a part of American political culture since the end of World War I, drawing strength from deeply committed anticommunist crusaders and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but in the late 1940s, it became a national obsession, supported by both conservatives and liberals, by Democrats as well as Republicans, and orchestrated not only by federal congressional committees but also by state and local actions to expose and root out communists and destroy the credibility of fellow travelers whose past or present liberal commitments defined them as soft on communism. The anticommunist crusade came quickly to American campuses. While public universities were supposedly constrained in investigating their employees by constitutional protection for free speech and a tradition of academic freedom, these same institutions were particularly vulnerable to pressure from state legislators, who controlled their purse strings. In late 1948, Norman Ledgin wrote in a Targum column titled “Campus Witch Hunts Can’t Happen Here,” that “Tom Paine and Sam Adams would re-\n\nBecoming a State University • 11\n\ncoil in horror if they could view” the “great fear” that was sweeping across American colleges.12 He praised President Robert Clothier for standing against the hysteria. At Rutgers, however, the process of adjusting to Cold War realities actually began in late 1950, under Clothier. A special committee of faculty, trustees, and alumni, headed by Congressman Clifford Case, revised the school’s by-laws to include a new statute on academic freedom. The statement upheld the right of the faculty member to express scholarly opinions, however controversial, in the classroom, but noted a professor’s special obligations as a citizen and representative of the university when making public statements that could reflect on the school. In short order, this statement would be used against professors who claimed a federal Fifth Amendment right not to speak about possible Communist Party involvement. Among the most prominent investigations of communist influence in public life was the one carried out by Pat McCarren’s Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS). McCarren focused initially on the Institute for Pacific Relations (IPR), a think tank that supported much of the best research on the Far East, but which McCarren believed was infiltrated with communists, working to destroy the U.S. relationship with Nationalist China. In the course of the hearings, witnesses named Rutgers-Newark classics professor Moses I. Finley as the organizer in the 1930s of a communist discussion group at Columbia University. Finley’s name had previously arisen in a New York State investigation of communism in New York City schools, and it came up again when McCarren turned his attention to communist influence in the schools. Having been identified as a communist by others, Finley now found himself subpoenaed to testify before the SISS. So was a second Rutgers professor, Simon Heimlich, who taught mathematics at the School of Pharmacy, and whose name had come up in an earlier House Committee on Un-American Activities (popularly known as HUAC) hearing. Rutgers did not respond initially to the news of Finley’s appearance. Finley, an untenured but widely respected member of the faculty, discussed the matter with the administration and denied in person and in writing that he had ever been a communist. At the congressional hearing, he stated he was not a communist but pled the Fifth Amendment in response to questions about former party membership. Heimlich interpreted his summoning as an attack on academic freedom and resolutely refused to cooperate with the committee. For the anticommunist investigators and\n\n12 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nfor much of the public, pleading the Fifth Amendment was virtually an admission of guilt, but based on recent events, most notably the Alger Hiss case, witnesses had reason to worry that an assertion that they had never been communists, if contradicted by other witnesses, could form the basis of a perjury indictment. To the SISS neither case was particularly important, as neither professor had anything to do with IPR, but when the local press latched on to the case and Republican governor Alfred Driscoll called for the university to do something, President Jones acted. He released Heimlich’s passionate defense of his position to the public and created a special committee (again, of faculty, trustees, and alumni) to investigate the matter and report to him. Tracy Voorhees, a trustee prominently associated with efforts to block communist expansion in Europe, was appointed chair of the committee, which informed Jones that a refusal to testify about former communist membership fell under the 1950 by-law revisions. Jones then appointed a faculty committee to consider the charges against Finley and Heimlich. The committee, as Ellen Schrecker notes in her study of the case, took its role as a “grand jury” seriously and grounded itself in the history and purpose of the Fifth Amendment, before reporting to Jones that nothing the professors had done constituted “misconduct” and that the special responsibilities which the by-laws imposed on them as professors were matched by their heightened vulnerability to public criticism. The professors did not win this battle. A little over a week later, the Board of Trustees (with Governor Driscoll in attendance) voted unanimously to dismiss Finley and Heimlich. In a statement issued in January 1952 interpreting the board’s action, Jones drew a distinction between the freedom to be silent, as a civil right protected by the government, and academic freedom, which included a responsibility to provide rational explanations to public authorities. Pointing to the ongoing Cold War, Jones continued: “Under all the circumstances of our relations to world communism, a minimum responsibility would seem to be that members of the University state frankly where they stand on matters of such deep public concern, and of such relevance to academic integrity, as membership in the Communist party, even when by a straightforward statement they believe they might incur certain personal risks.”13 The policy of immediate dismissal for pleading the Fifth Amendment claimed a third victim. In February 1953, Richard Schlatter, a distinguished historian at the New Brunswick campus, and Abraham Glasser, a tenured\n\nBecoming a State University • 13\n\nmember of the Newark law faculty, were subpoenaed by HUAC. Schlatter, who had been a communist at Harvard during the 1930s and later left the party, testified willingly (but with considerable personal anguish) and suffered no professional consequences at Rutgers. In 1941, Glasser had resigned “without prejudice” from a position in the Justice Department (and found work in another federal agency) after he had given information about the Spanish Civil War to a man thought to be a Soviet agent. That record, probably leaked to subsequent employers by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had come up several times, and led to his being subpoenaed. Glasser was combative throughout his appearance, and pled the Fifth Amendment to numerous questions. The law school faculty committee reviewing the case found no reason not to apply the new policy; offered a choice of resigning or being fired, Glasser resigned. Pressure to revisit all three of the cases mounted over the remainder of Jones’s presidency, but neither the Board of Trustees nor the Board of Governors ever voted to reconsider Glasser’s forced resignation or the earlier cases of Heimlich and Finley. Rutgers was censured by both the American Association of University Professors (April 1956) and the Association of American Law Schools (December 1957). The university, in turn, questioned the application to its decision of standards that neither association had endorsed at the height of Cold War anticommunism in the early 1950s, but it also revised its regulations on academic freedom and eliminated the “immediate dismissal” provision. Shortly thereafter, the AAUP removed its censure and suggested that the university revisit the cases (which it did not do). What can one conclude about this controversy, which spanned Jones’s years as Rutgers president? In the 1950s, many liberals and humanists— and Jones was both—were as deeply committed, on their own terms, to fighting the Cold War as were the anticommunist crusaders of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, HUAC, and SISS. In his public statements, Jones defended academic freedom, albeit in less than absolute terms, and he would have fought to protect Heimlich, Finley, and Glasser if they had cooperated with federal investigatory bodies. He clearly valued Finley as a member of the Rutgers faculty (as he did Richard Schlatter), and after Finley was dismissed, recommended him for a position at Cambridge University in England. Moreover, Jones, even more than the Board of Trustees, worked to assure “due process” protection to faculty members. At the same time, he believed that membership in the Communist Party was itself\n\n14 • Rutgers since 1945\n\ngrounds for dismissal, or as he stated in his inaugural address, “We cannot of course tolerate conspirators who claim the university’s protection in order to destroy freedom.”14 If the trustees drew a line in the sand over the issue of pleading the Fifth Amendment, Jones articulated the defense of that policy, and then engaged in an effort to assure that politicians, the press, and educational leaders nationwide would hear his views. Public pressure, from the press and the governor’s office, might have forced Rutgers to respond to the fact that first Finley and then Heimlich pled the Fifth Amendment in Senate hearings, but the path that Jones and the board followed, they set themselves. Jones clearly worked in harmony with the trustees but not with the faculty. Faculty protest over the dismissal of Heimlich and Finley was shortlived, and not unanimous, but nonetheless substantial; after all, the faculty committee’s unanimous decision had been ignored. The University Assembly—an all-faculty group—met less than a week after the board decision, and with perhaps 40 percent of the faculty in attendance, heard from Tracy Voorhees, debated the recent events, and then voted on four resolutions, three of which supported the initial faculty recommendation. The assembly endorsed, by a vote of 182–104, the initial report of the faculty committee of review, which had recommended that no action be taken against the two faculty members who pled the Fifth Amendment. Balancing that vote was a second, passed 205–41, to endorse the board’s statement that there was no place in the faculty for a communist. There was general agreement that the faculty and board needed to revisit the university policy on academic freedom independently of the current cases. The assembly then conducted a poll of the entire faculty, in which 583 out of 690 members of the university community participated. On this ballot, the vote to support the initial faculty recommendation was closer (312–261, with 10 abstaining), and a vote to ask the trustees to reconsider was closer still, but support for the board’s statement that communists were not qualified to teach at Rutgers was overwhelming (520–52, with 11 abstaining). An emergency committee of faculty members—which included historian Richard P. McCormick, economist Broadus Mitchell, and Willard Heckel of the Newark Law School—drafted a statement challenging the board’s handling of the firings, and then pled their case at an emotional board meeting in late January 1953. Soon thereafter, attention turned to the much more protracted case of Abraham Glasser, but the confrontation had defined the parameters of academic commitment both to free speech and to anticommunism,\n\nBecoming a State University • 15\n\nand left a residue of distrust between the university’s administration and its faculty that the next president would work hard to correct. In mid-August 1958, Jones unexpectedly submitted his resignation to the Board of Governors and accepted a new position as director of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. In his final address, given at the fall convocation, he reported on the “encouraging progress” Rutgers had made during his presidency. The campus was “rejuvenated, handsome, self-confident, instead of down-at-the-heel and apologetic”; and new buildings had been built, or were sprouting up—men’s and women’s dorms, the horticulture and biology buildings, the Ledge and the study center at Douglass.15 He also cited the new professional schools for social work and library science, the world renown achieved by the Institute of Microbiology, and the growing recognition of the University Press. His frustrations with gaining adequate state support, however, overshadowed these accomplishments. In states like Michigan and California, Jones argued, public officials understood that great universities were an asset to be nurtured, and the teaching and research at these schools differed in kind from what went on at other institutions. “Don’t settle for mediocrity,” he warned the students (and through them, the state), “and for Heaven’s sake don’t plan for it.”16 Jones hardly mentioned Newark or South Jersey, a common oversight in this era, and he did not reflect on the controversy over academic freedom.\n\nThe Administration of Mason Gross When Jones announced his resignation, the Board of Governors turned to Mason Gross, the provost and vice president, as acting president, and in February 1959, the board unanimously voted him the sixteenth president of Rutgers. Born in Connecticut in 1911 and educated at Cambridge University, Gross returned to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. in philosophy under Alfred North Whitehead at Harvard University. He became an instructor at Columbia University, but after America’s entry into World War II, he enlisted and served in the Army Intelligence Corps. Returning to Columbia briefly when the war ended, he moved to Rutgers in 1946 as a philosophy professor and assistant to the dean of arts and sciences. Just three years later, he became Rutgers’s first provost, appointed to assist President Clothier, and he remained in that position until he became president himself.\n\n16 • Rutgers since 1945\n\n1.

Source: R-Photo, presidential photographs.\n\nMason Gross came to the presidency with several advantages. As the university was still quite small, Gross knew many of the New Brunswick faculty personally. His teaching, which he continued as president, and his earlier involvement with student affairs, made him sensitive to the concerns of undergraduates in an era when undergraduates would increasingly demand to be heard. He also had more than a decade of experience with the university’s complex organizational structure and the benefit of President Jones’s efforts to anticipate the coming surge in enrollments and to convince New Jersey to take seriously its responsibility to the state university. Finally, Gross served in an era when the American people and their elected officials regarded higher education as the foundation for America’s future—a golden age for public universities, even if budget struggles did not make it seem so at the time. Gross’s inaugural address challenged the university and the state to think more creatively about education. He chose as his theme the need to understand the vitality and significance of the cultures of Africa and the Middle and Far East. Framing the talk implicitly in terms of the Cold War struggle in these regions, he asked why Americans “seem to be completely baffled by the discovery that in many parts of the world, the very\n\nBecoming a State University • 17\n\nnotion that something is Western is cause for dislike.” Americans throw back at these peoples an “arsenal of clichés” when they would be better served by working to create “fresh intellectual vigor” in their own educational system.17 In another address, early in his tenure as president, Gross reflected on the notion of “excellence,” a term that was to become a keyword in defining higher education in the decades to follow. He found it, he said, in both musical performance and athletic endeavor, both of which were central to higher education; but, more generally, in creative activity, which “evokes in you directly a sense of tremendous excitement and joy.”18 The seriousness of the times—and here he mentioned the “Communist menace,” Laos and Berlin, Castro and Trujillo—only made the freedom of the individual even more crucial, and that freedom, Gross said, is a “joyous notion.”19 Both these talks recast the meaning of education in ways that students and faculty members would be debating during the 1960s; but Gross was equally committed, just as Jones had been, to keeping the coming demographic crisis in higher education in the eyes of the state’s citizens and officials. What might hit other states by 1970, would hit New Jersey, Gross predicted, by 1965: unprecedented demands for admissions and resources inadequate to meet those demands. He warned that New Jersey had been rendered “educationally impoverished” and “culturally almost bankrupt” by policies that left the welfare of its citizens dependent on the universities, theaters, orchestras, and museums of New York and Pennsylvania.20 Gross’s tenure saw the university and the state make a massive commitment to educating more students. In 1958–1959, the year Gross became president, Rutgers enrolled almost seven thousand undergraduates and just over two thousand graduate students; the admissions office projected that ten years later the undergraduate population would be more than eighteen thousand students, and the graduate population over five thousand. The challenge of preparing for this wave of students was met in part by new capital construction, funded by three state bond issues. In November 1959, voters passed a $66.8 million bond issue by a comfortable margin (Rutgers’s share was $29.8 million), after the university spearheaded a campaign that enlisted numerous faculty speakers and drew broad-based support from labor unions, civic organizations, and religious bodies. In 1964, voters added a $40.1 million education bond issue (Rutgers gained $18.8 million); and in 1968, despite worries about a backlash against campus disruptions nationwide and at the culmination of a tight race for the presidency\n\n18 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nbetween Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, the New Jersey electorate overwhelmingly approved $990 million in new bonds, $202.5 million of which went to educational institutions, including $62.8 million for Rutgers. Rutgers’s effort to win public approval for the bonds, the spread of the largess across the state to its many colleges, and a general sense that “education mattered” help explain this set of triumphs for the state university. These bond issues, coupled with federal loans, grants, and gifts, transformed the university. In Newark, where classes and offices were located in twenty-one scattered buildings, none of which had been originally designed for educational use, the university acquired twenty acres of blighted downtown land from the city and began to build, aided by a federal urban renewal grant. A new law center (Ackerson Hall), a library, humanities building (Conklin Hall), science building (Seth Boyden Hall), and student center were followed eventually by the Graduate School of Business Administration, a fine arts building, and a gymnasium. In Camden, at the College of South Jersey, a new student center and a science building were erected, followed by additional instructional buildings, a law school building, and a gymnasium. As dramatic as this building program was, far less bond money was devoted to it than to the New Brunswick–Piscataway campuses. Camden students and faculty protested that they were being shortchanged. Later, when greater efforts to attract more black students to Rutgers began, the Newark faculty petitioned unsuccessfully for a greater share of the 1968 bond money to meet anticipated enrollment increases. In New Brunswick, a new four-dorm complex on “Bishop campus” (Clothier, Brett, Tinsley, and Mettler) was added to the three recently built “river dorms”—allowing the men’s college, limited to eight hundred students in the mid-1950s, to provide rooms for more than twenty-eight hundred students. The gymnasium was enlarged, a new classroom building (Scott Hall) and dining hall (Brower) were constructed, a language lab was situated behind Van Dyck Hall, and the Graduate School of Education building was completed on the opposite side of Voorhees Mall. More modest additions to Douglass added dormitories and a dining hall on the Neilson campus as well as a new library and gymnasium (Loree). The third bond issue underwrote construction of a classroom and office building (Hickman) and a food science building on the adjacent campus of the College of Agriculture. In large measure, the New Brunswick campuses that would welcome students at the beginning of the twenty-first century were now in place.\n\nBecoming a State University • 19\n\nWhat happened in Piscataway, across the Raritan River, was even more dramatic. At the Heights (Busch campus), major additions were made to the existing science buildings: the Nelson Biological Laboratories were begun in April 1959, followed by a physics building and an engineering complex. The second bond issue paid for the Library of Science and Medicine, while corporate donations and federal funds helped construct a building for the College of Pharmacy (moved from Newark). The third bond issue provided for a mathematics, statistics, and computer building (Hill Center), additions to the Wright chemistry building, and a psychology building. The new Library of Science and Medicine and the pharmacy building complemented the two-year medical school that the state authorized Rutgers to establish and which graduated its first, small class in spring 1968. Just to the east of the Heights lay Camp Kilmer, owned by the federal government. Since the end of World War II, much of the 1,500-plus acres were no longer being used, and Rutgers acquired 540 of those acres in the early 1960s to build Livingston College and fulfill a vision of multiple liberal arts colleges within a larger university, what was called a “federated college system.” The fourth component of the federated system was the newly (1965) renamed College of Agriculture and Environmental Science, and the fifth was University College (which offered extension courses and served primarily the needs of older, returning students). In fall 1967, Rutgers submitted to the state a prioritized building list for 1969–1974 that included ninety-five new projects, more than half of them new buildings, the remainder additions or land acquisitions, which had a combined price tag of more than $300 million. In President Gross’s last year in office, 1970–1971, Rutgers had six projects under way costing more than $36 million, plus five new ones that cost an additional $16 million, and seven projects on the drawing board that would require about $20 million. Many of these new buildings were to be built on the Camden or Newark campuses. The other aspect of the story of the university’s financial expansion was contained in the operating budget. When Mason Gross became president, Rutgers had a budget of $28.2 million, of which $12.2 came from state appropriations. In 1970–1971, the year in which Gross announced his retirement, the total operating budget was $115 million, and the state contributed $57 million. Yet every year Rutgers had received less than it had requested, and every year Gross had argued that Rutgers had a great deal of catching\n\n20 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nup to do as a “state university which was grafted on the sturdy but admittedly ill-equipped and relatively small institution which was Rutgers in 1945.”21 The appeals had stressed the need for more faculty, more competitive salaries, and more resources for the libraries. Thanks to Gross’s insistence, academic salaries had risen enough by the late 1960s that the American Association of University Professors rating of Rutgers salary scales had changed from “C” to “A.” Better salaries, in turn, gave Rutgers the ability to attract and retain a faculty that would enhance the academic reputation of the school under Gross’s leadership. Of all the projects that marked the Gross presidency, two endeavors stand out. One was the development of a medical school. In June 1961, Gross announced that, after a long period of planning, a $1 million grant had been obtained from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation that would allow Rutgers to establish a two-year program of medical education. Existing biology programs were strengthened, and new departments in anatomy, pathology, and pharmacology were created, with the necessary buildings added to the science complex on the Heights. Within the year, DeWitt Stetten Jr., a biochemist and specialist on arthritis, had been recruited from the National Institutes of Health as the first dean. Provisional accreditation was obtained in 1963. Even before construction began on the $16 million core building at the Heights, the first group of students was admitted in fall 1966; they studied in temporary quarters at the Heights and on Kilmer campus. In 1968, all fifteen graduates of that first class were accepted to four-year schools. Meanwhile, the state approved a plan to make the Rutgers Medical School a four-year institution by 1972, and the university entered into negotiations to purchase Raritan Valley Hospital as the site for the clinical facilities needed for the school. Then, abruptly, everything fell apart. Following the recommendation of Governor William Cahill, the New Jersey legislature moved to sever the medical school from the university and place it under a stand-alone board that governed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (NJCMD). Cahill expressed concerns about the small number of graduates of the Rutgers school and high cost of the planned hospital construction. He complained that leaving the medical school as a part of Rutgers would mean “perpetuating a system which says only academic geniuses can become doctors” and not produce enough graduates who were committed to general practice rather than academic research.22 There were, however,\n\nBecoming a State University • 21\n\nother factors at play. The move had the backing of political leaders in Essex County, where NJCMD was located, and it also came at a time when the state and the university were squabbling over the school’s fiscal autonomy and its handling of student antiwar protests. At least some legislators supported the move as a rebuke to what they perceived as Gross’s mismanagement of the university, and Gross’s own testimony in Trenton could do nothing to stop the political steamroller Cahill had set in motion. Rutgers’s fledgling medical school became part of the NJCMD. A poignant footnote: in 1970, the new medical school building and the adjacent, recently constructed Library of Science and Medicine, both virtually empty shells, now stood side by side on the Heights campus, their umbilical cord severed. Rutgers designated the door facing away from the medical school as the library’s front door, and the tunnel connecting the two structures was sealed off, with each institution retaining a key to its own entrance only. It would take almost a decade to iron out—imperfectly—the formal and informal relationship between the two institutions, and another half century for Rutgers to reclaim the lost opportunity of building a research university around a medical school. The other major undertaking was the creation of Livingston College. In early 1965, Ernest A. Lynton, who had joined the physics faculty in 1952, was appointed dean of the first (and as it turned out, the only) college to be built on the Kilmer property. Over the next four years, Lynton recruited the nucleus of a new faculty, and he involved students and professors from the men’s and women’s colleges in planning the new school. The planners wanted to decentralize education, even as Rutgers itself grew into a large state university; they wanted a curriculum that would engage students from the start with the problems of the contemporary world; and they wanted to create physical spaces that would connect learning and living. Moreover, unlike Rutgers and Douglass Colleges, the new school was coeducational. The curriculum emphasized technology (computer science) and an interdisciplinary approach to the urban experience as pathways to making education relevant to modern life, while still including most of the traditional liberal arts disciplines. Livingston College was also distinguished by a successful effort to recruit a cross-section of the New Jersey population (more than a quarter of the entering class of 1969 was classified as nonwhite) and to incorporate students as partners in academic decision making. Over the next decade, the challenge of meeting and redefining these goals made Livingston the center of both internal and external controversy.\n\n22 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nIn spring 1959, as Gross assumed the presidency, national commentators paused for troubled reflections on the apathy and apolitical currents that they sensed had long washed over college campuses. Yet that same semester, Rutgers College students presented to the Board of Governors a “Declaration of Student Rights,” signed by virtually every student leader, and the student council continued its campaign to end the mandatory Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program. However one might characterize the 1950s, from this point on, activism trumped apathy. During the 1960s, Rutgers students challenged in loco parentis rules and traveled to Cuba; they joined the Peace Corps, protested the Vietnam War and campus racism, fought for a greater say in college and university governance, and debated the fraternity system as well as attended the campus appearance of such national figures as black leader Malcolm X, socialist spokesman Norman Thomas, Republican politician Barry Goldwater, and southern conservative Strom Thurmond. No student concern loomed larger than the Vietnam War. Even before President Lyndon Johnson’s March 1965 commitment of American marines to combat operations in Southeast Asia, Rutgers campuses had active left- and right-wing student groups engaged in debate about national issues. In the mid-1960s, both the Young Americans for Freedom (a conservative/libertarian student group that grew out of a 1960 meeting in Sharon, Connecticut, the home of conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr.) and the Students for a Democratic Society (founded at the University of Michigan in the same year and initially defined by the 1962 “Port Huron Statement” drafted by left-wing activist Tom Hayden) had active chapters on all three campuses, although initially the YAF concerned itself primarily with anticommunism, and SDS with community empowerment and organizing. Then came the “teach-in.” Convoked by the faculty, held in Scott Hall on the New Brunswick campus, and running through the night on Thursday, April 22, 1965, Rutgers’s first teach-in, which drew perhaps a thousand students and numerous faculty speakers, probed the historical origins and current political significance of what was, at that time, only a modest American commitment to supporting a pro-Western regime in South Vietnam from attacks by communist insurgents. As the Targum reported afterward, some students came for the novelty of the event, some for “a chance to be with girls all-night. Some came to learn. Some needed an excuse to cut classes the next day.” The highlight for most was a fiery debate be-\n\nBecoming a State University • 23\n\ntween a Douglass political science professor, William Fitzpatrick, and two Rutgers College history professors, Lloyd Gardner and Warren Susman. Fitzpatrick argued that “we are fighting in Vietnam not to save our ‘little brown brother,’ but to save ourselves,” and Gardner in what the Targum described as a scorching retaliation countered that “Western civilization was greatest when isolated to the size of Greek city-states, and failed most miserably when it reached out to take lands it was not entitled to take.”23 As Fitzpatrick spoke in rebuttal, the Targum captured what happened next: “At this point, Susman apparently had heard enough, and, as he later said, went blind with rage. He jumped up from his chair, raced over to the podium where Fitzpatrick was speaking, quizzed Fitzpatrick as to ‘How would you define it?’ referring to ‘civilization,’ and pounded his fist on the podium four times, smashing his watch in the process. It appeared that either Susman would burst a blood vessel, or the podium would crumble.”24 One had to turn to page 3 of the Targum to find the story that would transform the teach-in into a major political issue in New Jersey and raise once again the question of the faculty’s academic freedom. After Susman’s heated verbal attack on Fitzpatrick, Professor Eugene Genovese, also of the History Department, “hushed the audience” by stating that “those of you who know me know that I am a Marxist and a Socialist. Therefore, unlike most of my distinguished colleagues here this morning, I do not fear or regret the impending Viet Cong victory in Vietnam. I welcome it.”25 The university had a slightly different version of the statement, but in either form, when the remarks appeared in the commercial press, a furious public debate began. Letters from both sides flooded the university, the newspapers, and the state legislature, either calling for the school to fire Genovese or in support of free speech and academic freedom. A legislative inquiry in June concluded that Genovese had not violated university regulations, but noted that those regulations imposed on faculty members special obligations to consider when speaking in public their role as citizens, members of a learned profession, representatives of the university, and, in particular, in the quasi-classroom-like setting of the teach-in (the same official obligation invoked in the Cold War cases). The report concluded with a recommendation that the university tighten its procedures and regulations. In July, the Republican candidate for governor, Wayne Dumont, went further. He met with Gross, pressed him to dismiss Genovese, and, when Gross refused on behalf of himself and the board, Dumont made the issue a cen-\n\n24 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nterpiece of his campaign. In August, the board responded to the legislature in a report to Governor Richard Hughes. The board noted that Genovese’s statement “evidenced a lack of good judgment,” but concluded that current university regulations were adequate and that Genovese had not violated them. Appended to the report was a statement from the History Department. The department made clear that Genovese was a gifted teacher and scholar, and was so judged by his professional colleagues at Rutgers and elsewhere, and it cautioned against allowing a “mood of hysteria” to repress faculty members who as a matter of conscience spoke out on a public issue.26 The November election, in which Hughes, who supported the university’s position, defeated Dumont, provides an index of how much things had changed from the time of the Cold War crisis during the previous decade. The first teach-in was followed by many others. Some were sponsored by SDS, some by other antiwar groups, and many were protested by YAF. In April 1966, on the first anniversary of the New Brunswick teach-in, Dumont and Genovese met for an anticlimactic debate. In a comprehensive poll done by the Targum in late 1967, 52 percent of the students polled opposed the war, 41 percent supported it, with the remainder undecided, and the strongest opposition to the war was on the Douglass campus. At the same time, the Targum estimated that no more than 5 percent of the students were actively engaged in pro- or antiwar efforts.27 In fall 1969, the Student Mobilization Committee—a national group— called for a moratorium on October 15 on college campuses across the country as a protest against the war. Gross wrote to the Rutgers community that “we at Rutgers should go beyond protest to a critical examination of basic issues facing the nation.” It would be a day, he hoped, to demonstrate the “role of the university as teacher, as guardian of civilized values, and as the critical and moral intelligence which compels the community to ponder its course of action.”28 Neither he nor the university cancelled classes or took a stand on the war. Nonetheless, most classes were cancelled, and elaborate and well-attended programs scheduled on all three campuses. Hosea Williams, from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, spoke at Newark; MIT professor Noam Chomsky, journalist and antiwar critic Seymour M. Hersh, and U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy all spoke at Rutgers College. On the smaller, quieter Camden campus, students showed two antiwar films, and the faculty held a teach-in. At Livingston, which had opened that fall, the student-faculty\n\nBecoming a State University • 25\n\nAcademic Assembly, in preparation for the moratorium, approved a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. Criticism poured in, but also praise. Gross handled the criticism politely but resolutely. He did nothing about the SDS protesters who marched on his home and symbolically nailed a set of demands to his door (“Martin Luther style”) calling for the abolition of ROTC (which had become the symbol of university complicity in the war effort) and better pay for food service workers. When, in December, SDS followed up by purposely disrupting a Board of Governors meeting and refusing to leave until its demands were met, the university had the protesters arrested, and the six Douglass students in the group faced suspension as well. Later that spring, however, after President Richard Nixon announced the expansion of the Vietnam War to Cambodia, the nation’s campuses erupted in protest. At Rutgers, a student strike began Friday, May 1. By Monday, strike committees were active on every campus. On May 4, the Targum ran an editorial, “Time to act—Strike now,” prepared and approved by its staff, as well as those of student newspapers at seven Ivy League schools, Sarah Lawrence, and Bryn Mawr, which called for an end to “a corrupt and immoral war.” That same day, Gross spoke to more than two thousand protesters on the lawn in front of Old Queens and expressed his sympathy for their cause. The next day, more than five thousand protesters demonstrated. By May 6, the faculties at each college had essentially ended “business as usual.” The Arts and Science faculty at Newark—in a resolution typical of what happened throughout Rutgers (but also on campuses from College Park, Maryland, to Berkeley, California)—voted to “reorient” the energy of the faculty and students to “intensive education” on U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia. They made final examinations optional, and allowed pass/fail course grading. Students and faculty pressured the Board of Governors to abolish ROTC; the state legislature pressured the board to maintain the program. The board sided with the legislature. Mason Gross, personally committed to many of the same goals as the protesters (if not always to their methods), did a masterly job of preserving as much calm as possible internally, while he and the Board of Governors defended the university’s commitment to free and unfettered speech. There is no question, however, that over his years at Rutgers, Gross had subtly shifted his position: from a spokesperson for the restrictive definition of academic freedom in the 1950s, to cautious and not unqualified\n\n26 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nsupport for the teach-ins, to his endorsement of the moratorium coupled with his symbolic appearance on the lawn of Old Queens in May 1970. He had moved to the left, although not as dramatically as the faculty and students—and that may well have been crucial to his success in piloting the university through this turbulent era of protest.29 During Gross’s tenure, black students also challenged the university. Their protests raised questions about Rutgers’s essential purposes and aspirations. The civil rights movement that swept the South in the 1950s and early 1960s inspired many faculty and students, and it led to a general awareness, evident in the first years of Gross’s presidency, that more had to be done at Rutgers to increase the enrollment of black students. Good intentions brought very slow progress. “In the fifteen years prior to 1967,” Richard P. McCormick noted, “only about two hundred blacks had received baccalaureate degrees, out of twenty-four thousand awarded. There were perhaps one hundred black undergraduates in 1965; by 1968 their number had grown to over four hundred, when they constituted about 3 percent of the undergraduate enrollment.”30 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., on April 4, 1968, led to a cancellation of classes at Rutgers, a convocation on racism on the New Brunswick campus, and additional efforts by the administration to fund minority programs and hire minority faculty. But it would fall to the black students themselves, on each of the campuses, to impart a “new urgency” to these efforts.31 One of those students was Karen Predow. She had grown up in Trenton; followed the college-preparatory track from seventh grade through graduation in 1966 from Trenton Central High School; and been recruited as part of a Rutgers initiative to bring more African American students from targeted high schools to the university. At Douglass, where she was one of two dozen African American first-year students, and a commuter from Trenton, she fit in slowly, more estranged and an object of curiosity among the white students than a target of hostility. Like many African American students at Rutgers in the mid-1960s, she received no financial aid, and her parents paid most of her college expenses; to make ends meet, she eventually completed her fall semester living in the household of family friends in Piscataway. Predow had not been a high school activist, although her parents were members of the NAACP, but she quickly became part of the first effort to organize black students in New Brunswick. That spring (1967), after Rutgers College black students formed the Student Afro-American Society (SAS), she and several other Douglass women accepted an invita-\n\nBecoming a State University • 27\n\ntion to join, established their own committee within the organization, and eventually charted an independent course for their committee.32 Another of the activists who would so dramatically challenge the university for its lack of commitment to the recruitment and retention of black students and faculty was Vickie Donaldson. Donaldson’s mother had moved to Newark from Florida to find work in nursing, but Vickie had stayed with her maternal grandmother as she completed her studies at the local (segregated) school system in Quincy, Florida (near Tallahassee). As a teenager, she had been president of the honor society, sung in the church choir, and joined the Congress of Racial Equality. She applied to both Rutgers–Newark and Douglass College, but decided on the Newark campus when Douglass could not guarantee her housing. That summer, 1967, she commuted across the city, at the time of the Newark civil disturbances, to attend Newark Preparatory School and meet her Rutgers foreign language admissions requirement. By autumn, Donaldson was engulfed in a campus where “all the buildings were white,” all the walls were white, and all her classmates were white, and the tinted windows shut off the campus from the city.33 On campus she met Richard Roper, also a southerner, who had matriculated a year earlier, joined the campus NAACP, and then helped found the Black Organization of Students (BOS). Roper convinced her to join. Donaldson had grown up in the South, Predow in New Jersey. Donaldson had taken part in the civil rights movement, Predow had not. Both had been good students in high school and met the demanding standards for admission to Rutgers; both largely paid for their own education; both joined black student organizations soon after arriving at Rutgers, and both read widely in black nationalist and Black Power literature. And in a movement whose most visible leaders were men, both were women. Both fought not only to bring black people and black culture into the center of the institution but also to transform Rutgers itself. Each campus had a black student movement. In spring 1968, personal contacts among members of these groups led to collective action. On each campus, a carefully drawn up set of demands was sent to the administration; the demands were arranged serially, each announced on a different day for maximum impact. Under pressure, the Board of Governors met with SAS representatives on April 11 (the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. a week earlier had produced a sense that something had to be done to improve conditions on campus), and the board then scheduled\n\n28 • Rutgers since 1945\n\na second meeting for a week later in the library in New Brunswick (these two meetings were the first the board had ever held with organized student groups). At that meeting, by prearrangement, individual black students read carefully prepared position statements on each of more than a dozen grievances and demands. When the university response proved to be, as the students saw it, too little, too late, BOS acted. On February 24, 1969, two dozen black students occupied Conklin Hall on the Newark campus and renamed it “Liberation Hall”—the first such protest in the university’s history. (Building takeovers were already a popular protest tactic among student demonstrators on other campuses and over the years would be used for various causes at Rutgers.) The students’ demands—which were echoed in protests on all the other campuses—included more hiring of black faculty and staff, improved efforts for admission and retention of black students, and development of a black studies program. Gross neither summoned the police to remove the students nor invoked the university policy on disruption but rather met with them, helped hammer out an agreement that would eventually bring the takeover to an end, and while the negotiations were in progress, went to Camden to meet with black students who were staging their own protest. Gross strongly supported the thrust of the students’ demands. He warned, however, that the crucial admissions question could only be solved by a statewide response involving all the colleges, and that such a solution required state funding. He also cautioned that curricular and admissions reforms had to come from the faculty. On each campus, in fact, hastily called faculty meetings worked out responses, all of which, however, fell short of the call for open admissions for black New Jersey high school graduates. As disruptive protest in Newark broke out again, the Board of Governors, President Gross, and Chancellor of Higher Education Ralph Dungan met in mid-March 1969 and crafted a “surprising solution” to the contentious admissions question. The board committed itself to establishing the Urban University Program (UUP). That program would admit “educationally and economically disadvantaged graduates of the secondary schools in those communities where Rutgers has its primary location,” first to remedial courses, if necessary, and then, as fully matriculated students.34 The program made its debut in September, but never received the full state support it needed, and was never effectively integrated with the individual college faculties who had the responsibility for educating these students. Ultimately, under state pressure, it gave way to an alternative program, the\n\nBecoming a State University • 29\n\nEqual Opportunity Fund, established in 1968 in the wake of the 1967 urban disruption in Newark. Yet out of the confusion of overlapping programs came substantial and sustained improvement in the admission of minority students to Rutgers. The university’s efforts to address what Gross, much of the faculty, and the board considered legitimate concerns of the black protesters met with skeptical, and more often, hostile responses beyond the university. Rutgers, critics said, had caved in to black demands, lowered its standards, and committed resources without state approval. Dungan, who as early as 1967 had urged the state to address the educational plight of minority students, nonetheless severely criticized the specific response of the university to the crisis. He singled out Rutgers’s dysfunctional system of committees, its failure to invoke its policy on student disruptions, and its attempts to run its Newark and Camden campuses from the distant halls of Old Queens. In early May, the state legislature followed up on widespread criticism of the university by asking Gross to answer twenty-one questions about the school’s response to the disruptions, the new admissions policy, the distribution of funding among the campuses, and the governance of the university. The first, and most pressing, question was how the university would handle another such incident. Gross stated that “the administration had made it quite clear to all members of the university community that disruption in any form, whether it be occupation of a building, blocking of a building, or the invasion of classes or offices is a violation of University regulations,” but went on to argue that specific responses depended on the circumstances, and that calling in the police “inevitably leads to violence and greatly intensifies the gravity of the situation.” He explained that the new admissions policy was experimental and envisioned as part of a statewide effort that could succeed only if other colleges, including twoyear schools, also increased admissions of and programs for disadvantaged students. Gross challenged Dungan’s harsher criticisms of the university, concluding that “Mr. Dungan . . . seems to have assumed that some rather trivial deficiencies gave a true picture of the whole.”35 Later in May, Frank McGee of NBC broadcast a news report that featured a discussion with Gross on the university’s response to the Conklin Hall takeover. McGee asked Gross if the new programs for “impoverished high school graduates” in Newark, Camden, and New Brunswick had not been “conceived in fear” and “extorted by . . . unspoken threats,” to which Gross responded that the university had already been pursuing\n\n30 • Rutgers since 1945\n\nan aggressive recruitment program for minority students, which the black student protesters had felt was not aggressive enough. They were, he concluded, probably right. When McGee followed up by asking Gross how he would “characterize the charge that you were blackmailed,” Gross answered bluntly, “I would ignore it.”36 That summer, Gross and numerous other university officials were called to testify in Trenton about the handling of the takeover of Conklin Hall, the protests at Douglass, Rutgers, and Camden, and the new Urban University Program. The hearings did not solve the problem of funding new admissions and curricular initiatives, or preclude further protest on campus, but they did curb the political fallout occasioned by the bold actions of minority students frustrated by the slow process of change at their state university. Gross’s concern about “disadvantaged students” carried over into athletics. Gross himself had been a college athlete, rowing while at Cambridge, and at Rutgers he enthusiastically attended football games and supported the crew program. He saw athletics as integral to the mission of a public university and envisioned a participatory sports program quite different from the elite sports culture he had known in England. In the late 1960s, when the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) imposed a minimum scholastic grade-point average requirement for the recruitment and support of a student athlete, Gross led an unsuccessful effort to create a more flexible rule. He worried that the standard would keep disadvantaged students (which meant, at that time, the few black athletes who played on the Rutgers football team) from attending college, and argued that Rutgers was the best judge of whether anyone who applied for admission could meet its rigorous academic standards—a position taken as well by many of the Ivy League schools. Gross lost the fight with the NCAA, but more generally, he helped define the uneasy partnership between athletics and academics that would shape campus life under the next administration. In May 1970, Gross announced his retirement, effective September 1971. Like the president before him, and most of the presidents who followed, his frustrations in negotiating with the state for support and autonomy probably influenced his decision, as undoubtedly did his health. Internally, in the final years of his administration, there had been important changes: a Rutgers College faculty committee, chaired by historian Warren Susman, had recommended sweeping reforms of the college’s general education requirement, and after impassioned debate, the faculty had adopted a new\n\nBecoming a State University • 31\n\nset of requirements giving students far more responsibility for selecting their own courses; the University Senate, which advised the president and the Board of Governors on university policy, added students (with voting rights) to the membership of faculty and administrators; and the American Association of University Professors became the collective bargaining unit for the Rutgers faculty. Each of these changes shaped the university’s future, but for the moment they were only footnotes to the central narrative of Gross’s presidency. That narrative centered on two themes: first, the sympathetic if not always harmonious relationship of the state to the state university, which allowed for the massive building projects of the 1960s and early 1970s and the tremendous increase in enrollments; and, second, Gross’s (and the board’s) leadership in addressing the issues raised by a decade of student protest. Yet no one event or policy can capture the energy and excitement of Gross’s presidency in the late 1960s. His legacy was to have guided Rutgers through tumultuous times while retaining the respect and affection of so many. “What will Rutgers be when its gadfly goes?” asked the Newsletter, for “from the start, Gross was . . . tall, handsome, gracious, potentially dominating.”37\n\n2\n\nRutgers Becomes a Research University\n\n• The Presidency of Edward J. Bloustein\n\nThe almost two decade span from the presidency of Richard Nixon to that of Ronald Reagan reoriented American politics toward conservative social policies, market-driven solutions to economic problems, and fiscal belt-tightening at every level of government. Watergate, Iran-Contra, and innumerable lesser scandals aroused the electorate’s skepticism of public officials and injected a new nastiness into the already rough-and-tumble political order. In this climate, making the case for public recognition of and support for higher education became more difficult. The 1970s and 1980s were troubled times, and the golden age for American colleges and universities was definitely over. During the seventies and eighties, five crucial developments shaped the higher education landscape. First, the enormous growth of federal support for university-based scientific research leveled off; under political pressure from states that had received little aid in the past, Congress increasingly insisted that the aid be distributed more equitably among the nation’s universities and that aid go to applied research to produce publicly useful results rather than to support basic or disinterested research. Second, even as the federal government slowed the dispersal of research dollars, Congress began to allot more money in direct student aid. Soon after the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the federal government provided direct student aid under the National Defense Education Act (1958). That money targeted future high school teachers and, increasingly, graduate 32\n\nRutgers Becomes a Research University • 33\n\nstudents. More dramatically, a 1972 amendment, sponsored by Rhode Island senator Claiborne Pell, to the 1964 Higher Education Act began a program of direct federal grants to college students who demonstrated need. Through the Pell Grants program, the federal government allocated billions of dollars to assist millions of students. The Guaranteed Student Loan Act of 1978 extended this commitment, but with more ambiguous consequences. Both programs provided “portable aid,” given to the student rather than the institution she or he attended, so schools became part of a consumer economy, competing for students (th"
