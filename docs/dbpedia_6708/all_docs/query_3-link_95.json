With more than a decade of experience, he covers Apple and Google and writes on iPhone and Android features, privacy and security settings and more.\n\nDavid Priest Former editor\n\nDavid Priest is an award-winning writer and editor who formerly covered home security for CNET.\n\nNelson Aguilar ,\n\nDavid Priest\n\n18 min read\n\nAlexa, Amazon's digital voice assistant, is capable of many things, like playing your favorite Christmas song on Spotify or getting you the weather forecast for New Year's Eve -- but that's just the start. You can also use your voice to control the Fire TV devices around your home or even create intricate automated routines. You can definitely go crazy.\n\nWhatever it is you want to do, you can probably do it, but first you need to know what to say. If you own an Echo device and want to master Alexa, these are all the voice commands you should know.\n\nNewest Amazon Alexa commands\n\nAt its annual fall event this past year, Amazon not only announced new hardware products but also talked up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including:\n\nThe \"Hey, Disney\" command, which allows you to get information and play around with some of Disney's most beloved characters, will unlock features with Disney's Magic Band Plus to play game-show style trivia games and more.\n\nWith the new premium $35 Alexa Voice Remote Pro, you can say \"Alexa, find my remote\" into any Echo device you own (or the dedicated Remote Finder button in the Fire TV app) to play a sound from your remote, making it easier to find when it's lost.\n\nThe third-generation Fire TV Cube also has a few new Alexa commands, like \"Alexa, watch ESPN on cable\" so that you don't have to manually change inputs on your TV, and if you have a compatible webcam that you can connect into the Fire TV Cube, you can say something like \"Alexa, call dad\" to video call friends and family on your TV.\n\nAmazon also announced the second-generation Amazon Echo Auto, which drivers can use to play music, make calls and even talk with an agent to request help by saying, \"Hey Alexa, call roadside assistance.\"\n\nIf you're into shopping, you can say something like \"Alexa, show me the green pleated skirt\" to find specific clothing items using the Shop the Look feature, which you can also use for home and beauty products.\n\nUsing Amazon to make purchases from Whole Foods for curbside pickup? You can say \"Alexa, check into Whole Foods\" to let the grocery store know you're there.\n\nAnd if you want to turn on a light or some other smart home device, you can now schedule it. For example, you can say \"Hey Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights in 5 minutes.\"\n\nSummoning Alexa\n\nBy default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, \"Alexa.\" You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually).\n\nIf you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa.\n\nThere's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, \"Stop.\"\n\nAmazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, \"Alexa, play folk music at volume six,\" or, \"Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list.\"\n\nOther places you can access Alexa\n\nWhile the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant.\n\nIn fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have:\n\nThe Alexa app on iOS and Android\n\nThe Amazon Shopping app\n\nThe Amazon Music app\n\nCortana on a Windows computer\n\nYou can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. \"Hey, Siri\" or \"Hey, Google\" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant.\n\nOn an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, \"Open Alexa.\" After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana.\n\nAlexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example).\n\nThe complete list of Alexa commands\n\nThe list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted.\n\nWhen you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com.\n\nHere are all the native Alexa commands.\n\nBasic Alexa commands\n\nAsk for help: \"Alexa, help.\"\n\nMute or unmute: \"Alexa, mute\" or, \"Alexa, unmute.\"\n\nStop or pause: \"Alexa, stop\" or, \"Alexa, shut up.\"\n\nChange volume: \"Alexa, set the volume to 5,\" \"Alexa, louder\" or, \"Alexa, turn up/down the volume.\"\n\nAlexa commands for Echo Show\n\nThe Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays.
