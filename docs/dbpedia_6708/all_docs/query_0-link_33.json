The agreement provides for pay rises from six shillings to 14 shil- lings (84 cents to $1.96) a week for projectionists, usherettes and cashiers. Cinema workers had their last raises of from six shillings to £1 (84 cents to $2.80) a week in December, 1955. Many exhibitors have complained that the new agreement will take up much of their recent tax relief. They point to the latest Board of Trade statistics which estimate that wages and salaries account for nearly 42 per cent of the exhibitors' share of takings.

Aldington, O.B.E., and Consul B. H. Wilcox. Orderly Film Release Urged ( Continued day and night\"— and his plane flight home, the Allied leader declared that a steady flow of product would gen- erate enough momentum to carry theatres and distribution through the slow spots and keep the public com- ing to the box office. Decries 'False Economy' Marcus linked this problem with that of print availability which he blamed on \"false economy\" on the part of distributors, asserting that the result of both conditions is \"a starva- tion diet which is letting the thea- tres die of malnutrition.\" In spite of the severe slump in April and May, the Wisconsin pres- ident predicted a tremendous in- crease in attendance this summer and on the long term outlook de- clared that even though changing conditions may force even more thea- tres to close enough will remain to make the industry the leader in the entertainment field and \"the biggest box office of all— and that includes television either pay or free.\" Will Remodel Four Theatres He's backing this confidence with dollars, too. This year he has con- tracted to spend $250,000 to re- model four theatres in his circuit, in Green Bay, Appleton, Neenah and Wauwatosa and, although he has been forced to make economy cuts he declared he will increase his ad- vertising budget for all of his thea- tres. \"The public,\" he said, \"is shop- ping for pictures today. They are more selective than ever. But I do not believe there will ever come a time when they are going to confine their entertainment to their living rooms. We are a gregarious people. We are going to want to go out for our entertainment.\" Pleads for More Prints The cutback on prints became critical about a year ago, Marcus said, and is now proving a positive detriment to business. \"What good does it do a merchandiser,\" he point- ed out, \"to spend huge amounts ad- vertising and promoting a product, preparing the public to look for it, and then not have it available when they want it?\" The cost of the few extra prints needed, he said, is min- ute compared to the loss in per- manent patronage which results. In many cases, he pointed out, the sav- ing is eaten up anyway in the cost to the distributor of phone calls and shipping involved in \"borrowing\" prints from one exchange area to serve another. For the smaller pictures which do not involve a major budget for na- tional advertising Marcus advocated from page 1 ) the territorial or regional release plan in order to save print costs. The multiple run plan, being used more and more in the large metro- politan areas he praised as a new merchandising method which is the kind of plan needed to adapt the in- dustry to changing conditions. The public is being trained, he pointed out, to do their shopping locally, avoiding the big downtown areas. In addition to a better and more even flow of product, Marcus as- serted, new faces must be developed. \"The audience today has changed,\" he said. \"We have lost the older people. The people who come to our theatres are the teen-agers and the young married couples. We must make pictures for them and we must develop new stars for them.\" Sees 'Evaluation' as Vital In this, he declared, exhibitors must help distributors and producers by not demanding old established names and by not setting these names as the standard by which pictures are judged. \"We must evaluate them,\" he declared, \"on the basis of their entertainment value to this new audience.\" Minimum Wage Board To Meet Here Today Nine members of a New York mini- mum wage board to review standards in the amusement and recreation in- dustry will be sworn in this morning by Isador Lubin, industrial commis- sioner, at 11 A.M. at 80 Centre St. The new board will hold its first meet- ing immediately afterward. Emanuel Frisch, board chairman of the Metropolitan Motion Picture The- atres Association, Inc., is the indus- try's representative on the board, which has three members each from the public, management and labor. The wage board will conduct a study of wages in the industry, hold public hearings to gather additional opinions and information and recommend to the industrial commissioner any re- visions in the existing wage order deemed necessary and desirable. The current minimum wage stand- ard for the amusement industry, es- tablished in April, 1951, sets an hour- ly minimum of 75 cents for workers with some variations based on size of community or specific occupations.

Baffle Hell Wilcox-Neagle — DC A A motion picture not apt to endear the British peoples to the Chinese Reds, but one which may tell American audiences something of what happened in Asia through involved Oriental and Occidental relations. It is the story of H.M.S. Amethyst, engaged in a peaceful mission, carry- ing supplies up the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, to Nanking, in the spring of 1949. With diplomatic clearance, and no warlike intention, she steamed past the guns of the self-styled \"People's Liberation Army\" in the height of China's civil war, and was attacked without warning. A small vessel, in river traffic, she had no opportunity to defend her- self. Blasted again and again, at point-blank range, the Amethyst went out of control and ran aground, with many of her crew dead and wounded. Help arrived, as a result of her desperate radio messages, in the person of a young naval attache, Richard Todd— remembered for his role in \"A Man Called Peter\"— who raced overland to take command of the stricken ship, pinned down helplessly by the Reds. He deals directlv with the local Communist boss, a crafty war lord named Colonel Peng (Akim Tamiroff) who wants only confession from the British for their \"offense\" in the attack— a rank fabrication which the British crew will not admit. The delivery of the ship, the flight down river to rejoin their fleet, the courage of the crew and their commanders make a brilliant revelation of bravery, and also the apparent duplicity of their Chinese captors. Obviouslv, this wasn't made on the Yangtse River, as we remember it in the \"National Geographic\"— but it is convincing and thoroughly entertaining documentary history. There are three and a half pages of cast and credits, as compared with two pages of synopsis, furnished for this screening— so we can tell you that it has been well produced with British skills, and with every man at his place of dutv. All of the cast are excellent, as is the direction by Michael Anderson, for the Herbert Wilcox production. Outside of Todd and Tamiroff, there are few whose names are known in this market, but the performances turned in will be a credit to our screens, in whatever or wherever local situations may be engaged. It isn't an \"art\" picture— nor is it just another war picture, for this is high adventure, against a seamy page of history which is still aligned against us in current affairs.

WILL BE SEEN AGAIN FEATURE REVIEWS The Giant Claw Columbia Hollywood, June 30 Science-fiction enthusiasts are given a double workout by this Sam Katz- man production directed by Fred F. Sears and played out proficiently by Jeff Morrow, Mara Corday, Morris Ankrum, Edgar Barrier and other de- pendable performers. The picture gives followers of this type of melo- drama their first enjoyable workout in granting the possibility that a bird big enough to gobble down airplanes and railroad trains without showing up on radar screens or succumbing to rocket and cannon attack might exist, and their second in accepting the scientific apparatus employed in bringing the bird to a watery grave at picture's end. Producer, director and players work together well. Unlike most stories hinging on the activities of abnormal creatures, this one brings the monstrous bird into audience view immediately and re- veals it repeatedly, at long range and close up, thereafter. The script by Samuel Newman and Paul Gangelin opens with Morrow, an electronics engineer in Air Force employ, pilot- ing a plane solo in a test flight with Miss Corday and Officer Ankrum re- cording his readings via radio. Sud- denly a huge shape flies over his plane and he reports it at once as a UFO (unidentified flying object). Radar does not pick it up, how- ever, so he is disbelieved on landing and accused of perpetrating a prank. Steadily thereafter his report is dupli- cated by others received from various planes, still without radar corrobora- tion, and finally, after the flying mon- ster has devoured several planes and people in flight, the nations of the ter- rorized world pool their most power- ful weapons to slay it. But bullets and bombs bounce off of its impreg- nable body. The means by which Morrow succeeds in dealing death to the creature is as surprising as the existence of the bird itself. Ralph Hammeras and George Teague creat- ed the technical effects, some of the best ever devised. Running time, 73 minutes. General classification. Release, in June. William R. Weaver Trooper Hook Fielding— UA Hollywood, June 30 Joel McCrea and Barbara Stan- wyck have grown-up story material to work with in this Sol Baer Field- ing Production and they give it their experienced and excellent best, with Earl Holliman, Edward Andrews, John Dehner, Rudolfo Acosta and others in a large cast measuring up stoutly to their standard. Under steady direction of Charles Marquis Warren they give the story by Jack Schaefer and screenplay by Martin Berkley, David Victor and Herbert Little, Jr., the impact of powerful performances consistently maintained. The picture, adult in the correct sense of the word, is likely to play to rising grosses. The story opens on an Indian massacre of a small detachment of U.S. Cavalry, promptly followed by arrival of a larger force which cap- tures the Apache war party under Chief Nanchez. McCrea plays Trooper Hook, whose orders are to take Nanchez prisoner and bring him in, and Miss Stanwyck plays Nanchez's white wife, Cora, and mother of his small son, Quito, played by Terry Lawrence. Although McCrea's men resent his kindness to Cora, who turns out to have been captured by Nanchez on her way from the East to join her rancher husband, Dehner, and forced to marry him, he sets out to take her and the boy to Dehner's home near Tucson. First, however, he de- livers Nanchez to his superiors at a fort from which the prisoner shortly escapes to rejoin his braves and ambush the stage coach in which his son, wife and McCrea are riding. For much of the running time the picture centers around the journey of the stagecoach through magnificently photographed terrain under menace of Apaches bent on getting posses- sion of the Indian boy. But it is not until McCrea has delivered Cora and Quito to Dehner, who is willing to accept Cora but not the boy, that the story rises to its climax and rushes to a dramatic conclusion. Running time, 81 minutes. Adult classification. Release, in June. W. R. W. Documentary ( Continued from page 1 ) distribution. Two of the films, eacl running about three and one-hal .minutes, were specially made for in sertion in newsreels, while the thin was a special clip made for showin on the Break the Bank TV show. The company has set a budget o $250,000 for preparation and distribu tion of these films. They were edite from over 40,000 feet of film shot o location by a special unit and camera man and tell the story of the makin of the picture under what both Hoi den and Spiegel agreed were \"primi tive conditions.\" The program include 10 three-and-one-half minute new features, plus two featurettes, on running 30 minutes and the other I minutes. The latter, said Spiegel, ar now being edited by the film's direc tor, David Lean, in London. Expects Maximum Coverage As a result of these short documen taries, Lazarus said, \"The Bridge Ove the River Kwai\" should obtain \"th most comprehensive coverage any filn has ever received\" in a pre-sellin campaign.

In an attempt to answer the im- portant question, \"What do the peo- ple of the world really think of the U. S ?\" NBC News has sent a re- porter-cameraman team to 10 cities of major importance in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. Joe Michaels, NBC-TV \"Today\" reporter, and cameraman Simon Avnet went abroad to record on sound and film the views, reactions and sentiments of the average Mr. and Mrs. Citizen of London, Paris, Frankfort, Belgrade, Cairo, Istanbul, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Taipei and Tokyo, which appears to be a reasonable and well-selected cross-section of the world on the other side of the oceans. William R. McAndrew, director of NBC News, sums it up neatly: \"The views of the chiefs of state are well known through official pronounce- ments. It is the opinions of the masses that haven't been heard.\" NBC-TV's Today is presenting two of these fea- tures weekly, commencing this week, and the NBC Radio Network like- wise is featuring the material from abroad. In August, a special half-hour digest of the interviews thus far pre- sented will be offered. This is the kind of venturesome en- terprise which goes so far in attain- ing and maintaining the preeminent place of television in the minds and thoughts of the public. This is public service value of unusual quality, which is most important. Speaking of public service, it is interesting to noto that NBC reports a sum total in excess of 3,600 one- minute announcements on behalf of more than 100 different public serv- ice projects were broadcast by the National Broadcasting Company, on TV and radio, during 1956. Together, the company says, these announce- ments created some 12,000,000 view- er and listener impressions, which would have cost $9,000,000 if they were paid for at regular rates. These figures, it is pointed out, do not in- clude special programs. It is a happy record, doubtless to be measured similarly by the other networks, and one of which the whole industry may well be proud. — Charles S. Aaronson Telemeter ( Continued from page 1 ) of the Oceanside area for pay-televi- sion, and Tele-movie counsel Harris W. Hertzberg said today, \"Opera- tions are scheduled to begin as soon as the franchise is granted by the council, which is expected in the near future.\" The Oceanside population is 25,- 000 and contains about 5,000 dwell- ings. It is located on the coast 30 miles north of San Diego on the principal coastal highway. Looks Beyond Oceanside Tele-Movie Corp. plans to expand its pay-television coverage ultimately to include near-by communities, Carlsbad and Vista, which would in- crease the system to 9,000 homes. Installations in 10 other Southern California cities also are under con- sideration by Tele-Movie. Among owners of Tele-Movie Corp. are Walter J. Dennis, Chicago and California capitalist; Wade Al- len, exhibitor operating theatres in San Diego, Detroit and Phoenix; J. E. Poynter, president of Film Book- ing Service of California, and attor- ney Hertzberg. Industry Forums Are Planned by Academy The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has announced plans for eight forums on television subjects to be presented for members and guests from September through May during the 1957-1958 season. Producers and presenters of the forums, under the auspices of the Academy, will be the three television networks and the New York Television Film Industry. Each of the three networks and the film industry will present two forums at a place of their choosing and on dates to be announced. ABC will cover research and promotion, the CBS forums will deal with dramatic programs and news and public af- fairs, NBC will handle special pro- grams and publicity and public rela- tions, and the film industry will dis- cuss pilot films and television film economics. Three New Sponsors For 4 NBC Series Night-time programming sales for the 1957-58 television season contin- ued to climb at NBC-TV, as three advertisers ordered sponsorships for four new series, it was announced at the weekend by William (Billy) Goodheart, Jr., vice-president, televi- sion network sales, for the National Broadcasting Co. Goodheart said the new orders, all for 52-week periods, include those for Hazel Bishop, Inc., the American To- bacco Co. and Lever Bros. ( Continued mously ordered by the committee, the report was not officially approved. Copies were sent to the Department of Justice and the Federal Communi- cations Commission \"for comment and appropriate action, if necessary,\" committee chairman Magnuson (D., Wash.) declared. Formal approval of the report's recommendations will be held off until Justice and the FCC replied, Magnuson said, at which time the committee will issue its own re- port, with recommendations on pos- sible legislation or further action by Justice or the commission. Cites Network Probe The report declared that it would be wise for the committee not to rec- ommend specific legislation now for several reasons. It pointed to the FCC's Network Study Committee, which has been making a thorough investigation of network practices and is scheduled to complete its report Sept. 30; to the investigations in the television industry currently being conducted by Justice; to the hearings held by the Anti-trust Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. Nevertheless, the report reaches cer- tain conclusions and makes certain specific recommendations. It found that the networks' option time practice operates \"to transfer program control to the networks,\" in some cases blanketing the best view- ing hours. This often results, the report said, in the exclusion of inde- pendent producers and new syndicat- ed films for television and the bar- ring of local advertisers, public serv- ice programs and other local pro- grams. The report also found that the must-buy practice precludes the purchase of television time by many regional and local advertisers. Sees Both Sides of Coin In addition, the report declared that the present extent of the networks' ownership of television stations \"might raise questions as to undue concentration of control,\" even though there are \"sound reasons\" for permit- ting the networks to own and operate television stations. As possible remedies, the report suggested that the FCC revise or ad- just option time practices, \"so as to open up part of the best viewing hours for local public service pro- gramming and for programs from other sources other than a station's primary network\"; that a minimum dollar purchase offer to advertisers should be substituted for the present must-buy arrangement; that the FCC should not permit increased concen- tration of stations by networks or other multiple owners until it has con- sidered the Network Study Commit- tee's report. Wants Longer Affiliation-Term The report also recommended that copies of affiliation agreements filed with the FCC be open for inspection, to insure equal terms; and that the possible maximum term of affiliation from page 1 ) be lengthened to five years in order \"to give greater stability to broadcast operations.\" The report declared that none of its suggestions \"would seriously impaii the ability of the networks to com- pete, and it is confidently expected that they will continue to thrive and serve the public.\" On the other hand, the 'report con- tinued, \"It seems entirely possible that if steps such as are suggested herein are not taken, the networks may attain such a position of over- whelming importance that the public interest will require the imposition of detailed and rigid governmental regu- lation. If that can be avoided, both the public and the networks will benefit.\" Webs' Service Praised Highly The report maintained that there Was \"no desire to undermine the net- works, or to hamper them unreason- ably in their continuing efforts to ex- pand the horizons of television.\" The major part of the credit \"for the de- velopment of our television system' must go to the networks, the report said. \"To a large extent it was they who developed the programs which persuaded the public to buy sets by the millions,\" it declared, \"and, hav- ing developed such acceptance, were able to build advertising support for our present television system.\" Allied EDC ( Continued from page 1 ) those attending were Irving Dolling er, chairman of the committee, Ben Marcus, Wilbur Snaper, Abram F Myers and Jack Kirsch. The committee was also said to have discussed Allied's rapproche ment with COMPO and progress the industry has made with arbitration and conciliation. In addition, the group took up the reactivization of EDC units on a local level and further discussed plans for the 1957 convention of national Allied at the Concord Hotel at Lake Kiamesha N. Y. to be held in late October. Another for Cummings HOLLYWOOD, June 30 - Jack Cummings Productions, which will film \"Paint Your Wagon\" in associa- tion with L. B.

JERAULD Prospects for adoption of an arbitration system this year can seem dark or bright, depending upon who does the talking. The pessimists outnumber the optimists among those who have been induced to comment thus far. An overall plan could be approved by the negotiators before autumn, it is agreed, but how to finance the system might start an argument that could run for months. The overhead for the system might reach $250,000 per year. The fees which will be charged for filing com- plaints and providing copies of rec- ords wouldn't mean anything in the face of a budget of that kind. Rapid agreement was reached on a conciliation plan. The next meeting for discussion of the main arbitration system is scheduled for July 15.

How KRON Televised Hearings of House Un-American Activities Unit Special to THE DAILY SAN FRANCISCO, July 1— Recent televising here of the four-day hearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which drew a stern rebuke from Speaker Sam Rayburn to Committee Chairman Francis E. Walter, has just brought to light the au- dacious, but simple manner in which KRON-TV moved its cameras into the hearing room. KRON aired live every moment of all the sessions. The morning periods went out over its own transmitter on Channel 4. Because of scheduled reg- ular NBC network commitments, KRON piped the afternoon sessions to KQED, the community-sponsored educational station so that the after- noon sessions were viewed live on Channel 9. On the first day when a camera- shy witness, called for quizzing on Communist infiltration into profession- al groups such as lawyers, teachers, newspaper reporters, etc., objected to being televised, KRON obligingly (Continued on page 4) Worldwide Buena Vista Will Distribute 2 for Whitney $5,000,000 Deal Closed; One Film Near Completion From THE DAILY Bureau HOLLYWOOD July l.-Disney's Buena Vista organization will distrib- ute C.

'Love' Reprint Out Allied Artists has a national tieup with the New American Film Library on \"Love in the Afternoon.\" The publishing house has made a first printing of the story, originally pub- lished as \"Ariane,\" under its film title with a scene from the picture on the cover. The first printing is 500,000 and a second printing is underway. By ONLOOKER TOM O'NEIL says there just isn't any basis whatever for those reports (some of which found their way into print) that while on his recent trip to Europe he had discussed a deal by which J. Arthur Rank would acquire the RKO Radio foreign distribution organization and maybe even the RKO Hollywood studio to turn out product for the new Rank Film Distributors of America. They were plucked out of the thin air that fills imaginative but idle minds, he suggested. . . . Speaking of the Rank F.D.A., the Kenneth Hargreaves organization is well organized and functioning smooth- ly now. While its initial billings are modest — reportedly a little under $30,000 weekly — they already are proving adequate to meet expenses, which is a healthy condition and makes the future nice to anticipate. Contributing importantly to keeping the overhead within reasonable bounds is the company's plan of territorial re- leases, using only the number of prints of each release required to service a single territory. When played off, those prints are moved along to another territory and are replaced by prints of a picture that has been playing somewhere else. . . . The Rank American organization has some fine manpower. It was fortunate in the tim- ing of its American beginning. When it was time to take on man- power it found a highly capable and experienced reservoir of former RKO Radio and to some extent, Republic, sales and office help available. That not only simplified the organizing work but gave R.F.D.A. a head start with some of the best manpower in American film distribution. Had it been otherwise, building of the organiza- tion would have taken much longer and choice would have been pretty well limited to \"floaters.\" Whether it's the product situation or the manpower, or more likely a combination of both, definite progress is being made by the new company, even in insular areas of the South and Midwest where a British picture has been regarded as just as much a foreign film as one from Germany. \"JET PILOT,\" the Howard Hughes' epic, is being screened for Uni- versal sales people, who will start selling it this summer for Sep- tember playdates. The word from those who've seen it is all good. They can't understand what prompted Hughes to keep it on the shelf for nearly 10 years, but they say time hasn't hurt it in any important respect and that it should make a buck at the boxoffices. . . . One opinion is that the picture shows Janet Leigh at the peak of her career and in an exceptionally attractive form. (Even the jets whistle at her as she prepares for bed at the air base.) Duke Wayne, 10 years younger, makes quite a hunk of man, and both principals give fine performances. . . . They do say, though, that the dialogue on the subject of Russia is pretty searing, so much so that the not too important markets under Soviet influence probably will be afraid to play it. . . . Keep your eye on the July 9 meeting of the Board of Estimate. . . . You have to hand it to Sam Pinanski. He believes so implicitly in the necessity of making it easy for today's patrons to see movies, as modern department store merchandising makes it easy for them to shop in suburban branches, that he's gradually convincing distributors that outlying theatres in growth areas should get important pictures the same time they play down- town first runs. . . . More and more are being opened that way all the time. ERIC JOHNSTON may be ready in two weeks with the announce- ment of his first appointments of exhibitor and independent pro- ducer representatives to the Production Code appeal board. . . . Business on \"Island in the Sun\" continues strong everywhere. Why shouldn't it with that advertising-promotion campaign of Charlie Einfeld's and his staff drawing maximum attention to it? MPEA Board to Hear Maas Report Today At today's meeting of the Motion Picture Export Association the board will hear a report by Irving Maas on Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, India and Burma.

New Campaign to Air House Group Hearings Special to THE DAILY WASHINGTON, July l.-Members of the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters are steaming up pressure to get permis- sion from Speaker Sam Rayburn for radio and television coverage of House committee hearings. Rayburn declared in 1952 and 1955 that he will continue his opposition until the House votes a change in its rules. The disagreement was brought into focus recently by the telecasting of a hear- ing outside of Washington. Harold E. Fellows, NARTB presi- dent, and Robert D. Swezey, of New Orleans, chairman of the NARTB Freedom of Information Committee, have been communicating with the 2,000 members of the organization and stating that this is \"an excellent opportunity for the radio and televi- sion industries to reiterate their posi- tion\" against Rayburn's refusal to let down the bars. Broadcasters have been asked to contact their local congressmen. Fel- lows and Swezey have also wired the president of 48 state broadcasters as- sociations asking them to join in the effort. SPECIAL TRAILERS FILMACK NUF SED 1327 S. Wabash .Chicago • 63G Ninth Ave. New York ( Continued from page 1 ) kept its cameras carefully pointed away from the witness and merely videoed audience, Congressmen of the committee and the committee's counsel asking the questions. In all, only three of the 30 subpoenaed wit- nesses interrogated during the four days objected to being televised. But every word spoken by everybody went on the air. Within hours after the first wit- ness protested against TV, Speaker Rayburn said in Washington that Chairman Walter was violating rules of the House of Representatives and ordered televising halted. But Walter ignored the ukase, and in reply the next day to a protesting witness who quoted Rayburn's publicized order, the Congressional chairman stated: 'Guests' of the City, He Says \"We (the committee) are guests here in San Francisco of City Hall. Make your complaint to whoever is in charge of this building. We have no more jurisdiction over TV cameras than we have in excluding newspaper reporters and photographers.\" Chairman Walter's words were sweet music to the ears of KRON officials who, after Rayburn's widely publicized criticism from Washington, were fearing momentarily to be evicted from the hearing. A spokes- man for KRON yesterday told Motion Picture Daily how the sta- tion went about its coverage. \"At the opening session,\" the spokesman said, \"we merely showed up with our camera crew just like the reporters and the still and newsreel photographers. It was as simple as that. Nobody challenged our right to be there until that first witness popped off. From there on out, how- ever, we sweated out every minute of the sessions.\" Viewer-Interest Evident Subsequent rating surveys revealed that every popular program on all other stations in the San Francisco area suffered varying degrees of view- er loss during the hours the hearings alternately were being televised by KRON and KQED. Even KRON fea- tures were hurt throughout the after- noon sessions when the station was feeding the proceedings to KQED. Back in Washington last week-end, Rayburn had a showdown with Chair- man Walter and the Speaker later reported to the press: \"He (Walter) is not going to tele- vise anything else, sub-committee or full committee, anywhere.\" New Playhouse Set Summer Playhouse, a weekly series of filmed dramas will start on NBC- TV tomorrow (9:30-10 P.M., EDT).

Levine's \"Walk Into Hell,\" which will have its premiere in 140 theatres in the New England territory on July 31. Besides TV and radio programs, along with newspapers and 24-sheet billboards, advertising by air will play an im- portant part in the plans. For one full week before the open- ing, a plane with a huge banner an- nouncing the playdates will fly over the New England territory, concen- trating on beaches, parks, play- grounds, ball games, etc. The pilot will use a different sector each day for complete coverage of the key cities. J. Shrader, Charlotte, Sells Poster Exchange Special to THE DAILY CHARLOTTE, July l.-Sale of the Charlotte Poster Exchange to F. E. Dyer, former manager of the Allied Artists exchange here, and Carl and Frank Lowry was announced here to- day by Shrader. No sale price was announced in the transaction. Shrader operated the United Artists exchange for a number of years before opening the poster business, which handles advertising material for thea- tres. He has not announced his future plans but for the present will continue operation of the Visulite Theatre with his son Robert. Pre -Selling tt JEANNE EAGELS\" will be ad •J vertised in consecutive issues of both \"Life\" and \"Look,\" which we believe is a step in the right direction since frequency of ads for a film in the national magazines is certain to attract more patrons to see a picture when it plays in local cities or towns. Half-page color ads for \"Jeanne Eagels\" will appear in the July 22 and the August 5 issues of \"Life\" and in the August 6 and 20 issue of \"Look.\" A full page ad will also appear in the September issue of \"Seventeen.\" In addition page ads will be in the September and August issues of 11 fan maga- zines. • \"Hardly had 'Gunfight at the OK Corral' Hal Wallis' movie of how Wyatt Earp and his gambler pal Doc Holliday wiped out the cattle-rustl- ing Clanton gang, opened when it swept into first place in the national box-office ratings and was well on its way to making a great deal of money,\" reports \"Life\" in the June 24 issue. \"And no wonder! This west- ern movie has everything.\" • \"A Hatful of Rain,\" and \"Ber- nardine,\" have been selected by \"Redbook\" as two top pictures for July. • Kirk Douglas in his article titled \"I was Always Hungry\" appearing in the June 29 issue of \"The Sat- urday Evening Post\" tells about a Warner executive visiting him in a New York hotel. He told Kirk that it was easier to see him in person than to see his picture \"Lust for Life\" at the Plaza Theatre, that could be seen from the hotel window. The Warner man said \"I've been trying to see that picture for a month but there is always a line at the Plaza and I'm too busy to stand in it.\" • \"If you've ever liked any musical comedy, you can't help liking 'The Pajama Game' \" says Ruth Harbert in the July issue of \"Good Housekeep- ing.\" \"Warner Bros has done a truly praiseworthy job in taking all that was best in the Broadway production. If you are in the mood for 101 min- utes of fast-breaking musical fun, see this picture right away. It has 'hit' written all over it.\" • \"The James Dean Story,\" the new Warner film, is introduced to readers of \"Seventeen's\" July issue in a very effective manner. A \"bigger-than- life\" size picture of Dean appears on a two-page spread. The photo is placed in an upright position, which makes it necessarv to turn the maga- zine vertically to properly view Dean's picture. Edwin Miller writes about this lonely hero to round out this attractive text and picture article. WALTER HAAS Tuesday, July 2, 1957 Motion Picture Daily Hurricane Victims Aided Thru Theatre Donations Special to THE DAILY HOUSTON, Tex., July 1 - Among the theatres holding benefits for hur- ricane victims is the Trail Drive-in Theatre here, owned by Jack Farr, who organized a \"Cameron, Louis- iana, Day\" to aid the citizens of that community. Patrons who brought clean, used clothing or canned goods were admitted free on Saturday and Sunday. A film truck rushed the sup- plies to the stricken area. Theatres Hit ( Continued from page 1 ) haven't been received as yet; how- ever, all of the drive-in theatres were reported damaged, some by winds, others by floods, which will keep them closed for some time. A. J. Broussard of Crowley, La., reported both his indoor, the Chief I and Trail Drive - In were damaged 1 badly. Others reporting damages are i Claude, Eunice, La.; Pelican, Jen- 1 nings, La.; Twin Drive-In, Lafayette, ! La.; New Moon and Surf, Lake Charles, La.; Pines, Pinehill, La.; Joy, Alexandria, La.; Yam, Opelousas, La., and the Midway, West Lake La. Dr. Rappaport Named Will Rogers Researcher Dr. Edgar Mayer, medical advisor ' to the board of Will Rogers Memorial ; Hospital and Research Laboratories, anno'in\"°-l yesrerday that Dr. Israel 1 Rappaport, M.D., F.C.C.P., has be- 1 com. . /edow Researcher at the Hos- pital. Dr. Rappaport will transfer his ' present continuing research project to ' the laboratories at Will Rogers, where he will concentrate especially on pul- monary emphysema in general and the aging lung in particular. Dr. Rappaport has been visiting physician in chest service at Bellevue Hospital, and contributed the initiative and con- cepts which were influential in es- tablishing the Research Centre there. He has been consulting physician at Grasslands Hospital, Westchester County, N. Y.; associate clinical pro- fessor, College of Physicians and Sur- geons, Columbia University; and Fel- low of the College of Chest Physi- cians, New York Academy of Medi- Correction The name of Catherine Gaskin, au- thor of the novel \"Meet Miss Morgan\" on which the picture \"Sara Dane\" is based, was misspelled as Goskin in an ad placed by Marcel Hellman in the June 20 issue of Motion Picture Daily. Arbitration Financing Seen Biggest Hurdle ( Continued from page 1 ) controversial film rental provision favored by Allied which consumed months of the last plan brought out in 1955 is absent, but other factors which have risen in the meantime must be considered. Similar to Former Plan The setup presented to the indus- try in September, 1955 was much like the plan presented three years earlier and approved by representa- tives of the Motion Picture Associa- tion, Theatre Owners of America, In- dependent Theatre Owners of New York, Metropolitan Motion Picture Theatre Owners, Southern California Theatre Owners Association. In each instance directors ap- proved and presented the plan to membership meetings. Allied turned it down. No difficulty is expected in getting the Department of Justice to approve a new plan. The 1955 plan provided that it be- come effective three months after Federal court approval. It is figured that it will take at least this amount of time to arrange .details of any new plan, because decisions will be nec- essary on number of local boards. Each will have to select a panel of arbitrators, and arrange for office space. Print Shortage Vital Subject Print shortages have become an acute problem since the 1955 docu- ment was laid aside. What to do about this, if anything, is to be dis- cussed. Some organization representa- tives are reported to favor classify- ing failure to deliver prints as con- tract violations subject to arbitration. Drive-ins are pressing for first runs after downtown showings in many places. This could be a time- consuming subject for the negotiators. Clearance cases made up about 90 per cent of the work of the arbitra- tion plan laid out in Judge Goddard's consent decree.. Clearances also have been the basis of antitrust suits in many states. Each Would Name Appeals Group If the new plan is administered by a National Administration Com- mittee, as was provided by the 1955 draft, the basis of representation probably will be three each for TOA, Allied and the distributors, with one each for MMPTA, ITOA, SCTOA and the International Drive-In Asso- ciation. These will name an appeals board. Business Big ( Continued from page 1 ) Pride and the Passion\" at the Capi- tol.

Loving You Wallis — Paramount — VistaVision Elvis Presley's first picture, \"Love Me Tender,\" for 20th-Fox was one of the surprise box office hits of 1956. His second picture is \"Loving You\" for Hal Wallis and Paramount, and it looks like a sure thing to repeat the success of the first. Only this time no one should be taken unaware. For producer Wallis has observed every possible precaution— and then some— to insure the Presley fans get what they want. First, he has put the high priest of rock 'n' roll in a modern setting, which, of course, is where he belongs. Second, he has had writers Herbert Baker and Hal Kanter contrive a tailor-made script about the meteoric rise of a country boy to showbusiness heights— one which has some intriguing parallels to Presley's real-life career. Third, Wallis has given this film a sumptuous production in Tech- nicolor and VistaVision. Fourth, he has surrounded Presley with such professional talent as Lizabeth Scott, Wendell Corey, and James Gleason. And fifth, and most important of all for the Presley following, he has not stinted in the number of songs provided for the star to sing in his very special style. \"Give us a song, Deke,\" (Presley's name in the story), somebody or other pleads in this picture every five minutes or so. And Presley is no boy to say them nay. There are seven songs in total and he sings some of them more than once. Most are delivered with speed and gusto, accompanied by the familiar body gvrations, but he does slow down somewhat for the title song, a ballad. Appropriately enough, the script serves primarily as a link between the musical numbers, although it also affords the star a chance to play a couple of romantic scenes with newcomer Dolores Hart and some dramatic ones with Miss Scott. The latter portrays a press agent who discovers Preslev and enlists the aid of her ex-husband, played by Corey, in making him a popular attraction. Her tactics to put the singer over include several fanciful publicity stunts some of which seem unethical to both Corey and Preslev, who threaten at different points to walk out on her until she reforms toward the end. The picture was directed by Kanter and derived from a story by Mary Agnes Thompson. Running time, 101 minutes. General classification. Release, in July.
