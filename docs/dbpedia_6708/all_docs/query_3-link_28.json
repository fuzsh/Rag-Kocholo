        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker\n\nKravis made no secret of their desire to have a baby together. Case in point: Kourtney's super sweet pregnancy reveal at a Blink-182 gig this June.\n\nBut their pregnancy journey has not been straightforward. The couple have been incredibly open with fans about their struggle to conceive.\n\nSpeaking about her IVF journey previously, Kourtney revealed: \"[I had] seven frozen eggs from years ago, before Travis.\n\n\"Most of mine didn’t survive the thaw. Freezing of eggs isn’t guaranteed. It’s a misunderstanding.\"\n\nThen, in the Season 3 premiere, Kourtney announced the pair were \"officially done with IVF\", but would still love to welcome a baby.\n\nAnd she's now revealed she went through five failed IVF cycles when trying to conceive.\n\nSpeaking to a fan on Instagram, Kourtney explained: \"I stopped after a year of trying (five failed IVF cycles, three retrievals). My body relaxed, and I believed in God's plan for my life.\"\n\nKourt went on to add she conceived \"100% naturally\" on Valentine's Day. She welcomed baby Rocky in November 2023 - and we could not be happier for the loved-up couple.\n\nAnd the eldest Kardashian sister loves being a mum all over again, telling another follower Rocky \"is never in his crib\".\n\n\"Enjoy every second! We do the same. It's my favourite thing in the world.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nAfter years of (tbh unnecessarily nosy) speculation about whether or not she had plans to become a parent, the Friends star opened up in an interview with Allure in 2022, about how hurtful the constant questioning had been - especially as she'd been unsuccessfully undergoing fertility treatment.\n\n\"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it,\" she shared. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nJennifer added that now, she feels relief that the not knowing is over. \"I have zero regrets, I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.' I don’t have to think about that anymore.\"\n\nSharon Osbourne\n\nIn her autobiography Extreme, Survivor, the Celebrity Big Brother star said she wanted to have a fourth child after the birth of her youngest son, Jack - however, she found the experience of IVF to be gruelling.\n\n\"Sadly, it didn't work. After I had Jack, I got a stomach infection, and I didn't treat it, so the infection spread into my tubes and messed them up,\" she wrote. \"So we went through IVF, but oh my God, I just couldn't take that ride. The wait for the results, for each phone call, was mental torture. It did me in, and I couldn't go through it again.\"\n\nNancy Juvonen and Jimmy Fallon\n\nThe Tonight Show host and his wife opened up about their five-year IVF journey, with Juvonen describing the process as \"emotional\".\n\n“At a certain point it had to almost become a job because it’s way too emotional to live emotionally through that,” said Juvonen. “So you just keep going and going and going, and if you really want something, you just make it happen. And you have all of these things where you go, ‘Yeah, but I would never do that. Yes, but I would never to that, but I would never ...’\n\n\"Then, all the sudden, you’re like, ‘Hey, I’ll do that. If it’s for my family, I’ll do anything.’”\n\nThe pair have two daughters, 10-year-old Winnie and Frances, nine. Both of their children were born via surrogate.\n\nBrooke Shields\n\nThe Jane the Virgin actress explained her difficult journey through IVF in her memoir, Down Came The Rain.\n\n\"The whole process was quite an ordeal, and we became slaves to the time of day and to little vials of liquid,\" Shields wrote. \"We'd find ourselves out at dinner with friends, and then we'd have to sneak off to a coat room, where we'd huddle over syringes and a travel-size cooler filled with small bottles of drugs.\"\n\nShields now has two daughters; her eldest, 21-year-old Rowan, was conceived through IVF. 18-year-old Grier was naturally conceived.\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nThe Bring It On star revealed she struggled to conceive in her tell-all book, We're Going To Need More Wine.\n\nWhen trying to have a baby with husband Dwayne Wade, she wrote: \"I have had eight or nine miscarriages. For three years, my body has been a prisoner of trying to get pregnant— I've either been about to go into an IVF cycle, in the middle of an IVF cycle, or coming out of an IVF cycle.\"\n\nUnion eventually welcomed her daughter, Kaavia James Wade, in 2018 via surrogate.\n\nKristen Wiig\n\nShe welcomed twins via surrogate in 2o19, but before she had her family, the Bridesmaids actor has spoken candidly about her struggle to conceive with her husband, Abi Rothman.\n\n\"We've been together for about five years, and three of them were spent in an [in vitro fertilization] haze,\" she said in a 2020 interview with InStyle. \"You go through so much self-deprecation, and you feel like your partner may be seeing you in a different way and all this other stuff we make up in our heads.\"\n\nHowever, she said she found so much support from friends and loved ones when going through the experience.\n\n\"When I did talk about it, every time I said that I was going through IVF, I would meet someone who was either going through it, about to go through it or had a friend who just did it,\" she said. \"It's like this underground community that's talked about but not talked about.\"\n\nParis Hilton\n\nSocialite Paris Hilton has been open with fans about her \"tough\" IVF journey, including during a previous appearance on The Trend Reporter with Mara podcast.\n\nDuring a 2021 episode, Hilton said she found the egg retrieval process \"tough\" but that she decided it was \"worth it\".\n\n\"I did it a couple of times. Just doing it together and having a partner that is just so supportive and just always makes me feel like a princess all the time... it wasn't that bad,\" recalled Hilton.\n\nSince then, Hilton and her husband Carter Reum have welcomed a son, Phoenix, together. She welcomed her daughter, London, via surrogate, in November 2023.\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend\n\nInitially keeping details of their fertility issues private, Chrissy and John spoke out on their experience after facing difficult questions about when they'd have a child. \"It’s a sweet question. It comes from a good place, but sometimes you never know what the person [is going through],\" she told E! News. \"What you really want to say [is], 'I’m trying and I can't'.\"\n\nShe went on: \"I wanted to talk about it for so long. It didn’t feel right to ever tweet, ‘Ugh, doing my IVF shots again'.\"\n\nAppearing on The Jennifer Hudson Show earlier this year, Legend added: \"We've been open about it because we've had challenges.\"\n\nHe told Hudson: \"We had to use [in vitro fertilization] to conceive our children.
