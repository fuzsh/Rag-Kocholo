        "text": "Peter and the Test Tube Babies Key to the City 12″\n\nThe title track is the only studio cut, and takes up the entire A-side. It’s very long. Its not very interesting. It would be just passable if it were a quarter as long. The B-side contains four live tracks, largely uninspirational save for “Vicars Wank Too” which shows the most pep on the slab.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Hairy Pie\n\nIssue MRR #40 • September 1986\n\nPeter and the Test Tube Babies Pissed and Proud LP\n\nWell, they’ve finally put an album out. The sound quality is so good that you’d never know it was live except for the crowd noise and interaction between the band and audience. These guys produce powerful Oi music, but their themes are questionable, as with most such groups. They have all sorts of songs about “birds”—the English equivalent of “chicks”—and not being able to get off. Then we have the familiar ode to fighting, getting beat up, and the wimps that won’t fight in “Moped Lads.” Socially relevant themes in “Keep England Untidy” tell us to litter, and “Shitstirrer” is where they explain that when things are bad they will make them worse. Their song “Elvis Is Dead” is a classic, though, and “Maniac” is a great pun. But who knows at this point if they’re serious? Fun band to listen to but not to contemplate. They are thugs and proud of it.\n\nReviewer Ruth Schwartz\n\nLabel No Future\n\nIssue MRR #4 • January/February 1983"
