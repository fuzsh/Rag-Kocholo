Merle Connell and produced by George Weiss. It is a narrative about artificial insemination with scenes of nudity and sexual promiscuity included. One scene shows the male lead character's sperm viewed through a microscope.\n\nA young married couple find themselves drifting apart. Wife Cathy Bennet (Dorothy Duke) finds temporary pleasure at swinging parties or in the arms of another man, Frank Grover (John Michael). Husband George Bennet (William Thomason) confronts his wife about the widening chasm between them; she tells him she feels they are somehow incomplete without children. She undergoes testing to see why she hasn't conceived. George, who has accompanied her, is asked to also undergo testing and is found to be the problem: he is sterile. Physician Dr. Wright (Timothy Farrell) suggests artificial insemination using a sperm donor. This proves successful and the Bennetts begin a new and happy phase of their marriage.\n\nDorothy Duke as Cathy Bennett\n\nWilliam Thomason as George Bennett\n\nTimothy Farrell as Dr. Wright\n\nJohn Michael as Frank Grover\n\nPeggy Roach as Cathy's mother\n\nStacey Alexander as Don Williams\n\nGeorgie Barton as Betty Williams\n\nMary Lou Reckow as Dolores LaFleur\n\nBebe Berto as Jerry\n\nGuy Gordon as Phil\n\nHelen Cogan as Grace\n\nGine Franklin as Ralph\n\nZona Siggins as Nurse Mason\n\nList of films in the public domain in the United States"
