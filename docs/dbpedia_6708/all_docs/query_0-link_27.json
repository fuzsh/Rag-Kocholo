Friedman, August Helms, Kit Parker, Shan Sayles, Dan Sonney, Chuck Teitel and Mark Woods, Jr. For their constructive ideas and reactions, we would also like to thank Tim Lucas, David Pierce, Eric Schaefer and Mike Vraney, as well as the staffs of the Margaret Herrick Library (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the Performing Arts Library at Lincoln Center (New York Public Library) and the UCLA Film and Television Archives. Without Gary and Susan Svehla this book would certainly not have been possible. Their confidence and support are evidenced not only in the physical pages before you, but the spirit of the words inhabiting them. Other important supports include Donald Krim and the Kino International family, Matthew Fisher and the designers and programmers at Night Kitchen Media, and Bruce Goldstein and company of Film Forum.\n\n216\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nINTRODUCTION Just as the storybook Hollywood film preaches romantic couplings and happy endings, many histories of the medium offer an idyllic, if inaccurate, view of an era of cinema dreamily referred to as the Golden Age. Commemorating the biggest and the best while offering lower-profile films and filmmakers little more than disdain, traditional film history has often denied the fact that motion pictures began as a lowbrow entertainment for the uneducated masses. In elaborate theaters such as S.L. Rothafel’s New York Roxy (self-proclaimed “Cathedral of the Motion Picture”) and Sid Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, armies of dapper ushers may have escorted patrons across red carpets and along marble balustrades, but most American movie houses at that time more closely resembled the Lyric Theatre of Tuckahoe, New York, as described by journalist Art Seidenbaum: A squat of plaster between a drugstore and a shoe store... The architecture was forgettable, a rectangle of four walls, slightly curved to suggest aspirations of art moderne. No balcony. No center aisle. No sculpture, no cherubs or open skies on the ceiling.1 While a few of the more fortunate movie palaces have been saved from the wrecking ball by historical societies and ambitious chambers of commerce, the small-town, single-screen Main Street theaters continue to quietly succumb to the destructive forces of economic progress, pulled to the ground without fanfare or remorse to make room for parking lots to service new shopping malls that cancerously expand, spawning franchise video rental stores and shoe-box multiplexes. As these modest emblems of a bygone era vanish into oblivion, the complex secrets disappear that these sturdy sentinels once contained. It’s a history of the American movies that doesn’t jibe with the accepted, idealistic view; a story of brash, vulgar films and a cine-subculture driven by unmitigated greed and the puckish desire to flaunt authority, populated by figures who have long since faded into obscurity. Cataracts of nostalgia and historical ignorance fog our view of the movie past, obscuring the disreputable pictures that often stained the screens of middle America. Photographs and reenactments of jolly children storming the matinee box office or smartly dressed couples munching popcorn in the reassuring glow of the projected image deny the existence of a mysterious breed of film that was occasionally unspooled in these same picture houses. The crowds that queued up along the sidewalks to see these films more closely resembled the throngs of jobless men or women in the breadlines of Depression-stricken New York. Like the shaggier, worn-at-the-elbows crowds they attracted, these films weren’t the luminous fantasies sent down from a Hollywood onhigh. Their images were generally poorly composed and photographed, the prints were battered and coated in scratches, resisting the technical basics of focus and coherent sound. But the greatest difference between these lowly films and their reputable cousins wasn’t so much form as content. The crowds who trudged to these utilitarian Main Street theaters sought a break from Hollywood make-believe. They came seeking reality in undiluted doses. What 8\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nthey actually found was a bizarre mixture of the two: saccharine morality tales interrupted by moments of raw, ugly truth that studio films would never dare broach. Behind its innocuous title, the 1944 film Mom and Dad (the slick, big-budget Gone With the Wind of the exploitation cinema) contained a cargo of bodily trauma. The film regaled crowds of anxious men and women with graphic shots of human bodies covered with ugly raw blisters and chancres. A mouth is opened wide to permit a closer view of a gaping hole in the palate. Detailed closeups showcase flesh rotting away from swollen, discolored eye-sockets. The ravages of venereal disease are shown in remarkable, painful detail. Men and women with their faces hidden, move their bodies, turning arms and legs, opening mouths and reveal their pocked genitalia to allow healthy Americans an intimate look at its worst nightmare, an affront to the national virtue. Exploring not only the most sordid consequence of sexual intercourse, but also the most sublime, Mom and Dad also exposed the gruesome beauty of childbirth at a time when it was more of a mystery to the average American than ever before. Heralding a new age in American health care, deliveries were now performed, not at home by family members and midwives, but in sterilized surgical theaters from which relatives were prohibited. A new taboo surrounding the pregnant woman’s body cloaked the grisly reality of childbirth, which Mom and Dad was all too happy to reveal. While the respectable citizenry euphemistically referred to pregnancy as “being in a family way” or “expecting,” Mom and Dad adopted the less gleeful phrase “in trouble,” which characterized child-bearing as more of a curse than a blessing. A portion of Mom and Dad consists of a sex hygiene lecture illustrated by an instructional film delivered to a classroom of students (mirroring those in the movie house receiving an education of their own). The Story of Birth, as the movie-withinthe-movie is called, presents animated drawings of the reproductive system, documenting the biological melodrama that has unfurled in countless health classes across the nation, of the movement of spermatozoa into the uterus, and the subsequent growth of the fetus within the womb. The climax of the film, however, is a live-action jolt after the quaintly oblique diagrams; a graphic motion picture image of a woman, barely visible and cloaked in an expanse of white sheets, giving birth. A doctor’s hands lure a baby’s head from her vagina. Blood gushes from her body. In the triumphant moment, the entire wriggling newborn is outstretched in a fluid tableaux against his anonymous mother’s headless body, kicking against the cold air. His mouth is open but no sound issues forth. And the film’s pièce de résistance? The childbirth equivalent of a rabbit pulled from a magician’s hat: a bold encore in which a second baby is drawn not from between a woman’s legs but directly through her stomach via a cesarean incision. Dozens of such films were exhibited in the big-city and small-town theaters of America, motion pictures later christened “exploitation films” for capitalizing on such delicate issues as venereal disease, childbirth, drug abuse, abortion, prostitution, polygamy, nudism and a host of other thrillingly unwholesome topics. Of these films, Mom and Dad, “a lighthouse in the dismal darkness of human ignorance” as its producer cooed in typically florid fashion, was the most popular, reputed to have grossed over $100 million during its lifespan. A spectacle of flesh and finger-wagging cautionary tale, Mom and Dad stands out as the film which best represents the many bizarre and compelling facets of this seldom-discussed genre. The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n9\n\nLooking more like a Depression-era breadline than festive moviegoers, these sex education-starved women circle the block for a segregated screening of Dwain Esper’s Modern Motherhood, complete with “Dynamic Sex Lecture.”\n\nPrior to the advent of television and home video, the commercial life of a Hollywood picture was measured in weeks. Mom and Dad, on the other hand, had a “screen life” of more than 20 years, steadily criss-crossing the nation in an erratic route more akin to the carnival’s perennial course than the limited shelf-life of the film distribution loop. Though it boasted an “All Star Cast,” this enticement seemed part of the hopeful deception that fueled exploitation; few of the faces in the film were recognizable. But exploitation’s strongest selling point was not the “who” but the what, and the glorious spectacle of blood and flesh anticipated like the sickening lurch of a roller coaster plunging down its iron tracks. Oftentimes a film was given a greater novelty value and the magic of a one-of-a-kind performance by the presence of a live lecturer who traveled with the film and introduced it to the local audience, often with the help of several assistants. The question one inevitably faces when exploring the exploitation film is “why bother?” Is there anything of merit in these crudely produced movies shamelessly engineered to separate an undiscerning public from its hard-earned greenbacks? In a 10\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\npostmodern culture enamored with ironic distance, exploitation films have become yet another relic of an assumedly kitschy past, a diversionary giggle for fans of the outré to plug into VCRs between Russ Meyer and John Waters videos. Can we learn anything about the art and industry of cinema in its first 100 years from these lowbrow features that received little national attention and were forgotten a few years after they were made? The answer is an unqualified yes. A bounty of insight into the history of the cinema and, also the culture of the 1930s and ’40s, can be gleaned from the exploitation film... if one only looks beyond their often hackneyed and amateurish surface. Just as the visual arts have come to embrace the folk art of unschooled, “primitive” artists, exploitation should be seen in a similar light: a cinematic naif art as revealing and sublime as the more polished work of establishment filmmakers. Exploitation is cinema in the raw. It delivers its visceral charge without the polish and pretense that characterize the critics’ darlings: the studio mega-productions and cultish low-budget art films. And as much as the respectable cinema would like to ignore this bastard sibling—laughing it off as camp, schlock or golden turkeys—it lingers resolutely about the fringe, an unwelcome reminder of what, beneath all the multi-million-dollar dressings, the American cinema has always been and continues to be about. Stare into the face of cinema. Strip away the pomp and glory, the high literary subjects and chintzy gold-plated statuettes and you will see, not the lofty ideals of visionary artists, but weary bodies slapping against one another in love and in anger, overwrought melodramas, unabashed carnality, hollow morality, low comedy and carnivalesque theatricality. Within cavernous, sweltering soundstages, actors and technicians struggle madly at their trade, watched over and motivated not by some common muse but by a bottom-line Philistine, rubbing his palms together in anxious anticipation of a film’s opening grosses. Both the exploitation hack and his highbrow Hollywood cousin may dream occasionally of laurels; but they lust for the sum total of all the dimes, quarters and dollars that can be wrested from the fingers of a fickle public. Modern-day movie advertising, with its high concepts and its trumpeting of critical accolades (which proclaim every movie the best of its kind), are only “tasteful” imitations of the gaudy lobby displays and sensational posters offering timeless queries like “What Makes a Husband Untrue?” and “What Causes Frigid Wives?” and feverish promises to fulfill every dream and reveal every secret. At the heart of every film—highbrow or low—is a promise of solace or excitement, one of the endless catalog of vicarious pleasures absent from ordinary life. The desire for escape or revelation which drew exploitation moviegoers into the grubby palaces of education and bottom-feeding vice are only less refined versions of the same desires felt by a 1930s shop girl attending an Astaire and Rogers musical, a ’50s family of four slurping Cokes at the Miracle Mile drive-in, a ’70s film student in a crowded classroom seeking vicarious flight from the encroaching responsibilities of adulthood. During its most prolific, definitive, two-decade reign, the exploitation film thrived in America, tearing away the trappings of respectability and allowing the public to revel in all its crude, bare-bones majesty. Along the way, these strange little films irrevocably altered the course of film history with a cultural sucker-punch that will continue to be felt on movie screens for many years. Looking upon the exploitation film’s remnants, like leaves in a teacup in a midway palmistry hut, we can discern far more about the cinema than its creators ever imagined their quickly assembled audience flytraps were capable of revealing. 11 The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\nChapter One THE EXPLOITATION PHENOMENON When people lived by the land the facts of life came in a natural way. Modern complex city life has made it necessary for each individual to gain his knowledge through scholastic education, parental instructions, or through reading and study, supplemented by observation and experience. Sex knowledge is vitally important to persons of every age and station in life, and is essential for happiness and wellbeing. —Hildagarde Esper, Your Sex Questions Answered... What Every Modern Mother and Father Should Know Before sex education invaded secondary school curricula and Hollywood dared expose the bronzed flesh of its icons to the prying eyes of lowly ticket-buyers, there were few sources of sexual information and titillation. Stolen glances at medical encyclopedias, National Geographics and bathing relatives were all the education some were allowed, while the more adventurous might glimpse the wonders of copulation in Tijuana Bibles, the vulgar, pocket-sized eight-page comics where unlicensed effigies of Popeye and Moon Mullins waved two-foot penises beneath the jaded, unimpressed eyes of Betty Boop or Mae West. In the prevailing darkness and uncertainty of the Great Depression, the exploitation film positioned itself as the forum where this widely shared, desperate hunger for carnal enlightenment was satisfied. In myriad small towns across America, the independent theater was akin to the biblical tree of knowledge. Beguiled by serpents in black suits distributing colorful handbills, unschooled Adams and Eves approached the tree, nervously passed a quarter through the semicircular archway cut in the box office glass, then slinked inside to sit in the ice-cooled shade of the theater’s velvet and gilt boughs. With darkness’ descent came luminous revelation of society’s most tantalizing forbidden fruit. The implications of tasting this tainted apple were unclear. One could never be sure whether exploitation filmmakers were more concerned with imparting a life-enriching moral lesson or just gaily (and graphically) depicting a character’s moral plunge into depravity. Sure, Ann Dixon’s 11th-hour plea for her parents’ forgiveness puts a sweet family-values closure on Road to Ruin. But it’s a wan, watery finale to a film more interested in the gross and sordid tale of two bad, bad girls learning a hard lesson about the clap, wily playboys and backroom abortions. The film’s last-minute “message” has all the sincerity of a Catholic schoolgirl repenting in morning confession for her previous night’s sins even as she plots her next evening’s adventures. The illuminating message that each exploitation film offered as a matter of course was little more than a standard, half-hearted effort to placate public officials who might attempt to censor the film and to accommodate the viewer who needed the pretense of 12\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\neducation to allow herself to indulge in such prurient displays. The secret to endurance in the field of exploitation was an ability to maintain a pretense of serving a high moral purpose no matter how iniquitous one’s films. Dwain and Hildagarde Esper, a husband and wife director and screenwriter of exploitation classics such as How to Undress, Narcotic, Modern Motherhood and Marihuana: Weed With Roots in Hell and two of the genre’s most notorious figures, were careful not to call their work “sex pictures,” “drug movies” or “exploitation films.” Instead, the couple referred rather euphemistically to their films as “sensational pic- As this 14” x 22” window card illustrates, marijuana was only tures,” a socially accept- one of many vices exploited in Dwain Esper’s 1936 feature. able term that disguised the carnality of their film collaborations. The fact that the Espers devoted significant creative energy to at least two films investigating the important anthropological topic of native women mating with gorillas (Forbidden Adventure and Bo-ru the Ape Boy) should arouse a healthy dose of skepticism toward the nobility of their crusade. The viewer had no way of knowing in advance how ripe—or just plain rotting on the vine—the fruit being served to them would be, since virtually all exploitation films were promoted at the same pitch of demented sensationalism. While revelations of the secrets of humankind’s degeneration were promised with every poster, handbill and print ad, the film itself might deliver anything from a cranky dowager’s tedious lecture on the errors of today’s youth, to the fascinating image of a fetus being violently forcepped from a glistening womb. Those precious seconds in which unclothed skin was at last exposed to the lens might offer up the nubile breasts of giggling skinnydippers or a syphilitic penis being fondled with black rubber gloves to expose the areas of greatest decay. Like a game of three-card monte, you could either win big, or walk away with the sickening feeling of a concave-chested lad after his first dance with a The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n13\n\nKisses were always slightly bitter in the sin-infested world of exploitation, as shown in this still from What Price Innocence? (Photofest)\n\ncrafty B-girl, of being magnificently had. The mystery that surrounded each screening was part of the serpentine charm the exploitation film offered its anxious viewer. If it was, as roadshowman David Friedman has suggested, curiosity that drew crowds to exploitation, it was the paradoxical narcotic of fascination and revulsion also found in horror and pornography that kept them glued to their seats. Or in some cases, passed out under them; grown men were often reduced to swooning maidens by the sight of a gory C-section. Not ones to waste any scrap of scandal, exploiteers would then have these faint victims transported to cots in the theater lobby to highlight the unique thrills of that night’s screening. And exhibitors seemed pleased with the results of such garish showmanship. As a theater owner showing 1933’s sex education picture about a girl rendered pregnant out-of-wedlock, who drowns herself in shame in What Price Innocence? was happy to attest in one of the typically breathless dispatches from the motion picture frontier: Put forth an extra effort on this picture and was amply rewarded. It’s one of these program picture [sic] that come along once in a while that brings you out of the red caused by last high priced so-called special played. Your patrons will walk out satisfied. That is, when their wobbly knees could carry them. 14\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nExploitation films often appeared to be the tarnished, lowborn remedy for rural and small-town box offices crippled by the Hollywood practice of block-booking, who fought back with the seemingly sure-fire money-making antidote of exploitation. Nudism films proved especially fortuitous crowd-pleasers. A Pilot Point, Texas theater owner who played Elysia to an over-16 crowd trying “to take care of some of my losses on the lemons I have been getting,” found that “business was good,” adding of the exploiteer’s classic bait-and-switch strategy he employed: Though it really is in the nude, it is a lot cleaner picture than a lot of the ones I have been showing. It will get the money if you advertise it as hot and that they shouldn’t see it, etc., but after they have seen it they will tell you that it wasn’t so hot. 2 The title and subject of a film were never clear indicators of what would ultimately appear on screen, though salivation-triggering words like “Suicide,” “Vice,” “Slaves” and “Sex” suggested it wasn’t going to be a ladies tea. Exploiteers, sensation size-queens, often veered madly from their educational itinerary as if driven by the same intractable, libidinal urges that led their naive protagonists to ruin, so that a film such as They Must Be Told (aka Sex Madness, 1938)—ostensibly made as a treatise on the 20th-century’s venereal plague of syphilis—dramatized not just ordinary premarital sex but prostitution, lesbianism and child molestation. Of all exploiteers, Esper seemed the least apt to be constrained by a single topic. His biblical phantasmagoria The Seventh Commandment (1932), dramatizing the consequences of adultery, also treated viewers to glimpses of strip poker, transvestitism, lesbianism, syphilis, a cesarean birth and, should this catalog of depravity fail to tantalize, a grisly facelift operation—all in a scant 65 minutes. For its sins, Esper’s film was formally condemned as “indecent, obscene, im- Original one-sheet poster from Dwain Esper’s first moral.” It was also condemned film, The Seventh Commandment, of which only a small because it would “tend to corrupt fragment survives today. morals.” The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n15\n\nThis window card from one of many reissues of Louis Gasnier’s Reefer Madness demonstrates the “title switch” (the film was previously released as Tell Your Children), as well as the practice of plagiarizing poster art (see photo 189). The film was also released as The Burning Question. 16\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nExploitation films are frequently dismissed for their rabid responses to such harmless threats as marijuana—rendering wholesome kids homicidal maniacs in three puffs. The most famous exploitation film of all time, Reefer Madness was offered to modern audiences as a joke, thereby setting the tone for later reception of exploitation. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) stumbled upon a print of the film and began screening it in 1971 as a means of mocking the government’s demonization of the mild narcotic. Soon thereafter, indie distributor New Line Cinema began exhibiting the film to midnight movie audiences who guffawed at its campy cluelessness and added Sex Madness and Cocaine Fiends as two other rusty souvenirs from a dumber age. Many exploitation films are badly dated and quite campy in their treatment of American vice—and naturally enjoyable for the laughter they sometimes induce. As one of Reefer Madness’ own performers, Thelma White (who played the vampy Mae, whose apartment is the setting for wild reefer parties) affirmed, exploitation filmmakers did their utmost to produce films that would provoke a visceral response in audiences. “The director wanted us to ‘hoke’ it up. He wanted us to show the ‘madness.’ ” But unlike actor Timothy Farrell, who seemed to take some of exploitation’s incompetence in stride, White was less pleased by her brief stint in its ranks. An RKO contract player loaned out by the studio to make Reefer Madness, White saw the film as an embarrassing footnote to her small-scale career, though it was ultimately her most lasting and famous role. She remarked: “I’m ashamed to say that it’s the only one of my films that’s become a classic.”3 But the hysteria surrounding marijuana in the 1930s was no less rabid than the Juvenile Delinquency scare of the 1950s, the LSD paranoia of the 1960s or the crackphobia of the 1980s. Like many drug wars it was a veiled campaign to regulate private behavior. Exploitation capitalized on misinformation and ignorance to ostensibly save gullible youth from the temptations of narcotics, in a manner no less fanatical than the government authorities and supposedly educated sources fanning the same fires of hophead hysteria. Exploitation filmmakers were hardly goodwill ambassadors duped by the government into fighting a war on drugs. Rather than the hayseeds contemporary audiences (many of whom actually believed the government’s claims that reefer was a short road to insanity) often take them for, exploiteers were crafty business people who found a way to profit from society’s widespread ignorance and insatiable curiosity. And the more that we learn about the men and women who made such films, the more it appears that they approached the subject matter with tongue planted firmly in cheek, skillfully exploiting America’s fears, playfully exaggerating the dangers of vice and, in the end, pocketing the millions of dollars in dimes and quarters offered by a confused populace in search of enlightenment and titillation. As late as 1972, Dwain Esper was able to convince an Arizona Supreme Court jury that his films (including Reefer Madness, a film the notoriously wily Esper did not even direct) were sponsored by the U.S. Government. Shan Sayles, who was engaged in the lawsuit, recalls: He testified under oath in court that that film had been made by him at the request of the United States government and he convinced a jury of that, which was absolutely a blatant lie. And it was absoThe Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n17\n\nlutely amazing how he was able to manipulate this jury—not only through his story but through his manner and his dress, what have you, of being a good ole boy. 4 Just as the exploiteer’s primary concern was not liberating his customers from the catacombs of ignorance, moviegoers also turned to exploitation for something beyond moral betterment. The explorations of vice promised vivid displays of human shame and debauchery, and it was for this dramatization that tickets were purchased. The resurgent camp interest in films like Reefer Madness often presumes cinema has evolved into a more enlightened, knowing medium, far more sophisticated than creaky, amateurish exploitation. But in reality, current film is only more practiced at hiding its replaying of old conventions. The “camp” or “kitsch” response to exploitation assumes contemporary viewers are somehow more “in the know” than the exploiteers who were themselves a crew of lowbrow pranksters, charlatans, hucksters and rebels living outside middlebrow notions of good taste and earning an honest living—committed to making a sawbuck off the public thirst for flesh parades. Obviously the exploitation cinema’s role as a legitimate educational tool was as spurious as the pedophilic scoutmaster professing to teach his young charges the merits\n\nAnother gullible teen falls prey to the temptation of marijuana in a scene from Reefer Madness (1936).

The filmmakers’ underlying, ultimate apathy and comprehension of drug or reproductive issues all affected these films and the degree of truth, conjecture or outright bad advice they gave their audiences. It is too late now to assess what effect these mixed messages preached within a context of greater sexual repression had upon yesteryear’s youth. One can only look back at this distant era and wonder. As with any genre, from film noir to melodrama, there is no absolute formula for defining which films belong in the fold. However, it is possible to assemble a very reliable model of the typical exploitation film by examining the genre’s distinctive features. Exploitation (as in “the act of exploiting”) has always been and will undoubtedly remain a central facet of the motion picture industry as a whole. The specific exploitation movement chronicled in this book, however, is of a particular style, practiced in its most representative phase in an era that coincides with Hollywood’s most repressive censorship. The Production Code instituted in 1934 and outmoded by the mid-1950s defined the parameters of exploitation’s most prolific decades and allowed exploitation to flourish as an alternative to its strictures. The exploitation films of these years were characterized by a kind of tabloid sensationalism, devoting thousands of feet of celluloid to topics unsuitable for dinner-table discussion. In flagrantly bogus crusades of public betterment, filmmakers used these issues as a license to indulge in every imaginable vice. Often there was an effort to maintain a certain dignity and sensitivity when addressing these delicate subjects, but more often the “problem” was dramatized, The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n19\n\nhyperbolized and demonized to such gross extremes that it hardly constitutes a serious investigation of social ills. If defined according to the moral pitfalls depicted on screen, the exploitation film can be divided into five general categories: drug scare, sex education, wayward women, documentary and social problem film. DRUG SCARE. Probably the best known exploitation film is Tell Your Children, re-introduced in typically tongue-in-cheek, comical fashion to the midnight movie circuit in the 1970s under the title Reefer Madness by New Line Cinema. This picture of teenagers turned into sex maniacs and killers by marijuana may have looked outrageously campy to a savvier, post-1960s audience taught that harder drugs like LSD and Angel Dust were the real menace. But Reefer Madness is at times a genuinely disturbing look at the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde transformation drugs can inspire; no less troubling a glimpse into the unfettered human psyche than Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic novel. Dramatizing the physical and moral decay brought on by a few “harmless” puffs of marijuana, the drug scare film was sure to prominently feature an element of sex, capped off with harsh retribution for the curious drug user. Other titles in this subgenre include Marihuana: Weed With Roots in Hell, Wild Weed (aka She Shoulda Said ‘No’!), Assassin of Youth, Narcotic, The Pace That Kills (aka Cocaine Fiends), The Devil’s Harvest and The Devil’s Sleep (aka Hopped Up). Audiences were invited to experience Dwain Esper’s Narcotic as not only a SEX EDUCATION. Depicting the prodrug expose, but as a voyeuristic glimpse cess by which naive couples are schooled in of sexual depravity. the perils and pleasures of sexual activity, marital advice films constituted a considerable portion of the exploitation genre. Usually involving the stern warnings and warm wishes of a paternal family doctor (who always seemed to have a 16mm projector and a few reels of syphilis footage handy to freak out his young patients), the sex-ed films ushered the ignorant pupils (be they on screen or in the theater) into a bright future of monogamy and sexual well-being. Titles include Damaged Lives, Damaged Goods, Because of Eve, The Story of Bob and Sally, and Mom and Dad. One film, Mated (sometimes referred to as Mismated), dispensed with the narrative format altogether, and functioned as a direct feature-length illustrated lecture covering virtually every aspect of reproductive health and disease. Unfortunately, Mated offered none of the wit and charm that makes the exploitation drama so endearing and so ripe for parody, as in the 1975 exploitation film send-up The Rocky Horror Picture Show, with its clash of sparkling innocence and deforming sexuality.

In a definitively 20th-century continuation of such cautionary tales and tragedies, exploitation films revealed the dire consequences of parking, petting and curfew-breaking more effectively than any maternal lecture or Sunday sermon... although most mothers and ministers would not have devoted quite so much lascivious attention to the girls’ tumble from grace as the exploitation films did. By film’s end, the once-innocent girl inevitably found herself a victim of white slavery, pregnant and unmarried, syphilitic or having narrowly escaped one of these ever-present threats to high school virtue. The Road to Ruin, Wages of Sin, Slaves in Bondage, Reckless Decision, They Must Be Told, Enlighten Thy Daughter and Mad Youth exemplify the wayward women phenomenon. DOCUMENTARY. Explored in detail in chapter seven, the exploitation documentary used a mingling of authentic and fraudulent footage to expose the horrors and thrills of a schizophrenic range of subjects, from American crime to the sexual lawlessness of exotic African jungles, backed by typically sensational ad campaigns, overbearing voice-over narration and the requisite injection of exploitation’s contradictory mire of titillating and revolting imagery. SOCIAL PROBLEM. Endeavoring to broaden the exploitation boundaries of sex and drugs, many filmmakers developed projects around other controversies of the day, taking sensitive issues and splashing them like tabloid newspaper headlines across theater marquees. Quite often the filmmakers avoided taking a stand on either side of the issue in a mimicry of journalistic objectivity or else freakishly contradicted themselves 22\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nby arguing both sides of the case in adherence to the exploitation tradition of never completely grasping the mechanics of the controversy in the first place (as in the examination of forced sterilization in Tomorrow’s Children). These exploitation films tackled the topics of abortion (Race Suicide), child marriage (Child Bride), nudism (Elysia, Unashamed), the Ku Klux Klan (Nation Aflame) and polygamy (Polygamy). Religion even found itself the subject of several exploitation films. Knowing better than to point their critical lens at any widely shared belief, the exploiteers targeted scripture-twisting fanatics whom even the most devout worshiper would shun as in The Lash of the Penitentes, about a rogue religious group founded by Franciscan friars traveling with Spain’s conquistadors, whose repertoire of worship is a Bettie Page/Catholicism hybrid of flagellation, crucifixion and torture. Instead of ideological mavericks unleashing their twisted, anti-establishment vision on their audiences, exploitation’s makers were often just as conservative, moralistic, sexist or racist as Hollywood though they exhibited a far more populist, flavorful and hysterical streak. In addition to matters of content, exploitation is characterized by distinctive methods of production, distribution and exhibition, as well as unique narrative structures and idiosyncratic visual devices. Such films are always low-budget independent productions and not the well-financed product of any of the major studios of the day. In fact, true exploitation films were a rung or two below the economic and respectability levels of not only the minor studios (such as Columbia and Republic) but also the so-called Poverty The Lash of the Penitentes proved Row producers (Monogram, Educational, PRC that even religious fanaticism in the and Mascot), into whose soundstages some ex- form of a New Mexican cult could ploitation producers scrambled after hours, leas- be profitable if marketed with a little ing the studio’s equipment and tailoring their sex appeal. scripts to take proper advantage of any standing sets at their disposal. If properly organized, a typical feature could be shot in a single week though a glossier production like Reefer Madness might take a luxurious three weeks to wrap. Exploitation films were produced not with studio money but usually from the investments of the same few self-made moguls—men such as J.D. Kendis, Kroger Babb, The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n23\n\nLouis Sonney, Dwain Esper and Willis Kent—who booked the films into theaters and in some cases traveled the byways of America to preside over the screenings first-hand. No fancy logos opened their films; the companies that they headed were short-lived concerns (Jay Dee Kay, Hygienic Productions, Roadshow Attractions, Hollywood Producers and Distributors and Real Life Productions, respectively) that have long since vanished from the corporate registry. A small crew, a sketchy script, an unrehearsed cast and a few thousand dollars were all that was needed to gain entry into the exploitation fold. The beauty of the exploitation business was that success did not depend upon being born Main Street Girl was most likely an alternate title for into a certain class or professionally established family. It J.D. Kendis’ Street Corner (1950). required no formal training, just some hustle, bravado and an imagination both fertile and devious. A few good ideas and a driving determination to profit from breaking social taboos turned unsophisticated Everymen into prosperous film executives. The size of one’s hometown seemed inversely proportionate to the size of one’s success in the field. Exploitation’s high priests came from the most brackish of backwater towns and exacted a kind of poetic vengeance upon their humble origins by plowing headlong into precisely the big-city vice they were warned of in their hayseed boyhood. Lees Creek, Ohio incubated the wily spirit of Kroger Babb; while Anniston, Alabama yielded Dave Friedman; Snohomish, Washington produced Dwain Esper. Previous occupations were likewise no indication of a future exploiteer’s success. Babb was a professional sports referee, Esper a building contractor, J.D. Kendis a jeweler and Louis Sonney a policeman in Centralia, Washington. They were men who translated their hardscrabble backgrounds, many of them cutting their teeth on the deprivations of the Great Depression, into a brass tacks work ethic of making the most from the least. Exploitation actor Timothy Farrell, whose brilliantined hair, meticulously groomed sardine moustache and monotonal delivery make him exploitation’s cut-rate Clark Gable, recalled the filmmaking process under producer George Weiss (Screen Classics) in the late 1940s and early ’50s. When playing a central role, Farrell noted he typically worked: 24\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nThree days of the five days’ shooting, making the magnificent sum of $300 for the movie. It was a little over SAG minimum... We used the Jack Miles Studios in Larchmont, but mostly Quality Pictures on Santa Monica Boulevard, which was owned or leased by Merle Connell. And Merle, I think he did a lot of the set work, just like Jack Miles at his studio, building the sets, etc.5 In addition to the regular Poverty Row studios whose stages were always available for a price, there were several facilities that catered to the ultra-low-budget exploiteer. Foremost among these was the EVI Complex (“Capital of the Exploitation-Film Industry” its ads proudly proclaimed), built by Louis Sonney circa 1948. Located in Los Angeles along Cordova Street (a block removed from the more mainstream Film Row of Vermont Ave. and Washington Blvd.), the complex included office and storage space, leasable production equipment and even an Art Department where the eager exploiteer could start concocting a juicy ad campaign—as important to a film’s success as the movie itself, maybe more so. Dwain Esper entered the business first as a landlord, leasing production and post-production space at 843 Seward in Hollywood. Chicago’s exploitation filmmakers had their own Film Row on Wabash Avenue, and New York had the Film Center Building at 630 9th Avenue, among other facilities in the outlying boroughs. Willis Kent often staged his moral sagas at the rag-tag sounding “Ralph Like’s International Studios.” Production was carried out by unemployed technicians, free-lancers, aspiring artists and former studio professionals whose careers had been dashed by an unshakable propensity for drink. A number of Babb’s exploitation classics were directed by once-notable filmmaker William Beaudine, who first entered the industry in 1909 under D.W. Griffith, and who later achieved notoriety with a pair of Mary Pickford films (Little Annie Rooney, 1926 and Sparrows, 1926), but whose battle with the bottle poisoned his career at the major studios. After a period of expatriate filmmaking in England, he returned to America to enjoy a long and prosperous career on filmdom’s poverty row, where one’s attention span need only last\n\nBefore contributing his directorial talents to Mom and Dad, William Beaudine made a series of high-profile silent films, including Little Annie Rooney (1925).\n\nA 1936 exploitation poster from an unknown studio\n\nThe Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n25\n\nas long as a day’s shoot. In 1944, the year in which he directed Mom and Dad, the movie marketplace saw the release of an astonishing 10 Beaudine opuses. Big-studio veteran Erle C. Kenton also began his career in silents (under Mack Sennett) and had directed an Abbott and Costello film, Island of Lost Souls and dozens of other obscure and significant Hollywood films before helming One Too Many and The Story of Bob and Sally. After making these exploitation titles, he took another professional step down and became a popular television director. J.D. Kendis engaged as his veteran director Elmer Clifton, who, before directing dozens of routine melodramas in the 1910s and ’20s, was prominently featured as an actor in D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. Cinematographer At one time a prominent actor—starring in D.W.

Having shot Willis Kent’s The Pace That Kills, he achieved renown as the director of photography on such films as Stalag 17, The Big Knife and It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. Actress Betty Grable also found fame after appearing in the “lite” exploitation film Probation as wayward 17-year-old Ruth Jarrett, involved with an aristocratic playboy engaged to be married. Farrell described the camaraderie and chaos that characterized the typical exploitation production. Most of these features were shot by William Thompson. Bill Thompson was the oldest active cinematographer at the time... He started with Edison back in New York... There was a fellow who was George Tallis’ first assistant camera operator and Art Lasky, the ex-prize fighter was the second assistant. Well Art was legitimately blind in one eye from fighting and couldn’t see very well out of the other one. Bill Thompson wore fairly thick glasses. So did the first assistant, who was sort of a drinker... That was the Three Stooges out there, setting up this stuff at night without a lot of light. Bill tripped over 26\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nthe curb once or twice, he couldn’t see where he was going! It was a kick! To see those three guys. I really thought that first night we were going to have problems. I really thought they weren’t going to get anything the way they were going. But apparently it all came out. 6 The aesthetics of the exploitation film were understandably erratic as a result, but deliciously so, carrying the viewer on a bumpy ride through its pot-holed, back-alley narrative in a welcome departure from the slickly staged Hollywood production, which tended to present life in a high-gloss vacuum. While exploiteers cobbled together a film from a haphazard jumble of previously established conventions, found footage and skimpy budgets, Hollywood was adopting a militaristic approach to filmmaking, striving to factor the messy, uncontrollably human element out. Back at the feudal gates of the major studios, producers were following the lead of boy genius Irving Thalberg, the taskmaster who shaped the M-G-M of the 1930s into the acme of movie glamour and prestige with his combination of artistic insight and shark-like business tactics. In an effort to develop a uniform product, M-G-M instituted a mode of factory-style film production in which projects moved steadily through a series of Fordian assembly lines without any one person devoting too much attention to any particular task. Where once a closeknit team of artists collaborated on a project from beginning to end, usually working together on a series of films, Thalberg’s new “producer-unit” system put them under the pencil of a central producer, who supervised the production of several pictures simultaneously and in rapid succession. With all the precision and artistic acumen of a shipping clerk, he broke apart crews and rearranged the parts to meet stringent production deadlines, keeping each individual busy at all times performing his or her clearly Shunning the high-art pretense of the typical madefined duties, with very little jor-studio release, films such as Confessions of a Vice awareness of the project’s evolution Baron (aka Smashing the Vice Trust) sold sex in the outside of their narrow focus.

(Photofest)\n\nthe rate of production but to avoid fluctuation in the quality of output, so that the artist whose signature was represented in the finished product was not the director’s or screenwriter’s or actor’s, but the studio’s. Not too surprisingly, this method diminished the positive influence an individual artist might have on a film if allowed to involve him or herself in its construction on more than one clearly demarcated stage. Films in the ’30s, ’40s and much of the ’50s took on a uniform appearance because of this methodical, profit-based approach to creativity: crisply photographed, clearly recorded, skillfully acted, directed and edited in accordance with well-established rules of cinematic storytelling. This quality became known as “invisible style,” and is one of the defining features of the Classical Hollywood Cinema, as the era was later christened with a congratulatory air. The exploitation cinema stands in direct contrast to, and in defiant revolt against, the CHC on multiple levels, aesthetics foremost. The exploitation pictures’ minimalist production values, stilted dialogue, maladroit performances and fragmented narratives clashed with the films viewers ordinarily watched at first-run theaters. At odds with the fluid design of the streamlined Hollywood production were a succession of films punctuated by jump cuts, overexposed daylight scenes, underexposed interiors and actors incapable of producing tears (and often lines of dialogue) on cue. In an expository rhythm as familiar to exploitation aficionados as the conventions of a fairy tale are to a six-year-old, the films set up prototypical storylines which were freely embellished at the whim of their directors. 28\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nA concerned social worker (Luana Walters, left) attempts to save confused teen Adele Pearce from a life of sin and shame in No Greater Sin. (Photofest)\n\nThe basic exploitation formula is well illustrated by 1941’s No Greater Sin, a paradigmatic venereal disease tract directed by Hollywood veteran William Nigh for University Film Productions. In a town hall meeting, an assembly of women’s group representatives, newspapermen and health officials debate the future of their fair ’burg, thus establishing the pious status quo... soon to be tainted. Lurking in the shadow of the upstanding citizenry is a contingent of troublemakers, often endowed with suspiciously swarthy good looks and sinister ethnic names, like No Greater Sin’s silverThe Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n29\n\nhaired varmint, Nick Scitorro. Mastermind of a prostitution ring based out of the local roadhouse, the Owl’s Nest, Nick hides his corrupt traffic in souls behind the seemingly innocent jitterbugging and free-flowing soda pop that attract the local teens. This unsavory menace is challenged by a crusading health commissioner, whose pitch for public education “I want to place posters all over this city telling people what to watch out for—what they’re up against,” sounds distinctly like the roadshowman who brings enlightenment to Anytown, U.S.A. But first, the health commissioner, high school teacher, newspaperman or woman must counter community ignorance, most often represented by the antediluvian, self-righteous women’s group, sketched as a bridge-playing clique of sexless battle-axes more often motivated by jealousy and snobbery than a desire to protect others’ virtue. And in between this establishment of When it proved less-than-sensational at the box office, conflict and then, resolution, is Dwain Esper’s Maniac, a hyperbolic treatise on menthe soy in exploitation’s hamtal illness, was retitled and sold as a sex film, pure and burger: the requisite scenes of simple. hedonistic jitterbugging, an often saucy musical or dance number performed at the roadhouse and oftentimes a climactic courtroom showdown between the forces of good and evil. Yet, the exploitation film—not in spite of, but because of such formulaic, technically handicapped productions—often yielded moments of sublime beauty and poetic ugliness superbly matched to the outlandish subject matter. Though a shining example of exploitation at its most incoherent and ludicrous, Dwain Esper’s Maniac also contained moments of visceral creepiness and glimpses of the kind of mental squalor and economic despair writer Michael Lesy treated in his picture book of middle-American turn-of-the-century social decay, Wisconsin Death Trip. A cult favorite for its frenzied, non sequitur storyline, Maniac is a sensational horror saga in which a mad doctor Meirschultz experiments with re-animation before his crazed assistant Maxwell takes 30\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nover his demonic practice. In Maniac (1934) a shot of a man squirming through a crawlspace is sped up to hurry his progress, resulting in a remarkable image juste, transforming the mortuary-robbing Maxwell into a skittering human cockroach navigating the darkened cavities of civilization. In The Devil’s Sleep (1949), about a “pep” pill racket at a health spa, the actor playing “Bob” (the exploitation film being notoriously unclear in identifying its cast), well beyond the age of puberty, dons v-neck sweater and what appears to be a horrendous blond pompadour wig in order to portray a gullible high-schooler, producing a hilarious, monstrous but apropos representation of adolescence at its most awkward. The makers of Highway Hell (aka Honky Tonk Girl, Going My Way, Mr.?, Hitchhike to Hell, Dir: Patrick Carlyle, D.P: J. Rey Palmer), a sordid tale of hitchhiking prostitutes, were seemingly unfamiliar with the key lighting methods of the major studios. They positioned their lamps erratically, so that at times they cast vividly expressionistic shadows behind the emotionally troubled bartender “Pop,” a moral vigilante who seems to derive his greatest joy in condemning others’ sins. Other scenes replicate stark crime scene photography, as when a surreptitious snapshot—for purposes of blackmail—is taken of two drugged teens posed in a compromising position, a hand reaching into the frame and brutally pulling the girl’s panties from the shadowy recesses of her hiked skirt and down her pale, fleshy hips (a stark, disturbing image the New York State Censor Board in 1954 demanded be removed before lifting its 13-year ban on the film). Something in the sudden, unpolished choreography of this gesture gives an element of eerie veracity to this brutal violation. Many of the exploitation cinema’s inky nighttime shots have the same grubby, polluted veneer of Weegee’s tabloid photography, intensifying the genre’s associations with squalid hyper-realism.\n\nStark love: Willis Kent’s The Wages of Sin features Willy Castello as a brutal pimp and Constance Worth as his unwilling victim. (Photofest)\n\nThe Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n31\n\nThough one would hardly call it an art film, Patrick Carlyle’s 1936 Polygamy (aka Illegal Wives), inspired by the prosecution of Short Creek, AZ polygamists, features moments of unexpected visual force.\n\n32\n\nAlso directed by Carlyle, with cinematographer Irving Akers, A.S.C., Polygamy (1936) features a startlingly effective shot in which a villainous bigamist climbs shadow-bisected stairs to greet his virgin bride, bringing to mind the expressionistic staircases and fatal wedding night in Charles Laughton’s similar story of sexual menace, The Night of the Hunter (1955), photographed by Stanley Cortez. Already well documented in Rudolph Grey’s Nightmare of Ecstasy and Tim Burton’s biopic Ed Wood (1994) are the clumsy aesthetics of Edward D. Wood, Jr., whose heartfelt, very personal treatise on cross-dressing, Glen or Glenda? (1953), was an intoxicating symphony of stock footage, stilted dialogue and budget-necessitated improvisation wed into a surprisingly pained-and-provocative whole. The major studios sought their own brand of homogenized perfection not only in the visual design of its scenery but in their cast as well. Their spotlight shone only on model specimens of youth, beauty, criminality, parental authority or whatever stereotypical figure or value was being pimped. The individuals who dotted the exploitation firmament seemed slightly flawed by comparison—in face, body or voice—wayward branches on the family tree banned from penetrating Hollywood’s pearly gates. Damned to the purgatory of bad production values, low wages, short schedules, poor scripts and erratic releasing, these humble understudies to the never attained status of “star” labored in the pariah company of others who would never escape the exploitation gulag. Occasionally in an exploitation film one might spot a recognizable character actor such as Pedro de Cordoba (Damaged Goods, 1937), Sterling Holloway (Tomorrow’s Children, 1934), Lyle Talbot (Glen or Glenda?) or Angelo Rossitto (Child Bride, 1942), but any truly famous figure appeared only after all professional bridges to Tinseltown had been reduced to ash. It was only after she had extracted all the money and publicity she could from her well-publicized divorce from John Barrymore that Elaine Barrie fired her parting shot in the tawdry instructional film How to Undress (1937, opForbidden Fruit\n\nposite one-time burlesque queen Trixie Friganza, then aged, overweight and reduced to comic relief) in which she revealed to an audience of strangers all the feminine attributes only her husband had formerly been privy to. Lita Grey Chaplin (The Devil’s Sleep) was another Hollywood ex-wife who gulped her last breath of celebrity on a Poverty Row soundstage, which also provided final stabs at fame to silent movie veterans Wheeler Oakman, Betty Compson, Lila Lee, Marceline Day, Clara Kimball Young and Francis Ford (older brother of director John Ford, in whose films he occasionally continued to appear). Having briefly shared the spotlight with Robert Mitchum following their infamous marijuana bust on August 31, 1948, aspiring starlet Lila Leeds left the lockup to find that her acting opportunities had evaporated, except for an offer made by a clever exploiteer who capitalized on her notoriety and featured her in a melodrama on the pitfalls of pot: Wild Weed (aka She Shoulda Said ‘No’!, 1949). Mitchum’s brother John also served a stint in exploitation (as a doctor in The Devil’s Sleep), his thick, cardboard demeanor perfectly suited to the two-dimensional morality picture. And the glories of Citizen Kane (1940) and Dracula (1931) were only faded clippings in a scrapbook when Ruth Warrick and Bela Lugosi made their respective appearances in One Too Many (1951) and Glen or Glenda? The stars of the exploitation film—reliable actors whose faces become familiar as one journeys through its seamy archives—never achieved more than marginal success. An actor with the charisma and good looks that somehow never carried him up and out of the exploitation racket, Timothy Farrell (Test Tube Babies [1948], The Devil’s Sleep) reached his professional zenith with a bit part as a bailiff in A Star Is Born (1954). But sometimes the most recognizable face in an exploitation film was not an actor but a familiar snippet of celluloid. Stock footage, as dependable a narrative filler as a roadhouse acrobatic act or torch song, was an oft-employed tool in the exploitation trade. However incongruous they may have been, these uncopyrighted trimmings of unknown origin were integrated into virtually every exploitation film as an inexpensive means of patching holes in a poorly filmed continuity, adding production values to a cheap picture or padding the length to reach the requisite 60 minutes. Most common are the passage-of-time shots—clocks ticking, seasons changing and calendars gliding past the camera—closely followed by sequences of roaring newspaper presses, churning out thousands of five-star finals whose headlines invariably mismatch that of the customized front page thrown into closeup to illustrate the magnitude of the marijuana menace. A squadron of police cars and motorcycles roaring into action with sirens wailing is another sequence that recurs with surprising frequency in the exploitation cinema. Generic shots of crowded metropolises serve to establish urban settings. Stock shots of lightning could either indicate inclement weather (Child Bride), the wrath of God (Because of Eve, 1948) or a character’s turbulent state of mind (Glen or Glenda?). Applied sparingly, stock footage could nicely enhance an inexpensive production, but subtlety was a concept embraced by few exploiteers, who instead pasted in as much footage as possible. Such errors in aesthetic judgment were hilariously exemplified in The Wages of Sin (1938), in which nine o’clock is signified by a closeup of a cuckooclock sounding the full nine times, followed by an uninterrupted 10 chirps to illustrate the passage of an hour. In They Must Be Told, a character’s train journey is illustrated by numerous shots of a locomotive (heading in various directions, blithely violating The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n33\n\nAdventurous teen Eve (Nell O’Day) prepares to taste the forbidden fruit that will eventually transform her into a syphilitic sex delinquent in The Road to Ruin. (Photofest)\n\nthe CHC’s laws of spatial continuity), including one gratuitous closeup of the boiler being stoked, lest one question the origin of said locomotion. Shots of telephone wires and busy operators occasionally enhanced an otherwise ho-hum phone call sequence, for no discernible reason other than an almost overcompensatory need to make oneself understood at any cost. A related shortcut was the recycling of footage from other exploitation films. Teenage (1941) featured scenes borrowed from Gambling with Souls (1936) and Slaves in Bondage (1937), while the “Introduction to Forbidden Desire” (1944) is illustrated with clips from The Road to Ruin (1933), The Wages of Sin, The Pace That Kills (1936), Mad Youth (1939) and Guilty Parents (1934), among others. One unique application of stock footage was the exploiteer’s frequent use of reels of surgical films, shockingly graphic views of the human body purloined from medical colleges and educational film houses which they not-so-neatly spliced into their own narratives. It was generally possible to find actresses willing to shed their dresses before the cameras, but photographing the birth of a baby or finding someone willing to demonstrate the grotesque physical effects of syphilis was more of a challenge. Medical supply houses, who sold such reels to educational institutions and doctors who wanted a motion picture of certain procedures, were a handy source in attaining such thrilling fare. Footage of bodies racked by venereal diseases, as well as images of natural and cesarean birth were the most popular, though resourceful filmmakers found 34\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nways to integrate other, less conventional reels (such as Dwain Esper’s use of a face-lift operation in Modern Motherhood). Generally, these pieces of found footage were cut into the narrative as films-withinthe-film, though occasionally the medical reels were meant to be a part of the story—as in the gratuitous cesarean birth which saves the child of a woman killed in a unwarranted car accident (more stock footage) in Narcotic. One of the most effective integrations of a medical reel into an exploitation narrative occurs in Edgar G. Ulmer’s Damaged Lives. A doctor takes a young husband on a tour of the long row of doors—like some game show nightmare—that comprise his V-D ward. He opens a door, the young man looks in, and we see a snippet of medical verite, of a body covered with lesions. Another door: a man blinded by syphilis. Another door: a woman crippled by syphilis. Another door: a woman who has given birth to seven “defective” children. The doctor opens another door and, before we can look inside, out steps the young man’s wife. The effect is devastating. For it is as though the wife has stepped out of—not an exam room, but—a medical reel of venereal disease victims: not the domain of actors and imagination, but of the genuinely afflicted. The severity of the characters’ predicament is made chillingly clear. Such moments of creative inspiration recur in exploitation films in spite of their technical limitations. Poorly miked sets with creaking stairs, vocal reverberations in hollow rooms and noisy props thumping against tables and walls nevertheless more accurately represented natural sound. Just as the CHC visuals were designed to unscroll before the customer’s view without disturbing the ideal dream state of passive, unthinking enjoyment, sound was also orchestrated to enhance and subtly reinforce (never running contrary to) the tone of the picture. Each second of screen time was programmed to coordinate with dialogue, stock sound effects and, of course, lushly orchestrated, narcotic melodies. The quickly, cheaply, sometimes amateurishly packaged exploitation fable neglected this cinematic ingredient more than any other, perhaps because of its invisibility and the high cost and skill involved in synchronizing sound to image. During the 1930s, the aural quality of the exploitation film was especially crude since multi-track sound technology was still rather complicated. At the majors, sound departments had ingeniously conquered many of the obstacles inherent in the clumsy mechanics, while the neophyte exploiteer struggled for mere intelligibility. In exploitation, music was never composed to fit the scene. Instead, a scene was edited and a disc of generic library music (without copyright or unionized musicians’ strings attached) was laid over it, often indelicately balanced so it drowned out much of the dialogue, before being abruptly chopped off in a psychologically discordant screech of a needle yanked off a turning record at the close of a scene. Usually, though, the story progressed without benefit of music and the hurried speech of poorly coached actors was separated by imposing gulfs of pregnant stillness—the theater was silent except for the crisp whisper of dust and scratches being pulled past the glowing beam of the projector’s optical-sound exciter lamp. These niggling technical seams in the exploitation film—like a white tag curling out from beneath a vamp’s black brassiere—anchor the exploitation experience in quotidian reality, acting as effective reminders of the difference between its gritty and true shadow world and the pristine fantasy concocted by its more prosperous siblings. A The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n35\n\nwonderful example of such a pleasantly disruptive moment occurs in the otherwise well-produced Willis Kent production Mad Youth. When an old lady hunches over to turn on a lamp in a darkened room, we hear a metallic clang as the switch of a theatrical spotlight is thrown just off-screen, providing the illumination for the small on-screen prop. Not all the exploitation films were riddled with imperfections, and not all the flaws of the afflicted are so endearing. At a glance, the films of Kroger Babb might hold their own, technically at least, alongside the typical B picture. The same higher standard is also seen in such reasonably Escort Girl might have passed for a well-made exploitation films as Damaged Goods Monogram or PRC picture, if it (aka Forbidden Desire), Tomorrow’s Children, Asweren’t for its licentious subject mat- sassin of Youth (1937) and Road to Ruin, whose ter and the “Adults Only” tag, which telltale seams have been effectively concealed. functioned as a magnet for the carAt the opposite extreme, some films buckle nally curious. beneath the double burden of lack of imagination and technical crudity. Reckless Decision (aka Suspicious Mothers, 1933), patched together under the laughable aegis of High-Art Pictures Corp., consists of a not-veryexploitive good-girl-going-wrong film (Protect Your Daughter, purchased or pirated from another producer by John Noble), padded—or yoked, one should say—with an excruciatingly static framing device of parents worrying over their own potentially wayward daughter. The framing was a lengthy sequence of poorly recorded dialogue filmed on a single minuscule set. Such disappointments, however, are easily forgotten upon the discovery of a film which brazenly violates screen convention in a manner that is original, intriguing and, by design or by accident, purely vanguard (e.g., the films of Dwain Esper, Ed Wood, moments of Edgar G. Ulmer’s Damaged Lives and, occasionally, Patrick Carlyle). It could be argued that the exploitation film is truly more cinematic than its polished Hollywood rival because the viewer is made aware of the mechanics of the film’s design, the methods of its construction, drawing the viewer in on a much deeper level by requiring that greater attention be paid to plot and character. In the realm of subject matter, exploitation held a distinct advantage over the Hollywood picture, as it was not as constrained by the guidelines of taste, having no widespread corporate image to protect. In addition to addressing topics forbidden in legitimate films, the exploitation picture often took a radically different tack in the way it depicted vice. Hollywood on occasion indulged in scenes of “forced seduction.” In the exploitation film girls were 36\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nraped. While violent sexual advances in big-budget films were depicted in expressive closeups and symbolic gestures, the exploitation film showed physical action. Even the more daring pre-Production Code films could only artfully allude to sex, as in the corn-crib rape in The Story of Temple Drake (1933). Presented in facial closeups, the rape is implied by the heroine’s face reacting with horror, and her attacker’s leering fiendishly in partial shadow as he moves toward her out of frame, followed by a generic scream. A heroine’s sexual scramble up the corporate ladder made in Baby Face (1933) is similarly implied as the camera zooms out the side of a skyscraper window and climbs higher up the structure as the heroine climbs her way to the executive suite. Reefer Madness (1936) gives an ugly vocabulary to Hollywood’s artful, expressionist ravishments as a hopped-up marijuana fiend pulls a naive teenage girl into his lap and claws madly at her dress, pulling the back open and yanking her bra straps into disarray while she struggles in resistance. Exploitation inherited much of its villain/victim design from Victorian literature and the melodramatic stage, but made its formulaic seductions more visceral through seedy production values and low-caliber performances. The awkward delivery of lines distances these films from the slick invisibility of the CHC, as do the unglamorous appearances of some of the actors. For example, in Guilty Parents the typically suave, tuxedoed cad Al (Lynton Brent) pours champagne not into the rouged lips of a frail, soft-focused, well-coifed starlet, but down the gullet of Betty Wagner (Elen Aristi), a plump, awkward girl with poor posture and blunt features. When his hand squeezes her breast she grunts wearily and nauseously, delivering an effect of genuine carnal corruption that C.B. DeMille with his lavishly audacious tableaux of modernist debauchery (e.g., Madame Satan, 1930) never equaled. Al later finds Betty passed out fully clothed in a bed and, while the stock-music jazz pumps on in the background, he stirs her into aroused consciousness. Betty later dies of a botched backroom abortion. The ugly reality denied by Hollywood, but which keeps slipping through the cracks in In this publicity photo (which resembles nothing in the exploitation, gives the genre an film), good-girl-gone-wrong Burma (Harley Wood) intoxicating quality—the mes- appears to beg for one more fix from the dope-dealing Nick in Marihuana: Weed with Roots in Hell.\n\nThe Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n37\n\nmerizing impression provided by documentary film or news photography, of an actual, arrested sliver of the past. It manifests itself in many ways, large and small, obvious and subtle. It convinces the viewer, in spite of the film’s aesthetic ungainliness, that the story is more real than make believe. Actresses with authentic regional speech patterns instead of the typical faux European dialects with which CHC leading ladies flavor their roles; actresses with shiny faces; actors with beady eyes; the visible imprints of bras and labels beneath sweaters and gowns; ill-fitting costumes; the lack of full composure (authentic hysterics, genuine passion and drunkenness); exterior scenes filmed on actual locations (complete with traffic noise and casual passersby)—are all tiny fragments of a reality that Hollywood attempted to ward off its premises like rats. Frequently the bitter truths exploiteers offered were not so minute. Though they often teased audiences and failed to live up to their promises, the exploitation film did at times reveal to the public sights that would never stain the studio’s screens: the bare breast, the flaccid penis, venereal diseases in all their suppurating, flesh-eroding glory. Had he lived to see Mom and Dad, perhaps Will Rogers would have rescinded his maxim about screen lewdness, “You can’t make a picture as bad as the ads lead you to believe it is.”7 Homespun cinema-related witticisms, it seems, don’t apply to every genre. Admittedly, most exploitation films failed to live up to their own hype, offering the public a pale semblance of the fully exposed iniquity promised in their advertisements. At best the exploitation film offered the thrill of the carnival strip show—only instead of a middle American Salomé dropping her veils, it was a wayward high school girl raising her skirt in a stocking-baring dance celebrating escape from oppressive parental eyes... a feral outburst fueled by beer and marijuana, a sudden launch into a lifestyle of strip poker, the occasional loin-cooling nocturnal swim and various other exploits resulting from the all-too-common formula of irresponsible parenting, narrow-minded teaching, quack doctors and urban hoods who roam small town and suburb for nubile women to stock their whorehouses and peddle their dope. The best way to depict a woman’s salvation from iniquity, the exploiteers repeatedly asserted, was to depict her tumble from innocence Teen revelry in Mad Youth climaxes with jitter to depravity in thorough detail. By bugging and a baton-twirling drum major. 38\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nsharing in her misfortune, serving as silent voyeur-witness to every unrolled stocking, gulp of champagne and puff of marijuana, the viewer was complicit in her downfall and would be better warned of the seductive power wielded by these vices that threaten the well-being of every young man and woman. Absent from these instructional narratives, however, was any dramatization of a healthy sexual relationship, so that the flashes of flesh hungrily anticipated by the zealous viewer were usually “degenerate” in nature. The possibility of a sound, upstanding relationship hinted at in the quaintly titled Mom and Dad was An innovative doctor (who in one scene removes nullified by shocking closeups of a baby from a dead woman’s womb) experiences male and female genitalia corroded a sexual downfall—losing a virtuous wife and conwith syphilis, or the unnatural image sorting with skid-row whores—when he of a vagina shrouded in white sheets becomes addicted to opium in Narcotic. and surrounded by surgical technicians from which a baby appears. On those rare occasions when sexual representation wasn’t associated with moral and physical decay, it was usually without purpose or meaning of any kind. If it couldn’t be logically worked into the narrative, exposed flesh would be brought on-screen with little rhyme or reason. Women disrobing for doctors’ examinations provided audiences the opportunity to steal glimpses of the verboten female form in Maniac, Race Suicide (aka Victims of Passion, 1937) and Test Tube Babies (the medical realm as setting for sexual display is discussed at greater length in Chapter Eight, “Soft Core and Hard Sell”). In Marihuana, giggling schoolgirls jiggle into the surf on a weed-induced lark, while a swimming pool is the site for a nocturnal mass baptism into depravity in Road to Ruin. A catfight allows the stripping away of garments in Test Tube Babies, strip poker in Mad Youth and strip craps in Road to Ruin. In Guilty Parents an initiation into a gang of reckless teenagers forces new female recruits to undress to the jeering savagery of the “gang.” In The Devil’s Sleep a health-minded woman’s casual entry into a sauna is the setting for delivery of “the goods.” In Child Bride, the prepubescent protagonist (Shirley Mills, who had portrayed little Ruth Joad in The Grapes of Wrath two years earlier) communes with nature and her dog in a daytime swim without the proper apparel, leaving the male viewer to instinctively steal what glimpses he could and wrestle with his conscience at a later time. When no legitimate excuse to strip the starlets could be extracted from the narrative, producers had the women disrobe for no reason whatsoever. The need to show women in casual undress instigated a profusion of dialogue scenes set in women’s boudoirs and backstage dressing rooms. In Escort Girl (1941), a group of women in The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n39\n\nminimal costuming chat about their customers while filing nails and rouging lips. Such a scene of gratuitous exposure is included in Maniac, including a woman casually exposed in a tub of suds and another vigorously and lasciviously shaken by a reducing belt. Test Tube Babies stages a husband and wife tête-à-tête at the kitchen table, with the camera placed close enough to take full advantage of the sheer negligee worn by the Mrs. Reefer Madness illustrates how such crude devices became oddly lyrical in the exploitation film. The steadily advancing narrative is momentarily frozen for a voyeuristic vignette in the bedroom of a female dope peddler dressing for another day’s work. All attention is suddenly focused on the hushed spectacle of a leg protruding from a parted robe, a stocking nonchalantly tugged into place on a thigh, forming a sequence somehow as eloquent as it is unnecessary, a stolen moment quickly eradicated by whirling tides of jazz and hard-boiled dialogue that rush back in and hurry the plot on its way. Other scenes of undress were less eloquent. In Child Bride, a self-explanatory yarn about the backwoods custom of children marrying their elders, an impoverished woman is shown in a state of extreme décolletage as she defends herself against an abusive husband. The schoolteacher trying to improve the mountain people’s living conditions is tied up and stripped by angry hillbillies in a lurid scene of country versus city, foretelling such mainstream and exploitation hits as Deliverance (1972), The Hills Have Eyes (1977) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). It is a raving lunatic who rips the gown from the body of a woman (actually a reanimated corpse) in Maniac. Viewers of Lash of the Penitentes (1936) saw perhaps the genre’s most gruesome instance of sadism, as a woman hanging by her wrists has her bare chest flogged with a whip. Among the few instances in which flesh was exhibited without moral condemnation were nudist features such as Elysia (1934) and Unashamed (1938), which preached the message of physical rejuvenation through full solar exposure. Unfortunately, the only way these films could skirt the authorities was by clinging to their sermons, which meant characters were forbidden to sexually interact with one another or even embrace in a way that might cause the flesh of one to rub the flesh of another in a suggestive manner. After half an hour of Unashamed, one stops noticing the bared breasts and buttocks and is merely bored by the stale romantic plot in which a woman converts a man to nudism, only to have him stolen away by another. Her only recourse is to leap, still naked, to her death from a craggy peak in melodramatic desperation. The only consistency in the corporal exposure is that—with rare exception—the body which is bared in the name of science, sermonizing or raw entertainment is female.\n\n40\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nChapter Two IN THE BEGINNING Pinpointing the precise moment at which the motion picture was born is an impossible task, simply because the cinema was more the product of evolution than spontaneous creation. But wherever one opts to posit the big bang that spawned the cinematic universe, its genesis also marks the beginning of exploitation. Film history is also exploitation’s history, for the two are congenitally joined. Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope is often considered the seed from which the cinema sprouted, though its images were not projected for a mass audience but cycled within a wooden cabinet into which the individual viewer peered. Woodville, Otway and Gray Latham’s eidoloscope was the first American invention to spread dancing photographs above the astounded gazes of a communal audience. Although prior to the Lathams’ and even Edison’s contraptions there was the zoopraxiscope of photographer Eadweard Muybridge, its significance is qualified by the fact that it projected not photographs but transparent paintings on spinning glass discs, akin to the magic lantern shows popular in music halls at the time (some of which were quite elaborate, incorporating movement, color, intertitles and music). As inventors boldly appropriated, or downright stole, ideas from one another, there evolved a series of highly touted contraptions christened with names of jumbled Greek and Latin: phantascopes, zooscopes, cineographs, animatiographes, cinographoscopes, vitascopes and vitagraphs. The invention of these motion picture apparati was not the birth of cinema. The metamorphosing machines over which visionary men labored were only attempts to harness “cinema,” an ethereal phenomenon with which they were truly obsessed—some kind of indefinable quality of which they knew little, except that riches awaited the first to lay claim to it. The entrepreneurial endeavor would climax when, in a crowded music hall or rented storefront, the crank of another mechanism would be turned and the cinematic essence would be unharnessed from the coils of film onto which it had been temporarily imprisoned. When the swirls of gray shadow were finally thrown onto a reflective sheet to the amazement of the Victorian audience, art was not born. Exploitation was. Poised behind the charismatic genius of all the Edisons, Lathams, Muybridges, Dicksons, Smiths and Blacktons was a common dream of the pot of gold awaiting the man whose patent was superior to the rest. Cinema was not born of high ideals but ferocious conniving, and it was men (and, in time, women) such as these who, a few short decades later, would constitute the motion picture genre known as exploitation. As it would be half a century later, piracy was rampant in the first decades of cinema, as filmmakers very literally remade the popular films of their competitors, when not laying their hands on a rival picture, cutting on fresh titles and selling it as their own. Unlike their forebears, however, the exploiteers would be neither praised nor respected for their contributions, only despised and feared. Because while the cinema at large has grown sophisticated, cloaking its crass money-making objectives in the gilt vest of aesthetics, these individuals have not. The exploiteers remained true to the The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n41\n\ntradition of the men who brought the motion picture into being. In their novelty and lurid charms, exploitation films were true to the spirit of the dancing shadows that first astounded a naive America some 40 years previously. Many of the pioneer filmmakers who sought their fortunes in this new profession invoked the pretense of scientific innovation. It must have been with a smile of satisfaction that Muybridge (née Edward Muggeridge) tallied his evening’s receipts from an exhibition of “photographic representations of animal locomotion,” thinking back on the hush that Even the earliest films bear the imprint of exploitation. For fell over the hundreds of example, Après le Bal - le Tub (1897, Georges Méliès) highbrows in the lecture audience as the zoopraxiscope ceased its concentration on camels, elephants and horses and began emitting images of men and women in movement, their nakedness cloaked only in Darwinian theory as they walked, climbed stairs, danced. The stunned, reverent silence of the audience was inevitably broken by thunderous applause which snapped the viewers out of their brief reverie and returned their minds to the extraordinary contributions of the images’ ingenious “creator.” But Muybridge’s fixation on locomotive nudity was no anomaly in the cinema’s infancy. Throughout these early years, technical innovation and taboo were inextricably linked. The latter ensured the popular success of the former, which in turn earned such widespread renown that the coarse substance of its being was legitimized in the name of scientific endeavor. Not every pioneer exploited the lure of the carnal to advance their inventions. In 1896 France, Auguste and Louis Lumière developed a contraption of their own, the portable and versatile Cinématographe. With it they recorded subtly staged scenes of everyday life, or “actualités”: children at play, laborers hard at work, families in repose and wonderfully scenic vistas that the urbanite might never otherwise have the opportunity to behold. In America, where the competition was more fierce, another impulse was at work, as filmmakers opted to focus their lenses on vistas of an entirely different sort. The working-class clientele would only drop so many nickels into the slot to see trains 42\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\npulling into a station or inert views of faraway lands, however exquisitely framed. Rather than an extension of the respectable dramatic stage, early cinema was more a creation of the industrial age. Its poetry was not bound in leather or rimmed in gold, it was wound onto battered metal reels with sharp edges, stacked into greasy cans and wedged into splintery wooden crates. Annabelle Whitford’s Serpentine Dances, one of the earliest performances to be captured for posterity by the lens of Edison’s kinetograph, had previously been performed not in the perfumed air of the European ballet theaters, but within the stale-beer-and-cigar-smoke stench of the American music hall. In addition to the beguiling dances of Annabelle (and a host of anonymous impersonators), audiences enjoyed the theatrics of cockfights, the muscular bare Early cinema advertisement c. 1900. torso of Eugene Sandow and comedic vignettes of a decidedly racist tone (Dancing Darkies [1896, Biograph] and Watermelon Contest [1896, Edison] to name but two). The very first films turned out by the forefathers of the American cinema were not the whimsical novelties they are often blindly dismissed as, but shockingly frank moving tableaux intended to gratify the eyes of an adult male viewership, the sporting gentleman in particular. A Windy Corner (1898, Biograph) is a prelude to The Seven Year Itch, as a woman’s dress billows up while she stands over a ventilation grate. An 1895 New York newspaper article reported the debut of the Lathams’ eidoloscope: You’ll sit comfortably and see fighters hammering each other, circuses, suicides, hangings, electrocutions, shipwrecks, scenes on the exchanges, street scenes, horse-races, football games, almost anything, in fact, in which there is action, just as if you were on the spot during the actual events. 1 The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n43\n\nProminent among the initial subjects of Muybridge’s serial photography were nude women, boxing men, horses and dogs (two of God’s creatures especially beloved by bettors). The first film ever released by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company (later to foster the talents of D.W. Griffith) was Sparring Contest at Canastoda (1895), serialized in four segments. Illegal “blood sports” such as prizefights, bullfights, cockfights and rat-baiting (in which men wagered on how many vermin a fox terrier could kill in an enclosed arena within a certain time limit) were popular cinematic subjects in the latter years of the 19th-century, calling for a great deal of tact on the part of their promoters lest the exhibitor fall prey to forces of reform which had already targeted this new, vulgar sensation. The newborn medium was hardly an unsightly blemish appearing suddenly on the ivory epidermis of American society. There were already places to be visited and publications to be read by men who sought certain unsanctioned pleasures. The cinema’s predecessor, with its seemingly unbridled concentration on lowbrow subjects, was the National First adapted to the screen by producer Sigmund Police Gazette, a weekly New York Lubin in 1903, Timothy Shay Arthur’s tempertabloid (est. 1845) that catered to the ance novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room would return to the screen in 1931 via exploitation proworldly male. In the 1890s, the tabducer Willis Kent. loids primary ingredients were sports (especially boxing and bettors’ games), sex (primarily music hall dancing girls not unlike Annabelle) and crime (sparing no detail in describing its performance and punishment), and it frequently featured stories made up of combinations thereof. Many early motion pictures—especially the Edison shorts which embraced carnal interests more wholeheartedly than other pioneers’—were merely Police Gazette stories transferred onto filmstock. Pillow fights in boarding schools were frequently the subject of Police Gazette woodcuts (e.g., October 26, 1895) and were later brought to life on film in Seminary Girls (1897, Edison). The exploits of artists’ models and 44\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nwomen who take up arms against one another were also sources of great fascination to both the reading and viewing public of the day (e.g., Fate of the Artist’s Model 1-5 [1903, Biograph] and the stripping, then dueling, femmes of An Affair of Honor [1897, Biograph]). 2 On July 19, 1895, tabloid and cinema were sublimely united when the grapplings of wrestlers Duncan C. Ross, Harry Dunn and Ernest Roeber were captured by the eidoloscope’s lens on the roof of the Police Gazette building. Before it became “The Leading Illustrated Sporting Journal in the World,” crime and political corruption were the central focus of the Police Gazette, which brazenly exposed the misdeeds of New York (organized and random) as well as the names of the people who perpetrated them. When the publication was sold to Richard K. Fox in 1876, the genuinely brave and noble ambitions of its founders, George Wilkes and Enoch Camp, gave way to pure sensationalism as the Police Gazette threw its weight upon an axiom of yellow journalism that would become one of the fundamental principles of the exploitation cinema: Any subject, no matter how gruesome or salacious, could be brought to the public if properly cloaked in the guise of moral enlightenment. This idea was quickly absorbed by the early filmmakers. Thus could the Edison Manufacturing Company in 1901 proudly bring to the screen its (staged) filmic account of the fate of the man who assassinated William McKinley: Panoramic View of Auburn State Prison; Where LEON CZOLGOSZ was taken after his sentence, and kept until the day of his EXECUTION. The door leading to the DEATH CELL. Taking Czolgosz to the EXECUTION ROOM. Testing electric chair with lamps. Arrival of Czolgosz. He stumbles as he comes to the chair. This was his only faulter (sic). Received 3 SHOCKS OF 18,000 VOLTS and is pronounced dead by the doctors. 3 Apparently struggling under the burdensome compulsion to warn the general public of the wages of sin, early filmmakers made such enlightening works as Execution of a Spy (1902, Biograph), Execution of the Spanish Spy (1898, Lubin), Beheading a Chinese Prisoner (1900, Lubin), Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895, Edison) and, lest the animal kingdom feel exempt from the wages of sin, Electrocuting an Elephant (1903, Edison, not a reenactment). In France, Georges Méliès offered a frank examination of world history, highlighted by reenactments of tortures and executions, in La Civilisation a travers les ages (Civilization Through the Ages, 1907), also distributed under the title The History of Human Atrocities, a fitting title for an early-century exploitation documentary. Before the end of the first decade of the 20th century, the flimsy veil of scientific advancement and moral edification was moth-eaten and worn thin and filmmakers sought to rejuvenate the earning potential of their films by somehow heightening their potency. The public was willing to accept longer films, and films of greater narrative complexity. Thus the libidinal impulse that was once relieved through unveiled depictions of vice and carnality was channeled with a vengeance into more socially acceptable directions, namely melodrama—for well-crafted melodrama tempered the sting of purely carnal sensationalism. The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n45\n\nThe carnally minded filmmaker unleashed his or her dark impulses in wildly exaggerated stories of intensified romance, subhuman villainy, ferocious violence and glorified martyrdom, all neatly packaged in a standardized visual style formulated to rip emotional responses from the hearts of its viewers, protected from too much criticism by its separation from reality. These stories, which usually justified their vulgar means with a morally enlightening end, were mere entertainment... harmless... purely imaginary. The American Vitagraph Company led the way. Film historian Charles Musser writes of their 1906 release The Automobile Thieves: During the course of the 985-foot, 23-shot drama, the thieves—an attractive young couple—commit a string of holdups and robberies. They are indifferent to the fate of their victims, who are often beaten or shot. They manage to escape a police trap, largely because of the fearless intervention of the woman, but the ensuing chase ends in a shoot-out and the death of the couple. At the conclusion, the dying man staggers to his beloved, kisses her, and dies. (In fact, his actions throughout appear based on sexual obsession, and his periodic sense of guilt is assuaged by alcohol). 4 A stream of similar films capitalized on the success of The Automobile Thieves, each discreetly testing the limits of social acceptance, eventually overburdening the market with the morose and incurring the wrath of Progressive-era activists who launched an all-out attack on the cinematic enterprise, which had grown to such an extent that it could be fairly referred to as an industry. The aggressive reform groups targeted the cinema as both a medium of entertainment and a place where society’s dregs could congregate. The storefront theaters were nothing more than incubators of iniquity, where—in the musty-smelling darkness—vulgar images nurtured impure thoughts into full-fledged immorality. One Chicago judge in 1907 wrote, “These theaters cause, indirectly or directly, more juvenile crime coming into my court than all other causes combined,” citing as partial causes such films as Beware, My Husband Comes, The Bigamist, Gaieties of Divorce, Child Robbers and Paris Slums. 5 As censorship pressure intensified, the blood-and-flesh cinema of the turn of the century was shrewdly reshaped into something more palatable. Even that pioneering purveyor of the abject, Thomas Edison, acknowledged in 1907 the necessity of assimilation, quoted in the trade magazine Moving Picture World as saying, “In my opinion, nothing is of greater importance to the success of the motion picture interests than films of good moral tone.” 6 The long-term survival of this potentially lucrative technical novelty depended on its respectability. Prurient spectacle could still be the cinema’s raison d’etre but the only way it could gain a proper foothold in the burgeoning American popular culture industry would be by making itself suitable for mixed-sex audiences of disparate age groups. True visionaries of the day had even higher aspirations. They sought the longterm profits of immortality, and knew such things were within reach if they could only confer on their merchandise the noble designation of “art.” 46\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nImmense factories were designed to improve the appearance of the motion pictures. And dank storefront nickelodeons gave way to ornate palaces where even the most vulgar dancing shadows were enshrined, then elevated and, in a matter of time, vindicated. The rising stature of the moving picture was not only the work of the jodhpur-and-beretwearing director (already designated the paramount artiste of the medium) but was as much the result of lesser known craftspersons: the press agents and publicity photographers whose work was not evidenced on screen, but who were just as influA quickly produced imitation of Traffic in Souls, The Inside of ential in shaping the the White Slave Traffic—like all good exploitation films—jusway the public pertified its prurient content with the credentials of various pubceived the films, differlic health groups. entiating as best they could the formulaic product that was shipped out of the industrious studios with metronomic regularity. But the veil of art was only so thick. No matter how respectable the cinema became, there remained embedded within it an impulse to embrace all that was forbidden, repressed and ignored in its society—like a tainted gene that cannot be extricated from an otherwise wholesome chromosome. The delinquent impulse toward the abject would not always reveal itself in the celluloid offspring. Some films (bred in a genteel environment) might be healthy in outlook, while others would exhibit only marginal symptoms of genetic corruption. Every generation, however, produced a few microcephalic spawn, which (be they films or humans) would generally be grouped together, cast aside, ignored and, if at all possible, forgotten. Temporarily suppressed, the deviant impulse awaited its chance to reappear, which occurred almost immediately. Perhaps the bloody side of the cinema would have politely allowed itself to be assimilated into the socially acceptable mainstream were it The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film\n\n47\n\nA pair of New York cops save a woman from a life of prostitution in the influential 1913 film Traffic in Souls.\n\nnot for the well-intentioned actions of its innovator, Thomas Edison. In doing his share of rubbing away the cinema’s unsightly tarnish, he involved numerous welfare organizations in the making of special films of moral enlightenment, focusing on such popular issues as the exploitation of child labor (Suffer Little Children... For of Such Is the Kingdom of Labor, 1909), unsanitary living conditions (The Awakening of John Bond, 1911) and the fight against tuberculosis and other diseases (The Red Cross Seal, 1910). Other production companies followed suit and through such noble cinematic efforts, the aberrant cinema again made its way into the movie houses of America—a Trojan horse rolled into theater lobbies in the name of the very reformists who had sought its exile. Inspired by the social problem dramas then popular on the American stage, these films pursued topics that had been sternly forbidden by the newly founded state censor boards and the National Board of Censorship of Motion Pictures (in 1915, more congenially renamed the National Board of Review), only now they did so in the name of universal health and righteous living. Among the first and most successful of these salacious social conscience films was George Loane Tucker’s Traffic in Souls (1913), which was purportedly based on findings of “the John D. Rockefeller White Slavery Report and on the investigation of the Vice Trust by District Attorney Whitman.” Among the most effective films of its day—combining a fresh cinematic naturalism with stagy melodrama—Traffic in Souls offered a taste of what would soon be delivered in the exploitation film. It was the first feature film released by Universal and was a resounding success (Carl Laemmle’s skepticism smashed by reports of a mobbed box office in New York), due partly to the hyperbolic promotion that surrounded its release. Rockefeller later denied his participation in the film’s production but the blow had been struck. A precedent had been established for all studios, writers and directors who 48\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nsought to profit from life’s seamier side. Because of the urgency of their messages, these films transcended mere entertainment and deserved to be above judgment by those who grade"
