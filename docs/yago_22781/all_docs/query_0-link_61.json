        "text": "Happy 53rd Anniversary to King Constantine and Queen Anne Marie of Greece, who got married on this day in 1964! Princess Anne Marie of Denmark was just 13 when she met the then Crown Prince of Greece. Two years later, the couple had fallen in love and gotten engaged, marrying just weeks after her 18th Birthday and a few months after his accession to the throne. The couple have five children and ruled Greece for only three years before spending over 40 years in exile. Recently, the King and Queen have returned to Greece, where they reside in a villa in Porto Heli. In honour of their Anniversary, we are featuring their wedding below-\n\nIn the days leading up to the Wedding, there was a Farewell Dinner and a Gala in Copenhagen, as well as a Pre-Wedding Dinner in Athens, and the spectacular Wedding Ball at the Royal Palace of Athens, with Royal Guests and Relatives from around Europe.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe next day, King Constantine rode with his mother, Queen Frederica, while Princess Anne Marie arrived with her father, King Frederick.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe wedding ceremony took place at the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Annunciation in Athens, and was performed by Archbishop Chrysostomos, the Primate of Greece.\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images\n\nPart of the ceremony involved crowns being held over the heads of the couple, first by Queen Frederica, and then by Crown Prince Harald of Norway, Crown Prince Carl Gustaf of Sweden, The Prince of Wales, Prince Michael of Greece, Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia, Prince Ingolf of Denmark, Prince Michael of Kent, Prince Karl of Hesse and Count Michael Bernadotte.
