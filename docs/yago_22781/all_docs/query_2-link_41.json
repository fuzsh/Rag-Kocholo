        "text": "Constantine remained in exile for forty years after the vote in favour of the republic. He was firmly discouraged from returning to his home country, guidance he followed until February 1981 — when he returned for the funeral of his mother, Queen Frederica. The government allowed him to return for only a few hours.\n\nIn the years that followed, Constantine was embroiled in legal disputes with the Greek state. Deprived of his nationality and property in 1994, the former king filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights to recover them. Then, in 2002, Greece was ordered to pay more than €13 million (£8 million) to the royal family as monetary compensation for the lost property.\n\nConstantine and his wife Anne-Marie lived in London for several years, bringing up their five children at their home in Hampstead. It was there that the couple socialised with members of high society, including Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales. The former king was made godfather to the Prince and Princess of Wales’ first son, Prince William.\n\nIn 2013, 49 years after they initially fled Greece, Constantine and Anne-Marie returned permanently to their country. “All Greeks who live in exile want to return. It's in their blood,” he said at the time to the magazine Town & Country."
