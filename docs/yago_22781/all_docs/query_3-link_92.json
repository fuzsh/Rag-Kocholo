        "text": "Flohr completed the look with the antique corsage tiara that belongs to Queen Anne-Marie, the blog post added.\n\nThe tiara has a fascinating history. Queen Ingrid of Denmark had the tiara made from a set of brooches that she inherited from her grandmother, Queen Victoria of Sweden, according to the royal fashion blog Tiara Mania.\n\nIt was given to the then-Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark on her 18th birthday in 1964, the blog post added.\n\nAnne-Marie, who became Queen of Greece upon her marriage to King Constantine II later that year, has allowed royal brides to borrow it over the years. It was most recently worn by Crown Princess Marie-Chantal at her royal wedding to Crown Prince Pavlos in 1995, and Princess Tatiana at her wedding to Prince Nikolaos in 2010, according to Tiara Mania.\n\nThe Greek royal family were in attendance at Nina and Philippos' wedding on Saturday."
