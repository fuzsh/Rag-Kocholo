        "text": "Constantine II (born June 2, 1940, Psikhikó, near Athens, Greece—died January 10, 2023, Athens, Greece) was the king of Greece from 1964 to 1974.\n\nAfter spending World War II in exile in South Africa, Constantine returned to Greece in 1946. When his father became King Paul I in 1947, Constantine became crown prince; he succeeded to the throne upon his father’s death on March 6, 1964. Fearing leftist infiltration of the army, he dismissed Premier Georgios Papandreou in July 1965 and appointed interim premiers until April 21, 1967, when a military coup forestalled the election he was planning for May of that year. He attempted a countercoup from northern Greece on December 13, 1967, but had few sympathizers and almost immediately fled to Rome with his family. The military regime retained control of the monarchy and appointed a regent in Constantine’s place, granting the king a free return if he so desired.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
