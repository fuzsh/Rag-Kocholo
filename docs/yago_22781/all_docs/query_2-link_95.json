        "text": "The new “It” couple first sparked dating rumours on Friday after they were spotted taking a romantic stroll in New York City. News of their romance comes mere months after Nader, 27, split from her husband of four years, Billy Haire, in May, as per British media.\n\nSince the Greek monarchy was abolished in 1973 after a referendum ruled overwhelmingly in favour of a republic, Alexios’ royal status may only be titular. He does, however, know how to live like a royal.\n\nFrom lavish holidays and expensive birthdays, to romancing the hottest socialites, here’s everything we know about Prince Constantine-Alexios.\n\nPrince William of Wales is Prince Constantine-Alexios’ godfather\n\nPrince Constantine-Alexios’ grandfather, the late King Constantine II, is a close friend and second cousin of King Charles – he is also Prince William’s godfather.\n\nPrince Constantine-Alexios graduated from the prestigious Wellington College\n\nWellington College in Berkshire has produced alumni such as George Orwell and racing driver James Hunt. The fees start at £11,920 (US$15,200) for day pupils.\n\nFollowing in his father’s footsteps, Constantine graduated from Georgetown University, Washington DC, in 2022.\n\nHe had an 18th birthday like no other\n\nConstantine celebrated his 18th birthday as not many teenagers could, with a Day of the Dead themed party at Albert’s private members club in Chelsea. Membership at Albert’s costs a princely £650 per annum, plus a £250 joining fee. Alexios wore a bespoke Joshua Kane jacket to the party.\n\nJudging by his mother’s Instagram page, it looks like he received a pretty special 18th birthday present – she posted a picture of him in a new luxury car.\n\nRoyal birthdays are always well-attended. At their sister’s 21st, Constantine and Achileas managed to steal a kiss from celebrity heiress Paris Hilton.\n\nHe used to date Poppy Delevingne\n\nThe pair were seen holidaying in Ibiza and Poppy even shared Instagram posts of her holidaying with Constantine’s family in Greece. Unfortunately the romance was short-lived, although Poppy and Princess Maria-Olympia remain good friends."
