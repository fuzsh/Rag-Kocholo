        "text": "Soon after the birth of the then Prince Constantine (2 June 1940), the Royal Family left Athens to take refuge on the island of Crete following the invasion of Greece by Nazi Germany. Since the family were at risk of being captured by German forces, King George II ordered his brother – and heir to the throne – Paul to seek sanctuary in Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe family of Prince Constantine subsequently left Alexandria for Cape Town, South Africa, where they lived under the protection of the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Christian Smuts. His younger sister, Princess Irene, was born in South Africa on 11 May 1942.\n\nThe 1946 referendum restored King George II to the throne, and the family of Prince Constantine returned to Greece.\n\nFollowing the death of King George II in 1947, the Greek throne passed to Prince Constantine’s father, King Paul I. Now the heir apparent, Crown Prince Constantine attended the funeral of his uncle, King George II, holding his father by the hand during the funeral procession.\n\nFrom 1949, Crown Prince Constantine was a pupil at the National Anavryta School in Athens, an institution founded on the educational principles developed by Kurt Hahn. He has spoken of just how much he enjoyed the camaraderie of boarding school and his interactions with the other children, forging lifelong ties of friendship.\n\nWhile still a pupil at Anavryta, he also undertook military training each weekend, and – once he had completed his school studies – went on to train at three military academies (those of the Hellenic Army, Navy, and Air Force). On turning 18, as the only son of the reigning King and Queen, he swore allegiance to all three branches of the Hellenic Armed Forces.\n\nIn 1960, he commenced his studies at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Law School. During his student years, he also took part in numerous official engagements, accompanying his parents – King Paul I and Queen Frederica – on state visits to Italy, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, and Thailand.\n\nKing Paul I died on 6 March 1964 and was succeeded by his son and heir apparent, Crown Prince Constantine, who was crowned Constantine II, King of the Hellenes, at the age of 24.\n\nLater that same year, he married Princess Anne-Marie, the youngest daughter of King Frederik IX of Denmark, whom he had first met in 1959 – while still the Crown Prince – on a stop made in Copenhagen during a visit to Sweden and Norway. He proposed during a sailing holiday they took together in Norway, and the royal couple were married in Athens on 18 September 1964.\n\nTheir first child, Princess Alexia, was born on 10 July 1965 at the Mon Repos Villa on the island of Corfu – the residence where Prince Philip of Greece, the Duke of Edinburgh was also born in 1921. Crown Prince Pavlos was born on 20 May 1967, Prince Nikolaos on 1 October 1969, Princess Theodora on 9 June 1983, and Prince Philippos on 26 April 1986.\n\nOn acceding to the throne, ΗΜ King Constantine II found himself facing a complex and challenging domestic political situation in Greece. His profound differences of opinion with the then Prime Minister George Papandreou led to the resignation of the government on 15 July 1965. There followed a period of intense political turmoil that eventually led to a military coup d’état on 21 April 1967.\n\nThough beset by intense and conflicting pressures, the prime concern of His Majesty was always the safety of the Greek people. On a state visit to the United States of America, he declared: “This is not my government. The 21st of April was the worst day of my life.”\n\nIn December 1967, ΗΜ King Constantine II flew to the city of Kavala in northern Greece, where he led a counter-coup – an attempt to overthrow the Greek junta and restore democracy. He soon realised, however, that any further action might result in bloodshed and so took the decision to leave with his family for Rome, of his own accord.\n\nDuring his stay in Rome, the King received frequent requests asking for his return to Greece, which he refused to do unless democracy was first restored.\n\nIn 1973, the leader of the military junta Georgios Papadopoulos formally deposed King Constantine II to establish Greece as a non-monarchical regime.\n\nIn 1981, ΗΜ King Constantine II returned to Greece with his family for the first time since 1967, though only for a few hours, in order to attend the funeral of his mother, Queen Frederica, who had died suddenly in Madrid of a heart attack. Though security forces were posted around the Royal Estate at Tatoi to stop the public from attending the funeral, crowds in their thousands still managed to gather in the pine forest that covers Paleocastro Hill in order to greet the family and pay their last respects to the Queen.\n\nΗΜ King Constantine II returned to Greece once more in 1993, this time on a private visit with his family lasting two weeks.\n\nIn 2013, Their Majesties King Constantine II & Queen Anne-Marie returned to permanently reside in Greece.\n\nΗΜ King Constantine II died on 10 January 2023, a few days after being admitted to the Hygeia Hospital in Athens. His entire beloved family were by his side when he passed.\n\nΗΜ King Constantine II was buried privately, and not accorded those honours reserved for a head of state on the decision of the Greek government. He was laid to rest in the Royal Cemetery at Tatoi.\n\nThe funeral of ΗΜ King Constantine II was held on Monday, 16 January 2023 at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens, after his body lay in repose for some hours inside the nearby Chapel of Saint Eleftherios, open to public viewing.\n\nCrowds flocked to the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens from the early hours to pay their respects to the last King of the Hellenes. The public also lined the streets down which the motorcade transferring his body to Tatoi passed. The event drew extensive coverage in both the Greek and international media.\n\nThe ceremony was officiated by His Beatitude Hieronymos II, the Archbishop of Athens and All Greece, in the presence of all twelve Metropolitan Bishops of the Holy Synod. Also in attendance at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens were seven heads of state, the representatives of royal houses, and close friends of the family.\n\nThe Greek government was represented by its Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Panagiotis Pikrammenos, and by its Minister of Culture and Sports, Ms. Lina Mendoni.\n\nThe funeral ceremony ended with a moving eulogy delivered by a devastated Crown Prince Pavlos, honouring his father’s memory.\n\nOnce the ceremony was complete, the funeral procession left the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens for the Royal Cemetery at Tatoi. The body of ΗΜ King Constantine II was first taken to the Chapel of the Resurrection on the estate, where Orthodox Trisagion [“thrice holy”] Prayers were chanted in his memory, before being borne to the Royal Cemetery, where the King was laid to rest beside his parents."
