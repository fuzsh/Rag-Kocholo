        "text": "1964 Royal wedding\n\nWedding of Constantine II and Princess Anne-MarieDate18 September 1964VenueMetropolitan Cathedral of AthensLocationAthens, Kingdom of GreeceParticipantsConstantine II of Greece\n\nPrincess Anne-Marie of Denmark\n\nThe wedding of Constantine II, King of the Hellenes, and Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark took place on Friday, 18 September 1964, at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens.\n\nConstantine II was the reigning Greek monarch, while Princess Anne-Marie was the youngest daughter of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark. It was the second, and to date, the last wedding of a reigning Greek monarch, and the first to be held in Greece.[1]\n\nChrysostomos II, Archbishop of Athens and All Greece, presided over the Church of Greece ceremony. The ceremony was attended by the bride's and groom's families, as well as members of foreign royal families, diplomats, and various Greek and Danish officials.\n\nEngagement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe couple, third cousins through both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and King Christian IX of Denmark, first met in 1959 when then Crown Prince Constantine accompanied his parents on a state visit to Denmark. Princess Anne-Marie was just 13 at the time. They met again in 1961, and in 1962, Anne-Marie was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Constantine's older sister, Princess Sophia, to Infante Juan Carlos of Spain. In 1962, Princess Anne-Marie was on holiday with her governess in Norway, where Crown Prince Constantine was attending a yacht racing event. He proposed and she accepted. King Frederik IX initially withheld his consent, as Anne-Marie was only 15 at the time, but eventually relented on the conditions that she finish her education and the wedding not be held before her 18th birthday.[1]\n\nOn 23 January 1963, the Danish royal court announced the engagement. The wedding was initially set for January 1965. Following the death of Constantine's father, King Paul, on 6 March 1964, the date was moved forward to 18 September 1964.[2]\n\nPre-wedding celebrations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Denmark\n\n[edit]\n\nThe celebrations began in early September 1964. On 7 September, Constantine arrived in Denmark where a private dinner was held at Fredensborg Palace. The next day, there was a gala performance at the Royal Danish Theatre followed by a banquet at Christiansborg Palace. The next morning, a reception was held at Copenhagen City Hall.[2]\n\nIn Greece\n\n[edit]\n\nKing Constantine II, Princess Anne-Marie, King Frederik IX, Queen Ingrid, Princess Margrethe and Princess Benedikte sailed to Greece on board the Danish royal yacht Dannebrog. A reception was held in honour of the Danish royal family at the Hotel Grande Bretagne.\n\nOn 16 September, most of the royal guests arrived in Greece by plane. That evening, a gala was held at the Royal Palace for 1,600 invited guests.[3]\n\nWedding\n\n[edit]\n\nConstantine and Anne-Marie were married on 18 September 1964, two weeks after Anne-Marie's 18th birthday.[4]\n\nCeremony\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Greek Orthodox marriage ceremony took place in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, and was conducted by Chrysostomos II, Archbishop of Athens and All Greece.[3]\n\nAttire\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincess Anne-Marie wore a relatively unadorned gown by Danish designer Holger Blom, assisted by Jørgen Bender.[5] Her Irish lace veil, worn by her maternal grandmother, Princess Margaret of Connaught at her wedding in 1905, was anchored by a Cartier diamond tiara given to Princess Margaret by the Abbas II, Khedive of Egypt. The veil had also been worn by her mother, Queen Ingrid, in 1935. The veil and tiara together have been worn by all of Ingrid's female descendants.[6][3]\n\nKing Constantine II wore the ceremonial uniform of stratarches (field marshal) of the Hellenic Army. He wore the insignia of the Greek Order of the Redeemer, Order of Saints George and Constantine, Order of George I and the Commemorative Badge of the Centenary of the Royal House of Greece, as well as with the insignia of the Danish Order of the Elephant and Order of the Dannebrog.[6]\n\nWedding party\n\n[edit]\n\nBridesmaids\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincess Anne of the United Kingdom\n\nPrincess Christina of Sweden\n\nPrincess Irene of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrincess Margareta of Romania\n\nPrincess Clarissa of Hesse-Kassel\n\nPrincess Tatiana Radziwiłł\n\nCrown bearers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Crown Prince of Norway[7]\n\nThe Crown Prince of Sweden[7]\n\nCrown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia\n\nThe Prince of Wales[6]\n\nPrince Michael of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrince Ingolf of Denmark\n\nPrince Michael of Kent\n\nPrince Karl of Hesse-Kassel\n\nCount Michael Bernadotte af Wisborg\n\nGuests\n\n[edit]\n\nThe wedding was attended by 1200 guests from around the world.[8] As both the bride and groom were descendants of Victoria of the United Kingdom and Christian IX of Denmark, they were closely related to almost all of the royal houses in Europe, many of whom were in attendance.[2][a]\n\nRelatives of the bride\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King and Queen of Denmark, the bride's parents\n\nPrincess Margrethe of Denmark, the bride's sister\n\nPrincess Benedikte of Denmark, the bride's sister\n\nThe Hereditary Princess of Denmark, the bride's paternal aunt by marriage and first cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Denmark, the bride's first cousin\n\nPrince Ingolf of Denmark, the bride's first cousin\n\nPrince Christian of Denmark, the bride’s first cousin\n\nPrince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg, and Princess Viggo, Countess of Rosenborg, the bride's first cousin twice removed and his wife [9]\n\nPrincess René of Bourbon-Parma, the bride's first cousin twice removed\n\nPrincess Axel of Denmark, the bride's first cousin once removed (also widow of the bride's first cousin twice removed)\n\nPrince and Princess Georg of Denmark, the bride's second cousin and his wife\n\nThe King of Sweden, the bride's maternal grandfather\n\nThe Duke of Västerbotten's family:\n\nPrincess Birgitta and Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern, the bride's first cousin and her husband\n\nPrincess Christina of Sweden, the bride's first cousin\n\nThe Crown Prince of Sweden, the bride's first cousin\n\nCount Sigvard Bernadotte of Wisborg's family:\n\nCount Michael Bernadotte of Wisborg, the bride's first cousin\n\nRelatives of the groom\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen Frederica of Greece, the groom's mother\n\nThe Princess and Prince of Asturias, the groom's sister and brother-in-law\n\nPrincess Irene of Greece and Denmark, the groom's sister\n\nHelen, Queen Mother of Romania, the groom's paternal aunt\n\nQueen Anne of Romania, the bride and groom's mutual second cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Margareta of Romania, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Irene, Duchess of Aosta, the groom's paternal aunt\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Aosta, the groom's paternal first cousin and his wife\n\nPrincess Katherine of Greece and Denmark and Major Richard Brandram, the groom's paternal aunt and uncle\n\nCrown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nThe Princess Eugénie, Duchess of Castel Duino and Duke of Castel Duino, the groom's first cousin once removed, and her husband\n\nPrincess Tatiana Radziwiłł, the groom's second cousin\n\nPrince Jerzy Radziwiłł, the groom's second cousin\n\nPrincess Paul of Yugoslavia, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nThe Count of Törring-Jettenbach, widow of the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Marina, Duchess of Kent, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed, and the bride's paternal second cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Alexandra, The Hon.
