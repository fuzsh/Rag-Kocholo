        "text": "King Constantine II of Greece, King Charles III’s second cousin, will be buried in Athens next week following his death aged 82, it has been announced.\n\nConstantine, who ascended to the throne in 1964 during a fraught period of the country’s history, spent his final moments in an intensive care unit in a private hospital in Athens.\n\nRead More\n\nFrom one Spare to another: what Harry could learn from his aunt Princess Anne\n\nThe Duke of Sussex needs to be brought back to earth, and Princess Anne is the woman for the job. Raised in her brothers’ shadow, she has learned how to succeed at the long game – and keep the family together\n\nThe former king’s private office released a statement on Wednesday reading: ‘It is with deep sadness that the Royal Family announces that HM King Constantine, beloved husband, father, and brother, passed away yesterday, January 10, 2023, while being treated at HYGEIA hospital in Greece.’\n\nThe funeral procession will be held on 16 January in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, followed by the burial at Tatoi cemetery.\n\nThe death will come as a personal loss to King Charles, 74, who shared a close friendship with his Greek relative. Constantine’s father, King Paul, was a first cousin to Prince Philip and father-in-law to Juan Carlos I of Spain. Constantine is also godfather to Prince William, 40, and spent time with him and Prince Harry when they were younger.\n\nFollowing a military coup in 1967, and an unsuccessful counter-coup, Constantine II and his family moved to the UK where they bought a stunning 13-bedroom home in Hampstead, north London. The monarchy was abolished in 1973 and Constantine II was later stripped of his Greek citizenship.\n\nKing Constantine spent 46 years living in the Hampstead property with his wife Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark and their five children, who include Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, the husband of Princess Marie-Chantal and father of It girl Princess Maria-Olympia, on Linnell Drive close to Billionaire's Row, Bishops Avenue.\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales was a frequent visitor to the house in the 1990s, reportedly seen dropping off Prince William and Prince Harry there for playdates, and holidaying with the family in Europe. King Charles hosted Constantine’s 60th birthday at his Highgrove home, with the Queen and the then Duchess of Cornwall present, while his wife's 40th birthday was a ball held at Claridge’s which saw royals from across Europe attend.\n\nRead More\n\nQueen Letizia of Spain debuts new gold ring with hidden romantic message\n\nThe Spanish royal debuted the piece at her first royal engagement of 2023\n\nHe returned to Greece amidst the financial crash, when the country's rich were fleeing and its youth were leaving in order to find a better life. He invested heavily in the country.\n\nA keen sailor, Constantine II won gold in a team event at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. He also later served on the International Olympic Committee."
