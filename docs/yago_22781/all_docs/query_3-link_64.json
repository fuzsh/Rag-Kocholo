        "text": "Wonderful video above ,I'd never seen it before and was struck by the crowds cheering and waving,make me wonder how it all went wrong a few years later.\n\nAn Ard Ri, even experts in Greek historical and political matters seem to disgree on which side the King was really on after the military coup in 1967. I gave up on this many years ago!\n\nHere's a link to some pictures of the ball:\n\nball2\n\nAnd here's the contents of that whole website, where you can see other pre-wedding festivities, the engagement ball, the wedding, and so on:\n\nUntitled Document\n\nI think Anne-Marie was beautiful, but I don't like her dress for the pre-wedding ball. The sheer jacket she's wearing over it looks too big and makes it look like the dress is wearing her rather than the other way around.\n\nMaura724, The Engagement Ball pictures are lovely.\n\nI like the Procession to the Wedding photographs of King Constantine and his mother in the open carriage and of Princess Anne-Marie and King Frederik IX in an open landau.\n\n​\n\nIn occasion of premier of film \"Grace\" the italian magazine Oggi has posted an interesting photos gallery with princess Grace and prince Ranieri. The gallery includes also photos from wedding of king Costantin to princess Anne of Denmark.\n\nNicole Kidman diventa Grace Kelly: le foto mai viste della principessa dallâ€™archivio di Oggi | AttualitÃ*\n\nThe photos are Bellissimo (Beautiful)!!\n\n​\n\nThe Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Top 10 Best Royal Wedding Dresses: #1. HM Queen Anne-Marie\n\nAnne Marie's wedding dress is one of my all time favorites. It has all the aspects of a wedding gown that I love: timeless design, simplicity, elegance, and beautiful style. I also love her veil and jewels. Truly a regal and wonderful gown."
