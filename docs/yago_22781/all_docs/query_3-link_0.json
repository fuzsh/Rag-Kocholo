        "text": "Born on 30 August 1946, the royal was born Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, the youngest of three daughters born to King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark. Her older sisters are Queen Margrethe II of Denmark (who recently made headlines due to her decision to strip four of her grandchildren of their royal titles) and Princess Benedikte of Denmark.\n\nThe sisters are related to the British Royal Family though their maternal grandmother Princess Margaret of Connaught, who was daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. This made Anne-Marie a third cousin of both Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Anne-Marie is also the first cousin of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the second cousin of King Harald V of Norway and a third cousin of King Juan Carlos I of Spain (father of King Felipe VI).\n\nRead More\n\nWho’s who in the next generation of the Greek royal family? From Princess Olympia to Prince Constantine-Alexios\n\nMoney, power and beauty. Following Prince Michael of Greece's death, discover why the Greek royal family have been hailed the world’s ‘most glamorous’\n\nThis complex family tree is reflected in Anne-Marie’s dazzling list of godparents. Among them were representatives from five European monarchies, including Britain’s Queen Mary (wife of King George V).\n\nAnne-Marie spent her formative years living between Danish royal palaces in Copenhagen and North Zealand. She was less than a year old when her father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX, following the death of her grandfather Christian X. At the time, only male heirs were recognised in the line of succession. However, this was changed in 1953 and Margrethe, Frederick’s eldest daughter, became heir apparent. Benedikte and Anne-Marie were second and third in line to the throne.\n\nRead More\n\nPrince Philippos of Greece and Denmark, Princess Diana’s dashing godson, turns 37\n\nAs he celebrates his 37th birthday, Tatler looks at the charmed life of Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark\n\nLike Queen Elizabeth II, Anne-Marie was only a teenager when she met her future husband. Constantine, a distant cousin, was introduced to the young princess while accompanying his parents King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece, on a state visit to Denmark in 1959. The pair crossed paths several times over the next few years, including at the wedding of Constantine’s sister Princess Sofia of Greece and Denmark (now Queen Sofia of Spain) to the then Prince Juan Carlos of Spain (the future King Juan Carlos I). Constantine and Anne-Marie announced their engagement in July 1964, four months after he had succeeded his father as King of the Hellenes.\n\nFollowing a military coup in 1967, and an unsuccessful counter-coup, Constantine II and his family were exiled. Queen Anne-Marie, along with the rest of her family lived in a number of places including Britain and Italy. The monarchy was ultimately abolished in 1973 and Constantine II was later stripped of his Greek citizenship. Anne-Marie was not allowed to return to her beloved country until 1981 where she was allowed to attend the funeral of her mother-in-law. Constantine II returned to Greece amidst the financial crash, when the country's rich were fleeing and its youth were leaving in order to find a better life. He invested heavily in the country.\n\nRead More\n\nPrince William and Kate will embrace a poignant leadership role on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II’s death\n\nKing Charles III will be supported by Prince William and Kate as he spend the day privately in Balmoral\n\nIn January this year, Constantine II died of a stroke aged 82. Representatives from Europe's royal families made the journey to Athens to support Anne-Marie and her family. During his funeral, she paid tribute to her beloved husband in two important ways. First, she wore the crucifix that she wore on her wedding day. She also wore a wreath made up of white lilies, which was the same flower that was used for her bridal bouquet.\n\nUndoubtedly, the death of her beloved husband will mean this birthday is particularly poignant for Queen Anne-Marie."
