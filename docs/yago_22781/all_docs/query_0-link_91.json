My thought process was that the Queen and the late King were the onnly members of the royal family that had taken residence in Greece. Therefore  one would think the Queen would move to Denmark to be closer to her Danish family perhaps  i.e.  for support after this large loss in her life now.          Even though Queen Anne-Marie only spent the first 3 years of her marriage and the last 10 years in Greece  almost her entire life has been spent somehow connected to Greek interests. She and King Constantine founded the bilingual Hellenic College of London and that is where their children attended school. Her second son  Nikolaos and his wife  Tatiana  live in Athens.    Her elder daughter  Princess Alexia  lives on Lanzorote in the Canary Islands  Crown Prince Pavlos lives in New York City as does her youngest son  Prince Phillipos.  Her younger daughter lives in Los Angeles.       quote     Since my last post the spokesperson for the Greek Royal Family  Ivi Macris  has issued a statement saying that Queen Anne Marie will remain domicile in Athens.  At the same time  a statement was made regarding Crown Prince Pavlos stating that he has no intention of relocating from New York to Greece.   There were rumours floating around that he was going to move to Greece.    quote   Thank you  Kirsten  Tak . Yes  I wasn't sure if the children of the senior Greek royal family  Constantine   Anne-Marie  had settled in Greece. Therefore  I surmised she may move back to Denmark to be closer to her sister  Queen Margrethe. Anyhow  may HM King Constantine rest in peace.   quote   Sorry  Jason  I don't know the answer to your question about smoking.  I do know that Princess Benedikte smoked before her marriage but quit before she had children  so she quit a long time ago.     As to whether Queen Anne-Marie will move to Denmark  of course I don't know  but I rather doubt it as she has family in Greece and Spain.  Her visits to Denmark may be longer in duration  though  as she and her sisters enjoy time spent together.   quote   In the photo  King Constantine is enjoying a smoke whilst holding a cup of hot beverage. However  did or does Queen Anne-Marie smoke as well? I know that her parents  King Frederik and Queen Ingrid  both smoked as well as Queen Margrethe.
