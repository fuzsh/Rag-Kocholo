        "text": "Greece's former and last King Constantine II died on Tuesday aged 82. Suffering from chronic heart and mobility problems, the former king's health condition had worsened and he had been hospitalised several times in recent months. King Constantine was his countryâ€™s head of state between 1964 and 1973.\n\nIn his last public appearance in the centre of Athens last year, former King Constantine was seen in a wheelchair and with supplementary oxygen, accompanied by his sister, the former Queen Sofia of Spain, and other family members.\n\nKing Constantine II of Greece was a second cousin of King Charles III and a godfather of the Prince of Wales. King Constantine and his family had lived in London for years, before returning to Greece. His wife was Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, whom he married in 1964. They had five children together."
