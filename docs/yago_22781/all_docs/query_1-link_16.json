        "text": "Following the sad news that King Constantine II, the last monarch of Greece, has passed away aged 82, his wife of 58 years Queen Anne-Marie will be helping to organise his private funeral.\n\nKing Charles' second cousin Constantine was being treated at a private hospital in Athens for ill health before his office released an official statement confirming his death on Wednesday. It read: \"It is with deep sadness that the Royal Family announces that HM King Constantine, beloved husband, father, and brother, passed away yesterday, January 10, 2023, while being treated at 'HYGEIA' hospital in Greece.\"\n\nWATCH: King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie did not have the most expensive royal wedding of all time. See who took the top spot...\n\nThe former King, who was exiled in 1967, was 24 when he married his wife, then 18, in 1964. The couple welcomed five children Princess Alexia, Crown Prince Pavlos, Prince Nikolaos, Princess Theodora and Prince Philippos before Constantine sadly passed away. Look back at Prince William's godfather Constantine's marriage with Anne-Marie…\n\nHow did King Constantine meet his wife Anne-Marie?\n\nThe royals were married for 58 years before the King passed away in January 2023\n\nThen-Crown Prince Constantine, aged 19, first crossed paths with 13-year-old Anne-Marie when he accompanied his parents King Paul and Queen Frederica on a State Visit to Denmark, where he was hosted by Anne-Marie's parents King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid.\n\nTRENDING: Prince Harry discusses 'unnecessary' King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla wedding\n\nTwo years later, the couple met again in Denmark, and things turned romantic when Anne-Marie acted as bridesmaid to his sister, Sofía, in Athens in May 1962. Following several visits to Denmark to see Anne-Marie, Constantine proposed just months later during a trip to Norway. But it was not initially announced to the press…\n\nWhen did King Constantine propose to Anne-Marie?\n\nThe couple announced their engagement in 1963\n\nConsidering Anne-Marie was just 16 at the time of Constantine's proposal, her father was hesitant about giving his blessing. He asked the couple to keep their engagement secret until she had finished her education and turned 18.\n\nIn January 1963, the Danish royal court announced the couple's plans to marry in 1965. See the heartbreaking reason why the royal wedding was moved forward…\n\nGET SHOPPING: 29 of the best diamond engagement rings from Vera Wang, Tiffany and more\n\nWhen did King Constantine get married?\n\nThe royal wedding took place earlier than planned following Constantine's accession to the throne\n\nKing Paul was diagnosed with cancer in 1964 and tragically passed away from a pulmonary embolism in March 1964, meaning Constantine's accession to the throne. His wedding to Anne-Marie was brought forward to 18 September 1964, when the couple exchanged vows in front of 1,200 guests, including King Charles, before enjoying a reception at the Royal Palace.\n\nWhat wedding dress did King Constantine's wife Anne-Marie wear?\n\nIn a nod to her Danish heritage, Anne-Marie rocked a wedding dress by Danish designer Jorgen Bender, complete with cropped sleeves and an empire line waist and a 20-foot train. She teamed it with a diamond tiara belonging to her mother and a lace veil from her grandmother Margaret. Meanwhile, the King wore his white uniform.\n\nThree years later, Constantine was forced into exile after clashing with military rulers.\n\nNOW DISCOVER: Prince William 'frustrated' he had no say in royal wedding outfit"
