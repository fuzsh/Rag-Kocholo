        "text": "Prince William has pulled out of attending a memorial service for his godfather, Greece’s late King Constantine II, due to “a personal matter” amid Kate Middleton’s abdominal-surgery recovery, according to Kensington Palace.\n\n“Unfortunately, The Prince of Wales is no longer able to attend the King Constantine Memorial Service this morning due to a personal matter,” the palace said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nNo further details as to why William, 41, missed the event were given. However, the palace did note that the Duchess of Wales, 42, is “doing well.”\n\nSeveral other members of the royal family gathered to celebrate the life of King Constantine of Greece at Windsor Castle, including Queen Camilla; Prince Andrew; Sarah Ferguson; Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi; Princess Anne; and Zara Tindall and her husband, Mike Tindall.\n\nConstantine died Jan. 10, 2023 at age 82.\n\nWilliam was initially set to attend the event solo without Middleton. The Duchess of Cambridge is recuperating at her home, Adelaide Cottage, that stands on the Windsor grounds and will not be making any public appearances until at least after Easter.\n\nWilliam had notified Constantine’s family of his absence, alerting his widow, Queen Anne-Marie, and their son Crown Prince Pavlos and his wife, Crown Princess Marie-Chantal.\n\nCamilla, 76, arrived without husband King Charles, 75, who is currently undergoing treatment for his cancer.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge also missed out on the Greek monarch’s funeral last January.\n\nHis cousin, Lady Gabriella Kingston, stood in his place. The editor, 42, is the daughter of Prince Michael of Kent, Queen Elizabeth’s first cousin.\n\nA medley of European crowned heads descended upon Athens for the burial. Among them were the Princess Royal, 73, and Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia.\n\nThe former Olympian was then buried privately at Tatoi Palace in Greece.\n\nConstantine and the Greek royal family were close to their British counterparts. Queen Elizabeth’s husband, Prince Philip, was a royal of Greek and Danish blood, and was born on the Greek island Corfu.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was a first cousin of Constantine’s father, King Paul I.\n\nWilliam is even a godfather to one of Prince Pavlos’ children, Constantine Alexios.\n\nWhile King Constantine became the sovereign of Greece in 1964, the monarchy was abolished in 1973. He was then exiled to Britain."
