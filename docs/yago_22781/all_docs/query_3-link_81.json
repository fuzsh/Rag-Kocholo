        "text": "There were some heartbreaking scenes as King Constantine's family laid him to rest in a funeral service in Athens on Monday.\n\nLeading the mourners – which included a number of prominent European royals – was his wife of 58 years, Anne-Marie, who looked understandably devastated at the loss of her husband.\n\nWATCH: Royal love stories: How did these couples meet?\n\nThe couple got engaged in 1962 when she was 16; her father King Frederick IX of Denmark was initially hesitant about giving his blessing given her age. He asked the couple to keep their engagement secret until she had finished her education and turned 18.\n\nIn January 1963, the Danish royal court announced the couple's plans to marry.\n\nConstantine and Anne-Marie pictured on their wedding day in 1964\n\nDuring their long marriage, they welcomed five children together. Constantine and Anne-Marie were the last of the Greek monarchs; the monarchy was abolished in June 1973, nine years after Constantine became king.\n\nREAD NOW: King Charles' exiled cousin King Constantine met his wife aged 13 – inside 58-year marriage\n\nWOW: Queen Letizia and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece put long-standing feud behind them: See photo\n\nThe pair were devoted with each other – as evidenced by Anne-Marie's moving tribute to her husband at his funeral.\n\nThe couple were happily married for 58 years\n\nHer wreath was comprised of lilies of the valley, the same flowers that were used for her wedding bouquet in 1964. And the attached card revealed her final words to her husband: \"Your beloved Anna-Maria.\"\n\nSO SAD: Queen Margrethe of Denmark mourns family death – as European royals gather in Greece\n\nPoignantly, she also wore the same diamond cross pendant that she wore at her wedding.\n\nAnne-Marie was clearly heartbroken at the funeral for her husband\n\nThe couple were married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 18 September 1964 in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. The couple exchanged vows in front of 1,200 guests, including King Charles, before enjoying a reception at the Royal Palace.\n\nHer bouquet for Constantine\n\nIn a nod to her Danish heritage, Anne-Marie rocked a wedding dress by Danish designer Jorgen Bender, complete with cropped sleeves and an empire line waist and a 20-foot train. She teamed it with a diamond tiara belonging to her mother and a lace veil from her grandmother Margaret. Meanwhile, the King wore his white uniform.\n\nThree years later, Constantine was forced into exile after clashing with military rulers."
