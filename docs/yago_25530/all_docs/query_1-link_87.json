They'd become the famous Reyes Catolicos, the Catholic monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, and would bring together two powerful kingdoms, which comprised most of what is modern-day Spain.\n\nIn today's talk, I tell you more about this powerful couple, their reigns and their legacy.\n\nAlso on this day in Tudor history, 19th October 1536, the Pilgrimage of Grace Rebellion in the north of England was well underway, and King Henry VIII had come to the decision that tough action was needed to put it down. The action he ordered wasn’t just tough, it was downright brutal, and you can find out more about it in last year’s video:\n\nAlso on this day in history:\n\n1512 – Reformer Martin Luther was awarded his Doctorate of Theology from the University of Wittenberg.\n\n1592 – Death of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, courtier and member of Parliament, at his manor of West Horsley, Surrey, He was buried at Midhurst. Montagu served Mary I as an ambassador and Privy Councillor, and Elizabeth I as Lord Lieutenant of Sussex.\n\nTranscript:\n\nOn this day in history, an event took place in Spain that was not only important in Spanish history, but which had an impact on Europe and which has links with the Tudors.\n\nFor, on 19th October 1469, in the Palacio de los Vivero in Valladolid, in what is now Castile and Leon, in Spain, a couple who would become the famous Reyes Catolicos, the Catholic monarchs, got married.\n\nThe bride was eighteen-year-old Isabella, daughter of John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal, and the groom was seventeen-year-old Ferdinand, son of John II of Aragon and Juana Enriquez. The couple were second cousins, both being descended from John I of Castile.\n\nIsabella wasn’t supposed to marry Ferdinand. Her half-brother, Henry IV of Castile, had negotiated several matches for her even after he had named her heir presumptive and promised that he wouldn’t force her to marry against her wishes. Most recently, in 1468, Henry had been arranging a match between Isabella and his brother-in-law Alfonso V of Portugal and then Charles, Duke of Berry, brother of King Louis XI of France. Isabella was against the idea, preferring Ferdinand, to whom she’d been betrothed when she was just six years old. Isabella corresponded with John II of Aragon and secretly promised to marry Ferdinand. Cardinal Rodrigo de Borgia, the future Pope Alexander VI, helped the couple to obtain a dispensation from the Pope to cover the fact that they were related within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity, and then Isabella left court, pretending that she was going to visit her brother’s tomb in Ávila. Instead, she met up with Ferdinand, who had disguised himself as a servant. They married on this day in 1469.\n\nIsabella became Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1474, following the death of her half-brother, and Ferdinand became King Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1479, following his father’s death. Their marriage was an important one, for it united the powerful kingdoms of Aragon and Castile, a vast territory which comprised most of what is modern-day Spain.\n\nThey didn’t have things easy though. Isabella had to deal with plots against her and war over the succession, but she remained queen and reigned until her death in November 1504. Ferdinand remarried in 1506, taking Germaine de Foix, niece of King Louis XII of France, as his wife. He died in January 1516."
