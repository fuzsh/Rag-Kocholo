        "text": "Catherine of Aragon\n\nKnown for: first queen consort of Henry VIII; mother of Mary I of England; Catherine's refusal to be put aside for a new queen—and the Pope's support of her position—led to Henry's separating the Church of England from the Church of Rome\n\nOccupation: queen consort of Henry VIII of England\n\nBorn: December 16, 1485 in Madrid\n\nDied: January 7, 1536 at Kimbolton Castle. She was buried in Peterborough Abbey (later became known as Peterborough Cathedral) on January 29, 1536.

She ruled as Mary I.\n\nNovember 9-10, 1518: daughter, stillborn or died shortly after birth\n\nPhysical Description\n\nOften in fiction or depictions of history, Catherine of Aragon is depicted with dark hair and brown eyes, presumably because she was Spanish. But in life, Catherine of Aragon had red hair and blue eyes.\n\nAmbassador\n\nAfter Arthur's death and before her marriage to Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon served as ambassador to the English court, representing the Spanish court, thereby becoming the first woman to be a European ambassador.\n\nRegent\n\nCatherine of Aragon served as regent for her husband, Henry VIII, for six months when he was in France in 1513. During that time, the English won the Battle of Flodden, with Catherine taking an active role in the planning.\n\nCatherine of Aragon Biography\n\nCatherine of Aragon: Early Life and First Marriage\n\nCatherine of Aragon: Marriage to Henry VIII\n\nCatherine of Aragon: The King's Great Matter\n\nFormat\n\nmla apa chicago\n\nYour Citation\n\nLewis, Jone Johnson. \"Facts About Catherine of Aragon.\" ThoughtCo, Apr. 5, 2023, thoughtco.com/catherine-of-aragon-facts-3528153.
