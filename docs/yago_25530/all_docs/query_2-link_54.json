        "text": "Martavious Spicer\n\nMarch 21, 2017\n\nFirst Draft Essay\n\nProf. Palmer\n\nThe Kween of Spain\n\nThe role of women in society, specifically women of power, is a topic of much debate. However, the life and reign of Queen Isabella of Spain, more accurately known as Queen Isabel I of Castile and León is regarded as one of the most extra-ordinary of anyone in Early Modern Europe. Notice I said, anyone, Queen Isabella was as remarkable a leader as any king in European history. Historians have long fought with the exact degree to which Isabel personified or transcended the gender norms of her time, as well as whether or not she ruled more through the joint monarchy beside her husband King Fernando of Aragón or as a sovereign-monarch in her own merit. The analysis of primary and secondary documents describing Isabel’s life, her fight for her position on the throne, use of propaganda, joint monarchy, and her more notable achievements reveal her resolute conviction in her own right to be queen and give insight to the intricacies of her power. Isabel was to the expectations of her time period, Isabel challenged gender norms and ruled independently as a sovereign queen. The strength of her independent power shows that even when faced with communal and political difficulty and backlash, women can effectively lead in powerful leadership positions. Female leaders today can learn important lessons from Isabel’s resiliency and forte.\n\nAs the lone daughter of the King of Castile and León, Isabel’s early life was strongly influenced by her proximity to ever-fluctuating royal power. She was born on April 22nd, 1451 in Madrigal de las Altas Torres to Juan II and Isabel of Portugal. Her father died when she was three and her older brother became King Henry IV. The Spanish nobles had become very powerful during the reign of John II. Henry did not go over with the public; They felt that he was not very smart and would not be a good leader. The public’s displeasure with Enrique’s rule was apparent by the end 1464, when his opponents united around Alfonso (Isabel’s brother) as rightful king. Shockingly, Alfonso died after battling an illness in 1468, the aristocrats then contacted Isabella bring peace between both the rebels and the crown; Enrique named her his heir under the circumstances that the then seventeen year old Isabel would need his consent to marry. In opposition, she went against his wishes and married Fernando of Aragón on October 19th, 1469; a ruler who was receptive to female sovereignty which clearly shows that Isabel had learned the importance of political support and leverage by the time Enrique’s health began to decline in the early 1470s. When he died on December 11th, 1474, she was able to prevail through a civil war to take the crown.\n\nA beautiful woman, Isabel’s intellect and ethical personality are key to understanding her administration. Writing in 1601, reporter Juan de Mariana depicts her being “attractive in appearance… demonstrating a singular gravity, moderation, and modesty.” (Mariana) Her façade gained her acceptance by society and her intellect made her a polished politician. Researchers argue the precise nature of her schooling, but most agree that she knew Latin at the very least. (Griffiths, p. 19) Therefore, she had access to the intellectual movements sweeping across Europe and scholarly dissertations on sovereign power.\n\nAn ideal medieval woman was chaste, modest, and pious. (Weissberger, p.170) Although these traits were not always effective characteristics of royalty, Theresa Earenfight writes that “Isabel was always careful to follow those expectations for the sake of her own power.” She knew the importance of working within the patriarchal system. These two aspects of her character adhered exactly to how an ideal woman of the time should act. However, women in general were also seen as fundamentally flawed. In his fourteenth century work, Concerning Famous Women, the celebrated Renaissance humanist Giovanni Boccaccio makes clear that women are fundamentally weak. While describing the legendary Joan, who disguised herself as a man to become a female Pope, he affirms that it is unnatural for a woman to have an authoritative political position. A contemporary of Isabel, Martín de Córdoba, writes that “the female body is weak and soft, so is her soul malleable in its desire and will.” A good ruler needed to be able to make strong and logical decisions, something women were believed to be incapable of doing. Elizabeth Lehfeldt writes that to be an effective ruler, Isabel would have “to acknowledge her shortcomings as a woman and to transcend these characterizations whenever possible.”12 She could not ignore the gender norms of her time, but as a woman in power she could not completely embody the traits expected of the female sex. After careful examination, it seems that Isabel was far more likely to demonstrate behavior considered inappropriate for women than submit to men.\n\nThe influence of a joint monarchy on Isabel’s personal power is one of the most intense debates surrounding royalty in Early Modern Europe and women’s role in positions in power holistically. In terms of function, the creation of the joint monarchy was a practical political move by Isabel. It permitted her to make her position more profound to those uneasy with female sovereignty. (Weissberger, p. 34) Fernando was treated as a king within Isabel’s territories and anything official would come from them both, implying that decisions and procedures would be made together. Earenfight sees the joint monarchy as the most important factor of Isabel’s rule. On the other hand, researchers such as Barbara Weissberger view Isabel as a monarch independent of Fernando, and far more powerful. Her power came from the authority of the Castilian throne. Lehfeldt largely agrees with Weissberger and alludes to the fact that within Isabel’s sovereign domain of Castile, Fernando was a king-companion rather than an equal ruler. Although both arguments are excellently defended, research indicates that Isabel was far more autonomous than mutual as a monarch.\n\nLegally, there was no ban to the rule of the female Isabel, only societal hesitancy. There was a established tradition of women in positions of power in Castile and Aragón, which gave Isabel vital historical credibility. (Earenfight, p. 4) In particular Urraca of Castile and León and Juana Enríquez of Aragon provided Isabel with exemplary models of queenship. Urraca reigned as a queen in her own right from 1109-1126 and it was her rule that “established a legal precedent for Isabel’s legitimate succession.” (Earenfight, p. 8) Urraca had shown that female rule was a practical possibility for the kingdom, regardless of negative social expectations.\n\nIsabel’s royal lineage secured her faith that she was ordained to be the rightful and sole ruler of Castile. To have known this for so long created a resolute conviction within her. With her lineage, it was clear to her that she was meant to rule. However, although she was declared Enrique’s heir in 1468, her claim did not go uncontested. Despite significant doubts over her paternity Enrique’s daughter, Juana, fought Isabel for five years before Isabel managed to secure her throne. (Jansen, p. 12) Fernando also had a distant claim to the Castilian throne, but due to the fact that Isabel was a more direct descendant of the kings of Castile, her ancestry was superior. (Griffiths, p. 20) Her bloodline was purer than his and, consequently, ruled in her own right.\n\nDuring her time as queen, Isabel independently passed significant reforms, particularly to the justice system in Castile. Tax system reform, the increased value of Castilian currency and the flourishing of printing presses due to tax exemption were all attributed to Isabel alone. Even as a woman, she received sole credit for these changes that enhanced the economic and intellectual life of the kingdom. In contrast to her foremothers, Isabel managed justice through judges and courts rather than the army and nobility. During a two-month period, she heard cases and pronounced rulings herself once a week. She made these decisions and resolutions independently of any other power; fairness was her prerogative as a ruler, regardless of her gender. Most notably she initiated permanent royal courts called “audiencias” in regional cities. Royal authority and justice was now available in every corner in Castile. (Weissberger, p. 136)\n\nResearchers often group Isabel with Elizabeth I of England; the two great prototypes of female sovereignty in Early Modern European history. Although both women held brilliant levels of power and defy gender norms during their respective time eras, there are significant differences between them, best shown by their views on marriage as a political apparatus. Regardless your stance on joint monarchy, Isabel’s marriage to Fernando gave her important sustenance and validity. However, for Elizabeth “virginity seemed integral to her ability to get and maintain her position.” (Jansen, p. 153) She preferred to influence gender constructs for her own reasons while appearing to work within their bounds. She can still provide insight for contemporary women. Important lessons can still be learned from her willpower and fortitude. A woman of extraordinary political power who accomplished more than was ever expected of her even in the face of much adversity.\n\nQueen Isabel I with her husband King Fernando II of Aragón by her side, united the Spanish kingdoms and oversaw a beautiful age in Spanish history. Isabel should be respected as a powerful sovereign in her own right. In spite of the substandard status of most women at the time, she became one the most powerful rulers in European history, regardless of gender. Although she did have some beliefs that were rooted in traditional gender roles and worked closely with Fernando, Isabel’s certainty in her right to the throne caused her to destabilize sexual gender norms delicately. She ruled as an independent sovereign; the importance of her own dominance and dominion surpasses everything else.\n\nBibliography:\n\nJuan de Mariana, “The Conquest of Granada,” 1601, in Early Modern Spain: A Documentary History\n\nCristina Guardiola-Griffiths, Legitimizing the Queen: Propaganda and Ideology in the\n\nReign of Isabel I of Castile (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 2011)\n\nBarbara F.
