        "text": "The House of Trastámara\n\nThe house of Trastámara was a dynasty of Kings that ruled the Crown of Castile, Crown of Aragon, Kingdom of Navarre, and Kingdom of Naples in the late fourteenth century, fifteenth century, and first decades of the sixteenth century. The house took the name of the Count of Trastámara, a title used by Henry II of Castile, before he became king after killing his half brother King Peter I in the battle of Montiel (1369). His son, John I of Castile, endeavoured to enforce the claims of his second wife Beatrice of Portugal, only child of King Ferdinand I, to the Crown of Portugal. He was resisted by supporters of his rival for the throne, John I of Portugal, and was utterly defeated at the battle of Aljubarrota. He also had to contend with the hostility of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who claimed the Crown of Castile by right of his wife Constance of Castile, the eldest daughter of the murdered King Peter. John I of Castile finally bought off the claim of his English competitor by arranging a marriage between his son, the future Henry III, and princess Catherine of Lancaster, daughter of Constance and John of Gaunt. The marriage helped to restore a semblance of legitimacy to the Trastámara line.\n\nAfter becoming a widow, Catherine of Lancaster was regent of the Crown of Castile during the minority of her son, John II. Catherine managed to improve relations with England and Portugal, without breaking with France, a traditional Trastámara’s ally. Queen Catherine was widely criticized by her contemporaries because she surrounded herself with some women, to whom she distinguished with her confidence and taking into account their opinions on governance issues. Her brother-in-law, Ferdinand of Antequera, was a nephew of King Martín I of Aragon. After his dead without any heir in 1410, Ferdinand was elected King of Aragon in the Compromise of Caspe in 1412.\n\nFerdinand I of Aragon was the first Trastámara King of the Crown of Aragon. His reign was brief but intense and fruitful, both in domestic and foreign policy. He died in 1416 and was succeeded by his son, Alfonso V of Aragon. In 1442, Alfonso V succeeded to the Neapolitan throne by conquest. He was one of the most prominent figures of the early Renaissance. His wife, Maria of Castile, served as Queen-Lieutenant of the Crown of Aragon from 1420-23 and 1432-58 in absence of her husband. She had a constant interest in the politics of peace and concord between the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, united through links of kinship. Alfonso and Maria failed to produce children. In the Kingdom of Naples he was succeeded by his illegitimate son, Ferdinand I, and his brother, John of Navarre, was King of Aragon as John II.\n\nJohn II of Aragon was engaged in incessant conflicts with his Navarrese and Catalan subjects, with Louis XI of France, and his children Charles of Viana and Blanche of Navarre. He prepared the way for the marriage of his son Ferdinand with Isabella I of Castile. John married in first nuptials with the Navarrese queen Blanche I and became King of Navarre. His second wife, the Castilian noblewoman Juana Enríquez, served as Governor of Navarre and Lieutenant General for her husband. Queen Juana was a co-ruler with John II. She was one of his closest advisers and most valuable allies. His daughter Eleanor, Countess of Foix, inherited the Kingdom of Navarre on his death in 1479 as Eleanor I of Navarre, but she died three weeks later. His son, Ferdinand II, was King of Aragon.\n\nFerdinand I of Naples was the first King of this dynasty in the Neapolitan kingdom. Ferdinand had many enemies, especially considering his kingdom’s importance to other rulers, and he was ruthless in response to any perceived slight. His second wife, Joanna of Aragon, daughter of King John II and Juana Enríquez, showed a tendency to resolve political affairs. He was succeeded by his eldest son Alfonso II. As Duke of Calabria he was a patron of Renaissance poets and builders during his tenure as the heir to the throne of Naples. Alfonso gave his stepmother, Joanna of Aragon, the position of Lieutenant General of the Kingdom of Naples. Alfonso’s reign was destined to be short. When his father died, the kingdom’s finances were exhausted and the invasion of King Charles VIII of France was imminent. He abdicated in favour of his son, Ferdinand II, and fled, entering a Sicilian monastery. Ferdinand II married his half-aunt Joanna of Naples, daughter of Ferdinand I and Joanna of Aragon. Ferdinand II died that same year. He was childless and was succeeded by his uncle, Joanna’s half-brother Frederick. Frederick IV was the last King of Naples of the Neapolitan branch of the House of Trastámara. French and Aragonese forces occupied Naples in 1501.\n\nJohn II of Castile’s reign, lasting 48 years, was one of the longest in Castilian history, but John himself was not a particularly capable monarch. He spent his time verse-making, hunting, and holding tournaments. His favourite, Álvaro de Luna, heavily influenced him until his second wife, Isabella of Portugal, obtained control of his feeble will. At her instigation, he dismissed his faithful and able servant, an act which is said to have caused him much remorse. Her son, Henry IV, is considered the last of the weak late medieval kings of the Crown of Castile. His first marriage with Blanche of Navarre was childless, and ended in divorce. He then married Joanna of Portugal, who bore a daughter, Joanna. The king’s enemies were subsequently to allege that he was impotent, and that Joanna was the fruit of an adulterous relationship between the queen and his favourite, Beltrán de la Cueva. One faction recognized Henry’s younger half brother Alfonso, deposing Henry in effigy in the “ Farce of Avila.” After three years of civil war Alfonso died, and Henry vacillated about the claim of his infant daughter. His rivals then recognized his half sister, Isabella (the future Isabella I), who, without Henry’s knowledge or consent, married the heir to the throne of Aragon, Ferdinand (the future Ferdinand II).\n\nWhen Henry IV died in 1474, Isabella acted quickly. Three days after Henry’s death, she was crowned Queen of Castile at Segovia. While she and Ferdinand began to reorganize the court, Alfonso V of Portugal crossed the border and declared his wife and niece, Joanna of Castile, the rightful heir. The first four years of Isabella I of Castile’s reign were thus occupied by a civil war, which ended in defeat for her Castilian opponents and for the Portuguese king. Joanna was forced to renounce her titles as Infanta of Castile and Queen regnant of Castile, and she chose to enter the Convent of Santa Clara in Coimbra. She was not incarcerated in the convent, and was eventually allowed to reside in the Castle of São Jorge in Lisbon.\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand formed one of the most powerful rulers couples in History. They are known for the conquest of the kingdom of Granada (the last Muslim enclave in the Iberian Peninsula) and the Canary Islands, for ordering conversion or exile of their Muslim and Jewish subjects, for the introduction of the Inquisition, and for supporting and financing Christopher Columbus’ 1492 voyage that led to the opening of the “New World”. During the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain pursued alliances with Portugal, the Habsburg Monarchy and England through the marriage of their five children. Ferdinand’s political acumen, deviousness and strength of character were generously praised in Machiavelli’s Prince. Isabella was a patroness of scholars and artists, establishing educational institutions and building a large collection of art works. She died at Medina del Campo in 1504, and was succeeded by her daughter Joanna and her husband Philip of Habsburg.\n\nIn 1504, after a war with France, Ferdinand II of Aragon became King of Naples. Ferdinand objected to his son-in-law Philip’s policies and to prevent Philip from gaining Aragon through Joanna, he sought to have a male heir with a new wife. A new male heir would displace Joanna (and by extension her husband) from the line of succession. He married the young Germaine of Foix, niece of King Louis XII of France. In absence of her husband, Germaine acted as Lieutenant General of the Crown of Aragon. Ferdinand and Germaine did have a son, John, Prince of Girona, but he died shortly after birth. Despite the use of love potions, they did not have another. In 1512, Ferdinand became King of Navarre by conquest. He annexed Navarre to the Crown of Castile. After Philip’s death in 1506, Queen Joanna I of Castile was deemed mentally ill and was confined to a nunnery for the rest of her life. Though she remained the legal queen of Castile throughout this time, her father, Ferdinand II of Aragon, was regent until his death, when she inherited his kingdom as well. From 1517, her son, Charles, ruled as king, while she nominally remained co-monarch. Queen Joanna was the last Trastámara of the kingdoms of Spain."
