Maybe there was not anything special about their dynamics and reign? In fact, Isabella and Ferdinand were the most remarkable couple of the 15th century. It can be said they astonished their contemporaries for they had managed to rule together for over 30 years and achieved multiple goals.\n\nThe dual nature of the Spanish monarchy nevertheless, still intrigued the English visitors.\n\n‘Perhaps some may blame me that I speak of “kings” (in plural) and some people may be astonished, and say, “How! Are there two kings in Castile?”’ observed the herald Roger Machado, one of the English ambassadors’ party when he wrote down his impressions of that journey. ‘No [I say], but I write “kings” because the king is king on account of the queen, by right of marriage, and because they call themselves “kings” and superscribe their letters “By the king and queen”, for she is the heiress [of the throne].’\n\nThese were atypical monarchs for their - or almost - any time.\n\nGiles Tremlett\n\nI gathered and translated (in order to cite them) some opinions of a couple of historians on the matter.\n\n“Isabella was named the Lieutenant of the Crown of Aragon. It means that during the king’s absence, she was the one to execute royal power. There were moments when she, obviously, took part in making decisions that concerned Aragon.”\n\nOscar Villarroel\n\n“Just like Ferdinand spent a bit more than 1000 days outside of Castile, Isabella barely stayed in Aragon. She was there for her coronation as Queen Consort of Aragon, the ceremony which took place at the Cathedral of Saragossa where coronation of the kings usually took place, she also went to Barcelona and Valencia in order to be sworn in and many years later she came back to Barcelona where she and her husband received Christopher Columbus when he had returned from his first voyage. The Kingdom of Aragon, when the city of Barcelona had been once and for all conquered, during the lifetime of king John II, didn’t cause them many problems. Ferdinand ruled there through the viceroys. The figure of a viceroy would be later crucial in regards to the governorship of the Indias.”\n\nÁngeles de Irisarri\n\nThe methods of the governorship of The Catholic Monarchs\n\n“Irisarri believes that they didn’t differ that much: ‘In fact when they won the throne, they wonderfully shared power and during the absence of one or another or due to some illness, they were capable of attending the matters of state, each of them on their own, and do it superbly; they brought back the political system known as diarchy - the simultaneous reign of two monarchs that had been already used in the Ancient Times. First they managed to have the nobles back at their side, without granting them great favours, then they won the civil war with the king of Portugal, later putting everything in order in the Kingdom and then they occuppied themselves with the reconquest of Granada which they managed to achieve. Isabella and Ferdinand cooperated since both had political sense and they were well-matched.’”\n\n“Villarroel also believes that Isabella and Ferdinand got along because they wanted the same thing and were using the same ways to achieve it: ‘Deep down they both were using similar weapons, like it could be noticed in the series. Isabella and Ferdinand were aware of their goals and knew which methods they could use to achieve them: all of them. Deep down inside when it comes to Machiavelism (in its twisted and hidden meaning) they both could be the same: they would make temporal agreements which they knew they wouldn’t or just didn’t want to fulfill, making an use of the circumstances even though their politics would change later, due to the changes of the said circumstances.’”\n\n“The new and extraordinary way or ruling of Isabella and Ferdinand was to be symbolised by the motto: tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando (it amounts to the same, Isabella as Ferdinand). In this context some historians mention the difficulties with clear insulation of the methods and ways of each of them. Joseph Pérez, a French expert in Spanish history says it isn’t possible to analyze Isabella and Ferdinand separately, especially when it comes to the wider context in regards to this period in Spanish history. In my opinion this postulate seems to be fair only in regards to the interior policy of The Catholic Monarchs. It can’t be applied, however, to the foreign policy, especially past the year 1492. The conquest of Granada enabled Ferdinand for the first time, to focus his whole attention and energy on the international matters and Isabella’s demise in 1504, made him the only constructor of the Spanish foreign policy. After the Queen’s death, Ferdinand ruled for another 12 years, is to say until the 1516, when he himself passed away. The lack of total unity between Ferdinand and Isabella in regards to their foreign plolicy could be noticed in the African sphere. It applies both to their goals and the means of achieving them. To sum it up: Isabella’s plans in regards to Africa had the character of a crusade while Ferdinand was guided, first and foremost, by the national interest. It is also commonly known that both monarchs besides their joint abassadors, often sent those of their own, whose missions were being coded. Finally, the most important thing: Ferdinand was a symbol of the new type of politics which wasn’t either Castilian or Aragonese but Spanish.\n\nMerely a month after Isabella and Ferdinand succeeded to the Castilian throne, on January 15th 1475, the treaty of Segovia was signed. It could appear that already being Queen, Isabella would like to see Ferdiand not only as her husband and advisor but also as the true king. However, it wasn’t the case. That’s true, that some of agreements from Cervera were mitigated but Isabella’s dominant position was perserved. In regards to the basics, such as goods, pensions and posts concessions, previous agreement was maintained. When it comes to the titles that would appear on documents, coins and signs, it was agreed that it would be always joint and the name of the King would come before the name of the Queen, but the coat of arms of Castile and León would come before the one of Aragon, Sicily, etc. Only in the case of a threat that was elicted by the opposition pointed against Isabella, the Queen changed Ferdinand’s status on April 28th 1475, giving him real prerogatives which enabled them to rule jointly. Since then both, Ferdinand and Isabella had a full power in Castile. It is evident that Isabella’s decision was motivated by the difficult situation in Castile after Joanna La Beltraneja’s faction was revealed.\n\nLike we were trying to prove, Ferdinand had Aragonese value system and the Aragonese idea of Spanish unity but he quickly realized that in order to achieve his goals, Castile was crucial and thus more important. Even though at the end of the 15th century the crowns of Castile and Aragon were two main powers of the Iberian Peninsula, there was a significant imbalance between them. Castile was vaster territorialy - it constituted two-thirds of the whole Iberian Peninsula. The Crown of Aragon amounted to merely one-third of the Castilian territory. Castile was also more populous: it had six to seven millions of inhabitants while the population of Aragon, altogether with the kingdoms of Valencia and Majorca and the County of Barcelona didn’t have more than one million. On top of that, at the moment of the wedding of Isabella and Ferdinand, the Crown of Aragon was seriously impaired by the Catalonese civil war (1462-1472). Castilian economical prevalence was certainly important but when it comes to the projects of Ferdinand, the biggest asset of Castile was its way of ruling. Unlike in Aragon, where the royal power was reduced by the Cortes, Castilian king had a strong position which was good for the centralization policy. The choise of Castile was thought over, and fit into with the unification plans which were initiated by John II of Aragon with his policy in regards to Navarre. Ferdinand turned out to be a great continuer of his father’s work. He was aware that in order to unite Spain, Castile was essential because of the geopolitical situation and its potential. Hence it can be said that the union of Castile and Aragon was as much important Isabella as it was for Ferdinand, but each of them saw it differently. While Isabella’s projects were about making Aragon Castilian, Ferdinand wanted to make Castile Spanish. So in the persons of Ferdinand and his wife there were two, totally antithetical visions of their monarchy, funded by two different traditions. Their joint reign was, in fact, a titanic fight about which of those visions and traditions would win and determinate the shape of their monarchy. Given those differences, it is difficult to say that there was a full harmony during their joint reign. The character of their union, which was only dynastic, certainly didn’t make it better. Generally aside of Isabella and Ferdinand’s relationship, the both crowns were immeasurably different from each other: they had different history, different economical potential and different character of the state organization. The latter was the most important as to shape the character of their joint monarchy. In Castile there was an unitary model while in Aragon there was a federal model, which enabled each of its kingdoms to perserve their territorial and juridical independence and separate parliaments. Isabella and Ferdinand were the heirs to those two different formulas which could be noticed during their reign. When the queen was alive, the annexation of Granada was done in Castilian fashion but when, after Isabella’s death the crown of Navarre was incorporated in the Crown of Castile, it was done through a pact which guaranteed the independence in those three spheres: territorial, juridical and parliamentary. In fact, it shows that Isabella and Ferdinand created the union basing it off the differences between their kingdoms. Therefore the fact that it was not suspended at some point, causes a great astonishment and a surprise. Like it was pointed out by one historian from Edinburgh; ‘Even if we assume that the evaluation of the centralization and the effectiveness of the rule of the Catholic sovereigns is exaggerated, and that after Isabella’s death the survival of the union could seem to be in jeopardy, still, we are left with an impression that the transformation of the fragmented country into less or more united was a paradox.’\n\nIt is striking that the foreign policy of the monarchy was the main thing that cemented the union. The unity was achieved in this sphere faster, than in the others. The full internal integration of the two crowns was done under Charles I and his successors’ reigns. Hence the theory that is being promoted by the traditional historiography about the unique harmony between the both monarchs has to be challenged. Some historians say that Isabella and Ferdinand were soulmates. Quoting one of Isabella’s biographers; ‘there never were such soulmates sitting on the throne such as these of Isabella and Ferdinand.’\n\nIn fact, the harmony between them is a myth that is a part of the wider phenomen known as The Myth of The Catholic Kings created by their contemporaries, especially by Hernando de Pulgar, Diego de Valera and Juan Margarit, and which was continued in the first years of Charles I’s reign by Andrés Bernáldez, Galindez de Carvajala, Hurtado de Mendoza and others.\n\nThey wrote enthusiastically about the alleged unity between The Catholic Monarchs. Pulgar wrote like this about Isabella and Ferdinand; ‘the king and the queen were together...and despite the fact, that they were in two bodies, in their will and action, they were one.’ The same can be said for Pedro Mártir de Anglería; ‘never the philosophy in its nature discovered the harmony that would be similar to the unity between these two human beings.’ Lucio Marini on the other hand claimed; ‘Almighty God united them, so they would serve as an example of life and virtues for all the mortals(...) God sent them straight from heaven.’\n\nThe unity between the monarchs was to be, also, emphasized by their combined coat of arms: the yoke (el yugo) - Ferdinand’s sign and a bundle of arrows (un haz de flechas) - Isabella’s sign, which was put on all the emblems of the Kingdom. Isabella’s bundle of arrows joined with Ferdinand’s yoke oustrechs the picture of an open pomegranate - a ripe fruit which name reminds us of a beautiful Andalusian city: Granada.\n\nIt was customary in that era, to put above the emblems some motto, which most often would suit the social concepts. In this case, they used tanto monta (it amounts to the same), which was minted by Antonio de Nebrija in his interpretation of the Legend about Alexander The Great, bringing out the true meaning of this famous leader’s words.\n\nDuring Alexander’s visit to one of the temples in Asia Minor, they showed him an unsolvable knot, portending that if he managed to untie it, he would become the king of Asia. Then Alexander cut it with a sabre and said; ‘It amounts to the same, (cutting as untying).’\n\nThe folk tradition is said to be responsible for making such motto popular: tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando (it amounts to the same, Isabella as Ferdinand). This way the Castilian people showed their faith in the harmony between Ferdinand and Isabella, that would bring the rebirth of the Spanish Monarchy. Those spontaneous folk aspirations were also worded by the short folk song ‘Aragonese flowers inside of Castile are’ which was cited by Andrés Bernáldez in his chronicle. It was sang upon receiving the news about Isabella and Ferdinand’s wedding. Even though the Castilian magnates didn’t share the enthusiasm of the common people in this matter.”\n\nFilip Kubiaczyk\n\nAlso, the extent of power of each of them in each other’s kingdoms must be estabilished. Historians don’t agree in this matter. What’s sure is that Isabella was Queen regnant of Castile and Ferdinand was King regnant of Aragon - for they inherited their respective thrones. Isabella gave her husband power of king regnant in her kingdom like it was already mentioned, however she is usually referred to as just Ferdinand’s consort when Aragon comes to the scene:\n\n“On April 14th in 1481 Ferdinand issued a famous privilege in Calatayud, according to which Isabella was named the Deputy General of the kingdoms of Aragon. This way, she got real power in regards to the cessions concerning clergy, nobility and high posts in towns and the local administration. She could beam goods and annuities that belonged to the Crown, she also had competencies in regards to the civil and criminal jurisdiction. Seven years later, on May 30th 1488, Ferdinand had issued in Murcia another privilege which basically repeated the former prerogatives but that time there was another beneficiary, besides Isabella, their son John, born in 1478. As we can see Ferdinand’s dispositions are definitely more advantageous to Isabella from those that he himself got in Castile. However, historians don’t agree in regards to the evaluation of Ferdinand’s privileges and their effects. Antonio de la Torre and Luis Suárez believe the treaty of Segovia and the privilege from Calatayud were a parallelism of Isabella and Ferdinand’s power but Jaime Vicens Vives points out the essential difference between these both acts. According to Catalan historian, Ferdinand’s privilege from 1481 was rather an occasional act, and it was about the Cortes that would gather at the same time in Saragossa and Barcelona - given the king couldn’t be in these two places at the same time. Emilia Salvador Esteban who had examined Ferdinand’s privilege from 1488 and compared it to the treaty of Segovia, supports that notion. According to her, the treaty of Segovia was extraordinary and it came from the concrete situation, Ferdinand’s privilege, on the other hand, was characteristic for the Aragonese tradition and it could be compared to those that were being granted to heirs and viceroys. The author points out that John II was issuing such privileges in favour of Ferdinand and his wife Joanna Enríquez.\n\nWe must also distinguish two types of the governorship: general (lugarteniente general) that was always being issued in favour of an heir and particular (lugarteniente particular) that was being granted to a viceroy. Besides, as Ernest Belenguer pointed out, in 1488, the role of replacing Ferdinand didn’t belong to Isabella anymore but to their son, as a firstborn, although considering his age, Isabella perserved her position. As a matter of fact, Isabella had had less and less power in Aragon since the 90s. During Ferdinand’s permanent absence in his kingdom, the natural son of the king, Alfonso de Aragón, was his true alter ego, however in regards to the clergy, Isabella’s role was still important. In the end, Ferdinand’s power in Castile was significantly bigger than the one of isabella’s in Aragon. But maybe the matter should be put differently, namely we should ask if Isabella wanted to have similar rights in Aragon to such of Ferdinand’s in Castile. I think that she didn’t. Isabella hadn’t been particularly interested in the matters of Aragon from the very beginning, even though she owed so much to the Crown. It can be said the Queen didn’t understand the structures of the Crown of Aragon and it seems she even abhored them. The Castilian tendency to centralism didn’t let her accept the federal model of governance. Francesco Guicciardini wrote that Isabella had said in 1481, during her visit to Aragon: ‘Aragon isn’t ours (Castilian) so it’s necessary for us to conquer it once again.’”\n\nSources: (x), “Między wojną a dyplomacją.
