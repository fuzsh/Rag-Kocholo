        "text": "Hi to all the members!!\n\nThis is my third thread, so I was wondering about who could be the topic, so I just think: the heirs of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabel and Fernando.\n\nAccording to history, the wife of Juan Prince of Asturias, born Archduchess Margaret of Austria, was heavily pregnant with her husband's posthumous child when he died on 4 October 1497. On 2 April 1498 at Alcalá de Henares, the Dowager Princess of Asturias, probably distressed by her husband's demise, gave birth a daughter who died at birth.\n\nNow, the thread began with this topic: what if this child survives.......\n\n____________________________________​\n\nFollowing the funerals of the Prince of Asturias and his burial at the Royal Monastery of Saint Thomas in Ávila in October 1497, the royal physicians advised to his devastated parents that for the sake of the Dowager Princess and her unborn child, she must to rest in a better climate. They chose Alcalá de Henares, where Margaret stayed for the rest of her pregnancy.\n\nAfter suffering strong hemorrhages during late-March and early-April 1498, the Dowager Princess' health was constantly monitored by the physicians, who recommended that Margaret must be in bed for the rest of the pregnancy for her sake and the future of Castile and Aragon who was in her womb.\n\nFinally, in the early hours of 24 April 1498, all the bells of the churches and cathedrals of Castile rang during hours: after an extremely difficult ordeal, the Dowager Princess of Asturias gave birth a daughter, who, thanks to the care of the physicians, was born healthy.\n\nQueen Isabel, who since the death of her son wore mourning clothes, was overjoy: God take us our good prince, but send this little princess, who now had the place of her father in our hearts.\n\nAlthough dissapointed by the gender of his grandchild, King Fernando was also satisfied with this birth, who secured the succession of the unified Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon.\n\nThe name of the child was already discussed and determined since months ago: if was a boy, he would be named Juan; if is a girl, the feminine variation of the name, Juana.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\nTwo months later, on 19 June, Princess Juana was baptized at Burgos Cathedral in a magnificent ceremony, presided by the King and Queen and officiated by Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain. As godparents, where chosen Manuel and Isabel (eldest child of the Catholic Monarchs), the King and Queen of Portugal. The baby, who wore garments made in gold and silver, was hold in the baptismal font by her grandmother Queen Isabel.\n\nThe Dowager Princess of Asturias, although still weak for her childbirth, was able to attend the baptism and proudly sitted next to her parents-in-law.\n\nRepresentatives of Emperor Maximilian and Archduke Philip of Austria (maternal grandfather and uncle of the newborn, respectively) were the first who paid homage to the Princess, kissing her golden long train while still being hold by her grandmother.\n\nBy command of the Queen, one day later (20 June), Princess Juana was sworn Princess of Asturias and legitimate heiress of the Kingdom of Castile. The Castilian Cortes agreed inmediately and paid homage to their future sovereign; however, King Fernando, although happy for the event, was worried about the intransigent of the Aragonese Cortes, who always were against to permit a female ruler. Once the ceremony ended, the Catholic Monarchs parted to Zaragoza, and called the Cortes to discuss the proclamation of their granddaughter as heiress of Aragon.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED........\n\nKing Fernando and Queen Isabel arrived to Zaragoza on 17 July 1498, after a lenghty journey, mostly because the King wanted to enter in the city only after being well informed of the situation who developed there.\n\nThe Cortes were formally opened the next day (18 July) and then began the discussions. The major Aragonese noble families -including the prestigious lineages of Alagón, Azlor, Bardaxi, Calasanz, Cornel, Eril and Fortuñones (all distantly related with the King- wanted to preserve the ancient customs of the Kingdom of Aragon and refused to recognized Princess Juana as heiress of Aragon.\n\nAnother heated topic during the Cortes was the government of the Kingdom in the case that the King goes to our Creator with a minor heir: they strongly refused to agreed with the Regency of the Dowager Princess of Asturias, because she was a foreigner and until then never visit Aragon, so she didn't understood and probably either respect, the local administration, customs, fueros (statutes) and liberties of the Kingdom.\n\nQueen Isabel (who already had obtained from the Castilian Cortes the consent with a co-regency of both Fernando and Margaret -with a council of nobles- in the case of her early death), was furious with the too much independent ways of the Aragonese Cortes: apparently, they forgot who was their King....the word of the sovereign is law, but this people disrespect this, the Queen bitterly remarked.\n\nThe Aragonese Cortes strongly supported the candidacy of Alonso of Aragon, bastard of King Fernando and Archbishop of Zaragoza, as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom in the case of the King's death. This infuriated Queen Isabel: was widely known that although she tolerated her husband's debauchery, she detested the bastards of the King.\n\nThe Queen was ready to use the force if was necessary, in order to obtain from the Aragonese the recognition of her granddaughter's rights and the regency for Margaret: the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Girona, despite her youth, already showed a good political knowledge, and with the proper help of the nobility, she could made an excellent role.\n\nAfter almost twelve days of discussions, on 30 July the King and the Cortes made an agreement, much to the Queen's dismay: Margaret of Austria would be Regent of the Kingdom of Aragon, but with the assistance and advice of Archbishop Alonso, who became in the Guardian of the Throne until Princess Juana came on age to assume government.\n\nPrincess Juana was sworn Princess of Girona, Duchess of Montblanc, Countess of Cervera and Lady of Balaguer (the traditional titles of the heir of the Kingdom of Aragon) at La Seo Cathedral on 1 August 1498; because she was absent at that moment, the oath was taken by King Fernando in her name, and was decided that the Princess would be present to sworn the fueros of the Kingdom in her 5th birthday, in 1503.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.......\n\nJust a few days after the proclamation of Princess Juana as heiress of Castile and Aragon, another tragedy took place for the Catholic Monarchs: their oldest daughter, Queen Isabel of Portugal, died in Coimbra on 23 August 1498 after giving birth a son, Miguel da Paz.\n\nThe whole Castilian court entered in a strict mourning period, following the Queen's orders. King Manuel, although mildly consternated by the death of his wife, was more worried about the political consequences that this loss had for him and his Kingdom: with the death of Prince Juan and the uncertainty of his succession, he was openly confident that his wife would be the next in line to inherited Castile and Aragon; however, the safely birth of Princess Juana destroyed his hopes, and now put him in a difficult position with his former parents-in-law.\n\nOnly two months later, in mid-October 1498, arrived to the Castilian court (who at that time was in Granada) a proposal who, although was quite interesting, caused astonishment to the King and Queen: the Portuguese monarch proposed that his newborn son, Miguel, would be betrothed with his first-cousin Juana, and thus the whole Iberia Peninsula would be united under their rule.\n\nKing Ferdinand saw in this engagement the culmination of his policies: the unification of the Kingdoms of Castile, Aragon and Portugal under the rule of his grandchildren, and thus he readily agreed with it; Queen Isabel, by the other hand, was worried about the real purpose of Manuel behind this betrothal: Portugal would absorve both Castile and Aragon, because Juana, as Queen consort, had to life in her new country with her husband, and in consequence the Kingdoms must to be governed by proxies, a fact that she strongly resented.\n\nA ruler must to live with their subjects, because then she knew their concerns, their worries, their lives, the Queen say.\n\nThe negociations for the betrothal were slowed by the Queen, despite the oposition of her husband: only in mid-March 1499 King Ferdinand finally convinced his consort to agreed with the union.\n\nThe betrothal between Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal and Juana, Princess of Asturias and Girona, was signed in Burgos on 12 April 1499. The papal dispensation (because they are first-cousins) was obtained a few months later, in September.\n\nIn the contract was stipulated that the wedding must to take place when both Miguel reached his 14th birthday, in 1512. Was also determined that the couple would six months in Portugal, while the other six months they resided in Castile and Aragon.\n\nQueen Isabel wasn't sure about this: she feared that once her beloved granddaughter became in Princess of Portugal, she was forbidden to return to her domains, so she insisted several times that King Manuel made an oath under which he promised that he would respect the terms of the marriage contract.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.......\n\nDuring all the political maneuvres who taken place since her birth, Princess Juana spend her first years of life in the splendid Alhambra royal palace complex in Granada, with her own household and under the constant supervision of her mother and grandparents.\n\nSince early childhood, the Princess showed an extreme intelligence and most important, she had a strong-willed determination. An eager reader since her 3rd birthday, soon began the high-profiled education proper of her future sovereignity: mathematics, geography, latin and foreign languages, but also she was educated in the feminine ways of the 16th century: embroidery, dancing, and court etiquette.\n\nAn avid student, Juana quickly developed a life-long love for books. The Catholic Monarchs decided that their heiress' education had to be exactly as careful and complex as was their late son Prince Juan: Fray Diego Deza (the later Grand Inquisitor of Spain) taught her the principles of Theology, while the Italian humanist Peter Martyr d'Anghiera took in charge the rest of the Princess' education.\n\nIn addition, the Princess showed her passion for hunting and falconry, sharing this taste with her grandfather King Ferdinand, who since 1502 took her in short hunt expeditions and also teach her horse riding, in which she later became a master (later chronicles stated that Juana ride horses like a man).\n\nQueen Isabel, worried about the health of the Princess, ordened that the royal physicians visited her every weekend, and gave to her a meticulous report; they always say that in difference to her late father, the Princess of Asturias had a vitality and strong health far from her age.\n\nThe Princess had for her amusement a group of children who play with her, all daughters of nobles, her best friend and principal lady-in-waiting was Luisa de Cabrera (later Marchioness of Moya and Duchess consort of Escalona), granddaughter of Beatriz de Bobadilla, in turn confidant and close friend of the Queen.\n\nThe wardrobe of the Princess was also carefully monitored: every year, Juana changed all her dresses, in a combined Castilian-German fashion (probably under the influence of her mother). As a birthday gift, the Catholic Monarchs gave their granddaughter impressive jewelry (despite her tender age) and a monetary amount, whom she gave to charity, adviced by the Dowager Princess of Asturias.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\nFollowing the politics of approaching to Castile and Portugal, and despite the already signed betrothal between his son and the Princess of Asturias, King Manuel I of Portugal decided to ask the hand of the eldest unmarried daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Infanta Maria, as a wife.\n\nAfter the papal dispensation due to affinity (Manuel was to marry the sister of his late wife) arrived in mid-August 1500, the Infanta made her trip to Portugal, marrying with King Manuel at the district of Alcácer do Sal in Setúbal on 30 October. Two years later, in 1502 the new Queen of Portugal gave birth the first of her ten children, a son, named João, Duke of Coimbra. Reportedly, was a happy marriage.\n\nThe other two daughters of the Catholic Monarchs, Juana and Catalina, had very different lifes in their new homelands:\n\nJuana, Archduchess of Austria and Consort to the ruler of the Netherlands (who included several titles: Duchess consort of Brabant, Limburg and Lothier, Duchess consort of Luxemburg, Margravine consort of Namur, Countess consort of Artois and Flanders, Countess consort of Charolais, Countess consort of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland and Countess consort of Burgundy) had to suffer the constant infidelity and disdain of her husband, Philip the Handsome, son and heir of Emperor Maximilian I and brother of the Dowager Princess of Asturias. Despite had giving birth three children at that point -Eleanor in 1498, Charles in 1500 and Isabella in 1501-, the mental instability of the Archduchess (probably inherited from her maternal grandmother, Isabel of Portugal, Queen of Castile) increased considerably due to her husband's debauchery. The Dowager Princess of Asturias received several letters from her brother where he described the attacks of fury of his wife, and because of this he was forced to locked her several times for the sake of my children and court.\n\nCatalina, Dowager Princess of Wales since the death in April 1502 of her husband Arthur, remained at Durham House in London as a virtual prisoner; some of the letters she wrote to her parents are basically about complaints of the mistreatment she suffered from her father-in-law King Henry VII of England, and the lack of money that she had, moreover because was her duty to support her ladies-in-waiting.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.......\n\nAccording to the previous requests of the Aragonese Cortes, Princess Juana was sworn Princess of Girona in person at La Seo Cathedral on 17 July 1503. At the ceremony attended the Catholic Monarchs, the Dowager Princess of Asturias and a group of castilian nobles, much to the dismay of Archbishop Alonso of Zaragoza, who adviced his father not to showed his likeness over this people in front of his loyal subjects. The Aragonese nobility was satisfied with their King finally presented their future sovereign, and they became overjoyed: Juana showed such determination, steadiness and vivacity that she conquer the heart of Archbishop Alonso and the rest of the Aragonese main noble families.\n\nPrincess Juana showed an extreme fancy over the Kingdom of Aragon: reportedly, she asked her grandparents to made a tour over the main Aragonese cities. Archbishop Alonso, with the consent of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel, leaded the entourage of the Princess in Aragon. In mid-July 1503 Juana and her mother began a trip to the cities of Épila, Daroca, Caspe, Tortosa, Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona (the city of her title as heiress and reportedly the favorite one of the Princess), Ampurias, Urgel, Balaguer, Lérida and Caspe, returning to Zaragoza in December at the urging of the Catholic Monarchs, who remained there because of the delicate health of the Queen.\n\nIn all the cities and villages she visited, the Princess of Girona was acclaimed with enthusiasm and joy; even her late father never received such demostrations of love and homage, wrote Archbishop Alonso to his father the King.\n\nQueen Isabel, whose health wasn't good since the death of her beloved son, after the return to Castile in mid-January 1504 suffered a complete decline. Knowing that she was dying, her last efforts where to secure a pacified succession to her beloved granddaughter, to who she always called Mi pequeño angel (Mi little angel) in honor to her late son.\n\nAfter months of fever, faints and convulsions, Queen Isabel officially withdrew from governmental affairs on 14 September 1504 and retired to the Royal Palace at Medina del Campo, known later as the Palacio Testamentario (Testamentary Palace), because was there were she redacted and signed her last requests and testament on 12 October of that year in scriptis (in secret).\n\nIsabel I, Queen regnant of Castile and Queen consort of Aragon, conqueror of Granada and the most mighty and powerful monarch of the Christendom, died at Medina del Campo on 26 November 1504.\n\nIn her will, she detailed her succession without doubt:\n\nOtrosí, conformándose con lo que debo y soy obligada de derecho, ordeno y establezco e instituyo por universal heredera de todos mis Reynos, e Tierras, e Señoríos, e de todos mis bienes rayces, después de mis días, a la Ilustrísima Doña Juana, Princesa de Asturias e de Gerona, mi muy cara, e muy amada nieta, primogénita, heredera e sucesora legítima de los dichos mis Reynos e Tierras e Señoríos; la cual luego que Dios me llevare, se intitule Reyna.\n\nConforming with what I have and I am obliged in law, ordened and instituted universal heiress of all my kingdoms, and lands, and lordships, and all my goods, after my days at the most graceful Lady Juana, Princess of Asturias and Girona, my very dear, and beloved grandddaughter, first-born heiress and legitimate successor of these my kingdoms and lordships; which after God take me to his side, take the title of Queen.\n\nFollowing her request, she was buried at the Royal vault at Granada next to her husband, but if he decided to be buried in other place, then she must to be inhumated and buried where he decided.\n\nDuring the minority of the new Queen (who would ended in her 18th birthday, in 1516, or previously if she marry) was established the co-regency of the widower King Ferdinand and Margaret, Dowager Princess of Asturias.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\nQueen Juana I of Castile was sworn sovereign by the Burgos Cortes on 11 December 1504, and a solemn mass where took place at the Church of Saint Michael in Segovia (the same place where her grandmother took the title of Queen in 1474) on 15 January 1505, where the new Queen was blessed and received the crown from her grandfather.\n\nThe new Queen resided with her household and court at the beautiful Royal Alcázar of Sevilla, where she spend the first years of her reign.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.....\n\nThe co-regency between King Fernando II of Aragon and Margaret, Dowager Princess of Asturias and Girona over Castile officially lasted since the death of Queen Isabel, in 1504, until the marriage of Queen Juana I with Prince Miguel of Portugal, in 1513.\n\nThe first years of government were completely absorbed by the Aragonese King, despite the oposition of Emperor Maximilian I of Austria (who believed that the political postergation of his daughter eventually would be detrimental to his own politics) and the local nobility, who believed that the King-Regent only served from the Castilian funds for his Italian pretensions and the conquest of the Kingdom of Navarra, following the politics of his late father King Juan II of Aragon (who ruled that country as consort of his first wife Queen Blanca I and later as a sovereign ruler, displacing his own son, the famous Carlos, Prince of Viana).\n\nIn 1508, King Fernando II began the open war in Italy, this time against the Republic of Venice, forming the League of Cambrai with all the other sovereigns who had interests on the Italian peninsula, including King Louis XII of France, Emperor Maximilian I, and Pope Julius II.\n\nAlthough the French were victorious against Venice at the Battle of Agnadello (14 May 1509), soon the League fell apart, as both the Pope and King Fernando II became extremely suspicious of the real intentions of Louis XII (who as the grandson and legitimate heir of Valentina Visconti, claimed the Duchy of Milan). Instead, the 'Holy League' was formed, in which now all the powers joined together against Louis XII and France.\n\nIn Castile, Emperor Maximilian I had an strong support and confidant in his daughter Margaret, who in her quality as mother of the Queen, soon began to formed a group of nobles known as the la Camarilla Austriaca (the Austrian clique), who believed that the Dowager Princess of Asturias had to be the sole Regent of the Kingdom.\n\nThe first political goal of the Dowager Princess was to had to her side the powerful Cardinal Cisneros, Great Inquisidor of Castile and confesor of the late Queen Isabel. The Cardinal soon developed the idea of a Council of Regency on behalf of the little Queen, jointly presided by him and Margaret, and stripped completely all his power and privileges to King Fernando II.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\nEmperor Maximilian I, in the view of the political situation that the Aragonese King had to faced in Castile, retired from the League of Cambrai in March 1510 and made a double pact with the Republic of Venice and Pope Julius II, under which the Emperor promised to protect the Papal States from any invasion. In response, Fernando II made a treaty with Louis XII, under which he recognized the Visconti rights of the French King and effectively support his invasion to the Duchy of Milan, then ruled by the Sforzas, and the Papal States.\n\nBy July 1510, the new Veneto-Austrian-Papal alliance was on the offensive; a joint force commanded by Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, captured Modena on 17 August. Julius II now excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, thus justifying an attack on the Duchy itself; in anticipation of his coming victory, the Pope traveled to Bologna, so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken.\n\nThe French army, however, had been left unopposed by the Swiss (who, having arrived in Lombardy, had been bribed into leaving by Louis) and was free to march south into the heart of Italy. In early October, Charles II d'Amboise advanced on Bologna; by 18 October, he was only a few miles from the city. Julius II now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French; left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry, he resorted to excommunicating d'Amboise, who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara.\n\nIn December, a newly assembled Papal army conquered Concordia and, in December, besieged the fortress of Mirandola; d'Amboise, marching to relieve the latter, fell ill and died, briefly leaving the French in disarray. Mirandola fell in January 1511, the Pope having taken personal command of the assault; but d'Amboise had been replaced by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, who took back Concordia and Castelfranco, while the Papal army retreated to Casalecchio.\n\nAlfonso d'Este, meanwhile, with the help of Louis XII confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the Po River, leaving Bologna isolated once more. Julius II, afraid of being trapped by the French, departed the city for Ravenna. Cardinal Alidosi, whom he left behind to command the defense of the city, was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius II himself had been; and when, on 23 May 1511, a French army commanded by Trivulzio arrived at the gates, they quickly surrendered. Julius II blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino, who, finding this quite unfair, proceeded to murder Alidosi in full view of the Papal guard.\n\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\nAt this point, Fernando II was forced to retreat from the Italian affairs, thanks to the intrigues of his daughter-in-law, who aimed by her father and the Castilian nobility, called the Cortes at Burgos (16 June 1511) and with the support of the majority of the nobles and backed by Cisneros, declared herself Governadora y Curatrix de la Corona de Castilla (Governor and Curatrix of the Crown of Castile) with full powers over the government.\n\nThe Aragonese King, once knew that his power over Castile was in serious jeopardy, reacted quickly: on the night of 24-25 June, a contigent leaded by Archbishop Alonso of Zaragoza besieged and captured the Royal Alcázar of Sevilla, taking the 13-years-old Queen with them.\n\nThe news of the kidnapping of the Queen was a complete shock for both Cisneros and Margaret. Riots erupted in all the Kingdom, and voices between the nobles adviced the Dowager Princess to raise an army to rescue the Queen, who was in her way to Aragon following the orders of Fernando II.\n\nAn army leaded by Fadrique Enríquez de Velasco, Admiral of Castile and Bernardino Fernández de Velasco y Mendoza, Duke of Frías (known as the Grand Condestable and one of the most powerful and respected castilian nobles) leave Burgos and pursued the Aragonese army who took the Queen.\n\nThe castilian troops finally reached the aragonese forces in the city of Cuenca, being confronted in the Battle of Villanueva de los Escuderos (10 July 1511); the fight, despite the audacity and experience of Archbishop Alonso, was winned by the Castilians, thanks to the unexpected support of the local villagers, who joined the troops of the Admiral and Duke Bernardino.\n\nArchbishop Alonso, wounded in the battle, was captured, while the Queen, in a carriage next to the battlefield, remained calm, comforting her terrified ladies-in-waiting.\n\nDuke Bernardino (despite being a brother-in-law of Alonso), gave a harsh treatment to the Archbishop, who with his main collaborators was translated to Burgos.\n\nKing Fernando II, horrified about the destiny of his beloved son, threatened with an open war against the Dowager Princess and Cisneros, in order to defend his rights and privileges given to him in the last will of the Queen my wife.\n\nThe situation was on the verge of a civil war, but was the Dowager Princess who decided to be the conciliatory part.\n\nA meeting between Margaret and Fernando II was arranged in Molina, where the Treaty of Molina was signed (27 July 1511) under which was determined:\n\nThe inmediate liberation of Archbishop Alonso and his men.\n\nFernando II kept the title of King-Regent of Castile with a limited participation in the government affairs.\n\nThe Dowager Princess agreed to shared the joint custody of the Queen, who would spend at least five months of the year in Aragon.\n\nThe Castilian Treasure still continue to support the political ambitions of the Aragonese Kingdom, if he sworn to solemnly respect the above mentioned terms of the Treaty.\n\nThe Treaty was considered a big triumph for both the Dowager Princess and Cisneros; defeated, Fernando II retired to Aragon, concentrating his efforts in the conquest of Navarra, and with another purpose in mind: the search of a second wife who could bear him a son and heir.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED....."
