        "text": "I have both because work pays for DSL, but on the comment of Cable being faster, I think it depends on your DSL Options, I have embarq and have the 10.0M download / 896k upload speed, but only have 7M download/ 384k upload with Cable.\n\nWe've used (2) service providers before, mainly for increased speed and also as a connection backup. The router we use for this is made by Nexland (a company that was bought by Symantec a number of years ago, and the router was then branded under their name.)\n\nThe router has connections for dual service providers and you can choose to have the bandwidth \"bonded\" for higher speed, set it up so if one goes down the other continues on as a backup, etc."
