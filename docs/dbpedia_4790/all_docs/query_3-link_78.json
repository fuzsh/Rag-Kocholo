        "text": "Tornado Network Services Belgium\n\nDuring the last few years, Tornado Belgium extended not only its product-range but also its number of dealers. This by distributing its products to different channels such as the most popular Retail-chains, famous Value Added Resellers in IT and Telecom a\n\nJoris Vinckx created Tornado Belgium on 1st April 1990 at Rillaar with a starting-capital of 750.000 BEF. After 2 years a fundraise of 1 million BEF was achieved. Its core business was to distribute Tornado modems for Belgium and Luxembourg. This product range was extended with computer accessories and scanners from Primax, Tamarack, Addison and Logitech.In the beginning of 1995, Tornado Belgium took a participation in Route 64, that offers a wide range of ISDN solutions with partners such as AVM, Motorola and Gandalf. In June 1995, Tornado Belgium moved to its own new building located at the industrial site in Aarschot. At that time, Tornado Belgium integrated Internet solutions in his datacom offer. Within two years Tornado became one of the TOP 3 Internet Service Providers in Belgium. With 27 POPs (Point of Presence) and 5 International links, Tornado Internet guaranteed a fast ride on the Internet Highway. Due to this geographical coverage the access to Internet was guaranteed for Europe, USA, Japan and Asia. Tornado Internet counted over 7000 Internet subscribers.Beside analogue modem access, Tornado Belgium also offered ISDN connections in all his POPs. Other Internet services offered were: Leased Lines, Web-housing, Small-Office solutions and Intranet. At the end of 1997, Tornado Belgium sold its Internet department to the companies Ping and EUnet, with whom Tornado Belgium is still working together.From 1998 on, Tornado Belgium concentrated again on its core business; the distribution of Tornado modems, computer accessories and scanners of different brands. Addison, AVM, Primax, Wisecom, EUnet/Ping, Netopia and Allied Data Technology are Tornado`s partners who help Tornado Belgium to offer quality products and an excellent service to its approximately 1.500 customers. Co-operation with new partners such as Nexland and ADS proves Tornado Belgium is following closely the newest developments in the world of hardware.During the last few years, Tornado Belgium extended not only its product-range but also its number of dealers. This by distributing its products to different channels such as the most popular Retail-chains, famous Value Added Resellers in IT and Telecom and about 800 PC shops. Thanks to the strengthening of its services and the further extension of its product range, Tornado Belgium grows stronger as a distributor of mainly datacom- and network-products, more dynamic than ever."
