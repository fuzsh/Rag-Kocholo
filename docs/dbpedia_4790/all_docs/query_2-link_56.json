There is no installation required, just download and run as administrator.\n\nThe program can aid both the novice and the advanced user in tweaking related TCP/IP parameters in Windows, making it easy to tune your system to the type of Internet connection used. The tool uses advanced algorithms, and the bandwidth*delay product to find the best TCP Window for your specific connection speed. It provides for easy tuning of all related TCP/IP parameters, such as MTU, RWIN, and even advanced ones like QoS and ToS/Diffserv prioritization. The program works with all current versions of Windows, and includes additional tools, such as testing average latency over multiple hosts, and finding the largest possible packet size (MTU).\n\nThe TCP Optimizer is targeted towards broadband internet connections, however it can be helpful with tuning any internet connection type, from dialup to Gigabit+ :) It is completely free, works with most Windows versions from XP to Windows 11, requires no installation, and has been downloaded over 10 Million times over the years.\n\nIf you need help with the program, check the TCP Optimizer documentation, read our broadband tweaking articles, the Optimizer FAQ, and/or visit our Forums. The program can be freely (re)distributed, as long as you give us proper credit as the author, and it is not sold for profit.\n\nTCP Optimizer Download:\n\nTCP Optimizer 4 (latest stable official SG release, works with all current Windows versions)\n\nTCP Optimizer Download Mirrors:\n\nSpeedGuide.net (latest version, recommended)\n\nMajorGeeks.com\n\nDownload.com\n\nSoftpedia.com\n\nCHIP Online (German) version 4,\n\nGIGA Software (German)\n\nOS: Windows 9x/ME/2K/XP/2000/Vista/7/2008/8/10/22/2012 Server/2019 Server version: 4.1.1 date: 2021-01-08 file size: 668 KB\n\nLegacy Versions:\n\nTCP Optimizer v. 3.08 (deprecated, supports versions up to Windows 7/2008 Server, does not support Windows 8/10/2012)\n\nTCP Optimizer v. 2.03 (deprecated, unsupported, released 01/06/2006, supports versions up to Windows XP)\n\nTCP Optimizer v. 1.00 (deprecated, unsupported)\n\nDonations:\n\nThe TCP Optimizer software is completely free to use and distribute.

Note that if you're using the TCP Optimizer program, there is no need to apply any of those registry patches, as they modify the same parameters. You should really experiment with different settings and add them manually or using our TCP Optimizer program above rather than applying generic patches, however we've added them for simplicity, ease of installation and the many requests. Please make sure you download the patch for your version of Windows, they are slightly different. If you'd rather try editing the Registry yourself, check the Registry Tweaks section of the site, or use our TCP Optimizer program.\n\nNote: All patches are compressed and downloadable in \"zip\" format. You might need an utility, such as WinZip or WinRAR to uncompress the downloaded files before installation.\n\nsguide_tweak_9x.zip\n\nDescription: Generic Registry patch for Windows 95/98/98SE/ME (includes a fix for 98SE ICS, as well as corrected SackOpts location).

By default, when a DNS lookup fails (due to temporary DNS problems), Windows still caches the unsuccessful DNS query, and in turn fails to connect to a host regardless of the fact that the DNS server might be able to handle your lookup seconds later. This patch fixes the problem by configuring the DNS client to continue sending queries to an unresponsive network.

For example, imagine a web page has 20 images and some text - in order for your browser to get all these files, it opens 2 or 4 concurrent connections, depending on the Web server. Increasing the number of open connections allows for faster retrieving of the data. Please note that the patch sets some values outside of the HTML specs. If you decide to install it, backup your Registry first. Changes will take effect after you reboot.
