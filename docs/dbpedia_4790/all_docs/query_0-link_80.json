        "text": "Written By:\n\nDate Posted: September 18, 2002\n\nIn today's world of increased computer use, households on average now have at least 2 computers. Internet access has almost become a necessity, and broadband is now more popular than ever. Yet how is one to distribute a connection between the computers in one's household? The simple answer is to get a router and use ipmasq to create an internal network. A myriad of companies have come out with routers - Linksys, Dlink, Netgear, etc. but have their routers been safe? Nexland steps up to the plate, proudly providing the ever-popular Alienware with routers, and the claim that their routers are in fact secure and safe.\n\nThe router itself is unlike any I have seen as of yet in its aesthetic design.\n\nOn the back, there are 4 dip switches (very small switches originally more commonly seen on older motherboards for settings,) that allow a user to clear the memory if positioned in the correct sequence. There have been times in which a user may forget a password, but may need to change his settings - this type of failsafe is very important in that case, since the reset button does not clear the routers' memory.\n\nThere is then 1 port for the WAN - Wide Area Network, the connection to the Internet. Therefore the 4 ports on the back of the router are the LAN - the Local Area Network. Finally there is a reset button, and the power source.\n\nLet's see what else comes with the router:\n\n- 6.5 feet of Category (CAT) 5 cabling\n\n- A CD with the Manual, Utilities, and Internet Explorer 5.5\n\n- A Printed Manual\n\n- The power adapter\n\n- A Quick-Start Guide\n\nThe major features include:\n\n- Up to 253 clients on the network\n\n- Solid firewall protection\n\n- A built in 4 port 10/100 switch to connect computers or hubs\n\n- Over 8 Megabits of High-Speed Bi-Directional Throughput\n\n- Gaming optimizations for multi-player games behind NAPT\n\n- Easy configuration via web\n\n- IPsec Pass-Through for telecommuters\n\n- Dynamic DNS capabilities for web servers\n\n- DMZ Host capabilities\n\nSome of that stuff might have gone over your head - that's perfectly fine. The first thing I want to point out is that the ports on the back of the unit are part of a switch, not a hub. What's the difference? Both switches and hubs allow for a connection to be repeated and re-distributed to other computers. There are 2 standards for speeds - which you have is dependant upon your network cards' capabilities: 10baseT and 100baseT. The 10 and 100 represent how many Megabits can be transferred per second. Please do not confuse a Megabit with a Megabyte."
