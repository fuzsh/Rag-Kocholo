        "text": "Opening a port on your router is the same thing as creating a Port Forward. These open ports allow connections through your firewall to your home network. Creating a port forward is common in gaming, security cameras, torrenting, and home automation.\n\nThe easiest way to forward a port is to use our Network Utilities software. Network Utilities automatically forwards your ports for you. Get your ports forwarded right now with our software. Save time with Network Utilities so you can get back to your game or whatever it is that you want to be doing.\n\nNetwork Utilities Software by Port Forward\n\nSave Time - Let our software forward ports for you.\n\nIncrease Security - Turn forwarded ports on or off with a button.\n\nOptimize Your Router - Manage your port forwards.\n\nGet faster, more reliable connections by port forwarding with Network Utilities.\n\nGet Started Now\n\nList of Routers\n\nThe following guides show all of the necessary steps to port forwarding applications such as Minecraft, PlayStation, uTorrent, and Xbox.\n\nStart by downloading our Network Utilities software.\n\nFor more guides about setting up your router, visit SetupRouter.com.\n\nSelect your router from the list of manufacturers\n\nTo get to a guide that is specific to your router, you will need to first select your router's manufacturer from the list and then click on your router's model.\n\nFor more information about port forwarding visit our Ultimate Guide to Port Forwarding Your Router.\n\nUse a VPN Instead\n\nHave you considered using a VPN instead of forwarding a port? For most users, a VPN is a much simpler and more secure choice than forwarding a port.\n\nWe use and recommend NordVPN because not only is it the fastest VPN, it includes a new feature called Meshnet that makes forwarding a port no longer necessary for most applications. With NordVPN Meshnet, you can connect to your devices from anywhere in the world, completely secure, over a highly encrypted VPN tunnel."
