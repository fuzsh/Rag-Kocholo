        "text": "Desertworld Theme and Water Park is an amusement park in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is owned and operated by Carwardine Parks. It opened in 1999.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOn September 4th, 1995, the original Desertworld closed after the 1995 season but it didn't reopen for the 1996 season.\n\nIn late 1996, Carwardine Parks tried to save the park by purchasing the park, but it was too late. The park was about to be gone for good.\n\nAfter failing to purchase the old park, Carwardine had plans to build a new park based on the Desertworld name instead. They decided that the park at the new Desertworld's location would be called Desertworld Theme and Water Park.\n\nIn early 1998, construction of the new park began.\n\nOn May 22nd, 1999, the new park had its grand opening.\n\nAfter delays in construction, on Memorial Day 2000, Lightnin' Twins opened.\n\nFor the 2001 season, Lightnin' Twins was reprofiled in order to prevent it from valleying and also to conserve electricity. The white track's inverting top hat was lowered from 139 feet to only 115 feet; although, if you look closely, the original track still exists and is visible through some supports. In addition, a power backup generator was purchased from a closed-down Sears store, solely to be used for the coaster, in order to allow the ride to duel as intended.\n\nOn August 24, 2001, a Vekoma Giant Inverted Boomerang called Twin Towers was announced to open in 2002. However, following the 9/11 attacks less than 3 weeks later, the park swiftly announced that the coaster would be named Insanity instead.\n\nIn 2003, PBS Kids Neighborhood opened. The park also announced at the end of the season that the Desertworld Fun Fair area would be rethemed and renamed to Disaster Alley for the 2004 season.\n\nIn 2004, Desert Storm opened. That same year, it was announced that Cobra would permanently close on July 30th due to multiple maintenance issues, complaints of roughness, and an overall very low ridership. The ride would be scrapped, with parts sent to TOGO's other looping coasters around the world.\n\nIn 2005, Super Cobra opened on Cobra's former spot.\n\nIn the same year, it was announced that K'Nex World would be rethemed and renamed to WOOHP Universe after Carwardine Parks purchased the rights to Totally Spies for the parks.\n\nIn 2023, Tumbleweed opened to the public.\n\nAreas[]\n\nEntrance\n\nAction Central\n\nAmerican Avenue\n\nConey Island\n\nDisaster Alley (formerly known as “Desertworld Fun Fair” [1999-2003])\n\nKids Kountry (formerly known as \"PBS Kids Neighborhood\" [2003-2007])\n\nSilly Safari\n\nWOOHP Universe (formerly known as “K'Nex Land” [1999-2005])\n\nCurrent rides & attractions[]\n\nRoller coasters[]\n\nName Opening Year Color Scheme Area Q-X Passport Note Desert Storm 2004 Dark brown track and black supports Disaster Alley Yes A B&M Floorless Coaster with the same layout as Medusa at Six Flags Great Adventure.
