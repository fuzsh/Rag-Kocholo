        "text": "This book re-conceptualises teaching through an engagement with Jean-Paul Sartre’s early existentialist thought. It builds upon Sartre’s key concepts related to the self, freedom, bad faith, and the Other to open up ways of thinking about the practices of teaching.\n\nAlison will talk through the main ideas in the book and what it aims to achieve, followed by discussion with Áine Mahon (University College Dublin) and Alexis Gibbs (University of Winchester).\n\nThis in-person event will be particularly useful for philosophers of education, education practitioners and those interested in existentialism.\n\nPESGB seminar series\n\nThis event is part of the Philosophy of Education Society of Great Britain (PESGB) seminar series. PESGB is a learned society that promotes the study, teaching and application of philosophy of education. Its London Branch hosts seminars every Wednesday in conjunction with the Centre for Philosophy of Education. These seminars are led by national and international scholars in the field, covering a wide range of issues of educational and philosophical concern.\n\nAll are welcome to attend.\n\nRelated links"
