        "text": "(1905–80). One of the leading exponents of existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre was also well known as a writer. He expressed his dedication to his philosophy both in what he wrote and in the way he lived his life.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre was born on June 21, 1905, in Paris, France. In 1919 he graduated from the École Normale Supérieure, where he met his lifelong companion, the writer Simone de Beauvoir. Between 1931 and 1945 he taught at several secondary schools in France. During the 1930s he began to develop his existentialist philosophy, which stressed personal freedom and stated that the individual exists only in relation to other people. In 1938 he published his first major work, the novel ‘Nausea’, in which he set these ideas in writing.\n\nIn 1939 Sartre was drafted to serve in World War II. He was captured and placed in a prisoner-of-war camp in 1940, but he escaped the following year and returned to Paris, where he became active in the Resistance. After the war Sartre became a celebrity. His writings began to focus on the necessity for action, or doing, rather than simply existing. This led to an increased commitment to politics. In 1945 Sartre cofounded with de Beauvoir a monthly review of politics, philosophy, and art called Les Temps Modernes. In 1952 Sartre allied himself with the French Communist party, though he never actually became a member."
