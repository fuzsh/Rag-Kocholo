        "text": "Existentialist proposes a philosophical theory, known as existentialism, which developed as a reaction against both naturalism and idealism. It is treated as the latest movement of European thought and this philosophy is the newest to appear upon the intellectual scene.\n\nThe important existentialist thinkers repudiate the very label, which classifies them as belonging to this or any other group of philosophers. Obviously, it is a philosophy of extreme individuality. There are some very important areas of common agreement among all the existential thinkers.\n\nThe philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre (I905), Kierkegard (1813-55), Martin Heidegger, and Karl Jaspers have contributed towards the development of existentialism. Kierkegard is called the father of existentialism.\n\nFor Sartre, any man is potentially always in conflict v/ith his neighbor, and all social relationships - whether with family, one's friends, one's lover, or the state itself are doomed to frustration.\n\nAccording to existentialist thinker (Jean-Paul Sartre), the aims of education include:\n\nThe aim of education is humanitarian, which means inner development of man, development of real consciousness, or real self. Thus, to impart knowledge of self-existence is the fundamental aim of education.\n\nExistentialists emphasize the education of the whole man i.e. development of all aspects of his inner-self, his feelings, emotions, thinking, etc. realizing ultimately what he is, what is his purpose of life, and what he has to become.\n\nEducation must create an opportunity for free, ethical choices. Since an existentialist's choice-making is personal and subjective i.e. are emotional, aesthetic, and poetic, education must provide open learning environments for their self-expression.\n\nHence, Jean-Paul Sartre is related to the thesis that 'Man is potentially always in conflict with his neighbor and all social relationships are doomed to frustration'.\n\n-> The UGC NET City Intimation Link has been released for the exam scheduled from 21st to 23rd August 2024.\n\n-> The re-exam for UGC NET June 2024 will be conducted in CBT Mode from 21st August to 4th September 2024.\n\n-> The UGC-NET exam takes place for more than 80 subjects, to determine the eligibility for 'Junior Research Fellowship’ and ‘Assistant Professor’ posts.\n\n-> The exam comprises two papers - Paper I and Paper II.
