Used independently or as a part of a larger storm water management system, Flo-Well units collect, retain and discharge stormwater on-site, offering a gravel free alternative to a traditional dry well.

The units are modular and can be connected in series or stacked to meet a variety of project needs.

The units are manufactured from 100% recycled materials.
