It uses gravity to encourage water flow into one or more pipes along the top portion of the dry well. The water is then discharged through smaller openings distributed over the larger surface including the sides and bottom. It helps incoming water (such as rain) dissipate into the ground and away from your home, where it can reach groundwater eventually.\n\nAdvantages of Installing a Dry Well\n\nThis type of drainage system works very well in home applications if you are having problems with water properly draining in your yard. This type of drywell is versatile because it can help water drain from multiple locations on your property. For instance, it can handle water from sump pumps that help to keep your basement dry, as well as excess rain from soaking rainstorms that come from your driveway, gutters, and roof runoff.\n\nHaving proper drainage installed on your property is crucial to maintaining your backyard’s overall condition. Too much water in the ground that isn’t directed to appropriate draining areas can cause minor or major flooding in your basement and soak the soil underneath your grass – leaving it waterlogged and soft.\n\nThis type of drainage system is also beneficial because of its affordability. It does not require significant disturbance or construction in the ground around it and it works for a variety of applications as mentioned above. It is a practical, long-term solution for managing water buildup and runoff so your yard and permanent structures remain dry.\n\nHow does a dry well help irrigation?\n\nDry wells help with irrigation because it encourages excess water to soak back into the ground. It aids areas of your yard in drying out after excess rainfall which is especially helpful for residents of particularly wet areas of the country. Properly channeled irrigation allows tree roots and plants to have access to necessary water without being completely waterlogged.\n\nThe oxygen contained within the dry well is also beneficial to its operation because it helps to keep the drainage pit dry, so the soil that’s around it remains healthier as well. The oxygen assists with evaporating excess water from areas in and around the pit.\n\nOur expert landscapers can answer all your questions and help you decide if a dry well is the right long-term solution for your needs. Whether or not it will work depends on the size and scope of the project, and we can help evaluate this with you."
