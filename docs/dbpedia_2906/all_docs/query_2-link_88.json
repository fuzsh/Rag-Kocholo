        "text": "Product Details: NDS Flo-Well Kit\n\nThe NDS Flo-Well is a manufactured dry well that is an easy-to-install and sustainable solution for stormwater runoff. Used independently or as part of a larger stormwater management system, Flo-Well units collect, retain, and discharge stormwater on-site, offering a gravel-free alternative to a traditional dry well. Units are modular and can be connected in series or stacked to meet a variety of project needs and accommodate higher volumes of water. Each Flo-Well unit holds approximately 50 gallons of stormwater, 50% more than a traditional peastone dry-well. The NDS Flo Well is easy to install and does not require heavy equipment. It is environmentally friendly, made from 100% recycled materials, and filters stormwater naturally through the subsurface, reducing pollutants and helping replenish groundwater tables by discharging stormwater on site.\n\nQuick Look\n\nIncludes (QTY 3) #FWSPS33 Side Panels and (QTY 1) #FWAS24C cover\n\nUV inhibitors\n\nHolds approximately 50 gallons of water per unit\n\nFits: NDS Parts #FWAS24 & FWAS24C\n\nGravel-free interior provides 250% greater water holding capacity than comparable gravel-filled dry wells\n\nThirty 1 in. knockout weep holes provide additional infiltration capacity, simply punch out with a firm tap using a hammer and wrap Flo-Well Dry Well with filter fabric wrap (sold separately) to prevent soil intrusion.\n\nUse a bottom panel (sold separately) to the Flo-Well Dry Well to prevent soil erosion or provide a base for a sump pump\n\nCan be installed individually; when using more than one, install additional Flo-Well Dry Wells side by side, 18 in. apart; units can also be stacked up to 4 high when able to dig deep without hitting bedrock.\n\nNDS Flo-Well Dry Well can be buried or stacked up to 8 ft. deep and supports pedestrian traffic including lawn tractors\n\nSpecial ribbed design adds structural strength for long-lasting durability; no need to pack gravel inside\n\nConnect to 4 in.
