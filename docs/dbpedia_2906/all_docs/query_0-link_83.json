        "text": "Stormwater treatment BMPs are structural devices used to manage and treat runoff contaminated with pollutants. In some cases, these BMPs can also be used to divert runoff away from areas where pollutants may occur. These devices normally work by capturing runoff and allowing it to filter into the ground (infiltration), holding the runoff long enough for pollutants to settle out (detention/retention) or some combination of these two processes.\n\nWhen considering treatment BMPs, a good understanding of the site in terms of the drainage patterns and the rate, direction and volume of water coming from different areas is key to designing an effective system. In many cases, the services of a professional engineer may be required to provide this analysis. The information provided here is intended to help operators and owners evaluate and begin to screen alternatives for potential applicability at their sites. It should not be considered a design manual or a substitute for professional engineering guidance. See “For More Information” for a listing of more technical publications on this topic.\n\nIn general, marinas should try to reduce the total amount of runoff coming from the entire facility by using permeable material like gravel or shell whenever possible outside of maintenance areas. Permeable coverings slow runoff and allow water to filter into the ground rather than run directly into the basin. Redirecting slopes away from the shoreline can also help.\n\nIn many marinas, much of the runoff comes from offsite so it may not be practical to capture and treat all of the runoff. However, structural BMPs should be sized to collect and treat at least the first 0.5 to 1.0 inches of rainfall from impervious work areas. This is often called the “first-flush” because it usually contains most of the pollutants. To prevent premature failure, BMPs should also incorporate provisions for handling overflow from rainfalls greater than the design rainfall.\n\nThere are a large number of stormwater treatment BMPs, however, not all of them are applicable to marinas because of space, cost and site conditions. High groundwater tables, limited space, and aesthetic and safety concerns are just a few of the factors commonly found at existing marinas that may limit the type of BMPs that can be employed. The BMPs discussed here do not cover the full range of practices available, but they do represent those BMPs that are generally considered most suitable for conditions commonly encountered in marinas and for retrofitting existing boating facilities.\n\nVegetated Filter Strip\n\nInfiltration Trench\n\nDry Well\n\nVegetated Swale\n\nDeep Sump Catch Basin and Water Quality Inlet\n\nRetention/Infiltration Chamber\n\nFor More Information\n\nThe information presented here was derived from a large number of different sources.
