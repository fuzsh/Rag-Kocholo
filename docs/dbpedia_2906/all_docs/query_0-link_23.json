        "text": "Stormwater BMP Description Report As An Injection Well? Commercially Manufactured Stormwater Infiltration Devices Includes a variety of pre-cast or pre-built proprietary subsurface detention vaults, chambers, or other devices designed to capture and infiltrate stormwater runoff into the subsurface. Yes, since their designs often meet the injection well definition of subsurface fluid distribution system. Downspout Disconnection A practice where downspouts are directed to permeable surfaces where runoff can infiltrate. No Filter Strips and Vegetated Buffers Vegetated buffers are areas of natural or established vegetation maintained to protect the water quality of neighboring areas. Buffer zones slow stormwater runoff, provide an area where runoff can infiltrate the soil, contribute to groundwater recharge, and filter sediment. Slowing runoff also helps to prevent soil and stream bank erosion. No French Drains with Piping French drains with piping are a type of infiltration trench with piping. Refer to Infiltration Trenches and Basins with Piping or Open Bottom Arches for guidance. Yes French Drains without Piping French drains without piping are a type of infiltration trench without piping. Refer to Infiltration Trenches and Basins without Piping or Open Bottom Arches for guidance. No Infiltration Trenches and Basins with Pipingor Open Bottom Arches An infiltration trench is a rock-filled trench designed to receive and infiltrate stormwater runoff. An infiltration basin is an open basin designed to receive stormwater runoff and allow it to infiltrate into the subsurface. Runoff may pass through one or more pretreatment measures, such as a swale, prior to entering the trench or basin. The trench or basin is designed with an assemblage of perforated pipes, open bottom arches, drain tiles, or other similar mechanisms intended to distribute fluids into the subsurface. Yes Infiltration Trenches and Basins without Piping or Open Bottom Arches An infiltration trench is a rock-filled trench designed to receive and infiltrate stormwater runoff. An infiltration basin is a normally dry basin designed to receive stormwater runoff and allow it to infiltrate into the subsurface. Runoff may pass through one or more pretreatment measures, such as a swale, prior to entering the trench or basin. Pipes and other conveyances may be used to direct stormwater to the trench or basin, but there is not pipe or open bottom arches within the trench or basin itself. No Permeable Pavement Permeable pavement is a porous or pervious pavement surface, often built with an underlying stone reservoir that temporarily stores surface runoff before it infiltrates into the subsoil. Permeable pavement is an environmentally preferable alternative to traditional pavement that allows stormwater to infiltrate into the subsoil. There are various types of permeable surfaces, including permeable asphalt, permeable concrete and even grass or permeable pavers. No Rain Gardens & Bioretention Areas Rain gardens and bioretention areas are landscaping features adapted to provide on-site infiltration and treatment of stormwater runoff using soils and vegetation. They are commonly located within small pockets of residential land where surface runoff is directed into shallow, landscaped depressions; or in landscaped areas around buildings; or, in more urbanized settings, to parking lot islands and green street applications. No Reforestation Reforestation can be used throughout a community to reestablish forested cover on a cleared site, establish a forested buffer to filter pollutants and reduce flood hazards along stream corridors, provide shade and improve aesthetics in neighborhoods or parks, and improve the appearance and pedestrian comfort along roadsides and in parking lots. No Sand Filters A sand filter is a surface or subsurface device that percolates stormwater down through a sand media where pollutants are filtered out. Sand filter effluent is either infiltrated or discharged through an underdrain. No Tree Boxes & Planter Boxes Tree boxes and planter boxes are generally found in the right-of-ways alongside city streets. These areas provide permeable areas where stormwater can infiltrate. The sizes of these boxes can vary considerably. No Vegetated Landscaping Self-Explanatory. No Vegetated Swales Swales (e.g., grassed channels, dry swales, wet swales, or bioswales) are vegetated, open-channel management practices designed specifically to treat and attenuate stormwater runoff. As stormwater runoff flows along these channels, vegetation slows the water to allow sedimentation, filtering through a subsoil matrix, and/or infiltration into the underlying soils. No"
