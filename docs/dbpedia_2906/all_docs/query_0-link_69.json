        "text": "Stormwater is precipitation that falls on hard surfaces that do not allow water to infiltrate. Stormwater facilities function to collect this water to slow it down and allow it to drop out pollutants before collecting with other natural waters like ground water, streams, lakes, and bays. These facilities are the only “treatment” rainwater gets before entering other waterways, unlike sewer and drinking water.\n\nStormwater facilities come in many forms throughout urbanized areas. They are often owned and maintained by Homeowners associations (HOA) or private landowners but can be owned publicly as well. Reach out to your HOA, look in your property deed or reach out to a local agency to learn more about facilities in your neighborhood.\n\nStormwater Management Manual for Western Washington\n\nThese facilities can look like open spaces or ponds, but they are actually working landscapes. For safety reasons, some are delineated by fencing, however, some are not that obvious. Recognizing when an open space is a stormwater facility and not a dog park or playground, ensures proper function of the system. These facilities can include:\n\nSwales:\n\nBiofiltration Swale\n\nBioretention cells\n\nVegetated Filter Strips\n\nThese facilities operate below the surface, holding water to prevent overwhelming flows, catching sediment, and removing pollutants. These facilities are a junction for polluted runoff before it flows through pipes to natural waterways. These facilities typically present themselves as manhole covers and curb drains but they could also be below permeable cement in places like parking lots. Due to the confined spaces of these facilities, it is highly recommended to hire a contractor for maintenance. These facilities can include:\n\nCatch basin inlet/ manhole\n\nDrywell\n\nVaults\n\nRoutine maintenance is important to maintain your facility and avoiding expensive repairs. Private properties are responsible for maintaining their stormwater facilities.\n\nEvery facility should have a maintenance plan, someone in charge of managing that plan, and a record of all maintenance completed. Contact your local agency for regular inspections. Regular inspections and maintenance vary for different types of facilities. Maintenance plans should be based off all of the built features designated in the engineering plans.\n\nMost systems maintenance revolves around soil and sediments, weed control, and trash clogging systems. It is important to be aware of these in your system to ensure proper function.\n\nMaintenance for Swales\n\nRoutine trash and debris removal, especially during wet seasons\n\nMowing and weed management\n\nClear out sediment traps and/ or curb openings\n\nLook for standing water or bare spot that may indicate channel malfunction\n\nMaintenance for Ponds\n\nRoutine trash and debris removal, especially during wet seasons\n\nMowing, weed management and tree removal\n\nClear outlets and spillways of blockages and check for leaks\n\nRemove sediments as needed.\n\nMaintenance for Permeable Pavements\n\nRoutine sweeping and moss removal with a dry broom\n\nRefill aggregate between pavers as needed\n\nReplace broken sections\n\nLook for standing water\n\nMaintenance for Underground Facilities\n\nContractor recommended due to confined spaces and their safety hazards.\n\nLIST OF CONTRACTORS\n\nFacilities may require specific contractors due to name brand system and parts\n\nClear trash from inlets and outlets\n\nVacuum and jetting with proper disposal of material\n\nFilter maintenance and replacement"
