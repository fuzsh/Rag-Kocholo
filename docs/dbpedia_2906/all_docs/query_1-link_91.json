        "text": "Step 1: Capture The Rain\n\nBefore you can do anything with stormwater you have to catch it. Your house most likely already has ways to do this. Gutters and downspouts direct roof water. Surface drains collect water from driveways, patios, and landscapes. French drains collect surface and subsurface water.\n\nWhere does your water go from there? If you home is not new-ish and if you have not disconnected these from city stormwater lines then they are going to treatment plants and/or rivers.\n\nTo capture this water you have to interrupt the supply by disconnecting from the city's system. Portland wants you to do this! There is even an incentive program, which you can check out here.\n\nDisconnecting downspouts is pretty simple. You simply take your downspout out of the drain line near the ground and then direct the water elsewhere (more on that in a second).\n\nIf your surface or French drains connect to the sewer you are going to need to work a little harder. These connections are underground, and you may have no idea where they are. Contacting a landscaper or drainage specialist may be in order.\n\nAh, but what if you have surface water and soggy areas but no drains? Then you need to install them- and move to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Manage The Rain\n\nWe are now capturing much of the rain that hits your little piece of Portland (or Beaverton, Lake Oswego, whatever). Pat yourself on the back but don't pull a muscle because there is still work to do. Now it is time to do something with all that water.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to return it to the ground. Running lines from all your collection points to a dry well, or multiple dry wells, will allow the water to slowly percolate into the soil. This solution is elegant and pretty simple. It can be more complicated if you have really, really, bad clay. But for most of the Portland area that is not a big worry.\n\nDry wells may be the simplest solution, but there is more that you can do. You need a rain garden.\n\nTaking the water to a rain garden adds another layer of goodness to your endeavor. Now you are not simply getting water into the ground but also using plants to add another layer of filtering.\n\nDry wells can be part of the plan when you are building a rain garden, either to add water capacity below ground or to handle overflow if the rain garden gets full. With or without a dry well a rain garden is basically just a place where rainwater can be stored until it can soak into the ground.\n\nDone properly a rain garden is the ultimate landscape win-win situation. They are extremely practical and should be beautiful as well. Rocks can be used to create a feature that is not a mud pit and that looks good even when the weather is dry. Rain garden plants (see list in sidebar) can handle the bog/dry cycle and put the \"garden\" in rain garden.\n\nMany homeowners are taking space that was previously lawn and turning it into a rain garden. Now they use less water on the landscape, don't need to fertilize as often in addition to all the other benefits. I think you can see why rain gardens are a key component of my imaginary 'guilt free' gardens!\n\nHere at Ross NW Watergardens we try to design rain gardens that blend into the landscape, so no one even realizes what a workhorse they are! You can read more about designing rain gardens here. And this book will help you design your own beautiful rain garden.\n\nWhat if you don't have the space for a traditional rain garden? Consider a container stormwater garden, which requires a lot less space. This article from EMSWDC will show you exactly how to do it.\n\nStep 3: (optional) Use The Rain\n\nYep, you can take this even further if you want. Instead of simply returning the water in a respectful way you keep the water until you can use it to water your existing plants.\n\nRain catchment systems can be as simple as a rain barrel with a hose bib at the bottom. Larger scale systems exist that can hold thousands of gallons and then dispense them using a pump.\n\nRegardless of scale, the concept is very simple: store the rain water and then use it during our dry summers. Watering your vegetable garden in August with water that fell in February is pretty cool.\n\nNeed help designing and installing one of these systems? Leave a comment below and we can talk.\n\nMaintaining Your Rain Garden\n\nRain gardens are generally low maintenance, especially when they are installed properly. But a little care will keep them functioning properly and looking great. The basic of rain garden maintenance:\n\nKeep all drains, pipes, and overflows free of debris. It is a good idea to check these in December, after most trees have dropped their leaves to make sure the water can easily flow to the garden. A couple average sized maple leaves can block a drain and send that precious water into the street!\n\nRemove weeds, exotics, and invasives from the rain garden. One of the big problems with invasives (like horsetail) is the way they can clog small natural streams. Don't let your rain garden become a distribution point!\n\nPeriodically clear the area of fallen leaves, dead grass, and other debris. This will keep you and the neighborhood happy with the appearance of your rain garden."
