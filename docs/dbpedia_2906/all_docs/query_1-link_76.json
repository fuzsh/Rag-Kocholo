        "text": "Hello fellow Journalers, I could use some advise but first, here is some background...\n\nI contacted the local consulting firm that handles building permits for our Pennsylvania Township (Berks Caernarvon) and inquired what was necessary to obtain a permit for a pole barn. Drawings of building, truss details, site survey with impervious surface calculations and a sketch of where the building will be sited. My property is 1 acre located in an Ag Preservation zone. I had heard about others have a ton of hoops to jump thru, this seemed fairly painless.\n\nI compiled all requested information and submitted it on a Monday during my lunch hour. That Wednesday morning at 8am I received a call from the township saying they had my permit... Wow. Fast forward a few months and one building shell 99% completed I received a letter from the Consulting firm that issued the building permit which reads...\n\nThe Township Engineer noted that he has not received any information on how the storm water runoff will be collected and handled on the site. Please contact him at your earliest opportunity.\n\nBefore all the advise involving pitchforks, torches and City Hall...\n\nPart of my justification in building the pole barn was that it would provide the opportunity to collect rainwater. I was hoping to be able to build a system without asking for approval, (or having to do a secondary drainage system) but now it seems I will have to redirect...\n\nWith all the above being stated...\n\nWhat exactly is the township engineer looking to see?\n\nCare to share your storm water management plans for your buildings?\n\nKnow of any engineers who are reasonable and good to work with on developing cost conscious solution?\n\nI have a good bit of slope to deal with and the building is down near the bottom of my property. This could be.... interesting!\n\nPerhaps this may help with the description. The corner of my property is the utility pole you can see behind the building... I am 12' off my property line.\n\nThanks for your input in advance!\n\nChris\n\nTry this website: http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/subject/advcoun/stormwater/Manual_DraftJan05/Section09-jan-rev.pdf\n\n'Rational Method' is a good starting point for calculating runoff on areas under 20 acres, though for just 1 acre the margin of error of any method is going to be quite high depending on what coefficient you assign to your property- looks like grass/ farm field.\n\nFor calculating storage or 'capture volumes' other methods are used. Township engineer should be able to point you towards a method they are comfortable with.\n\nIf it were my barn I'd be wanting to direct water away from those concrete retaining walls of the barn- if space allows, a swale at least 10' from the building and directing runoff away from your 2 overhead doors would be a start. Always better to direct runoff over grade vs. into below grade piping that could clog later- simple solutions first. Along the property line you may not have enough room for a swale to keep runoff from half your roof eventually making its way on to the neighbors property, but keep that strip unpaved and you'll minimize it. Save and store the water on that side and there won't be much runoff.\n\nHere in Mahoning County, NE Ohio, I could mother a build permit without first having a \"Downspout Permit\". Yes....me too.....a \"Downspout Permit\"! The county wanted to know what I was going to do with all the rainwater coming off my roof. And I liven 5.37 acres which is mostly wooded. I said the same thing I have been doing with all the rain.....it goes on the ground! And the said, \"No\"....it had to go to a steam, a pond, a drainage ditch by the road.....none of these were available. OR I had to run my downspouts and collect it all in a dry well. As my wall are 13'-6\" I wasn't planing on gutters.....little hard to clean. The permit Dept. Said that II will have gutters and downspouts or NO Build Permit!\n\nAsk the Build Dept. What they want and go from there. They had drawings as to what they required. Good luck!\n\nThank you to all for your replies.\n\nI am extremely limited with space, tight on the property lines and have a pretty good slope to deal with. Natural above ground runoff management is likely not going work well. The telephone pole you can see behind the building is the lowest spot on the plot.\n\nThere isn't a tree on my property and mostly evergreens on the neighbors so I think we might not have too much trouble with plugging the drain pipes from leaves.\n\nWe need to do more grading on the driveway to be able to get my motorhome down into the shed. I tried backing it down there the other day and proceeded to stuff the hitch firmly into the ground. I was hoping to get all that worked out before we went much farther with the rainwater plans.\n\nNo rest for the wicked I suppose!\n\nChris\n\nThank you to all for your replies.\n\nI am extremely limited with space, tight on the property lines and have a pretty good slope to deal with. Natural above ground runoff management is likely not going work well. The telephone pole you can see behind the building is the lowest spot on the plot.\n\nAnd I'm betting this is the issue. They don't want water coming off of the roof and the hill you cut into running on your neighbors property. That appears to be farm land and the excess drainage you are creating could make you liable for his crop failure !\n\nYou had better be concerned with run off from that hill also ! You are going to need some serious drainage on that side and it had better be installed by someone who knows what they are doing !\n\nPerhaps a large underground tank (500 Gal?) with the overflow going to a dry well. The problem with dry wells is that they ALSO need an over flow ! (Mine just dumps into my back yard and make a LARGE puddle. Of course the whole yard is about 3-4\" lower than the surrounding neighbors.)\n\nSome designs are large fiberglass arches that are buried with several feet of stone underneath (stone floor of arch). The chamber volumes were sized by the civil engineer based on typical storm volumes. The gutter downspouts at grade have a relief port in the event the well and soil are saturated. Captured water perks back into the earth\n\nwe did a whole walmart parking lot like that, intalled the arches. dump rock on top of them, then asphalt. its amazing that they will hold up loaded vehicles\n\nWhere can I find out more about the arches you are describing?\n\nI would like to see what all is involved with siting the drywell in the driveway right in front of the garage doors... Obviously it would need to be capable of supporting what could be sizeable vehicle traffic (larger RV).\n\nPerhaps a picture or 2 would help provide more insight to the topography.\n\nMy property is the one with the red racecar trailer next to the house.\n\nChris\n\nGranted, I am a simple guy, but I am really having a hard time understanding this.\n\nTaking it to the extreme, wouldn't the end result be no rivers or lakes?\n\nWe live on 2.5 acres on the side of a hill in Edmond, OK, a suburb of OKC. It would not be possible to keep all the water here. Period. Not possible.\n\nWith their plan a large subdivision will dedicate an area to be a retention pond. The cost is split up among all the lots. But an individual buying a parcel from a farm would be responsible for the runoff from that property by itself. the engineering and build fees besides the lost use of a big piece of the property will make a one acre parcel almost useless. Most municipalities have limits to impervious cover, maybe 25% to 30% depending on the zoning. Do the calculations for a house, sidewalks and driveway, then add a garage, pool etc. When I called the county I was told they know it will make many lots unbuildable because of terrain. They actually said the townships can use this to control development.\n\nOP, you've got beautiful property and a view to kill for !!!\n\nWith this thread getting into multiple pages, it would help other GJ readers to know WHERE. Now would be a good time to Update GJ Profile with your Location.\n\nWide-open area like your property seems ridiculous to require those ghastly expensive water \"storage\" solutions. Since your climate has freezing temperatures, that makes any potential solution only that much more difficult.\n\nHow about a compromise, using a landscaping feature like a clump/row of trees (maybe river birch) on that downhill slope with \"dry rock river\" leading up to the landscaping feature?? This will still let you surface-direct the flow of water (ie prevent erosion) to a smaller version of dry well and water could percolate into ground naturally.\n\nForcing management of all water flows seems silly/overkill for your rural setting. The solution that OldWizard showed was featured in home improvement show I watched, but critical need for exhorbinant expense was because downhill from house was a protected wetland, right in middle of city setting, and fact that house was huge on a small city lot.\n\nI'd fight the bureaucracy for ghastly expensive \"solution\" that isn't really needed in your rural setting. Main risk is erosion of too much water flow in one confined area (thus my idea to spread out, and slow down water in a landscaping feature).

This was a big year for us, we undertook some sizeable projects and love it here even more now than we have for the last 20 years!\n\nGenerally speaking I am not a fan of my location showing up in every post I make. I did include it however in the 2nd sentence of this original post as it surely seems relative to this thread.\n\nI agree with your assessment of wide open spaces and this seeming silly. We sited the building within setbacks and had we been told this was a requirement before it was built, that might have given us more pause for consideration.\n\nUltimately I want to be a good neighbor and we will come up with a reasonable solution. I do appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts and ideas. Always good to know what kind of options are out there so we can formulate the most sensible outcome.\n\nChris\n\nYou may want to obtain a copy of your local zoning ordinances. They are available from your township for printing costs. If they are threatening to take your building permit you may want to check with a lawyer. Here, central Pa., if a permit is given even in error it can't be taken away. If this was a requirement they should have told you up front before you got the permit. It sounds like you want to do the right thing but I doubt if you budgeted for an engineering study.\n\nThey aren't threatening to pull the permit. The exterior of the building is completed with the exception of gutters/downspouts. (I have been holding off on posting pictures because I had hoped to put everything in a build thread. I know how impatient you guys are!)\n\nOur 1 acre plot is pretty constrained with septic system location, slope and those pesky property lines! Honestly, if they had told me it was a requirement up front, I don't know that I could have gotten approval to built this size shed in the location where it is... So now its time to get creative with how to handle the runoff and for them to be open minded to our proposed solutions.\n\nI did speak with the engineer today after he has been out to the site and got to see everything we are up against. He is ballparking roughly $1500 for his services to help design a system. I shot him over a link to Larry's Stormchamber system to see if something like that might be effective for us.\n\nBudgeted? What's that? I was planning a concrete floor, electrical, lighting, insulation and a couple other things. We will have to see how we can do more ourselves or skip some things that are easy to go back and upgrade later as our heard of benjamins repopulates.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!\n\nChris\n\nGranted, I am a simple guy, but I am really having a hard time understanding this.\n\nTaking it to the extreme, wouldn't the end result be no rivers or lakes?\n\nWe live on 2.5 acres on the side of a hill in Edmond, OK, a suburb of OKC. It would not be possible to keep all the water here. Period. Not possible.\n\nThere are several issues that are addressed with this type of regulation.\n\n1) The existing infrastructure was not designed or built for an increased water flow. It shows up in several ways. Downstream properties are flooded. Culverts etc are not sized for larger flows.\n\n2) most rural houses are on wells. The water is old water that has taken many many years to get down to the well level. If you quickly drain all the water off your property it does not have time to percolate into the soil. Water shortages migh show up 20-50 years from now for you or for your neighbor or the guy 3 miles away. Water migration patterns are not obvious.\n\nI did a subdivision 10 years ago. I was concerned with the water percolation issue and also maintaining the natural high water / natural appearance of the property.\n\nHistorically the district was covered with brush. Pretty well all the farmers and cleared and leveled for grain crops. The property we bought had been used for cattle in the winter and was 'untouched'.\n\nI walked the property many times to get a feel for the land. I then laid out the property lines ensuring that each property was self contained. It had it's own eco system and would not affect the others. I had no control over how the new owners would use the properties, but I tried as much as possible. If you look at a map, other subdivisions are laid out with nice straight lines and all the properties are rectangular. My property lines follow natural features.\n\nI was supposed to put in number of culverts legally. With my layout I only put in 1 instead of 5 because I was letting the water flow in it's natural patter onto the land instead of onto the ditches. The engineer reviewed my 'napkin' and gave me a two thumbs up.\n\nThere is a new subdivision up the road that is discharging nothing into the ditches.\n\nAt the nearest corner, it floods every time we get big runoff in the spring or from rainstorms. I was talking to an old county employee and he said in the old days it never flooded. He said it did now because of all the acreages dumping water into the ditches. Ditches were built for the benefit of the roads not as a drainage system for acreages.\n\nWith the climate change, I'd hold onto every drop of water for 50 years from now.\n\nI work in the drainage industry, in particular municipal drains.\n\nIn Ontario, under common law, a lower or downstream owner does not have to accept any water from an upstream or higher land. In fact, surface water does not have the legal right to flow downhill.\n\nThis is primarily for agricultural properties but applies to any land.\n\nWhat I would assume the County is asking you to do is explain what you are doing with the extra water that will be generated as a result of hard-surfacing an area.\n\nOne of the items you may want to consider in lieu of a dry well is a feature that is called a 'Low Impact Development'. Basically it will be an area that has been prepared to allow the water to purcolate back into the ground. You would simply direct the water to this area either through piping or swales and let this feature do its thing.\n\nUsually, these features are covered with some type of garden and can be an attractive area on your property and could be much cheaper than a dry well or other system.\n\nMinnesota is actually a leader in the design and implementation of these systems. You should look into this."
