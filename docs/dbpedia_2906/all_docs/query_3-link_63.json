The aim is to assist the community with defining its priority stormwater management objectives, in the context of physical, environmental, and socio-economic concerns, and to develop and implement strategies to address the same, as expeditiously and to the fullest extent possible, within the resources the community chooses to allocate to these efforts.",

        "text": "In March, 2003, the Town of Berthoud adopted a Stormwater Quality Management Plan in compliance with the Phase 2 requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulation. The goal of the Plan is to protect storm water quality by controlling and/or eliminating pollutant discharges into stormwater sewer systems.\n\nThe regulation requires Berthoud to administer a group of programs to assure water quality is maintained. It also requires any individual or entity, planning construction activities that involve disturbance of one acre or greater, to design and implement erosion control and water quality measures into such activities and obtain a stormwater permit from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE)."
