The Jackson County Stormwater Management Program is a division of Public Development.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of the program is to reduce water pollution caused by stormwater runoff. Stopping pollution at its source is the most effective way to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed by storm water runoff into our storm drains, and ultimately, our rivers and creeks."
