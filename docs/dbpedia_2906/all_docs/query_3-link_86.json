        "text": "Managing stormwater reduces the impact of flooding, ensures public safety, reduces damage to property and helps keep our rivers healthy.\n\nWhen rainfall and snowmelt runs off hard surfaces like roads, parking lots and buildings, stormwater reaches waterways faster, in greater volumes and with more pollution.\n\nAs our city has grown to over 1.3 million people on a land area of over 850 square kilometers, we are working to reduce the pollution entering our rivers from storms and runoff.\n\nStorm drains (or catch basins) are the main way stormwater gets into the underground pipe system.\n\nThere are about 60,000 storm drains in Calgary which drain water off sidewalks, streets and roads.\n\nThe metal grates that can be seen at the edge of the road are only a portion of the catch basin structure.\n\nUnder the sidewalk is a barrel that collects water. The barrel is attached to a pipe that allows the water to be whisked away, eventually into our rivers.\n\nThese pipes start out small and get larger the closer you are to the river. They direct stormwater to the river by the way of gravity.\n\nFor issues with your storm drain, visit Storm Drains in Calgary.\n\nA dry pond is dry over 98 per cent of the time and can have playing fields in it.\n\nDry ponds fill with water very quickly in heavy downpours and can take as long as 24 hours to drain once the rain stops. Dry ponds are connected to stormwater infrastructure.\n\nWet ponds and constructed stormwater wetlands capture and contain stormwater – for a while. Wet ponds slow down water long enough to settle out some of the sediments and pollutants, helping return cleaner water to our rivers and streams through the stormwater system.\n\nThey are a critical piece of infrastructure that also help protect downstream communities from flooding. There are over 350 wet ponds throughout the city.\n\nA wetland is an area of land that is saturated with water either permanently or seasonally. It contains plants and the water is quite shallow before a storm.\n\nNatural wetlands are not directly connected to Calgary’s stormwater system.\n\nConstructed stormwater wetlands are closely related to wet ponds but are more shallow and tend to have more vegetation cover.\n\nOutfalls are exit points by which storm water leaves the pipe system and enters our rivers or creeks. There are more than 800 outfalls located across Calgary.\n\nIn winter, ice can build up and force water from the rivers or creeks, and into the storm mains and surrounding communities. The outfall gates prevent this from happening. The gates are closed and monitored daily during winter months (November to April) because the ice pack on the rivers can change dramatically in a short period of time.\n\nIf the level of stormwater is significant, the gates are opened and the water is released. The gates are then immediately closed again. During summer months (May to October), the gates are fully open; however, they are monitored during this time and closed during high river flows to prevent water flowing back into the community."
