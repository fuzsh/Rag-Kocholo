        "text": "Drainage Plan Requirements\n\nThe requirements depend on your situation, generally falling into one of three categories:\n\nSingle-family residential development not governed by a pre-approved drainage plan: If you build in an area with no approved drainage plan (most of Clallam County).\n\nResidential development governed by a previously approved drainage plan: If you build in one of these areas you must conform to the approved drainage plan. The County maintains a list of areas subject to pre-approved drainage plans. Any deviations from the plan must be prepared by a licensed civil engineer.\n\nNon-residential developments, multi-family residential developments, or land divisions: These developments require a drainage plan prepared by a licensed civil engineer.\n\nAll drainage plans must be approved by the Road Department before a building permit will be issued.\n\nStormwater Management\n\nAs of January 1, 2022 Clallam County adopted with modifications the 2019 Storm Water Management Manual for Western Washington.\n\nProperty owners can reference the Clallam County Stormwater Management Code.\n\nView the Stormwater Management Checklist and Application (PDF)\n\nA site on your property must be available for the stormwater runoff which does not conflict with any septic drain field, structure foundations, or public wells.\n\nMost of the rest of the lot must remain with vegetative cover such as grass, field, forest, or landscaping, and must not be covered with asphalt, concrete, driveways, or other relatively impervious surfaces. If the amount of such impervious surfaces exceeds 10% of the lot area, the County may require a drainage evaluation to be submitted.\n\nYour soils must be sufficiently permeable. Soils which allow the use of either a conventional sewage disposal system or a pressurized sewage disposal system (due to excessively porous soils) are considered to be sufficiently permeable.\n\nThe above guidelines are intended to simplify the screening of drainage plans by the County and are not necessarily all-inclusive. The County reserves the option to require submittal of a drainage plan prepared by a licensed engineer for any development.\n\nInspection\n\nThe drainage system must be inspected by the Building Division prior to certifying the structure for occupancy. Do not backfill over any underground installation until it has been inspected. Drainage system inspections will be conducted only during regularly scheduled building inspections prior to the final inspection, and installation must be complete prior to the final inspection. The inspection requirements vary depending upon the type of system approved for your development. You can find out more about the inspection procedure when you obtain your permit."
