This rule replaces SDCI's Small Project Point of Discharge protocol and prohibits any new drainage discharges to the \"formerly combined\" public sanitary sewers and requires mainline extensions for certain projects in the combined sewer and ditch and culvert areas.\n\nForms and Documents\n\nSubmittal documents: If drainage review is required, some or all the following documents must be submitted with the building or grading permit application.\n\nSmall Demolition Construction Stormwater Control Soil Management Plan\n\nThis pre-approved plan may only be used for small demolition permits which disturb less than 5,000 square feet of land and that do not require Drainage Review or a Grading Permit. The plan must be submitted without edits. To create a site-specific plan or if you plan to disturb more than 5,000 square feet of land, use the Standard CSC and Soil Amendment Plan listed below.\n\nStandard Construction Stormwater Control and Soil Amendment (CSC/SOIL) Plan (PDF) | CAD Version | CTB File\n\nRequired for all projects that require drainage review.\n\nStandard Drainage and Wastewater Control (DWC) Plan PDF) | CAD Version | CTB File\n\nRequired for all projects that require drainage review.\n\nSDCI Typical Drainage Details (PDF) | Extra DWC Detail Sheet Template (PDF) | CAD Version | CTB File\n\nSelect the applicable detail to put on the DWC Plan and, if needed, the extra DWC Detail Sheet.\n\nSDCI Standard Drainage Notes (PDF Version) | CAD Version\n\nAdd the applicable Standard Notes to the Drainage Plans if you're not using the Standard CSC/SOIL Plan and DWC Plan Templates\n\nOn-site Stormwater Management – List Approach Calculator\n\nRequired for all projects that require drainage review. Note: always start new projects with this link. Do not use a calculator that you have previously saved.\n\nPre-Sized Flow Control Calculator\n\nMay be used in lieu of continuous runoff modeling for projects that require Flow Control and have less than 10,000 square feet of hard surface.\n\nMemorandum of Drainage Control\n\nRequired for all projects that require drainage control facilities for On-site Stormwater Management, Flow Control, Water Quality, On-site Infiltration, or Dispersion.\n\nInfiltration Checklists: If your project requires On-site Stormwater Management (OSM), Flow Control, or Water Quality you must first investigate the feasibility of infiltration facilities (such as a dry well) to meet these standards. Submit the applicable infiltration checklist below with supporting documentation.\n\nSimple Infiltration Checklist\n\nPilot Infiltration Test (PIT) Checklist\n\nKing County Sewage Treatment Capacity Charge Forms: Submit the applicable form(s) below for projects that add or replace dwelling units or buildings or that convert buildings to a new use. See sewage treatment capacity charge - King County for more information on capacity charges. Note: these documents are required even if drainage review is not required.\n\nKing County Sewage Treatment Capacity Charge - Residential Sewer Use Certification\n\nKing County Sewage Treatment Capacity Charge - Non-Residential Sewer Use Certification\n\nKing County Sewage Treatment Capacity Charge - Alternative Housing Sewer Use Certification\n\nAdditional Forms: You may also be required to submit one or more of these forms.\n\nSide Sewer Easement Agreement\n\nSide Sewer Joint Use and Maintenance Agreement\n\nCertification / Attestation of Mailing Notification Form\n\nNote: If your project has 5,000 square feet, or greater, of new plus replaced hard surface area, your application must be prepared by a professional engineer. See the \"For Professional Engineers\" section below.\n\nDo I Need Drainage Review?\n\nYou need to get a drainage review for your SDCI construction or grading permit if one or more of the following apply:\n\nYou are disturbing more than 5,000 square feet of land\n\nYou are adding or replacing more than 750 square feet of hard surface, such as pavement\n\nYou are adding or replacing more than 750 square feet of a building (as measured by the roof outline)\n\nA grading permit is required for your project\n\nYou are applying for a subdivision, short plat, unit lot subdivision, or lot boundary adjustment\n\nYou are applying for a master use permit (MUP) for development on a property that has non-disturbance areas associated with environmentally critical areas (ECA) such as steep slopes, landslide prone areas, riparian corridors, wetlands buffers, etc.\n\nYour project is within a category I peat settlement-prone area per SMC 25.09.020\n\nOther less common criteria as described in SMC 22.807.020.A / Stormwater Manual Volume 1, Chapter 8\n\nWe use the Drainage Review Checklist as an aid when reviewing permit applications. While it is not comprehensive and does not include all requirements, applicants can use it as a reference to ensure that their drainage plans address the most common requirements to expedite our review.\n\nTraining\n\nWe have several opportunities for you to learn about the 2021 Stormwater Code.\n\nRecorded Video Trainings\n\nDrainage Review 101 and 2021 Code Updates\n\nThis training covers when drainage review is required, what to submit, and what drainage control will be required. It also highlights many of the updates to the 2021 Stormwater Code/Manual.\n\nInfiltration Feasibility and Testing\n\n2021 Updates to Drainage BMP Requirements\n\nReference Materials\n\nManaging Stormwater on Your Site - Implementation Guide (this fact sheet describes why we require on-site stormwater management, answers some common questions, and provides recommendations for implementing on-site stormwater management into development projects)\n\nDirector's Rule: DWW-430.1, Identified Public Combined Sewer Basins Where Flow Control is Not Required (Note: if groundwater will be discharged or the immediate downstream drainage system is considered to be \"Capacity Constrained,\" Flow Control may still be required.)\n\nTip 531, Post Construction Soil Management\n\nApproved Street Tree List\n\nVegetated Roof\n\nSPU Allowable Permeable Pavement Wearing Course Materials\n\nDirector's Rule 4-2011/SPU 2011-004, Requirements for Design and Construction of Side Sewers (Drainage and Wastewater Discharges) (see this document for allowable materials and construction methods for drainage and detention pipes and structures)\n\nFor Professional Engineers\n\nImportant Updates to Stormwater Modeling Requirements for 2021 Stormwater Manual\n\nThe following are a few of the stormwater modeling requirements that have changed with the 2021 Seattle Stormwater Manual. This is not a comprehensive list, but highlights some of the more impactful changes.\n\nThe Peak Flow Control Standard has changed and will result in facilities that are larger. See Volume 1, Section 5.3.5. Note: the Pre-sized Flow Control Factors for projects with less than 10,000 square feet of hard surface did not increase significantly.\n\nThe Pervious Land Segment (PERLND) and Impervious Land Segment (IMPLND) Runoff Parameters are required to be adjusted based on the project site characteristics. See the HSPS Parameter Modification section in Appendix F, Section F-4 and Table F.11.\n\nIf using MGS Flood, Version 4.56 (or later) with the new “Ecology Bioretention” element must be used. See items numbers 3, 7, 8, and 14-16 in the Clarifications to the 2021 Stormwater Manual\n\nDrainage Reports\n\nA drainage report prepared by a licensed civil engineer is required for projects with 5,000 square feet or more of new plus replaced hard surface or 1 acre or more of land disturbing activity. See Volume 1, Chapter 8 for comprehensive drainage review submittal requirements and Appendix B of the Seattle Stormwater Manual for drainage report requirements.\n\nPre-Sized Versus Stormwater Modeling for Flow Control and Water Quality\n\nProjects less than 10,000 square feet of new and replaced hard surface may use the Pre-Sized Flow Control Calculator or the pre-sized equations in Volume 3 of the Stormwater Manual. The pre-sized equations are in the in the BMP Sizing section for most of the BMPs in Volume 3, Chapter 5.\n\nIf there is more than 10,000 square feet of new and replaced impervious surface, then continuous runoff modeling with an approved stormwater model using the Seattle 158-year Precip / Evap series is required."
