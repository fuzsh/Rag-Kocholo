        "text": "Stormwater is the rain and melting snow that falls on our rooftops, streets, and sidewalks. As stormwater flows, it sweeps up pollutants such as oils, chemicals, sediments, pathogens and trash. Rather than being absorbed naturally into the ground, much of New York Cityâ€™s stormwater eventually flows into storm drains or catch basins, and from there into the Sewer System.\n\nWe oversee a broad citywide effort to better manage stormwater to improve the health of our local waterways and prevent flooding. Learn more about our MS4, Green Infrastructure, Bluebelt, and Long Term Control Plan Programs, as well as what you can do to protect local waterways with the Safe Disposal of Harmful Products."
