On natural surfaces that water infiltrates—or soaks—into the ground; but on paved surfaces, it becomes surface runoff. Surface runoff either flows to the nearest pond or stream, or it flows into an inlet such as a storm drain. Any pollution on the ground is carried away by the runoff, and because stormwater runoff and the water flowing into storm drains is not treated, the pollution ends up in our local waterways. That polluted water affects the aquatic life and our ability to use the water for recreational and industrial purposes.\n\nThe primary objective of the actions and programs carried out by the Stormwater Management Division are dictated by the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit issued by South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). The permit is a part of EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program designed to reduce the amount of non-point source pollution that negatively affects the health of surface water in our community. Our job is to prevent pollution and help keep stormwater clean. View the Stormwater Management Plan to learn more about how Richland County aims to fulfill its MS4 permit requirements and address surface water quality concerns.\n\nAnything other than stormwater that goes down a storm drain is considered an illicit discharge and should be reported by calling 803-929-6000!\n\nIt's Storm Drain Marking season and we’re looking for volunteers to mark storm drains!
