        "text": "CSUSMâ€™sStorm Water Management Plan aims to prevent or reduce the potential discharge of pollutants into CSUSM storm drains. Storm water is rainfall or any surface runoff that is discharged through storm drain. Before storm water is discharged through the storm drain, it may pick up debris, dirt, chemicals, or other pollutants as it flows through impervious streets, parking lots, facility yards, or building rooftops. Unlike regular sewer drain systems, any possible storm water contaminants discharged through the storm drain system are untreated and ultimately enters local waterways, such as rivers, lakes, and bays.\n\nThe SWMP is designed to identify potential sources of environmental pollutants that would significantly alter stormwater discharge, and to provide Best Management Practices (BMP) to reduce the discharge of pollutants into the storm drain system."
