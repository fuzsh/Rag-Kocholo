        "text": "The income from the charge can be spent on both capital projects and recurrent expenditure relating to new or additional stormwater management services to eligible land such as:\n\nplanning, construction and maintenance of drainage systems, including pipes, channels, retarding basins and waterways receiving urban stormwater;\n\nplanning, construction and maintenance of stormwater treatment measures, including gross pollutant traps and constructed wetlands;\n\nplanning, construction and maintenance of stormwater harvesting and reuse projects;\n\nplanning and undertaking of community and industry stormwater pollution education campaigns;\n\ninspection of commercial and industrial premises for stormwater pollution prevention;\n\ncleaning up of stormwater pollution incidents (charge can fund a proportion);\n\nwater quality and aquatic ecosystem health monitoring of waterways, to assess the effectiveness of stormwater pollution controls (charge can fund a proportion); and monitoring of flows in drains and creeks, to assess the effectiveness for flow management (flooding) controls (charge can fund a proportion); and\n\nnon-permanent staff specifically appointed to work on stormwater management project(s).\n\nAs a rule of thumb, approximately 10 – 15% of the costs associated with stormwater capital project works should be allocated for continued maintenance.\n\nFormal community consultation must occur through the inclusion of proposed stormwater management activities in a council’s draft management plan. There is no other requirement for community consultation. However the Office recommends that councils carry out additional consultation in the first year(s) of implementation of the stormwater management service charge to raise community awareness and assist determine priority stormwater management activities for implementation.\n\nAdditional consultation could take the form of highlighting the charge and related activities in the foreword to the management plan, producing media releases or advertising. Alternatively, it may involve community meetings.\n\nCouncils may charge no more than the actual cost of providing a stormwater management service to residential strata lots. As a stormwater management services charge relates to managing stormwater runoff from impervious surface areas, this is almost always substantially less for strata lots than the cost of providing the service to a standard residential property. It is therefore inappropriate to charge the same amount for a strata lot as for a standard residential property.\n\nIn calculating the cost of providing a service to a residential strata lot councils may charge up to 50% of the adopted charge as applied to standard residential properties. This effectively caps the stormwater management services charge to residential strata units at $12.50 per unit.\n\nFor example, if the cost of providing a stormwater management service to standard residential properties is calculated to be $20 per property, strata lots may be levied at up to $10 per strata lot.\n\nThe charge for business properties should be the lower cost of providing the additional stormwater management service, or $25 per 350m² (or part thereof). As a hypothetical example, a business property has a land area of 800m². If the cost of providing the extra stormwater management service to the property is estimated to be $95, but the cap for a land area of 800m² is 3 x $25 = $75, then the amount levied would be $75.00. The gap between the capped amount and the service amount must be funded from other income sources.\n\nThe charge for business strata lots should be the lower cost of providing the stormwater management service, or $25 per 350m² (or part thereof). The cost should then be divided on a pro-rata basis between the lots. As a hypothetical example, a property containing 10 business strata lots has a land area of 1,250m². If the cost of providing the stormwater management service to the building is estimated to be $120, but the cap for a land area of 1,250m² is 4 x $25 = $100, each of the 10 units may be levied an amount of $100 ÷ 10 = $10. Alternatively, the charge could be apportioned according to the area of each strata lot. The gap between the capped amount and the service amount must be funded from other income sources.\n\nThe charge may only be levied for additional stormwater management services provided to the parcel of land by the council. There may be individual instances where the council does not provide any service or provides a reduced level of service (eg. golf courses or coastal land discharging stormwater directly into the sea through a privately owned pipe).\n\nIn such cases a reduced charge or no charge may apply.\n\nThe offering of discounts or rebates to ratepayers of eligible land is at the discretion of each council. Discounts or rebates could be applied in circumstances where:\n\nresidents can demonstrate good stormwater management practice, eg. prior installation of rainwater tanks;\n\npensioners are liable for the charge; or\n\ncouncils wish to encourage business to adopt improved stormwater management practices.\n\nHowever, the mandatory concession that applies to ordinary rates, domestic waste, water and sewerage charges does not apply to the stormwater management charge.\n\nThe level of expenditure on stormwater management from a council’s general income should remain at or be greater than it was prior to introduction of the charge.\n\nIt is recommended that this be calculated by averaging the stormwater management expenditure by a council across an appropriate number of years (eg.3-5 years) to obtain a valid approximation of prior expenditure.\n\nCouncils will need to continue to use general income to provide stormwater management services to ineligible land, such as public land and for funding existing services to eligible land. Where the costs of a new stormwater management activity can be attributed to both eligible and ineligible land, councils can use their current stormwater expenditure to fund the proportion of the activity’s costs attributed to ineligible land.\n\nWhere a council has not received Ministerial approval to raise their general income limit to include income from a special rate or drainage charge, councils would need to discontinue the special rate (or drainage charge) before implementing the new stormwater management charge.\n\nThe council will still be required to allocate at least the same amount of funding from its general income that was allocated prior to the introduction of the charge. The discontinuance of the ‘special rate’ or ‘drainage charge’ is intended to minimise confusion with ratepayers, who may otherwise consider that they are being ‘double-charged’. The amount of general income that a council can raise is not affected by the discontinuance of an existing special rate or drainage charge.\n\nFor general information and policy advice councils should contact the Policy team at the Office of Local Government on 02 4428 4100.\n\nFor technical advice councils should contact the Office of Environment and Heritage on 02 9995 5000."
