        "text": "Flooding Types\n\nTo understand the impact of coastal flooding on stormwater management, you must be aware of the types of flooding that coastal communities experience. There are three primary causes: rainfall runoff, river flooding, and coastal flooding.\n\nRainfall Runoff occurs from a precipitation event, and a heavy event (defined by high rainfall rates) can overwhelm a stormwater management system, causing water to inundate roads and property.\n\nRiver flooding primarily results from an extended precipitation event that occurs at, or upstream from, the affected area. River flooding can also occur when traditional flood-control structures, such as levees and dikes, are overtopped. Significant river flooding events in many coastal areas are often the result of tropical cyclones, such as Hurricane Floyd (1999) or Hurricane Harvey (2017).\n\nCoastal flooding occurs in areas directly adjacent to coastal waters. There are several distinct causes:\n\nHigh-tide flooding occurs in low-lying coastal areas during extreme high tides (also known as perigean or king tides ). These tides occur a few times per year when the sun, moon, and earth align. By definition, a coastal storm is not necessary for high-tide flooding to occur. However, even relatively weak onshore winds can increase the level of flooding.\n\nStorm surge results from more severe storms such as tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) and nor’easters, as strong winds drive water onshore. For example, Hurricane Hugo (1989), Hurricane Katrina (2005), and the March 2018 nor’easter generated extensive storm surge. Communities do not have to be directly in or next to the path of a large storm to experience surge effects. Wave setup, an increase in water levels caused by breaking waves offshore (while the storm is approaching the coast), increases the height of storm surges.\n\nSeiches are a surge-related coastal flooding phenomenon experienced on large lakes, such as the Great Lakes. During a seiche, water pushed up against one coast from a storm surge event moves to the opposite end of the lake. This results in both abnormally high and low water levels on opposite sides of the lake in a short period of time.\n\nLocalized wave action can significantly increase the amount of storm-related flooding and associated damage. Many factors contribute to wave heights , including wind speed and direction, nearshore bathymetry, and land cover near the shoreline. Wave runup is a significant hazard along steeply sloping shorelines and bluffs. Wave overtopping is the flow of water over the crest of a coastal structure, such as a seawall or dike, due to wave action. In addition to the damage waves can inflict directly on buildings and infrastructure, wave action can erode the shoreline and adjacent uplands.\n\nTsunamis are large waves generated by an abrupt disturbance of the sea surface, such as from an earthquake or landslide. A tsunami caused by a local event arrives minutes after generation, while a tsunami caused by a distant event arrives hours later. The 2011 Tohoku tsunami along the Japanese coast is a recent example of the devastating effects of tsunamis.\n\nIn addition to episodic flooding events, coastal communities are experiencing long-term water level changes caused by global sea level rise, relative sea level rise, and the Great Lakes’ water level cycles.\n\nGlobal (or eustatic) sea level rise is caused by a change in the volume of the world’s oceans due to expansion as the oceans warm, as well as the melting of land-based ice (glaciers and ice sheets).\n\nRelative sea level rise is caused by a combination of global, regional, and local sea level increases caused by regional oceanographic patterns, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, hydrologic cycles (river flow), and local or regional vertical land motion (subsidence or uplift).\n\nLong-term Great Lakes water level cycles cause periods of higher and lower lake levels that correspond to longer-term temperature and precipitation trends. Record low levels, such as those seen in Lakes Michigan and Huron in 1964, can impact navigation. Higher water levels, like those that occurred in 2017 in Lake Ontario and are now occurring (as of 2018) on Lake Superior, can contribute to property damage from coastal storms.\n\nImpacts: Stormwater Infrastructure\n\nCoastal communities employ a variety of engineered systems to manage stormwater.\n\nRegardless of the system, the low-lying nature of many coastal areas presents unique stormwater management challenges that are exacerbated by coastal flooding.\n\nSmaller coastal communities often employ a simple system of surface conveyances, such as open ditches along roads and highways. Some larger communities have separate systems for stormwater and sewage. Older areas may have combined sewer systems that collect and treat both stormwater runoff and sewage, but many of these are being phased out because of water quality and overflow issues.\n\nRegardless of the system, the low-lying nature of many coastal areas presents unique stormwater management challenges that are exacerbated by coastal flooding.\n\nSome systems depend on gravity to help water move through the pipes. Flat topography can make this a difficult approach that is further compromised by flooding that causes outfalls to be partially or completely submerged. This combination can greatly prolong a flooding event.\n\nCoastal flooding at outfalls may drive backflow into the system, causing upland flooding through street drains and drainage ditches. The prolonged presence of saltwater can damage stormwater infrastructure.\n\nShoreline erosion may expose stormwater infrastructure to potential damage.\n\nFlooding may introduce debris that can clog storm drains, pipes, and outfalls.\n\nMore frequent, higher, and longer-lasting high water events may drive up already high groundwater levels in some coastal communities. This change may reduce the soil’s ability to absorb stormwater, thus increasing runoff.\n\nIdentifying thresholds beyond which the stability and performance of existing stormwater systems are adversely impacted is an important way to understand the current and future vulnerability to changing coastal total water levels. Understanding the necessary performance criteria for stormwater systems to handle current and future water levels should lead to determining critical thresholds for both the design and retrofitting of new and existing systems. Critical thresholds are where stormwater infrastructure, such as outfalls, becomes vulnerable. Duration of coastal flooding events is also an important factor. Longer duration events tend to impact infrastructure more negatively. Longer storm surge or high tides will impact stormwater pipes, drain inlets, and overland flow volume, therefore increasing the duration of the flood event.\n\nUsing the information generated from the Quick Flood Assessment Tool in the “Assess Flood Risks” section and the methods presented in the “Analyze Stormwater Systems” section, coastal communities can make informed decisions about the current and future capabilities of their stormwater management systems in the face of coastal flooding."
