        "text": "After the Storm: A Guide for Citizens (PDF)\n\nCreek Friendly Yard Care (PDF)\n\nDuring winter, there are still some things that can be done to your yard which will help reduce the need for pesticides next growing season.\n\nDon’t Top Off at the Pump! (PDF)\n\nDid you know that “topping off” gas tank after the nozzle clicks can cost money and cause pollution to our streams?\n\nFertilizer and You (PDF)\n\nYou fertilize the lawn. Then it rains. The rain washes the fertilizer along the curb, into the storm drain, and into the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers. This causes algae to grow, which uses up oxygen that fish need to survive. So if you fertilize, please follow directions and use sparingly.\n\nHow Does Your Garden Grow? (PDF)\n\nGardens can make a big difference. Here is a reference guide for rain gardens.\n\nHow Much Water Can a Tree Retain? (PDF)\n\nOne mature tree reduces Storm Water runoff by over 1,000 gallons per year.\n\nHow You Wash Your Car Matters (PDF)\n\nWhen you wash your car, all the soap, scum and oily grit runs along the curb and into storm drains and the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers. This causes pollution which is unhealthy for people and fish.\n\nLeaking Oil Hurts Too (PDF)\n\nLeaking oil goes from your car onto the street. Rain washes oil into storm drains and into the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers. Now, imagine the number of cars in our region and you can imagine the amount of oil that finds its way into our local waterways.\n\nPet Waste (PDF)\n\nWhen your pets leave those little surprises, rain washes all that pet waste and bacteria into our storm drains. This pollutes our waterways.\n\nPrincipals and Suggestions (PDF)\n\nRainfall happens and with it the inevitable runoff and resulting impacts. What we as a society do to address the influences we have on our environment will have far reaching implications on the health, safety and welfare of future generations as well as on us here and now.\n\nSeptic Systems Tips (PDF)\n\nOne source of bacterial pollution to our local creeks appears to be pollutants leaking from septic fields.\n\nTake the Stormwater Runoff Challenge! (PDF)\n\nUrban Facts (PDF)\n\nThe most recent National Water Quality Inventory reports that runoff from urbanized areas is the leading source of water quality impairments to surveyed estuaries and the third-largest source of impairments to surveyed lakes.\n\nWe All Live Downstream (PDF)\n\nIn natural areas, storm water is not a problem. Nature has managed storm water through the Hydrologic Cycle. Storm water has been recycled since the dawn of time. In developed areas, both urbanization and agriculture have altered the Hydrologic Cycle and the natural management of storm water People have tried to control storm water runoff, but in many cases have created greater problems, increasing flooding, erosion and pollution."
