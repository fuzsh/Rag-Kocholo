        "text": "There are many stormwater management ponds in the county which permanently retain water by design to improve the region’s water quality. Some of these ponds may have algae or other aquatic vegetation. This vegetation may result from excessive nutrients, but algae and vegetation are not harmful, they are evidence that the pond is functioning as intended.\n\nPlease see the Howard County Guideline for Common Aquatic Plants, which will help identify aquatic plants you may observe in your community pond or lake. If you are concerned about aesthetic issues related to vegetation, the guideline identifies possible plant control methods, and explains the role plants play in pond ecology and the maintenance of water quality.\n\n*Howard County does not treat publicly owned or maintained stormwater management ponds for algae and/or other aquatic vegetation.\n\nIf the stormwater management pond is privately owned and maintained, the owner may control the algae or aquatic vegetation with approved herbicides. Any application of herbicides or pesticides to any body of water must be in accord with State and local law. The contractor applying the herbicides must be licensed by The Maryland Department of Agriculture (410-841-5700), hold a Toxic Materials Permit from The Maryland Department of the Environment (410-537-3003), and comply with the provisions of MDE’s NPDES General Permit MDG87.\n\nImproper application of herbicides or pesticides to any body of water may potentially result in an illicit discharge. For further information or to report an illicit discharge, please contact the Howard County Stormwater Management Division, Cynthia Alden."
