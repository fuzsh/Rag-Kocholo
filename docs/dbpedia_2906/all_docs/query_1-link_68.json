        "text": "Not sure if this belongs under this topic as I don't know much about this. Why would someone have several large dry wells and grit chambers all over the lot of a luxury house? What do they do? Tried looking it up but something came up about a sewage plant. The house is near the ocean, but so is my house and I don't have those. Are these optional, or would there be something about the lot that makes these necessary? Thanks!\n\nThe large dry wells are recent and the city supplies water and sewage removal. It's a VERY affluent area. in view of that, why would someone put those in? I thought I read something about preventing flooding and absorbing overflow? Not sure what a grit chamber is for. Both seem very odd. Would anyone here know?\n\nI've known a few affluent homeowners that have opted out of connecting to public utilities to be off the grid; even if it's just sewer to avoid paying the taxes and fees in the long run it pencils out.\n\nWe have some drywells here. They are basically to provide some storm water detention on site where it is impractical or impossible to connect to an existing municipal storm system.\n\nGrit chambers cause water to slow down so that suspended fine particles (like sand or gravel) drop out of the water stream. Guessing that the grit chambers are upstream of the drywells so that any fine particles are removed before they can clog up the drywells. the Grit chambers are usually much easier to clean. The objective in most situations is that there is a net zero increase to water run off from a lot.\n\nSomeone had a civil engineer design their storm water management system.\n\nShore areas (like south shore of Long Island) use dry wells for storm water management. The sandy soils allow the storm water to collect in the dry wells to reduce surface runoff and the sandy sub-soils allow the collected water to filter into the ground below the top soil. In upstate areas the use of detention/retention ponds are more common due to denser (clay) soils.\n\nThe grit chambers are new to me, but as noted by mark h, tmurray seems to have it correct.\n\nVaries by jurisdiction. Impervious surface calculations are becoming the norm for residential projects. In an odd twist on a new hillside addition, I had to take the foundation drainage groundwater (perf. pipe) into a new sump pump up to the street stormwater drainage. Ironically, the stormwater (downspouts) were allowed to dissipate onsite."
