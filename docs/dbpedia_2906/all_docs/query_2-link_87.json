Dry wells and other drainage systems are valuable investments that help protect homes and businesses from seasonal or weather challenges. Proper water management guards against several issues that arise after heavy rainfall and when the snow melts each year.\n\nDry Tech Waterproofing Solutions is a leading drainage services contractor serving customers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey. Our team specializes in dry well installations and other systems for residential and commercial properties. A dry well provides an option that can help you successfully manage runoff and avoid the risks associated with excess water accumulation.\n\nWhat Is a Dry Well?\n\nA dry well is an engineered, underground reservoir used to collect and disperse water. This reservoir is supported by cementing and remains out of sight. This makes it ideal for property owners seeking discreet drainage solutions that won’t interfere with the aesthetic of their landscape. Benefits of a dry well include:\n\nEasier water management\n\nDecreased risk of flood-related issues\n\nIncreased property value\n\nHealthier outdoor conditions\n\nOur Dry Well Installation Process\n\nAt Dry Tech Waterproofing Solutions, our team begins each project with a simple percolation test or “perc test.” Used to measure the rate of water absorption, this soil evaluation is essential to a properly designed dry well. The faster the water drains into a hole in the soil within a given amount of time, the better the location is for a dry well. This test also lets the professional see what type of soil is present, helping them decide which drainage solution would best serve the customer. For instance, properties with heavy clay soils that are less permeable may require additional water management options.\n\nDuring a property evaluation, our technicians determine the precise location for dry well installation. This guarantees excess water will drain into it via gravitational flow. Additionally, our team takes extra care to expertly execute each project. This includes making sure the depth of the dry well doesn’t reach the water table and that the system is properly sized to suit areas at greater flood risk.\n\nAdditionally, Dry Tech Waterproofing Solutions performs dry well repair services for customers in need of maintenance. We also offer a lifetime warranty on all our drainage systems, so every customer can feel confident their investment will last.\n\nSigns Your Property May Need a Dry Well\n\nWater is integral for a healthy ecosystem – it cultivates healthy lawns, gardens, and wildlife. However, too much water can cause damage to the structures on the property and the landscape itself. Dry Tech Waterproofing Solutions specializes in several types of drainage systems and can help customers decide whether a dry well is the ideal choice. Areas where drainage may be ideal include the following:\n\nResidential Property\n\nPooling is a primary sign that a dry well may be needed. For instance, rainwater flows into the gutters and out of the downspouts on your home, making it common for excess water to accumulate where your downspouts empty. Also, yards may pool in other locations. Water may rise at the base of a hill or in areas at slightly lower elevations than the surrounding yards.\n\nCommercial Property\n\nOn commercial properties, similar areas may require a dry well. Also, new construction can affect water drainage. Rainwater may have permeated the soil effectively before your business was constructed, but newly paved parking lots, walking paths, and other concrete areas limit the spots where water can soak beneath the surface. These provide greater opportunities for pooling and other issues.\n\nMany of the customers at Dry Tech Waterproofing Solutions seek better water management as a means to less erosion and a lowered risk of foundation damage. However, a dry well can also yield other\n\nbenefits. It can help prevent basement flooding during heavy rainfall and the spring thaw – and the subsequent risk of property losses and mold growth. It also helps you cultivate a healthier outdoor area for your family or clientele.\n\nIf you suspect your property has had water drainage issues in the past, our team can let you know if flooding has negatively impacted your home and other structures. We’ll provide additional services to repair the damage and help prevent future incidents.\n\nSchedule a Free Estimate Today\n\nDry Tech Waterproofing Solutions is proud to be a partner for homeowners and business owners throughout the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Delaware tri-state region, and we have built a reputation for using the best technology and materials with all projects.

I called the company, 2 hours later their tech was there correcting the issue and I have not had ANY water there or where I typically do. I watched carefully this past storm and feel relieved to not have been down there trying to pump out water for hours. I highly recommend Dry Tech for your waterproofing needs.\n\nVery positive experience. Quote was very detailed and specific and Matt from...\n\nVery positive experience.

With one call, Steve and his colleagues were here in a very short period of time and went to work to replace the pump. Not only did they do that, they replaced a “leaning tower” of make-shift piping to the drain outside. Oh, and their price was less than what was quoted by another company for just the pump! I highly recommend them. We will be using them for other projects!\n\nVery positive experience. Quote was very detailed and specific and Matt from...\n\nVery positive experience.
