        "text": "Stormwater or stormwater runoff is precipitation, such as rainwater, that falls to the ground but is not absorbed into the natural landscape. When stormwater is absorbed into the soil, it is filtered and flows into local waterways. When it isn’t absorbed, it runs off surfaces including rooftops, driveways, lawns, parking lots, roads, etc. and moves through a system of stormwater pipes and ditches. In Cobb County, eventually, all stormwater ends up in Lake Allatoona and the Chattahoochee River.\n\nIn developed areas, impervious surfaces such as pavement and roofs prevent precipitation from naturally soaking into the ground. Instead, water runs rapidly into storm drains, sewer systems, and drainage ditches, which can cause:\n\nDownstream flooding\n\nStream bank erosion\n\nIncreased turbidity (muddiness created by stirred up sediment) from erosion\n\nHabitat destruction\n\nInfrastructure damage\n\nContaminated waterways\n\nApproximately 22% of Cobb County's surface area is impervious. It’s critical that our stormwater is managed to reduce flood risks, protect waterways from pollutants, and help our streams, the source of our drinking water supply, remain healthy."
