        "text": "Stormwater Drainage Well -- General Permit GUSW00001\n\nUse of General Permit GUSW00001 provides timely authorization for subsurface disposal of stormwater by injection to waters of the State pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 445A.465; this regulation prohibits injection of a fluid through a well without a permit.\n\nThe Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) suggests users read the fact sheet and the general permit linked below and related information to determine if your activity requires coverage under Permit GUSW00001.\n\nIf you are subject to GUSW00001 permitting requirements, please complete a Notice of Intent (NOI) to seek coverage under the General Permit GUSW00001 by completing the forms electronically (see link below.) After filling in the required information, you will need to print out the confirmation page, have an authorized person sign it, and mail it, along with the applicable fee and all other pertinent information, to NDEP at the address indicated below.\n\nGeneral Information —The Stormwater Drainage Well (SWDW) General Permit, GUSW00001, authorizes stormwater discharges to groundwater via a drainage well. The SWDW General Permit establishes Notice of Intent (NOI) requirements, water quality limitations, prohibitions and management for two (2) separate discharge categories. These two discharge categories are 1) Minimal Risk Stormwater Discharges and 2) Moderate Risk Stormwater Discharges, and are described below:\n\nDishcarge Category 1 — Minimal Risk Stormwater Discharges: This category is established to provide coverage for sites that discharge stormwater which when managed properly has minimal risk of degrading groundwaters of the State. The following conditions must be met for an applicant to receive coverage under this category:\n\nGroundwater depth is farther than 5 feet below bottom of stormwater drainage well\n\nSWDW is greater than 1000 feet from the closest public water system well; and\n\nThe discharge must be solely from stormwater runoff and must not come into contact with other wastes or discharges not associated with stormwater runoff.\n\nWater quality sampling is not required under Category 1 permitted discharges.\n\nDischarge Category 2 — Moderate Risk Stormwater Discharges: This category is established to provide coverage for sites where discharge has a moderate risk of degrading groundwaters of the State. Permitted activities covered under Category 2 include any of the following site conditions:\n\nGroundwater depth is less than 5 feet below bottom of stormwater drainage well\n\nSWDW is less than 1000 feet from the closest public water system well;\n\nThe discharge has the potential to come into contact with other wastes or discharges not associated with stormwater runoff; and/or\n\nAny eligible discharge which NDEP determines is a moderate risk to groundwater and shall include pretreatment and water quality sampling.\n\nWater quality sampling is required under Category 2 permitted discharges.\n\nQualifying discharges shall not begin to discharge until the Division has received and approved the original complete and signed Notice of Intent, application fee, and other information required in Section A of the permit. Existing dischargers who are covered under a current individual permit may continue to discharge until the valid permit expires. New discharge systems are required to submit a Notice of Intent and fee no later than 30 days prior to the start of construction of the stormwater drainage well. Discharge systems that have already been constructed and are currently discharging without a permit shall submit a Notice of Intent and application fee within 180 days following the effective date of this permit.\n\nNewly constructed discharge systems covered under Category 2 are required to have a pretreatment device installed prior to discharge. A facility is considered new if construction commenced after August 1, 2013.\n\nApplication Requirements: The following must be submitted to NDEP as an application package:\n\nA Notice of Intent confirmation page with original signature;\n\nApplication fee; and\n\nSite plans and scaled map showing disposal details and the path that the water flows to the point of discharge.\n\nDischarge Category 2 Requirements: Along with the application requirements listed above, Category 2 applicants must also submit the following:\n\nActivities other than direct stormwater discharge that occur onsite, including potential accidental spills and industrial/commercial processes;\n\nA map showing the location of all public water system wells within 1000 feet of the disposal device; and\n\nA short summary of the sampling procedures, including how and where the samples will be taken."
