I live downhill from my neighbor and I'm trying to solve a problem of two much water running into my side yard and causing yard flooding. \nThe good news is that the flooded area is small and clearly at the low spot of my side yard. I was thinking about building a dry well to drain the water.\n...",

        "text": "Here are some tips depending on the level of severity of the problem. Digging a dry well is a simple as you indicate. Its just alot of hard work and where will you put all of that excavated soil?\n\nAn option is to put in a small sump pump you can buy at Home Depot for less than $100. You just need a nearby electrical outlet to plug it into, or extend one to within the length of the cord.\n\nBuy an empty 5 gallon paint bucket and a sump pump small enough to fit inside of it. Dig a hole in the low point of the ponding area and place the bucket low enough so that it acts as a catch basin for the water. Use the bucket top as your \"grate\" by drilling a lot of 3/4\" holes in the top. Attach a pvc pipe to the outlet port of the pump and extend that pipe to where you want the water to be discharged. You could also use a garden hose. This pipe could be buried or not.\n\nWhen the bucket fills up to a point, the pump will kick on and pump the water through the pipe to a place that it can drain away without ponding - presumably in the front yard or elsewhere.\n\nI'm not a big fan of dry wells. Just think how much of the volume of that space is being displaced with all the rock in the backfill. How much air space or volume is left for water to fill in the voids? Plus, the soil must percolate sufficiently or its not worth the effort."
