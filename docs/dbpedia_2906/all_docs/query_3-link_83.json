        "text": "Stormwater Management and Pollution Control\n\nWhy Stormwater Management?\n\nStormwater management is the process of controlling the negative impacts to stormwater runoff resulting from land use changes, and most frequently those caused by land development. Also, human activities are largely responsible for the pollution found in our stormwater runoff. The EPA has cited urban stormwater as the largest contributor of pollutants to our waterways. Everything that we put on the ground or into the storm drain can end up in our streams and ponds including Grover’s Mill Pond, the Millstone River, Duck Pond Run, the D&R Canal and Lake Mercer. Some of it percolates down into our groundwater supplies. The D&R Canal is also a source of drinking water in our area. Each of us has a responsibility to make sure contaminants stay out of our waters. Be the solution to runoff pollution.\n\nThe State’s official definition of stormwater under the N.J.A.C. 7:14A rules is as follows:\n\n'Stormwater' means water resulting from precipitation (including rain and snow) that runs off the land's surface, is transmitted to the subsurface, or is captured by separate storm sewers or other sewage or drainage facilities, or conveyed by snow removal equipment.\n\nThe following are steps West Windsor Township has taken since the State of New Jersey adopted the Stormwater Management rules, N.J.A.C. 7:8:\n\nStormwater Documents:\n\nStormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SPPP) revised April 2021;\n\nMunicipal Stormwater Management Plan (MSWMP) adopted 2005;\n\nStormwater Outfall Map may be found on the Maps page\n\nStormwater Control Ordinance (SCO), Article XXI § 200-99 thru 200-109 Major developments are required to design their projects to address stormwater impacts due to the quantity of stormwater produced, the quality of the stormwater runoff and must provide for groundwater recharge equal to predevelopment recharge. Green Infrastructure Best Management Practices (“GI BMPs”) and nonstructural stormwater management strategies like low impact development (LID) shall be utilized to meet the goal of maintaining natural hydrology to reduce stormwater runoff volume, reduce erosion, encourage infiltration and groundwater recharge, as well as reduce pollution. GI BMPs and LID are to be developed based upon the physical site conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary on a project to achieve the established performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge. These requirements are reviewed by Township Land Use boards at the time of each development’s application to insure adequate stormwater management features are provided. These features can include bioretention basins, infiltration basins, dry wells, rain gardens, water quality swales, porous pavement (concrete or asphalt) and any other features which has been installed for stormwater management purposes.\n\nAfter a project’s approval and construction, these facilities must be maintained to prevent additional runoff and flooding of neighboring properties. Each project must identify a person who is responsible for maintenance of private stormwater management facilities. The person responsible for maintenance also has to evaluate how effective the maintenance plan is at least once per year, and adjust the plan, as needed. Records of routine maintenance activities and costs shall be kept to demonstrate compliance with the approved stormwater management facility maintenance plan, as per these local ordinances and also New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection regulations.\n\nCurrent Stormwater Ordinances - Chapter 150 Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan\n\nIllicit Connection, Article I § 150-1 thru 4 It is unlawful to connect any pipe or device to the municipal storm sewer system, or to spill or dump any material, other than Stormwater runoff or groundwater (via sump pumps) into the storm sewer system. The purpose of this Ordinance is to prevent pollution and contamination of waterways which receive discharge from our storm sewers. Discharge of sewage, wastewater, septic system or other waste discharge into the storm sewer system is prohibited. Roof drains and sump pumps discharging groundwater only are permitted.\n\nImproper Disposal of Waste, Article II § 150-5 thru 8 It is illegal to dispose of waste in any place not specifically designated for the purpose of solid waste storage or disposal. The purpose of this Ordinance is to prevent unsanitary conditions and groundwater pollution, and the discharge of pollutants into the storm sewer system and receiving waterways. The days of dumping any unwanted or used items, including old lumber, waste oil, paint cans or other materials are ancient history.\n\nLitter Control Article III § 150-9 thru 14 It is unlawful to throw, drop, discard or otherwise place litter of any nature upon public or private property, other than in a litter receptacle. This prevents the creation of unsightly and unsanitary conditions, and prevents litter from impacting waterways due to bacterial contamination, excess nutrients and chemical pollutants. Please dispose of all your litter, including cigarette butts, in the trash.\n\nPet Waste, Article IV § 150-15 thru 19 Pet owners are required to pick up and properly dispose of pet waste dropped on public or other private property. This prevents bacterial contamination and excess nutrients in pet waste from impacting local waterways. Please pick up after your pets and throw it in the trash.\n\nWildlife Feeding, Article V § 150-20 Feeding of wildlife on any public park, private deed restricted area (e.g., open space, greenbelt, conservation area), or on any other property owned or operated by the Township is prohibited. The purpose of this Ordinance is similar to the Pet Waste ordinance, because bacteria and excess nutrients in wildlife waste are harmful to humans and fish populations.\n\nYard Waste Collection Program, Article VI § 150-24 Yard Waste is regulated via Ordinances that establish the Township’s current zone collection system and the methods of collecting leaves, brush and other yard waste. This is to keep leaves and grass clippings out of the storm sewer system. This also helps to reduce flooding which can be caused by direct dumping of waste into waterways. For all things yard waste in West Windsor, please visit Yard Waste Collection or contact Public Works at 609-799-8370.\n\nRefuse Containers/Dumpsters, Article VII § 150-28 All dumpsters and other refuse containers that are outdoors or otherwise exposed to stormwater must be covered at all times. Also, the spilling, dumping, leaking, draining or other discharge of liquids, semi-liquids or solids from these containers into the storm sewer system is prohibited. Please keep your outdoor garbage cans and recycling bins covered. If you use a dumpster, please close the lid after each use.\n\nPrivate Storm Drain Inlet Retrofitting, Article VIII § 150-33 All privately owned storm drain inlets in areas of repaving, repair, reconstruction, re-grading, resurfacing or other alterations of facilities on private property must be retrofitted to current standards. This reduces the discharge of solids and floatables (such as plastic bottles, cans, food wrappers and other litter) into the storm sewer system and public waterways. The Township requires the use of eco-grates on all storm inlets. Please contact the Engineering Division should you require more information at 609-799-9396.\n\nPrivately-Owned De-Icing Material Storage, Article IX § 150-39 All privately owned permanent and temporary de-icing materials must be stored in a manner that prevents the materials from being exposed to stormwater. All materials must be kept completely covered in a pile that sheds water or must be stored indoors. This prevents dissolved pollutants from making their way into Township waterways and drinking water supplies. Temporary outdoor storage of loose materials is permitted between October 15th to April 15th while permanent structures can be used year-round. Any proposed temporary or permanent storage structure must have a Township Zoning Permit prior to construction, as well as a Construction Permit, if deemed necessary by the Township.\n\nStormwater Coordinator Contact\n\nFor more information and questions on the Township’s Stormwater Program please contact:\n\nFrancis Guzik, PE, CME\n\nDirector of Community Development and Township Engineer\n\nTownship of West Windsor\n\n271 Clarksville Road\n\nP.O.
