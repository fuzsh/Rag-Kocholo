        "text": "Stormwater Management is Our Shared Responsibility\n\nUM-Flint is fortunate to be located adjacent to the Flint River in Downtown Flint in the Flint River Watershed. The community is home to many that recognize the Flint River as one of the great assets of our community and are committed to protecting and improving this resource for all to enjoy. Historically, the post-industrial environmental conditions resulting from the extensive industrial activity over the last hundred years present an ongoing challenge to our community and overall watershed management. These historical industrial activities included lumber, carriage & auto manufacturing and repair, energy generation, and others. Although presented with challenges to the protection and improvement of water quality in our watershed, many committed and longstanding partnerships have developed and work in collaboration to revitalize, restore, and enhance our community’s recognized greatest natural resource, the Flint River.\n\nUM-Flint is one of many committed organizations in Flint and Genesee County working to protect the Flint River. The University’s implementation of the U-M Storm Water Management Program, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC), Contractor & Construction Safety requirements, and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) are programs that work toward protecting the Flint River.\n\nImproving the protection and management of stormwater helps ensure that surface water quality is improved and maintained. That means cleaner water for all of us and our children to fish, swim, kayak, canoe and generally enjoy. We all can work together toward this important vision and protect one of our communities’ greatest shared assets… the Flint River.\n\nWhat is a Watershed, and how does a Watershed Work?\n\nA watershed is the area of land where all of the water under it or drains off it goes into the same place. The City of Flint is part of the Flint River Watershed and any water that runs off from any portion of the University property or City eventually flows into the Flint River. University of Michigan-Flint is focused on protecting storm drains from all contaminants and preventing runoff of sediment and pollutants from entering navigable waters like the Flint River.\n\nLearn more about the FLINT RIVER WATERSHED and HOW IT WORKS by visiting the Flint River Watershed Coalition (FRWC).\n\nFacts About the Flint River and its watershed\n\n(from FRWC website)\n\nThe Native American name for the Flint River is Pewonigowink, meaning “River of Fire Stone”.\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\nWe want to acknowledge that the land that the University of Michigan – Flint campus is located is the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary homeland of many Indigenous nations, most recently the Anishinabek (including Potawatomi, Chippewa/Ojibwe, and Odawa) tribal nations.\n\nWe acknowledge the painful history of genocide, forced relocation, and removal of many from this territory, and we honor and respect the many Indigenous people, including those of the Three Fires Alliance, who are still connected to this land on which we gather.\n\nGet involved!\n\nThe Flint River Watershed Coalition (FRWC), Genesee County Parks and the C.S. Mott Foundation are leaders and partners in our community, providing vision, education, outreach and leadership in the area of stormwater management and river preservation/protection. Visit their website to learn more about the watershed you live in, the restoration activities planned in the area, and how to get involved in various volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy is stormwater management important?\n\nStormwater management is important to all communities, including Flint, because it focuses on controlling sources of runoff and preventing flooding by collecting stormwater and transporting it off-site while at the same time not causing adverse effects to our environment. By improving our collective efforts in stormwater management, we can prevent downstream flooding, stream bank erosion, increased turbidity, habitat destruction, changes in streamflow, sewer overflow, infrastructure damage, and contamination of aquifers, streams, rivers, and our Irreplaceable Great Lakes. Additionally, we can preserve our rivers and lakes for safe and enjoyable recreation.\n\nWhat is UM-Flint Doing to Improve Water Quality?\n\nThe State of Michigan issued the University of Michigan a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit authorizing stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) to waters of the State. The primary goal of this permit is to protect the waters of the State during construction, renovation, and maintenance projects on U-M properties. As part of the requirement for the permit, the U-M developed a Storm Water Management Program Plan (SWMPP) to reduce or prevent the discharge of pollutants in stormwater, including the University of Michigan – Flint. The SWMPP includes the following measures:\n\nPublic education and outreach program(s) on stormwater impacts\n\nPublic involvement and participation\n\nIllicit discharge elimination program for the campus\n\nPost-construction stormwater management program for new development and redevelopment projects\n\nConstruction stormwater runoff control\n\nPollution prevention and good housekeeping practices for U-M Operations\n\nTotal Maximum Daily Loads\n\nManaging the NPDES Permit and Storm Water Discharge Requirements\n\nUM-Ann Arbor Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) manages the NPDES permit and stormwater discharge requirements for the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Flint and Dearborn campuses. UM-AA EHS works closely with the UM-Flint EHS department on these permit-related issues as they apply to the Flint campus. For questions about the stormwater permit or additional information on procedures and practices to minimize the discharge of pollutants from campus construction efforts, contact UM-Flint EHS at 810-766-6763.\n\nCampus Community Storm Water Education\n\nEHS educates university staff, students, and the public on the importance of stormwater management and how it affects surface water quality and our vital ecosystems as part of our Stormwater Management Plan and in compliance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).\n\nStormwater Pollution Prevention Plan & Other Preventative Measures\n\nThe UM-Flint campus is covered under the UM-Ann Arbor’s NPDES Permit. As a condition of the coverage, UM-Ann Arbor’s Stormwater Management Program Plan (SWMPP) includes the regional campuses (Dearborn and Flint).\n\nThe goal of UM-Flint’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is to improve water quality by maximizing control of significant materials and reducing the discharge of such materials to stormwater from the Facilities and Operations (F&O) complex that might impact surface water quality standards.\n\nThe contents of UM-Flint’s SWPPP are outlined below:\n\nCampus Map\n\nList of all significant materials that could pollute stormwater\n\nAn evaluation and written description of the reasonable potential for the contribution of significant materials to run-off\n\nIdentification of the discharge point(s) through which material may be discharged if released\n\nA listing of all significant spills and significant leaks of significant polluting materials\n\nA summary of existing stormwater discharge sampling data.\n\nSWPPP Maintenance\n\nComprehensive Site Inspection (Quarterly)\n\nHousekeeping Procedures\n\nMaterial Handling Procedures and Storage Requirements\n\nSpill Prevention and Response\n\nErosion and Sediment Control\n\nEmployee Training – SWPPP PowerPoint\n\nSignificant Materials Expected to be in Stormwater Discharges\n\nStructural Controls for Prevention and Treatment\n\nSeveral University environmental programs administered through UM-Flint EHS provide guidelines when performing activities that may have the potential to impact stormwater, surface water, soil, or other environmental conditions. and resources. Some of these programs include the following:\n\nU-M Stormwater Management Program Plan (SWMPP)\n\nUM-Flint Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)\n\nSpill Prevention Control Countermeasure & Pollutant Incident Prevention Plan (SPCC & PIPP)\n\nSoil Erosion and Sedimentation Control (SESC) – U-M Procedure\n\nUM Contractor Safety Requirements\n\nStandard Operating Procedures, Guidelines and Other SW BMP Resources\n\nIllicit discharge elimination program for the campus\n\nSpill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan Fact Sheet\n\nSpill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan: Secondary Containment and Catchment Guidance\n\nPost-construction stormwater management program for new development and redevelopment projects\n\nDesign Deliverables\n\nStormwater Management – Post-Construction Requirements\n\nConstruction stormwater runoff control\n\nErosion Management\n\nSoil Erosion Control\n\nPollution prevention and good housekeeping practices for university operations\n\nConcrete Washout Water and Slurry\n\nDewatering Underground Vaults and Manholes\n\nDye Testing for Stormwater and Sanitary Systems\n\nExterior Cleaning and Powerwashing for Contractors\n\nReducing Pollution From Dumpsters\n\nWorking Near Stormwater Inlets\n\nStorm Water BMP Resources\n\nBMP Design, Pollutants Controlled Calculation Assistance, and Other Technical Manuals\n\nSoutheast Michigan Council of Governments\n\nThe International Stormwater BMP Database\n\nThe USEPA Menu of BMPs\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire Stormwater Center\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Stormwater Research Program\n\nStorm Water Annual and Mid-year Reports"
