        "text": "WARNING: You have chosen to translate this page using an automated translation system. This translation has not been reviewed by the City of Alexandria and may contain errors.\n\nThis page includes information on both structural and non-structural practices that are commonly recommended to mitigate drainage and erosion concerns. These practices can be used by any property owner and support the City’s Eco-City Clean Waterways initiatives. The practices on this list include structural stormwater best management practices (BMPs) approved for use in meeting stormwater regulations (per the Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse website), as well as smaller-scale homeowner versions of these practices and stormwater-friendly landscaping activities. Structural BMPs on this list are considered green infrastructure BMPs that strive to replicate the natural water cycle and manage stormwater onsite near its source to reduce impact on water quality, flooding, and stream bank erosion.\n\nChoosing a BMP for an Erosion or Drainage Problem\n\nThe \"Soak It Up! Stormwater Solutions for Homeowners\" webinar workshop hosted by the City and the Northern Virginia Regional Commission discusses the impacts of inadequate stormwater management, conventional solutions, and stormwater best management practice alternatives. The webinar describes what each BMP is; the function and application; and the benefits and limitations. The webinar is intended for homeowners who are considering implementing a BMP for an erosion or drainage problem rather than as a condition of development.\n\nPart I: Introduction (3 minutes)\n\nPart II: Conventional Solutions, Dry Well, Infiltration Trench, Swales (50 minutes)\n\nPart III: Conservation Landscaping, Rain Gardens, Permeable Pavers, Rain Barrels (50 minutes)\n\nVCAP FUNDING\n\nProperty owners are encouraged to install BMPs on their property to address erosion and drainage issues. The City partners with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District (NVSWCD) to administer the Virginia Conservation Assistance Program (VCAP) to provide technical assistance and grant funding – pending availability of funds – for applicable projects.\n\nThe VCAP Contractor List includes contractors who are familiar with stormwater BMPs and the Virginia Conservation Assistance Program, administered by the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District. Note that the City does not endorse any specific company. It is always recommended to ask contractors for a statement of their qualifications and follow up on their references, as well as getting at least three bids for any work to be done."
