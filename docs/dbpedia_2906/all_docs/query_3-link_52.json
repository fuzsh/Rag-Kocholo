        "text": "Storm water runoff is simply rain water or ice and snow melt that runs off the land into streams, rivers, and lakes. When storm water runs through polluted sites it picks up pollutants and transport them into water ways. As such, storm water runoff is regulated by the Clean Water Act. Storm water runoff can be managed through pollution prevention plans and management practices. The following are different areas of Storm water Management where more information is available.\n\nAttention: The SPCC plan is occasionally amended as materials that are required to have an SPCC are added or removed.
