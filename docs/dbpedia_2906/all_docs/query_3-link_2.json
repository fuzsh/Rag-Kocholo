        "text": "EPA works to reduce runoff and improve water quality by implementing stormwater management at its facilties. Stormwater is rainwater or melted snow that runs off streets, lawns and other sites. When stormwater is absorbed into soil, it is filtered and ultimately replenishes aquifers or flows into streams and rivers.\n\nIn developed areas, impervious surfaces such as pavement and roofs prevent precipitation from naturally soaking into the ground. Instead, water runs rapidly into storm drains, sewer systems and drainage ditches and can cause:\n\nDownstream flooding\n\nStream bank erosion\n\nIncreased turbidity (muddiness created by stirred up sediment) from erosion\n\nHabitat destruction\n\nCombined storm and sanitary sewer system overflows\n\nInfrastructure damage\n\nContaminated streams, rivers and coastal water\n\n“Green infrastructure” encompasses approaches and technologies to infiltrate, evapotranspire, capture and reuse stormwater to maintain or restore natural hydrologies.\n\nEPA manages stormwater at its facilities using internal and federal requirements. The Agency’s stormwater management strategies reduce runoff volumes and improve stormwater quality."
