        "text": "Stormwater is rain and snow melt that runs off rooftops, paved streets, highways, and parking lots. As it runs off, it picks up pollution like oil, fertilizers, pesticides, soil, trash, and animal manure. Most stormwater is not treated, even when it goes into a street drain. It flows downstream directly into streams, lakes, and marine waters.\n\nStormwater runoff is the leading threat to Washington's urban waters, streambeds, banks, and habitats.\n\nWhy does stormwater runoff matter?\n\nAs the population grows in Washington, urban development increases. This means more people, more developed land, and an increase in stormwater runoff and pollution to Washington's waters.\n\nUnmanaged stormwater runoff can:\n\nDamage salmon habitat.\n\nContribute to flooding and drought.\n\nContaminate swimming areas.\n\nPollute shellfish beds.\n\nContaminate the groundwater you drink.\n\nDegrade water quality.\n\nWhat are we doing about it?\n\nWe issue permits under federal and state laws to control surface and groundwater pollution from runoff. The most-populated cities and counties, as well as industrial sites, construction sites, and many businesses have stormwater permits.\n\nWe also:\n\nProvide guidance and technical assistance on how to comply with permit requirements.\n\nMonitor results to show how well we are doing.\n\nEnforce as a last resort when pollution limits in permits are not met. Penalty fines that we collect go to the stateâ€™s general fund or to dedicated pollution prevention accounts.\n\nProvide funding for stormwater improvement projects.\n\nWhat types of permits are there?\n\nThe federal Clean Water Act's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) has various permitting requirements based on different types of pollution discharges.\n\nBoth NPDES and State Waste Discharge stormwater general permits aim to control pollution discharges to water. For more information, see stormwater general permits.\n\nOur permits include:\n\nConstruction Permit\n\nIndustrial Permit\n\nMunicipal Permits\n\nPhase I\n\nPhase II: Western and Eastern Washington\n\nWSDOT municipal permit\n\nSand and Gravel Permit\n\nBoatyard Permit\n\nStormwater guidance & databases\n\nGo to our stormwater permittee guidance page to learn more about applying, changing, implementing, and complying with your stormwater permit.\n\nStormwater databases\n\nPermit and Reporting Information System (PARIS) contains stormwater compliance monitoring information.\n\nEnvironmental Information Management (EIM) contains stormwater characterization data.\n\nStormwater monitoring\n\nAre we successful at preventing or reducing pollution from stormwater runoff? Check out the Stormwater Action Monitoring (SAM) program and other results on the stormwater monitoring page."
