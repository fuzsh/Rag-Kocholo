It captures and channels water away from your home’s foundation, protecting your yard from flooding and soil erosion. Here’s a summary to get you started:\n\nOverview: A dry well typically consists of a perforated tank buried underground, filled with gravel or other aggregate material to facilitate water drainage.\n\nImportance: Proper drainage prevents water damage to your foundation and landscape, reduces erosion, and helps maintain the usability of outdoor spaces.\n\nBasics: To create a dry well, install PVC piping to redirect water from your downspouts or other sources to the dry well, where it will slowly infiltrate the ground.\n\nI’m Joe Gerrior, owner of Gerrior Masonry & Landscape Construction Corp. With over 34 years in the industry, my team and I have helped countless clients implement dry well drainage solutions to protect their homes and enhance their landscapes. Let’s dive into the essential guide for using dry wells effectively.\n\nWhat is a Dry Well?\n\nA dry well is an underground structure designed to manage and dispose of unwanted water, like surface runoff and stormwater. It helps prevent water damage to your property by allowing water to infiltrate the ground slowly.\n\nComponents of a Dry Well\n\nA dry well typically consists of:\n\nPVC piping: Redirects water from sources like downspouts.\n\nPerforated chamber: Made of plastic or concrete, with holes to allow water to seep out.\n\nGravel or stone: Surrounds the chamber to aid in water dispersion.\n\nLandscape fabric: Prevents soil and debris from clogging the system.\n\nTypes of Dry Wells\n\nDry wells come in various forms, each suited for different needs:\n\nSimple Gravel Pit: A basic pit filled with gravel, riprap, or rubble. It’s cost-effective but has limited storage capacity.\n\nAdvanced Chamber System: A larger interior storage volume defined by a perforated plastic or concrete chamber. This type is more efficient and durable.\n\nModular Units: These can be connected or stacked to meet specific project needs. Each unit can hold up to 50 gallons of water, making them highly versatile.\n\n“A dry well is a round concrete cylinder with stones in the bottom where drains lead into so water goes in and sheds out through the stones,” explains Eric McClure, a wikiHow staff writer.\n\nDry Well vs. French Drain\n\nWhile a dry well is a vertical system, a French drain is a horizontal trench filled with gravel or rock. Both are used to manage water, but they serve different purposes:\n\nDry Wells: Ideal for large volumes of water and can be hidden underground.\n\nFrench Drains: Better for redirecting surface and groundwater over a larger area.\n\nApplications\n\nDry wells are versatile and can be used in various settings:\n\nResidential: To manage roof runoff and prevent basement flooding.\n\nCommercial: For parking lots and large impervious surfaces.\n\nIndustrial: To handle stormwater in compliance with regulations.\n\nUnderstanding the components and types of dry wells can help you choose the right solution for your property. Next, we’ll explore how dry well drainage works to keep your landscape dry and safe.\n\nHow Dry Well Drainage Works\n\nDry well drainage is a smart way to manage excess water on your property. Let’s break down how this system works using three key processes: infiltration, percolation, and water dispersal.\n\nInfiltration\n\nInfiltration is the first step in the dry well drainage process. When it rains, water collects from surfaces like roofs, driveways, or patios. This water is then directed into the dry well, which is an underground structure designed to capture and store it temporarily.\n\nExample: Imagine a large paved parking lot. Before the parking lot was there, rain soaked into the soil. Now, water runs to the lowest area and pools. A dry well can capture this runoff and prevent erosion.\n\nPercolation\n\nOnce the water is inside the dry well, it begins to percolate. This means the water slowly seeps through the soil layers. The rate at which water percolates depends on the soil type. Sandy soils allow water to drain quickly, making them ideal for dry wells. On the other hand, clay soils drain slowly and might not be suitable without additional modifications.\n\nFact: To determine if your soil is suitable, you can perform a percolation test. Dig a hole, fill it with water, and measure how quickly the water drains. Detailed instructions are available from your local extension office.\n\nWater Dispersal\n\nThe final step is water dispersal. As water percolates through the soil, it eventually reaches more permeable layers. This helps disperse the water far from your home or other structures, reducing the risk of flooding and erosion.\n\nTip: Properly installed dry wells can hold up to 50 gallons of water per unit. Modular units can be connected or stacked to meet your specific needs.\n\nNext, we’ll discuss common problems you might encounter with dry well drainage and how to solve them.\n\nCommon Problems with Dry Well Drainage\n\nEven the best dry well systems can face issues. Here are some common problems and how to handle them.\n\nClogs\n\nClogs are one of the most frequent issues. Over time, dirt, debris, and organic matter can clog the dry well, reducing its effectiveness.\n\nExample: A homeowner in Woburn, MA, found their dry well filled with mud and stones after only a year of use. This caused water to pool instead of draining properly.\n\nSolution: Regular maintenance is key. Clean out the dry well periodically and use landscape fabric to filter out debris.\n\nOverwhelm\n\nDry wells can become overwhelmed during heavy rainfall. If the dry well’s capacity is exceeded, it can lead to flooding and erosion.\n\nFact: Each dry well tank can hold up to 50 gallons of water, but during a heavy storm, this might not be enough.\n\nSolution: Consider installing multiple dry wells or larger units. Modular systems can be connected to increase capacity.\n\nHigh Water Table\n\nA high water table can make it difficult for a dry well to function properly. If the groundwater is too close to the surface, the dry well may not drain effectively.\n\nStatistic: In areas with heavy clay soil, water drainage is slower, making dry wells less effective.\n\nSolution: Conduct a percolation test to determine soil suitability. If the water table is too high, alternative drainage solutions like French drains might be better.\n\nNext, let’s move on to installing a dry well for optimal drainage.\n\nInstalling a Dry Well for Optimal Drainage\n\nSite Selection\n\nChoosing the right location is crucial for effective dry well drainage. Here are the key factors to consider:\n\nLocation: Place your dry well at least 10 feet away from your home’s foundation and any public property. This helps prevent water damage and complies with legal guidelines. Use flags or spray paint to mark the location.\n\nSoil Type: Perform a percolation test to check if your soil can absorb water efficiently. Sandy or loamy soils are ideal. Avoid clay-heavy soils as they drain slower.\n\nProximity: Ensure the dry well is near the downspout with the most significant water pooling issue. This helps manage runoff effectively.\n\nExcavation and Preparation\n\nProper excavation and trenching are essential for a successful installation.\n\nDigging: Dig a hole about 4 feet deep and wide. The walls should be as vertical as possible, but a slight angle towards the center is acceptable.\n\nTrenching: Dig a trench from the downspout to the dry well, about 1 foot deep and 6 inches wide. Ensure it slopes toward the well to facilitate water flow.\n\nSafety: Always call DigSafe at 811 to locate buried utilities before you start digging. Wear safety gear like gloves and a dust mask, especially when handling PVC glue.\n\nInstallation Steps\n\nFollow these steps to install your dry well:\n\nPVC Pipe: Measure the distance from your downspout to the dry well. Cut the PVC pipe to length, adding extra for adjustments. Connect the pipes using PVC glue, ensuring a tight fit.\n\nLandscape Fabric: Line the hole with landscape fabric to prevent soil from clogging the stones. Leave enough fabric to cover the stones once the well is installed.\n\nStone Layering: Fill the bottom of the hole with a 6-inch layer of rounded stones. Place the dry well tank on top and fill around it with more stones until you reach the top edge. Cover the stones with the remaining landscape fabric.\n\nOverflow Emitter: Install an overflow emitter to manage excess water. Cut a hole in the dry well’s lid, attach the emitter, and trim the pipe to ground level.\n\nMaintenance Tips\n\nRegular maintenance ensures your dry well functions effectively for years.\n\nCleaning: Keep gutters and downspouts clean to prevent debris from clogging the dry well. Use leaf guards if necessary.\n\nInspections: Periodically check the dry well for signs of clogging or sediment buildup. If issues arise, you may need to re-excavate and repack the pit.\n\nPreventative Measures: Install filters on drain lines to catch lint and soap scum if using the dry well for gray water. Regularly clean these filters to maintain water flow.\n\nBy following these steps, you’ll ensure your dry well provides optimal drainage and protects your property from water damage.\n\nNext, we’ll answer some frequently asked questions about dry well drainage.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Dry Well Drainage\n\nWhat is the problem with dry well drainage?\n\nDry well drainage can face several challenges:\n\nClogs: Over time, debris like leaves, dirt, and sediment can clog the dry well, reducing its effectiveness. Regular maintenance can help prevent this.\n\nOverwhelm: In areas with heavy rainfall, a dry well might not be able to handle the large volume of water, leading to overflow. Ensuring proper sizing and additional drainage solutions can mitigate this issue.\n\nHigh Water Table: If the groundwater level is high, the dry well may not drain properly. This can cause water to back up, leading to surface flooding. A percolation test can help determine the suitability of a dry well for your property.\n\nHow does a dry well drain?\n\nA dry well works by infiltration and percolation. Here’s a simple breakdown:\n\nCollection: Water from your roof, driveway, or yard is directed into the dry well through pipes.\n\nInfiltration: The water enters the dry well, which is typically a large hole filled with gravel or a pre-cast concrete sleeve.\n\nPercolation: The water then seeps through the gravel and into the surrounding soil. The soil’s texture and composition play a critical role in how quickly water is absorbed.\n\nDispersal: Over time, the water disperses into the subsoil, away from your home and yard.\n\nIs a dry well better than a French drain?\n\nBoth dry wells and French drains have their advantages, and the best choice depends on your specific situation:\n\nDry Well:\n\n– Best for: Managing large volumes of water in a localized area.\n\n– Pros: Effective for deep water infiltration, easy to install in small spaces.\n\n– Cons: Can clog over time, less effective in areas with high clay content or high water tables.\n\nFrench Drain:\n\n– Best for: Redirecting surface water over a larger area.\n\n– Pros: Good for areas with poor surface drainage, can be extended over long distances.\n\n– Cons: Requires more space for installation, can be more expensive and labor-intensive.\n\nBy understanding the strengths and limitations of each system, you can make an informed decision about which drainage solution is best for your property.\n\nNext, let’s delve into the benefits and long-term care of dry wells.\n\nConclusion\n\nBenefits of Dry Wells\n\nDry wells offer several benefits that make them an excellent choice for effective drainage:\n\nEfficient Water Management: Dry wells quickly transfer excess surface water deeper into the subsoil, preventing pooling and flooding.\n\nCost-Effective: They are generally less expensive to install compared to extensive drainage systems.\n\nEnvironmentally Friendly: By allowing water to percolate back into the ground, dry wells help recharge groundwater supplies.\n\nLow Maintenance: With proper installation and occasional maintenance, dry wells can function efficiently for many years.\n\nLong-Term Care\n\nTo ensure your dry well continues to perform optimally, follow these simple maintenance tips:\n\nRegular Inspections: Check your dry well at least twice a year, especially after heavy rains. Look for signs of clogging or slow drainage.\n\nCleaning: Remove any debris or sediment that may have accumulated around the inlet. This helps maintain the efficiency of the system.\n\nPreventative Measures: Install a filter or screen over the inlet to prevent debris from entering the dry well. This can significantly reduce the need for cleaning.\n\nProfessional Help: If you notice persistent issues, it might be time to call in professionals. They can assess the problem and provide solutions to keep your dry well in top shape.\n\nWhy Choose Gerrior Masonry & Landscaping\n\nAt Gerrior Masonry & Landscaping, we specialize in providing comprehensive drainage solutions tailored to your property’s specific needs.
