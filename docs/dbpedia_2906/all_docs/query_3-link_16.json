        "text": "Stormwater ponds are designed to be catch basins for developed areas. Stormwater ponds collect rainwater (stormwater runoff) that runs over impermeable surfaces such as parking lots, roads, and buildings. In undeveloped areas rainwater can be absorbed into the soil, taken up by trees and plants or flow into rivers, streams or wetlands naturally. The daily activities of people cause pollutants to collect on impermeable surfaces and get washed into waterways during rain events. These pollutants include dirt, oil, fertilizers, yard waste and litter. Pollutants can be harmful to habitats and wildlife downstream if they are allowed into the ecosystem. With stormwater management ponds in place, rainwater can collect, sediment and pollutants can settle out before being released back into the watershed.\n\nStormwater management ponds are often located in common areas and attract wildlife. Due to the contaminants being collected by the stormwater management pond this can be potentially harmful to local wildlife if not properly managed. To keep the stormwater pond functioning properly, it may need to be periodically cleaned out to remove sediments that have accumulated over time. This can be an expensive and intensive process. Actions must be taken by community members to minimize contaminates entering the stormwater pond. We can all do our part to help keep our stormwater ponds healthy by being good environmental stewards in our community.\n\nSOLitude Lake Management is a nationwide environmental firm committed to providing sustainable solutions that improve water quality, enhance beauty, preserve natural resources and reduce our environmental footprint.
