In the case of restoration or retrofitting, deviation from these standards may be appropriate at the discretion of the approving agency.\n\nB.All applicable project proposals must include a stormwater management site plan for review by State and local government. The plan must address the minimum standards in §§ 8.6 through 8.17 of this Part.\n\nC.When a project’s stormwater management system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Part, its runoff impacts will be presumed to be in compliance with applicable state regulatory standards and requirements.\n\nD.Unless otherwise noted, all storm events referred to herein are 24 hours in duration and utilize US Natural Resources Conservation Service Type III precipitation distribution. Rainfall amounts for Rhode Island for various return frequencies are provided in § 8.6(E) of this Part and shall be used for design unless otherwise specified.\n\nE.Design Rainfall Amounts for Rhode Island: All Rhode Island County rainfall values were obtained from the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC) using regional rainfall data processed by NRCC from the period of record through December 2008.\n\nRI County\n\n24-hour (Type III) Rainfall Amount (inches)\n\n1-Year\n\n2-Year\n\n5-Year\n\n10-Year\n\n25-Year\n\n50-Year\n\n100-Year\n\nProvidence County\n\n2.7\n\n3.3\n\n4.1\n\n4.9\n\n6.1\n\n7.3\n\n8.7\n\nBristol County\n\n2.8\n\n3.3\n\n4.1\n\n4.9\n\n6.1\n\n7.3\n\n8.6\n\nNewport County\n\n2.8\n\n3.3\n\n4.1\n\n4.9\n\n6.1\n\n7.3\n\n8.6\n\nKent County\n\n2.7\n\n3.3\n\n4.1\n\n4.8\n\n6.2\n\n7.3\n\n8.7\n\nWashington County\n\n2.8\n\n3.3\n\n4.1\n\n4.9\n\n6.1\n\n7.2\n\n8.5\n\nF.If the standard or criterion is not used or achieved, a written technical justification that is acceptable to the approving agency must be provided.\n\nG.The design practices described in this Part shall be implemented by an individual with a demonstrated level of professional competence, such as a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Rhode Island.\n\n8.7Minimum Standard 1: Low Impact Development (LID) Site Planning and Design Strategies\n\nA.LID site planning and design strategies must be used to the maximum extent practicable in order to reduce the generation of the water runoff volume for both new and redevelopment projects.\n\nB.Applicants need to document that the full list of approved LID methods and/or procedures were explored at the site and need to supply a specific rationale in the event LID strategies are rejected as infeasible. The site planning process must be documented and include how the proposed project will meet the following measures and/or methods to:\n\n1.Protect as much undisturbed open space as possible to maintain pre-development hydrology and allow precipitation to naturally infiltrate into the ground;\n\n2.Maximize the protection of natural drainage areas, streams, surface waters, wetlands, and other regulated areas;\n\n3.Minimize land disturbance, including clearing and grading, and avoid areas susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;\n\n4.Minimize soil compaction and restore soils compacted as a result of construction activities or prior development;\n\n5.Provide low-maintenance, native vegetation that encourages retention and minimizes the use of lawns, fertilizers, and pesticides;\n\n6.Minimize impervious surfaces;\n\n7.Minimize the decrease in the \"time of concentration\" from pre-construction to post construction, where \"time of concentration\" means the time it takes for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point of the drainage area to the point of interest within a watershed;\n\n8.Infiltrate precipitation as close as possible to the point it reaches the ground using vegetated conveyance and treatment systems;\n\n9.Break up or disconnect the flow of runoff over impervious surfaces; and\n\n10.Provide source controls to prevent or minimize the use or exposure of pollutants into stormwater runoff at the site in order to prevent or minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater runoff.\n\n8.8Minimum Standard 2: Groundwater Recharge\n\nA.Stormwater must be recharged within the same subwatershed to maintain baseflow at pre-development recharge levels to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with the requirements described in §§ 8.8(D) through (H) of this Part. Applicants may be required to provide a water budget analysis for proposed groundwater dewatering. Recharge volume is determined as a function of annual pre-development recharge for site-specific soils or surficial materials, average annual rainfall volume, and amount of impervious cover on a site. Recharge must occur in a manner that protects groundwater quality.\n\nB.Stormwater runoff from a LUHPPL is not allowed to infiltrate into groundwater. The stormwater recharge requirement may be specifically waived if an applicant can demonstrate a physical limitation that would make implementation impracticable or where unusual geological or soil features may exist such as significant clay deposits or ledge, where recharge does not currently occur; fill soils; or areas of documented slope failure.\n\nC.Maintaining pre-development groundwater recharge conditions may also be used to reduce the volume requirements dictated by other sizing criteria (water quality, channel protection, and overbank flood control) and the overall size and cost of stormwater treatment practices .\n\nD.The recharge criterion (Rev) requires that the following volume of stormwater be recharged based on the amount of impervious area. The groundwater recharge requirement may be waived or reduced by applying the LID Stormwater Credit outlined in § 8.18 of this Part. Recharge requirements are based on hydrologic soil group (HSG) as follows:\n\nE.Recharge Factors Based on Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG)\n\nHSG\n\nRecharge Factor (F)\n\nA\n\n0.60\n\nB\n\n0.35\n\nC\n\n0.25\n\nD\n\n0.10\n\nF.The recharge volume is considered as part of the total water quality volume that must be provided at a site and must be achieved by disconnection of impervious areas (see § 8.18 of this Part), a structural practice that infiltrates stormwater into the underlying soils or substratum, or a combination of the two.\n\nG.Roof runoff may be infiltrated without pretreatment unless the roof is deemed to have a higher potential pollution load pursuant to § 8.14(C) of this Part. Recharged roof runoff can be subtracted from WQv but not from larger storm calculations, unless applicant verifies that the drywells are sized for the 100-year, 24-hour Type III storm event.\n\n8.9Minimum Standard 3: Water Quality\n\nA.Stormwater runoff must be treated before discharge. The amount that must be treated from each rainfall event is known as the required water quality volume (WQv). The required WQv is calculated as described in §§ 8.9(E) through (J) of this Part and excludes LID credits allowed under § 8.18 of this Part.\n\nB.The WQv must be treated by at least one of the structural BMPs listed in §§ 8.19 through 8.25 of this Part at each location where a discharge of stormwater will occur. Structural BMPs are generally required to achieve the following minimum average pollutant removal efficiencies: 85% removal of total suspended solids, 60% removal of pathogens, 30% removal of total phosphorus for discharges to freshwater systems, and 30% removal of total nitrogen for discharges to saltwater or tidal systems. Based upon results published in the scientific literature, the structural BMPs listed in §§ 8.19 through 8.25 of this Part will meet these standards when properly designed, constructed, and maintained. Pretreatment is required for water quality treatment practices where specified in §§ 8.19 through 8.25 of this Part.\n\nC.BMPs targeted to remove other pollutant(s) of concern and/or to achieve higher pollutant removal efficiencies may be required for impaired receiving waters, drinking water reservoirs, bathing beaches, shellfishing grounds, Outstanding National Resource Waters, Special Resource Protection Waters, tributaries thereto, and for those areas where watershed plans, including Special Area Management Plans or Total Maximum Daily Loads, have been completed. In some cases, the permitting agencies may require that an applicant prepare and submit a pollutant loading analysis developed in accordance with the provisions of §§ 8.36 through 8.38 of this Part.\n\nD. Applicants or other interested parties may petition DEM and CRMC to add one or more BMPs to the list of acceptable structural stormwater controls described in §§ 8.19 through 8.25 of this Part by submitting monitoring results and supporting information developed in accordance with the provisions of the Technology Assessment Protocol in §§ 8.39 and 8.40 of this Part.\n\nE.The required WQv, which results in the capture and treatment of the entire runoff volume for 90% of the average annual storm events, is equivalent to the runoff associated with the first 1.2 inches of rainfall over the impervious surface (i.e., 1 inch of runoff). The water quality volume requirement may be waived or reduced by applying the LID Stormwater Credit outlined in § 8.18 of this Part. The WQv is calculated using the following equation:\n\nWQv = (1”) (I) / 12\n\nWhere:\n\nWQv = water quality volume (in acre-feet)\n\nI = impervious area (acres)\n\nF.A minimum WQv value of 0.2 watershed inches (0.2 inches over the entire disturbed area) is required, which requires the calculation of the total site disturbance. This minimum treatment volume is necessary to fully treat the runoff from pervious surfaces on sites with low impervious cover, i.e., less than 20% of the disturbed area. However, this requirement does not imply that every pervious subarea of disturbance must be treated with a structural water quality BMP.\n\nG.For facility sizing criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation of development sites should be as follows:\n\n1.Impervious cover is measured from the site plan and includes all impermeable surfaces; and\n\n2.Off-site areas shall be assessed based on their “pre-development condition” for computing the water quality volume (i.e., treatment of only on-site areas is required). However, if an off-site area drains to a proposed BMP, flow from that area must be accounted for in the sizing of a specific practice.\n\nH.Acceptable water quality treatment BMPs are described in detail in §§ 8.19 through 8.25 of this Part. Other practices may be used to meet other criteria, such as recharge or flood control, but only the practices §§ 8.19 through 8.25 of this Part may be used to meet the water quality criterion. In addition, disconnection of impervious areas (see § 8.18 of this Part) may be used to meet some or all of the WQv, including the minimum WQv.\n\nI.Although most of the stormwater treatment practices in this Rule are sized based on WQv, flow diversion structures for off-line stormwater treatment practices must be designed to bypass flows greater than the WQf. The WQf shall be calculated using the WQv described above and a modified curve number (CN) for small storm events.\n\n1.The following equation shall be used to calculate a modified CN. This modified CN can then be used in a traditional TR-55 model, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, or spreadsheet in order to estimate peak discharges for small storm events. Using the water quality volume, a corresponding CN is computed utilizing the following equation:\n\n2.When using a hydraulic/hydrologic model for facility sizing and WQf determination, designers must use this adjusted CN for the drainage area to generate runoff equal to the WQv for the 1.2-inch precipitation event.\n\n3.Designers can also use a TR-55 model, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, spreadsheet to find the WQf. Using the computed CN from the equation above, the time of concentration (tc), and drainage area (A); the WQf for the water quality storm event can be computed with the following steps:\n\na.Read initial abstraction (Ia) from TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, Table 4.1 or calculate using Ia = 200/CN – 2\n\nb.Compute Ia/P (P = 1.2 inches)\n\nc.Approximate the unit peak discharge (qu) from TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, Exhibit 4-III using tc and Ia/P\n\nd.Compute the peak discharge (WQf) using the following equation:\n\n8.10Minimum Standard 4: Conveyance and Natural Channel Protection\n\nA.Open drainage and pipe conveyance systems must be designed to provide adequate passage for flows leading to, from, and through stormwater management facilities for at least the peak flow from the 10-year, 24-hour Type III design storm event. Protection for natural channels downstream must be supplied by providing 24-hour extended detention of the 1-year, 24-hour Type III design storm event runoff volume.\n\nB.The channel protection volume (CPv) is the 24-hour extended detention of the post-development runoff volume from the 1-year, 24-hour Type III design storm event. If a stormwater discharge is proposed within 200 feet of streams and any contiguous natural or vegetated wetlands in watersheds draining to cold-water fisheries, surface detention practices are prohibited (underground detention or infiltration practices will be required). Consult DEM’s Water Quality Regulations to determine if a project is in a watershed directly draining to a cold-water fishery. Discharges beyond 200 feet shall be designed to discharge up to the CPv through an underdrained gravel trench outlet.\n\nC.For facility sizing criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation of development sites are as follows:\n\n1.The models TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, or TR-20, incorporated above at § 8.4(B) of this Part, (or approved equivalent) shall be used for determining the CPv.\n\n2.The Rational Method may be used for sizing the conveyance system.\n\n3.Off-site areas draining to proposed facility shall be modeled as “present condition” for the 1-year storm event.\n\n4.The length of sheet flow used in time of concentration (tc) calculations is limited to no more than 100 feet for post-development conditions.\n\n5.The required minimum CPv shall be computed using either §§ 8.10(C)(5)(a) or (b) of this Part below:\n\na.A modified version of the TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, short-cut sizing approach.\n\n(1)This modification (Harrington, 1987. Design Procedures for Stormwater Management Extended Detention Structures. Maryland Department of Environment, Dundalk, MD) is for applications where the peak discharge is very small compared with the uncontrolled discharge. This often occurs in the 1-year, 24-hour Type III detention sizing. Using TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, the unit peak discharge (qu) can be determined based on the curve number and time of concentration. Knowing qu and T (extended detention time), qo/qI (peak outflow discharge/peak inflow discharge) can be estimated from Figure in § 8.10(C)(5)(a)((2)) of this Part. Figure in § 8.10(C)(5)(a)((3)) of this Part can also be used to estimate Vs/Vr. When qo/qI is <0.1 and off the graph, Vs/Vr can also be calculated using the following equation for Type II/III rainfall distributions:\n\n(2)Detention Time vs. Discharge Ratios. (Maryland Stormwater Design Manual. Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) 2000)\n\n(3)Approximate Detention Basin Routing For Rainfall Types I, IA, II, and III. (TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part)\n\nb.By calculating 65% of the direct runoff volume from the post-development 1-year, 24-hour Type III storm based on one of the approved models listed above, using the following equation:\n\n6.The CPv shall be released at roughly a uniform rate over a 24-hour duration. To determine the average release rate, use the following equation:\n\nD.The CPv criterion can be waived for sites that:\n\n1.Direct discharge to a large river (4th-order stream or larger), bodies of water > 50 acres in surface area, or tidal waters.\n\n2.Small facilities with impervious cover less than or equal to 1 acre.\n\n3.Projects when the post-development peak discharge from the facility without attenuation is less than 2 cubic feet per second for the 1-year, 24-hour Type III design storm event.\n\n8.11Minimum Standard 5: Overbank Flood Protection (Qp)\n\nA.Downstream overbank flood protection must be provided by attenuating the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development levels for the 10-year and 100-year, 24-hour Type III design storm events. In addition, designers must demonstrate that runoff from the site for storms up to the 100-year, 24-hour Type III design storm events actually reach proposed structural practices designed to meet this criterion.\n\nB.Peak flow attenuation is required for the 10-year and 100-year, 24-hour Type III design storm events.\n\nC.For facility sizing criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation of development sites are as follows:\n\n1.The models TR-55, incorporated above at § 8.4(A) of this Part, and TR-20, incorporated above at § 8.4(B) of this Part, (or approved equivalent) will be used for determining the required storage and outlet structures for attenuating the peak flows from the 10-year and 100-year, 24-hour Type III design storms.\n\n2.The standard for characterizing pre-development land use for on-site areas shall be woods, meadow, or rangeland. For agricultural land, use a CN representing rangeland.\n\n3.For purposes of computing runoff, all pervious lands prior to development shall be assumed to be in good condition regardless of conditions existing at the time of computation.\n\n4.If an off-site area drains to a facility, an applicant must also demonstrate safe passage of the 100-year event, based on actual conditions upstream.\n\n5.The length of sheet flow used in tc calculations is limited to no more than 150 feet for pre-development conditions and 100 feet for post-development conditions.\n\n6.An applicant must demonstrate that flows from the 100-year event will be safely conveyed to a practice designed to manage the 100-year event.\n\nD.The Overbank Flood Protection criterion can be waived for sites that:\n\n1.Direct discharge to a large river (4th-order stream or larger), bodies of water > 50.0 acres in surface area, or tidal waters.\n\n2.A downstream analysis indicates that peak discharge control would not be beneficial or would exacerbate peak flows in a downstream tributary of a particular site (i.e., through coincident peaks).\n\nE.A downstream analysis is required for projects meeting the project size and impervious cover characteristics in the table in § 8.11(E)(1) of this Part, or when deemed appropriate by the approving agency when existing conditions are already causing a problem, to determine whether peak flow impacts are fully attenuated by controlling the 10- and 100-year events. The criterion used for the limit of the downstream analysis is referred to as the “10% rule.” Under the 10% rule, a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is extended downstream to the point where the site represents 10% of the total drainage area.\n\n1.Table 3-5. Projects for Which a Downstream Analysis Is Required\n\n2.If flow rates and velocities (for Qp) with the proposed detention facility increase by less than 5% from the pre-developed condition, and no existing structures are impacted, then no additional analysis is necessary. If the flow rates and velocities increase by more than 5%, then the designer must redesign the detention structure, evaluate the effects of no detention structure, or propose corrective actions to the impacted downstream areas. Additional investigations may be required by the approving agency on a case-by-case basis depending on the magnitude of the project, the sensitivity of the receiving water resource, or other issues such as past drainage or flooding complaints.\n\n3.Stormwater designers must be able to demonstrate that runoff will not cause downstream flooding within the stream reach to the location of the 10% rule. The absence of on-site detention shall not be perceived to waive or eliminate groundwater recharge (Rev), water quality control (WQv), or stream channel protection requirements (CPv).\n\n4.A typical downstream analysis will require a hydrologic investigation of the disturbed area draining to a proposed detention facility and of the contributory watershed to the location of the 10% rule for the 10- and 100-year, 24-hour Type III storms. The approving agency may also request analysis of the 1-year, 24-hour Type III storm on a case-by-case basis. A hydraulic analysis of the stream channel below the facility to the location of the 10% rule will also be necessary. Depending on the magnitude of the impact and the specific conditions of the analysis, additional information and data may be necessary such as collecting field run topography, establishing building elevations and culvert sizes or investigating specific drainage concerns or complaints.\n\n8.12Minimum Standard 6: Redevelopment and Infill Projects\n\nA.Redevelopment does not apply to projects or portions of projects when the total existing impervious area disturbed is less than 10,000 square feet. However, specific regulatory programs may impose additional requirements. Any creation of new impervious area over portions of the site that are currently pervious is required to comply fully with the requirements of this Part. In no case on a redevelopment project shall the levels of stormwater treatment and recharge be less than the levels prior to initiation of the proposed project.\n\n1.The permitting authority may take into consideration prior projects or multi-phase projects in determining if the redevelopment threshold has been met.\n\n2.Building demolition is included as an activity defined as redevelopment, but building renovation is not.\n\n3.Removal of roadway materials down to the erodible soil surface is an activity defined as redevelopment, but simply resurfacing of a roadway surface is not.\n\n4.Pavement excavation and patching that is incidental to the primary project purpose, such as replacement of a collapsed storm drain, is not classified as redevelopment.\n\nB.Redevelopment Stormwater Requirements: In order to determine the stormwater requirements for redevelopment projects, the percentage of the site covered by existing impervious areas must be calculated.\n\n1.For sites with less than 40% existing impervious surface coverage, the stormwater management requirements for redevelopment will be the same as for new development. The applicant, however, can meet those requirements either on-site or at an approved off-site location within the same watershed provided the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that impervious area reduction, LID strategies, and/or structural BMPs have been implemented on-site to the maximum extent practicable. An approved off-site location must be identified, the specific management measures identified, and an implementation schedule developed in accordance with local review and with DEM/CRMC concurrence, as appropriate. The applicant must also demonstrate that there are no downstream drainage or flooding impacts as a result of not providing on-site management.\n\n2.For redevelopment sites with 40% or more existing impervious surface coverage, only Standards 2, 3, and 7-11 (§§ 8.8, 8.9 and 8.13 through 8.17 of this Part) must be addressed. However, the approving agency may require peak flow control on a case-by-case basis within a watershed with a history of flooding problems. Recharge and stormwater quality shall be managed for in accordance with one or more of the following techniques:\n\na.Reduce existing impervious area by at least 50% of the redevelopment area;\n\nb.Implement other LID techniques to the maximum extent practicable to provide recharge and water quality management for at least 50% of the redevelopment area;\n\nc.Use on-site structural BMPs to provide recharge and water quality management for at least 50% of redevelopment area;\n\nd.Any combination of impervious area reduction, other LID techniques, or on-site structural BMPs for at least 50% of redevelopment area; or\n\ne.If none of the above options are practical in terms of water quality management, alternatives may be proposed that would achieve an equivalent pollutant reduction by using a combination of other types of BMPs and strategies, including treating 100% of the redevelopment area by BMPs with a lesser pollutant removal efficiency than stipulated in § 8.9 of this Part (Standard 3: Water Quality).\n\n3.Off-site structural BMPs to provide recharge and water quality management for an area equal to or greater than 50% of redevelopment areas may be used to meet these requirements provided that the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that impervious area reduction, LID strategies, and/or on-site structural BMPs have been implemented to the maximum extent practicable. An approved off-site location must be identified, the specific management measures identified, and an implementation schedule developed in accordance with local review and with DEM/CRMC concurrence, as appropriate. The applicant must also demonstrate that there are no downstream drainage or flooding impacts as a result of not providing on-site management for large storm events.\n\nC.Infill Project Stormwater Management Requirements: For infill sites, the stormwater management requirements will be the same as for new development except that existing impervious area may be excluded from the stormwater management plan (unless subject to local approval or necessary for mitigation by regulation) and only Standards 2, 3, and 7-11 (§§ 8.8, 8.9 and 8.13 through 8.17 of this Part) need be applied. The applicant, however, can meet the recharge and water quality requirements either on-site or at an approved off-site location within the same watershed, provided the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that impervious area reduction, LID strategies, and/or structural BMPs have been implemented on-site to the maximum extent practicable. An approved off-site location must be identified, the specific management measures identified, and an implementation schedule developed in accordance with local review and with DEM/CRMC concurrence, as appropriate. The applicant must also demonstrate that there are no downstream drainage or flooding impacts as a result of not providing on-site management.\n\n8.13Minimum Standard 7: Pollution Prevention\n\nAll development sites require the use of source control and pollution prevention measures to minimize the impact that the land use may have on stormwater runoff quality. These measures shall be outlined in a stormwater pollution prevention plan.\n\n8.14Minimum Standard 8: Land Uses with Higher Potential Pollutant Loads\n\nA.Stormwater discharges from land uses with higher potential pollutant loads (LUHPPLs) require the use of specific source control and pollution prevention measures and the specific stormwater BMPs approved for such use. Allowable BMPs for LUHPPLs are included in the Table in § 8.14(D) of this Part. Many LUHPPLs require additional special permits such as a RIPDES Multi-Sector General Permit, and sector-specific required BMPs are included in Section VI of the Multi-Sector General Permit.\n\nB.Stormwater runoff from a LUHPPL shall not be recharged to groundwater, unless it has been adequately treated for the pollutant of concern as determined by the approving agency. The recharge prohibition at LUHPPLs applies only to stormwater discharges that come into contact with the area or activity on the site that may generate the higher potential pollutant load. In addition, infiltration practices should not be used where subsurface contamination is present from prior land use due to the increased threat of pollutant migration associated with increased hydraulic loading from infiltration systems, unless the contamination is removed and the site has been remediated, or if approved by DEM.\n\nC.The following land uses and activities are considered stormwater LUHPPLs:\n\n1.Areas within an industrial site (as defined in § 1.4(A)(111) of this Subchapter) that are the location of activities subject to the RIPDES Multi-Sector General Permit (except where a No Exposure Certification for Exclusion from RIPDES Stormwater Permitting has been executed);\n\n2.Auto fueling facilities;\n\n3.Exterior vehicle service, maintenance and equipment cleaning areas;\n\n4.Road salt storage and loading areas (if exposed to rainfall);\n\n5.Outdoor storage and loading/unloading of hazardous substances; and\n\n6.Disposal sites as defined in § 8.5 of this Part.\n\n8.15Minimum Standard 9: Illicit Discharges\n\nAll illicit discharges to stormwater management systems are prohibited, including discharges from OWTS, and sub-drains and French drains near OWTSs that do not meet the State’s Rules Establishing Minimum Standards Relating to Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems.\n\n8.16Minimum Standard 10: Construction Activity Soil Erosion, Runoff, Sedimentation, and Pollution Prevention Control Measure Requirements\n\nA.Soil Erosion and sedimentation control measures must be utilized during the construction phase as well as during any land disturbing activities.\n\nB. All soil erosion, runoff, sedimentation, and construction activity pollution prevention control measures must be designed and implemented in accordance with the SESC Plan requirements outlined in the Performance Criteria in § 8.16(D) of this Part. The Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook provides the recommended and primary means to achieve the performance criteria. The component of the Stormwater Management Plan that addresses this standard is referred to as a SESC Plan.\n\nC.For all land disturbance activities that require a permit from the RI DEM or the CRMC, a qualified SESC Plan preparer shall be a Rhode Island Registered Professional Engineer, a Certified Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control, a Certified Professional in Storm Water Quality, or a Rhode Island Registered Landscape Architect who certifies that the SESC Plan meets the Performance Criteria in § 8.16(D) of this Part. The Preparer shall have the speci?c credentials and experience needed to select the appropriate practices for the application. If the project involves signi?cant land grading or requires an engineered site design, then the SESC Plan must be prepared by a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of RI.\n\nD.SESC measures must be utilized during the construction phase as well as during any land disturbing activities. Owners and operators must design, install, and maintain effective soil erosion, runoff, and sediment controls. SESC plans must document how the proposed activities are consistent with the following Performance Criteria:\n\n1.Avoid and Protect Sensitive Areas and Natural Features: Areas of existing and remaining vegetation and areas that are to be protected during construction must be clearly marked on the plans. Throughout planning, design, and construction the Applicant must demonstrate that the activities are consistent with § 8.7 of this Part (Minimum Standard 1, Low Impact Development Site Planning and Design Strategies).\n\n2.Minimize Area of Disturbance:\n\na.Limits of Disturbance (LOD) shall be clearly marked on all SESC plans. The SESC Plan must identify how the Applicant has minimized the area of disturbance by locating sites in less sensitive areas in accordance with § 8.7 of this Part (Minimum Standard 1, Low Impact Development Site Planning and Design Strategies).\n\nb.Construction activity shall be phased to minimize the amount of area that is being actively disturbed. Activities disturbing greater than five acres must include phasing in combination with other controls.\n\nc.Adequate temporary controls must be installed on previous phases prior to initiating the land disturbance in subsequent phases until final site stabilization is achieved and post-construction control measures are brought on-line.\n\n3.Minimize the Disturbance of Steep Slopes: Construction activities should be avoided on steep slopes to the Maximum Extent Practicable to comply with § 8.7 of this Part.\n\n4.Preserve Topsoil: Site owners and operators must preserve existing topsoil on the construction site to the maximum extent feasible and as necessary to support healthy vegetation. If it is determined that preserving native topsoil is infeasible, the reasons why this was determined must be addressed in the SESC Plan.\n\n5.Stabilize Soils: Stabilization of disturbed areas must, at a minimum, be initiated immediately whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth disturbance activities have permanently ceased on any portion of the site, or temporarily ceased on any portion of the site and will not resume for a period exceeding 14 calendar days. Stabilization must be completed using vegetative stabilization measures or using alternative measures whenever vegetative measures are deemed impracticable or during periods of drought. All disturbed soils exposed prior to October 15th shall be seeded by that date. Any such areas which do not have adequate vegetative stabilization by November 15th must be stabilized through the use of non-vegetative erosion control measures. If work continues within any of these areas during the period from October 15th through April 15th, care must be taken to ensure that only the area required for that day’s work is exposed, and all erodible soil must be restabilized within 5 working days. In limited circumstances, stabilization may not be required if the intended function of a specific area of the site necessitates that it remain disturbed.\n\n6.Protect Storm Drain Inlets: If there is a stormwater discharge from the construction site to a storm drain inlet under the project’s control, the site owner and operator must install inlet protection measures that remove sediment from discharge prior to entry into the storm drain inlet. The operator must clean, or remove and replace, the protection measures as sediment accumulates, the filter becomes clogged, and/or performance is compromised. Accumulated sediment adjacent to the inlet protection measures must be removed by the end of the same work day in which it is found or by the end of the following work day if removal by the same work day is not feasible.\n\n7.Protect Storm Drain Outlets: Outfall protection must be used to prevent scour and erosion at discharge points through the protection of the soil surface, reduction of discharge velocity, and the promotion of infiltration.\n\n8.Establish Temporary Controls for the Protection of Post-Construction Stormwater Control Measures: Temporary measures shall be installed to protect permanent or long-term stormwater control and treatment measures as they are installed and throughout the construction phase of the project so that they will function properly when they are brought online. The plan shall identify areas where infiltration measures are proposed and provide measures to restrict construction activity to prevent compaction of the area. In cases where this is not possible to avoid the area the Plan must include methods to restore the infiltration capacity of the soils.\n\n9.Establish Sediment Barriers: Sediment control measures must be installed along the perimeter areas of the site that will receive stormwater from earth disturbing activities. The Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook provided the recommended and primary means to achieve this performance criteria.\n\n10.Divert or Manage Run-on from Up-gradient Areas: Structural control measures must be used to limit stormwater flow from coming onto the project area, and to divert and slow on-site stormwater flow from exposed soils to limit erosion, runoff, and the discharge of pollutants from the site.\n\n11.Properly Design Constructed Stormwater Conveyance Channels: Temporary conveyance practices must be sized to handle the peak flow from the 10-year, 24-hour Type III design storm. Temporary conveyance measures may be required to be sized to handle the peak flow from larger design storms as determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n12.Retain Sediment On-Site\n\na.The SESC Plan shall contain a combination of practices that control erosion, control run-off, and control sediment. The combination of practices must be designed to prevent discharges of sediment. All plans shall include inlet protection, construction entrances, and containment of stockpiled materials.\n\nb.For Disturbed Areas <1 Acre: Those areas with a common drainage location that serves an area with less than 1 acre disturbed at one time, a combination of phasing, stabilization and conveyances that provide run-off control will be sufficient.\n\nc.For Disturbed Areas 1 to 5 Acres: Those areas with a common drainage location that serves an area between 1 and 5 acres disturbed at one time, a temporary sediment trap must be provided where attainable and where the sediment trap is only intended to be used for a period of 6 months or less. For longer term projects with a common drainage location that serves between 1 and 5 acres disturbed at one time, a temporary sediment basin must be provided where attainable. Temporary sediment trapping practices must be sized to have a total storage volume capable of storing 1 inch of runoff from the contributing area or 134 cubic yards per acre of drainage area. A minimum of 50% of the total volume shall be storage below the outlet (wet storage). The Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook provides the recommended and primary means to achieve this performance criteria.\n\nd.For Disturbed Areas > 5 Acres: Those areas with a common drainage location that serves an area with greater than 5 acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin must be provided where attainable until final stabilization of the site is complete. The Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook provides the recommended and primary means to achieve this performance criteria. The volume of wet storage shall be at least twice the sediment storage volume and shall have a minimum depth of 2 feet. Sediment storage volume must accommodate a minimum of 1 year of predicted sediment load. See the sediment volume formula in the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook as the recommended and primary means to achieve this performance criteria. In addition to sediment storage volume and wet storage volume, the sediment basin shall provide adequate residence storage volume to provide a minimum 10 hours residence time for a 10 -year frequency, 24 hour duration, Type III distribution storm. To the maximum extent practicable, outlet structures must be utilized that withdraw water from the surface of temporary sedimentation basins, if required or specified by the designer, for the purpose of minimizing the discharge of pollutants. Exceptions may include periods of extended cold weather, where alternative outlets are required during frozen periods. If such a device is infeasible for portions of or the entire construction period justification must be made in the SESC Plan.\n\n13.Control Temporary Increases in Stormwater Velocity, Volume, and Peak Flows:\n\na.The Plan must identify all discharge points and propose a combination of practices to ensure control of both peak flow rates and total runoff volume to minimize flooding, channel erosion, and stream bank erosion in the immediate vicinity of discharge points. The plan must identify if discharge points from the site discharge directly to a surface water or to an off-site conveyance. The designer must ensure that the proposed combination of practices are adequate to protect the receiving waters and downstream conveyances from the excessive velocities that would cause scouring or channel erosion.\n\nb.In most cases, the combination of practices that control erosion, control run-off, and control sediment used to retain sediment on-site will be adequate to control temporary increases in volume and peak flows. However, the designer must evaluate if conditions warrant the use of additional retention/detention practices beyond those required to address § 8.16(D)(12) of this Part. The evaluation must include a description of site conditions and proposed on-site controls and conveyances for all discharge points. For those projects proposing a common drainage location that serves an area with greater than 5 acres disturbed at one time, the approving agency may require peak flow control on a case-by-case basis.\n\n14.Construction Activity Pollution Prevention Control Measures: The SESC Plan must describe the pollution prevention measures that will be implemented to control pollutants in stormwater. The owner and operator must design, install, implement, and maintain effective pollution prevention measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants. The Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook provides the recommended and primary means to achieve this performance criteria.\n\n15.Control Measure Installation, Inspections, Maintenance, and Corrective Actions:\n\na.The installation of temporary erosion, runoff, sediment, and pollution prevention control measures must be completed by the time each phase of earth-disturbance has begun.\n\nb.Construction sites must be inspected by or under the supervision of the owner and operator at least once every 7 calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event which generates at least 0.25 inches of rainfall per 24 hour period and/or after a significant amount of runoff.\n\nc.If an inspection reveals a problem, the operator must initiate work to fix the problem immediately after discovering the problem, and complete such work by the close of the next work day, if the problem does not require significant repair or replacement, or if the problem can be corrected through routine maintenance.\n\nd.When installation of a new control or a significant repair is needed, site owners and operators must ensure that the new or modified control measure is installed and made operational by no later than 7 calendar days from the time of discovery where feasible. If it is infeasible to complete the installation or repair within 7 calendar days, the reasons why it is infeasible must be documented in the SESC Plan along with the schedule for installing the stormwater control measure(s) and making it operational as soon as practicable after the 7-day timeframe.\n\ne.If corrective actions are required, the site owner and operator must ensure that all corrective actions are documented on the inspection report in which the problem was first discovered. Corrective actions shall be documented, signed, and dated by the site operator once all necessary repairs have been completed.\n\n8.17Minimum Standard 11: Stormwater Management System Operation and Maintenance\n\nA.The stormwater management system, including all structural stormwater controls and conveyances, must have an Operation and Maintenance Plan to ensure that it continues to function as designed. The Operation and Maintenance Plan shall identify measures for implementing maintenance activities in a manner that minimizes stormwater runoff impacts.\n\nB.The long-term Operation and Maintenance Plan shall at a minimum include:\n\n1.Stormwater management system(s) owners;\n\n2.The party or parties responsible for operation and maintenance, including how future property owners will be notified of the presence of the stormwater management system and the requirement for proper operation and maintenance;\n\n3.The routine and non-routine maintenance tasks for each BMP to be undertaken after construction is complete and a schedule for implementing those tasks;\n\n4.A plan that is drawn to scale and shows the location of all stormwater BMPs in each treatment train along with the discharge point;\n\n5.A description and delineation of public safety features;\n\n6.An estimated operation and maintenance budget; and\n\n7.Funding source for operation and maintenance activities and equipment.\n\n8.18LID Stormwater Credit: Rooftop, Roadway, Driveway or Parking Lot Runoff Directed to Qualifying Pervious Areas (QPAs)\n\nA.The LID Stormwater Credit using QPAs may be used to reduce the required Recharge Volume and Water Quality Volume, provided that any pervious surfaces used to treat and infiltrate stormwater runoff meet the requirements set forth herein. The application of the Credit does not relieve the design engineer or reviewer from meeting the remaining minimum standards described in §§ 8.6 through 8.17 of this Part or the standard of engineering practice associated with safe conveyance of stormwater runoff and good drainage design.\n\nB.Stormwater Credit shall not be applied:\n\n1.At sites where stormwater runoff is directed to non-permeable soils, such as bedrock and soils classified as Hydrologic Soil Group D;\n\n2.At sites with urban fill, soils classified as contaminated, and soils with a seasonal high groundwater elevation within 18 inches of the land surface.\n\nC.QPAs are natural or landscaped vegetated areas fully stabilized, with runoff characteristics at or lower than the US Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Numbers in the table below in § 8.18(D) of this Part. All QPAs must be shown on site plans, must have a minimum of 4 inches of topsoil or organic material, and must be located outside of regulated wetland areas and regulated buffer to a waterbody or wetland. In order for lawns to be considered as QPAs, they must consist of low-maintenance grasses adapted to the New England region.\n\nD.Maximum US Natural Resources Conservation Service Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) Runoff Curve Numbers for QPAs\n\nCover Type\n\nHSG A\n\nHSG B\n\nHSG C\n\nNatural: Woods Good Condition\n\n30\n\n55\n\n70\n\nNatural: Brush Good Condition\n\n30\n\n48\n\n65\n\nLandscaped: Good Condition (grass cover > 75% or equivalent herbaceous plants)\n\n39\n\n61\n\n74\n\nE.A LID Stormwater Credit is available when rooftop, roadway, driveway, or parking lot runoff is directed to a QPA where it can either infiltrate into the soil or flow over it with sufficient time and reduced velocity to allow for adequate filtering. QPAs are generally flat locations, where the discharge is directed via sheet flow and not as a point source discharge. The credit may be obtained by grading the site to induce sheet flow over specially designed, gently sloped vegetated areas that can treat and infiltrate the runoff. This credit is available for impervious cover associated with all land uses, except for runoff from that portion of a LUHPPL that may generate runoff with a higher potential pollutant load.\n\nF.If runoff from impervious areas is adequately directed to a QPA, the area can be deducted from total impervious area, therefore reducing the required Water Quality Volume and the size of the structural BMPs used to meet the removal requirement of § 8.9 of this Part (Standard 3). Redirected runoff can also be used to meet the recharge requirement as a non-structural practice.\n\nG.The LID Stormwater Credit is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n1.To prevent compaction of the soil in the QPA, construction vehicles must not be allowed to drive over the area. If it becomes compacted, the soil must be suitably amended, tilled, and re-vegetated once construction is complete to restore infiltration capacity.\n\n2.The QPA must be designed to not cause basement seepage. To prevent basement seepage, at a minimum, runoff must be directed away from the building foundation and be infiltrated at least 10 feet away from the foundation.\n\n3.The rooftop area contributing runoff to any one downspout and/or the non-rooftop impervious areas draining to any one discharge location cannot exceed 1,000 square feet.\n\n4.The length of the QPA (in feet) shall be equal to or greater than the contributing rooftop area (in square feet) divided by 13.3 and the maximum contributing flow path from non-rooftop impervious areas shall be 75 feet.\n\n5.For non-rooftop runoff, the length of the QPA must be equal to or greater than the length of the contributing impervious area.\n\n6.For roof runoff, the width of the QPA (in feet) shall be equal to or greater than the roof length.\n\n7.For non-roof runoff, the width of the QPA shall be no less than the width of the contributing impervious surface.\n\n8.Although they may abut, there shall be no overlap between QPAs. They shall not be directed to the same area.\n\n9.The lot must be greater than 6,000 square feet.\n\n10.The slope of the QPA shall be less than or equal to 5.0%.\n\n11.Where provided, downspouts must be at least 10 feet away from the nearest impervious surface to prevent reconnection to the stormwater management system.\n\n12.Where provided, downspouts must have appropriate provisions to induce sheet flow.\n\n13.Where a gutter/downspout system is not used, the rooftop runoff must be designed to sheet flow at low velocity away from the structure housing the roof.\n\n14.A DEM-licensed Class IV Soil Evaluator or RI-registered Professional Engineer shall confirm that the depth to the seasonal high groundwater table is 18 inches or greater. The soil evaluation must identify the soil texture, HSG (from US Natural Resources Conservation Service soil maps), and depth to the seasonal high groundwater table.\n\n15.If a QPA is located in less permeable soils (HSG “C”), the water table depth and soil texture shall be evaluated by a DEM-licensed Class IV Soil Evaluator or RI-registered Professional Engineer to determine if a level spreading device is needed to sheet flow stormwater over vegetated surfaces.\n\n16.Runoff from driveways, roadways, and parking lots may be directed over soft shoulders, through curb cuts, or level spreaders to QPAs. Measures must be employed at the discharge point to the QPA to prevent erosion and promote sheet flow.\n\n17.To take credit for rooftop disconnection associated with a LUHPPL, the rooftop runoff must not commingle with runoff from any paved surfaces or activities or areas on the site that may generate higher pollutant loads.\n\n18.The Operation and Maintenance Plan required by § 8.17 of this Part (Minimum Standard 11) must include measures to inspect the QPA at least yearly to remove any deposited sediment.\n\n19.The QPA must be owned or controlled by the property owner.\n\n20.In locations where there is a history of groundwater seepage and/or basement flooding, the credit shall not be utilized.\n\nH.The impervious areas contributing runoff to the QPA can be deducted from the impervious surfaces used to calculate the WQv, and can meet the Rev requirement if enough area is disconnected in accordance with the Percent Area Method, described below.\n\n1.The amount of impervious area that needs to be disconnected to meet the recharge requirement is referred to as the recharge area. It is equivalent to the recharge volume but can be achieved by filtration of sheet flow over a QPA. Recharge area is calculated according to the equation below:\n\n2.If only a portion of the recharge area can be directed to a QPA due to site constraints, a designer must use a structural BMP to recharge the difference. This amount can be determined by the following approach:\n\na.Calculate both the Rev and recharge area for the site;\n\nb.The site impervious area draining to a QPA is subtracted from the recharge area calculation from Credit Step 1, above in § 8.18(H)(1) of this Part;\n\nc.The remaining recharge area is divided by the original recharge area to calculate a pro-rated percentage that must be directed to structural infiltration BMPs; and\n\nd.The pro-rated percentage is multiplied by the original Rev to calculate a new Rev that must be met by an approved structural practice(s).\n\n8.19Structural Stormwater Treatment Practices for Meeting Water Quality -- Overview\n\nA.§§ 8.20 through 8.25 of this Part provide the requirements for acceptable structural BMPs that can be used to meet the water quality criteria in § 8.9 of this Part. Sediment volumes do not need to be calculated for sizing of the BMPs in §§ 8.20 through 8.25 of this Part.\n\nB.Minimum Design Criteria for BMPs: If required design criteria for a particular BMP cannot be met at a site, an alternative BMP must be selected, or adequate justification must be provided to the approving agency why the particular criteria is not practicable. Design requirements are provided for the following 6 categories:\n\n1.Feasibility: Identify site considerations that may restrict the use of a practice.\n\n2.Conveyance: Convey runoff to the practice in a manner that is safe, minimizes erosion and disruption to natural channels, and promotes filtering and infiltration.\n\n3.Pretreatment: Trap coarse elements before they enter the facility, thus reducing the maintenance burden and ensuring a long-lived practice.\n\n4.Treatment/Geometry: Provide the required water quality treatment through design elements that provide the maximum pollutant removal.\n\n5.Environmental/Vegetation: Reduce secondary environmental impacts of facilities through features that minimize disturbance of natural stream systems and comply with environmental regulations. Provide vegetation that enhances the pollutant removal and aesthetic value of the practice.\n\n6.Maintenance: Maintain the long-term performance of the practice through regular maintenance activities, and through design elements that ease the maintenance burden.\n\n8.20Wet Vegetated Treatment Systems (WVTS)\n\nA.Feasibility\n\n1.WVTS designs shall not be located within jurisdictional waters, including wetlands; except that on already developed sites, WTVS designs may be allowed in jurisdictional upland buffers in areas already altered under existing conditions, if acceptable to the approving agency.\n\n2.WVTS designs shall not be located within stream channels in order to prevent habitat degradation caused by these structures.\n\n3.Assess the hazard classification of the structure and consider alternative placement and/or design refinements to reduce or eliminate the potential for the structure being subject to the RI DEM Rules and Regulations for Dam Safety, Part 130-05-1 of this Title.\n\n4.The use of WVTS designs in watersheds draining to cold-water fisheries is restricted to prohibit discharges within 200 feet of streams and any contiguous natural or vegetated wetlands. Discharges beyond 200 feet shall be designed to discharge up to and including the CPv through an underdrained gravel trench outlet. Additional storage for Qp may be discharged through traditional outlet structures.\n\n5.WVTS designs specified to manage LUHPPL runoff require a 3-foot separation to groundwater. All other land uses do not require groundwater separation.\n\n6.The volume below the surface elevation of the permanent pool shall not be included in storage calculations for peak flow management (CPv/Qp).\n\n7.Setbacks for WVTS designs from OWTSs shall be consistent with the setbacks in DEM’s Rules Establishing Minimum Standards Relating to Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems.\n\nB.Conveyance\n\n1.Flow paths from the inflow points to the outflow points of WVTS shall be maximized through the use of BMP geometry and features such as berms and islands.\n\n2.The channel immediately below a WVTS outfall shall be modified to prevent erosion and conform to natural dimensions in the shortest possible distance, typically by use of appropriately sized riprap placed over filter cloth.\n\n3.A stilling basin or outlet protection shall be used to reduce flow velocities from the principal spillway to non-erosive velocities (3.5 to 5.0 feet per second).\n\n4.A subsurface water level must be maintained in the gravel WVTS through the design of the outlet elevation (invert just below the surface). The outlet invert location must be open or vented to prevent a siphon that would drain the WVTS.\n\n5.For discharges beyond 200 feet from streams (and any contiguous natural or vegetated wetlands) in cold-water fisheries, the underdrained gravel trench shall be designed to meet the following requirements:\n\na.Shall be sized to release the CPv over at least 12 hours and not more than 24 hours to provide adequate cooling of stormwater runoff discharging from the WVTS;\n\nb.Shall be 4 feet wide, located at least 2 feet from the WVTS permanent pool, and located at the furthest location opposite from the principal inflow location to the facility;\n\nc.The trench shall have a length of 3 feet per 1,000 cubic feet of CPv storage volume, have a depth of at least 3 feet, and maintain 2 feet of gravel cover over a 6-inch diameter perforated pipe outlet (Rigid Schedule 40 PVC or SDR35);\n\nd.Shall utilize geotextile fabric placed between the gravel trench and adjacent soil; and\n\ne.Shall utilize clean poorly-graded gravel (i.e., uniform stone size).\n\nC.WVTS Liners: When a WVTS is located in medium to coarse sands and above the average groundwater table, a liner shall be used to sustain a permanent pool of water.
