        "text": "Some cities discharge their stormwater into pipes that also receive and convey wastewater or sanitary sewer flows. These types of systems are called combined sewer systems and are most commonly found in older cities; new developments do not build combined sewer systems.\n\nCombined sewer systems are typically connected to wastewater treatment plants that then discharge treated water into a receiving water body. However, during heavy rains, water flows can overwhelm the infrastructure capacity. When pipes and treatment plants are unable to manage the flows, water is discharged directly into receiving water bodies without being treated, in an event called a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO).\n\nDepending upon an agency’s permit requirements with EPA, the number of CSO events that can occur at each overflow point varies. Many agencies that have CSOs exceeding EPA’s overflow thresholds are utilizing bioretention facilities and other green stormwater infrastructure (with and without gray storage facilities) to come into regulatory compliance by reducing the volume of stormwater runoff that reaches the combined system, and therefore reducing the frequency and volume of CSO events.\n\nCurrent gray stormwater infrastructure guidelines require that stormwater runoff be collected and conveyed separately from sanitary sewer lines. In municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), stormwater runoff is often discharged into receiving water bodies with limited or no water quality treatment.\n\nMost cities have MS4 Permits which require new development and redevelopment projects to install water quality treatment facilities and/or flow control facilities prior to discharging runoff into receiving water bodies. The permits may also require retrofits to existing sites or streets to treat and reduce runoff.\n\nVolume Management\n\nSince the volume of stormwater runoff increases as impervious surface area increases, the two major strategies related to volume management are to increase pervious area or to divert runoff into the green infrastructure system. Green stormwater infrastructure systems are designed to convert surface area from impervious to permeable, and reduce the volume of runoff that reaches the sewer system or downstream water bodies, reducing the burden on gray infrastructure systems and infiltrating stormwater runoff directly back into the soil. Green infrastructure projects and programs set specific stormwater volume management goals, such as the first inch of rainfall on a given area."
