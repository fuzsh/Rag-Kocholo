        "text": "Storm Drains and Sewers: As unexpected heavy rainfall is now the norm, it is very important to keep storm drains free of debris at all times. Please make sure fallen leaves do not accumulate near sewers and drains. Call the Village at (914) 834-6965 to report a public storm drain in need of clearing.\n\nFind out more about the Village's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) reports.\n\nDry Wells – if there are dry wells on your property, clear them out frequently so they can receive heavy rain and deter or minimize flooding of your garage or basement. Use the decomposing leaves as mulch beneath shrubs and in flower beds.\n\nTo help protect the environment, public infrastructure, and your property, be sure to avoid illicit discharges on your property. Read more about Illicit Discharges and Stormwater Protection.\n\nLearn what you can about improving stormwater quality by visiting the following websites:\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency - Water Quality\n\nNYS Dept of Environmental Conservation - Stormwater\n\nCenter for Watershed Protection\n\nWestchester County Department of Environmental Facilities\n\nHelp Protect Our Waterways - What NOT to flush down the toiletImproperly disposing of garbage and household refuse can have significant impacts on our rivers, streams, ponds, and Long Island Sound – and can even make flooding in our Town and Village worse. You can help prevent blocked sewer lines, clogged equipment in sewage pump stations, and polluted water if you're careful about what you flush down the toilet, dump in the sink, pour down the storm drain, or onto the ground in your driveway or backyard.\n\nWipes are a major cause of sewer problems. They do not break down on their way through the pipes to the treatment plant. Even if advertised as \"flushable,\" they should be thrown in the garbage, not the toilet.\n\nGrease, oils, and fats. These solidify and can block your own household pipes as well as the sewer line. Collect them in an old jar with a lid, store them in the refrigerator, and throw them in the garbage when full.\n\nChemicals. Everything from paint to anti-freeze, solvents, pesticides, herbicides, kerosene, and motor oil is toxic to our environment.\n\nOther cloggers, such as paper towels, rags, diapers, bandages, band aids, litter and tissues. These should all be thrown in the garbage.\n\nPlastic of any kind. Once it's in the water, Plastic does not break down and has to be physically removed.\n\nPrescription and over-the-counter drugs. Drugs can have major impacts on organisms up and down the food chain, and on us.\n\nShare this page\n\nCopy and paste this code into your website.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.larchmontny.gov/departments/public_works/stormwater_management.php\">Your Link Name</a>\n\nShare this page on your favorite Social network"
