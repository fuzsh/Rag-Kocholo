        "text": "NJDEP Stormwater Management Program\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection oversees the Stormwater Management Program for the State. Municipalities and Counties are required to obtain stormwater permits. The purpose of the stormwater management program is to reduce the pollution impact of stormwater.\n\nIt is estimated that up to 60% of our existing water pollution problems are attributable to stormwater/nonpoint pollution. The Stormwater Management Program attempts to reduce stormwater/nonpoint pollutant contributions through the implementation of best management practices including public education.\n\nHow does this fit in with Clean Communities?\n\nSources of nonpoint source pollution include pesticides, pet wastes, leaves, automotive fluids, and litter. Some of the recommended strategies to reduce nonpoint source pollution from stormwater are similar to the efforts the Clean Communities Coordinators currently undertake. Some ideas for working with the stormwater management personnel in your community may include litter cleanups, stormwater stenciling and providing educational materials regarding litter and other forms of nonpoint source pollution to your residents.\n\nIt should be noted that Counties and other agencies with “highway agencies” permits are required to provide information on their litter pick up programs including the cleanup dates and amounts of litter collected. So be sure to share information on your cleanup events with your stormwater management personnel.\n\nMunicipal Excess Liability Joint Insurance Fund - Pre-Recorded Webinars\n\nNJDEP Related Websites:\n\nNJStormwater.org\n\nClean Water NJ - Education and Outreach Resources\n\nWatershed Restoration - Watershed Information Defined and Explained\n\nWatershed Restoration - Water Education & Outreach Resources\n\nDivision of Water Monitoring and Standards - Bureau of Environmental Analysis, Restoration and Standards Nonpoint Source (NPS) Pollution Management Program - Nonpoint Source Pollution Explained\n\nDivision of Water Quality, Bureau of Stormwater Permitting - Outreach Material (contains items shown below):\n\nSolutions to Stormwater Pollution\n\n(2 page flyer found on NJDEP Example Website)\n\nPDF\n\nWORD\n\nWhat's a Watershed?

It is separated from other watersheds by high points in the areas such as hills or slopes. It includes not only the waterway itself but also the entire land area that drains to it. For example, the watershed of a lake would include not only the streams entering that lake but also the land area that drains into those streams and eventually the lake. Drainage basins generally refer to large watersheds that encompass the watersheds of many smaller rivers and streams.\n\nNo matter where you are in New Jersey, you are in a watershed. Watersheds are everywhere from your front doorstep to the local park to the shopping mall to the creek down the road. Watersheds are the link between our land, our water and our communities because the quality of our water is linked to how we use the watershed surrounding it.\n\nTo learn more about watersheds please visit the NJDEP Watershed Restoration site\n\nNew Jersey has five watershed regions:\n\nAtlantic Coastal\n\nLower Delaware\n\nNortheast\n\nNorthwest\n\nRaritan\n\nNew Jersey has 20 watershed management areas:\n\n01 Upper Delaware\n\n02 Wallkill\n\n03 Pompton, Pequannock, Wanaque, Ramapo\n\n04 Lower Passaic, Saddle\n\n05 Hackensack, Hudson, Pascack\n\n06 Upper and Mid Passaic, Whippany and Rockaway\n\n07 Arthur Kill\n\n08 North and South Branch Raritan\n\n09 Lower Raritan, South River, and Lawrence\n\n10 Millstone\n\n11 Central Delaware\n\n12 Monmouth\n\n13 Barnegat Bay\n\n14 Mullica\n\n15 Great Egg Harbor\n\n16 Cape May\n\n17 Maurice, Salem and Cohansey\n\n18 Lower Delaware\n\n19 Rancocas\n\n20 Assiscunk, Crosswicks and Doctors\n\nWatershed Ambassadors\n\n“The New Jersey Watershed Ambassador Program is a community-oriented AmeriCorps program designed to raise awareness about water issues in New Jersey. Through this program, Watershed Ambassadors are placed at local host sites in twenty (20) Watershed Management Areas (WMAs) from Sussex to Cape May counties to serve their local communities. Three Source Water Protection (SWP) Ambassadors are placed in north, central, and south locations and will engage in outreach and education campaigns that will lead to the protection of drinking water sources. The program works with all sectors of society to improve the quality of New Jersey’s waterways, nurturing community-based environmental activities and empowering residents to make responsible and informed decisions regarding their watershed. Watershed Ambassadors are available to make FREE environmental education presentations to community organizations and schools.”\n\nFind Your Watershed Ambassador"
