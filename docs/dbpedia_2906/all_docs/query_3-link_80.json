        "text": "Stormwater management is necessary to reduce combined sewer overflow (CSO) in combined sewer areas of the city and reduce pollution in waterways in the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) areas of the city. New York City manages stormwater through “gray” infrastructure including tanks and pipes or “green” infrastructure (GI) practices which mimic the way the natural environment handles stormwater. GI practices typically manage stormwater via infiltration through soil and evaporation through vegetation. GI practices can also provide co-benefits such as reduced flooding, improved air quality, attractive streetscapes, traffic calming, and more.\n\nUsing natural components, such as plants, stones, and soils, to mitigate the impacts of stormwater runoff is an ecologically responsible and economical technique to employ within the public ROW. DEP, together with DOT, Parks, and DDC, developed standardized designs and protocols to site GI practices within the public ROW. These standards along with other helpful guidance can be found on DEP's Green Infrastructure web page.\n\nThe following sections describe specific city-led strategies for managing stormwater in targeted areas that have the greatest need. These practices will be built and maintained by the city within priority areas of combined- (CSO) and separately-sewered (MS4) areas.\n\nThe city will site the appropriate standard treatment based on visible site conditions (grading, location of catch basins, tributary drainage area, pedestrian volumes, built fabric context) as well as subsurface conditions (permeability, site contamination, water table, etc.).\n\nPrivate entities or community groups are also encouraged to build green infrastructure, but those installations will require a maintenance agreement. Private entities may choose to build standard stormwater management practices or to pursue unique installations. Treatments other than city standards will require more intensive review, but are still encouraged."
