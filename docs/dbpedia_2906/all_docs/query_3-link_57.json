        "text": "PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION\n\nThe goal of this program is to ensure that stakeholders from throughout the University have an opportunity to participate in the development and implementation of the University’s Stormwater Management Program. The University conducts quarterly Stormwater Management Advisory Committee (SMAC) meetings with a variety of stakeholders to evaluate the University’s Stormwater Management Program and discuss current challenges and opportunities. Students can get involved by participating in one or more of the environmental groups on campus such as: Sustainability Stewards, Environmental Student Association, or Zero Waste Wolves.\n\nStorm Water Management Plan\n\nNPDES MS4 Permit\n\nFor more opportunities, visit the Get Involved at NC State website.\n\n2024 Scheduled SMAC Meetings\n\nMarch 7th 9:45 AM\n\nMay 30th 10 AM\n\nAugust 7th 2 PM\n\nNovember 6th 2:30 PM\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all meetings will be held in the EHSC Training Room.\n\nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination\n\nThe goal of this program is to prevent the discharge of contaminated stormwater runoff from University properties into the storm sewer system and local lakes and streams. The University’s program includes a minimum of semi-annual screening of all campus storm water outfalls. Additionally, University Facilities employees respond to reports of illicit discharges/spills on campus; they take all necessary actions to clean up the discharge/spill and complete source investigations and make any necessary repairs to prevent future illicit discharges. Call 919-515-3000 to report a discharge/spill to ground or surface waters on campus.\n\nPost-Construction Stormwater Management\n\nThe goal of this program is to minimize the adverse effects of development by implementing post-construction requirements to accomplish the following: minimize downstream flooding and erosion, remove pollutants (sediment, nutrients, bacteria, and heavy metals), and encourage infiltration of rainfall to replenish groundwater and maintain stable base flow in streams. The University’s program requires peak flow attenuation, runoff volume control, and nutrient management criteria to be addressed during the design phase of each project; most often these requirements are met by installing a stormwater control measure (SCM). The University maintains over 100 SCMs on campus; these include bioretention devices, stormwater wetlands, wet ponds, dry ponds, green roofs, grassed swales, level spreaders, and sand filters."
