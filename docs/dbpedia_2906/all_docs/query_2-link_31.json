        "text": "Infiltration Overview\n\nNatural or constructed depressions located in permeable soils that capture, store and infiltrate the volume of stormwater runoff associated with a particular design event.\n\nDesign Criteria:\n\nContributing drainage area\n\nUnderlying soil types\n\nDepth to the water table, bedrock or other impeding layer\n\nProximity to buildings, drinking water supplies, Karst features, etc.\n\nSource of stormwater runoff\n\nWarning: To avoid an infiltration trench being classified as a Class V injection well, it is strongly recommended that the length of the trench be at least 2 times greater than the depth of the trench.\n\nBenefits\n\nReduces volume of stormwater runoff\n\nIncreases ground water recharge\n\nImproves surface water quality\n\nProvides thermal benefits (e.g. to cold water fisheries)\n\nMimics pre-development hydrology\n\nLimitations\n\nUnusual construction considerations\n\nPotential for ground water contamination\n\nTendency to lose effectiveness over time due to clogging â€“ if not properly constructed or maintained\n\nNot recommended for areas with steep slopes\n\nMay require landscaping: consideration should be given to periods on inundation and drought\n\nDescription\n\nIn general terms, infiltration systems can be described as natural or constructed depressions located in permeable soils that capture, store and infiltrate stormwater runoff within 48 hours. These depressions can be located at the surface of the ground (e.g. infiltration basin) or they can be designed as underground facilities (e.g. structural chamber or excavated pit filled with aggregate such as an infiltration trench). Typically, infiltration systems are designed with one or more pre-treatment facilities or they are designed as off-line facilities.\n\nWarning: Infiltration systems should be located in permeable soils and a minimum 3-foot distance is REQUIRED from the bottom of the infiltration system to the seasonally high water table, bedrock or other impeding layer per the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Construction General Permit (CGP)]\n\nDry wells and Trenches should be designed to handle the smaller, more frequent rainfall events. Stormwater associated with the larger rainfall events should bypass these practices by a separate pipe or an overflow device. Infiltration basins and underground infiltration systems should be designed to handle both the water quality volume and as the water quantity volume.\n\nInfiltration systems can be designed to address a number of stormwater management issues including: water quality, stormwater runoff reduction, flow attenuation, thermal impacts to cold water fisheries, and groundwater recharge.\n\nMaintenance Requirements\n\nEstablishment of native vegetation may require weeding, watering, pumping, replacement of plants and tree/shrub trimming\n\nInspection and removal of sediment accumulation\n\nStreet sweeping of impervious areas adjacent to infiltration practices\n\nAvoid the application of fertilizer or herbicide in or near infiltration practices\n\nSITE FACTORS\n\nMax Drainage Areas: Dry Well/ Trench/ Basin = 1/ 5/ 50 Acres\n\nMax. Site Slope = 20 percent\n\nMin. Depth to Bedrock = 3 feet\n\nMin. Depth to Seasonally High Water Table = 3 feet\n\nNRCS Soil Type *C & D soils have limited infiltration ability but can be used to match predevelopment conditions = A,B,C*,& D\n\nFreeze/ Thaw Suitability = Poor - Good\n\nPotential Hotspot Runoff = NO\n\nMANAGEMENT SUITABILITY\n\nWater Quality (Vwq) = High\n\nMed. Channel Protection (Vcp)\n\nOverbank Flood Protection (Vp10) = Low/Med.\n\nExtreme Flood Protection (Vp100) = Low\n\nRecharge Volume (Vre) = High\n\nMECHANISMS\n\nScreening/ Filtration\n\nTemperature Control\n\nTranspiration *if vegetated\n\nSoil Adsorption\n\nBiological/ Micro. Uptake\n\nPOLLUTION REMOVAL*\n\nTotal Suspended Solids (TSS) = 100 percent\n\nNutrients - Total Phosphorus/ = 100 percent\n\nTotal Nitrogen = 100 percent\n\nMetals - Cadmium, Copper, Lead, and Zinc = 100 percent\n\nPathogens - Coliform, Streptococci, E.
