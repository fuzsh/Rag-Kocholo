        "text": "The most effective way to manage stormwater begins with the prevention of problems. Non-structural BMPs include design approaches and practices that are used for their ability to prevent the occurrence of stormwater runoff. Utilizing non-structural BMPs during site development is much more efficient and cost-effective than attempting to correct problems after development has occurred. Read below to learn about specific types of non-structural BMPs.\n\nRiparian Corridors/Buffers\n\nA riparian corridor includes a body of water (stream, river, pond or lake), its lower and upper banks, and the vegetation that stabilizes the area of land adjacent to the body of water. This area of land adjacent to the body of water can also be referred to as a “riparian buffer”. This corridor or buffer is important because natural trees and vegetation can filter out air and water pollution, roots from tree and other vegetation can hold the soil in place providing protection from significant erosion and sedimentation, provide cover and shade, provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife, and can provide flood water retention.\n\nPreservation and restoration of riparian corridor/buffers has been identified as one of the most important ways to protect and improve water quality by government and state agencies.\n\nProtect Sensitive and Special Value Features\n\nSpecial Value Features are those that provide exceptional value stormwater benefits. Examples include riparian areas, wetlands, hydric soils, and floodplains. Sensitive Features are those that are exceptionally vulnerable to stormwater damage. Examples include steep slopes and neighboring properties. Damage to both special value and sensitive features can exacerbate stormwater volume, rate, and quality problems. When developing a site, special attention should be paid to these areas.\n\nProtect / Utilize Natural Flow Pathways in Overall Stormwater Planning and Design\n\nSites usually have areas where stormwater is being stored and/or conveyed prior to development. These features should be identified and preserved during planning and construction in order to minimize the impacts of stormwater. The preservation of such features can reduce the need for structural BMPs.\n\nCluster Uses at Each Site and Build on Smallest Area Possible\n\nThrough clustering uses at each site and building on the smallest area possible, additional runoff that is generated through the development process is minimized. Additional benefits of this design approach include the preservation of open space, the minimization of impervious area, and many others. Practical examples of this non-structural BMP include reducing lot size and building vertically.\n\nUse Smart Growth Practices\n\nSmart Growth practices are typically used at the community, municipal, or multi-municipal level. This planning technique guides growth towards parcels that are most desirable for this use. The PA Stormwater BMP Manual describes this particular BMP as “Super Clustering.” Smart Growth employs similar methods on a macro scale as clustering does on a micro (site) scale. Tools used in Smart Growth include urban growth boundaries, agricultural zoning, transfer of development rights, donation of conservation easement by owners, and many more.\n\nMinimize Total Disturbed Area–Grading\n\nThis design approach works with the existing site topography instead of against it. By reducing the need for site grading, soil disturbance, and removal of vegetation, this planning and development approach aims to prevent the generation of stormwater. Additional benefits of Minimizing Total Disturbed Areas & Grading include reduction of areas that need to be landscaped and maintained.\n\nMinimize Soil Compaction\n\nMinimizing soil compaction and maintaining topsoil quality during construction provides numerous stormwater benefits. Stormwater benefits of this practice include: minimizing runoff and erosion, maximizing water retention capacity, filtering of stormwater, and reducing resources needed to maintain landscaping.\n\nRe-Vegetate and Re-Forest Disturbed Areas\n\nDisturbed areas should be re-vegetated with native plants, grasses, shrubs, and trees. Since these species are adapted to local climate and conditions, they require less fertilizers and pesticides and have better chances of surviving. Stormwater benefits of established native plantings include runoff volume and rate reduction as well as water quality improvements.\n\nReduce Street Imperviousness and Parking Imperviousness\n\nThe benefits of reducing impervious areas for streets and parking through innovative planning are numerous. Benefits include: increased infiltration, decreased stormwater volume, pollutant load reduction, and preservation of natural habitats.\n\nRooftop Disconnection\n\nRooftop disconnection is also known as downspout disconnection. Disconnecting rooftop leaders from the storm sewer system and re-directing towards vegetated areas is an effective way to manage stormwater volume. This BMP can be more effective when the flow is directed towards a structural BMP such as a rain garden.\n\nDisconnection from Storm Sewers\n\nDisconnecting stormwater generated from impervious areas, such as roads and driveways, from storm sewers and directing towards structural BMPs, such as bio-infiltration areas, is effective in many ways. Managing the flow near the source instead of sending downstream via traditional piping allows for increased infiltration and evapotranspiration, increased filtration, and decreased runoff volume.\n\nStreetsweeping\n\nStreetsweeping is a form of source control that is key to ensuring the function of stormwater facilities and keeps local waterways free of debris and other pollutants. In order for streetsweeping to be effective, the equipment used should have a vacuum filter.\n\nFor resources related to non-structural BMPs, visit our Stormwater Resources page.\n\nInfiltration Basins and Infiltration Trenches Infiltration devices drain or infiltrate water directly into the ground, providing opportunity for groundwater recharge. Infiltration facilities are below ground; the length of time that water is allowed to be on the surface is determined by municipal codes.\n\nDry Wells\n\nDry wells collect and infiltrate roof runoff at gutter downspouts, roof valleys, and other places where large amounts of concentrated water flow off of a roof. The water is conveyed typically through an underground pipe into an excavated pit (the dry well). They help reduce erosion on your property and can reduce ponding and sitting water.\n\nRain Barrels\n\nA rain barrel is a device to collect rainwater from downspouts. Rain barrels can be purchased or can be made at home. They come in all sizes and shapes. Some benefits of rain barrels include: reduction of stormwater runoff, promotion of local watershed awareness, education of neighbors about stormwater issues, lowered water bill by reducing metered water usage, and water reuse for landscaping, washing, etc.\n\nRain Gardens\n\nA rain garden is a landscaped area planted with wildflowers and other native vegetation that is used to soak up rainwater from the roof, driveway, and lawn. The water slowly seeps into the ground instead of heading for the nearest storm drain. A rain garden allows for significantly more water to soak into the ground than a conventional lawn.\n\nPervious Pavement\n\nPorous asphalt, porous concrete, and porous pavers are all types of pervious pavements. These are typically used with infiltration beds below the pervious surfaces, which allow for the temporary stormwater storage and infiltration into the ground. These technologies are used for stormwater peak rate control.\n\nSubsurface Infiltration Bed\n\nTemporary storage and infiltration can be attained when including subsurface infiltration beds underneath vegetated surfaces. Subsurface infiltration beds are typically filled with stones (for void space) and wrapped in geotextile fabric. Subsurface infiltration beds work well in large and generally flat spaces that are located downhill from impervious areas.\n\nVegetated Swale\n\nVegetated swales, also known as bioswales, are broad channels that are densely planted with vegetation. Designed to attenuate and sometimes infiltrate flow, vegetated swales provide peak rate control and also allow for pollutants to settle out, therefore improving water quality. In sloped areas, check dams are needed to enhance the stormwater management functions of vegetated swales.\n\nVegetated Filter Strip\n\nVegetated Filter Strips, also called buffer strips, are areas in between sources of nonpoint source pollutants and the receiving body of water. They can include native or indigenous vegetation such as grasses, shrubs, and trees. Turf grasses are also used sometimes but their functionality in stormwater management is limited. The primary stormwater function of vegetated filter strips is water quality improvement, however, some volume reduction and ground water recharge can occur depending on site conditions such as soil and slope.\n\nConstructed Filter\n\nA constructed stormwater filter is a structure or excavated area that is filled with material that filters stormwater. These devices can be designed to filter floatables, sediments, metals, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants. There are many variations on the constructed filter, including vegetated and non-vegetated, infiltration, contained, subsurface, and linear perimeter filters.\n\nInfiltration Berm & Retentive Grading\n\nInfiltration berms are linear landscape features that are parallel to existing site contours in areas with moderate slopes. They are earthen embankments that divert, retain, slow down, divert, and promote the infiltration of stormwater. Berms are most effective in areas that receive runoff from small impervious areas. Retentive grading creates small depressions that store and infiltrate stormwater.\n\nVegetated Roof\n\nVegetated Roofs are roofs that are covered with specialized media and planted with vegetation; this enables the roof to hydrologically perform in a manner similar to vegetated surfaces. The media holds water, which is eventually evapotranspired by the plants. The primary function of the vegetated roof in stormwater management is volume reduction. Additional stormwater benefits include water quality improvements and some peak rate control. Environmental benefits beyond stormwater control include building temperature moderation and wildlife habitat.\n\nRunoff Capture & Reuse\n\nRunoff Capture and Reuse refers to the variety of techniques that are used to capture precipitation, store it for a period of time, and reuse the water. Devices used to capture and store stormwater include rain barrels, cisterns, vertical storage mechanisms, and below ground storage systems. These BMPs are most effective for use in controlling small, frequent storm events. Stormwater management benefits of runoff capture and reuse devices include volume reduction, water quality improvements, peak rate control, and groundwater recharge.\n\nConstructed Wetland\n\nConstructed Wetlands (CWs), also known as stormwater wetlands, are shallow aquatic systems planted with emergent vegetation. They are highly effective at removing pollutants from stormwater; they also mitigate peak flow rates and reduce runoff volume. Beyond stormwater management, CWs provide wildlife habitat and aesthetic value. Detention Basins, a basic BMP that temporarily stores stormwater, are often retrofitted into CWs in order to maximize stormwater management function of the space and obtain the added benefits.\n\nWet Pond/Retention Basin\n\nWet Ponds (WPs), also called retention basins, are stormwater basins that include a permanent pool of water, as well as additional capacity for the temporary storage of stormwater. They are very effective at controlling peak stormwater rates and also provide water quality benefits. Beyond stormwater management, WPs can also provide aesthetic and wildlife benefits.\n\nDry Extended Detention Basin\n\nDry Extended Detention Basins (DEDBs) are detention basins, which are designed to provide temporary stormwater storage and water quality benefits. The temporary storage of stormwater prevents downstream flooding. Water quality benefits are achieved through sediment settling out of the stormwater while held in the DEDB. DEDBs are often used in conjunction with other BMPs to maximize stormwater management benefits on site. The DEDB is a design enhancement from the Dry Detention Basin, which has been popular since the 1970s. The extended detention of stormwater maximizes water quality benefits.\n\nWater Quality Filters & Hydrodynamic Devices\n\nWater Quality Filters are stormwater inlets that are fitted with devices to filter pollutants from stormwater. Hydrodynamic devices are separate from inlets, but serve the same function of filtering pollutants. Both Water Quality Filters and Hydrodynamic Devices rely on some form of settling and filtration to remove pollutants from runoff. There are numerous variations available commercially.\n\nRiparian Buffer Restoration\n\nRiparian Buffer Restoration (RBR) is the restoration of the area surrounding streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. The restoration of these areas provides numerous stormwater management benefits, including water quality improvement, volume reduction, groundwater recharge, and peak rate control. Ecological benefits beyond stormwater management are numerous, including providing wildlife habitat and providing aesthetic value.\n\nLandscape Restoration\n\nLandscape Restoration is the term used for the implementation of sustainable landscape practices outside of the Riparian Buffer and/or other specially protected areas. Landscape Restoration can include forest restoration, meadow restoration, and the conversion of turf to meadow. Native plants should be used and the use of pesticides and herbicides should be eliminated, if possible.\n\nSoil Amendment & Restoration\n\nThe Soil Amendment & Restoration BMP refers to the process of improving disturbed soils. By reducing compaction and adding organic materials, stormwater infiltration and pollutant removal capacity can be greatly increased. In addition to the added stormwater capacity of the soil itself, soil amendment and restoration improves conditions for growing vegetation, which further improves stormwater management.\n\nFloodplain Restoration\n\nFloodplain Restoration aims to restore a floodplain to conditions present prior to development (pre-1600s). It is a system-based BMP that strives to mimic undisturbed conditions between groundwater, stream base flow, and vegetation. Floodplain Restoration provides substantial water quality and quantity stormwater management benefits.\n\nLevel Spreader\n\nLevel spreaders are a structural BMP that are designed to reduce the erosive energy of stormwater. Examples of Level Spreaders include earthen berms, level perforated pipes, or concrete curbs. Level spreaders are often used in conjunction with other BMPs such as Filter Strips. Filter Strips function significantly better when stormwater is distributed across the BMP.\n\nSpecial Detention Areas The implementation of Special Detention Areas entails using spaces that are not typically utilized for stormwater management, such as parking lots, to temporarily detain stormwater. A flow control structure is typically used to allow runoff to a pond. This BMP is specifically used to control peak rate volume and is more effective when combined with other BMPs that address water quality and volume reduction.\n\nFor more information on Structural Stormwater BMPs, visit our Stormwater Resources page."
