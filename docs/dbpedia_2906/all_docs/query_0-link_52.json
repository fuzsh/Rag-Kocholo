Strictly speaking, excessively drained soils are a result of excessive runoff due to steep slopes or low available water-holding capacity due to small amounts of silt and clay in the soil material. The following classes are used to express soil drainage:\n\nWell drained - Excess water drains away rapidly and no mottling occurs within 36 inches of the surface.\n\nModerately well drained - Water is removed from the soil somewhat slowly, resulting in small but significant periods of wetness. Mottling occurs between 18 and 36 inches.\n\nSomewhat poorly drained - Water is removed from the soil slowly enough to keep it wet for significant periods but not all of the time. Mottling occurs between 8 and 18 inches.\n\nPoorly drained - Water is removed so slowly that the soil is wet for a large part of the time. Mottling occurs between 0 and 8 inches.\n\nVery poorly drained - Water is removed so slowly that the water table remains at or near the surface for the greater part of the time. There may also be periods of surface ponding. The soil has a black to gray surface layer with mottles up to the surface.\n\nDry Season\n\nMay 1 to September 30.\n\nE\n\nEarth material\n\nAny rock, natural soil or fill and/or any combination thereof.

Most storm water discharges are considered point sources and require coverage by an NPDES permit. The primary method to control storm water discharges is through the use of best management practices.\n\nPollution\n\nContamination or other alteration of the physical, chemical, or biological properties, of waters of the state, including change in temperature, taste, color, turbidity, or odor of the waters, or such\n\ndischarge of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive or other substance into any waters of the state as will or is likely to create a nuisance or render such waters harmful, detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety or welfare, or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, or other legitimate beneficial uses, or to livestock, wild animals, birds, fish, or other aquatic life.\n\nPollution-generating hard surface (PGHS)\n\nThose hard surfaces considered to be a significant source of pollutants in stormwater runoff.

Usually this includes the construction over water or within a shoreline zone (generally 200 feet landward of the water) of structures such as buildings, piers, bulkheads, and breakwaters, including environmental alterations such as dredging and filling, or any project which interferes with public navigational rights on the surface waters.\n\nSite\n\nThe area defined by the legal boundaries of a parcel or parcels of land that is (are) subject to new development or redevelopment. For road projects, the length of the project site and the right-of-way boundaries define the site.\n\nSlope\n\nDegree of deviation of a surface from the horizontal; measured as a numerical ratio, percent, or in degrees. Expressed as a ratio, the first number is the horizontal distance (run) and the second is the vertical distance (rise), as 2:1. A 2:1 slope is a 50 percent slope. Expressed in degrees, the slope is the angle from the horizontal plane, with a 90° slope being vertical (maximum) and 45° being a 1:1 or 100 percent slope.\n\nSoil\n\nThe unconsolidated mineral and organic material on the immediate surface of the earth that serves as a natural medium for the growth of land plants.

The basic texture classes in the approximate order of increasing proportions of fine particles include: sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silt, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and clay.\n\nSorption\n\nThe physical or chemical binding of pollutants to sediment or organic particles.\n\nSphagnum bog wetlands\n\nUnique wetlands having a predominance of sphagnum moss creating a substrate upon which a distinctive community of plants is established. Some of these include ledum groenlandicum (Labrador tea), Kalmia occidentalis (bog laurel), Drosera rotundifolia (sundew), and Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry). Stunted evergreen trees are also sometimes present. In addition to a distinctive plant community, the water chemistry of sphagnum wetlands is also unique. It is characterized by acidic waters (pH 3 to 5.5), low nutrient content, low alkalinity, and a buffering system composed predominantly of organic acids. In the Puget Sound area, mature sphagnum bog wetlands are typically very old, often dating back thousands of years.\n\nSteep slope\n\nSlopes of 40 percent gradient or steeper within a vertical elevation change of at least ten feet. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top, and is measured by averaging the inclination over at least ten feet of vertical relief. For the purpose of this definition: The toe of a slope is a distinct topographic break in slope that separates slopes inclined at less than 40% from slopes 40% or steeper. Where no distinct break exists, the toe of a steep slope is the lowermost limit of the area where the ground surface drops ten feet or more vertically within a horizontal distance of 25 feet;\n\nAND\n\nThe top of a slope is a distinct topographic break in slope that separates slopes inclined at less than 40% from slopes 40% or steeper. Where no distinct break exists, the top of a steep slope is the uppermost limit of the area where the ground surface drops ten feet or more vertically within a horizontal distance of 25 feet.\n\nStorage routing\n\nA method to account for the attenuation of peak flows passing through a detention facility or other storage feature.\n\nStorm drain system\n\nThe system of gutters, pipes, streams, or ditches used to carry surface and storm water from surrounding lands to streams, lakes, or Puget Sound. Also see Conveyance System.\n\nStorm drains\n\nThe enclosed conduits that transport surface and stormwater runoff toward points of discharge (sometimes called storm sewers).\n\nStorm frequency\n\nThe time interval between major storms of predetermined intensity and volumes of runoff for which storm sewers and other structures are designed and constructed to handle hydraulically without surcharging and backflooding; e.g., a 2-year, 10-year or 100-year storm.\n\nStorm sewer\n\nA sewer that carries stormwater and surface water, street wash and other wash waters or drainage, but excludes sewage and industrial wastes. Also called a storm drain.\n\nStormwater\n\nStormwater is the water that runs off surfaces such as rooftops, paved streets, highways, and parking lots. It can also come from hard grassy surfaces like lawns, play fields, and from graveled roads and parking lots.\n\nStormwater drainage system\n\nConstructed and natural features which function together as a system to collect, convey, channel, hold, inhibit, retain, detain, infiltrate, divert, treat or filter stormwater.\n\nStormwater facility\n\nFacilities that control the discharge of stormwater and that remove pollutants make up the bulk of the structural solutions applied to surface water problems in King County. Stormwater facilities included storage facilities (ponds, vaults, underground tanks, and infiltration systems); water quality facilities (wetponds, biofiltration swales, constructed wetlands, sand filters, and oil/water separators); and conveyance systems (ditches, pipes, and catchbasins).\n\nThese systems are most often built-in conjunction with new development, but include regional facilities designed and constructed by the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nOnce constructed, stormwater facilities require on-going maintenance to ensure they continue to perform as intended. Maintenance of storage facilities typically includes the removal of accumulated sediment and debris, routine mowing, and minor repairs to mechanical appurtenances. Management of water quality facilities is more complex, requiring intensive vegetation management, inspection and maintenance of flow control features, and restoration or replacement of filter media. King County plays an active role in the management of three categories of stormwater facilities: residential, commercial, and regional. These three terms are defined in the following paragraphs.\n\nStormwater Facility, Regional\n\nIn King County, regional stormwater facilities are constructed and/or managed by DNR's WLR Division. They typically serve large areas with a variety of land uses, and are intended to address problems resulting from large storm events. Examples of regional facilities include pump stations, regional storage facilities, sedimentation ponds, and enclosed drainage systems. These facilities are inspected annually and maintained by DNR's WLR Division.\n\nStormwater Facility, Residential\n\nAs defined by King County, residential stormwater facilities typically serve all or part of a single development and are built on a tract dedicated to this purpose. While the design and construction of these facilities is the responsibility of the developer, King County ultimately assumes responsibility for their long-term operation and maintenance.\n\nStormwater Facility, Commercial\n\nIn King County, commercial developments (which include businesses, apartments, and condominiums) are subject to stormwater management regulations that are similar to those applied to residential developments. However, unlike stormwater facilities in single family residential neighborhoods, commercial facilities remain the property and responsibility of the commercial landowner or manager.\n\nKing County staff conduct annual inspections of commercial facilities to identify maintenance needs for the property managers. In return for completion of the necessary maintenance, property owners receive a discount on their annual Surface Water Management (SWM) fees. Without this inspection service, commercial facilities often do not receive adequate maintenance.\n\nStormwater facilities regulated by the Permittee\n\nPermanent stormwater treatment and flow control BMPs/facilities located in the geographic area covered by the permit and which are not owned by the Permittee, and are known by the permittee to discharge into MS4 owned or operated by the Permittee.\n\nStormwater Management\n\nThe application of site design principles and construction techniques to prevent sediments and other pollutants from entering surface or ground water; source controls; and treatment of runoff to reduce pollution.\n\nStormwater site plan\n\nThe comprehensive report containing all of the technical information and analysis necessary for regulatory agencies to evaluate a proposed new development or redevelopment project for compliance with stormwater requirements. Contents of the Stormwater Site Plan will vary with the type and size of the project, and individual site characteristics. It includes a Construction Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (Construction SWPPP) and a Permanent Stormwater Control Plan (PSC Plan). Guidance on preparing a Stormwater Site Plan is contained in Chapter 3 of Volume I.\n\nStormwater treatment and flow control BMPs/facilities\n\nDetention facilities, treatment BMPs/facilities, bioretention, vegetated roofs, and permeable pavements that help meet minimum requirement #6 (treatment), #7 (flow control), or both.\n\nSMP (or SWMP)\n\nStormwater Management Program\n\nStorm drain system\n\nThe system of gutters, pipes, streams, or ditches used to carry surface and storm water from surrounding lands to streams, lakes, or Puget Sound. Also see Conveyance System.\n\nStructural BMP\n\nConstructed facilities or measures to help protect receiving water quality and control stormwater quantity. Examples include storage, vegetation, infiltration, and filtration.\n\nSubgrade\n\nA layer soil used as the underlying base for a BMP.\n\nSubsoil\n\nThe B horizons of soils with distinct profiles. In soils with weak profile development, the subsoil can be defined as the soil below the plowed soil (or its equivalent of surface soil), in which roots normally grow. Although a common term, it cannot be defined accurately. It has been carried over from early days when \"soil\" was conceived only as the plowed soil and that under it as the \"subsoil.\"\n\nSubstrate\n\nThe natural soil base underlying a BMP.\n\nSubstrates\n\nThe base on which an organism lives.\n\nSurface Water Design Manual\n\nThe manual (and supporting documents as appropriate) describing surface and storm water design and analysis requirements, procedures, and guidance which has been formally adopted by rule under the procedures specified in KCC 2.98. The Surface Water Design Manual is available from the King County Department of Development and Environmental Services or the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nSuspended solids\n\nOrganic or inorganic particles that are suspended in and carried by the water. The term includes sand, mud, and clay particles (and associated pollutants) as well as solids in stormwater.\n\nSwale\n\nA shallow drainage conveyance with relatively gentle side slopes, generally with flow depths less than one foot.\n\nSWMP (or SMP)\n\nStormwater Management Program"
