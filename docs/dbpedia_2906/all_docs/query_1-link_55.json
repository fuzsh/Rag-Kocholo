        "text": "My roof downspouts at my house (about 1400-1500 sq ft) on the left and right side are both connected to PVC drainage that go to two separate dry wells. The dry well is about 4 feet deep and itself is buried about 1 foot deep with pvc pipe connecting to it. The top of the dry well is covered with washed gravel wrapped in landscape fabric about 6\" deep below the soil, with a pvc inspection pipe (with perforated holes) and PVC cover fitting that you can unscrew to inspect the drywell connected to the top.\n\nThe dry wells have an overflow connection back to the downspout where the PVC drains to daylight at the back of the yard to a community stormwater management pond. The reason is that if the dry well fills due to a heavy storm runoff, any excess needs to be drained to daylight.\n\nThe connections from the downspout is basically as follows.\n\n1. 2x3\" to 4\" PVC downspout adapter\n\n2. 4x4x4\" wye PVC fitting with the wye part inverted. This acts as a cleanout port to clear clogs. This is all above grade level.\n\n3a. Another 4x4x4\" wye PVC fitting angled down that acts as the overflow to daylight. If the dry well fills and the water raises up to the level of that wye connection, the excess water will flow out this connection.\n\n3b. The 4x4x4\" wye part of the 3a PVC connection is connected to a 45 deg elbow and then PVC to daylight at the community stormwater management pond with 1/8 to 1/4\" grade. This connection is a straight shot in parallel to the side of the house.\n\n4. The bottom connection of the wye PVC fitting is then sent to a 90 deg elbow to a drywell 10-12 feet from the property (angled 45 deg laterally away from the side of the house downward slope to the dry well inlet).\n\nThere were some small PVC connector pieces, but I don't remember how long they were.\n\nI didn't do the install myself, but I had an issue where the soil directly on top of the drywell settled after 8 years or so and had a 4x4' by 2-3\" pool of water in heavy rainfall that would collect on top of one of my dry wells. It didn't stay long, usually went away in a few hours, but I don't like any standing water near my house. I also was digging a trench for electrical conduit and did some exploration since I was doing the dirty work and used the trench dirt to fix the settling over the dry wells and do some re-grading.\n\nThe stormwater management pond itself has an overflow protection that drains to a pond further away from the development.\n\nI also have a walk-out basement and I can say that I don't think I've heard the sump pump run once since I've been in the house, so something must be working.

I also have a walk out basement and the first winter when we purchased the house I had some issues with water at the basement door. Nothing inside but too close for my liking.\n\nI chose to go with the dry wells because we have very sandy soil which is great for dispersing the water but it takes more time to get through the sod and topsoil before it ever gets to the sand beneath which was causing severe standing water issues within the first couple of months of owning the house. That is when I decided to implement the dry wells. I went with the NDS plastic commercially available ones with some extra aggregate surrounding them and underneath. The dry wells sit on approx. 18\" of 3/4\" aggregate with another foot of 3/4\" aggregate around the perimeter of the dry well. The dry well's top is about 14-18 inches beneath the surface with a layer of aggregate immediately on top of the dry well followed by thick plastic landscaping barrier to keep surface water from getting into the dry well and about 10-12 inches of topsoil then the sod on top of all of that.\n\nFor a normal rain storm or even a couple days of drizzling rain the dry well is able to expel the water at a constant rate and the water level stays around the top quarter of the dry well. It is when we get those hard downpour rain storms that last a day plus that the dry well fills up and overflows slightly. Once the rain subsides however, the water does as well and the water level in the dry well continues to drop.\n\nThe dry wells may not work for everyone but they sure work well on my property allowing the water to get to the sandy soil timely enough as to not pool on the surface.\n\nHi. This seems like a good idea. I found a picture online. Do you guys think this idea would work?\n\nLast year I installed an nds dry well which is the same thing you have pictured except there is a plastic container inside of the rock well to create a sort of holding tank to allow the water to accumulate in heavy rain events. It worked well through the winter rains.\n\nTwo super important things to note. This system will not work with clay soils. You need to perform a perc test and make sure your soil will disperse the water and not hold it. Instructions should be on the nds site. Also, make sure the downspout drains into a catch basin and not directly into the pipe. This will help prevent debris from entering the dry well. I even installed a filter inside of the catch basin and clean it out a couple times a year. The filter get clogged but I’d rather that get clogged than the dry well.\n\npic of the catch basin to the dry well. Didn’t get a picture of the actual well itself.\n\nAttachments\n\nF6E24B96-336B-46A3-AA76-F60F6F64A12E.jpeg\n\nMerlinsBeard, that is very similar to how I did mine with a few variations.
