As a result, stormwater runoff can pick up and deposit pollutants such as trash, chemicals, oils, and dirt/sediment that can harm our ocean and coastline. To protect these resources, communities, construction companies, industries, and others employ stormwater controls to filter out pollutants and/or prevent pollution at its source. The benefits of effective stormwater runoff management can include:\n\nProtection of wetlands and aquatic ecosystems,\n\nImproved quality of coastal waters,\n\nConservation of water resources,\n\nProtection of public health, and\n\nFlood control.\n\nStormwater Management Plan\n\nThe objective of the City’s Stormwater Management Plan is to prohibit non-stormwater discharge and reduce the discharge of pollutants in an effort to limit adverse impact to our ocean and coastal region.\n\nThe City’s stormwater management plan aims to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Federal Clean Water Act and the California Waterboard’s State Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. These acts established pollution control programs and water quality criteria recommendations that are critical in our efforts to protect water quality.\n\nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)\n\nThe National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was created in 1972 as a part of the Clean Water Act. The program helps address water pollution by regulating storm drain points of entry that discharge pollutants to our waterways. The Regional Water Quality Board has issued the City of Long Beach, Order No. R4-2021-0105, which renews the municipal NDPES permit.\n\nStormwater Projects\n\nEl Dorado Regional Stormwater Capture Project\n\nLong Beach Municipal Urban Stormwater (LB-MUST) Project\n\nSkylinks Regional Stormwater Capture Project\n\nContact"
