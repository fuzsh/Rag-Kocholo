        "text": "The primary goal of an SWMP is to prevent pollution from entering waterways as a result of construction activity. Stormwater runoff can pick up a variety of pollutants, including sediment, oil and grease, chemicals, and debris.\n\nAn effective stormwater management plan will include measures to control erosion and sedimentation, as well as manage the storage and treatment of stormwater runoff.\n\nCommon Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are used to achieve these goals include:\n\nErosion and sedimentation control: silt fences, sediment basins, and erosion control matting\n\nStormwater storage: on-site detention basins\n\nStormwater treatment: oil/water separators, filter vaults, and infiltration trenches\n\nThe specific BMPs that will be used at a construction site will be based on the site’s particular characteristics. An experienced civil engineer can help determine the most appropriate stormwater management plan for your project.\n\nTherefore, it is important to have an effective stormwater management plan in place to protect our environment and ensure that our waterways are clean and safe.\n\nBenefits Of Having A Stormwater Management Plan.\n\nThere are many benefits of having a stormwater management plan in place. Some of the most important benefits include:\n\nPrevention Of Water Pollution\n\nStormwater management plans help to prevent water pollution by controlling the discharge of stormwater runoff.\n\nProtection Of Aquatic Habitats\n\nBy preventing water pollution, stormwater management plans also help to protect aquatic habitats.\n\nImprovement Of Water Quality\n\nStormwater management plans can help to improve water quality by reducing the amount of pollutants that enter our waterways.\n\nReduction In Flooding\n\nStormwater management plans can also help to reduce the risk of flooding by managing the storage and treatment of stormwater runoff.\n\nNeed a Stormwater Management Plan in New Jersey?\n\nCall 732-370-0291 or Contact Us Now.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is the best stormwater management program?\n\nA:The best stormwater management program is the one that is tailored to the specific needs of the community in which it is implemented.\n\nFactors that will influence what makes the best stormwater management program include the climate, geography, and topography of the area; the types of surfaces that make up the landscape; how much impervious surface there is; and the existing sewer infrastructure.\n\nQ: What are the minimum control measures for most stormwater programs?\n\nA: The basics of any stormwater program include reducing the amount of pollutants that enter stormwater runoff, and then treating stormwater runoff before it is discharged into receiving waters.\n\nQ: Are there pollutants carried in stormwater discharges?\n\nA: There are many pollutants that can be carried in stormwater discharges, including oils and grease, metals, pesticides, herbicides, and trash. These pollutants can contaminate waterways, causing environmental and public health concerns.\n\nQ: What are the pre development conditions for stormwater programs?\n\nA: A pre development condition for a stormwater management program is the existence of an effective water drainage system. The installation of an underground storm drainage system, combined with the use of retention and detention ponds, can help control flooding and improve water quality in urban areas.\n\nAdditional Resources"
