        "text": "In natural settings, falling rain and melting snow soak into the soil or make their way to streams and rivers. Eventually, all precipitation percolates into the groundwater supply or flows into the world’s oceans.\n\nIn urban settings, things go a little differently. All buildings have roofs, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other hard surfaces that prevent precipitation from absorbing easily into the ground. Instead, runoff is directed into gutters, ditches, and storm drains, where it eventually enters area waterways. All property owners in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC, are responsible for managing their stormwater facilities to help prevent flooding, erosion, and water pollution.\n\niSTORMWATER is proud to serve the DC Metro area with stormwater management services. Call (410) 231-3455 to get started.\n\nWhat Is Stormwater Management?\n\nStormwater management is the process of understanding, planning for, analyzing, and controlling stormwater runoff. Business owners are required to manage their stormwater systems for the common good of the entire community. After all, water runoff doesn’t follow subdivision or community boundaries.\n\nStormwater management systems are largely unseen and underappreciated by the general public. However, they are crucial for maintaining water quality and preventing flooding in urban settings. Stormwater facilities take many forms, some above ground and others below ground.\n\nExamples of aboveground facilities include:\n\nStormwater management ponds\n\nLow-impact developments\n\nBio-retention facilities\n\nSand filters\n\nInfiltration basins\n\nExtended detention facilities\n\nExamples of belowground facilities include:\n\nContech Engineered Solutions StormFilter\n\nHydro International Downstream Defender\n\nUnderground detention facilities\n\nAqua-Swirl Stormwater Treatment Systems\n\nBaySaver Technologies\n\nImbrium stormwater treatment products\n\nSchedule an appointment by calling (410) 231-3455 for stormwater management services in the DC metro area.\n\nThe Importance of Stormwater Management\n\nConsider the goals of stormwater management and how it helps the ecosystem:\n\nDecrease water pollution: Soil acts as a natural filter for rainwater, replenishing rivers and groundwater supplies with relatively clean water. This process is lacking in urban settings, where rainwater flows across hard surfaces before heading into storm drains. In this scenario, water carries debris, chemicals, bacteria, sediment, and other pollutants directly into streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands. That’s why one of the primary purposes of stormwater management is to detain stormwater and remove pollutants from it before reintroducing it to the local waterways.\n\nMitigate flooding and erosion: When excess water falls on impervious surfaces, it runs rapidly rather than soaking gradually into the earth. This can cause flooding, erosion, and infrastructure damage if not managed properly. With the correct stormwater facilities in place, runoff can be contained and controlled, preventing destructive floods and slowing soil erosion in the process.\n\nStop storm and sanitary sewer system overflow: Several types of stormwater facilities are designed to hold excess rainwater, but careful capacity calculations are needed to avoid overflow. The same goes for sanitary sewer systems. Stormwater runoff doesn’t pass through a treatment plant on its way to area waterways, but the sewer system itself could overflow if the proper stormwater management systems aren’t implemented and maintained correctly.\n\nMeet federal environmental regulations: Increasingly stringent federal regulations for water quality require local communities to buckle down on stormwater monitoring and control. If for no other reason, businesses should make stormwater management a priority to avoid fines and penalties.\n\nWhat Exactly Is Stormwater Runoff?\n\nStormwater runoff refers to the flow of rainwater and melted snow on impervious surfaces, such as parking lots, instead of being absorbed into the ground. As the water travels, it collects debris, pollutants, and other contaminants along the way. This runoff water eventually collects in drainage systems, slowly reaching local rivers, lakes, or oceans — and out of the cities.\n\nBecause not all city surfaces absorb rainwater and melted snow, it’s critical to implement stormwater management facilities to prevent a range of issues that can lead to:\n\nIncrease flooding: In cities, towns, and other places with plenty of pavement and concrete, stormwater runoff can create drainage issues when the system is overwhelmed. This can increase the chances of flooding because water can’t be directly absorbed into the ground.\n\nPollutant transport: With water traveling along impervious surfaces, it can pick up and transport oil, grease, pesticide, and other contaminants across spaces, negatively impacting water quality and local aquatic ecosystems.\n\nErosion: When soil is exposed in areas such as construction sites, the risk of soil erosion from stormwater runoff can increase, carrying soil into water bodies and leading to sedimentation.\n\nIn highly dense areas, it’s essential for business owners to effectively manage and control stormwater runoff to prevent pollution, flooding, and other critical environmental impacts, ensuring a safe society with optimal water quality.\n\nReady to learn more about the benefits of stormwater management in the DMV?
