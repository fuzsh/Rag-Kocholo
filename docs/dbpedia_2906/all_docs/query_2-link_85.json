        "text": "If you are interested in installing a dry well to help with drainage issues in your yard, the national average cost is $3,030, with prices typically ranging from $1,165 – $4,420. Dry well costs will correspond with the volume of water you are looking to collect and disperse into the surrounding soil.\n\nIt’s important to have good drainage systems in your yard to prevent soil erosion, foundation issues, and basement infiltration. Dry wells direct water away from problem areas such as downspouts and storm drains, collect it, and slowly disperse it into local groundwater.\n\nIn this cost guide:\n\nAverage costs\n\nCost estimator by volume\n\nOther factors that affect cost\n\nRelated services\n\nPro cost vs. DIY cost\n\nCost by location\n\nFAQ\n\nAverage dry well installation costs in 2024\n\nDry wells usually take one of three forms:\n\nA hand-dug hole filled with gravel, often referred to as a seepage pit\n\nA prefabricated plastic container\n\nA prefabricated or poured concrete container\n\nIf you’re looking to save money, hand-dug pits are the most cost-effective approach. The cost will only include the labor to dig the hole at $5 – $13 per linear foot and the cost of the gravel to fill the hole at $45 – $55 per yard.\n\nMore advanced installations involve prefabricated plastic containers and pipe and drain installations. These come in increments of 50 gallons and will still require the labor and materials to dig the appropriate-sized hole and line it with gravel. These are topped with drains or connected to pipes to route water into the vessel.\n\nThe final, most expensive installation involves installing concrete containers to manage runoff. Concrete dry wells are generally used for larger volumes of water and often involve machinery to dig, lift, and install. Expect a significant increase in cost if you choose this type of dry well.\n\nDry well installation cost estimator by volume\n\nOn average, each square foot of lawn requires 0.623 gallons of water per square foot each week. Rainwater in excess of this amount needs to be routed into proper drainage areas. A professional can review your property and determine the excess volume you will need to account for when installing your dry well.\n\nYou may want to plan your dry well installation in a manner that allows for expansion or installation of additional modules as needed. It’s okay to overestimate capacity. If installed correctly, dry wells will recirculate water into the water table even when they are not filled to capacity. Extra capacity will also provide additional protection for flash floods and heavy storms.\n\nSee below the typical costs of dry wells designed to capture different volumes of water.\n\nOther factors that affect cost\n\nDry well total costs vary based on a number of factors, including material, volume of water collected, and soil composition. When assessing possible cost, it may be beneficial to have a professional analyze your soil absorption rate and consider these additional factors.\n\nMaterials\n\nIn general, there are three types of dry wells:\n\nGravel-filled basins or seepage pits: Most affordable\n\nPrefabricated plastic basins: Moderate price\n\nConcrete basins: Most expensive\n\nEach costs progressively more to install, level, and maintain.\n\nSoil absorption rate\n\nDifferent soil compositions absorb water at different rates. In soils with slower absorption rates, you may need additional wells or seepage pits to hold water until the soil can properly absorb the captured volume.\n\nYou may wish to hire a consultant to perform a percolation test to determine your soil absorption rate. This will provide you with accurate data for pricing estimates. Percolation tests average around $900, with most ranging between $550 and $1,280.\n\nDetermining volume\n\nOne of the most important factors in ascertaining the cost of dry well installation is determining the volume of water you will need to capture and store.\n\nIt’s best to consult with an expert to determine the necessary volume of your well. They will include the soil absorption rate from your percolation test, lawn type, square footage, frequency/amount of irrigation, and average annual rainfall in their calculations.\n\nCost for this evaluation is typically included in the overall installation service, but you may see line items between $150 on the low end and $2,500 on the high end associated with this service.\n\nPermitting\n\nDepending on your location, you may be asked to pay a permit fee to install your dry well that averages from $25 to $50.\n\nMaintenance\n\nIt’s common for dry wells to become clogged and obstructed with debris from run-off. Catch basins and inlets are often installed to prevent clogging. Regular cleaning and upkeep of these basins is required to maintain optimal performance.\n\nHomeowners can clean and maintain dry wells themselves or hire a professional service to do it. Costs vary based on the significance of the obstructions but, generally, the required plumbing or landscaping labor costs $45 – $150 per hour.\n\nRelated services\n\nIndividuals interested in dry wells are often trying to manage distribution and absorption of water around their property. There are a host of related services that can support this effort. Some of the most common are listed below.\n\nFrench drains\n\nThe national average cost to install a French drain is $5,000, and typical projects run between $2,800 and $6,500.\n\nFrench drains consist of a trench lined with landscape fabric and porous PVC pipe, then surrounded with pea gravel. They route fluid to a designated area and disperse it into the soil.\n\nFrench drains are often considered an effective alternative to dry wells, aiding in the routing and absorption of excessive standing water across your lawn. Landscapers and homeowners tend to prefer French drains because they require less effort to install and less maintenance than dry wells.\n\nGutters\n\nTypically, the average homeowner will pay a range between $900 and $2,500 to have gutters installed on their home.\n\nThe surface area of your home’s roof collects and deposits water around your home, often distributing large amounts in less-than-ideal locations. Routing your roof run-off with a gutter, downspout, and storm drain system is a great way to manage water on your property.\n\nSprinkler systems\n\nOn average, sprinkler systems cost $3,150 to install, with the typical range for residential installations falling between $2,400 and $4,200.\n\nHow, where, and when you water your lawn factors into the placement and distribution of water collection systems like dry wells. To learn more about determining the best sprinkler system for your yard and water supply, see Choosing the Right Type of Sprinkler for Your Lawn.\n\nPond installation\n\nAnother common water management tool when landscaping is a pond. A pond not only collects excess water but also adds a visually pleasing water element to your landscape design. For the average homeowner, installing a pond costs around $4,000 and typically ranges from $1,900 to $6,500.\n\nGrading\n\nThe grade of your yard plays a large role in how water runoff is routed and collected throughout the property. Adjusting the grade of your land could aid your water management strategy.\n\nResidential grading services cost $1,700 on average, with the typical price range running from $770 to $3,000.\n\nPro cost vs. DIY cost\n\nBuilding a dry well by yourself is a viable option for many homeowners, especially when you do not have excessive water collection needs. In most cases, homeowners without heavy equipment should consider using either the seepage pit method or prefabricated plastic containers during dry well construction.\n\nTo begin this process, you should call 811 to determine where utility lines are located in your yard. Next, dig the appropriate-sized pit for your water collection needs, in an area where excess water is already being routed. Level the bottom of the pit using pea gravel or another porous media. Pea gravel costs $0.86 to $3.78 per square foot, on average.\n\nIf you’re using the seepage pit method and no container, you should layer gravel up to ground level. The porous nature of the gravel will allow water to flow into the pit, collect, and disperse into the soil strata.\n\nIf you are utilizing a plastic container, be sure to add enough gravel into the hole so the top of your collection container is level with the ground. Once level, you can add gravel surrounding your container and install the drain even with the lawn.\n\nShould you install a dry well by yourself?\n\nDigging a pit for a dry well requires a lot of elbow grease. If you don’t have the physical strength and endurance to complete the job, hiring a pro might be worth it.\n\nFor those willing to put in the work, a dry well is a completely doable task for small-volume collection needs. If you have excessive run-off, you should consult an expert before attempting to install a large, costly system.\n\nCost of dry well installation by location\n\nA host of regional factors can affect dry well installation cost. Soil absorption rates and consistency, which differ greatly by location, are primary factors in determining whether a dry well can be installed or is even needed.\n\nThe types of ground cover you are able to grow and the necessary irrigation required in different areas also play a big part. A local contractor can help you choose the best dry well system for your property and give you a more accurate estimate for your region.\n\nFAQ\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDry wells are a great home improvement project to manage water, resolve drainage problems, and keep groundwater healthy. Homeowners should pay attention to materials, soil absorption rate, desired volume, local permitting policy, and maintenance when creating a budget for a dry well.\n\nThe average homeowner will pay around $3,030 to have a dry well installed, and there are a number of factors that should be considered. It’s always a good idea to consult a local expert before planning your project, even if you’re going for a DIY installation.\n\nNote: Lawn Love may get a referral fee for matching you with contractors in your area."
