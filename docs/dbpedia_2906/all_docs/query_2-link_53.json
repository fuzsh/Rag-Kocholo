        "text": "While digging in a neglected bed on my property, I uncovered what appears to be an old dry well. It's about 4 feet deep, and 2 feet around, and the lid has rusted away. I nearly fell into it. It is empty, with gravel at the bottom, and a 3 inch clay pipe entering it from the nearby property line. The walls are corrugated steel, with some holes made in spots around them.\n\nThe clay pipe is open as far as I can probe. The well seems preserved, except for the lid, but can't tell how long ago any water was actually in it. It is dry now but there's been no rain for a week or more.\n\nMy first thought was to fill it with gravel, so no one could ever fall into it, lid or not, but then it seemed to me that whoever designed it wanted it to be empty, I assume to handle more water.\n\nWould it be best just to cover it with a lid, and replace the soil, or would it make sense to leave some sort of access to it? I believe modern codes would require some sort of marking, and inspection lid, though that only makes sense I guess, especially if it still needs to be functional.\n\nAnyone else ever dealt with this?\n\nSince the well is clean, surface water must not be involved. That generally carries debris. If it seems of no use, filling it with gravel is a reversible choice. You could remove the gravel in the future if necessary.\n\nDefinitely find a lid. I had to fix a septic tank lid last year. Just bought two bags of crete mix and found a simple form. Threw in a little scrap steel since it was in the VFW parking lot and placed the concrete. My form was an old plastic tub that happened to be the correct diameter for a tight fit. You can make a square lid and not use steel. I covered the fresh concrete with water and let it cure two weeks before moving it. If you do the same, the tensile strength will be approximately 400 psi. That should should support garden traffic. If you have any old steel, throw it in the bottom of the form for a little more tensile strength.\n\nIn our state, only wells that have the potential to contaminate drinking water aquifers must be treated in any special way. No jurisdiction I can think of would regulate a four foot deep void on private property providing it is covered and safe.\n\nBefore you do anything, check for buried treasure :exclaim:"
