        "text": "NEWS RELEASE\n\nFRONT RANGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n*************************\n\nFront Range Community College has been selected from a competitive pool of applicants to receive $100,000 to transform the futures of students in our communities. The funding comes from Metallica’s foundation, All Within My Hands (AWMH), which is making a multimillion-dollar investment in critical workforce programs at community colleges nationwide.\n\n“These funds will help our students pay for—and succeed in—several of FRCC’s critical career-technical education programs,” says President Colleen Simpson, EdD. “With this support from All Within My Hands, we’ll be able to give our Metallica Scholars the support they need to get into the Colorado workforce in high-paying, high-tech jobs.”\n\nPrecision Machining\n\nOptics Technology\n\nWelding Technology\n\nAutomation & Engineering Technology\n\nElectronics Engineering Technology\n\nFRCC plans to use the MSI funding to support students in all of the programs at the college’s high-tech Center for Integrated Manufacturing in Longmont. Students in the welding program at FRCC’s campus in Fort Collins will also be eligible to apply for scholarships.\n\nSupporting Workforce Education\n\n“The Metallica Scholars Initiative is so important to us because we are seeing results. Five years in, with the help of community colleges across the country, we are helping people fill these essential jobs which require skills and training. We are so proud and grateful that we can facilitate this program,” said Lars Ulrich, Metallica.\n\nThe Metallica Scholars Initiative (MSI) was launched in 2019 by the band’s foundation, in partnership with the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC). The major workforce education initiative is entering its fifth year with the addition of 11 new colleges, and an ambitious expansion into new programs.\n\nMSI now directly supports 42 community colleges across 33 states, and by the end of this year, it will have helped more than 6,000 students to pursue careers in the trades. To date, Metallica and AWMH have invested more $6 million in the American workforce.\n\nReaffirming a commitment to career and technical education at the local level, each new school brings incredible opportunities to a thriving and growing community, according to AWMH Executive Director Peter Delgrosso.\n\n“The Metallica Scholars Initiative is a strong and cooperative assemblage of the nation’s best community colleges, creating a supportive climate for participants to communicate directly and share best practices,” Delgrosso says. “As a result, our Metallica Scholars leave the program well-trained and confident. Ultimately, the impact is felt locally and nationally as Metallica Scholars enter the workforce and fill in-demand technical positions.”\n\nJoining the Mission\n\nFRCC is joining 41 other schools across the US that the foundation supports. “We are happy to continue to partner with Metallica’s All Within My Hands Foundation to support the vital career and technical education work of the nation’s community colleges,” said Walter G. Bumphus, AACC’s president and CEO.\n\n“Colleges across the country provide pathways to well-paying jobs through programs, services and training that lead to in-demand skills, certificates and degrees for students,” he adds. “These programs are responsive to the needs of local businesses and provide a pipeline of qualified workers to local industry. Partners like Metallica that continue to provide support for community colleges help us to showcase the importance of investing in the transformative power of community college education.”\n\nExpanding Our Reach\n\nThe 11 newly added colleges are joining a roster of 31 veteran schools invited to continue in the program. Each year, the returning colleges play an integral part in helping guide the success of the new schools.\n\nSee the full list of schools supported by the Metallica Scholars Program.\n\nWhat began with 10 colleges and mostly manufacturing programs has developed into a diverse offering of workforce opportunities for students interested in gaining the skills and training necessary to find meaningful and well-paying careers in fields and positions including:\n\nAgriculture\n\nAutomation and Robotics\n\nAutomotive Technology\n\nAviation, Computer-Aided Drafting & Design\n\nCarpentry\n\nComputerized Manufacturing (CNC)\n\nConstruction Technology\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nCulinary Arts\n\nCybersecurity\n\nDiesel Technology\n\nDental Hygiene\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nEMT\n\nFire Technology\n\nHealthcare\n\nHeating & Ventilation (HVAC)\n\nHeavy Equipment Operator\n\nHospitality\n\nIndustrial Maintenance Technology\n\nLineworker\n\nManufacturing & Machining\n\nMechanical Design\n\nMechatronics Engineering\n\nProcess Technology\n\nTrucking (CDL)\n\nWelding\n\nWind Energy\n\nAbout The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC)\n\nAs the voice of the nation’s community colleges, the American Association of Community Colleges leads, advocates, and advances the nation’s community colleges.

It also allows Metallica’s fans to engage in philanthropy and volunteerism. The Foundation is dedicated to creating sustainable communities through workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services.
