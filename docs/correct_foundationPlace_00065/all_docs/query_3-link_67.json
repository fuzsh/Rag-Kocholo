I’ve got family members who are into working on fast muscle cars, and this is where I want to be.\n\nJon Osborn\n\nOverlay for card in mobile\n\nLiberal Arts & Transfer\n\nThe Ticket to Transfer\n\nAssociate of Arts\n\nIf you want to save money AND take advantage of small class sizes, SCTCC is the best place to start your bachelor's degree. Not only do we offer an AA, but you have Transfer Pathway options to customize your transfer.\n\nI'm getting an AA, and I know classes are transferable. Plus they're much cheaper on this side. You can take an identical course for half the price and it's the same class. The small classes are outstanding: you get a lot more one-on-one.\n\nAdric Waibel\n\nOverlay for card in mobile\n\nCulinary Arts\n\nCurated Cuisine\n\nAssociate of Applied Science\n\nDiploma\n\nTake your passion for food to the next level with a degree from SCTCC's Culinary Arts program. With food presentation, nutrition, sanitation, and safe equipment operation, Culinary Arts will let you have fun in the kitchen for success in your career.\n\nI took the tour of the Culinary program and met Chef Jay. He made the program sound super fun with all the things we get to do, and I thought to myself, this is it. This is the college I want to go to.\n\nAlyssa Leopold\n\nOverlay for card in mobile\n\nParamedicine\n\nHighlighting Health Care\n\nAssociate of Applied Science\n\nWith a fast-paced career like Paramedicine, SCTCC grads get ready to save lives by training in simulations that have real-life application.\n\nThe health field seemed like a lot of fun—helping people in need. I wasn’t sure where I fit in, but then I took the EMR class in high school, and bingo. There it was.\n\nSainab Gaal\n\nOverlay for card in mobile\n\nEducation Within Your Reach"
