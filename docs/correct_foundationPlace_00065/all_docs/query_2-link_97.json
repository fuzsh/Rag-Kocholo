        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS – Trisco Foods, a food manufacturer and contract packager, announced Tuesday the Australian-based company will establish its U.S. headquarters and first production facility in Colorado Springs.\n\n“Colorado Springs is an exciting and fast-growing region and mirrors the balanced but hard-working lifestyle of our hometown in Brisbane, Australia. We believe that food brings families together, and we have been warmly welcomed to the Front Range family in Colorado,” Mike Tristram, CEO of Trisco Foods, said.\n\nThe company will expand its capabilities and product portfolio in two phases.\n\nPhase I has already started, with Trisco Foods finalizing the purchases of a facility located off West Garden of the Gods Rd. and Centennial Blvd. near the Citizen’s Service Center. The facility will open in mid-2019.\n\nThe company will construct a world-class food manufacturing operation at the site.\n\nTrisco Foods is a family-owned food and beverage manufacturer since 1875, making food syrups that assist patients who have a difficult time swallowing.\n\nPhase II will happen over the next five years and could create over 50 jobs. Trisco will use its extensive capabilities and 130-plus years of experience to help introduce unique and innovative food solutions into new markets, locally and across the globe.\n\n“We’re excited about the confidence Trisco has placed in our region and we look forward to celebrating their success with them for years to come,” Dick Draper, president and CEO, Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC, said.\n\nTrisco chose Colorado Springs as the best place for its U.S. headquarter for lots of reasons.\n\n“In particular, Colorado Springs has an active, outdoor and healthy lifestyle that is analogous to the work-life balance Trisco strives to promote,” Alex Travnicek, Trisco’s Project Manager, said.\n\nThe company’s global headquarters will stay in Australia, however, the Colorado Springs facility will be used not only to serve the current domestic market but also have the capability to supply potential new export markets in Europe and South America in the near future.\n\nCurrently, patients have to wait about six weeks for the product to be manufactured in Australia and shipped to the U.S.\n\nTrisco believes a facility in America would reduce wait times and enhance product delivery to patients.\n\nThe company’s investment plans predict a $7,000,000 capital investment with over 50 new jobs created over four years. The pitch to the city estimates an average wage of $57,584 for workers. The median household income in El Paso County was $62,535 in 2017 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThrough an economic development agreement, the state of Colorado provided Trisco Foods with job growth incentive tax credits in hopes of supporting an international business opportunity in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe total costs for the city are estimated at $32,000, with $16,000 going toward machinery and equipment and the other $16,000 for construction materials.\n\nThe community benefits, or overall economic impact over a span of four years, would be $42,000,000 with the net city revenue from the expansion totaling around $542,000.\n\nTrisco Foods has hired a professional employer organization looking to hire mostly locals to fill the new positions.\n\nSome city council members had previously voiced their concerns over potential noise problems.\n\nTrisco Foods said they are a low industrial manufacturing company. The machinery for the facility does not require any ear protection for workers and they run very quietly. The company does not expect to use generators for the renovations but if they do, it will be low noise generators.\n\nThe agreement proposed to city council members is in line with the City Council Strategic Plan to promote job creation, stimulate economic development and enhance the city’s appeal to high-technology and manufacturing businesses."
