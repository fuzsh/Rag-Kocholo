        "text": "El Paso County lies in east central Colorado and encompasses more than 2,158 square miles. As the most populous county in Colorado, El Paso County has just as many stories to tell as people to tell them. This podcast will endeavor to share those stories.\n\nFrom local government officials to leaders in the community, Beyond the Dais will step off the elevated platform of the Chamber and shine a spotlight on the people working to make El Paso County a great place to visit, work, and live.\n\nOn May 10, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury launched the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Program authorized pursuant to the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”). ARPA is bringing one-time funding to our State and County that will assist in the recovery of our region.\n\nThe State of Colorado received $3.8 billion, and El Paso County received $139,929,837 based on the County’s population. Learn more about El Paso County’s ARPA Funding.\n\nThe Courier is a monthly publication that is circulated physically and virtually to the residents in our community, informing them of County services, values, events, and stories.\n\nThe Courier makes it so that every resident of El Paso County can better understand which government services the county offers and how they can benefit from and be involved in local government initiatives.\n\nThis not only helps our residents to better grasp where their tax dollars are spent and how local government works, but it also highlights collaborations and partnerships, informing residents of what is going on in the region.\n\nPursuant to Colorado law, the Board of County Commissioners must adopt the annual balanced budget by December of each year, by starting the process in October.\n\nEl Paso County Elected Officials and County Departments present budget requests and critical needs to the Board of County Commissioners during the annual budget process."
