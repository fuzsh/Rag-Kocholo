        "text": "Credit Union of Colorado, founded in 1934, has occupied its current headquarters in downtown Denver for more than 56 years. When we started construction on the Logan Street headquarters in 1962, it was state-of-the-art, mid-century modern. We are excited to have a 21st-century headquarters in 2023, that will serve the credit union for the next 50 years. Originally known as the Colorado State Employees Credit Union and serving only active state employees, the credit union has changed and grown throughout the years and is now one of the largest credit unions in the state, serving members from all walks of life throughout the Denver metropolitan area and along the Front Range. While its headquarters is moving, Credit Union of Colorado will continue to operate a full-service branch in the downtown area. The new Downtown Denver branch will be located on the corner of Tremont Street and Colfax Avenue and will feature a drive-through window for downtown commuters. The new downtown branch is expected to open in September of 2023.\n\nThe new headquarters will attract talented individuals to support our Colorado-based contact center and lending department so we can continue to deliver exceptional service to our members. It will be energy efficient and follow best practices in environmental construction. Additionally, office spaces will be designed to support new work styles of our staff. We plan for more collaborative and flexible workspaces that support hybrid workstyles and teamwork. The building grounds will include green space, a walking path, and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nFebruary 1, 2023\n\nCredit Union of Colorado names new president ahead of new HQ opening\n\nEzeRoad.com\n\nApril 26, 2022\n\nCredit Union of Colorado’s New HQ to Feature Smart Windows\n\nMile High CRE\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nHeadquarters for up to 500 employees planned for Denver’s Central Park\n\nCentral Park Scoop\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\nCredit Union of Colorado Building New Three-Story Headquarters\n\nDenver Business Journal\n\nNovember 1, 2021\n\nUpcoming Development in Central Park\n\nFront Porch"
