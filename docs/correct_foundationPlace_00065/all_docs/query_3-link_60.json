        "text": "CCCS and 13 Member Colleges Receive Funding for Scholarships and Student Supports\n\nMay 7, 2024 (Denver, CO) – The Colorado Community College System (CCCS) and its thirteen member colleges have received almost $3.9 million from the Colorado Opportunity Scholarship Initiative (COSI), a state program that works to reduce barriers to higher education and workforce training.\n\nThe Foundation for Colorado Community Colleges received nearly $600,000 through COSI’s Matching Student Scholarship program, which will provide funding to all 13 CCCS colleges as matching challenge incentives for scholarships. In addition, the Foundation received $70,000 through the Career Launch program that furnishes scholarships for students pursuing in-demand credentials.\n\n“We are grateful to receive these generous grants from COSI to continue powering our scholarship program,” said J. Adam Cermak, Chief Development Officer and Executive Director of the Foundation for Colorado Community Colleges. “These funds will allow us to keep college in reach for hundreds of community colleges students while moving the needle on credential completion.”\n\nSeveral colleges earned Community Partner Program Grants, which aim to improve enrollment and retention in public postsecondary institutions. CCCS colleges will collaborate with local high schools to boost college-going rates through 2026.\n\n“The funding from this grant is crucial to the success of our students, as it provides critical wraparound services such as coaching and advising,” said Donna Nelson, the Chief Development Officer for the Pikes Peak State College Foundation. “We know that providing scholarships for tuition is only one part of the solution to increase the number of higher education graduates in the Pikes Peak region. The CPP Grants help to close the gaps even more.”\n\nRead the full list of grantees below:\n\nCounty-Based Awards Grantee Amount Arapahoe Community College Foundation on behalf of Arapahoe County $771,656 Front Range Community College on behalf of Larimer County $210,559 Lamar Community College Foundation on behalf of Baca, Bent, Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Prowers Counties $38,648 Morgan Community College Foundation on behalf of Elbert, Kit Carson, Lincoln, Morgan, Washington, and Yuma Counties $87,503 Northeastern Junior College Foundation on behalf of Logan, Phillips, and Sedgwick Counties $32,812 Otero Junior College Foundation on behalf of Crowley and Otero Counties $36,928 Pikes Peak State College on behalf of Teller County $9,154 Red Rocks Community College Foundation on behalf of Jefferson County $392,662 Institutions of Higher Education Awards Grantee Amount Foundation for Colorado Community Colleges $590,467 Community Partner Program Grants – Postsecondary Grantee Amount Community College of Aurora $150,000 Front Range Community College $200,000 Lamar Community College Foundation 80,000 Morgan Community College Foundation $80,000 Northeastern Junior College $80,000 Pikes Peak Community College Foundation $342,000 Pueblo Community College $200,000 Red Rocks Community College Foundation $150,000 Community Partner Program Grants – Pre-Collegiate Grantee Amount Lamar Community College Foundation $100,000 Morgan Community College Foundation $100,000 Northeastern Junior College $100,000 Career Launch Grants Grantee Amount Arapahoe Community College Foundation $75,000 Foundation for Colorado Community Colleges $70,000 Northeastern Junior College Foundation $30,000\n\n###\n\nAbout the Foundation for Colorado Community Colleges\n\nFounded in 1987, the Foundation for Colorado Community Colleges advances the mission, vision, goals, and objectives of the Colorado Community College System.
