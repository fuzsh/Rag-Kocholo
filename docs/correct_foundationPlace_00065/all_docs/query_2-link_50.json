Since 2004, we have helped over 500,000 service members and their families access resources from our partner network and have distributed over $6 million in direct financial aid to lend a hand to help you through the most challenging of times. Our programs are designed to help you and your family access the resources you need to thrive and survive. Our mission is to give you the help you need to focus on your mission – and stay on the path to success.\n\nWe have seen how much stronger we can all be when part of something bigger. Whether that’s a platoon, squadron, fleet, or simply a team – when we work together we all succeed. That commitment to collaboration is what sets HFMN apart from other organizations. We leverage the power of a network of dedicated partner agencies that understand Military and veteran culture to better assist service members, veterans, and their families."
