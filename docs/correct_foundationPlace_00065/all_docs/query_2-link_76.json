And sometimes, it could be as simple as a tripped breaker or as complicated as a damaged internal component. Either way, our experienced specialists are ready to tackle the problems head-on.\n\nInaccurate Thermostat Setting - One of the easiest ways to fix temperature issues is to check that your thermostat has the correct setting for your needs. Kids or guests in your home could be knowingly/unknowingly adjusting your thermostat. The ideal refrigerator temperature is 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Anything higher could cause food to freeze. If everything looks good and you're still experiencing problems, reach out to our team for help.\n\nVents are Blocked - Improper ventilation internally or externally can cause temperature inaccuracies. Refrigerators should have at least a quarter-inch clearance from the wall, and food containers should never block internal vents. We recommend cleaning out your fridge at least once a month to ensure adequate air circulation.\n\nDamaged Control Board - Most modern refrigerators use a main control circuit board and temperature control board. When either malfunctions or is damaged, it could be the primary culprit in temperature issues. While this may seem like an easy fix, it can be difficult for someone inexperienced to diagnose, which is why a professional should be called to take care of it.\n\nNowadays, some refrigerators have so many bells and whistles that they can rival smartphones! While refrigerators help elevate the visual appeal of your kitchen, they are also safe food storage options that prevent harmful bacteria from growing on perishable items. We know you can't afford to go even a day without your fridge, which is why Mr. Appliance of the Front Range offers refrigerator repair services for Colorado Springs families.\n\nCall us or schedule service online for Falcon appliance repair near you today!\n\nDo Refrigerators Usually Make Noise?\n\nRefrigerators do make noise when they're working normally. As long as the various sounds it's making (buzzing, popping, creaking, etc.) aren't too loud, it should be normal. But if you hear a different sound than you normally would or just a loud sound from it, it may be a good idea to keep an eye on it.
