        "text": "Boulder Public Library again will be partnering with Tax Help Colorado and Mile High United Way to provide FREE, high-quality tax preparation to households that earned less than $64,000 in 2023. See if you qualify.\n\nWe will keep this page updated for other tax assistance in 2024 once we get more information: Boulder Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, VITA, was closed for 2023 and may be for 2024 as well. At this time, there are no VITA tax assistance locations anywhere near the Boulder area but that could change. Other area VITA and TCE/AARP programs can be found by visiting Colorado VITA for more information and resources."
