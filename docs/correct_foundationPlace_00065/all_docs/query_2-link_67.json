        "text": "Nationally, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the principal federal agency responsible for administering the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Colorado Ecological Services Field Offices carry out those ESA responsibilities for Colorado. Using the best available science, our Ecological Services personnel work with federal, state, Tribal, local, and non-profit stakeholders, as well as private landowners, to avoid, minimize, and mitigate threats to vulnerable species and habitat. We also conduct oil spill and other environmental contaminant assessment and response activities, promote management and habitat restoration actions, and coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure fish and wildlife impacts are considered during the planning and construction of projects.\n\nThe field office in Lakewood serves the Front Range and eastern Colorado, and the field office in Grand Junction serves the West Slope and western Colorado. Please see the map below for each officeâ€™s jurisdiction. While each office serves a different geographic area, the field offices work together for conservation of vulnerable species and habitat across the state.\n\nThe conservation of Colorado's most imperiled species is at the heart of our offices' work. We administer the Endangered Species Act by evaluating the impact of various land and water development projects on Colorado's vulnerable species and habitats, by working to recover listed species, and by facilitating alternative ways to conserve species and habitat in addition to potential listing under the ESA. All of our work is done in conjunction with partners, including state and federal agencies, local governments, conservation entities, and with the Tribal and private landowners of Colorado."
