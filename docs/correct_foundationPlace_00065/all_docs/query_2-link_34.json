They provide access to markets and customers, which is essential to their growth. Similarly, they also contribute to the overall quality of life for citizens.\n\nThe state’s roads are funded by local, state and federal governments through taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel and other products. Additionally, a large portion of road funding is provided by federal highway user fees.\n\nDiscover more\n\nAccessibility and Connectivity\n\nColorado Springs is home to a thriving economy and a growing population that requires a robust network of roads, highways and bridges to facilitate mobility for residents and businesses. This includes access to work, school, shopping, and social events as well as travel for recreation, tourism and transportation of goods.\n\nIn addition to the state’s two major highways that connect Denver and Colorado Springs, there are several additional roadways that link both cities to each other as well as to surrounding communities. These roadways provide direct access to the region’s most important commercial, industrial, educational and recreational destinations, and they help promote the state’s unique natural beauty and scenic views.\n\nInterstate 25 runs conveniently through the city of Colorado Springs and intersects with Interstate 70 for broad east-west access. It is one of the most traveled routes in Colorado and provides a quick and easy commute to both Colorado Springs and Denver International Airports.\n\nThe I-25 gap project added express lanes in each direction, widened shoulders, and rebuilt five bridges to improve travel through this section of the highway. It also created four new wildlife crossings for improved safety.\n\nEconomic Development\n\nColorado Springs residents have access to a wide variety of ways to get around the city. While a majority of people commute to work in their own vehicles, carpooling is a popular alternative. This can help reduce traffic congestion and improve overall travel times.\n\nThe city of Colorado Springs has a number of transportation-related projects underway, including a study of how to extend Constitution Boulevard across town. Neighbors raised concerns about noise, traffic and pollution from the high-speed road that would cross through a historic neighborhood.\n\nOther road and transit improvements include a planned replacement of a Union Pacific Railroad bridge, an expansion of Marksheffel Road to add lanes and safety features and the creation of an express bus service for downtown employees. A portion of a 1% sales tax approved in 2014 will continue to fund these projects.\n\nAs a state, we must ensure that our transportation infrastructure is capable of supporting the needs of Colorado’s growing population and businesses. This means that we must make investments in the transportation system that will support Colorado’s economic development, health and quality of life.\n\nSafety\n\nThe quality, safety and reliability of Colorado’s roads, highways and bridges are essential to the state’s economy. About 1.1 million full-time jobs in key industries like tourism, retail sales, agriculture and manufacturing depend on efficient and reliable transportation infrastructure.\n\nTraffic congestion is a major cause of vehicle travel delays and reduces productivity. The TRIP report “Keeping Colorado Mobile” estimates that congestion costs drivers $3.5 billion each year in the form of lost time and wasted fuel.\n\nIn Colorado, nearly half of the state’s major locally and state-maintained roads are in poor or mediocre condition. In addition, five percent of locally and state-maintained bridges (20 feet or more in length) are rated poor/structurally deficient.\n\nThese conditions cost motorists additional operating costs, including accelerated vehicle depreciation, increased repair costs and increased fuel consumption and tire wear. In addition, the TRIP report estimates that road conditions contribute to traffic fatalities in Colorado.\n\nDrivers also use their vehicles to transport freight, which increases the demand for freight transportation facilities that have the capacity to accommodate the volume of freight being carried. The number of freight routes in Colorado that are constrained because they do not have adequate load carrying capacity to accommodate the volume of trucks entering and exiting them is significant.\n\nLife Cycle\n\nWhen it comes to traveling between Denver and Colorado Springs, a variety of transportation options are available. Depending on your preference, you can drive yourself on a number of routes, take a bus or even fly from Denver to Colorado Springs.\n\nMost people who want to travel between Denver and Colorado Springs head straight down I-25, which is the most direct way to get from one city to the other. However, if you’re looking for something a little less direct and a bit more scenic, there’s also CO-67, which will take you across the mountains and add an hour or so to your trip.\n\nDespite that extra time, CO-67 is a great option to see some of the most stunning front range views in the state. It’s also a good idea to take the time to explore the small towns and villages along the way, like Sedalia, Palmer Lake or Monument.\n\nAnother popular alternative is to take the Bustang, a purple shuttle that departs from Denver’s Union Station multiple times daily and costs $13 a ride. This is a quick and easy way to get from one city to the other and it’s perfect for those who don’t have their own vehicle."
