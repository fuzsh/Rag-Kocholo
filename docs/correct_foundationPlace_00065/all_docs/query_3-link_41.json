        "text": "Established in 1993, the Denver HBF was founded under the premise of creating accessible living spaces for less fortunate individuals. Through the use of volunteer labor and donated materials, the philanthropic, not-for-profit arm of the Denver HBA rallies resources to provide life changing modifications to homes such as building wheel chair ramps, complete bathroom remodels, widening doorways and changing floor surfaces to accommodate individuals in wheelchairs.\n\nSince its inception, Alpine Lumber has partnered with the Home Builders Foundation in support of their mission. Our Employee Owner leaders have served diligently on the HBF Board of Directors, as Gifting Committee members, and on volunteer teams. Through the Foundation, Alpine Lumber generously shares back to the Front Range community by donating building materials and forming volunteer groups to adopt projects on a regular basis. We stand united with the HBF to continually grow and strengthen our humanitarian ties to a community segment that is often overlooked."
