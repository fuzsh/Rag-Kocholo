        "text": "This study describes various types of foundation designs to be considered for structural engineering projects when the subsoil foundation consists of expansive or swelling soils. Among civil and architectural engineers expansive soils are known to be difficult foundation materials and problematic. These type of soils swell when they are subjected to moistures and shrink due to moisture loss. Because of this different behaviour upon wetting and drying, they cause minor to major structural damages to pavements as well as buildings. Every year millions of dollars spent dealing with the consequences of swelling soils. For design of foundations on swelling soil, it is first essential to recognize and evaluate the soil based on its swelling potential, and then determining the most proper foundation design that can be constructed on this problematic soil. In general, this study presents some of the most common techniques to evaluate the swelling potential of expansive soils. Also, it discu..."
