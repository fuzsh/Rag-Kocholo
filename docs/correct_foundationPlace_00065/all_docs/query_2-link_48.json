For Tanner Scholvin, a 27-year-old CU Boulder second-year student, making the transition from military to university was a new experience.\n\nAfter serving two tours in Afghanistan, one from Coloradoâ€™s Fort Carson near Colorado Springs and the other from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Tanner decided to officially call Colorado his home and CU Boulder his university. Throughout his tour of duty, Tanner knew his goal was to eventually attend college and study computer science, and with years of eye-opening life experience, he was ready for a new chapter."
