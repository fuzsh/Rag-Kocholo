        "text": "For every $10 of sales tax collected in Colorado Springs, one cent goes towards TOPS. Despite the clear economic and social benefits that come from our trails, open spaces, and parks, Colorado Springs has one of the lowest TOPS taxes in the Front Range region, bringing in only $9 million in revenue per year.\n\nThe Trails and Open Space Coalition (TOSC) is spearheading the campaign to make sure that TOPS is renewed by voters in Colorado Springs. Our city’s parks are so loved and valued, and TOSC is encouraging voters to continue the TOPS Program until 2043.\n\nOur outdoor spaces are important. We are asking residents to consider “without raising taxes” to extend the TOPS program for 20 more years (which will cost the average household $14 per year). . Issue 1 will be on the ballot in April 2023. We hope you will stand with us and vote to support funding for new trails, more acres of open spaces, and improving parks. We hope you will stand with us and vote to support funding for new trails, more acres of open spaces, and improving parks.\n\nWithout TOPS, some of our community’s best parks, favorite trails, and pristine open spaces would not exist. Stratton Open Space was one of the first properties to be preserved, followed by Blodgett and Red Rock Canyon Open Space. All three were targets for local development.\n\nThe commercial vision for Red Rock Canyon was a private golf course with high rise hotels and luxury townhouses. Instead, the City used TOPS money to purchase the 789 acres of land and preserved it as a recreational open space.\n\nTOPS has had a significant impact on our community – thousands of acres of open space, dozens of parks, miles of trails – it’s hard to imagine life in Colorado Springs without the amazing outdoor amenities TOPS has helped to create and protect."
