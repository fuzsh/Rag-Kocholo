        "text": "The future of water supply in Castle Rock, Colorado, a rapidly expanding Rocky Mountain Front Range city\n\nWhat is the future of the water supply in Castle Rock, Colorado? How are officials and residents in this Colorado Front Range town responding to the growing water demands and a changing climate? What are their plans for a sustainable future? Does the plan consider equally all segments of the town’s population?\n\nThis summer, two Rockies summer interns documented the spatiotemporal changes the town of Castle Rock has undergone since 1937. A GIS analysis demonstrates significant changes in land use cover as expected with population increase. To provide an accurate historical account, the interns worked closely with the county’s archivist to help tell the story of the town's evolution and its ongoing water crisis.\n\nThe students interviewed Castle Rock, Douglas County, and state officials about the town’s current conservation programs and plans for the future. We looked for broader implications in our findings by asking whether the sustainability approach implemented by the town of Castle Rock could serve as a model for other cities in geographically semi-arid environments.\n\nWe are sharing our research findings and implications with Castle Rock town officials, Douglas County Library, conservation advocacy groups, economists, the campus community, and others by featuring this work in State of the Rockies publications, web posts, social media platforms, and other campus communications venues and media.\n\n— Cyndy Hines, State of the Rockies Project Specialist\n\nMy name is Diellza, and I am an Economics Major from Kosovo. I am particularly interested in the economics and management of water. Colorado College has proven to be a great place to pursue my interests as it stands on land with significant water challenges. Two summers ago, I had the opportunity to work on a literature review that examined the economic impacts of water demand management in the Upper Basin. This summer, I worked with the State of the Rockies where I looked at what Castle Rock has done to manage water scarcities and the behavioral economics of communicating water rates. My senior thesis is also focused on water issues, except this time I am looking at Kosovo rather than the American southwest. It is exciting to learn more about what challenges my country faces in that area, and how I can produce something useful for my thesis project."
