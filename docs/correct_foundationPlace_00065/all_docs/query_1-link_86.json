        "text": "“I chose the CSB for its legacy as a strong rooted LIC with preceptors who care so much about their learners. Because it has been around for nearly a decade, the relationships the program has with community and academic preceptors in Colorado Springs are trustworthy and refined.”\n\n- Matt Genelin, CSB Class of 2023\n\n“I chose the CSB because I am familiar with Southern Colorado and grew up in Southern Colorado and wanted to be there. But I also chose the CSB because I thought we would get better in-depth clinical experience with one more time to work with attendings 1:1.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I chose the CSB after talking with other CSB students from prior classes. I wanted that smaller learning community that comes with a branch campus. And I was drawn to a setting where there weren’t many residents: that ability to have so much 1:1 time with attendings is hard to find at really most medical schools, and I felt it would help me learn as much as I could during the LIC.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“For me, I heard that in the CSB you got a lot of 1:1 time with attendings, and I really wanted to have that hands-on experience. A big question for me was whether I wanted to do a surgical specialty or a medical specialty, and I suspected that hands-on experience would help me make that decision faster.”\n\n- Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I was the first assist on so many surgeries! That was definitely the highlight. And there were so many impactful relationships with patients. The ability to follow patients longitudinally and cultivate relationships with them was very meaningful. Those special moments of building trust not only with my preceptors but with my patients were the best memories of the year.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“One of my favorite things was how much I got to choose my own schedule, and how accommodating the leadership team was in helping me create that individualization. I was able to explore outside of the core specialties. Those subspecialty experiences really pushed me to learn deeply; I was given the opportunities to make mistakes and to fail, and that’s where I learned. And the teachers in the subspecialties who volunteer to teach are so excited to have you and teach you!”\n\n- Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“The two best parts of the CSB was getting to see my best friends/classmates at least once a week at our weekly Learning Seminar to talk about our experiences and growth. And also there was a moment in the Winter/Spring where patients began to recognize you as their “provider” and the benefit of the longitudinal curriculum really became apparent — how cool to be called someone’s Doctor so early!”\n\n- Matt Genelin, CSB Class of 2023\n\n“The highlights. . .be able to work so closely with attendings was a highlight. There are very few residents or fellows working out of the hospitals in Colorado Springs. So being so involved in procedures quickly as a LIC student was rewarding. And getting to have an early sense of ownership of your patients because it really boiled down to you and the attending taking care of them.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“Orthopedics! Being at the CSB was the single most impactful thing that I have done for my learning. I am so much more comfortable and capable in the operating room because of my experience in the CSB. When I go on away rotations, attendings are commenting on my operative skills and are blown away that I have been first assist on so many surgeries in the past. That hands-on surgical experience confirmed my passion for orthopedics and helped prepare me for the next stages of my training.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\nChild neurology. Having that career enrichment in the LIC to explore subspecialties was really helpful so I could hone in on what I did and didn’t like. I came in debating between pediatrics and OB/GYN. And seeing OB subspecialties and Peds subspecialties helped me figure out where I fit in. I realized I wasn’t as interested in procedures as I thought I was coming into the year, and the time to explore helped me learn that about myself and learn where I fit in within medicine.”\n\n– Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I am still slightly undecided. I am interested in Radiology, and the CSB gave me some good opportunities to work on a QI project centered on Radiology, which gave me more experience in that field. It was a great opportunity. I am also interested in anesthesia; having the chance to do more procedures and the dedicated anesthesia time built into the LIC was helpful for that.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“The CSB provided plenty of opportunities to get involved with community events that were happening, such as opportunities to volunteer at the CSB Foot Clinic or pitch in with organizations that reach out to the medical school for volunteer support. I worked at the Refugee Clinic at Peak Vista at one point, which was a really awesome way to see a different aspect the community. If there is a particular population you are interested in, the CSB does a great job finding you a preceptor that works with that population so you can learn more and connect.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I have a much better understanding now of the importance of community engagement, and the role of the physician as someone who gives back to the community. I was able to see that firsthand by working in community settings like Mission Medical Clinic, Memorial Central Hospital, and my psychiatry LIC site at the prison. It is something I am really now prioritizing in a residency program because of how rewarding it was during my third year.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“Working at a federally qualified health center, at Peak Vista, was really helpful as I could see what that patient population was like and really understand their needs. The preceptors showed me the really rewarding things about working there, and how to manage the really challenging things about working with their population. I had a lot of autonomy and got to grow into the primary decision-maker role while working there.”\n\n– Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I worked with InsideOut Youth Services, a non-profit organization that serves LGBTQ+ youth in Southern Colorado. I worked with them on exploring ways to expand health care access for that population in our community. I was in a working group with other partners like the Health Department, the community mental health network, and invested clinicians to expand inclusive care and mental health care for that population.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“My service learning was at The Resource Exchange, which services individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities; it was important to have something connecting me to the community throughout the LIC year because otherwise it can be so all-encompassing to be learning clinical medicine. It was helpful to have something outside my clinical learning that I was passionate about built IN to the curriculum in a way to keep me connected to a population I care about.”\n\n- Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I produced a QI project at Evan’s Army Hospital’s Internal Medicine Clinic focused on identifying colorectal cancer screening gaps in care during annual visits. I actually had my project accepted to a national QI conference at Johns Hopkins at the end of 3rd year!”\n\n- Matt Genelin, CSB Class of 2023\n\n“I was able to work with the Radiology Department at Memorial Central and look at STAT MRI requests; we analyzed the indications for the tests and whether the STAT designations were appropriate, and how that correlated with time from order to scan completion. We looked into patterns in STAT image ordering, such as time of day or department of origin. The goal was to ultimately find ways to reduce order-to-image time so that the most urgent scans are done expediently. . .or, if there really are that many STAT images leading to long delays, we could use this data to justify investment in another MRI machine.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“I love Colorado Springs so much! Coming into my year in The Springs I was very apprehensive as people in Denver have strong feelings about The Springs and we hear those things. I was apprehensive about how I would fit in as a woman of color. But none of those worries came to fruition when I was here, and I found it to be a very accepting community. And anything that DID come up, I have experienced in other places too. And it is so beautiful here; on the days when I was so tired, or the morning was so early, I would look up at the mountains and they would help me gain perspective and stay grounded through the year. I wouldn’t have had that in Denver because the skyline is quite different.”\n\n- Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“It’s a wonderful place if you are outdoorsy. The community is really welcoming, and it is a very fun place to be a clerkship student because you can access nature (like Garden of the Gods or other hikes or skiing) so easily. When your time is limited, having things like that right out your back door makes it much easier to take care of yourself during the clinical year. And great coffee shops!”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“Southern Colorado is gorgeous (even more than Denver, I’d say!). It is a smaller city to live in, cheaper, but still so much going on outside of the hospitals. Outside clinical duties, we would go on hikes, downtown to the local restaurants/breweries, and when we wanted to get back to Denver, it’s a quick drive back up! The population is just as complex as the big city but with small community heart and personality.”\n\n- Matt Genelin, CSB Class of 2023\n\n“I lived in Pueblo, which is my hometown. Some of my LIC experiences were in Pueblo, and I commuted to Colorado Springs for others. One of my favorite things about Southern Colorado is that it’s not Denver traffic! It’s easy to connect to community. Even though it’s not MY thing, the mountains are close if you are interested in that sort of things.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“It was a complete change of pace. It was very nice to head to Colorado Springs with a small group of people that I already knew and had become friends with in the first year. It was so nice to have our learning seminars in a group of 24 instead of 180. There was great attention to detail from the coordinators and faculty leaders, and I could develop relationships with faculty on a more individual basis than I had been able to in a larger group.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“I really loved it, and it was hard for me to go back to the large group learning experience in third year. I learn better in small learning groups; I wouldn’t necessarily raise my hand in a group of 180 students, but in a group of 24 I felt more comfortable. It helped me stay accountable to my learning because I felt more comfortable speaking up.”\n\n- Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n\"Moving south with a small cohort was amazing. The clinical year is difficult (you work longer hours than you have before, study harder, and are busy more days of the week). But having a small cohort doing the same as you with structured time to hang out each week was amazing — I can confidently say my CSB cohort colleagues are my life-long closest friends!”\n\n- Matt Genelin, CSB Class of 2023\n\n“I thought it was a great opportunity to get to know classmates more closely and make new friendships, and build a bond with a closer cohort of students. That has easily translated forward to good friendships and a group of classmates that you can rely on.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“Have fun! It’s all really fun! Don’t lose yourself in the stress of it. Don’t forget that you worked really hard to be here, and it should be as much fun as it possibly can be. Favorite study spot? That has to be Frankly Coffee. Favorite Hike: Garden of the Gods – I love going running there.”\n\n- Jack Schutz, CSB Class of 2024\n\n“Everyone should do the Manitou Incline at least once: super hard and super fun. I mean I didn’t love it WHILE I was doing it, but afterwards I was so glad I did! It is so easy to get caught up in studying for the next exam or preparing for your next clinic, but towards the end I began going out for walks in the woods by where I lived, and it made a difference. Carve out small bits of time to be in nature during your year.”\n\n- Anima Shrestha, CSB Class of 2025\n\n“You HAVE to try pizza at White Pie!! And when it’s warm, head over for a hike on Columbine Trail or explore the Bear Creek Dog Park. And the best Mexican food is The Loop in Manitou Springs!” *Dr. Cassidy, LIC Director: I disagree! I think it’s Crystal Park Cantina!\n\n- Matt Genelin, CSB Class of 2023\n\n“The CSB plans a lot of social gatherings to get us out of the classroom. Take part in those! It’s a great way to be with your peers and your faculty outside of the classroom.”\n\n- Ryan Turner, CSB Class of 2025\n\nCSB students work in multiple health systems to understand the interface between academic and community medicine, and experience the mosaic of private, corporate, military, non‐profit, and public service organizations that come together to care for a community. We prioritize community engagement institutionally & via the volunteerism, advocacy, and project work of our faculty and students. Clinical placements, projects, scholarship, and extra-curricular opportunities are crafted to support students' immersion in the community, and throughout the LIC we explore ways in which a physician's expertise and voice can advance health equity through community engagement.\n\nOur community partnerships include:\n\nCSB Saturdays at Mission Medical Center: CSB Students staff a monthly free clinic at Mission Medical Center, providing primary care and behavioral health care for under-resourced adults. This is an interprofessional collaboration with the School of Pharmacy, with medical students and pharmacy students working together in the care of MMC's patients.\n\nCSB Quarterly Foot Care Clinic at Springs Rescue Mission: CSB students lead a quarterly foot care clinic for our unhoused neighbors in collaboration with Springs Rescue Mission, Peak Vista Health Centers, and local clinicians.\n\nFridays at the Marian House: CSB students and faculty staff the Homeless Clinic at the Marian House's Soup Kitchen for walk-in Urgent Care and Primary Care services every Friday.\n\nNear-Peer Mentoring with School District 11: CSB Students partner with a myriad of schools across El Paso County to demystify careers in the health professions for students who might not otherwise consider careers in medicine.\n\nThe Therapeutic Recreation Center: CSB students work alongside TRP staff to develop educational programming for youth and adults with disabilities. Programming examples include workshops on nutrition, resilience, and grief.\n\nThe Resource Exchange: CSB students collaborate with TRE to research and advocate for health equity for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs).\n\nFront Range AHEC: CSB students partner with FRAHEC, the leader in local refugee resettlement, to perform home visits and develop health education for local refugees newly resettling in the El Paso County region.\n\nEverythingForSight: CSB students partner with agency leaders to develop free or reduced-cost eye care solutions for local patients who don't have medical insurance to cover the cost of sight-saving surgery.\n\nInsideOut Youth Services: CSB students collaborate with InsideOut in a variety of ways ranging from serving on health equity tasks forces to developing health education or near-peer mentoring for local LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nThe Place: CSB students develop programming for homeless youth living at or receiving services through The Place, a shelter and service agency that helps youth exit homelessness.\n\nGazette Charities: CSB students partner with Gazette Charities for health policy analysis and strategic planning on health equity initiatives.\n\nSilver Key: CSB Students work with Silver Key on a variety of quality improvement and program develop initiatives in the service of seniors in our community.\n\nWe are excited to announce that these former CSB LIC students have returned to practice in Southern Colorado!\n\nDr. Lindsey Romero\n\nCU Class of 2018\n\nResidency: Southern Colorado Family Medicine, Pueblo, CO\n\nCurrent Work place and/or roles: Sandstone Care, Regional Medical Director- Colorado\n\nWhy I came back to Southern Colorado to practice: Returning to Southern Colorado to practice was always my plan! Raised here, I’m deeply connected to the community, and I aspire to contribute to its betterment. Plus, the climate and abundant access to recreational activities make it an ideal place to live, work, and play, fostering both personal and professional fulfillment.\n\nDr. Morgan Meury\n\nCU Class of 2018 - I had the privilege of being part of the first class to participate in the Colorado Springs Branch.\n\nResidency: Emergency Medicine at the University of New Mexico.\n\nCurrent Work place and/or roles: Parkview Medical Center, Pueblo Colorado\n\nWhy I came back to Southern Colorado to practice: I made a deliberate and heartfelt decision to return to my roots in Southern Colorado. This choice was driven by a combination of personal and professional factors. Colorado Springs is where I grew up and where I first envisioned a future as a physician. Returning allows me to give back to the community that shaped me. Simultaneously, I have strong family connections in the area which help ground me. Having grown up in Colorado Springs, I am intimately familiar with the distinct challenges our community faces. My involvement with the Colorado Springs Branch provided me with crucial insights and a different perspective into the local dynamics of the community. This has enabled me to foster collaboration among local clinics and community health organizations. I can bridge the gap between emergency care and follow-up services ensuring continuity for patients thanks in part to the education I received. In returning to Colorado Springs, I am not just practicing medicine; I am an integral part of a dedicated team, committed to the well-being of our patients. While I carry with me the lessons learned from experiences far and wide, my heart remains firmly rooted in the place I have always called home. I am excited to build upon this foundation and continue to inform positive health outcomes within the area."
