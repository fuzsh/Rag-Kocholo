        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - As Senate Bill 184 passes the House Transportation, Housing, and Local Government committee Tuesday, it’s one step closer to becoming a law with just less than three weeks left in Colorado’s legislative session.\n\nThe bill proposes increasing rental car fees by up to $3 per day, allowing the state to collect $50 million to go toward the long-discussed Front Range passenger railway. That $50 million would just be a 20% down payment of the total project cost. Senate President Steve Fenberg says the U.S. government’s bipartisan infrastructure grants would fund the rest, where there’s a pool of $66 million available at the national level for transit projects.\n\n“The potential for the federal government to pay up to 80% of the project is incredibly exciting, kind of a game changer for financing large infrastructure projects like this,” Fenberg told 11 News Reporter Melissa Henry. “Colorado is only one of two projects that was not only accepted, but they were sort of fast-tracked to a more advanced state of the grant process, so we feel Colorado is very well positioned to get the grant from this pool of funds.”\n\nThere is some pushback rooted in those increased rental car fees.\n\nSenator Kevin Van Winkle from Douglas County said in a video posted to the Colorado Senate GOP Youtube account, “Senate bill 184 will expand government and impose a daily fee on rental cars in our state with the aim of using these funds to build a new multi-billion dollar train network across the front range. While the idea of front range metro rail might seem attractive to some, the people of Colorado cannot afford to foot the bill for such a project, especially during the ongoing affordability crisis ... Senate Bill 184 is just one of many bills Coloradans can expect that will levy costly fees on Coloradans to fund this project.”-- Sen. Van Winkle\n\nThe bill already passed the state senate. All bills that are going to be singed into law this year need to make it to Governor Polis’s desk by May 10, when legislative session ends."
