        "text": "Kinship Landing, a boutique hotel in downtown Colorado Springs, offers a unique way to urban camp—guests can pitch a tent on its turf-covered rooftop Camp Deck. The camp site is available for groups of up to six people and includes access to a private heated bathroom with a sink, shower, toilet, and Brooklinen towels. There are also spots to hang your hammock and a Bluetooth speaker system. The first floor has a bar and restaurant, and local eateries like White Pie Pizza and Shuga’s are within two blocks—you’re in the heart of downtown, after all. And while you’re not exactly roughing it, there are stellar views of Pikes Peak.\n\n\"Colorado is best explored via a clockwise loop of a road trip, the next stop Colorado Springs, whose sluggish downtown and crush of outlying big-box stores might fool travelers into speeding on through. But park for a night at Kinship Landing — a modern-meets-mountain boutique hotel — if for no other reason than to wander out into the desert in search of the Paint Mines Interpretive Park, a magical oasis of multicolored hoodoos and sandstone-capped spires. Stopping for a craft beer and some solid pub grub at Phantom Canyon Brewing Co.\"\n\n\"Need to test your new camping gear before heading to the backcountry? Or do you wish to give inexperienced travel companions a taste of the outdoors before going \"all in\"? This hotel offers a great solution. It has a unique outside “guest room” within the hotel (also called the camping deck), which is booked like any other room, but it's ready for a tent set-up and camp chairs. Fortunately, unlike the wilderness, it comes with the comforts of home, including a modern bathroom and a shower.\"\n\n\"We stayed in a junior suite. The design helped the small space feel just right with wood wrapping around one half of the room and elevating the bed in front of the window. For people without dogs, spacious king suites with floating bathtubs in front of a fireplace are equally suitable for a staycation as they are for someone who wants to stretch out for a long stay to explore Colorado Springs.\"\n\n1. Kinship Landing opened in downtown Colorado Springs in 2020, a conveniently located hotel for visitors who might want to walk to the new U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum or be a short drive from Garden of the Gods Park. One of its coolest features, however, is its camping deck, an unexpected glamping option. Unlike when booking a typical hotel room, you must bring all of your own camping gear. Unlike a typical camping trip, there is indoor plumbing in a private bathroom and a restaurant downstairs.\n\nMidwest\n\nKinship Landing; Colorado\n\nThis new boutique hotel is centered around exploring the Rocky Mountains. Book a pet-friendly room where your pup will score a comfy designer dog bed.\n\nThe concierge will put together a customized dog-friendly itinerary, complete with the best hikes. Order your pooch a doggie bowl with local grains, sweet potato, and egg at the property’s Homa Café — then head out to the mountains. Relax in front of your personal fireplace, and open your room’s overhead garage doors to turn it into an indoor/outdoor viewing deck for Pikes Peak.\n\nFrom Denver it’s just an hour south to Colorado Springs, where sandstone rock formations and 21 miles of trails at Garden of the Gods are worth pulling over for. Front Range Climbing leads guided rock climbing within the city-owned park (which is free to visit). Spend the night at Kinship Landing (from $49), a new boutique hotel that opened this year with high-end bunk rooms, as well as a fourth-floor outdoor camping room where you can pitch a tent (bring your own or rent one from the hotel) and take in the views of 14,115-foot Pikes Peak.\n\nFour new hotels are already underway or open in Downtown Colorado Springs, but one in particular is as focused on the city as it is on its out-of-town guests. Kinship Landing was specifically designed not just to welcome travelers, but to serve as a hub for locals, naturally mingling the two crowds that have plenty to share with each other, given the opportunity. The 80-bed boutique certainly offers lux options with suites that include fully-opening garage door windows, LED fireplaces and extravagant soaking tubs, but it’s the other end of the spectrum that makes this property seriously special. Co-founded by world travelers on a budget, Kinship Landing offers high quality hostel accommodations in a full-service hotel with bunk rooms so chill you may want to stay there no matter your budget.\n\nMaybe you’ve known the Springs as just a mid-size city in the shadow of Pikes Peak, but take one stroll through downtown and you’ll realize the city has evolved in countless ways over the past half decade. It’s not only seen a boom in population, it’s become a breeding ground for innovation and the wellspring of a cultural renaissance.\n\n“We’re shaking up the Springs,” says Aaron Ewton, owner of Atlas Restaurant Group and the mind behind the newly opened CO.A.T.I culinary incubator. “And I love seeing that occur.”\n\nWhile the Springs’ downtown was once marked by untapped potential, Ewton says all that began to change a few years ago when a new generation of business owners reimagined the city and began to reclaim its reputation. The result has been a diverse mix of restaurants, hospitality concepts, and other small businesses. In addition to CO.A.T.I, the downtown district’s awakening is headlined by the boutique-style Kinship Landing hotel, a new professional soccer stadium for the Switchbacks FC, and the much-anticipated United States Olympic & Paralympic Museum—all of which opened within the last year despite COVID-19. In fact, the number of small businesses in Downtown Colorado Springs grew over the course of the pandemic, with more than 20 street-level businesses opening in 2020 alone and more than two dozen already announced for 2021.\n\nThe backstory: Husband and wife Bobby and Brooke Mikulas and their friend Nate Grimm cemented their friendship over ice climbing adventures and a shared passion for travel, having visited nearly 20 countries. Their vision was to create a place for locals and travelers to connect over adventures. Bobby likes to say Colorado Springs has so much to offer but it takes a while to discover the area’s best secrets. Kinship Landing is a fast track to belonging. They’ve taken all of their experiences traveling the globe to create an incredibly thoughtful hotel. Guests in shared bunk rooms have access to a communal kitchen on the second floor and a sound machine turns on at 10pm in shared accommodations to ensure a sound sleep. There is also an option for gear storage and common showers."
