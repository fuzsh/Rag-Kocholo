        "text": "4.2 Heat Waves and Cold Waves\n\nOverview\n\nAs the climate warms, periods of extreme heat are expected to become more frequent, while periods of extreme cold become less frequent (USGCRP 2017). Two different approaches can be employed to investigate changes in temperature extremes. One is to consider the exceedance of absolute temperature thresholds (e.g., exceeding 95Â°F or dropping below 0Â°F). The advantage of this method is that these thresholds are familiar to people, and they generally correspond to some kind of impact (e.g., heat stress to humans and animals increases at higher temperatures). The disadvantage is that, in a state as diverse as Colorado, some areas surpass these thresholds many times per year, whereas other areas may never experience those temperatures. Another method is to consider temperatures that are rare for that location (e.g., a temperature that occurs on average only once per year, or that exceeds a percentile, etc.). Furthermore, when considering heat waves and cold waves, many different definitions have been proposed in the literature (e.g., Perkins and Alexander 2013). Regardless of the specific methods used, available data show that heat waves are generally becoming more frequent, and cold waves less frequent, in Colorado. However, the details of the results vary, as shown below.\n\nObserved heat and cold wave changes\n\nChanges in exceedance of high and low absolute temperature thresholds\n\nComparing the most recent two decades (2001-2020) to the 1971-2000 period shows that in eastern Colorado and the valleys in western Colorado, the number of hot days (95Â°F or higher) has increased. Some areas experienced over 10 more hot days per year during the period from 2001-2020 than during the period from 1971-2000 (Fig. 4.1a). Other thresholds such as 90Â°F show similar spatial patterns; although many areas in Colorado, especially at high elevations, rarely or never reach 90Â°F.\n\nVery cold nights are becoming less frequent across Colorado but generally at a slower pace than hot days are increasing. Fig. 4.1b shows that the San Luis Valley has experienced the greatest reduction in sub-zero temperatures, by a few days per year. Most other parts of the state have relatively small reductions of 1-2 nights per year, whereas a few pockets in Gunnison, Fremont, and Rio Blanco Counties have seen small increases in the frequency of sub-zero temperatures. In some areas of southeastern Colorado, temperatures below zero are very rare.\n\nCalculations at individual stations (not shown) are generally consistent with the findings from the gridded dataset used in Fig. 4.1. However, this gridded dataset only has daily data available back to 1951, and long-term stations in southeastern Colorado show that the dust bowl era in the 1930s had more frequent occurrence of extreme heat than even the first two decades of the 2000s. Nonetheless, recent trends in this part of the state are toward more frequent hot days.\n\nFigure 4.1\n\nDifferences in the number of days per year with (a) daily maximum temperature â¥ 95Â°F, and (b) daily minimum temperature â¤ 0Â°F, comparing the period 2001-2020 to 1971-2000.\n\nDownload Figure\n\nChanges in occurrence of heat waves and cold waves\n\nIn contrast to the absolute temperature thresholds presented above, heat waves and cold waves are generally defined relative to the historical temperature ranges for an area. Some studies consider heat/cold waves as consecutive days exceeding a threshold (Perkins and Alexander 2013; Keellings and Moradkhani 2020; Domeisen et al. 2023), whereas others consider the average temperature over a period of days (Peterson et al. 2013). Here, we will use a definition for heat and cold waves that is similar to Peterson et al. (2013). Specifically, a heat wave or cold wave is defined using a 4-day averaged daily mean temperature (daily mean is the average of the high and low for the day). The 4-day average temperature that was exceeded on average once per year during 1971-2000 was defined as a heat or cold wave (in other words, the average hottest or coldest 4-day period per year during 1971-2000). This calculation is done for each alternate climate division, and then the number of heat/cold waves in each year and decade over the full dataset (1951-2022) were calculated. Other definitions of heat/cold waves, including different lengths and requiring consecutive days exceeding a threshold, showed qualitatively similar results. The benefits of this calculation are 1) it includes both maximum and minimum temperature in the analysis, 2) the four-day average indicates a sustained period of hot or cold (thus a âwaveâ), and 3) the extreme threshold is uniquely defined for each climate division.\n\nHeat waves have increased in frequency from the 1950s to present in all climate divisions (Fig. 4.2), though the upward trend is statistically significant in only 8 of the 11 divisions. In particular, the decades of the 2000s and 2010s had substantially more heat waves than the preceding decades in nearly all divisions. The increases are especially large in the Northwest and Mesas & Valleys divisions, where very few heat waves occurred in the 1950s and 60s, and then 2-3 per year occurred on average in the 2000s and 2010s. The increase in heat waves has been less prominent in the Northeast and Southeast divisions (Fig. 4.2), despite the total number of hot days increasing (Fig. 4.1a).\n\nFigure 4.2\n\nTime series of the number of 4-day heat waves per decade from 1951-2020 for each climate division. (See Fig. 2.2 for the names of the divisions.) Heat waves are defined as a 4-day period in which the daily mean temperature (the sum of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures divided by two), averaged over the four days, exceeds the 4-day average temperature that was exceeded on average once per year during 1971-2000.\n\nDownload Figure\n\nData for 2021-22 (not included in the decadal analysis above) revealed a large number of heat waves in all parts of the state; in some divisions, there were more heat waves in the first two years of the 2020s than in some entire decades in the 20th century.\n\nCold waves have generally declined in frequency across Colorado from 1951-2020, but the decline is much less pronounced than the increase in heat waves (Fig. 4.3). The decrease in 4-day cold waves was not found to be statistically significant in any of the climate divisions. In most divisions, the 1970s and 80s had a large number of cold waves; then, they declined in the 1990s and 2000s before increasing slightly in the 2010s.\n\nFigure 4.3\n\nAs in Fig. 4.2, but for 4-day cold waves.\n\nDownload Figure\n\nFuture heat and cold wave projections\n\nResearch has consistently indicated that heat waves are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in a warmer climate (Domeisen et al. 2023). In one study relevant to Colorado, Cowan et al. (2020) examined what would happen if the anomalous conditions associated with the Dust Bowl-era heat waves occurred in the present-day climate. They found that those 1930s heat waves that had a probability of around 1 in 100 years, would have a probability closer to 1 in 40 years today (and a higher probability in an even warmer climate). They also illuminate the impact of dry springs, noting that summer heat waves are generally more frequent and intense following a dry spring as compared to a wet spring.\n\nThe 32 CMIP5-LOCA model projections for medium-low emissions scenario RCP4.5 (described in Chapter 2.2) were analyzed using the same definitions of heat waves and cold waves that were used for observed conditions. Specifically, the 4-day average temperature (hot or cold) that was exceeded on average once per year during 1971-2000 was identified in each individual model run, and then occurrences of those temperatures in daily CMIP5-LOCA output from 1951-2090 were tabulated.\n\nHeat waves are projected to increase at a rapid pace in all parts of Colorado as the climate warms. In most regions, the median number of projected heat waves is expected to increase from 1 per year during 1971-2000 (by definition; not shown), to approximately 10 per year by the 2060s (Fig. 4.4). Some projections show a smaller increase in the number of heat waves, others a much larger one. All model projections show a statistically significant increase in heat waves from the 1950s to the 2080s in all regions; at least 90% of the model projections show a significant increase in heat waves from the 2000s to the 2080s in all regions except the Southeast (where there is 87.5% agreement among models for a significant increase). To put these results in other terms: what would have been the hottest 4-day period of each year during 1971-2000 is projected to occur approximately 10 times--spanning 40 days per year--by the 2060s.\n\nFigure 4.4\n\nTime series of the number of 4-day heat waves per decade from 2001-2090 in CMIP5-LOCA projections for each cli- mate division. (See Fig. 2.2 for the names of the divisions.) The red bars indicate the median projection for each decade, and the lines indicate the 10th and 90th percentile of the 32 projections. Heat waves are defined as a 4-day period in which the daily mean temperature (the sum of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures divided by two), averaged over the four days, exceeds the 4-day average temperature that was modeled on average once per year during 1971-2000 in each individual model projection.\n\nDownload Figure\n\nAlthough extreme cold is also generally expected to decrease in frequency as the climate warms (e.g., USGCRP 2017), in Colorado, both observations (Fig. 4.3) and future projections (Fig. 4.5) indicate that cold waves will not decrease nearly as much as heat waves increase. Whereas model projections indicate that heat waves will increase in frequency by as much as ten-fold, similarly defined cold waves are projected to decrease in frequency by half, or even less, depending on the region (Fig. 4.5). There is also much less agreement on the robustness of the trend: fewer than half of CMIP5-LOCA projections show a statistically significant decrease in 4-day cold waves across the 21st century. In most regions, the frequency of cold waves decreases from roughly once per year in the early 21st century, to roughly once per two years by late century.\n\nFigure 4.5\n\nAs in Fig. 4.4, but for cold waves.\n\nDownload Figure\n\nThe strong asymmetry in the projections of heat waves and cold waves in a warmer climate is likely to have impacts on the agricultural sector in Colorado. As one example, western Colorado has had several instances in the early 21st century of extremely hot summers punctuated by strong cold waves in the fall and spring that have led to the loss of fruit crops (NOAA 2020a). Challenges such as these may become more acute in the future, as periods of extreme heat become much more frequent, but the risk of extreme cold remains.\n\n4.4 Wildfire\n\nOverview\n\nThe occurrence and behavior of wildfires in the western U.S. are strongly influenced by weather and climate, and they are especially linked to drought conditions (Littell et al. 2009; Hostetler et al. 2018). Below-normal winter and spring precipitation and early meltout of the snowpack are linked with dry fuels and greater fire activity in subsequent months. Shorter periods of far-below-normal precipitation can lead to dry fuels and increased fire activity at any time of the year. High temperatures â whether as part of a drought or a long-term trend â hasten the drying of fuels, making fire ignition, fire spread, and intense fire behavior more likely. Fires are also much more likely to spread and exhibit intense behavior on days with high winds and low humidity. Note that in some vegetation types, such as grasslands and shrublands, wet growing seasons that lead to temporarily high fuel loads may be required for fire to spread during subsequent drier periods.\n\nWildfire occurrence and behavior are also driven by several non-climatic factors, such as the legacies of historical forest and land management (e.g., fire suppression) and resulting changes in fuel loads. Additionally, increasing human activity and development of houses and other structures within fire-dependent forest, shrublands, and grasslands leads to more ignitions year-round.\n\nObserved wildfire changes\n\nOver the past 20 to 40 years, the Western U.S. has experienced several linked trends in wildfires: large increases in annual area burned, number of very large fires (>10,000 acres), fraction of fire area burned at high severity, and length of the fire season (Dennison et al. 2014; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Westerling 2016; Parks and Abatzoglou 2020; Higuera et al. 2021; Parks et al. 2023). While these trends are also affected by non-climatic factors (Balch et al. 2017; Radeloff et al. 2018) and by multidecadal variability in precipitation, a critical common thread is the role of increasing temperatures. Two recent studies found that anthropogenic climate change, via warmer temperatures and resulting increases in fuel dryness across the region, could account for half or more of the recent increase in annual area burned (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Zhuang et al. 2021). However, Holden et al. (2018) found that, while acknowledging the role of warming temperatures, a declining trend in summer precipitation was the primary driver.\n\nThese West-wide increasing trends in wildfire are very clearly expressed in Colorado. Figure 4.8 shows the number of very large Colorado wildfires (over 10,000 acres), and the total area burned in those fires, from 1984 through 2020. From 1984-1999, there were 8 wildfires larger than 10,000 acres, and records suggest that only two additional fires that size occurred from 1950 to 1983. Since 2000, there have been 60 wildfires larger than 10,000 acres, including six fires larger than 100,000 acres; all but one of the latter occurred after 2017. The annual area burned by wildfires in the forested areas of Colorado, and adjacent areas of New Mexico and Wyoming, increased by over 300% from the 1984-2000 period to the 2001-2017 period. The average elevation at which these wildfires occurred shifted upwards by over 1000â between 1984 and 2017, which is consistent with how warming is shifting temperature regimes upslope (Alizadeh et al. 2021).\n\nFigure 4.8\n\nNumber of Colorado wildfires that burned over 10,000 acres, 1984-2020, and total area burned in those fires each year. (Data: Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), https://www.mtbs.gov/direct-download).\n\nDownload Figure\n\nFuture wildfire projections\n\nMany studies have combined climate model projections with observed fire-climate relationships to estimate the impacts of future climate change on wildfires in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain West. These studies have uniformly indicated substantially worsened wildfire risk for Colorado by the mid-21st century compared to the late 20th-century, as additional warming further increases fuel dryness and enhances fire ignition and spread (Liu et al. 2015; Brey et al. 2021; Moritz et al. 2012; Pechony and Shindell 2010; Spracklen et al. 2009; Litschert et al. 2012; Yue et al. 2013; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Westerling 2016; Kitzberger et al. 2017; Littell et al. 2018; Abatzoglou et al. 2021; Brown et al. 2021).\n\nMost of these studies quantified potential changes in annual area burned, collectively indicating a 100-500% increase under a warming of 2.5Â°F to 5Â°F (equivalent to RCP4.5 projections for mid-century). Under the same level of warming, Stavros et al. (2014) projected a 400% increase in the occurrence of very large wildfires (>50,000 acres). In short, studies consistently project a continuation of the recent increasing statewide trends in wildfire, given the near-certain continuation of the recent warming trend. However, some grassland and shrubland ecosystems in which fire is fuel-limited could see reduced fire occurrence as warming leads to overall lower fuel accumulation and continuity (Littell et al. 2018).\n\nWhile post-fire changes to vegetation type, structure, and fuels could eventually limit how much new fire can occur on the landscape in each year or decade (Westerling et al. 2011), such feedback mechanisms will not prevent large, climate-driven increases in average annual burned area from occurring over the next several decades (Abatzoglou et al. 2021).\n\n4.10 Dust-on-snow\n\nOver the past 20 years, the phenomenon of dust-on-snow deposition in Colorado and the West has shifted from a periodic curiosity to a chronic concern for water managers and water users. This shift is due to both a much better understanding of the significant hydrologic effects of dust-on-snow, and an overall increase in the occurrence of dust-on-snow events. Dust-on-snow is also unusual in that the visual appearance is an accurate gauge of the eventual impact on snowpack and runoff; the darker the snow surface, the stronger the dustâs radiative forcing (i.e., enhancing the sunâs energy) on snowmelt.\n\nDust-deposition events in Colorado typically occur during large-scale storms that move in from the southwest, most frequently in the spring (Painter et al. 2018). Strong winds in these storms pick up fine soil particles in the Colorado Plateau from lands that have been disturbed by grazing, oil and gas drilling, dryland agriculture, and off-road vehicle use (Duniway et al. 2019). Dust deposition on snowpacks and its impacts, are usually greatest in the San Juans, closest to this primary source (Painter et al. 2012; Skiles et al. 2015). Yet, the dust may be transported hundreds of miles to all of Coloradoâs mountains, including the east slope of the Front Range. The dust layers from each event are often buried by subsequent snows, but then reemerge and coalesce at the snow surface as the snowpack compacts and melts down in late spring.\n\nLake-sediment cores from the San Juans show a several-fold increase in dust deposition starting in the mid-1800s through the 20th century (Neff et al. 2008). Dust mobility and deposition increased again around 2000, due to increasing aridity in the source areas and more widespread disturbance of the soils (Brahney et al. 2013).\n\nMultiple studies have shown that dust loading in the snowpack alters the energy balance of snowmelt, enhances melt rates, and advances the timing of spring runoff by up to 3-6 weeks (Painter et al. 2018; Skiles et al. 2015; Painter et al. 2010; Deems et al. 2013). Modeling studies suggest that dust-on-snow deposition over the 20th and early 21st centuries has reduced natural streamflows from the Upper Colorado River Basin by about 5%, or 800,000 acre-feet, compared to pre-1800s low-dust conditions (Painter et al. 2010). This is mainly due to earlier meltout of snowpacks and increased evapotranspiration from soils and vegetation that are exposed and growing earlier in the season.\n\nIn a warmer future climate, overall drier soil conditions in the dust source region are very likely, which will tend to reduce vegetation cover and allow for greater dust emission, given the same level of disturbance (Munson et al. 2011). Further warming, like dust-on-snow, will tend to drive even earlier snowmelt and runoff. The only study to jointly model dust-on-snow and warming found that runoff timing remains strongly affected by dust under a variety of future warming scenarios (Deems et al. 2013). However, in a significantly warmer mid-century climate, going from âmoderateâ dust to âextremeâ dust has no additional effect on runoff volume."
