        "text": "This land acknowledgement and history was compiled by Haseya Advocate Program, shared here with permission.\n\nWe acknowledge that the land on which the City of Colorado Springs stands is the homeland and unceded historic territory of many Native American Nations. The very founding and development of our city was in direct violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. The Nuuchiu (pronounced New-chew, meaning “the People”), or the Utes, are the longest continuous Indigenous inhabitants of what is now Colorado.\n\nAccording to Nuuchiu oral history, they have no migration story and their people have been here since time immemorial. According to the oral history of the Kapuuta (Kah-poo-tah) and Mouache (Mow-ah-ch), two of the twelve historic bands within the Nuuchiu Nation, Pikes Peak is one of the places where the Creator placed their Ancestors.\n\nA minimum of 48 federally recognized Sovereign Nations that include the Kiowa, Jicarilla Apache, Comanche, Cheyenne and Arapaho also all have historic ties to this place and continue to foster their relationships with this land. We recognize that members of these tribes remain the dedicated stewards of their sacred homelands; to include the land, water, plants, and animals that call this place home. We acknowledge that Indigenous people continue to contribute to the existing culture of the Pikes Peak region as there are currently members of over 100 tribal nations living and thriving here today.\n\nAcknowledging the events of the past, even when painful, is crucial in honoring the truth of our collective histories and demonstrating our respect for the original inhabitants of modern-day Colorado Springs, their ancestors, and their future generations. By taking the time to consider the violence, displacement, forced migration, and settlement that has brought us together today, we can continue to uncover the truth of the past and work toward the recognition and abatement of ongoing colonialism throughout the Native lands that make up North America. We must also refute the colonized notion of manifest destiny when discussing our nation’s history of westward expansion.\n\nMany of the early founders of our community – AJ Templeton, Irving Howbert, Anthony Bott, John Wolfe, and many others were members of the 3rd Colorado Calvary (made up primarily of men from El Paso and Pueblo counties) which camped in what is now Old Colorado City prior to participating in the Sand Creek Massacre which resulted in the murder of hundreds of Cheyenne and Arapaho people, mostly women and children. These men’s names are still honored throughout our community as their lasting legacy of violence.\n\nThis Land Acknowledgment must be more than a symbolic gesture of simply addressing our past but will represent the City of Colorado Springs’ commitment to our ongoing future relationships by continuing to consult with tribal governments, evaluating Indigenous representation throughout our city, and shedding light on our own difficult history."
