        "text": "Why Micropiles might be the best repair technology for your home.\n\nFor those of us who have called the Front Range their home for quite some time, we know that it is par for the course to seek foundation repair solutions due to the expansive soils that are native to the Boulder area. The Front Range and Rocky Mountain area create the perfect environment for swelling soil because of the mineral composition and weathering that occurs in the conditions that this area is known for.\n\nVan Matre Construction of Boulder has years of experience working in this environment. As such, we completely understand how to provide solutions for the particular expansive soils that call the Boulder area home. These soils can be extremely hard and dense, making standard methods of foundation repair, such as the installation of helical piers and push piers, less effective than they are typically known to be. Van Matre Construction has accommodated these harsh and difficult conditions and has heavily invested in the best technology available for our region. We have found that micropile equipment is the best option for our swelling soils. Our micropile installation services can provide foundational support quickly, effectively, and powerfully!\n\nMicropiles often have a diameter that measures anywhere between 3 and 10 inches. This casing of the micropile is then used at a depth that is ideal for whatever must be addressed, such as reinforcing steel. The micropile casing then has a strong grout mixture inserted. The result is an incredibly strong and durable micropile that has been measured to hold loads of more than 500 tons, making them impressively small and immensely powerful.\n\nMicropiles are the more expensive alternative to helical piers. However, micropiles are able to reach depths that are significantly deeper than what helical piers are capable of, making them worth the investment for a situation in which helical piers or push piers are incapable of providing substantial support."
