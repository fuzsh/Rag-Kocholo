        "text": "Please check back for a comprehensive open house summary coming soon.\n\nIn May and June, 2022, the City of Colorado Springs and ConnectCOS project team hosted six in-person open houses, one in each council district. Three of the open houses included information from the Platte Avenue Corridor Study. Participants were invited to explore different information developed over the life of the project, ask project team questions, and share their feedback. We invite you to explore ConnectCOS and the Platte Avenue Corridor Study in greater depth. For your convenience we offer an introductory video highlighting the questions our team set out to answer, what was found, and potential ideas for the future. In addition to the videos, you’ll find PDFs summarizing each open house station. Once you’ve reviewed the open house boards and project video, we have developed a survey to let your voice on what you liked, disliked, and what was missing from the proposed project.\n\nVideo\n\nThe video linked below is a recorded slideshow. Please note, the audio requires permission from you to play. You will need to interact with the presentation by hitting pause/play or skipping to the next slide at least once to give the browser permission to play audio.\n\nWatch the video exploring ConnectCOS\n\nStation Boards\n\nPlease use the links below to navigate to each station’s board.

To provide additional comments, please email the project team at connectcos@coloradosprings.gov. Please check back soon for the comprehensive open house summary.\n\nColorado Springs is launching a citywide visionary transportation study, ConnectCOS to help create a transportation plan that reflects the evolving needs of our community\n\nThe city has changed a lot since the last update to our major transportation plan (the Intermodal Transportation Plan) almost 20 years ago. Now is the time to review our current transportation system and develop a plan to ensure an efficient, accessible, safe, and well-connected network for people who drive, walk, bike and take public transit.\n\nPlanCOS, the City’s comprehensive plan that was adopted by City Council in 2019, outlined big ideas to shape the future of our city. ConnectCOS will lay out the next 20 years of transportation planning, infrastructure, and improvements in Colorado Springs, bringing to life the goals, ideas and community values established in PlanCOS.\n\nConnectCOS is a year-long study that will involve a significant technical analysis, and robust community engagement effort, to identify and prioritize short and long-term transportation projects to ensure that people who live, work and play in Colorado Springs have an opportunity to participate in the study.\n\nDraft Project Goals\n\nThere are six major goal areas that build on the full range of opportunities identified in ConnectCOS:\n\nEfficient\n\nSustainable\n\nReliable\n\nAccessible\n\nConnected\n\nSafe\n\nOver the next several months the project team will continue to refine the goals of ConnectCOS to meet the needs of the community. Please check back soon to take our transportation survey that will help inform the final goals.\n\nPriority Corridors\n\nThe six-mile Platte Avenue Corridor, that extends from I-25 to Powers Boulevard, has been selected as the first Priority Corridor for analysis through the ConnectCOS study. For more information about this corridor study and to participate visit www.ColoradoSprings.gov/PlatteAveCorrirdor.\n\nConnectCOS is being built on a framework of six goal identified by stakeholder and public input as areas where performance of the existing transportation system should be improved. This framework guides the analysis process and the development of potential projects and other actions that will improve system performance. The resulting actions will create a transportation system that is more safe, equitable, sustainable, efficiently reliable, accessible, and connected.\n\nSafe\n\nThis goal area reflects a paramount desire of the community to have a safe transportation system. A safety goal of no fatalities or serious injuries involving transportation can be applied to identify and implement countermeasures.\n\nThe ConnectCOS goal framework also considers a wider range of considerations to looks at safety from personal and community perspective. Example questions include:\n\nDo our transportation systems provide personal safety for those accessing mobility systems including those using trails, transit stops, and parking garages.\n\nIs our transportation system resilient enough to facilitate emergency and natural disaster response?\n\nEquitable\n\nThis goal area captures the concept that investments should enhance mobility and accessibility for everyone. This concept includes application of limited resources to distribute and adjust the type of investment to be appropriate to user needs. The term is not the same as equality, but more importantly recognizes that people, neighborhoods, and communities have differing levels and types of needs.\n\nSustainable\n\nA sustainable transportation system supports the three pillars of sustainability:\n\nEconomic – A system that is affordable and provides individual and community economic benefit\n\nEnvironmental – A system that supports, protects, and enhances our natural environment including air quality\n\nSocial – A system that supports our community’s goal for quality of life, health, and well being\n\nThe ConnectCOS goal framework considers these elements to identify needs and develop appropriate solutions.\n\nEfficiently Reliable\n\nThis unique two-word goal area reflects the balance necessary between having a perfectly reliable system and being efficient with limited resources. Both aspects are desired but are usually in conflict. For example, a roadway corridor that never experiences slow-downs or congestion may be desirable, but the necessary costs and impacts of building such facilities may not be the most efficient.\n\nAccessible\n\nAn accessible transportation system as viewed in the ConnectCOS goal framework provides intuitive choices for all users. It is easy to find your way across town or across the intersection regardless of your mode of travel. Connections between modes are comfortable including those who transition from driving to being a pedestrian to get from your parking to your destination.\n\nConnected\n\nA connected transportation system enables all users to move from homes to services, work to recreation areas, and businesses to shopping destinations. It also connects us to a larger economy beyond the Pikes Peak region. A truly connected system also connects to adjacent land uses, rather than conflict with them. Transportation choices influence land uses both positively and negatively and the right investments in transportation will positively shape our city’s future.\n\nContinuing East-West Mobility town hall\n\nA second town hall was held Saturday, February 4, 2023 to continue discussion of a potential feasibility study addressing east-west mobility.\n\nView the 2/4/23 townhall video\n\nEast-West Mobility town hall: including consideration of the Constitution Avenue extension\n\nA townhall was held January 21, 2023 to discuss a potential study addressing East-West mobility for the Fillmore Street and Uintah Street corridors.\n\nThe following were discussed:\n\nConsider widening Fillmore Street\n\nExtending Constitution Avenue from Union Boulevard to I-25 utilizing existing right-of-way\n\nMaintaining the current roadway configuration with the understanding that traffic congestion and delay will likely increase\n\nView the 1/21/23 townhall video\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFAQs and study guidelines\n\nCorridor map\n\nRock Island right of way\n\nPublic comments\n\nPublic feedback change\n\nJanuary 2022 Virtual Engagement\n\nThe public meeting scheduled to take place on December 15, 2021, was cancelled due to extreme weather and power outages across the City of Colorado Springs. In response, and in an effort to keep the public informed about the ConnectCOS project, a recording of the meeting content is now available for public viewing. The recording includes the information and content that was originally scheduled to be presented.\n\nThe goals of this recording are to:\n\nShare information for the ConnectCOS project\n\nReview analysis to-date, recommendations, and potential ConnectCOS projects\n\nProvide a look ahead and how the public can continue to contribute feedback\n\nWatch the meeting\n\nView the Presentation Slides\n\nView the Critical Corridor Portraits - which outline the potential transportation improvement projects for each of the identified critical corridors in ConnectCOS\n\n**The public comment period is now closed\n\nAugust 2021 Survey Results\n\nThe ConnectCOS digital community survey opened to the public on July 15, 2021 and closed on August 8, 2021. More than 800 people responded to the survey; view the demographic summary of our survey respondents here. Colorado Springs residents were invited to provide input during this timeframe on draft scenarios and priorities to improve the city’s transportation plan as part of ConnectCOS, a citywide visionary transportation study.\n\nResidents who participated in the digital survey provided perspectives and response towards strategies for enhancing the city’s transportation system to create more safe, efficient, accessible, equitable, sustainable and connected modes of travel.\n\nThe results from this public survey are included in the link below and will help shape the draft citywide transportation plan that is anticipated to be ready for public review in early 2022.\n\nView ConnectCOS Survey Summary Report\n\nFebruary 2021 Public Meeting\n\nThursday, February 18\n\nWe hope you were able to attend the virtual public meeting and learn more about the unique transportation needs and challenges facing the City of Colorado Springs as we continue to grow. For example, although most people travel by car, many recognize the need to get around town by bike, foot or transit. The 90-minute meeting provided other valuable input collected from a recent community-wide survey, as well as a high-level project overview. If you missed the meeting, materials are now available below.\n\nView Meeting Presentation | View Meeting Summary\n\nWatch the Meeting\n\nSeptember 2020 Survey Results\n\nApproximately 1,700 Colorado Springs residents responded to the ConnectCOS transportation survey from August 19 – September 21, 2020 (thank you for your participation!). A summary of the results is now available for your review. The survey focused on questions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the City’s current transportation system and solicited information related to travel habits and needs of our community. The results will support ConnectCOS planning efforts to establish a 20-year plan to meet evolving mobility needs of our community. Key highlights from the survey include:\n\n98% of survey respondents have at least one vehicle, however, 65% of respondents feel it is extremely important to have transportation choices such as walking, biking, and taking the bus.\n\nThe community identified the presence of numerous trails as a top strength of the City’s transportation network.\n\nOver 50% of respondents feel that it is easy to walk or use a wheelchair to get to the places they need to go within the City.\n\nThis survey is the first of many as the ConnectCOS project team continues to engage the community throughout 2021. Full results from this first survey will be shared at our upcoming virtual public meeting, scheduled for February 18, 5:30 p.m. – 7:00 p.m. Make sure to register here to learn more about the project!"
