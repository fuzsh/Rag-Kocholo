Hi All – I live on the Colorado Front Range in a home built in 1947. I bought the place in 1994 and spent about 5 years bringing everything aboveground up to code, including framing, wiring, plumbing, insulation, windows and doors. I’m dealing with a crumbling foundation, however, that is threatening to undermine all of my renovations. The foundation is concrete poured into an uneven trench dug about 10” deep into the soil. There is no steel reinforcement in the foundation. The foundation is steadily breaking apart bit by bit, with new cracks forming every spring after the frost heave season. I’m trying to figure out if there is a way to rebuild or otherwise stabilize the foundation under the existing home, or if I need to scrape it and start over. The home is 1500 square feet, single story, and balloon framed (https://www.oldhouseweb.com/how-to-advice/balloon-framing.shtml), with a main structure of 750 square feet with three additions. Under the main structure a concrete slab was poured between the foundation walls and floor joists were laid directly on the slab. I’ve helped renovated other foundations by jacking up the entire building home and replacing the foundation underneath, however I don’t see how I can do that considering how the home was constructed. But I am curious to hear if anybody on this thread has any suggestions for how we might pull that off? Or are there other methods to replace or stabilize a foundation in situ that you’d recommend I consider? Thank you for any thoughts you might have.
