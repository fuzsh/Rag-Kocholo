        "text": "KENNESAW, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A complicated legal battle is raging in Cobb County over whether a student should be expelled.\n\nIt started in 2023 when a North Cobb High School student was accused of hitting a school resource officer with his car, off-campus. The student, who Atlanta News First is not identifying because he’s a juvenile, was expelled.\n\nThe student’s lawyer, Mike Tafelski, denies the allegations and said the charges were later dropped. But the expulsion remained, so they appealed that decision to the Georgia Board of Education.\n\nRecently, the state sided with the student, saying Cobb County’s off-campus discipline policy was illegal and that he should be allowed to return to school. Days later, the Cobb County School District filed an emergency appeal of the reversal.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Cobb County Superior Court Judge said the student must remain out of school while the appeal makes its way through the court system.\n\n“I’ve been really stressed out. I mean, it is depressing because I don’t get to go to school. I don’t get to have fun with my friends anymore. I don’t get to do the stuff that I used to like to do. And I was looking forward to that when they reversed the decision,” the student told Atlanta News First.\n\nThe case will head to another Cobb County judge, who will listen to arguments and decide if the district’s appeal has any merit.\n\nIn the meantime, the student cannot return to school. His family said they aren’t sure what they’ll do next. Over the last year, the student attended an alternative school."
