        "text": "What are my chances of getting in?\n\nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions about applying to Cambridge.\n\nOn average across all subjects, we typically receive six applications per place, but naturally there is some variation between courses.\n\nCollege choice or making an open application does not affect your chance of being made an offer because we compare all applicants for each subject before selection decisions are finalised.\n\nDirectors of Studies in each subject meet to discuss the overall standard of applications so they can see how their own College’s applicants compare. Then, the best applicants who could not be accepted by their original College can be made an offer by another College through the ‘winter pool’.\n\nThe pool results in many students (986 in the case of the 2024 cycle - about 20 per cent of all offers made) receiving an offer from a College other than the one they applied to. This means that success rates are very similar from College to College.\n\nThe University and Colleges are committed to offering admission to students of the highest academic ability and potential, and would rather admit a strong applicant from the pool than a weaker applicant who applied directly to them (or who was allocated through the open application system).\n\nNB: 'Admissions cycle' refers to the UCAS cycle in which applications were considered. For example, the '2024 cycle' refers to applications made from September 2023 onwards, for courses starting in October 2024 or deferred entry in 2025.\n\nAdmission statistics\n\nFor a snapshot of our application and admissions statistics, please use the graph generator below. More detailed information about the range of data we hold about undergraduate applications is available on Tableau, where you can browse and filter the information you're interested in.\n\nView Tableau data\n\nGraph generator\n\nTo view the graph, select from the options below and click 'Show graph'.\n\nGenerate a graph showing undergraduate application and admissions statistics based on a variety of criteria, including College and course.
