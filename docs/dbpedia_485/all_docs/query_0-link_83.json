        "text": "More than half the people who went to school in Bristol say they were not encouraged to go on to university - and a third didn’t have the opportunities or resources at school to do so.\n\nThat’s the damning finding of a survey which explored why Bristol has one of the best universities in the country, but hardly anyone from Bristol actually goes there.\n\nThe research sought to find out more about why the University of Bristol is ranked as one of the top Russell Group unis in the country, but is in the bottom ten when it comes to Social Inclusion Ranking - whether people from low incomes can and do end up going there.\n\nThe University of Bristol responded to the survey and the statistics published by online tutoring platform MyTutor, by acknowledging it still had ‘significant work to be done’ in getting people from working class backgrounds in Bristol to attend their local uni.\n\nWhat is the issue?\n\nMyTutor said it looked into the issue in Bristol after a series of shocking statistics emerged over the last couple of years detailing just how big the gap is between the success of the university and the lack of local students attending.\n\nBristol Live revealed the university’s own research had revealed that while 100 per cent of all 18-year-olds living in Clifton went on to university - any university, not just Bristol - just eight per cent of school leavers living in Hartcliffe did.\n\nAnd for most of the years of this decade, the parliamentary constituency of South Bristol was either at the bottom or second from bottom of the league table of school leavers going on to university.\n\nThat meant fewer 18-year-olds went on to higher education from schools in South Bristol than from anywhere else in the country, despite there being a world-class university just across the river.\n\nLast autumn, Bristol University was placed in the bottom ten of all universities in the country in the Sunday Times annual university guide for its social inclusion ranking.\n\nThat looked at the numbers of students from low income families, and found that around a third of all the students attending Bristol Uni had been to a fee-paying private school.\n\nWhat did the survey find?\n\nMyTutor polled adults across Bristol about their experiences of going to school and whether or not they were encouraged to go to university.\n\nThey found more than half of Bristolians - 51 per cent - agreed that during their time at school, they were ‘not encouraged to go into higher education’, and 41 per cent said they didn't have a teacher who encouraged them to pursue higher education.\n\nAround a third - 32 per cent - agreed that they had ‘insufficient access to resources and opportunities whilst at school’.\n\nAnd one in five adults in Bristol - 19 per cent - agreed that ‘through no fault of their own, their parents weren’t able to support them into higher education’.\n\nFour out of five people - 79 per cent - agreed that they did not have access to one-to-one learning at school, and more than a quarter - 27 per cent - agreed that their socio-economic status affected their performance in school.\n\nOne in eight, or 13 per cent, said the quality of the education they received prevented them from reaching their full potential and, as a result, that has held them back in their career.\n\nMore than a quarter, 26 per cent, said they didn't have sufficient access to learning resources, a good standard of teaching and access to opportunities to further their education in the area that they grew up.\n\nLess than a quarter of people in Bristol - 22 per cent - said they had received encouragement to go into a STEM - science, technology, engineering and maths - field.\n\n“With such world-class facilities on the doorstep of the local communities in the city, it begs the question of why so many are being deterred from higher education,” said a spokesperson for MyTutor.\n\n“Despite ranking 10th in the country in the Times' Good University Guide for 2020, the University of Bristol was ranked in the lowest ten universities on the Social Inclusion Ranking, perhaps starting to explain why there is a startling picture of disparities that exist within university cities, such as Bristol,” she added.\n\nThe boss of MyTutor said there was a long history of regional differences in local take up of university places.\n\n“There has been a long history of regional differences, and the government is now looking to address this as part of the recent pledge to \"level up\" Britain,” said Bertie Hubbard.\n\n“There is a real opportunity gap here, and one that technology is well-placed to help close. By empowering schools and parents with more cost-effective and convenient ways to support their children, such as online tutoring, access is no longer such a barrier to success.\"\n\n“As this support structure moves online, these regional divides can be bridged to give every child the opportunity to achieve both in and outside of the classroom, having a positive effect on the rest of their lives,” he added.\n\nBristol Live approached Bristol City Council, which is in charge of secondary education in the city, for a response to the survey's findings. The council declined to comment.\n\nWhat does Bristol University say?\n\nSome 26,000 students attend the University of Bristol each year, a number which is set to rise with the development of the new campus at Temple Quarter.\n\nThe university has run programmes around Bristol since at least 2006 to encourage school pupils to go to uni, but the university itself admits there is much more to be done.\n\nA spokesperson for the University of Bristol said: “As a leading university, we recognise that we have a significant role to play in providing a rich and accessible education for people living in Bristol and the surrounding area.\n\n“We work closely with local schools, colleges and community partners to encourage and inspire local students to attend university, whether that’s here in Bristol or elsewhere.\"\n\nShe added: “While we appreciate that there is still significant work to be done, the University is making real progress and we’re beginning to see our new measures make an impact. In the last four years, we have seen a 92 per cent increase in the number of local people studying here, with 370 new undergraduate students from the local area joining the University in 2019/20.\n\n“This progress is thanks to pioneering schemes such as Bristol Scholars, which was designed to capture the missing talent we know exists in our locality and to demonstrate the University’s commitment to Bristol’s schools and colleges.\n\n“With more local students of all ages applying to study with us year-on-year, we are confident our efforts are beginning to affect real change and we will work hard to ensure this positive trend continues.\"\n\nWhat is Bristol University doing?\n\nBristol Scholars\n\n“This summer, the first cohort of our innovative Bristol Scholars programme graduated from the University. It was introduced in 2017 to support students from the city who have suffered significant levels of educational or social disadvantage and so far we’ve welcomed 300 students to the programme,” said a university spokesperson.\n\n“Participants receive a tailored offer – up to four grades lower than our standard offer – to reflect that a student’s predicted results, or performance in Year 12, may not reflect their true academic ability. They also receive ongoing support in the run up to enrolment, including A-Level tuition from firms including MyTutor, our main virtual provider,” she added.\n\nAccess to Bristol\n\n“We have run Access to Bristol since 2006 and work with more than 900 students from in and around Bristol each year,” the spokesperson said.\n\n“The programme is designed to encourage and inspire pupils who might not otherwise consider going onto higher education. It’s open to anyone studying for A-levels or equivalent at state schools and colleges in and around Bristol.\n\n“Participants gain a unique insight into what it’s like to study at university, try out facilities and work with current students. To date, around 3,500 students have completed the course and over 500 have gone on to study at the University of Bristol.\"\n\nIntoUniversity\n\nThe University of Bristol co-sponsors two IntoUniversity centres in Bristol, one in Easton and one in Withywood.\n\nIt said: “Each centre is a higher education presence in the local community which provides a range of programmes working over the long-term with young people aged seven to 18.\"\n\nFuturequest\n\nThe university said: “We are also a key partner in Futurequest, a collaboration with University West of England and a range of organisations in the city, to encourage students from Bristol to think more positively about higher education.\""
