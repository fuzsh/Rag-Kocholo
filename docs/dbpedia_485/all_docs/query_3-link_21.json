It provides an essential basis for those studying abroad, but will also give those hoping to enter international legal practice a broader understanding of global legal systems. The unit aims to introduce students to the methodologies of comparative law as a discipline as well as to give a basic grounding in common law and civilian legal systems. This will include the historical development of the systems, their structure, the different sources of law and basic distinctions between public and private law, as well as specific topics in these areas. Finally, the unit aims to introduce students to phenomena of legal globalisation and projects involving the harmonisation of laws, as well as enabling them to evaluate such developments.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nBy the end of this unit a successful student will be able to:\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the value of comparative law;\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the differences (and similarities) between common and civil law systems;\n\nAccess and interpret sources of law;\n\nDemonstrate a core understanding of public and private law in common and civil law systems.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a variety of asynchronous and synchronous activities\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\n1 x summative assessment: coursework with a specified word count (100%)\n\nThe assessment will assess all of the intended learning outcomes for this unit.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the Blackboard area for the unit.
