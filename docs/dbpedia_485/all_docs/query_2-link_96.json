        "text": "CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Ohio law enforcement officers may soon have a new tool to detect THC levels in drivers.\n\nRecreational marijuana is legally available in Ohio as of Aug. 6.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are now working on programs to detect THC more quickly in drivers. The test involves swabbing of the mouth on-site instead of sending a suspect to a hospital for a urine or blood test.\n\n“Officers typically will know within 24 hours of not only what kind of drug is in your system, but the actual parent drug,” explained Cincinnati Police FOP president Ken Kober.\n\nKober says saliva testing is better for the officer and better for the suspect.\n\n“It’s a lot less intrusive,” according to Kober. “You know trying to, taking somebody to the hospital to give blood or taking them back to a station and asking them for urine. It’s pretty intrusive. Something like this is just a simple swab and they rub it in your mouth, and they’ve got the results back within 24 hours.”\n\nKober says the saliva tests are currently being used in 24 states and are making their way through the state legislature in Columbus.\n\nState Representative Cecil Thomas voted in favor of the bill to legalize the use of saliva kits, but still has some reservations.\n\n“The saliva kit itself cannot just be the determining factor as to whether you’re impaired,” Thomas says. “It may show that there’s marijuana in your system. Now we all know that marijuana stays in your system a lot longer, up to like 30 days for that matter.”\n\nRep. Thomas says the bill to allow for saliva testing is still working its way through the Senate committee.\n\nHe expects to have it back in the House with some changes before it is voted on and ultimately sent to Gov. Mike DeWine for his signature.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Please click here to report it.\n\nDo you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?
