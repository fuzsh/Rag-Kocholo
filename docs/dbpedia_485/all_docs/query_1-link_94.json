        "text": "A college education is one of the most important investments students and their parents will make – an investment that may affect the direction and quality of the student’s life. Students choose Bryant University because of its excellent reputation and history of successful graduates. Students should select a Bryant education based on academic considerations and not on financial factors, yet many parents and students face challenges in meeting the costs of higher education today. Bryant University is committed to providing excellent value for the educational investment. The following section outlines the tuition and fee structure for the 2024-2025 academic year. These fees are subject to change by the University.\n\nFull-Time Study for Traditional Students\n\nUndergraduate students admitted to a full-time study program will enroll from 12 to 20 credits per regular term with 15 credits being the norm and are required to pay the full-time tuition fee for that term. Students carrying more than 20 credits pay the full-time tuition fee plus a surcharge fee equal to one-twelfth of the full-time regular term tuition fee per credit for each credit over 20.\n\nPart-Time Study for Traditional Students\n\nTraditional undergraduate students who enroll for fewer than 12 credits in a regular term pay a pro rata fee equal to one-twelfth of the full-time term tuition fee per credit.\n\nEnrollment Status Tuition Rates Status Eligible for Housing Financial Aid Status Eligible for laptop Tuition Fee Traditional Status Full-time Yes Federal Eligibility determined when FAFSA completed/Institutional Aid by Financial Aid Yes Traditional Semester fee up to 20 credits Traditional Status Part-time No Not eligible for institutional aid/may be eligible for partial federal aid No Not eligible for institutional aid/may be eligible for partial federal aid Non-traditional Status No Not eligible for institutional aid/may be eligible for partial federal aid No Not eligible for institutional aid/may be eligible for partial federal aid\n\nPart-Time Study for Nontraditional Students\n\nTo study part-time, students must apply to the Admission Office as nontraditional students. Nontraditional students are described as those students whose primary focus is on work and/or family and who pursue their education on a part-time basis. Nontraditional students enroll in fewer than 12 credit hours of study during each regular term and will be charged $3,786.00 per three credit course. To register for more than three courses, nontraditional students must obtain authorization from the Registrar and pay the traditional (full-time) regular term tuition fee. Nontraditional students have up to 12 years to complete their bachelor’s degree requirements and must complete their final 30 credits at Bryant. Nontraditional students may choose day and evening courses.\n\nFull-Time Tuition for Traditional Students\n\nThe full-time tuition fee for the fall and spring terms for all students is $51,780. In addition to tuition, this fee covers all costs associated with attending Bryant, other than room, board and student involvement fee.

Refunds will be calculated as follows:\n\nRoom: No refund (charged by the term). Board: Refund is pro-rated (based on days). Tuition: Written notification received by the Office of the Registrar in the:\n\nRegular Term (Fall/Spring):\n\nRefund Policy week/day percentage Refund Policy Week/Day Percentage First week: 80 percent Second week: 60 percent Third week: 40 percent Fourth week: 20 percent After fourth week: No refund\n\nWinter Term:\n\nRefund Policy week/day percentage Refund Policy Week/Day Percentage First two days: 80 percent After second day: No refund\n\nSummer Day Term:\n\nRefund Policy week/day percentage Refund Policy Week/Day Percentage First two days: 80 percent Day 3-7: 60 percent Day 8-9: 40 percent Day 10-13: 20 percent After day 13: No refund\n\nSummer Evening Term:\n\nRefund Policy week/day percentage Refund Policy Week/Day Percentage First three days: 80 percent Day 4-9: 60 percent Day 10-13: 40 percent Day 14-15: 20 percent After day 15: No refund\n\nStudents who must withdraw due to military requirements will, upon certification of that fact, be granted a 100% refund.\n\nStudents dismissed academically at the end of the first regular term are entitled to a refund of all tuition and room and board fees that have been paid for subsequent terms.\n\nRefund checks or E-Refunds due to students for over payment will be issued upon request and after at least 30 working days following the date a check has been deposited to a student’s account.\n\nA refund check will be made payable to the student (if non-minor) unless the account credit is due to the posting of a PLUS Loan payment. The refund is then processed in the borrower’s name or to the student if written permission by the borrower is provided to the Bursar's Office to release the funds to the student.\n\nReturn of Title IV Federal Financial Aid\n\nRegulatory guidelines associated with the return of Title IV funds as detailed in the Higher Education Amendments of 1965 (as amended in 1998) require institutions participating in federal student aid programs to employ very specific measures in effecting financial aid adjustments for students who withdraw from college. The policy governing the Return of Title IV Federal Financial Aid applies to all federal grant and loan programs (Pell, SEOG, Stafford loans, Grad PLUS and PLUS loans), but does not include the Federal Work-Study Program.\n\nIn general, the law assumes that a student earns federal financial aid awards (which have been approved and verified) in proportion to the number of days completed in the term prior to the student’s complete withdrawal. If a student completely withdraws from school during a term, the school must calculate, according to a specific formula, the portion of the total scheduled financial assistance that the student has earned and is therefore entitled to retain, until the time that the student withdrew.\n\nIf a student receives (or the University receives on the student’s behalf) more assistance than he/she earns, the unearned funds must be returned to the U.S. Department of Education or to the Federal Direct or Federal Parent PLUS Loan programs. If a student’s charges are less than the amount earned, and a refund is due, the student may be able to receive those additional funds. Students who have not completed the verification process are ineligible to receive any financial aid.\n\nThe portion of the federal grants and loans that the student is entitled to receive is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of days in the term to the number of days that the student completed before he/she withdrew. For example, if a student completes 30 percent of the regular term, he/she earns 30 percent of the approved federal aid that he/ she was originally scheduled to receive for the term. This means 70 percent of the student’s scheduled or disbursed aid remains unearned and must be returned to the federal programs. In the past, the previous federal and pro-rata withdrawal policies determined the amount of federal funds that must be returned, and the university was required to reduce the student’s charges by the same amount. The new policy governs the earned and unearned portions of the student’s Federal Title IV Financial Aid only. It determines how much, if any, the student and/or the school may need to return. This policy does not affect the student’s charges. Bryant’s own withdrawal policy will be used to determine the reduction, if any, in the student’s tuition and fee or room and board charges. The student is responsible for paying any outstanding charges to Bryant University.\n\nIf it is determined that a portion of the financial aid received on the student’s behalf is unearned, the University shares, with the student, the responsibility of returning those funds.\n\nAny grant funds that the student is required to return to the federal programs are considered an over payment. The student must either repay the amount in full or make satisfactory payment arrangements with the Department of Education to repay the amount. If the student fails to repay, or make payment arrangements to repay an over payment, the student will lose his/her eligibility to receive future federal financial aid at any institution."
