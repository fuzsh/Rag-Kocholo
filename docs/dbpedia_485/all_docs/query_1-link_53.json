        "text": "Many Canadians choose to study the 2-year Graduate Entry LLB in the UK. On this page, you will learn about this accelerated law program, the benefits of studying law in the UK, entry requirements, how to practice law when you come back to Canada, the costs of the 2-year LLB program, and a lot more.\n\nWhat is a 2-Year Law Degree in the UK?\n\nThe 2-year LLB degree in the UK is an accelerated version of the 3-year Bachelor of Laws degree. Only students that have completed an undergraduate degree can apply to the 2-year LLB Senior Status program. The program is also called an Accelerated LLB or Graduate Entry Law Degree. Completing a UK LLB degree is equivalent to completing a Juris Doctor (JD) degree because it allows you to become a lawyer in Canada. Note that this shortened type of law degree is not offered in Canada.\n\nWhy Do Canadians Choose Graduate Entry LLB Degrees in the UK?\n\nThere are many reasons why so many Canadians choose to study the Senior Status LLB degree in the UK. Below are 7 most common benefits of pursuing this degree:\n\nEntry Requirements for the Accelerated LLB in the UK\n\nThe 2-year Graduate Entry LLB degree requirements are as follows:\n\nA completed undergraduate degree in any subject;\n\nA “B” average in your undergraduate degree;\n\nPersonal statement demonstrating your motivations to study law;\n\nResume/CV with the most up-to-date experience and skills;\n\nReference letter from an academic and/or professional source; and\n\nHigh school and university transcripts.\n\nThe above requirements may vary between universities. For example, some may require a reference letter others won’t. Some may require a video interview, while others don’t.\n\nPractice Law in Canada with a UK Senior Status LLB\n\nAll graduates of the UK’s Senior Status law degree programs are eligible to practice law in Canada. Upon returning to Canada, you will have to undergo the NCA assessment process, where the NCA will assign you, usually 6 accreditation exams, to complete.\n\nYou will generally be assigned the 6 mandatory exams below that cover the core law subjects:\n\nFoundations of Canadian Law\n\nCanadian Criminal Law\n\nCanadian Constitutional Law\n\nCanadian Administrative Law\n\nCanadian Professional Responsibility\n\nLegal Research and Writing\n\nBest UK Law Schools for the Senior Status Law Degree\n\nMany law schools in the UK offer a 2-year Senior Status degree. Almost every university has such a program. Below is a complete list:\n\nCost of a Graduate Entry LLB in the UK\n\nThe tuition fee for international students who study for a 2-year Senior Status degree in the UK is, on average, £18,850 a year. After conversion to Canadian dollars, it is about $30,800 a year. The cost of the degree varies on which university you choose.\n\nFor comparison, the average cost of a law degree in Canada is $20,700 a year. However, in Canada, you have to pay for 3 years of law school, but in the UK, you will only pay for 2 years. This makes a law degree much cheaper in the UK than in Canada. When you consider the cost of living in the UK for 2 years instead of 3 years in Canada, studying law in the UK becomes a much more affordable option.\n\nHow to Apply to 2 Year Bachelor of Law in the UK\n\nThe entire application process is online and very straightforward, with you having to upload the required documents. You have 2 options to apply for a Senior Status LLB degree in the UK:\n\n1 – Apply through UCAS: it stands for Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, which allows you to apply to up to 5 law schools at the same time.\n\n2 – Apply straight to law school: you also have the option to apply directly to your chosen law school. This option tends to be cheaper and faster as well as you will have direct contact with the admissions office, which can be beneficial.\n\nWhen are the Start Dates?\n\nThe Accelerated LLB programs start in September for most universities, but some programs may begin in October. Not many law schools have options to start the 2 year LLB degree in January.\n\nCourse Structure of a 2-Year UK Law Degree\n\nDuring your 2-Year Graduate Entry LLB degree, you will study the following core law subjects:\n\nPublic Law, including Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Human Rights;\n\nLaw of the European Union;\n\nCriminal Law;\n\nObligations including Contract, Restitution, and Tort;\n\nProperty Law; and\n\nEquity and the Law of Trusts.\n\nThe above core subjects are required to be studied in order for your degree to be recognized as a qualifying law degree in the UK, even if you choose the 2-year program. Only qualifying law degrees from the UK are recognized by the NCA in Canada.\n\nIt is likely that during your first year, your studies will focus on the core subjects. Although in your second year, you will continue to study the core law areas, you will generally have at least 2 optional areas of law to study. The elective options can be in any area of law. Here are some examples:\n\nFamily Law\n\nCorporate Law\n\nEnvironmental Law\n\nIntellectual Property Law\n\nInternational Arbitration Law\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About the 2-Year Accelerated Law Degree\n\nWe are often asked many questions about studying the 2-year Senior Status LLB. Below are answers to the most commonly asked questions:\n\nCan I complete LLB in 2 years in the UK?\n\nYes, you can complete an LLB degree in 2 years in the UK if you already have an undergraduate degree. The usual LLB in the UK is 3 years long. However, you can enroll in a 2-year program if you have an undergraduate degree from the UK or another country in any subject.\n\nIs a UK law degree valid and accepted in Canada?\n\nYes, a UK law degree is recognized in Canada. Every UK law graduate must first pass the NCA accreditation process and pass the NCA exams. Then they can go on to fulfill the provincial law society’s requirements to become a lawyer in Canada. In terms of career, many lawyers in Canada have completed a law degree in the UK and practice in Canada. It is widely accepted in most legal markets of the country.\n\nHow long does a law degree take in the UK?\n\nA standard LLB program in the UK takes 3 years to complete for full-time students. However, there are variations in the length of programs, such as part-time LLB programs that take longer than 3 years, or accelerated LLB programs that take 2 years but require a prior undergraduate degree.\n\nCan I do LLB in the UK after graduation?\n\nYes, it is possible to do an LLB in the UK after graduation from another degree program. This is known as a graduate entry LLB program, which is designed for students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree in a subject other than law. Students will generally start researching and applying for these programs in December and January for the intake in the following September.\n\nWhat are the fees for Graduate Entry LLB?"
