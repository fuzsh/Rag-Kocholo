        "text": "Bristol University has told 300 of its students to self-isolate after 40 people contracted coronavirus during an outbreak at a halls of residence.\n\nStudents staying at The Courtrooms accommodation in the centre of the city were told they must \"only socialise with those in their living circle from this afternoon\".\n\nAll 300 residents will now have to self-isolate, remain in their flats and only socialise with those in their living circle from this afternoon, the university officials confirmed.\n\nStudents have been told food supplies and laundry will be delivered straight to their door.\n\nThe university also warned students it would take tough \"action\" against those caught flouting the lockdown rules.\n\nProfessor Sarah Purdy, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Student Experience, said: \"Having reassessed case numbers with colleagues from the Public Health Team today, we have decided that further measures are appropriate at this stage.\"\n\nThe University of Bristol is currently supporting 254 students and three staff members who have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nAll three staff have been working from home and have not been on campus.\n\nProf Purdy added: \"We will do everything we can to support the students at The Courtrooms.\n\n\"If everyone follows the rules, we hope that this situation will pass, and things can return to relative normality as quickly as possible.\n\n\"We have reminded all students that it is vitally important to observe self-isolation requirements in line with both the law and our acceptable behaviour policy.\n\n\"If necessary, the University will take action to ensure students are following this guidance.\""
