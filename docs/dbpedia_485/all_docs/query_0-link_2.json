        "text": "In an evening of celebration and camaraderie, we were honoured to welcome back Dame Victoria Sharp, President of the King’s Bench Division, and Sir Nicholas Mostyn, recently retired High Court judge, who delivered a speech charting the many social and legal changes since the Faculty (as it then was) began life on 6 October 1933.\n\nThe event also celebrated Professor Nigel Furey’s remarkable 50 years of teaching at Bristol. Elizabeth Mumford presented Nigel with a gift on behalf of the School, prompting a richly deserved standing ovation from all attending.\n\nProfessor Oliver Quick, School International Director, said:\n\n“Celebrating 90 years has been a powerful reminder of the respect and affection that our alumni have for our School. Marking this milestone with over 300 alumni in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bristol has been highly memorable. We are hugely grateful for the many ways our alumni continue to support the School and our students, and we look forward to celebrating the Centenary in 2033.”\n\nProfessor Catherine Kelly, Head of School, said:"
