        "text": "myCTState\n\nMyCTState is the student portal that you will use throughout your time at CT State Community College. Among other things, you will use this site to register for courses, make tuition payments, and access any online course material. In addition, you must have myCTState access in order to complete your placement testing. Students who do not have US Social Security Numbers need to request temporary passwords in order to access myCTState. Contact the International Student Team to learn about the process for your campus.\n\nPlacement Testing\n\nWe cannot place students into classes based on foreign high school transcripts or English proficiency test scores. Placement testing will be required before course registration unless you are transferring from another US college and provide a transcript. Contact the International Student Team for testing protocols on your campus. Pre-arrival virtual placement testing MAY be an option in some cases.\n\nAcademic Advising\n\nNew students may not register themselves for classes. All students are provided personalized assistance in choosing their classes. Suggestions are based on both placement test results and the curriculum for your degree program. Information about academic advising will be provided in your acceptance email. You can also contact the International Advising team for more information.\n\nTuition Payments\n\nAt least a partial tuition payment is required at the time of course registration. A payment plan is available, which you can request via myCTState or from your campus Bursar/Cashier’s office. Students who do not make an initial payment may be dropped from their classes.\n\nForeign Transfer Credits\n\nIf you would like to receive transfer credit for any college-level work completed outside of the US, you must get your foreign transcript evaluated and submit a “course-by-course” evaluation report. We can accept an evaluation from any company that is accredited by NACES (www.naces.org) or AICE (https://aice-eval.org/).\n\nWhile studying in the United States, you must maintain your F-1 status. F-1 status means that the purpose of your being in the United States is to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means:\n\nFulfilling the purpose for receiving an F-1 visa.\n\nFollowing the regulations associated with that purpose.\n\nBelow are the requirements for maintaining your F-1 status.\n\nEnrollment\n\nAttend all your classes and maintain normal academic progress. If school is too difficult, speak with your DSO and academic advisor immediately.\n\nMaintain a full course of study every Fall and Spring semester: 12 credits minimum. Only 3 credits can be taken online, the rest must be taken in person. Under the current SEVP guidance, more than half of the credits must be offered through the home campus (the campus reflected on your Form I-20). If you cannot study full time, contact your DSO immediately. You may be eligible for an RCL (reduced course load) in limited circumstances. Summer enrollment is optional.\n\nSpeak to your International Student Advisor/DSO before dropping a class.\n\nTalk to your International Student Advisor/DSO about requesting a possible program extension if you do not think you will complete your program of study by the end date listed on your Form I-20. An extension must be requested before your program end date.\n\nWork and Practical Training\n\nAs an F-1 student you may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases and USCIS in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to reenter the United States at a later date.\n\nF-1 students are eligible for curricular practical training (CPT) during the program of study. CPT employment must be an integral part of an established curriculum and the position must directly relate to your major area of study. Your DSO can give you the school’s policy on this option.\n\nF-1 students are also eligible for optional practical training (OPT) during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study.\n\nFor more information about employment and training options available for F-1 students, see employment section below or visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO.\n\nProgram Completion\n\nOnce you complete your program of study and any authorized period of practical training, you have 60 days from the program end date on your Form I-20 to leave the United States. If you wish to extend your stay in the United States, talk with your DSO to learn more about the following options:\n\nTransferring to another school.\n\nEnrolling in another program at CT State.\n\nApplying for OPT.\n\nApplying to USCIS for a change to another visa status.\n\nIf you fail to maintain your F-1 student status, you may choose one of two ways to regain it: applying for reinstatement or leaving the US and seeking a new admission to the US in F-1 status.\n\nThe process to regain valid F-1 status can be challenging. You should meet with your DSO and discuss your options. We also encourage you to contact an immigration attorney so you can make an informed decision and consider the risks with both options.\n\nOption 1: Reinstatement\n\nWhen requesting reinstatement, you must establish to the satisfaction of USCIS that you:\n\nHave not been out of status more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrate that the failure to file within the 5-month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that you filed for reinstatement as soon as possible under these circumstances).\n\nDo not have a record of repeated or willful violations of immigration regulations.\n\nAre currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of study in the immediate future at CT State.\n\nHave not engaged in unauthorized employment.\n\nAre not deportable on any ground other than overstaying or failing to maintain status.\n\nYou must also establish that:\n\nThe violation of status was caused by circumstances beyond your control.\n\nYou fell below a full course load for a reason the DSO could have used to authorize a reduced course load, and you would experience extreme hardship if you fail to get reinstatement.\n\nIf USCIS approves the reinstatement request, the adjudicating officer will update your SEVIS record to indicate that you have been reinstated. If USCIS does not approve the reinstatement request, you may not appeal the decision and need to prepare to leave the US immediately.\n\nFor Reinstatement Application procedures please contact your DSO as soon as possible.\n\nOption 2: Travel and Reentry\n\nIn some cases, it may be advisable to leave the US and reenter with a new I-20, rather than apply for reinstatement. You may do this by obtaining a new I-20 from CT State, paying another I-901 SEVIS fee, then departing the US, applying for a new F-1 visa if the F-1 visa stamp in your passport has expired, and returning to the US.\n\nTo request a new I-20 for travel and reentry please contact your DSO as soon as possible.\n\nWhile in F-1 status, you may be able to travel during your time of study. If you travel internationally, for summer vacation or during a school break, make sure you take the appropriate steps before you travel to ensure a smooth reentry into the United States.\n\nMeet with your International Student Advisor/DSO\n\nBefore you travel abroad, it is important to check in with your DSO. When you meet with your DSO, you should ensure that your record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is up-to-date and in Active status.\n\nMake sure that your DSO has signed your Form I-20 within the last year, and that you are not leaving the country for more than 5 months. You should also make sure that you have your DSO’s most up-to-date contact information.\n\nIf you have a pending practical training (OPT) application, it is not recommended that you leave the United States. USCIS may send you a request for evidence while you are traveling, and you are expected to be able to send in the requested documents. USCIS will only send the requests to your US address.\n\nIf/when USCIS approves your practical training (OPT) application, you will receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which USCIS will only send to your US address. You are expected to have your EAD in hand to reenter the United States. Visit the Travel page on ICE.gov/SEVP for more information about traveling with pending applications.\n\nWhat to Bring to US Ports of Entry\n\nWhen you enter the United States, you will arrive at a port of entry and meet with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers for primary and sometimes a secondary inspection.\n\nThe CBP officer may ask questions about your reason for travel and inspect the following important documents:\n\nStudent visa\n\nForm I-20\n\nPassport\n\nForm I-901 (SEVIS Fee) Receipt\n\nMost recent transcripts or proof of course registration for next semester\n\nYour/your sponsors financial documents\n\nYour passport must be valid for at least six months after the date of your reentry. Be sure to hand-carry all of these items and do not put them in your checked baggage. You do not need to repay the I-901 SEVIS Fee to reenter the United States.\n\nForm I-515A\n\nIf you arrive at a US port of entry and do not have all your signed required documents, have not paid the I-901 SEVIS Fee on your current Form I-20 or have a SEVIS status issue, a CBP officer may issue you a Form I-515A, “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor.” The Form I-515A admits you to the United States for 30 days while you obtain and submit the proper documentation to SEVP.\n\nIf you are issued a Form I-515A at a US port of entry, talk to your DSO and visit the Form I-515A Overview page for instructions.\n\nAs an F-1 student, you may be eligible to transfer to a new school. To be eligible to transfer, you must consistently maintain your F-1 status and follow the correct transfer procedures. To maintain your status at your current school, you must continue attending all of your classes until the transfer release date. Your transfer release date is the day on which the DSO at your current school releases your I-20 and moves responsibility for your SEVIS record to your new school.\n\nIf your DSO believes you may not have maintained your F-1 status, your SEVIS record could be in Terminated status, which is the DSO’s way of reporting a concern to SEVP. You may still be able to transfer in Terminated status. Talk to your current DSO and a DSO at the new school if you want to transfer with a terminated record.\n\nIf you have employment authorization and are in the process of transferring to a new school, talk to your current DSO about how your transfer will affect your employment authorization. You may continue authorized work at your current school until the transfer release date in SEVIS, but all work authorization ends after that date. After you transfer to your new school, talk to your DSO about employment options at that school.\n\nTo start the process of transferring, you need to bring/send the following to your DSO:\n\nWritten confirmation of acceptance to another SEVP-certified school\n\nContact information for the new school’s DSO\n\nSEVIS school code for the transfer-in school\n\nYour DSO will then work with you, and the DSO at your new school, to choose a transfer release date. This date is when the DSO at your transfer-in school takes responsibility for your SEVIS record.\n\nFactors going into selecting this date are:\n\nAcademic needs\n\nTravel and employment plans\n\nProjected start date of your new program\n\nOnce your transfer release date arrives, the DSO at your previous school will not have access to your SEVIS record, and your new DSO can create a new Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status,” for you. It is important to get a new Form I-20 (signed by your new DSO and you) as soon as possible. To maintain your status, register for classes right away and contact your new DSO within 15 days of the program start date listed on your new Form I-20.\n\nIf you have arrived in the United States but want to transfer to a new school before you begin classes at the school listed on your Form I-20, talk to the DSO at the school listed on that form. You need to inform the DSO that you have arrived in the United States and want to transfer immediately to another SEVP-certified school. You need to show proof of acceptance to your new school. You must report to your new school and enroll in a full course of study within 30 days of arriving in the United States.\n\nThere are several options for F-1 visa international students who wish to work while in school.\n\nOn campus\n\nLegally, F-1 visa international students are allowed to work on-campus up to 20 hours/week while school is in session, and full-time during school vacations. However, the reality is that there are very few job opportunities on most CT State campuses. Check with your DSO to learn about the hiring protocols and job search processes for your campus. Be aware that “work study” jobs are only for US students with approved financial aid; international students are limited to “student assistant” or “student laborer” positions.\n\nOptional Practical Training\n\nOptional Practical Training (known as OPT) is the most commonly used type of work authorization among F-1 visa students. It is an off-campus work permit designed to provide students with work experience in their major field of study. Students approved for OPT are only allowed to pursue employment that is directly related to their field of study, as noted on the Form I-20.\n\nInternational students may apply to use Optional Practical Training during school vacations (part-time or full-time), while school is in session (part-time only), or after graduation (full-time only). A part-time work authorization allows up to 20 hours/week. A full-time work authorization allows you to work full time.\n\nF-1 visa students are eligible for only 12 months of full-time OPT per degree level completed. Any OPT that you use during your academic program will mean a shorter period of employment authorization after you graduate. Part-time OPT is counted at half the rate of full-time OPT. For example, one year of part-time OPT is equivalent to 6 months of full-time OPT. In deciding whether or not to apply for Optional Practical Training during your academic program, you should consider whether or not you plan to transfer out or return home immediately after graduation. Contact your DSO to discuss your options.\n\nOptional Practical Training is authorized by USCIS for periods of up to one year. The application costs $410 and can take up to 90 days to process. No job offer is required at the time of application. However, as part of your OPT application, action by the International Student Advisor/DSO is required in SEVIS. DO NOT apply for Optional Practical Training without consulting your DSO.\n\nYou may not begin working until your OPT has been approved, your work authorization card has been received, and the start date printed on the card has been reached.\n\nNOTE: Authorizations for Post-Completion Optional Practical Training must be utilized (even on a part-time or unpaid basis), and employment information must be recorded in your SEVIS record. It is unlawful to accrue more than 90 days of unemployment while on Post-Completion Optional Practical Training.\n\nCurricular Practical Training\n\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT) is for students who are required OR allowed to pursue a for-credit internship as part of their academic program. Credits must appear on the transcript and must be applied in some way towards a student’s graduation requirements. Only courses that clearly require field work or employment (as per the course title and/or course description) can be used for Curricular Practical Training purposes. The employment should be completed in the same semester in which you register for the course.\n\nAcademic internships are often unpaid. But if there is any chance that you will receive some kind of compensation for your work, you should obtain Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization in order to avoid potential illegal employment. CPT is authorized by the International Student Advisor/DSO for a particular semester and employer, and the authorization is noted in your SEVIS record. There is no fee to apply.\n\nWork Permission Based on Severe Economic Hardship\n\nThis type of work authorization is designed for students who are experiencing economic hardship that is both unexpected and beyond their control. In making an application to USCIS, a student must explain the nature of their financial difficulties AND attach evidence to verify those claims. Unlike OPT, this type of work permission is not always granted, and can be difficult to secure. But if approved, it is a very versatile type of work authorization. It allows a student to work in any type of employment up to 20 hours/week while school is in session AND full-time during school vacations.\n\nWork Permission Based on Severe Economic Hardship is authorized by USCIS for periods of up to one year, not to extend beyond the expiration date on the Form I-20 or your transfer to another college. The application costs $410 and often takes up to 90 days to process. As with OPT, action by the International Student Advisor/DSO is required in SEVIS as part of your application to USCIS. DO NOT apply for off-campus work permission without consulting your DSO.\n\nYou may not begin working until your application has been approved, your work authorization card has been received, and the start date printed on the card has been reached."
