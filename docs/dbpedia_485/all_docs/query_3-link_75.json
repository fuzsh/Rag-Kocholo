Colleges also ask for financial guarantees.\n\nTuition fees\n\nTuition fees for international students depend on the course you’re studying (see table below). Please note:\n\nfees listed are per year and are fixed for the duration of the course\n\nfor international students undertaking a year abroad, the tuition fee payable to the University of Cambridge during the year abroad will be 50% of the full fee\n\nfor international students taking Veterinary Medicine, the tuition fee payable in Year 3 will be the tuition fee for the course taken in that year – see the course page for details\n\nInternational tuition fees for 2024 entry\n\nGroup Courses Tuition Fee\n\nCollege fees\n\nAll international/overseas fee status students, and those Home fee status students who aren't eligible for tuition fee support (eg affiliated students), normally have to pay an annual College fee in addition to University tuition fees. This covers the cost to your College of providing a range of educational, domestic and pastoral services and support.\n\nCollege fees may vary between Colleges and in many cases are fixed for the duration of your course. College fees for 2024-25 are published in the following document: Undergraduate tuition fees 2024-25.\n\nLiving costs\n\nYour living expenses may be higher than for a UK student, for example if you stay in Cambridge/the UK during vacations. In 2025-26, the minimum resources needed in Cambridge for a full 12 months (excluding tuition and College fees) are estimated to be approximately £14,880, depending on lifestyle. We've rounded this figure up to the nearest £10. You should be aware that because maintenance rates are set more than a year in advance based on inflation rates at the time, the cost of living may have risen before you arrive in Cambridge.\n\nThese costs were calculated in May 2024 according to the Bank of England inflation forecast at that time. They are intended to be indicative and are reviewed in the November following the original calculation. New students should also allow for settling-in costs, including visas, travel and equipment. Further guidance is available on the International Student Office website.\n\nPlease note that all students are ordinarily expected to live and study in Cambridge during term time for the full duration of their course (with the exception of the year abroad where part of the course).\n\n--\n\n*Figure rounded up to the nearest £10."
