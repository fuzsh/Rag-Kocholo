Whether itâ€™s the low student-to-faculty ratio, high bar passage and employment rates, stellar placement in federal clerkships, opportunities in public interest and public service, numerous advocacy teams and journals, clinical experiences, or international programs, the list of wonderful things happening at our law school seems to never end.
