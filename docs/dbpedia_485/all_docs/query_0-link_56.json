        "text": "That's a tough one. Yes they can get jobs but I can see why you're worried. I would look at typical student accommodation available & see how much it costs to get a general idea (sorry I don't live in Bristol but I get the impression it's sort of pricey). Also I take it commuting isn't a possibility?\n\nThis is it - to even meet my basic obligations it will be 11k per year and I’m only just learning that accommodation eats almost all of it. Even if I manage to get to the max loan amount they’ll be living on thin air. I hadn’t clocked how expensive Bristol would be to live in. I can’t ask them to study elsewhere when it was my fault I’d not clocked how the parental contributions worked - I genuinely thought I had enough and then some. All my own fault and I’ll have to suck it up.\n\nNative here. Bristol is very expensive to live in and has an extremely competitive rental market. It's difficult to come up with a figure as places are often rented for more than they're advertised at as people get into a bidding war over them. Bristol is running out of areas that are affordable-ish to live in. But if they can live frugally (no car, not eat out much, large flat share, live further out of town) they may be ok. Or, I know quite a lot of late 20/30-somethings in Bristol who have got on to the house ladder but rent out a room in their house for a bit of extra income. If your girls would be interested in lodging rather than a student house share that might be one of the most cost effective options as all bills tend to be included and at least you know the house is well looked after as the landlord lives there too. The downside being they won't get the typical student experience (over-rated IMO).\n\nAt least they are both going to study for a qualification leading to a potentially lucrative career so it sort of feels worth stretching for as it won't be an obvious waste like some courses.\n\nNo that’s literally the point.\n\nThe cut off is so ridiculously low (I think it’s 40k household income? That’s 2 x min wage jobs).\n\nWe have a fairly healthy household income but we didn’t have for years so no uni savings and with the COL now we certainly can’t afford the £600pm suggested parental contribution. DS is in his third year and has had a total of about £500 from us in total. He’s worked all the way through.\n\nfirstly congratulations on your amazing DCs!\n\nI think you’ll be ok for two years. I’ve got one in Bristol- he lives off the minimum maintenance loan which is fine, I pay his rent (£600 a month) and occasionally top up bills etc.\n\nhe now has a part time job which he mainly saves for festivals etc and spends on nights out. But he could contribute £100 a month from his loan towards rent I guess.\n\nmy mum is great for sending emergency tesco deliveries/trainers/alcohol money!\n\ncan you save another £10 to £12 k over the next two years?\n\nI really do feel for parents and young people planning for uni these days. If my parents had to make a £600pm contribution there is now way I would have been able to go to uni. I would not be allowed to be in the job I'm in now without my degree. I was lucky that fees back then were approx £1k. My parents earnings were low enough that I didn't even pay that, but I could have stretched to it if I'd needed to. And the student loan more than covered my super cheap rent and food. I worked full time in the holidays to earn my 'having fun' money. I can't even being to imagine the financial burden of uni now. So, I feel your pain OP, it's not a nice position to be in.\n\nIf you look at the Bristol uni accommodation fees, some are cheaper than others. If your accommodation is £5k or £6k a year that makes quite a difference to £8k or £9k a year. https://www.bristol.ac.uk/accommodation/about/costs/cost-by-residence/\n\nDo you know how many contact hours a week there are on the course? That can affect how easy it is to get a part time job during the year. Ideally you try to find something where you can work full time during the holidays and part time during term time.\n\nThanks! I’m stunned by them myself - they get none of it from me, my dad is an engineer and their shared passion for planes and formula one is totally alien to me. It’s a vocation it would seem.\n\nWe will find the money over the 4 years, it’s just about doable, but we’re not high earners, just have been quite comfortable on A household income of 67k - looks like we’ll be living on student rations ourselves, but that’s ok. I stupidly thought the living loan was enough to live on and I was topping up to make life comfortable - I wish someone had sent me a letter around year 7 telling me how it worked! So stupid of me."
