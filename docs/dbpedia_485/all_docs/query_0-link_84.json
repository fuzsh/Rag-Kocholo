        "text": "Grant Shapps has criticised the “absurd” decision by Bristol University’s Student Union to ban the Army from its freshers’ fair.\n\nThe Officers’ Training Corps [OTC], which provides military training units for university students to join alongside their studies, was prevented from displaying at the Bristol fair on Friday.\n\nBristol’s Student’s Union (SU) said it made the decision to ban the group because it would “compete” with other “affiliated” organisations who have been allowed into the event.\n\nHowever, the Defence Secretary accused the SU of the leading Russell Group institution of “depriving” students of opportunities to enrol in the OTC and explore a career in the Army.\n\nMr Shapps said: “Reported bans on officer training corps and defence companies attending university events like freshers’ fairs or recruitment fairs are absurd and indefensible.\n\n“University OTC’s provide students with a unique opportunity to gain new experiences, develop valuable skills and have amazing adventures.”\n\nMr Shapps added that the defence industry was “crucial to protecting our freedom”, as well as the “prosperity and way of life”, all the while “offering graduates a chance to take on some of the most highly skilled jobs in the world”.\n\n“Trying to deprive students of these opportunities is wrong and anyone considering doing so should reconsider immediately,” he said.\n\n‘Anti-military views’\n\nDefence sources told The Telegraph it was not “unprecedented” for the OTC, of which there are 21 university OTCs in the UK, to be prevented from attending a freshers fair.\n\n“Student unions tend to be quite Left-wing liberal, so OTCs aren’t always popular with the majority of the student body,” they said.\n\n“They have been known to be banned by student unions over the years. It’s not without precedent.”\n\nHowever, they cautioned that OTCs, which are part of the British Army Reserves, are not set up as “feeders” for the regular Armed Forces, and were more of a fun, “social scene” where students can try out new sports and enjoy adventure training.\n\n“Lots don’t go into the military at all,” they added.\n\nOn its website, the SU said the Welcome Fair will be the “biggest event of the year”, with over 13,000 students and more than 300 student groups with stalls hoping to sign up new members.\n\nAbby Blackwell, a 21-year-old Bristol OTC member, said she was “disappointed” the group has been banned.\n\n“The Students’ Union claims to be a place of open-mindedness and inclusivity but it’s not. They’re imposing their anti-military views on their students,” she said.\n\n“The university is supposed to help us find fulfilling and lifelong careers, but by trying to ban the OTC they’re doing the opposite of that. They’re limiting potential career paths.\n\n“Talented individuals who may have loved a career in the Army might not have one now.”\n\nDisciplining feminists\n\nAn SU spokesperson said: “Bristol SU Welcome Fair is an event run and curated by Bristol SU to help build peer-led communities whilst at university.\n\n“It’s primarily an opportunity for our 350+ affiliated student groups to attract new student members, and we also host approximately 90 commercial stalls.\n\n“We assess requests made by unaffiliated groups on a case-by-case basis, considering a number of factors which have been communicated to the OTC, including that groups like the OTC offer an experience (such as making friends, developing leadership skills and adventure activities) which is very similar to, and therefore in direct competition with, our affiliated student groups.”\n\nIn February this year, Bristol SU passed a motion to lobby the university to “end ties with arms trade companies”.\n\nThat same month, the SU caused anger by disciplining Women Talk Back (WTB), its own feminist group, for excluding male-born trans women from talks on rape and sexual assault.\n\nA spokesperson for Bristol University said: “We respect our students’ right to raise concerns about issues they feel strongly about and we will continue to listen to and engage with their views.”"
