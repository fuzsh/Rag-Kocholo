        "text": "The state of the art building for Bristol Business School (BBS) and Bristol Law School (BLS) has opened at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol), sitting pride of place next to the recently completed Students’ Union.\n\nDesigned to foster interaction between businesses, the building is a jewel in the crown of a significant £300m capital investment programme across all campuses. It will enable UWE Bristol to offer a new way forward in Business and Law education for students and businesses in the region.\n\nThe atrium of #BristolBusinessSchool at @uwebristol looking very Tron.\n\nA post shared by Stride Treglown (@stridetreglown) on May 15, 2017 at 9:29am PDT\n\nKey professional organisations will have a base in the new building, with barristers, accountants, small business owners and start-ups mixing with staff and students in the learning and social areas. Throughout the building there are flexible workspaces that staff, students and visitors can use.\n\nFeatures also include two showcase law courts, a city trading room, a 300 seat lecture theatre, two Harvard lecture theatres, an incubator for the Team Entrepreneurs, technology enhanced and flexible learning spaces, IT suites, meeting facilities and parking for business, an external business engagement space, a central social space and a café.\n\nUp at @uwebristol getting some shots with @tombright_. Flooded with natural light, the atrium space is perfect for meeting, eating, working and socialising.\n\nA post shared by Stride Treglown (@stridetreglown) on May 8, 2017 at 7:40am PDT\n\nDonna Whitehead, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Executive Dean of BBS and BLS says:\n\n“This will be a live environment where staff and students and business work together – with collaboration at its core.\n\n“We consult with our advisory board of key business figures who challenge us to make our provision meet the needs of employers and the latest developments in the business world.”\n\nRead the full Bristol Business School case study.\n\nPhotographs courtesy of Cora Kwiatkowski."
