        "text": "Learn from world-leading academics so you can become an expert yourself\n\nOur intellectually demanding, research-informed curriculum is delivered by academics who are leaders in their fields. As a Russell Group university, and a top 3 UK law school for legal research excellence (REF2021), our academics are leading the way in diverse areas of legal research. It is this combination of teaching and research excellence that sees our graduates stand out - going on to shape and inform policy and legislation around the world and across many sectors.\n\nChoose from a diverse range of LLMs and units\n\nThe knowledge and expertise of our academics informs our distinctive and exciting range of LLMs with programmes including the LLM International Law, LLM Banking and Finance, LLM Health, Law and Society, LLM in Human Rights Law, LLM in Employment, Work and Equality and many more to choose from. The pioneering research of our academics has also influenced a diverse range of optional modules that enable you to tailor your own degree.\n\nExciting opportunities for non-law graduates\n\nOur MA in Law is an accelerated, senior status postgraduate degree. This law course will enable you to graduate in two years versus three with an LLB â€“ and with a deeper understanding of law and legal reasoning than is possible with a one-year programme. On this course you will also have the chance for specialist study with optional units that reflect the expertise of our academics - setting it apart in terms of helping you achieve the highest aspirations you have for your future career.\n\nThe Faculty of Arts, Social Sciences and Law embodies a vibrant global community of world-class expertise in economics, education, finance, human geography, international studies, law, management, politics, social policy, social work and sociology, attracting talented staff and students from around the world and forging strong links with international organisations and research councils.\n\nLive and learn in great facilities, an exciting UK city and one of the largest legal centres outside of London\n\nThe Law School facilities provide the very best blend of tradition and innovation. Much of the teaching is based in the iconic Wills Memorial Building at the heart of Bristol, with its gothic tower, Great Hall and library - and gargoyle framed windows of its lecture halls. Across the road in Berkeley Square is another historic building, refurbished to house modern research suites, seminar and tutor rooms and a state-of-the-art moot court where you can also test out your debating and negotiating skills. Bristol itself is a vibrant, culturally diverse city, small enough to feel warm and friendly, but big enough to provide outstanding extracurricular opportunities, including a host of clubs, sporting activities and community and volunteering groups.\n\nOur careers programme\n\nGain the skills and knowledge to access a diverse range of careers\n\nChoosing the University of Bristol means gaining access to a rich calendar of career-focused activities and a strong collaboration between the School, our alumni, international law firms, non-governmental organisations and a dedicated careers adviser with expertise in what is needed to access diverse legal pathways. Studying at the University of Bristol Law School means graduating with the skills, knowledge and contacts to fulfil your career aspirations and excel in or out of law.\n\nGet hands on clinical legal experience and work opportunities in human rights, legal tech and criminology\n\nThrough our student-run pro bono legal service, the Human Rights Law Clinic and initiatives that tackle criminal law and the justice system, such as the Freedom Law Clinic, you can gain recognised, real-life experience of law that employers in a wide range of sectors will value. Further opportunities include mentoring schemes, human rights and much more."
