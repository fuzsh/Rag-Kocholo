        "text": "Law is a global profession. An understanding of more than one legal system, language and culture can open up a world of opportunity.\n\nThe course is structured to help you think, write, reason and argue like an international lawyer while gaining a rich understanding of language, literature, history and culture of the Spanish-speaking world. It will also help you develop key skills in research and analysis.\n\nOur exciting range of optional units will help you specialise during your degree. Many law and language students choose options suited to global law firms and international businesses, such as human rights, environment or technology law - subjects that can open doors to top-flight careers the world over.\n\nOptional units in your second and fourth years provide the flexibility to focus on what interests you most about the Spanish-speaking world, its cultures and impact on the wider world. You will also further develop your linguistic skills.\n\nTypically, you will spend your third year abroad studying units in Spanish law taught in Spanish.\n\nThe final year of your Bristol degree includes further optional units to support your professional aspirations, and your final-year dissertation allows you to engage critically with your chosen topic. Our wide range of specialist units span banking and finance, international and commercial law, criminology, IT, environment, health and human rights law.\n\nA broader cultural experience, advanced language skills and the ability to articulate both the distinctive and common features of different legal systems will see you graduate with a valuable skill set, ideally tailored to the globalised workplace.\n\nIn combination with Law, Spanish is only available at post-A level (or equivalent)."
