        "text": "Bristol Community College is excited to announce that, with the passing of the 2023/2024 state budget and subject to state appropriation, MassReconnect will officially launch at the college for the upcoming Fall 2023 semester, beginning September 5.\n\nMassReconnect will cover the cost of community college for Massachusetts residents 25 or older without a previous college degree and bring higher education within reach for adult learners in our region. The program is available to new and current Bristol students.\n\n“While Bristol Community College has so much to offer adult learners, with specialized resources to help them learn, grow and succeed – students still often face financial struggles. The life-changing MassReconnect opportunity will relieve the financial burden of college expenses so that students can make college possible,” said Dr. Laura L. Douglas, President, Bristol Community College.\n\nBristol’s enrollment staff has been working diligently to prepare for the implementation of MassReconnect. The college’s Admissions, Financial Aid, Testing, and Advising teams are ready to assist students through the enrollment process quickly, so they can utilize MassReconnect as soon as possible.\n\nThere are three main requirements and steps students can take to prepare for MassReconnect eligibility. As a last-dollar-in program, MassReconnect requires that students complete their FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Students must also be admitted to a certificate or degree program and registered for six or more credits. Bristol's financial aid, admissions and advising staff is available to assist students and their families complete these important steps. August is the peak processing time for enrollment, so it is important for students to get their FAFSA in now to ensure their plans are solidified in time for the start of classes.\n\nMassReconnect aligns with Bristol Community College’s Strategic Plan, which outlines goals in increasing educational attainment of adult learners to support a talent pipeline in our region. The average age of a Bristol student is 25 years old. Approximately 40% of students in the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters were adult students."
