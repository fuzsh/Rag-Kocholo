The DOI accepts into its public land inventory lands that were once used by the military services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) that may contain munitions or explosives. These lands, which comprise millions of acres that are accessible to the public, pose special land-management challenges, which is why the DOI and its bureaus and agencies collaborates with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to handle ordnance-related concerns.

The Federal agencies responsible for administration of the Federal lands, and DOI, as the department of jurisdiction, work with the military services to limit exposure to Munitions and Explosives of Concern for the public and employees. DOI bureaus and agencies have been delegated the Comprehensive, Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) response authorities on lands subject to its jurisdiction, custody, or control under Executive Order 12580.

DOI coordinates with its partners to develop general principles and consensus approaches to the investigation and cleanup of such lands, consistent with existing law.

This collaboration extends to the possible transfer of additional military lands to the DOI agencies.
