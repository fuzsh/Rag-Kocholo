        "text": "Territory that does not possess full political independence as a sovereign state\n\nThis article is about external territories which have a greater degree of autonomy from their parent state and function as de facto independent political entities. For subnational administrative divisions which have some degree of autonomy under the national government, see Autonomous administrative division.\n\nA dependent territory, dependent area, or dependency (sometimes referred as an external territory) is a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state and remains politically outside the controlling state's integral area. As such, a dependent territory includes a range of non-integrated not fully to non-independent territory types, from associated states to non-self-governing territories (e.g. a colony).\n\nA dependent territory is commonly distinguished from a country subdivision by being considered not to be a constituent part of a sovereign state. An administrative subdivision, instead, is understood to be a division of a state proper. A dependent territory, conversely, often maintains a great degree of autonomy from its controlling state. Historically, most colonies were considered to be dependent territories. Not all autonomous entities, though, are considered to be dependent territories.[1][failed verification] Most inhabited, dependent territories have their own ISO 3166 country codes.\n\nSome political entities inhabit a special position guaranteed by an international treaty or another agreement, thereby creating a certain level of autonomy (e.g. a difference in immigration rules). Those entities are sometimes considered to be, or are at least grouped with, dependent territories,[2] but are officially considered by their governing states to be an integral part of those states.[2] Such an example is Åland, an autonomous region of Finland.\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe lists below include the following:\n\nDependent territories\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo states in free association, one dependent territory, and one Antarctic claim in the listing for New Zealand\n\nOne uninhabited territory and two Antarctic claims in the listing for Norway\n\n13 overseas territories (ten autonomous, two used primarily as military bases, and one uninhabited), three Crown dependencies, and one Antarctic claim in the listing for the United Kingdom\n\n13 unincorporated territories (five inhabited and eight uninhabited) and two claimed but uncontrolled territories in the listing for the United States\n\nSimilar entities\n\n[edit]\n\nSix external territories (three inhabited and three uninhabited) and one Antarctic claim in the listing for Australia\n\nTwo special administrative regions in the listing for China\n\nTwo self-governing territories with autonomy in internal affairs in the listing for Denmark\n\nOne autonomous region governed according to an act and international treaties in the listing for Finland\n\nFive autonomous overseas collectivities, one sui generis collectivity, and two uninhabited overseas territories (one of which includes an Antarctic claim) in the listing for France\n\nThree constituent countries with autonomy in internal affairs in the listing for the Netherlands\n\nOne internal territory with limited sovereignty in the listing for Norway\n\nLists of dependent territories\n\n[edit]\n\nThis list includes all territories that have not been legally incorporated into their governing state, including several territories that are not on the list of non-self-governing territories of the General Assembly of the United Nations.[3] All claims in Antarctica are listed in italics.\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Realm of New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand has two self-governing associated states, one dependent territory, and a territorial claim in Antarctica.[4][better source needed]\n\nAssociated state Administration ISO 3166 country code Cook Islands Self-governing state in free association with New Zealand since 1965. Cook Islands' status is considered to be equivalent to independence for international law purposes, and the country exercises full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.[5] Under the terms of the free association agreement, however, New Zealand retains some responsibility for the foreign relations and defence of the Cook Islands. These responsibilities confer no rights of control and are exercised only at the request of the Cook Islands Government. The government of New Zealand does not consider it appropriate for the Cook Islands to have a separate seat at the United Nations, due to its continued use of the right of Cook Islanders to have New Zealand citizenship.[6] CK Niue Self-governing state in free association with New Zealand since 1974. Niue's status is considered to be equivalent to independence for international law purposes, and the country exercises full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs.[5] Under the terms of the free association agreement, however, New Zealand retains some responsibility for the foreign relations and defence of Niue. These responsibilities confer no rights of control and are exercised only at the request of the Government of Niue. The government of New Zealand does not consider it appropriate for the Niue to have a separate seat at the United Nations, due to its continued use of the right of Niueans to have New Zealand citizenship.[6] NU Dependent territory Administration ISO 3166 country code Tokelau Territory of New Zealand.

A claim by Nicaragua was resolved in 2012 in favor of Colombia by the International Court of Justice (the U.S. is not a party nor recognises the court's jurisdiction).\n\nLists of similar entities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following entities are, according to the law of their state, integral parts of the state but exhibit many characteristics of dependent territories. This list is generally limited to entities that are either subject to an international treaty on their status, uninhabited, or have a unique level of autonomy and are largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. It generally does not include entities with no unique autonomy, such as the five overseas departments and regions (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) of France; the BES islands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba) of the Netherlands; Jan Mayen of Norway; and Palmyra Atoll of the United States. However, Svalbard of Norway is included, as it has some restrictions according to Svalbard Treaty, despite not having autonomy. Entities with only limited unique autonomy, such as Barbuda of Antigua and Barbuda; Sabah and Sarawak of Malaysia; the two autonomous regions (the Azores and Madeira) of Portugal; Nevis of Saint Kitts and Nevis; the Canary Islands and the two autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla) of Spain; and entities with non-recognized unique autonomy, such as Kurdistan of Iraq; Wa of Myanmar; Gaza of Palestine; Galmudug and Puntland of Somalia; Rojava of Syria; and Zanzibar of Tanzania are also not included. All claims in Antarctica are listed in italics.\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia has six external territories in its administration and one Antarctic claim.\n\nAlthough all territories of Australia are considered to be fully integrated in its federal system, and the official status of an external territory does not differ largely from that of a mainland territory (except in regards to immigration law), debate remains as to whether the external territories are integral parts of Australia, due to their not being part of Australia in 1901, when its constituent states federated (with the exception of the Coral Sea Islands, which was a part of Queensland).[15] Norfolk Island was self-governing from 1979 to 2016.[16] The external territories are often grouped separately from Australia proper for statistical purposes.[citation needed]\n\nExternal territory Administration ISO 3166 country code Christmas Island Administered from Canberra by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts[17] CX Cocos (Keeling) Islands CC Norfolk Island NF External territory\n\n(uninhabited) Administration ISO 3166 country code Ashmore and Cartier Islands Administered from Canberra by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts[17] No unique ISO 3166 country codes Coral Sea Islands[note 4] Heard Island and McDonald Islands Administered from Canberra by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment[17] HM External territory\n\n(uninhabited, claimed) Administration ISO 3166 country code Australian Antarctic Territory Administered from Canberra by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment[17]\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) has two special administrative regions (SARs) that are governed according to the constitution and respective basic laws. The SARs greatly differ from Mainland China in administrative, economic, legislative, and judicial terms including by currency, left-hand versus right-hand traffic, official languages, and immigration control. Although the PRC does claim sovereignty over Taiwan (governed by the Republic of China), it is not listed here as the PRC government does not have de facto control of the territory.\n\nSpecial administrative region Administration ISO 3166 country code Hong Kong Former British colony. Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China since 1997 according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty registered with the United Nations. The Hong Kong Basic Law purports to provide for the territory to enjoy a \"high degree\" of autonomy per the \"one country, two systems\" model under the central government of China. Although the territory is not part of mainland China, it is officially considered an integral part of the People's Republic of China.[18][19][20] HK or\n\nCN-HK\n\nMacao Former Portuguese colony. Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China since 1999 according to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, an international treaty registered with the United Nations.

All citizens of the Dutch Kingdom share the same nationality and are thus citizens of the European Union, but only the European portion of the Kingdom is a part of the territory of the Union, the Customs Union, and the Eurozone while other areas have overseas countries and territory status.\n\nConstituent country Administration ISO 3166 country code Aruba Defined as a \"country\" (\"land\") within the Kingdom by the Statute of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba obtained full autonomy in internal affairs upon separation from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986. Part of the Kingdom but not in Europe, its citizenship nonetheless includes status as citizens of the European Union (the Kingdom government coincides almost exactly with the Government of the Netherlands, and is responsible for defence, foreign affairs, and nationality law). AW or\n\nNL-AW\n\nCuraçao Defined as a \"country\" (\"land\") within the Kingdom by the Statute of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Curaçao and Sint Maarten were part of the Netherlands Antilles until it was dissolved in October 2010.

CW or\n\nNL-CW\n\nSint Maarten SX or\n\nNL-SX\n\nNorway\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Svalbard and Jan Mayen\n\nNorway has, in the Arctic, one inhabited archipelago with restrictions placed on Norwegian sovereignty — Svalbard.[28][29] Unlike the country's dependent territory (Bouvet Island) and Antarctic claims (see above), Svalbard is a part of the Kingdom of Norway.[30]\n\nTerritory Administration ISO 3166 country code Svalbard This Arctic archipelago is the northernmost permanent civilian settlement in the world. Not incorporated into any county, it is administered by a governor appointed by the Norwegian government. Since 2002, its main settlement of Longyearbyen has elected a local government. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research station of Ny-Ålesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognises Norwegian sovereignty (administered since 1925 as a sovereign part of the Kingdom of Norway) but established Svalbard as a free economic zone[28] and a demilitarised zone. SJ or\n\nNO-21\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nThree Crown Dependencies are in a form of association with the United Kingdom. They are independently administrated jurisdictions, although the British Government is solely responsible for defence and international representation and has ultimate responsibility for ensuring good government. They do not have diplomatic recognition as independent states, but neither are they integrated into the UK. The UK Parliament retains the ability to legislate for the crown dependencies even without the agreement of their legislatures. No crown dependency has representation in the UK Parliament.\n\nAlthough they are British Overseas Territories, Bermuda and Gibraltar have similar relationships to the UK as do the Crown Dependencies. While Britain is officially responsible for their defence and international representation, these jurisdictions maintain their own militaries and have been granted limited diplomatic powers, in addition to having internal self-government.\n\nNew Zealand and its dependencies share the same governor-general and constitute one monarchic realm. The Cook Islands and Niue are officially termed associated states.\n\nPuerto Rico (since 1952) and the Northern Mariana Islands (since 1986) are non-independent states freely associated with the United States. The mutually negotiated Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States was approved in 1976. The covenant was fully implemented on November 3, 1986, under Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred U.S. citizenship on legally qualified CNMI residents.[31] Under the Constitution of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico is described as a Commonwealth and Puerto Ricans have a degree of administrative autonomy similar to that of a citizen of a U.S. state. Puerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917, as a result of the Jones–Shafroth Act.[32][33] The commonly used name in Spanish of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, literally \"Associated Free State of Puerto Rico\", which sounds similar to \"free association\" particularly when loosely used in Spanish, is sometimes erroneously interpreted to mean that Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States is based on a Compact of Free Association and at other times is erroneously held to mean that Puerto Rico's relationship with the U.S. is based on an Interstate compact. This is a constant source of ambiguity and confusion when trying to define, understand, and explain Puerto Rico's political relationship with the United States. For various reasons Puerto Rico's political status differs from that of the Pacific Islands that entered into Compacts of Free Association with the United States. As sovereign states, these islands have the full right to conduct their foreign relations, while the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has territorial status subject to U.S. congressional authority under the Constitution's Territory Clause, \"to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory… belonging to the United States.\"[34] Puerto Rico does not have the right to unilaterally declare independence, and at the last referendum (1998), the narrow majority voted for \"none of the above\", which was a formally undefined alternative used by commonwealth supporters to express their desire for an \"enhanced commonwealth\" option.[34]\n\nThis kind of relationship can also be found in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is termed a federacy. The European continental part is organised like a unitary state. However, the status of its \"constituent countries\" in the Caribbean (Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten) can be considered akin to dependencies[35][36] or \"associated non-independent states.\"\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark also operates similarly, akin to another federacy. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are two self-governing territories or regions within the Kingdom. The relationship between Denmark proper and these two territories is semi-officially termed the Rigsfællesskabet (\"Unity of the Realm\").\n\nOverview of inhabited dependent territories\n\n[edit]\n\nName Population (2016)[37] Area (km2)[38] Area (mi2)[38] UN region UN subregion Sovereign state Legal status[39] Akrotiri and Dhekelia 15,700 254 98 Asia Western Asia United Kingdom Overseas territory\n\n(Sovereign Base Areas) Åland 29,013 1,580 610 Europe Northern Europe Finland Autonomous region American Samoa 54,194 199 77 Oceania Polynesia United States Unincorporated unorganized territory Anguilla 15,100 91 35 Americas Caribbean United Kingdom Overseas territory Aruba 113,648 178.91 69.08 Americas Caribbean Netherlands Constituent country Bermuda 70,537 53.2 20.5 Americas Northern America United Kingdom Overseas territory British Virgin Islands 34,232 153 59 Americas Caribbean United Kingdom Overseas territory Cayman Islands 57,268 264 101.9 Americas Caribbean United Kingdom Overseas territory Christmas Island 2,205 135 52 Oceania Australia and New Zealand Australia External territory Cocos (Keeling) Islands 596 14 5.4 Oceania Australia and New Zealand Australia External territory Cook Islands 18,100 240 93 Oceania Polynesia New Zealand Associated state Curaçao 158,986 444 171 Americas Caribbean Netherlands Constituent country Falkland Islands 2,931 12,173 4,700 Americas South America United Kingdom Overseas territory Faroe Islands 49,188 4,167 540 Europe Northern Europe Denmark Autonomous territory French Polynesia 285,735 1,399 1,609 Oceania Polynesia France Overseas collectivity\n\n(Overseas country) Gibraltar 29,328 6.5 2.5 Europe Southern Europe United Kingdom Overseas territory Greenland 56,483 2,166,086 836,330 Americas Northern America Denmark Autonomous territory Guam 162,742 544 210 Oceania Micronesia United States Unincorporated organized territory Guernsey 63,026 65 25 Europe Northern Europe United Kingdom Crown Dependency Hong Kong 7,374,000 2,755 1,064 Asia Eastern Asia China Special administrative region Isle of Man 88,195 572 221 Europe Northern Europe United Kingdom Crown Dependency Jersey 98,069 118.2 45.6 Europe Northern Europe United Kingdom Crown Dependency Macao 650,900 115.3 44.5 Asia Eastern Asia China Special administrative region Montserrat 5,267 101 39 Americas Caribbean United Kingdom Overseas territory New Caledonia 275,355 18,576 7,172 Oceania Melanesia France Sui generis collectivity Niue 1,190 261.46 100.95 Oceania Polynesia New Zealand Associated state Norfolk Island 2,210 34.6 13.4 Oceania Australia and New Zealand Australia External territory Northern Mariana Islands 53,467 464 179 Oceania Micronesia United States Unincorporated organized territory\n\n(Commonwealth) Pitcairn Islands 57 43 17 Oceania Polynesia United Kingdom Overseas territory Puerto Rico 3,411,307 9,104 3,515 Americas Caribbean United States Unincorporated organized territory\n\n(Commonwealth) Saint Barthélemy 7,209 25 9.7 Americas Caribbean France Overseas collectivity Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha 5,633 394 152 Africa Western Africa United Kingdom Overseas territory Saint Martin 31,949 53.2 20.5 Americas Caribbean France Overseas collectivity Saint Pierre and Miquelon 5,595 242 93 Americas Northern America France Overseas collectivity Sint Maarten 41,486 37 14 Americas Caribbean Netherlands Constituent country Svalbard 2,667 61,022 23,561 Europe Northern Europe Norway Unincorporated area Tokelau 1,499 10 3.9 Oceania Polynesia New Zealand Dependent territory Turks and Caicos Islands 51,430 430 166 Americas Caribbean United Kingdom Overseas territory U.S. Virgin Islands 102,951 346.36 133.73 Americas Caribbean United States Unincorporated organized territory Wallis and Futuna 15,664 142 55 Oceania Polynesia France Overseas collectivity\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
