        "text": "THE BRITISH COME TO THE ISLAND\n\n1664\n\nIn 1664, the English captured New Amsterdam, renamed it New York, and took Nutten Island (the British mispronunciation of the Dutch name). The city and the Island switched hands between the British and the Dutch over the next decade until the British regained exclusive control of the Island for “his majesties fort and garrison.\"\n\nBRITISH GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE\n\n1699\n\nThe Island was renamed “Governors Island”, and reserved for the “benefit and accommodation of His Majesty’s Governors.”\n\nBECOMING PART OF NEW YORK\n\n1750\n\nGovernors Island was made part of the British territory of New York County under the Montgomerie Charter. The Charter was a typical method of colonial governance that expanded the city’s powers under British rule. The Charter gave the city some judicial powers and control over the establishment of ferries, docks and construction of public buildings.\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\n1776\n\nOn June 7, 1775, just two months after the first major dissent in the colonies, the British were unable to continue occupying New York. British forces withdrew to Canada to replenish supplies and forces before attempting to retake the city, including Governors Island.\n\nBATTLE AGAINST THE BRITISH\n\n1776\n\nAfter the British withdrew from the Island, continental troops fortified the Island for fear of advances by the British Royal Navy. At the Battle of Brooklyn, the British Army overpowered General George Washington and his men, and American forces retreated from Long Island and Governors Island. The city and the Island were occupied by the British and used as their North American military headquarters for the rest of the American Revolution.\n\nBRITISH WITHDRAWAL\n\n1783\n\nAt the end of the Revolutionary War, British troops withdrew from the city on November 25. This date would be celebrated as \"Evacuation Day,\" a city holiday for the next century. The British Royal Navy departed the Island on December 4th, and the Royal Navy surrendered to the Continental Army.\n\nFORTIFYING A NEW REPUBLIC\n\n1794 - 1800\n\nAfter the American Revolution, the state of New York inherited all lands owned by the British, including Governors Island. In 1794, with the country in need of a system of coastal defenses, the fledgling government began to fortify the Harbor, including construction of a fort, later to be named Fort Jay, on high ground in the center of the Island. In 1800, New York transferred the Island to the U.S. government for military use.\n\nFORT JAY, CASTLE WILLIAMS AND SOUTH BATTERY\n\n1806 - 1812\n\nBetween 1806 and 1809, the U.S. Army reconstructed Fort Jay and renamed it Fort Columbus (in 1904, the name would be changed back to Fort Jay). Castle Williams, the second of three historical forts, was built on a rocky outcropping facing the harbor. In 1812, the South Battery, the third fort on the Island, was constructed. During the War of 1812, artillery and infantry troops were concentrated on Governors Island. The recently built fortifications deterred a British invasion, sparing New York the fiery fate that befell Washington, D.C.\n\nISLAND EXPANSION\n\n1912\n\nPhysically, the Island changed greatly during the early 20th century. Using rocks and dirt from the excavation of the Lexington Avenue Subway and dredge from New York Harbor, the Army Corps of Engineers supervised the deposit of 4,787,000 cubic yards of fill on the south side of Governors Island. This fill was used to add 103 acres of flat, treeless land, increasing the size of the Island to 172 acres by 1912.\n\nWORLD WAR I\n\n1917\n\nIn the first act of the war by U.S. armed services, the 22nd Infantry Regiment stationed on Governors Island seized all German-owned cruise ships and ship terminals in the Hudson River in Manhattan and Hoboken. Within weeks, the ships would be used to transport most of the two million American soldiers to France to fight in the war.\n\nThe 22nd Infantry stayed on the Island for the duration of the war, protecting the supply depot and vital infrastructure between New York City and Washington, D.C.\n\nCONNECTION TO THE CITY\n\n1922\n\nWith the arrival of the 16th Infantry Regiment on Governors Island and Fort Jay in 1922, a strong connection was forged between the U.S. Army and the citizens of New York City. The regimental band marched in the city parades and had an Army camp at the 1939 World's Fair, while the public was invited to watch polo matches and mock battles staged on the Island.\n\nWORLD WAR II\n\n1941\n\nBetween the two world wars, the Island served as an important headquarters for Army ground and air forces. By World War II, the U.S. First Army used it as its headquarters. Originally established in Europe in 1919, the First Army initiated their planning efforts for the D-Day invasion on Governors Island. The D-Day invasion led to the American landing in Normandy, and the liberation of Europe.\n\nTHE ARMY DEPARTS\n\n1965\n\nIn the 1960s, U.S. Army continued to construct barracks and apartment buildings on the southern portion of the Island. The Island remained an army post and quiet neighborhood for military families until November 1964. In response to changing military technology and budget constraints, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the pending closure of Governors Island and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\n\nCOAST GUARD INSTALLATION\n\n1966\n\nIn 1966, the Island was transferred to the United States Coast Guard. The Island became the Coast Guard's largest installation, with a self-contained residential community of approximately 3,000 and a commuting population of another 1500. Under the Coast Guard, the Island was the home of the Atlantic Area Command, the Maintenance and Logistics Command, and the Captain of the Port of New York.\n\nA BACKDROP FOR HISTORY\n\n1986-1993\n\nOver the years, Governors Island served as the backdrop for a number of historic events. In 1986, the Island was the setting for the relighting of the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty by President Ronald Reagan. In 1988, President Reagan hosted a final meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev on Governors Island, and in 1993, the United Nations sponsored talks on the Island to help restore democratic rule in Haiti.\n\nTHE FIRST VISITORS\n\n2003\n\nNational Park Service rangers gave the first guided tours of the Island to approximately 4,000 visitors between June and October.\n\nOPEN TO THE PUBLIC\n\n2006\n\n8,000 visitors came to Governors Island during 2005, the first year the Island was open to the public.\n\nSTARTING WITH PARKS AND PUBLIC SPACE\n\n2007\n\nThe decision was made to start the redevelopment of Governors Island with a design competition for new parks and public open space. The acclaimed landscape architecture firm West 8 was selected to design the Governors Island Park and Public Space Master Plan, which marked an important first step in the transformation of Governors Island.\n\nThat same year, GIPEC demolished a derelict Super 8 Motel on the Parade Ground, opening up more green space for the public to enjoy.\n\nPICNIC POINT AND FERRIES FROM BROOKLYN\n\n2009\n\nFerries began running from Brooklyn for the first time. Picnic Point opened on the southern tip of the Island and the 2.2 mile promenade was opened to pedestrians and cyclists. With more to do and see than ever, the Island welcomed more than 275,000 people in 2009.\n\nFIRST YEAR ROUND TENANTS\n\n2010\n\nThe Urban Assembly New York Harbor School and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Art Center became the first year-round tenants on Governors Island. The Harbor School, a New York City public high school, restored Building 555 on the Island’s western shore to provide a college-preparatory education built on New York City’s maritime experience. The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council restored a large portion of Building 110 near Soissons Landing as a year-round shared, multidisciplinary space providing a retreat style artist residency and public exhibitions.\n\nA PUBLIC SPACE MASTER PLAN\n\nThe West 8-designed Governors Island Park and Public Space Master Plan was released in 2010. The plan encompasses 85 acres of public open space on the Island, including new visitor amenities and improvements to the landscapes of the Historic District, a new park on the Island’s southern end, and a new 2.2 mile promenade around the perimeter.\n\nTHE CITY TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOVERNORS ISLAND\n\nIn April 2010, Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Paterson reached an agreement on the future of Governors Island. The City of New York, now responsible for Governors Island, created the Trust for Governors Island and charged it with the operations, planning and redevelopment of the Island.\n\nCASTLE WILLIAMS OPENS TO THE PUBLIC\n\n2011\n\nAfter an extensive rehabilitation project in 2011, the National Park Service opened Castle Williams to the general public for the first time in the fort's 200-year history.\n\nPARK GROUND BREAKING\n\n2012\n\nThe Trust broke ground on the first phase of construction for the Island’s new park and public spaces, along with an ambitious capital program to bring the Island’s infrastructure into the 21st\n\ncentury.\n\nIMPLOSION!\n\n2013\n\nIn the early morning of June 9, 2013, Building 877 was imploded with 200 lbs of dynamite. The derelict 11-story apartment building on the southern end of Governors Island, where Outlook Hill and the ballfields now stand, had been vacant since 1996. Demolition debris was later used in the construction of The Hills.\n\nNEW PARK\n\n2014\n\nThe first 30 acres of new park opened to the public in May 2014. On land that was once flat and featureless, visitors were now able to enjoy a meal in Liggett Terrace, play or nap in Hammock Grove, or play sports on the Play Lawn. Potable water was restored as well, which was another major milestone readying the Island for its future.\n\nTHE HILLS ARE ALIVE\n\n2016\n\nThe Hills, the culminating feature of the new park and public spaces, opened to the public nearly one year ahead of schedule.\n\nEXPANDING THE PUBLIC SEASON\n\n2017\n\nIn 2017, Governors Island remained open to the public through October for the first time, allowing visitors to experience its scenic settings in a new season.\n\nGOVERNORS 1 LAUNCHES\n\n2019\n\nThe Trust for Governors Island commissioned Rhode Island-based Blount Boats to construct a brand-new vessel, the Governors 1, to increase service between the Island and Manhattan during the public season. The 400-passenger new ferry launched in summer 2019.\n\nLMCC'S ARTS CENTER OPENS\n\n2019\n\nFollowing its use as a venue for artist studios, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and the Trust partnered on a renovation of Building 110 into the first permanent home for the arts on Governors Island. LMCC’s Arts Center includes galleries for exhibitions and installations, space for public programs, year-round studio areas for up to 40 artists, and a café.\n\nA CENTER FOR CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\n\n2020\n\nIn September 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Trust for Governors Island announced plans to develop a Center for Climate Solutions as part of the Mayor’s Recovery Agenda. The Center would bring together a cross-disciplinary community of researchers, educators, advocates, innovators and policymakers to create, test and implement the solutions our urban environments need today and in the decades to come. With its millions of visitors and unique waterfront and ecological resources, Governors Island can serve as an inspiring example of sustainable and resilient urban development and an unparalleled destination for broad public participation and engagement.\n\nGOVERNORS ISLAND ARTS LAUNCHES\n\n2022\n\nIn 2022, the arts and cultural programs presented by the Trust officially launched as Governors Island Arts, and the program debuted two ambitious commissions—Moving Chains by Charles Gaines (pictured) and The Open Orchard by Sam Van Aken, each years in the making.\n\nTHE NEW YORK CLIMATE EXCHANGE SELECTED TO ANCHOR THE CENTER FOR CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\n\n2023\n\nIn April 2023, fol­low­ing a two-year com­pet­i­tive process, New York City May­or Eric Adams and the Trust for Gov­er­nors Island announced the selec­tion of the New York Cli­mate Exchange, led by Stony Brook Uni­ver­si­ty, as the anchor insti­tu­tion for the Cen­ter for Cli­mate Solu­tions. The Exchange, scheduled to open in 2028, will be a first-of-its-kind, cross-sec­­tor non­prof­it orga­ni­za­tion ded­i­cat­ed to cli­mate research, solu­tion devel­op­ment, edu­ca­tion, work­force train­ing, and pub­lic pro­grams on Gov­er­nors Island."
