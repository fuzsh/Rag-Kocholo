        "text": "From the period of the War of Independence until World War I, the pastoral care of military personnel was provided for in various ways under the authority of the local Ordinaries. On November 24, 1917, the Apostolic See appointed a Bishop for the Military in the United States. On November 25, 1939, the Archbishop of New York was designated.as Military Vicar for U.S. military personnel. On June 13, 1946, the jurisdiction of the Military Vicar was extended to Catholic civilians serving the U.S. Government overseas and further amplified on November 4, 1954. In 1946 the Veterans Administration was placed under the same jurisdiction.\n\nSubsequent to the Instruction Sollemne Semper (April 25, 1951), the Apostolic See, by the Decree Mysticam Petri Naviculam (September 8, 1957), formally erected the Military Vicariate to be united to the office of the Archbishop of New York. On December 15, 1975, a Coadjutor to the Military Vicar was appointed. Finally, by the Decree Apostolica Sedes (January 14, 1984), the Military Vicariate was established as an independent archdiocese, and the new Military Archbishop was installed on March 25, 1985. I. The canonical or official name of the previously entitled Military Vicariate is Military Ordinariate. For suitable usage in the United States, the Military Ordinariate shall be known as The Archdiocese for the Military Services, U.S.A. II. The Military Ordinariate is governed by the norms of:\n\n(a) The Apostolic Constitution Spirituali Militum Curae of April 21, 1986.\n\n(b) These particular statutes approved by the Holy See.\n\n(c) The universal laws of the Church even though not specified in the preceding documents.\n\n(d) The particular laws of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nIII. The seat and principal church of the Military Ordinariate are established in Washington, D.C. The Curia shall be located in Washington or its environs. IV. The Military Ordinary shall be assigned archiepiscopal dignity and shall enjoy the rights and be held to the obligations proper to a diocesan bishop. Though directly subject to the Holy See, he is to participate in the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. V. Unless the Apostolic See provide otherwise, Sede vacante vel impedita, the College of Consultors shall elect a Diocesan Administrator (cc. 412 to 430). VI. A suitable number of Auxiliary Bishops shall be appointed, at the pleasure of the Apostolic See, to assist the Military Ordinary in his pastoral ministry and in the care of souls in this far-extended jurisdiction. The Auxiliary Bishops shall be appointed according to the pastoral necessity of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, U.S.A. according to the norm of c. 403 §1. VII.

The Military Ordinariate possesses its own proper Tribunal; the Judicial Vicar is appointed freely by the Military Ordinary.

The presbyterate of the Military Ordinariate is composed of those priests, either secular or religious, who, in the judgment of the Military Ordinary, are endowed with the qualities suited to the proper performance of this special pastoral work, and with the consent of their Ordinary, perform an office in the Military Ordinariate.

XII. A Presbyteral Council, a College of Consultors, a Finance Council, and Review Board are established according to the norm of Canon Law.

VI §5, the relevant statutes are approved by the Military Ordinary, taking into account the norms issued by the Episcopal Conference. XIII. The faithful of the Military Ordinariate, by the witness of their Christian lives and by carrying out their responsibilities in virtue of their rebirth in Christ in Baptism, cooperate in the building up of the Body of Christ. They play their own part as an apostolic and even missionary leaven among the other military personnel with whom they are associated and lead their lives. XIV. Every five years the Military Ordinary shall present a report on the state of the Ordinariate to the Apostolic See, according to the prescribed formula. The Military Ordinary is held to the obligations of the “visita ad limina,” according to the norm of law. XV.

XVIII. The records of all sacraments celebrated on U.S. military installations anywhere in the world and Veterans Affairs hospitals, i.e., of baptisms, confirmations, receptions into full communion of the Catholic Church, marriages are sent by the sacramental minister whether a priest of the Military Ordinariate or civilian, to the Curia of the Military Ordinariate, where they are registered according to the norms of Canon Law. Also, other records of the Ordinariate are kept in the Curial archives. XIX. These particular statutes shall take the force of law one month from the date of their approval by the Holy See and cannot be modified without its approval. The Military Ordinary, having heard the Presbyteral Council, can propose to Holy See any modifications deemed necessary. These Statues were approved by the Apostolic See on 23 January 2021."
