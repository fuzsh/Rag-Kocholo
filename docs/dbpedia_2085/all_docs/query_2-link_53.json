        "text": "Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a classification system that was first developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to organize and arrange the book collections of the Library of Congress. The third edition of LCC (released in 1954) was the first to include a full classification scheme for maps. Cartographic materials are now cataloged in the \"G\" classification schedule, including atlases (G1000-3122), globes (G3160-3171), and maps (G3180-9980). Items are sub-arranged by designated regions, counties, cities, localities, etc. within the G classification schedule, with what is referred to as a \"geographic Cutter.\" A full list of geographic Cutters can be found on ClassWeb Plus and is linked to on the Geographic Cutters page.\n\nThe Geography and Map Division maintains and develops a list of subject Cutters for further sub-classification of the specific content of a cartographic item. These subject Cutters are appended to the classification number following the geographic Cutter. The subject Cutters are found below.\n\nSummary of Form and Subject Subdivisions\n\nA - Special category maps and atlases\n\nB - Mathematical geography\n\nC - Physical sciences\n\nD - Biogeography\n\nE - Human and cultural geography. Anthropogeography. Human ecology\n\nF - Political geography\n\nG - Economic geography\n\nH - Mines and mineral resources\n\nJ - Agriculture\n\nK - Forests and forestry\n\nL - Aquatic biological resources\n\nM - Manufacturing and processing. Service industries\n\nN - Technology Engineering. Public works\n\nP - Transportation and communication\n\nQ - Commerce and trade. Finance\n\nR - Military and naval geography\n\nS - Historical geography\n\nClass with any subject subdivision works which encompass two or more of its listed subtopics or any subtopic(s) not listed. Works on individual social, geographic, or socio-geographic features such as canals, dams, forests, university campuses, historic trails, etc., are classed as geographic features, e. g., G4352.H79, Hoover Dam. Works showing the distribution of a certain type of feature are classed with the subject e.g., G4301.N2, Dams in the New Southwest\n\nS - Historical Geography\n\nClass here maps and atlases that portray specific historical events, including disposition of troops, battle lines, or a series of events.\n\nA map or atlas, either contemporary or reconstructed, which gives only general geographical information about an area at the time of a given event or series of events is treated without subject subdivision.\n\nA chronological subdivision for an area, based on its own history, is to be preferred to any universal arrangement except that the following Cutter numbers are to remain constant throughout the schedule.\n\nFor examples of such arrangements, see G3201.S World history, and G3701.S United States history.\n\n.S1General .S12Discovery and exploration .S65World War I .S7World War II"
