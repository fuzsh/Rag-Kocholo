        "text": "What does the Arctic Council do?\n\nThe Council’s Strategic Plan 2021-2030 guides its work towards the Arctic as a “region of peace, stability and constructive cooperation, that is a vibrant, prosperous, sustainable and secure home for all its inhabitants, including Indigenous Peoples, and where their rights and wellbeing are respected.”\n\nHow and when was the Arctic Council established?\n\nThe Arctic Council was established on 19 September 1996 when the governments of Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States signed the Ottawa Declaration. The establishment of the Arctic Council was preceded by the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (June 1991), a declaration on the protection of the Arctic environment.\n\nWhat are some Arctic Council accomplishments?\n\nThe Arctic Council regularly produces comprehensive, cutting-edge environmental, ecological and social assessments through its Working Groups.\n\nThe Council has also provided a forum for the negotiation of three important legally binding agreements among the eight Arctic States:\n\nAgreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic (2011)\n\nAgreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic (2013)\n\nAgreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017)\n\nWho chairs the Arctic Council?\n\nThe Chairmanship of the Arctic Council rotates every two years among the Arctic States. The first country to chair the Arctic Council was Canada (1996-1998), followed by the United States, Finland, Iceland, the Russian Federation, Norway, the Kingdom of Denmark, and Sweden. The second cycle of Chairmanships began in 2013.\n\nSee all Chairmanships.\n\nWhat is a Senior Arctic Official (SAO)?\n\nEach Arctic State appoints a Senior Arctic Official (SAO) to manage its interests in the Arctic Council. Each SAO is thus a government representative, usually from an Arctic State's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The SAOs guide and monitor the Arctic Council's activities in accordance with the decisions and instructions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arctic States. That guidance is usually provided in the form of Ministerial Declarations, which are produced roughly every two years when the Chairmanship of the Arctic Council rotates.\n\nWhen and where does the Arctic Council meet?\n\nSAOs and Permanent Participants meet at least twice a year, while all partners meet at Ministerial Meetings held every two years. These meetings are typically held in the Arctic State that holds the Chairmanship at the time of the meeting. Working Groups and Task Forces hold additional meetings in other locations and at other times.\n\nWhat is the role of the Arctic Council Secretariat (ACS)?\n\nThe Arctic Council Secretariat is an administrative office that works under the direction of the Senior Arctic Officials and the Arctic Council Chairmanship. Any available vacancies at the Arctic Council Secretariat are posted on the Arctic Council website.\n\nWhat doesn’t the Arctic Council do?\n\nThe Arctic Council is a forum; it has no programming budget. All projects or initiatives are sponsored by one or more Arctic States. Some projects also receive support from other entities.\n\nThe Arctic Council does not and cannot implement or enforce its guidelines, assessments or recommendations. That responsibility belongs to individual Arctic States or international bodies.\n\nThe Arctic Council’s mandate, as articulated in the Ottawa Declaration, explicitly excludes military security."
