        "text": "Regional headquarters also manage and train hundreds of Reserve Service Members (RSMs) assigned to Selective Service in their regions. The Selective Service System has about 150 National Guard and Reserve members authorized. They are members of every branch of the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces, with the exception of the Air National Guard. RSMs perform 48 drills and two weeks of annual training per year.\n\nThis part-time cadre of military officers is paid by the respective military service component; however, the individual services are reimbursed for most costs incurred, including RSM travel, pay, and benefit expenses. The reservistsâ jobs are to train and be ready in the case of a return to the draft, to assist in improving on-time registration of young men in Americaâs communities, and to conduct training for board members. In the event of a draft, RSMs would open and staff more than 400 Selective Service area offices, be assigned to state headquarters, and serve as liaison officers at Military Entrance Processing Stations. RSM assignments and activities are controlled by each region headquarters.\n\nServe with Us\n\nIf you are a Guard member or Reservist, find out more about opportunities to serve as a Selective Service RSM in your area by emailing us at HR-Mil@sss.gov.\n\nA Selective Service local board is a group of citizen volunteers whose mission, during a draft, would be to decide who among the registrants in their community would receive deferments, postponements, or exemption from military service based on the individual registrantâs circumstances and beliefs.\n\nAppeal Boards\n\nThe registrant appeal process begins when a registrant is dissatisfied with his Local Boardâs decision about his reclassification request and initiates an appeal. The first line of appeal is to the District Appeal Board. In the case of non-unanimous decisions of the District Appeal Board, the registrant may appeal to the President through the National Appeal Board.\n\nThe Director and State Directors of Selective Service may also take appeals to a District Appeal Board to ensure fair and equitable administration of Selective Service law and regulations.\n\nDistrict Appeal Boards are located in each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and Virgin Islands. The law requires at least one such board within the area of each federal judicial district in the United States and within each territory and possession.\n\nPeacetime Duties\n\nThe board member program is one of the primary components of the Selective Service System. Approximately 11,000 volunteers are currently trained in Selective Service regulations and procedures so that if a draft is reinstated, they will be able to fulfill their obligations fairly and equitably. Board members undergo an initial 8-hour training session and then participate in annual training in which they review sample cases similar to real-life situations.\n\nActive Draft Duties\n\nRegistrants with low lottery numbers will be ordered to report for a physical, mental, and moral evaluation at a Military Entrance Processing Station to determine whether they are fit for military service. Once he is notified of the results of the evaluation, a registrant will be given 10 days to file a claim for exemption, postponement, or deferment. At that time, board members will begin reviewing and deciding the outcome of the individual registrantâs case. They may personally interview the registrant and persons who know him to gain a better understanding of his situation. A man may appeal a Local Boardâs decision to a Selective Service District Appeal Board."
