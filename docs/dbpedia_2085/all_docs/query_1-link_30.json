The designation of a land area encompasses all internal waters, unless otherwise noted. For HFP and/or IDP purposes, the term “internal waters” is defined as waters landward of the baseline, drawn in accordance with international law.\n\n2. The designation of a water area (such as the Persian Gulf) includes the territorial seas of those waters, but not the internal waters of the coastal lands. For example, all waters of the Persian Gulf seaward of the baseline of the coastal states, drawn in accordance with international law, would be included in the Persian Gulf designation.\n\n3. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, airspace is NOT part of the included area. When airspace is specifically included, it will normally be that space directly vertically above the approved land or sea area.\n\n4. This figure reflects all designated areas, which were active within the last six years.\n\n5. Limited to Service members performing duties within the Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay Detention Facilities.\n\n6. Land area within a 20-km radius from the center of Athens (38° 01’ N, 23° 44’ E).\n\n7. Water area of the Mediterranean Sea extending from the North African Coast northward into Mediterranean Sea, bounded on the east at: 26° 00’ E longitude; extending north to: 34° 35’ N latitude; and extending west to: the East Coast of Tunisia.\n\n8. Water area of the Somalia Basin with coordinates:\n\n- 11°10’N-51°15’E;\n\n- 06°00’N-48°30’E;\n\n- 05°00’N-50°30’E;\n\n- 11°30’N-53°34’E;\n\n- 05°00’N-50°30’E;\n\n- 01°00’N-47°00’E;\n\n- 03°00’S-43°00’E;\n\n- 01°00’S-41°00’E; and\n\n- 06°00’N-48°30’E.\n\n9. Excluding Izmir and the Turkish Straits (i.e., the Dardanelles; the Sea of Marmara; and the Bosporus Straits).\n\n10. Airspace: south of 37°45’N; and east of 43°00’E"
