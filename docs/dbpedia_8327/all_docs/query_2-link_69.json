        "text": "RE. Cornelius Johnson, @ Jacinto Regalado, who says: âThis is an early Cornelius Johnson (1620): https://bit.ly/2ZARMn4 The quality is clearly superior to that of the picture under discussion, unless it has been damaged by restoration. However, style of Cornelius Johnson would be plausible.â\n\nYes, but would you wait until you could paint that well before you started doing it professionally? Nor did he. Especially as all accounts state that he was in London working for a year or two before then. There are no 1618 or 19 portraits by Cornelius Johnson that are as accomplished as that. Earlier ones are less accomplished. As is the work in question.\n\nI think it is unsafe to say the portrait is in the style of CJ. It is either almost certainly by him in an earlier style he had, or it is by someone else. It cannot be said it is âstyle ofâ as how can it be in the style of someone whose style it doesnât match and/or who hasnât become a significant painter in London yet, unless he had, and this was like his earlier style, then if so, it may well actually be by him.\n\nThe 1618-19 style is more like late-Tudor portraiture, and he would have initially had a style more like that of the Netherlands he came out of. 1619-20 on, more heading towards Van Dyck eventually. It is said that Johnson could learn and vary his style as needed, even later imitating Van Dyck so much that some people think that some Van Dyck-attributed works are unsafe.\n\nIf the portrait under discussion is not by Cornelius Johnson, then every other early and unsigned work attributed to Cornelius Johnson is unsafe. That begs the question why wasnât he working when he was in London in 1618 and 1619? If he was, what was he working on? Maybe on portraits in an earlier style that some people now donât think were by him because it doesnât match the style of a year later and he didnât sign them.\n\nIt is entirely possible that he had an earlier style, and works he didnât sign, then sometime in later 1619 his style advanced and he began signing his works also.\n\nAnne of Denmarkâs funeral, which I associate the work in question with, was on 13th May 1619. I suggest signing the front bottom-right corner on the oval began sometime in later 1619.\n\nEither the early unsigned ones are not by him, and a lot of museums, galleries and collections need to be informed, or they are.\n\nA possible timeline of works, with style advancing:\n\nEarly unsigned:\n\nJohn Milton, after Cornelius Johnson, 1618\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw199459/John-Milton?LinkID=mp02441&sort=dateAsc&role=art&rNo=3\n\nThe Countess of Exeter, c. 1620, Cornelius Janssen van Ceulen. Style similar to the work in question.\n\nhttps://i2.wp.com/blog.mam.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/r_m1989_68_001.jpg?resize=580,749&ssl=1\n\nhttps://blog.mam.org/2017/10/24/from-the-collection-the-countess-of-exeter-by-cornelius-janssen-van-ceulen/\n\nThe work in question, that I say is 1619.\n\nLady Margaret Mennes, c. 1620, attributed to Cornelius Johnson. Composition almost identical to the work in question.\n\nhttps://www.sellingantiques.co.uk/photosnew/dealer_precious/dealer_precious_full_1260778937299-5989091293.jpg\n\nThen the signed works begin:\n\nPortrait of a Woman by Cornelius Janssen van Ceulen, 1619 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Portrait_of_a_Woman_by_Cornelius_Janssen_van_Ceulen,_1619_-_Cleveland_Museum_of_Art_-_DSC08862.JPG\n\nPortrait of a Woman, Traditionally Identified as the Countess of Arundel, Cornelius Johnson, 1619\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Cornelius_Johnson_-_Portrait_of_a_Woman,_Traditionally_Identified_as_the_Countess_of_Arundel_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/440px-Cornelius_Johnson_-_Portrait_of_a_Woman,_Traditionally_Identified_as_the_Countess_of_Arundel_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nSir Alexander Temple, Cornelius Johnson, 1920 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Cornelius_Johnson_-_Sir_Alexander_Temple_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nPortrait of Susanna Temple, Later Lady Lister Cornelius Johnson, 1620\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Cornelius_Johnson_-_Portrait_of_Susanna_Temple,_Later_Lady_Lister_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nThis is the sitter, or a very close relative of the sitter, in another portrait:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Alathea_Talbot_{LPARENTHESES} Ingestre_Hall_Residential_Arts_Centre).jpg\n\nhttps://artuk.org/discover/artworks/alathea-talbot-c-15901654-countess-of-arundel-and-surrey-20804\n\nThey look very close, and are wearing a same or very similar earring in both.\n\nI think the work in question and the one at Ingestre are both of âBrighid Nic Gearailt, Brighid Chill Dara, Lady Bridget Barnewall, Viscountess Kingsland, earlier Bridget O'Donnell, Countess of Tyrconnell.â Daughter of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare and Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the Earl of Nottingham. A notable Irish Gaelic poetess of which no previous likenesses are known.\n\nThe portrait at Ingestre Hall Residential Arts Centre is named as âAlathea Talbot (c.1590â1654), Countess of Arundel and Surreyâ by British (English) School, 1619â but that is wrong.\n\nJames Innes-Mulraine tackles this portrait, calling her âa lady formerly called Lady Alathea Talbot Countess of Arundel at Ingestre. By comparison with the contemporary portraits by Daniel Mytens (Arundel Castle and NPG) we can agree that it is probably not Lady Arundelâ¦â\n\nhttps://jamesmulraine.com/2014/03/26/pendants-in-the-name/\n\nIndeed, these are the real Alathea, Countess of Arundel:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Alathea,_Countess_of_Arundel_and_Surrey_by_Daniel_Mytens.jpg\n\nhttps://www.museunacional.cat/sites/default/files/065001-000.JPG\n\nhttps://www.meisterdrucke.uk/kunstwerke/500px/Daniel_Mytens_-_Double_Portrait_of_Thomas_Howard_14th_Collector_Earl_of_Arundel_and_his_wife_Ale_-_{LPARENTHESES} MeisterDrucke-227891).jpg\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Peter_Paul_Rubens_005.jpg/800px-Peter_Paul_Rubens_005.jpg\n\nMulraine suggests the sitter is a possibly Catholic or Catholic sympathiser, by analyzing the jewellery. âFrances Fitzgerald nee Howard, Countess of Kildare, later Frances Brooke, Baroness Cobhamâ was herself no stranger to Catholic-related controversyâher husband was implicated in the âBye Plotâ and âMain Plotâ against James I, the object of which was supposedly religious toleration of Catholics and Puritans. It is not far-fetched to suggest her or a daughter of her were Catholics or heavily Catholic-sympathising, especially as they lived in Ireland.\n\nGoing on the dates on the Ingestre portrait: Aetat 32, 1619, the sitter was born in 1586 or 87.\n\nThe Howard daughters, âElizabeth Stewart nee Howard, Countess of Carrick, earlier Elizabeth Southwellâ and âFrances Fitzgerald nee Howard, Countess of Kildare, later Frances Brooke, Baroness Cobhamâ are too old.\n\nIt is one of their daughters.\n\nOf the daughters of Elizabeth:\n\nElizabeth Southwell is born in âabout 1586â and was the mistress of Sir Robert Dudley, illegitimate son of Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, and they eloped in 1605 and became Roman Catholics in France. By 1613 were in Florence. It COULD be Elizabeth Southwell, but did she come to England? She had thirteen children, and died in Italy in 1631. Probably not.\n\nCatherine, next oldest daughter, was reportedly born around 1600, so itâs not her.\n\nDaughters of Frances Howard:\n\nBridget O'Donnell nee Fitzgerald, Countess of Tyrconnell and wife of Prince Rory O'Donnell, last King of Tyrconnell and 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, later Viscountess Barnewall of Kingsland, from 1616 wife of Nicholas Barnewall, 1st Viscount Barnewall, was born âc. 1589.â\n\nSecond daughter Elizabeth Plunkett nee Fitgerald, Countess of Fingal, died in 1611. So not her.\n\nSo I think it is Brighid Nic Gearailt, Brighid Chill Dara, Lady Bridget Barnewall, Viscountess Kingsland, nee Fitzgerald, earlier Bridget O'Donnell, Countess of Tyrconnell. Daughter of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare and Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the Earl of Nottingham.\n\nShe is said to be âbeautifulâ in the 1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica entry for Rory O'Donnell, her first husband who left Ireland in the Flight of the Earlsâa significant moment in Irish history at the time.\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_EncyclopÃ¦dia_Britannica/O'Donnell\n\nShe is a known poetess. Only one poem survives. Itâs in Gaelic, âResponse to Eochaidh O hEodhasaâs poem,â in the last lines she says: âMy surname will not be heard, until yesterday comes again; my forename, all my know, is shared by a saint in Heaven.â\n\nMaybe her likeness, too, may now be known again.\n\nShe lived on the FitzGerald estates in Kildare until 1619, after which, in England. Both portraits of her are from 1619.\n\nShe would have been 32-ish in the portrait in question, using the Ingestre portrait as a guide. So I think the age on the Ingestre portrait shows that Brighid Nic Gearailt was born in 1586 or 87, not c. 1589 or 90 as commonly stated.\n\n@ Louis Musgrove, regarding the hand: this portrait attributed to Robert Peake certainly piques my interest:\n\nhttp://www.historicalportraits.com/ArtWorkImages/Peake Mary Darrel high res MN572 l.jpg\n\nhttp://www.historicalportraits.com/Gallery.asp?Page=Item&ItemID=1426&Desc=-|-Robert-Peake\n\nExact same composition as the work in question. Awkward left hand with elongated fingers also. Size almost exactly the same also 31 x 24.5 inches this, vs 30 x 24.5 for the unknown portrait.\n\nIt is entirely possible CJ was trying to copy the style of certain aspects of William Larkin also before he advanced out of it then started signing his works.\n\nTherefore I suggest a style transition for Cornelius Johnson:\n\nFrom the artwork in questionâ¦\n\nTo here:\n\nhttp://www.historicalportraits.com/ArtWorkImages/Peake Mary Darrel high res MN572 l.jpg\n\nTo here:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Portrait_of_a_Woman_by_Cornelius_Janssen_van_Ceulen,_1619_-_Cleveland_Museum_of_Art_-_DSC08862.JPG\n\nIf we accept the last one, signed by Cornelius Johnson, is by Cornelius Johnson, then the second one can also clearly be by Cornelius Johnsonâsee the hair, the head, the faceâand it has a dodgy hand. And the painting in question, whose composition (sitter position, angle, lighting, framing, size, etc) is virtually identical to the second work, also has a dodgy hand.\n\nI think we can see progression in the works of Cornelius Johnson, from a style more of emulating others, into one more recognisably his, when he starts signing them.\n\nTherefore, I think the work under discussion is of Brighid Nic Gearailt, Brighid Chill Dara, Lady Bridget Barnewall, Viscountess Kingsland, nee Fitzgerald, earlier Bridget O'Donnell, Countess of Tyrconnell. Daughter of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare and Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the Earl of Nottingham. Poetess. Born 1686 or 87 according to the Ingestre portrait, previously stated to be born c. 1689 or 90. Great-great-granddaughter of Mary Boleyn and possibility Henry VIII. Probably painted by Cornelius Johnson in his early-1619 style, possibly after the death or funeral of Anne of Denmark, queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland, 2nd March (death)--13th May 1619 (funeral).\n\nIf so, it is amazing to have identified two portraits of this poetess and notable figure in Irish history when none were previously known.\n\n@Tim Williams. Thanks for suggesting âwe canât identify a sitter by facial features, or by the art at all, have you tried looking on the back for a name?â or to that effect. If youâd have come in and said that earlier, it would have saved a lot of typing. In fact, using that argument, why is this website even in existence?\n\nIt would be helpful if you could show me any portrait of the time or any time where the sitterâs facial features and earring look as much alike to this and the Ingestre portrait as they do to each other. Please, show me one. Just one.\n\nYou said all portraits of the period look alike, ok, show me it.\n\nLook at the philtrum. (Thatâs the bit in the middle of the upper lip, under the nose).\n\nLook at the lines where the light hits the sides of the bridge of the nose.\n\nDid they overpaint it using this other portrait as a reference? Or might they perchance be of the same person?\n\nIf itâs too small for you to see, find the biggest version you can online, save the image on to your computer, and the same with the image in question, then open them and zoom in closer and directly compare. Thatâs what I did. Sorry if I did wrong by actually looking at the artworks.\n\nThose two portrait sitters are the same person, and they both also have family resemblance to the Howard ladies also, as previously shown â her mother and aunt.\n\nMany portraits of Anne of Denmark look much, much, much more dissimilar from each other in the facial features than these two do to each other, and they are all of Anne of Denmark, and she was the most recognisable woman of the time in England.\n\nSo much for all portraits of the period looking alike.\n\nI am not too worried about the artistâbut then, I havenât been able to take your advice and look for his name on the back. So how can I know? Visual reasoning obviously wonât cut it.\n\nIt does look like other pre-signature works attributed to CJ, so if we canât know about this, if it is âalmost certainly not a painting by Cornelius Johnsonâ then please email all the museums and collections and give them the bad news. Theyâd probably all say â âWhy didnât you tell us this sooner? Where have you been all our lives?â\n\nIâm just working with what Iâve got. I donât believe almost exactly similar composition (sitter position, angle, lighting, framing, size) can be dismissed easily. Odds against far too great.\n\nPlease show me another work of the time definitely by another artist, where the composition is alike to this work in question and the others I have shown where the composition is so alike to it. You canât.\n\nI think these all came out of the same place, and the style in that place changed over time. It could have been one artist, new to London, developing over time.\n\nI donât think art historians or others in the industry generally have high visual aesthetics perception, cognition, appreciation. It is so book-learning and rote-learning heavy, and essays and dissertations to get qualifications, and rote agreeing with earlier people and with gatekeepers brings rewards, or else are technicians, âlook on the back of itâ or âscan it with a machineâ that any high-visual creative perception people are weeded out or would just never enter the field anyway. Thereâs an inverse correlation between both those types of people, which are high trait contentiousness Iâd say, with the barriers to entry and acceptance and success, the gatekeeping, vs high trait openess/creativity/aesthetics people. Iâm not the first to realize it.\n\nHigh trait conscientiousness is directly correlated with success in life, butâ¦ in art perceptionâ¦not necessarily. It is a literal fact to say that not everyone sees the same thing, when looking at the thing, so no point in arguing about that. Like they say about when you read a poem, the poem also reads you.\n\nHer age was around 32, I believe. Sheâs the lady in the Ingestre portrait, same face, same earring.\n\nhttps://artuk.org/discover/artworks/alathea-talbot-c-15901654-countess-of-arundel-and-surrey-20804\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Alathea_Talbot_{LPARENTHESES} Ingestre_Hall_Residential_Arts_Centre).jpg\n\nA famous poet, Brighid Nic Gearailt, great-great-granddaughter of Mary Boleyn and Henry VIII.\n\nEarly-to-mid-1619-ish, I believe. I could be wrong, Iâm just trying my best. Forgive any impudence.\n\n@Tim Williams. Yes, apologies from me. Regarding the works, the ladies are the same person. The works with the same composition were out of the same place, almost certainly. Both points cannot be dismissed out of hand. Iâve said what I wanted to say, above in earlier posts, already anyway.\n\n@Louise Musgrove. Yes, so if Peake was the court painter, our guy could be painting in the style of him initially.\n\nI think the composition --the framing, size in frame, angle, lighting, etc--are crucial. An artistâs style can advance, get better, stop imitating, or stop imitating one and start imitating another, but no-one would mimic the exact same composition of someone else when thereâs no point, and so much variation in composition elsewhere. I think the composition is a house style at that time, in that place. I think itâs early Cornelius Johnson.\n\nI have discovered a previous unidentified portrait of Lady Mary Wroth by the same painter also â same composition, and a dodgy hand:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Circle_of_Robert_Peake_the_Elder_Portrait_of_a_Lady_Wearing_a_Patch.png\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_of_Robert_Peake_the_Elder_Portrait_of_a_Lady_Wearing_a_Patch.png\n\nPreviously called âCircle of Robert Peake the Elder Portrait of a Lady Wearing a Patch.â It is said to be c. 1619-21. Itâs is said to be âwith Strachan Fine Art, London, from 2016.â\n\nIt is her, see portraits of her:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Lady_Mary_Wroth.jpg\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Circle_of_Robert_Peake_the_Elder_Portrait_of_a_Lady_Wearing_a_Patch.png\n\nLady Mary Wroth was a famous poet, as was Brighid Nic Gearailt. I think they were friends. James Multraine was discussing Mary Wroth when he was asking who the sitter in the Ingestre portrait was, due to the location, and discussed another one that I think is Mary Wroth:\n\nhttps://jamesmulraine.com/2014/03/26/pendants-in-the-name/\n\nSo this discovery of the new Mary Wroth painting by me would be a second connection between the two famous poetesses in terms of paintings. Two that James Mulraine was looking at, one of each lady, and two from the same artist, one of which is the artist in question here.\n\nTwo additional descendants of Mary Boleyn were the Essex girls, the sisters of the doomed 2nd Earl. The younger sister Dorothy Devereux married Henry Percy the Wizard Earl of Northumberland, while the elder sister Lady Penelope born a year before Shakespeare, dazzled society with her beauty and elegance. A musical patron, the muse for almost every Elizabethen poet, a superb dancer and singer, and a serious political schemer this Lady was multi talented but her most striking attribute was her astonishing beauty. Some might have known Penelope as the âsecretâ heroine of Sir Philip Sidneyâs poem Stella and Astrophel. Her beauty was of such renown that her portraits were circulated to foreign monarchs including Henri III King of France and King James VI in Scotland.\n\nThere is a double portrait painting of both Devereux sisters in the art collection at Lord Bathâs Longleat House. But there is another portrait of Penelope Devereux, lost for centuries, circulating on Pinterest web sites where it has been incorrectly tagged as the French beauty Marie de Cleves the love interest and close companion of Henri III of France.\n\nThis lost painting was acquired in about 1960 for the collection of the Bowes family in the USA and later moved into storage in an American Museum. Unfortunately no European provenance has survived. Comparing the lady in the Bowesâ picture with the elder sister in the Longleat portrait we clearly get a match. She could be wearing the same dress and the jeweled circlets in her hair are almost identical. The Bowesâ portrait also matches the detailed description of Stella provided by Sir Philip Sidney in his epic poem.\n\nThis painting would have been an ideal subject for an Art Detective investigation if only it had been kept in an English Museum, but it should still be of special interest for the study of Sidneyâs works. This Elizabethan beauty may also have proved to be an inspiration for the playwrights Christopher Marlow and Ben Jonson. We know that in 1604, as an actress, Lady Rich appeared as the âblacked upâ goddess Ocyte for Jonsonâs play the âMasque of Blacknessâ.\n\nThe name and nationality of the paintingâs artist remain unknown. Penelopeâs widowed mother Lettice Knollys had remarried the Earl of Leicester Queen Elizabethâs long standing favourite. Leicester was a great patron of âselfiesâ and renaissance style paintings and this portrait of his step daughter appears to have been made by an artist familiar with Italian techniques. Maybe a modern 16th century Art Detective expert can recognise the painterâs work. Whatever his name he had created the most beautiful likeness since the portrayal of Nefertiti Queen of ancient Egypt.\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.dk/pin/490892428111785645/\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/85137781/penelope-devereux\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/450922981421165113/\n\nReturning to the Colchester and Ipswich painting it appears that although both the Devereux sisters qualify as great grand daughters of Mary Boleyn they can both be discounted in the search for the sitter for this Art UK investigation.\n\nTo summarize regarding this portrait, for ease, everything I have to say:\n\n1. If Cornelius Johnson can imitate van Dyck later he can imitate someone else earlier. No-one can say âthis is clearly not by him.â\n\n2. If the artist did his work right, we might never know who it is by. If CJ can imitate people, when he didnât sign things we probably wonât know who itâs by, as thatâs the point.\n\n3. This Ipswich portrait is very similar to other works attributed to early Cornelius Johnson.\n\n4. If this portrait is proven to not be by CJ then many other portraits attributed to early CJ are not by him either, as they are by the person who painted this and not CJ.\n\n5. The composition of this Ipswich portrait is almost identical to other works attributed to CJ, including signed works (see the size, positioning, angle, lighting, a hand more poorly painted).\n\n6. You can see a progression of the painting style, he may well only have started using the ovals and signing them at a certain point (mid or late 1619?).\n\n7. The sitter is the same person as in the Ingestre portrait, 1619, which is associated with the Arundels, Talbots and Mary Wroth.\n\n8. Mary Wroth was a poetess and so was Bridget Fitzgerald who came to live in England in 1619. Mary Wroth and the Countess of Arundel and people they knew were a large circle of aristocracy, fashionable people, poets and patrons of poets.\n\n9. From early-mid Tudor times onward expensive portraits were recognizable likenesses, even if they have an âInstagram filterâ on. Expensive likenesses are likenesses.\n\n10. The Ipswich and Ingestre sitter has overwhelming likeness to the âHoward ladiesââElizabeth and Frances, who were the daughters of Katherine Howard nee Carey, Countess of Nottingham, Elizabeth 1stâs closest friend in her latter years and her half-niece and half-cousin-once-removed.\n\n11. Using the dates of these ladies and their daughters, the sitter is Bridget Fitzgerald, daughter of Frances Howard.\n\n12. Other portraits associated with the Ingestre portrait sitter have ermine motifs and red and white colour schemes. These are referencing the arms of Barnwell/Barnewell. From her second marriage Bridget was Lady Bridget Barnewall, Viscountess Kingsland.\n\n13. I think the pregnancy portrait that James Mulraine has on his site is the sitter, Bridget, with pregnancy weight gain on her face. She has a red and white dress with ermine motifs.\n\n14. Therefore the work under discussion is of âBridget Fitzgerald,â Brighid Nic Gearailt, Brighid Chill Dara, Lady Bridget Barnewall, Viscountess Kingsland, nee Fitzgerald, earlier Bridget O'Donnell, Countess of Tyrconnell. Daughter of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare and Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the Earl of Nottingham. Poetess. Born 1586 or 87 according to the Ingestre portrait, previously stated to be born c. 1689 or 90. Great-great-granddaughter of Mary Boleyn and Henry VIII. Probably painted by Cornelius Johnson in his early-1619 style, possibly after the death or funeral of Anne of Denmark, queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland, 2nd March (death)--13th May 1619 (funeral).\n\n15. Bridget Fitzgerald was the last Irish Queen in Gaelic Irish culture, her first husband Rory OâDonnell, the last King of Tyconnell. Irish Gaels who didnât accept James I wouldnât have accepted that Rory OâDonnell was âEarl of Tyrconnellâ under James. It is possible that Rory didnât accept, gave lipservice. He later left Ireland in the Flight of the Earlsâthe end of the old Gaelic ruling order.\n\n16. Three newly discovered and identified portraits of the last Queen in Ireland, last Irish Queen, last Gaelic Queen, last Gaelic royal, Queen of Tyrconnell, who was also a famous Gaelic poetess of the time, are very significant to Ireland and the government or a major museum or foundation there or in the US will probably want to buy one or all of them then display with fanfare. This will undoubtedly make the news, and thrill people. Youâre welcome.\n\nIt is indeed difficult, my very thoughts, as I detailed https://www.artuk.org/artdetective/discussions/discussions/is-this-portrait-by-cornelius-johnson-if-not-anne-of-denmark-who-is-the-sitter if an artist didnât want you to know who painted it, as he was imitating more prestigious painters, do you really think you can do better than the artist? Really?\n\nHowever, analysis of the materials used, wood, paint, canvas, anything, might show a consistency to one artist or studio vs another, over time.\n\nJacob, it is not clear that it is not CJ. You are supposed to give evidence and arguments here, not just state things, wrongly.\n\nYou have no idea what CJ painted like in earliest days before he signed them. It is almost exactly like others attributed to CJ and in a progression straight into those he signed.\n\nIf you cant live with the finish being him, then it is a CJ that was studio-of CJ finished by someone else, or was overpainted, or a later copy. Therefore certainly âAfter-an-earlier-style-of-CJ.â\n\nIt is more likely that the same place, same studio or artist kept the compositional style the same (angle, size, placement, lighting, etc) and evolved their painting style, than CJ and another unknown painter had the exact same compositional style for no good reason, when no-one else did.\n\nA CJ with an overpainted face and hand is a CJ with an overpainted face and hand.\n\nIf the work is âclearly not by CJ,â or after his style, youâd better tell the NPG:\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw01515/Sir-Robert-Bruce-Cotton-1st\n\nYou know the people who said that work was CJ or after-CJ at the NPG and who signed off on it from above, but you didnât pipe up then, whatâs changed now?\n\nConsistency would be a start. If you believe what you say, why donât you go through the NPG and redo attribution? Start a little closer to home please.\n\nThis portrait of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton at the NPG, attributed to âCJâ or âafter CJâ is interesting. Why canât they date this? It would be helpful. Is it an original, from what date? Or an original overpainted? What dates? Or a later copy?\n\nIt says â17th-19th century, based on a work of 1629.â How do we know this?\n\nCould our work be similar? So essentially we are both right? The similarities to CJ are not by accident, but it wasnât his hand who finished it?\n\nThe composition of this Sir Robert Bruce Cotton portrait is exactly the same as the work in question, and the ruff the closest Iâve seen. It is almost exactly the same size as the work in question also, 762 mm x 635 mm vs 760mm x 620 mm.\n\nAnd this work is called Cornelius Johnson or after- Cornelius Johnson by the National Portrait Gallery, no less. Youâve probably heard of them.\n\nIf the person who identified that were to read all this talk, theyâd agree with me. So I am not exactly without friends.\n\nAs Iâve said before, the composition is exactly like early CJs, including signed ones.\n\nA generous interpretation would be that CJ was copying this artistâs composition, whoever it wasâbut why? There is no reason. Prestigious Peakeâs or van Somers are not in this composition.\n\nIt is more likely that it is CJâs composition choice, as shows consistency into his signed works. In the years before his more mature CJ style, and before he started signing, he was painting something, trust me. So, what?\n\nIsnât it likely CJ was in the studio or circle of RP, or painted after his style, then evolved his style then started signing then, then later changed again toward Anthony Van Dyck?\n\nOr alternatively a whole raft of early work attributed to CJ before he started signing are not him, but why then is there stylistic consistency into his signed works?\n\nItâs like Ground Hog Day, Iâve said this before, and showed evidence, earlier above in this comment train.\n\nAs Iâve already said, if this is Bridget Fitzgerald by CJ, her cousin Margaret Stuart Mennes has a portrait attributed to CJ, in an oval, almost exactly the same size and composition, and then compare that to a signed CJ oval:\n\nOur sitter:\n\nhttps://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w486h800/collection/SFK/CCM/SFK_CCM_R_1972_61-001.jpg\n\nMargaret Stuart Mennes:\n\nhttps://www.sellingantiques.co.uk/62236/soldportrait-of-lady-margaret-mennes-born-stewart-c1620-attributed-to-cornelius-johnson/\n\nSigned CJ oval (this is not the Countess of Arundel, it is a Barnwell/Barnewell, one of Bridgetâs in-laws from her second marriage, the ermine and red and white is from the arms of Barnewell):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Johnson_{LPARENTHESES} artist)#/media/File:Cornelius_Johnson_-_Portrait_of_a_Woman,_Traditionally_Identified_as_the_Countess_of_Arundel_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nAre you going to say the MSM portrait is not a CJ? Who ever it is, they are rather good, and if you donât think a whole slate of âCJâ-attributed portraits are actually by CJ, you sure took a long time to pipe up about it. Shouldnât you be telling this to all the people who hold them?\n\nLastly, Jacob, with greatest respect, I wouldnât be telling me that I have made a jump too far on something. Most Art Historians are visually-impaired administrators. The whole field is catastrophically misguided. On this very site we had people saying that a portrait that is clearly not Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia was Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, and no one challenged it.\n\nThere is plenty to âhelp us.â Likenesses of mother, portraits of cousin and sister-in-law, other portraits of sitter, importance of sitter established, famous Irish noblewoman and Gaelic poet/daughter of lady important to EI, AoD and Princess Elizabeth, sitter returning to England from Ireland in 1619 therefore portraits would then happen.\n\nI donât want to upset, only to help. Why else would I bother?\n\nPlease be open to the possibility that what I say is correct. Mull it over, ask others, show it to others.\n\nIf two portraits are of the same woman or are clearly someoneâs daughter, there are not enough PhDs, Professorships or Gallery positions in the world to give you the authority or ability to change it.\n\nThere almost certainly isnât documentation to prove it, as else it wouldnât be previously undiscovered before I get there, would it?\n\nThe brat (âbrotâ) or Irish mantle/cloak/shawl is most culturally-identifiable item of Irish clothing ever, worn since prehistory, the Bronze Age. Originally a heavy cloak made of rough wool, it later had lighter fabric and lighter coloured variants for wealthier female wearers. Even wealthy and highest-status Irish people would have worn it, or a variant.\n\nThe brat may not mean a lot to you, but it sure meant a lot to the Irishâand the English, who banned its wearing, as the biggest symbol of Irish cultural identity.\n\nIn Elizabethan times the brat was associated with Irish rebellion fighters â they could be made waterproof, and it is exactly what Irish rebel fighters would have been wearing, out living, moving, hiding and fighting under the elements.\n\nWe donât even have many, or any, good images of it from history, despite it being the most famous Irish cultural clothing item, due to cultural persecution.\n\nIt is going to be hard to see a brat in the painting if youâve no idea what youâre looking for.\n\nhttps://www.tota.world/image/53\n\nhttps://clanmcgrathdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/galloglass-circa-1521.jpg?w=278\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CqsFHBr_QjE/U6KPKuZfHjI/AAAAAAAAAlk/SoC1jB6NrDg/s1600/Irish+Soldiers+and+Farmers%2C+Durer%2C+1521.bmp\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsale_cloak#/media/File:The_Kinsale_Cloak_on_an_Irish_Colleen.jpg\n\nhttps://costumesociety.org.uk/images/uploads/_large/image_2_hynes.jpg\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/43857913.pdf\n\nhttps://saffroncloth.wordpress.com/womens-clothing/brat/\n\nhttps://saffroncloth.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/cheese-mould-hat-2.jpg\n\nBrats later had an edge to themâfurry, or frayed, or different coloured.\n\nIf Bridget Fitzgerald is here wearing a brat, she is wearing a piece of Irish cultural clothing that was banned by her g-g-grandfather, H8.\n\nâno person or persons of what estate, condition or degree they be, shall use, or wear any mantles, cote or hood, made after the Irish fashionâ\n\nIf not a brat mantle she is wearing a wimple-like veil, which was contemporary Irish wear for more highly-placed woman.\n\nThank you Louis for raising the issue of clothing. Very pertinent.\n\nWhat she is wearing over the top and back of her head is in the correct position on the head, in the middle-to-back of the top, that a brat is worn as seen in the few images.\n\nIt looks more to me that she is wearing a veil, which Irish woman of status would have worn, but it is unclear if this Irish veil was essentially just a descendent of the brat that is lighter and worn by wealthy high-class woman.\n\nWhichever it is, this sitter, aside from the ruff and lace cuffs, is not wearing English cultural clothing. She is wearing Irish cultural clothing. Yet she is clearly very wealthy and/or significant â as viewed by the lace.\n\nShe is wearing âgunaâ â Irish womanâs gown, on top of a âleineâ â traditional linen underdress.\n\nhttps://www.shamrockgift.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gaelic_clothing_Ireland-1.jpg\n\nhttps://saffroncloth.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/beaver-hat.jpg\n\nhttps://www.reconstructinghistory.com/images/irelandoise.gif\n\nHer gown is similar to the late-16thC-to-early 17thC âShirone Gown,â see the high waist:\n\nhttps://www.rareirishstuff.com/blog/the-shinrone-gown-.6036.html\n\nIn her clothing Bridget is representing Irish culture.\n\nOh really, my last Gaelic Irish Queen is wearing very expensive lace like a very important person and is wearing the classic elements of Irish dress? I worked out who it was by facial resemblance and dates alone.\n\nHow many other top level nobles with heavy Irish connections, are important enough to paint, or are even in England to be painted, who look ridiculously similar to Frances Howard, Lady Kildare, mother of Bridget Fitzgerald, and whoâs dates/age matches up to the portrait, are there? Bridget Fitzgerald.\n\nIpswich will not need money to restore it, hands should be bitten off in getting to one of the few portraits of the last Gaelic Irish royal and famous Gaelic poetess.\n\nLikeâ¦ a Princess Diana of Irish culture or nationalism. Iconic figure, known for being beautiful, but somewhat of a tragic or sad history, but so many captivating links to history (H8, Mary Boleyn, the Flight of the Earls)."
