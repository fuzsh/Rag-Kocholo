        "text": "This essay offers a new reading of the pose of Anna of Denmark in the hunting portrait, Anne of Denmark (1617) by Paul van Somer. Specifically, it attends to the significance of the queen’s pointed elbow as a marker revealing the precedence of her rank over her gender in the composition of her identity (Fig. 1).1 To evidence this precedence, I will retrace the figural patterns encoded in the imaging of women’s bodies, their elbows akimbo – types, allegories, and portraits – across media such as printed emblems, within paintings, and performances such as the courtly masque.2 These patterns established the norms and paradigms of this portrait’s visual cultural context, a body of images informed by discourses of state, theology, medicine, and natural philosophy, which in turn imprinted the practices of royal portraiture. As Maria H. Loh has observed, Renaissance ‘facial identity was a very nebulous concept in a historical moment before the technological assurances of photographic mimesis and before modern criminologists … systematised the face as the legal guarantor of identity’.3 This essay will read Anna’s elbow akimbo as a marker articulating a notion of likeness and authentic identity legible in the pattern of her elite body, exceeding the particularity of her face.\n\nThis article builds on my recent archival research on Anna’s patronage and political engagement to highlight her importance as a cultural and political figure at the Jacobean court. In 1617, Anna commissioned one of her last ever portraits from the Flemish artist Paul van Somer (c1577-1621) (Royal Collection, London). A close iconographical reading of this portrait is provided, along with a consideration of its original location, and the socio-political context of its commission, in order to reach a unique insight into Anna’s significance, underscoring her cultural interests, factional alignment, and key elements of her wider self-fashioning.\n\nThis article analyses and transcribes an inventory of the wardrobe goods of Anna of Denmark, queen consort of Scotland and England, which was compiled in 1608, and annotated up to and including 1611. The inventory reveals the types of goods that Anna owned, the movement of garments between residences, her involvement in the politicized custom of gift exchange and the concept of her appearance as a point of diplomacy. Arguing that Anna's visual appearance was considered and strategic, it further discredits her narrow and largely negative historiography, which has routinely cast her as a recklessly indulgent and fanciful queen. Anna's tactical visual emulation of Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603), pointed use of recognizable pieces of inherited jewellery and politically significant colours of dress are discussed.\n\nImagery and Objectification: A Study of Early Modern Queenship by Heather Geiter Queen Anne Boleyn (~1507-1536) failed to meet social norms during her time as Queen Consort to Henry VIII (1491-1548). By tracing concepts of queenship through the works of Chrétien de Troyes, Andreas Capellanus, Thomas Malory, and Juan Luis Vives this thesis demonstrates how Anne united the office of queen and mistress to bring her downfall and introduce a new construct of queenship. 3 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
