        "text": "About the Artist\n\nSimone Leigh was born in Chicago, Illinois, and currently lives in Brooklyn, New York. Leigh’s art explores race, gender, and history with a focus on the female form and Black female identity.\n\nAbout the Art\n\nThe female figure in Corrugated sits on top of a base that might be interpreted as a skirt or an abstracted body. The curved and ridged base references industrial architecture, a recurring theme in Leigh’s work.\n\nLook Closely\n\nWhat materials does it look like the artist uses in this sculpture? What do you think the materials would feel like?\n\nWhat parts of the sculpture remind you of things you can see in real life? What parts seem less realistic?\n\nDiscuss\n\nIn discussing her work Simone Leigh says, “I just like the idea of thinking about femininity in a different way, as something solid and enduring rather than always something fragile and weak.”\n\nHow does our society define or characterize femininity? How does Corrugated reflect this desire to redefine femininity outside of dominant societal norms?\n\nReflect\n\nThe materials in this sculpture have a strong association with place (raffia with Africa and African art; corrugated tubing with urban construction sites). How do you think the artist is connecting identity and place? How does place shape our identities? Is the place where you’re from part of your personality? Or do you feel at odds with where you live? Why or why not?\n\nLearn More\n\nVisit the “Learn More” sidebar to find more information about the work of art and artist and find other works of art that relate to the subject matter, media, and techniques used by the artist."
