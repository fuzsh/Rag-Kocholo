The image, captured by J. Thomson in the 19th century, provides a glimpse into the life and work of this influential figure. Van Somer's artistic talent flourished under the patronage of King James I, who greatly valued his skills. This steel engraving from Edward Walmsley's \"Physiognomical Portraits\" highlights Van Somer's distinct features - his intense gaze, refined ruff collar adorned with delicate lace, and a goatee that adds an air of sophistication to his countenance. Born in Antwerp but finding fame in England, Van Somer played a pivotal role in shaping the art scene at the royal court. His paintings reflected both his Flemish roots and English influences, creating a unique blend that captivated audiences. This historical artwork not only captures Van Somer's likeness but also serves as a testament to his significant contributions to art history during this period. It stands as an enduring reminder of his talent and influence within both regency circles and beyond.
