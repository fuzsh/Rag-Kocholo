Wikipedia\n\t\n\tBorn: 19 February 1594, Stirling Castle, Stirling\n\tDied: 6 November 1612, City of Westminster\n\tPlace of burial: Westminster Abbey, London\n\tHouse: House of Stuart\n\tSiblings: Charles I of England, Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, Robert Stuart, Duke of Kintyre and Lorne\n\tParents: James VI and I, Anne of Denmark\n\t\n\tHenry was created Prince of Wales at Westminster in June 1610, the paragon of a prince: he was intelligent, well read, an excellent swordsman, an avid patron of the arts, and possessed of a strict sense of morality. \n\t\n\tHenry was also a stout Protestant—when his father proposed a French marriage, he answered that he was 'resolved that two religions should not lie in his bed.'1  He was very approving of his sister Elizabeth's proposed match to the Protestant Frederick, Elector Palatine.   Henry was the great hope of the Protestants, who saw in him a Protestant Henry V who would lead troops to the continent on a crusade against Catholic Spain.  Others thought that a fertile time in the arts would take place at the court of the future King Harry. \n\t\n\tThese dreams were shattered in November 1612, when Henry suddenly took ill and died, probably of typhoid fever, though rumors circulated that the Prince was poisoned.  Always most fond of his little sister Elizabeth, his last words on his deathbed are said to have been “where is my dear sister?”  Henry's untimely death occasioned national mourning.\n\t\n\tIt is difficult to gauge the extent to which English and European history would have been different, had Henry lived.  It is possible that the well-informed Protestant prince, once king, would have adopted policies agreeable to the Parliament, keeping it in voluntary submission to the Crown, thereby preventing entirely the English Civil War, in which Henry's younger brother, as King Charles I, lost his head.\n\t<a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/princehenry.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/princehenry.htm</a>",
