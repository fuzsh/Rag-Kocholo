        "text": "I can tell you with absolute confidence that it is not Anne of Denmark, as the sitter doesnât have the face of Anne of Denmark. That would probably be the minimum requirement. Saying that, some famous portraits that noted people in the industry think are of AoD are not of AoD, so there is massive confusion. So, in that climate, I forgive.\n\nEvery female portrait would be called AoD if they could be, just like any was of EI, as they are the most prestigious and valuable sitters.\n\nIt is not Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, either.\n\nIt does look a bit like a few portraits of ESQB, at a distance, however looks nothing like her in most ESQB portraits, and if you zoom in on the faces of the portraits that do look like her because of the light hair, itâs not the sitter, itâs ESQB.\n\nhttps://www.rct.uk/collection/400094/elizabeth-queen-of-bohemia-1596-1662\n\nhttps://www.rct.uk/collection/404015/elizabeth-queen-of-bohemia-1596-1662\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw02090/Princess-Elizabeth-Queen-of-Bohemia-and-Electress-Palatine\n\nThe sitter is not ESQB.\n\nI believe the sitter is Lady Elizabeth Cecil nee Egerton, Countess of Exeter.\n\nIt does look like some works said to be Paul Van Somer, and could well be Cornelius Johnson. It is an oval, and CJ did ovals from 1619 onward, but heâd paint the oval in, on a rectangular standard canvas, and often sign and date them on the bottom right of the oval. This has been cut away from the oval, perhaps to remove the CJ signature and date which would have indicated that this canât be AoD, as the sitter is clearly too young to be AoD in 1619, the year she died and that CJ started using ovals.\n\nI donât think there is a single Paul Van Somer oval painting that anyone has ever said is âby PVSâ it is always âafter PVSâ or âcircle of PVS.â That suggests PVS didnât do ovals, but someone in his style did. Cornelius Johnson did ovals.\n\nThe sitter is high on the canvas for a CJ, who is known for sittersâ heads being lower. The âPVSâ oval paintings sit very low in the frame for PVS â so I think theyâre CJ.\n\nThe portrait could well be mid or late 1619.\n\nOn Lady Elizabeth Cecil nee Egerton, Countess of Exeter:\n\nHer parents, John Egerton and Lady Frances Stanley married on 27 June 1602, her date of birth might be 1604, making her about fifteen in this 1619 portrait, which is marriage age at the time. She is their eldest child.\n\nHer father was Lord President and Lord Lieutenant of Wales and the Marches.\n\nHer mother was the second daughter of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, and her aunt Anne Brydges nee Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven, was legally Queen according to H8âs will, the legality of Katherine Greyâs sons not having been proven.\n\nIn 1826 no more descendents of Anne are recorded as living, so the claim passes to Frances Stanleyâs line, so we are retroactively looking at a Princess, according to law, according to some, and called Elizabeth, so itâs curious that people were thinking it is Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia.\n\nHere is a portrait of her father, John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater, from â1617-19â by âPVS or CJâ. I think it is another 1619 oval by CJ. It is a clear companion to the piece in question, same artist probably.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/John-Egerton1.jpg\n\nhttp://images.ntpl.org.uk/hppa-zooms/00000000712/cms_pcf_1298206.bro\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Egerton,_1st_Earl_of_Bridgewater#/media/File:John-Egerton1.jpg\n\nHere is a portrait said to be of âLady Frances Stanley,â her mother, c. 1619 by PVS. The resemblance is massive, it could be the same person as our sitter, if not for the receding hair indicating age:\n\nhttp://www.gogmsite.net/_Media/ca-1619-lady-frances-stanle-2.jpeg\n\nhttp://www.gogmsite.net/the_late_farthingale_era_fr/ca-1619-lady-frances-stanle.html\n\nDaughter, father, mother. If you whacked the three in one of those computer programs that can determine family relation via face analysis, itâd come out right.\n\nHere is her son, John Cecil, 4th Earl of Exeter, of which there is quite a resemblance to our sitter, too:\n\nhttps://collections.burghley.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/min0022.jpg\n\nhttps://collections.burghley.co.uk/collection/john-4th-earl-of-exeter-1628-1678-by-john-hoskins-signed-with-initials-and-dated-1647/\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Portrait_of_a_Man,_Said_to_Be_John_Cecil_{LPARENTHESES} 1628â1678),_Fourth_Earl_of_Exeter_MET_57101.jpg\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_of_a_Man,_Said_to_Be_John_Cecil_{LPARENTHESES} 1628â1678),_Fourth_Earl_of_Exeter_MET_57101.jpg\n\nOur sitterâs brother, through which a royal claim passes:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Portrait_of_John_Edgerton_2nd_Earl_of_Bridgewater.jpg\n\nHere is our sitter and her daughter, Lady Frances Cecil, who married Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, or else a close relative of her, heavy resemblance to the sitter:\n\nhttp://www.artnet.com/artists/paul-van-somer/portrait-of-a-lady-and-child-anne-viscountess-rAs4iynLds8OARbig-6Qxg2\n\nIs this a relative of our sitter also, âc.1619â?:\n\nhttp://www.artnet.com/artists/robert-peake-the-elder/portrait-of-a-lady-said-to-be-mary-queen-of-scots-hty75P64H8upzE6ON9a1BQ2\n\nhttp://www.historicalportraits.com/Gallery.asp?Page=Item&ItemID=1426&Desc=-|-Robert-Peake\n\nHer cousins are the Egerton sisters:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Vere,_Mary_and_Elizabeth_Egerton_{LPARENTHESES} l-r),_1601.jpg\n\nhttp://www.historicalportraits.com/Gallery.asp?Page=Item&ItemID=1198&Desc=Portrait-of-the-Egerton-Sisters-by--English-School-c.1600\n\nThis may well be Vere Booth nee Egerton, the eldest of the sitterâs three Egerton cousins from the above portrait:\n\nhttp://www.artnet.com/artists/robert-peake-the-elder/portrait-of-a-lady-lady-anne-cecil-daughter-of-_vHrntZQGhR0ZevgC4nnRQ2\n\nhttps://pixels.com/featured/portrait-of-a-lady-possibly-lady-anne-cecil-robert-peake.html\n\nThis sure looks like our sitter or a relative also, rather than being Elizabeth Knollys, nÃ©e Howard (1586â1658), Viscountess Wallingford, Later Countess of Banbury, as purported:\n\nhttps://cdn.simplesite.com/i/a0/53/282600884351685536/i282600889670141634._szw1280h1280_.jpg\n\nhttps://www.katherinethequeen.com/442801628\n\nIt is likely this is one of her relatives if not her, and not Lady Ann Morton as stated:\n\nhttps://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03033_10.jpg\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/British_School_17th_century_-_Portrait_of_Anne_Wortley,_Later_Lady_Morton_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:British_School_17th_century_-_Portrait_of_Anne_Wortley,_Later_Lady_Morton_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\nhttps://artuk.org/discover/artworks/portrait-of-anne-wortley-later-lady-morton-198019\n\nhttps://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/unknown-artist-britain-portrait-of-anne-wortley-later-lady-morton-t03033\n\nSuch a sumptuous portrait, that dress like treacle.\n\nIn terms of provenance, there is a connection between my sitter and the Earl of Mar and Kellie.\n\nHer only daughter, Frances Cooper nee Cecil, was Countess of Shaftesbury.\n\nSusan Violet Ashley-Cooper (1868- 1938), daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury (1831- 1886), married Walter John Francis Erskine, 12th Earl of Mar and Kellie (1865- 1955) in 1892.\n\nhttps://www.ornaverum.org/images/erskine/portrait-18-large.jpg\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp124211/susan-violet-erskine-nee-ashley-cooper-countess-of-mar-and-kellie\n\nMaybe this lady, descended from the Earls of Shaftsbury, marrying into Scottish aristocracy, the Earls of Mar and Kellie, brought this portrait, as, if thought to be AoD, it was of the Queen of Scotland, wife of James VI and I, the Queen at the pivotal point of the union of the crowns.\n\nIf thatâs not plausible, nothing is.\n\nTo conclude: the artist is very probably Cornelius Johnson, mid to late 1619 perhaps, and it probably got cut out and away from the signature and date, and the sitter is Elizabeth Cecil, Countess of Exeter, although there are a group of relatives who look alike. Her daughter married into the Earls of Shaftsbury, of which a late-Victorian descendent married into the Earlâs of Mar and Kellie, of which the current Earl is the owner of the work.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\nHope everyone is doing ok regarding the pandemics and lockdowns. Such a hard time for so many.\n\n@Jacob, thanks for that. In a discussion on a previous work https://www.artuk.org/artdetective/discussions/discussions/who-might-be-the-artist-of-this-portrait-and-the-sitter-portrayed I go into massive discussion like you wouldnât believe, on how, judging by the work attributed to him, CJ didnât start off painting like the mid-to-later CJ.\n\nIf he could imitate Van Dyck later, he can imitate other people earlier, and if he didnât sign them, then we may not know, as we werenât supposed to know, thatâs the point, he can imitate.\n\nHe did do ovals, however. We have signed ovals, and a progression of style from whatâs said to be early CJ, to signed ovals by him, where legacy of that style remains, into later style CJ ovals. Then he stops signing, and, it is said, imitates Van Dyck later, so that some Van Dycks may not actually be by Van Dyck.\n\nIf from 1615 however, CJ wasnât supposed to be around then, so if thatâs provably correct, it makes early unsigned CJs unsafe, and suggests CJ started doing ovals because of imitating this other person.\n\nIf from 1615, I revise my assessment of the sitter to be Lady Frances Egerton nee Stanley, Countess of Bridgewater, who is the lady in this âc. 1619 by PVSâ work:\n\nhttp://www.gogmsite.net/_Media/ca-1619-lady-frances-stanle-2.jpeg\n\nhttp://www.gogmsite.net/the_late_farthingale_era_fr/ca-1619-lady-frances-stanle.html\n\nShe would be 32 in 1615.\n\nIf itâs her, the portrait of her husband is a companion to it: âJohn Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater,â from â1617-19â by âPVS or CJâ:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/John-Egerton1.jpg\n\nhttp://images.ntpl.org.uk/hppa-zooms/00000000712/cms_pcf_1298206.bro\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Egerton,_1st_Earl_of_Bridgewater#/media/File:John-Egerton1.jpg\n\nHowever the piece in question is oval, CJ did ovals, and no earlier than 1619 that we know, and it is very similar to other CJ 1619 ovals:\n\nHere is a portrait said to be of the âCountess of Exeterâ c. 1620, by âCornelius Janssen van Ceulenâ (Cornelius Johnson) at the Milwaukee Art Museum. In reality, it is one of the previous Countess of Exeterâs daughters, and Elizabeth Cecil nee Edgerton was the next Countess of Exeter, so this sitter here could be her sister-in-law:\n\nhttps://i2.wp.com/blog.mam.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/r_m1989_68_001.jpg\n\nhttps://blog.mam.org/2017/10/24/from-the-collection-the-countess-of-exeter-by-cornelius-janssen-van-ceulen/\n\nIf the work in question is 1619 or 1620, it is Elizabeth Cecil nee Egerton, and this other work above is a companion piece, sister-in-laws, the daughter of the earlier Countess of Exeter.\n\nIf this work in question is 1615, it is Frances Egerton nee Stanley, Countess Bridgewater, the mother of my first suggestion, and it calls into question what we know about other works attributed to early Cornelius Johnson, and who started doing oval portraits and when.\n\nThanks.\n\n@ Thanks Jacob. Resemblance seemed to be enough for many people when they got the resemblance clearly wrong. When I tell you correctly, suddenly it is not enough.\n\nI never said resemblance was necessarily enough or the only thing, but it gets you in a very close ballpark, and sure obliterates obvious mistakes of misidentification.\n\nI said it looked so much like the mother it could have been the mother. It is one or the other. If it looks like portraits of a personâs father, mother, cousins, brother, son, then, hey, I do my best. But then suddenly âresemblance is not enough.â Before I showed you this, misidentification of the resemblance seemed to be enough.\n\nAnd, to correct you, resemblance may well be enough, if you put the faces in one of these computer programs to identify relations. Obviously the faces are not photographs in a passport-photo type position, but you get an expert to put the computer dots on the face from what can be seen, that then analyses the spacing and relationship between. If it comes back 80% likelihood that x is the daughter of y and 80% that it is the mother of z, itâs her. That is a 96% chance of being her, by an unbiased AI face analysis that has been taught what is correct in familial relationships. Sorry to go all 21st Century, but that is where we are. I guess Iâm talking about a revolution that hasnât happened yet.\n\nIâve always had a bit of a problem with provenance, as if for example a painting is burgled out of one house then sold to another collection, that doesnât mean the artwork is of someone else, just because of mistaken or lying provenance, when most people canât even see with their eyes that the sitter is not Anne of Denmark or Elizabeth Stuart, Queen Bohemia.\n\nI thought my link from family to family was rather spiffing, so perhaps someone can wake up the great Earl, and get him to tell his people to ask their people. Iâm sure heâd be interested in a portrait of his relativeâeither the mother, who the royal claim to the Earls of Jersey goes through, or her daughter, his ancestor who married into the Cecils of Exeter.\n\nTo be frank I consider talk of the artist of a work a total moot point, but canât have failed to notice how people in the industry, highly-educated, in the standard mindset, are crazy about it, to the point of not having an eye for who the sitter actually is or sometimes seemingly not hardly even actually caring.\n\nIt is a moot point as, artists imitated others, wanted you to think it was by another, customers would have wanted that also. As Van Dyck was known to do, it is likely earlier major artists had studios where others did the basic painting, then the master came in and finished them off. They would have understudies, apprentices, that is how later masters and names learnt. If there was a rush, and the lesser man finished one off, is that by the same, or different, or both, or does it really matter?\n\nAnd big names, with styles, werenât born into the world with that later mature style. Sometimes you will know your attribution is correct, because everyone else tells you youâre wrong, and you are talking about a less mature style, or an imitation of another style. What really does it then matter? You have to be officially called wrong to be right, so why bother?\n\nI know there is money in âwho painted it,â but there is therefore money in false authentications. Iâve heard respected people saying they know that big name big money authenticators lie for the money. So who, exactly, are we wasting braincells in trying to please? Liars?\n\nThere is money in actually knowing the sitter, I feel, but that takes eyeballs.\n\nI am concerned about the identity of the sitter, and if people are related they look alike, I donât want to shock anyone.\n\nI think the sitters would want their true likeliness to be known.\n\nThere is a spiritual component in finding and revealing to the world the true likeliness of a previous human\n\n@Jacob. I hear what you say.\n\nI feel I have an insight that artists are not making up facial features. I am aware of the fashions. I never look at makeup and costume. Hair tends to stay in a ballpark, however, I have noticed, generally speaking, with some exceptions.\n\nI have noticed portraits of EI and MI were painted to look more like H8 in the face, but aside from that, canât say Iâve seen anyone being painted more like anyone for any reason. No-one else is important enough to paint anyone like. Being a true-ish likeness, so resembling your parents or grandparents and your children, is quite important, wouldnât you say? The hair does copy the Queens, however. EI, and AoD. Suddenly many people have hair like the current queen.\n\nIâve said this often: expensive likenesses are a likeness. I didnât get taught otherwise, and Iâm not having it, I eyeball it.\n\nEven if there is an âInstagram filterâ on the portrait, smoothing it out in a disorientating way, there is a sitter behind, as with Instagram.\n\nI think that where you think people are unrecognizable because of different artists, I say people are always recognizable, but there are a raft of misidentified artworks.\n\nTo illustrate: people were honestly signing off publicly on this portrait in question being AoD or ESQD! But thatâs nothing compared to some.\n\nIâm recognizing faces like I would in real life. I feel that if I can see relatives, and the computers can do it with a high % accuracy on photos of humans, then it is inevitable for portraits, eventually. I think the vibe will clearly be that the industry doesnât want it!\n\nFrom my experience facial featured are identifiable. So much so that I ask people â so, did this artist use this other random person as a model in how to mispaint someone, or are they both portraits of the same person, perchance? Occamâs razor. Itâs like hearing perfect pitch in music. Not everyone can do it. I never said I had perfect pitch, however.\n\nPerhaps it is truly rare for someone to come in and tell art historians who have been taught they canât tell by looks, and probably canât tell by looks, that I can tell by looks, and then be brave enough to say whatâs what. Itâs a real benefit of these message boards and the art detective concept, crowd-sourcing it. In real life Iâd never be let near."
