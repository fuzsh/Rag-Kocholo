        "text": "Anne of Denmark (born Dec. 12, 1574—died March 2, 1619) was the queen consort of King James I of Great Britain and Ireland (James VI of Scotland); although she had little direct political influence, her extravagant expenditures contributed to the financial difficulties that plagued James’s regime.\n\nThe daughter of King Frederick II of Denmark and Norway, Anne was married to James in 1589. Her Lutheran upbringing and frivolous nature cost her the affection of James’s Scottish Presbyterian subjects, and James alienated Anne by entrusting the upbringing of their first son, Prince Henry (1594–1612), to John Erskine, 2nd earl of Mar. Nevertheless, after James ascended the British throne in 1603, he and Anne lived in harmony, although they had separate quarters during the last few years of her life. Most of the Queen’s time and energy were devoted to lavish court entertainments, and her patronage contributed to the development of the arts, particularly of the masque. She embarrassed James, however, with her conversion to Roman Catholicism. Their second son succeeded James as King Charles I (ruled 1625–49)."
