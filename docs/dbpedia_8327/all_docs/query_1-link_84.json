        "text": "No painter has done more to define an era than Anthony van Dyck. His portraits of King Charles I, Queen Henrietta Maria and the courtiers who surrounded them are images of regal majesty, gilded youth and feminine beauty. They evoke an age of sumptuous costume and cultivated ease. The feelings they arouse are similar to those produced by yellowing snapshots of young men and women enjoying the long, hot summer of 1914. All this colour and languid elegance was shortly to be swept away in a bloody war, which would slaughter many of the men, widow the women, bring down the whole edifice of divine-right monarchy and culminate in the public execution of that same ruler whom Van Dyck had represented as a Christlike figure, a loving father and husband, and the epitome of dignity and melancholy sensitivity.\n\nNowadays, when we expect no more of royal painters than we do of poets laureate, it seems strange to think of the monarchy as the driving force behind the cultural avant garde. But the new exhibition at Tate Britain convincingly shows that Charles I's patronage of the Flemish painter created a revolution in British portrait painting whose reverberations continued to be felt well into the 20th century.\n\nVan Dyck spent only seven and a half years of his short life (1599-1641) in England. He grew up in Antwerp, where his precocious talent was recognised by Peter Paul Rubens, the greatest painter of the age. He worked in Rubens's studio and imitated his style as a religious artist, painting biblical scenes redolent of the lush piety of the counter-reformation. But soon he was on the move. In 1620, he visited London for a few months, long enough to paint a history picture, The Continence of Scipio, for the royal favourite, George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham, and a portrait of his other English patron, the great art collector Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel.\n\nHe spent most of the next five years in Italy, chiefly in Genoa, making imposing portraits of the wealthy aristocracy of that city in their sombre palazzi. In Venice he indulged his passion for Titian, whose works he sketched, copied and, when possible, added to his own personal art collection. He returned to the Spanish Netherlands in 1627, becoming court artist to Archduchess Isabella, painting great religious and mythological canvases and producing some of his finest portraits. Restless as ever, he departed in 1631 to The Hague to paint the Dutch ruler Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, before accepting Charles I's invitation in 1632 to come to England. By this time he was recognised as the leading court painter in Europe, with Velázquez at the court of Philip IV of Spain his only rival. He also excelled as a superbly observant painter of children and (even more appealing to the English nobility) dogs.\n\nIn London Van Dyck was knighted, paid an annual pension of £200 and installed in a house at Blackfriars, with a special jetty at which the royal barge might tie up when Charles I was visiting his studio. Yet he had no intention of settling there for good. His second English period was interrupted by a year-long visit to Antwerp and Brussels, where he did some of his best work; and he spent the last year of his life feverishly travelling to Flanders and Paris, which he had hoped would be his next destination.\n\nVan Dyck was a small man, expensively dressed and with courtly manners. He lived in great style, keeping horses, carriages and a retinue of servants. Well accustomed to painting grandees, he was socially at ease with his royal and aristocratic patrons. He worked all day and his output was prodigious. He had a crowded appointment book and gave his sitters only an hour at a time, during which he made a preliminary sketch in crayon and painted the face. His assistants then filled in the outline on the canvas, and painted the clothes (provided by the sitter), while Van Dyck saw to the head and the hands, the latter taken from one of the models, male and female, whom he kept for that purpose. When his assistants had done their bit, the master would add the finishing touches. In this way he was able to work on several portraits at the same time and to complete them at the rate of roughly one a week.\n\nThere had been some good Netherlandish painters at the English court before him. But even the best royal portraits by Paul van Somer and Daniel Mytens appeared stiff and awkward by the side of Van Dyck's dashingly fluid and energetic work, with its delicate flesh tones, graceful postures and shimmering drapery. Van Dyck brought emotion, movement and psychological insight. For sheer bravura he was unmatched. Mytens, his predecessor as royal painter, was totally eclipsed and went back to Holland.\n\nVan Dyck introduced new genres into English painting: groups of children without their parents; \"friendship portraits\" of pairs of men or women; Titianesque poses of the ruler on horseback, the hunter with his loyal dog or the statesman with his attentive secretary; allegorical pictures of aristocrats posing as figures in pagan or Christian mythology or clad in the costume of pastoral romance; portraits of men and women against a background of curtains, classical columns, bare rocks or wild landscape, each carrying a different symbolic meaning.\n\nA haberdasher's son, Van Dyck was intensely interested in clothes. His English portraits of women often show a preference for informal dress: loose shifts, flowing drapery, open necks, bare bosoms and uncovered lower arms (so much quicker to paint than intricate lace collars and cuffs, and also more titillating - the bare arm, it has been said, was to the 1630s what the ankle was to the Victorians). This was what the poet Herrick meant by \"a sweet disorder in the dress\"; no one represented that liquefaction of the clothes better than Van Dyck. He loved exotic costumes, such as the \"Persian\" dress in which he painted Sir Robert and Lady Shirley, or the Indian pyjamas worn by the oriental traveller William Feilding, Earl of Denbigh. Many of his subjects wear fantasy costume, derived from the court masques of the 1630s. Van Dyck was the first \"that e're put ladies' dress into a careless romance\".\n\nIt is unlikely that Van Dyck did all this portrait painting by choice. In the accepted artistic hierarchy, portraits ranked far lower than scenes from history, mythology and the Bible. But there was no demand in Protestant England for altarpieces, though he did some religious pictures for the queen, and for his Catholic friend Sir Kenelm Digby. It was said that he produced some other historical paintings, but they have left no record. A grisaille, depicting the king and the garter knights in procession, recalls his never-completed plan for four large tapestries for the Banqueting House in Whitehall. His topographical drawings and landscape watercolours, of which a few survive, are remarkably impressive; and anticipate the great English tradition of Sandby, Girtin and Cotman. But the king's failure to commission from him any large figure paintings, other than the ravishing Cupid and Psyche, strikes modern connoisseurs as a major failure to appreciate where Van Dyck's greatest talents lay.\n\nCharles I had amassed the best royal art collection in Europe, and his feeling for the visual arts was genuine. But, as the historian Kevin Sharpe makes clear in his chapter in the exhibition catalogue, his artistic patronage was more political in intention than aesthetic. Van Dyck depicted the little, stammering king as a superior being, whether confidently mounted on the great horse like a Roman emperor, sitting benignly among his young family or standing relaxed in the hunting field. His images of the royal family project the values of peace, harmony, marital love, paternal concern and dynastic fruitfulness. They imply that Charles's right to rule stemmed as much from his innate superiority as from his coronation and legitimate descent.\n\nSimilarly Van Dyck's portraits of the aristocracy are meant to prove that true nobility stemmed from virtue rather than birth. The younger men exude an aura of elegance and refinement, the older ones self-control and moral strength. As for the women, Charles liked their faces to be \"as beautiful as may be\"; and their figures \"gracious and svelta\". The theory of platonic love, much in vogue at the queen's court, gave beauty a moral value. It was the symbol of virtue, a ladder for the heavenly ascent of the soul. The queen's niece, who knew her aunt only from Van Dyck's portraits, was astonished to discover that Henrietta Maria was a very small woman, with crooked shoulders, long skinny arms and protruding teeth. The Countess of Sussex was one of very few of Van Dyck's sitters to complain that her own portrait had not done her justice: \"the face is so big and so fat that it pleases me not at all\".\n\nThe men who wielded real power in the 1630s were treated more realistically. Van Dyck painted Titianesque portraits of the intense, brooding figure of Sir Thomas Wentworth, the king's strongman in Ireland, and an unadorned image of Archbishop William Laud, that \"little low red-faced man\", with his piercing gaze and air of impatient authority. This was the picture that in October 1640 fell from Laud's study wall, the string having broken. \"God grant this be no omen,\" he entered in his diary. Two months later he was impeached for treason.\n\nMany of Van Dyck's subjects became leaders of the parliamentary side in the civil war, and in appearance are indistinguishable from their royalist opponents. They included the earls of Bedford, Warwick, Northumberland, for whom Van Dyck rather surprisingly painted an elaborate crucifixion, and Pembroke, whose family is the subject of the magnificent group painting at Wilton House. One of Van Dyck's most subtle portraits is widely believed to be of Sir Thomas Chaloner, who was a signatory to Charles I's death warrant. The English aristocracy were divided in the civil war, but these portraits suggest that previously they had shared a remarkably homogeneous culture.\n\nThe king spent more on clothes in a single year than he paid Van Dyck throughout his time in England. As a way of sustaining the royal image, paintings were remarkably cheap by comparison with the other accoutrements of regal magnificence, such as jewellery, gold plate and tapestries. The great royal portraits were hung to dramatic effect at the end of long vistas in the royal palaces at St James's, Whitehall and Hampton Court. Only courtiers, foreign ambassadors and distinguished visitors could see them there, but Van Dyck's studio was kept busy manufacturing replicas to be distributed as gifts to the king's friends and to foreign rulers. Copies of Van Dyck's work proliferated: there are more than 50 versions of his Archbishop Laud alone, and his images were multiplied many times over in miniature paintings, enamels, etchings and engravings.\n\nThe exhibition at Tate Britain has a double purpose: to explore Van Dyck's impact on the England of his own day; and to trace his influence on British painting in subsequent centuries. It would be unreasonable to expect definitive treatment of either of these large themes. Five of the 133 items listed in the exhibition will not be exhibited. Among them, alas, are the enchanting portraits of Nicholas Lanier, master of the king's music, and Philip, Lord Wharton, in an Arcadian setting. Of the remainder, only 57 are by the artist himself, significantly fewer than were displayed in the National Portrait Gallery's exhibition Van Dyck in England in 1982. Many of the artist's most spectacular English achievements are absent - notably, Charles I in the Hunting Field, the most imaginative of all the royal portraits. By way of compensation, there are some relatively unfamiliar exhibits. The portrait of Anne Kirke from the Huntington in California is particularly fine; and from the Prado come the double portrait of Van Dyck with his friend, the courtier and connoisseur Endymion Porter, and the picture of the artist's wife, Mary Ruthven, with her \"inticing Italianed eyes, able to confound a saint\".\n\nIn its publicity, the Tate claims, on the basis of very slender evidence, that Van Dyck was personally involved with Katherine, Lady Stanhope, whose portrait will also be shown. \"Van Dyck's lover to go on display,\" proclaimed BBC News. It would have been better to focus the tabloids' attention on the artist's mistress, Margaret Lemon (was that really her name, one wonders: \"lemon\" was the old English term for \"lover\"). She was probably the model for the stunningly erotic nude in Cupid and Psyche, bearing out the remark of a contemporary writer on art that her face was the least beautiful part of a beautiful woman: \"though she hath a fair face beyond nature, yet putting off her clothes [she] seemeth to have no face at all, in regard of the other excellencies that were concealed\".\n\nVan Dyck died just when the Long Parliament was beginning to dismantle Charles I's regime. His art failed to save the king and may even have been counterproductive. In Protestant eyes, this devout Catholic was an idolater who painted female Catholic converts wearing crosses in their bosoms. At a time when the queen's Catholic faction at court was coming into the open, it was easy to see him as part of a popish plot to return England to Rome. In the 1640s, his image of Archbishop Laud was put to satirical use by Puritan cartoonists, and the elegant costumes of his courtly sitters taken as proof of royalist decadence. After the king's defeat, his wonderful art collection was put up for sale and his Van Dycks dispersed all over Europe.\n\nYet though Van Dyck could not prevent Charles's fall, he contributed powerfully to the cult of Charles the Martyr. The Commonwealth regime dismally failed to establish an alternative artistic style. Cromwell's chief portrait painter, Robert Walker, shamelessly painted parliamentarian heads on top of Van Dyckian bodies and based his portrait of the protector on Van Dyck's Wentworth. The engraver Pierre Lombart even reworked the magnificent Charles I on Horseback with M de St Antoine by substituting Cromwell's head for that of the king.\n\nFor the next 300 years, Van Dyck was the major influence on English portraiture. In his portraits of the sultry beauties of the Restoration court, Charles II's court painter Peter Lely followed Van Dyck's practice of painting women in loose undress, though without Van Dyck's allegorical dimension. The Restoration etcher Richard Gaywood reworked a print of Van Dyck's Margaret Lemon into a supposed portrait of Nell Gwyn. William III's court painter Godfrey Kneller based his portrait of the monarch on Van Dyck's Charles I in Robes of State\n\nThe mid-18th century witnessed the vogue of so-called \"Vandyke\" dress: loose shifts worn over chemises for women, with ribbons and rosettes; plain satin suits for men, with lace collars and cuffs. When Horace Walpole went to a masquerade in 1742, he saw \"quantities of Vandykes, and all kinds of old pictures walked out of their frame\". The drapery painter Joseph van Aken specialised in adding Van Dyck costumes to heads drawn by provincial artists. When the Dean of York got married in 1749, he and his bride were painted by Joseph Highmore wearing Van Dyck dress.\n\nNearly all the great 18th-century portraitists, from Pompeo Batoni and Allan Ramsay to Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, copied Van Dyck's costumes, poses and compositions. Johan Zoffany's group portrait of George III and his family was such a melange of Vandyckian motifs that Walpole thought it \"ridiculous\". The most famous of these imitations, Gainsborough's Blue Boy, taken from Van Dyck's George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Lord Francis Villiers, will not be on display at the Tate, but there are to be many other examples of Van Dyck's continuing influence, particularly on \"swagger\" portraits, flaunting their subjects' wealth, glamour and social superiority. The line runs though George IV's court painter, Thomas Lawrence, to those two notorious recorders of the Edwardian establishment at its most plutocratic, the American John Singer Sargent and the Hungarian Philip de Laszló. The latter's Mrs George Sandys (1915) is blatantly indebted to Van Dyck's Countess of Carlisle (1637). Sargent's Earl of Dalhousie, painted in 1900, the year of the great Van Dyck exhibition at the Royal Academy, wears a tropical suit and necktie, but his intolerable hauteur instantly recalls that of Lord John and Lord Bernard Stuart, those two disdainful youths depicted by Van Dyck around 1638.\n\nThe Tate exhibition will not contain many surprises for the expert, but it should afford most of us enormous visual pleasure; and it is likely to confirm the feeling, so hard to eradicate, that even if the Cavaliers were wrong, they were undoubtedly romantic."
