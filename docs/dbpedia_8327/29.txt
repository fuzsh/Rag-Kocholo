James I was born at Edinburgh Castle on 19 June 1556, son of Mary Queen of Scots and Henry, Lord Darnley. He acceded to the throne of Scotland in 1567, and that of England in 1603. He was married by proxy in Kronborg on 20 August 1589 to Anne of Denmark (1574-1619), second daughter of Frederick II, King of Denmark and Norway. His early face pattern was supplanted in 1618 by this one by Paul van Somer. The key, full-length version, dated 1618, is in the Royal Collection.
