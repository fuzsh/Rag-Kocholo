INDAGARE AUTENTICITÃ E ATTRIBUZIONI DELL'ART - ENQUÃTE SUR L'AUTHENTICITÃ ET LES ATTRIBUTIONS DE L'ART

Sir Anthony van Dyck

Anthonis van Dyck - Antoon Van Dyck - Flemish

(Born Antwerp, 22 March 1599; died London, 9 December 1641)

There is certainly no need at all to repeat any biography of this artist's life here. His stature in the worlds history of art as one of its greatest portreait painters ever, is cast in stone.

But as can be seen from the examples set out below, his paintings can fetch enormously high prices at auction, some well exceeding their auction estimates. So there is always a need to be cautious and scrutinise with a view to confirming both the legitimacy of any painting claiming to be by the artist and equally, understanding fully, any descriptors that are given if offered for sale.

Identifying any historically incorrect attributions that may have been previously given is vitally important as they may need to be fully investigated and clarified.

Unfortunately there are some artist attributions and descriptions that are deliberately falsified to deceive potential buyers. So any formal attribution should also be examined very carefully indeed. If only to verify that the quality, level of academicism and the accuracy of that assignment to that particular artist is well established and rightfully ascribed.

Confirming that it is specifically accurate, correctly researched and a credible academic attribution is essential and it should always be kept in mind, that any attribution, no matter at what level of credibility or status it comes from, is still only an opinion that the work 'might' be by that artist.

It's a matter of your personal interpretation, discretion and judgement as to how you view and indeed, respect it.

To help understand the generally observed and well accepted semantics that are used in auction descriptions, they are set out further down this page. They define exactly what the 'expert' view of the work being offered is and they can also have a distinct bearing on the financial outcome. So be cautious that you don't miss the often well 'disguised' attribution. One that is carefully placed or even hidden somewhere in that descriptor which starts off by stating that it actually is BY the artist.

* ABOUT A WORK OF ARTS DESCRIPTOR AND ITS TERMINOLOGY *

As if in this case as if they were defining the works of the artist;Â Â

Anthony van Dyck

Â

Â

Â *It is very important to clearly understand the general auction terms that are widely used in a published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be created in the 'manner of' the artist, or those which could be variants of the artists works of art that 'bear an applied signature' or monogram.

Â Where the name, Anthony van Dyck is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, usually cited as, Antony van Dyck, called Anthony van Dyck - including the dates to be specific, then in their qualified and professional opinion, they are in no doubt, it is a genuine and authentic item. One painted by that specific artist. This is usually fully qualified by its inclusion in any catalogue raissone, or by the guarantee of the opinion given by appropriate and internationally recognized expert authority on that artist.

Â When Antony van Dyck, is the term used, or it is similarly defined as Attrib. to ' [abbreviated,] or Attribue, imputer Ã , imputÃ©e, or atribudo, or ascribed to, then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But... there is no guarantee. It is only an opinion that it only 'possibly' may be by the artist.

Â But if the term Antony van Dyck, or Anthony van Dyck- circle of, entourage, or "Circle of "Anthony van Dyck is specifically used, then in their opinion, it is a work only of the period of the artist, but showing their influence. Or by someone closely associated with the artist, BUT not necessarily by their pupil, assistant or student.

Â When the name is given thus; Painted in the "Style of or "Follower of Antony van Dyck is used, this means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artist's way, in their 'style', but not necessarily by a pupil. Yet it may be a contemporary, or nearly a contemporary of the artist.

Â If the phrase in the "Manner of Anthony van Dyck is used or is defined.." then in their opinion it is also only a work painted in the style of the artist, but of a later date and definitely not by the artist as named.

Â When the term "After Anthony van Dyck" is the term used, then in their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist. This also applies to prints made 'after' an original work of art either by the artist or another artist/ printmaker.

Â Signed - Anthony van Dyck; "Dated.." or "Inscribed Anthony van Dyck" then in their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark ? however, indicates a strong element of doubt.

Â When the term 'Bears signature', is used, or the name, Anthony van Dyckis specified followed by the words; "With signature ..", or "With date .." or "With ......inscription.." or "Bears signature of Anthony van Dyck/ date / or inscription" Then in 'their opinion,' either the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, apocryphal, of doubtful authenticity, forged and has been added by someone else other than the artist.
