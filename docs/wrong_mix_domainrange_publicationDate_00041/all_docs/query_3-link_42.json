In the podcast this week I take a look at ChatGPT and it’s feelings about the housing crisis – have a listen and see how I got on!\n\nI’m starting a new series on the blog this week, answering the question I was asked many times at the end of last year – should people sell their property portfolio (or withdraw their offers) in the face of an economic downturn? As ever, there are no easy answers!\n\nPODCAST #141: Could ChatGPT and AI Solve the Housing Crisis?\n\nIt seems everywhere I look I am seeing articles and videos about ChatGPT and just how groundbreaking this artificial intelligence tool is, I thought I would ask it how to fix the housing crisis - I hope you enjoy!\n\nON THE BLOG - Should I stay or should I go? (Part 1)\n\nI noticed towards the end of last year that the same question was being asked over and over on my livestream Q&A sessions: with all the talk in the media of recession and slowdown in the economy etc, should people sell their properties (or withdraw any offers they might have recently made)?\n\nThese are very understandable questions and concerns. How should you choose the correct path? There’s no simple answer, but there are a lot of questions that you need to start asking yourself when it comes to making any kind of a dramatic shift in the strategy you've been following till now.\n\nBTF Rewind\n\nIn this video we turn back the clock to October 2021 and a discussion I had on mastering the sales process with my good friend Marc O'Dwyer. Marc is from Dublin, Ireland and is the owner/founder of Irish tax & accounting software business Big Red Cloud.\n\nIt’s the first of our new 'BTF Rewind Series' where we feature unpublished video footage from previously aired audio-only podcasts. An audio version of this podcast can be found on Behind The Facade Podcast Episode 76. Mastering the Sales Process with Marc O'Dwyer\n\nThat's all for this week folks – see you next time!"
