        "text": "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\nBy Philip K. Dick,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nMost will recognize this book from the title of the film adaptation: BladeRunner. Still, there’s something to be said for the originality of Dick’s title; specifically, it telegraphs to the reader that they should expect questions to ponder and their thoughts provoked.\n\nIn my view, writers are teachers, and I love that Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is never pedantic, but, rather, it’s didactic instead. It poses questions that will make the readers question the notion of a robot or android as sentient or not, without insisting that the book knows the definitive answer. Dick is wise enough to know that he doesn’t know the answers to the extraordinarily profound questions his wonderful novel poses regarding humanity and our future A.I. creations; a humility I’ll always admire.\n\nBy Philip K. Dick,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n15 authors picked Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAs the eagerly-anticipated new film Blade Runner 2049 finally comes to the screen, rediscover the world of Blade Runner . . .\n\nWorld War Terminus had left the Earth devastated. Through its ruins, bounty hunter Rick Deckard stalked, in search of the renegade replicants who were his prey. When he wasn't 'retiring' them with his laser weapon, he dreamed of owning a live animal - the ultimate status symbol in a world all but bereft of animal life.\n\nThen Rick got his chance: the assignment to kill six Nexus-6 targets, for a huge reward. But in Deckard's world things were…\n\nPreview\n\nFahrenheit 451\n\nBy Ray Bradbury,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nMost people think about Fahrenheit 451 as being a book that is almost exclusively about the struggle of one man against an oppressive, overreaching government. I disagree.\n\nAt its heart, it's about the weaknesses in our education systems that make Bradbury’s dystopian vision a sadly plausible future reality. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn, and Bradbury has noted how uncomfortable power has historically been with the books that educate the people—the books that don’t just explain “how” something should be done like an instruction manual, but dare to pose the question: “why?” Books that don’t simply ask “Could we?” but also, “Should we?”\n\nAs we grapple with keeping A.I. safe, the engineers at Google would be well advised to give Fahrenheit 451 another read.\n\nBy Ray Bradbury,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked Fahrenheit 451 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe hauntingly prophetic classic novel set in a not-too-distant future where books are burned by a special task force of firemen.\n\nOver 1 million copies sold in the UK.\n\nGuy Montag is a fireman. His job is to burn books, which are forbidden, being the source of all discord and unhappiness. Even so, Montag is unhappy; there is discord in his marriage. Are books hidden in his house? The Mechanical Hound of the Fire Department, armed with a lethal hypodermic, escorted by helicopters, is ready to track down those dissidents who defy society to preserve and read books.\n\nThe classic…\n\nPreview\n\nI, Robot\n\nBy Isaac Asimov,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nThere’s no other author who I’ve been compared to more than Asimov, and my readers have been astonished when I’ve confessed to them that I’ve never read any Asimov…that is until I was putting this list together and delved intoI, Robot, Asimov’s collection of short stories in which his famous “Three Laws of Robotics,” first appears.\n\nAnd after reading it, to all my readers, I get it.\n\nI wish I’d read him earlier!\n\nThe concepts are gigantic, both technologically, but also philosophically. I love the way he uses paradoxes to demonstrate that answers are not as simple as they may appear at first glance. And what other writer would dare have his omniscient narrator say: “it was as simple as a syllogism” absent irony?\n\nAsimov is the G.O.A.T.\n\nBy Isaac Asimov,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked I, Robot as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nVoyager Classics - timeless masterworks of science fiction and fantasy.\n\nA beautiful clothbound edition of I, Robot, the classic collection of robot stories from the master of the genre.\n\nIn these stories Isaac Asimov creates the Three Laws of Robotics and ushers in the Robot Age.\n\nEarth is ruled by master-machines but the Three Laws of Robotics have been designed to ensure humans maintain the upper hand:\n\n1) A robot may not injure a human being or allow a human being to come to harm\n\n2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology\n\nBy Ray Kurzweil,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nIf Ray hadn’t written The Singularity is Near, I would never have written my own books.\n\nIt was after reading a news article on the release of the book all the way back in early 2005, that, at the tender age of 27 and for the first time in my life, I knew I had a subject that people would love to read about—and I also had a plot!\n\nReading Ray’s description of being able to download “upgrades” to our bodies like we upgrade our computers, of immortality, and of molecular assemblers that could replicate anything we could want, sent my mind into a fevered trip through the Post-Human future.\n\nI read The Singularity is Near multiple times afterwards…it’s brilliant.\n\nBy Ray Kurzweil,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked The Singularity Is Near as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Startling in scope and bravado.\" -Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n\n\"Artfully envisions a breathtakingly better world.\" -Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Elaborate, smart and persuasive.\" -The Boston Globe\n\n\"A pleasure to read.\" -The Wall Street Journal\n\nOne of CBS News's Best Fall Books of 2005 * Among St Louis Post-Dispatch's Best Nonfiction Books of 2005 * One of Amazon.com's Best Science Books of 2005\n\nA radical and optimistic view of the future course of human development from the bestselling author of How to Create a Mind and The Singularity is Nearer who Bill Gates calls \"the best person I know at…\n\nPreview\n\nSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\n\nBy Nick Bostrom,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nI saved the most sobering and existentially terrifying book for last. This is the book that made Elon Musk famously tweet that strong A.I. is more dangerous than “nukes.”\n\nOn the flip side, strong A.I. (superhuman level intelligence) is an extraordinary concept that, once one accepts its almost certain inevitability, is worldview altering.\n\nIt’s also existentially horrific when one stops to examine the odds of successfully creating and remaining in control of an intelligence greater than ours.\n\nBostrom takes us through the problem and, for every solution he postulates, he demonstrates the several ways this hypothetical A.I. would circumvent them.\n\nIt’s the most existentially horrific book you’ll ever read, and it’s non-fiction philosophy. Who would’ve thought?\n\nEnjoy the existential chills!\n\nBy Nick Bostrom,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Superintelligence as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains.\n\nIf machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.\n\nBut we have one advantage:…\n\nPreview\n\nYou might also like..."
