        "text": "What makes someone worthy of empathy? The novel “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” by Philip K. Dick blurs the lines between the life of a human and the life of a destructive, dangerous, and deceptive machine. This concept challenges the question of whether androids are worthy of empathy or not. Through the lens of societal stereotypes and discrimination, and evidence of them having desires for a life and a capacity for empathy, it becomes evident that the androids deserve empathy. Generalising the characteristics and behaviours of a group and punishing the group as a whole based on the actions of selected individuals. These are the actions of stereotyping and discrimination. Androids are stereotyped as dangers to humanity, and because …show more content…\n\nAlthough these allegations are harsh, they have some truth behind them. However, it poses the question of whether all androids should be condemned due to the actions of a few. Every human is different; it is rare to find two humans who share the same mannerisms, opinions, and motivations. This uniqueness in humans unlocks the possibility that not all androids share the same dangerous and murderous desires. In fact, Luba Luft was seen as anything but dangerous to Rick Deckard. Rick saw Luba as “a superb singer (and it made him question) [...] how can a talent like that be a liability to [...] society?” (62). However, due to discrimination and stereotyping, Luba Luft was killed anyway. Situations like this raise ethical concerns we face in our own society. For instance, after 9/11, people with brown skin were categorised as terrorists. This led to many innocent people being killed due to the stereotypes that were implemented based on the actions of a group of individuals. We allow for a small group to represent an entire race. The families of the innocent and the victims themselves caused no harm, evoking sympathy and empathy for them. When …show more content…\n\nIn the book D.A.D.O.E.S., it is described that androids feel no empathy; however, this is false. Androids do have empathy, not for humans, but for other androids. Although it is described that “an android [...] doesn't care what happens to any other android” (45), if it meant they could save themselves, this act of betrayal would highlight the lack of empathy androids have for each other, but it instead shows an android's will to live more than anything. Granted, throwing another android under the bus is the opposite of empathy, but humans in our own society do the same. For instance, like androids, teenagers desire the chance to fit in by any means necessary. From changing their clothes and personalities to the bullying of their own friends, it is a natural human instinct to want to belong. These actions don't come from a place of evil, but instead from a place of insecurity and longing to be like everyone else. Despite teenagers' harmful attempts to fit in, they aren't judged for taking such drastic measures; instead, we feel for them. Nevertheless, it is unfair to categorise androids as having no empathy for each other based on the actions they take so they can fit in with humans. Additionally, when it comes down to hurting their own friends, teenagers often draw the line, just as androids do the same. For instance, after sleeping with Rick, Rachel describes, “each time"
