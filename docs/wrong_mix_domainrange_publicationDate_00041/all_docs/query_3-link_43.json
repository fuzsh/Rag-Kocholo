        "text": "Brought over from Movie thread:\n\nBladerunner & BR 2049 Spoilers\n\nJust finished it, still like it.\n\nSo:\n\nIs Deckard a replicant? No, as I recall an interview with the Director.\n\nDid Rachel live more than 4 years? She was an experimental model, although Tyrell just before he dies tells Roy Batty: we made you as best we could. If she had become pregnant near the end of this movie in Los Angeles 2019, by 2049, the daughter would have been just under 30.\n\nA powerful monologue: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_in_rain_monologue\n\nI just read through the Wikipedia page and discovered the book \"Tears in Rain (Bruna Husky)\" and ordered it. It looks like it will be a good read.\n\nPlease report back. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15096204-tears-in-rain\n\nSide note: Rutger Hauer passed away last summer.\n\nOf possible interest this is one of the critical reviews of the movie:\n\nToo bad the filmmakers didn't try to recapture the modest virtues of the Dick novel, which (despite many flaws of its own) has a humor and humanity that are nowhere felt in 'Blade Runner.\n\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner\n\nI do agree that the movie is divergent from the book (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep). They are almost like 2 different stories in tone. Here is an analysis:\n\nMoved from Movie thread:\n\nOr maybe not\n\nDeckard was very much a replicant as was illustrated in the original BR when Gaff leaves the origami unicorn and BR 4049 when Wallace explains the set up between Deckard and Rachel. On the flip side I believe that Harrison Ford has always stated the opposite\n\nLike many I think the question is the more interesting facet and the ambiguity of it all, however I believe the signs are there although subtle.\n\nQ-6\n\nOk, we are not arguing. I acknowledge your sources. I think they have toyed with us over the years. However, Tyrell told Decard she was special, but Rachel could have died from childbirth within the 4 year time frame and 2049 still would have worked for her daughter, so that is unresolved. This would not explain how Deckard lived 30 years. I’m not sure how long the new post Tyrell replicants Live.\n\nI think the unicorn dream and the unicorn left by his partner, might be a slam dunk argument that Deckard was a replicant, I think was also a tease with movie makers messing with the audiences.\n\nThis quote is also interesting because it is contradictory and in the Final Cut, where the director had control, he did not kill her, they flew the coup together:\n\nThough it is never explicitly said in the movie, Ridley Scott has confirmed that Deckard was a replicant. He said in the Channel 4 documentary, On the Edge of Blade Runner, that \"Deckard is a Nexus 7, he probably has an unknown life span and therefore is starting to get awfully human.\" Screenwriter, Hampton Fancher, said in 1999 that he never wrote the blade runner as a replicant but in later drafts he toyed with the idea.\n\nHe was less human than the people he was after, because they were machines. He was more of a machine. And he becomes less of a machine through the ordeal of falling in love with [Rachael]. She's smarter than he is and she's better than he is, and at the end, he kills her. And it's not an outright execution. It's elliptical. But you hear the shot, and you see where it took place, and you saw her face, and she wanted it, and it was an act of love.\"\n\nMoved from Movie thread:\n\nOk, we are not arguing.

They are almost like 2 different stories in tone. Here is an analysis:\n\nPSA: Don't watch that if you are thinking about reading the book. Even if you've seen the film, it contains massive spoilers for the book.\n\nI think a less spoiler-y summary is that the book is less about \"is Deckard really a replicant?\" and more about \"is there really a difference?\" and digs in to the artificiality of human life (esp. in the satirically exaggerated future described in the book).\n\nThere's lots of extra detail and inter-connection in the book that, for example, explains what the VK test is all about (and casts doubt on its objectivity). Plus, yes, actual electric sheep. OTOH, the iconic final \"tears in rain\" soliloquy was entirely a movie creation (and, apparently, mostly Rutger Hauer's invention) - and, as for the visuals and atmosphere of the film... well, what can you say?\n\nBy Blade Runner 2049 any remaining connection with the book has pretty much been lost.\n\nI think its a huge irony that Philip K Dick has become possibly the most successful example of a SF writer's work being adapted to the screen because his work is so un-filmable that the filmmakers just cherry-pick a few choice themes and create an original screenplay around them. Now, \"Inspired by a novel by Philip K Dick\" is probably a big help to getting a movie/show green-lighted...\n\nI actually think the original Total Recall and even Minority Report were better yarns than the source material - We Can Remember for you Wholesale is mainly a comedy and both are short stories that wouldn't stretch beyond 45 minutes.\n\nI'll be interested to see how Asimov's Foundation survives the process - its an undisputed classic book, but its also 230 pages of rather stilted talking heads expositing while most of the action happens off-page - a literal transcription for the screen would be about as exciting as the opening text crawl of Phantom Menace (...suspiciously similar, in fact - Coruscant = Trantor, anyone?) Plus, the basic premise has been pretty much debunked by chaos theory etc.\n\n[doublepost=1568720306][/doublepost]\n\nHuh. I never heard of Decard possibly being a replicant. I always interpreted the unicorn origami at the end, as Rachel steps on it, to mean that she was the unicorn.\n\nTrouble is, the original release of the film cut the earlier scene where Deckard dreams about the unicorn (...plus, if I recall correctly, pasted on the voice-over about her not having an expiry date) - so you can be forgiven for not getting it.\n\nHuh.

He was clearly no match physically against the Nexus 6s. So if replicant, what was he? Rachel was an experimental model (Nexus7? Maybe not, described as “special” by Tyrell) ) and we have no idea what she was capable of physically, plus we don’t know what her actual life span was because she died in childbirth 2021.\n\nScott may have been hot and cold on the idea of Deckard being a replicant, but I don’t trust his word after the fact based on what I witnessed in the movies The original Blade Runner Movie writer stated in an interview that he operated under the premise that Deckard was human. I can only assume this was with the concurrence of the Director.\n\nScott definitely planted a teaser, the unicorn dream in several versions of the original film to raise the possibility, but it is never definitively established so from what we can observe in the films, I’ll say human, that the speculation was allowed to drift in BR 2049, but I’m still open to the possibility Deckard was not human.\n\nI think for this franchise, the story has moved on beyond Rachel and Deckard so it might not ever be firmly established, unless the next director goes out of his way to nail this down.\n\nPosted only for interesting reading: https://screenrant.com/blade-runner-2049-rachael-deckard-daughter-backstory-explained/\n\nI am possibly interesting in reading the book, but in any case am a big fan of both films and am especially glad I was not let down by the sequel as so many others.\n\nI liked the sequel quite a bit, might even say loved it.\n\nFWIW, I've spent the last few decades talking, writing (including some lengthy thesis papers), discussing the book, the movie (all flavors), more recently the sequel. Owned the original movie on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, BD, BD special edition The original PKD book was one of the first \"serious scifi\" works I read, when I was around 12 or so. I routinely list Blade Runner in my Top 5 films of all time.\n\nI grew to love the sequel, it moved me. My initial impression was is this all there is? Clearly, I had an expectation problem, but I adjusted. It’s based on relationships, and a futuristic, artistic film noir, more than being an action film. I was really impressed with David Battista’s performance and was sad it was so brief. Jared Leto was sinister and megleomanically as Niander Wallace. The scene with the new born replicant was brutal. Ryan Gosling’s performance was impressively nuanced, the unspoken hope he had\n\nhe was born into this world\n\nthat was squashed, and I hoped we were not watching him die on the steps of the Upgrade Center.\n\nMore stuff, I did not realize:\n\nWill we see another Blade Runner? Maybe not. That makes me sad.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 Hologram Fight Was Almost Cut\n\nhttps://screenrant.com/blade-runner-204-hologram-fight-deleted-scenes/\n\nSadly, despite the strong reviews and levels of hype prior to release, the film wasn’t a success, so another sequel looks unlikely. Some blame the film’s performance on the marketing campaign, which was extremely vague on what the actual story of the movie was. Others also point to Blade Runner being more of a cult film than a tentpole, so a big-budget sequel was always going to struggle.\n\n'Blade Runner 2049' Is A Box Office Bomb: 10 Reasons It Was Doomed\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/scottm...as-doomed-at-the-u-s-box-office/#1176104e24fb\n\nSadly I tend to agree, equally I most certainly don't want a watered down PG 13 mess. By far I prefer Blade Runner to go out on a high note and not be \"milked\" for all it's worth. Personally I never expected Blade Runner 2049 to be a blockbuster at the box office, what I will say is that Blade Runner 2049 met and exceeded my expectations.\n\nSo many brands are in the \"bucket\" now thanks to serving the vocal minority; Alien, Terminator, Starwars and the list goes on and on. Only thing that seems doomed is decent films aimed at the majority of adults, anyway my solution is simple I don't waste my time and money on the garbage\n\nQ-6\n\nSadly I tend to agree, equally I most certainly don't want a watered down PG 13 mess.

As I said for myself, it was not what I expected, but I digested it and recognized it’s story goodness and sadness, as I remember K screams when he realizes he is not the one. It is movie artistry of the highest degree, visually and narratively.\n\nNow as far as those other big name franchises you mentioned (my evaluation), out of the 6 Alien movies, only 3 were worthy. For Terminator, I liked 4 of them including Christian Bale’s entry. Star Wars, beyond the original trilogy has been a huge frick’n blockbuster travesty except for Rogue One.\n\nSo I think we agree that box office does not equate to quality, with the sad effect of studios making movies that appeal to the lowest common denominator to increase sales. A good example of this are many of the Marvel Franchise movies that include obligatory action, but I still count many of them as excellent stories, but my point is, if they don’t have the requisite action, they may flop at the box office because this seems to be what is required to hold the attention of the masses.
