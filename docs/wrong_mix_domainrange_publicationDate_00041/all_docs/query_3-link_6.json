        "text": "Usually when an audience member decides to enjoy the fruits of an adaptation, the typical response is to compare the two side by side in a checklist fashion, rating which did best in terms of story portrayal, character development, and so on. Along with the standard issues that come with directly comparing one work with another when they reside in vastly different mediums also comes the idea of one needing to be “better” or “worse” than the other. When both an adaptation and original are incredibly good, but in vastly different ways, ranking them means nothing during discussion, and it’s a fallacious idea that judging them in that way is necessary. Yet we are compelled to do it, and one such example that renders this compulsion meaningless is Blade Runner in comparison to its source material, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\n1982’s Blade Runner is a cult film that saw success after its first doomed initial release two months after Speilberg’s E.T. the Extra Terrestrial and other competing sci-fi hits that dominated the early 80’s, such as Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan and John Carpenter’s The Thing remake; Blade Runner was in a sea of great films in the same genre and, unfortunately, it didn’t seem to stick out at its initial release. After a few subsequent cuts were released, it was finally cemented as the extraordinary, ground-breaking film we think of when we hear the title. The film stars Harrison Ford, freshly thrown into the height of his stardom after Star Wars and Indiana Jones, with Rutger Haur and his stand out performance as Roy Batty and Sean Young as Rachel along with many others. The film was directed by Ridley Scott, with the screenplay finalized by David Peoples from the initial screenplay by Hampton Fancher, who originally had a large amount of voice-overs and a strong environmental message in his script. Although the actors were certainly worthy of praise, the most impressive aspect of the film is easily the mixture of Syd Mead’s fantastic artistic vision of the Blade Runner environment and aesthetic along with the brilliant cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth.\n\nThe star of the film is the amazing aesthetics, shown by these images that were taken from the newest HD rendition of the film. The miniature city looks incredibly convincing and real with the first image of the Tyrell Corporation and its subsequent shots from that scene being particularly impressive. Nearly every panning, far, or transition shot of the environment is breath-taking, especially in the recent stunning remastering, and brings a believability and richness to the environment that is reflected in everything from the advertisements, to the dress of the people, to the design of the hover cars that those people travel in. While not necessarily accurate to the dusty, dry environment of the book, there is plenty of ambiguity of the cityscape, especially when it featured Philip K. Dick’s seal of approval as being, “exactly as he imagined it.”[1] Another major contributor to the environment and immersive nature of the film is the amazing soundtrack by Vangelis, which has also been released multiple times in many formats. The mixture of synth with slow pacing and echoing effects reinforces the Noir feeling of the film, heavily invoking the futuristic setting and, in a way, making it a strange mixture of timeless sound yet very cemented in the 80’s music scene.[2]\n\nBlade Runner features a similar story that is featured in Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? with Rick Deckard being sent on a mission to retire four androids, or replicants, that a previous detective was tracking down before being hospitalized. On his journey he meets Rachel, who suddenly assists him in his task when previously distrusting him, and they become close as he gains on the last and most powerful of the replicants. That is about where the similarities end, besides the back story of war, colonization, and the original use and creation of the androids that is mentioned briefly at the beginning of the film. Despite the movie being well loved, it has many different editions and cuts that have been made. These cuts range from changing aspects of the story from the mundane and small to more important aspects, like the ending and removing voice-overs. Though many would agree that the best and quintessential cut of Blade Runner be the Director’s Cut, which makes significant changes to the film to better reflect Ridley Scott’s vision that he was not able to create at the original time of filming, there are still plenty of fans that prefer the U.S. Theatrical version. Considering there are five cuts to choose from with this film, there’s a bit of conjecture about the story, but mostly about the ending, which I won’t be discussing in this review.[3]\n\nWhat the book lacks in what only a visual medium can bring us, it heavily makes up for in what film struggles to convey to an audience. In terms of story, the movie is loosely adapted and related to the novel in question. Aside from the few characters that both have in common, the general setting, and certain key events, they are completely different narratives and experiences. The movie heavily changes certain characters in order to make its themes more compelling, and drops an entire half of the book that would only have muddied the sharp focus it wanted. The plight and story of the Chicken Head, Isildor, is essentially translated into a somewhat similar character in the film, Sebastian, but is changed from a slow-thinking, stuttering little man to an awkward, rapidly aging bioengineer with the depth of his story is completely removed. The cultish religion of Mercerism, which is extremely prevalent and important throughout the novel, is stripped from the film, and the titular Electric Sheep (or real versus electric animals) and the importance that distinction has on Deckard is downgraded from a defining motivator to a mere mention of an owl. Regardless of how one might feel about these changes, one of the best changes made was that of the character Roy Baty (Roy Batty in the film) from a hulking, arrogant and bossy android to a similar android with an arc and the desperation to keep living. His character is much rounder and more interesting, seemingly at the consequence of Deckard’s own lacking characterization in the film, including his marriage status.\n\nIn general, the film and novel both explore ideas about humanity, fear, death, real vs. artificial, identity, and morality. The novel further explores gaining and losing hope, widens the artificiality to animals in order to explore responsibility and pride, relationships, and plenty of other minor themes. The film certainly looks at or hints at more minor themes, but it’s very focused narrative easily shows the previous ones mentioned as the post important to inquire on. This is to be expected, as a film that meanders too much, even if it’s for thematic reasons, will quickly lose its focus as well as the attention of its audience. Books have more freedom to direct the reader and don’t have the imposed time constraints that films do. At a nearly 2 hour run time, Blade Runner does a good job at covering four intricate themes in the depth that it does, and the two screen writers did a great job cutting out what they didn’t need from the breadth of the source material. What results is two different pieces of entertainment that have small things in common and look at similar themes, but explore then in different ways and come to different conclusions as well as setting up differing tones as the narrative evolves.\n\nAlthough comparisons help determine the flaws and constants of both pieces, it is sometimes a fruitless effort, especially in this case. Both Blade Runner and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? are masterpieces of science fiction in their own unique ways, and both should be consumed in respect to their own merits and shortcomings. Philip K. Dick is a renowned and well respected science fiction writer, and his imagination and ideas reflect well in both pieces despite their differences. Whether you like one over the other, it’s hard to argue that both are fantastic as not only science fiction pieces, but as works of Art.\n\nBanner from here.\n\nSources:\n\n(For Wiki pages, I always endeavor to check to make sure the information’s source is credited and reputable in the citations on the bottom of the page.)\n\n[1] – Blade Runner – Wikipedia\n\n[2] – Blade Runner Soundtrack Full Vinyl Rip – Youtube\n\n[3] – Versions of Blade Runner – Wikipedia"
