        "text": "Mayor Emanuel and Chicago Public Library (CPL) today announced Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick will be the 29th selection of CPL’s One Book, One Chicago (OBOC). From October 2018 through April 2019, Chicagoans will learn more about science fiction, technology, future societies, artificial intelligence and more as they explore the book and this year’s theme—Imagine the Future.\n\n“This year, residents across Chicago will dive into the world of science fiction and consider the role technology and artificial intelligence plays in our future generations,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “I look forward to joining in as we embark on this shared reading experience together.”\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which was first published in 1968, introduces readers to protagonist Rick Deckard in the year 2021 as he maneuvers his way through the new world order. This iconic book was the inspiration for the blockbuster film Blade Runner.\n\nPhilip K. Dick was born in Chicago in 1928 and lived most of his life in California. In 1952, he began writing professionally and proceeded to write numerous novels and short story collections. He won the Hugo Award for the best novel in 1962 for The Man in the High Castle and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel of the year in 1974 for Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.\n\n“At CPL, we strive to bring great cultural programming to our patrons and are always excited to do that through the One Book, One Chicago program,” said Commissioner Brian Bannon. “We hope that everyone is just as eager to explore such an expansive and interesting theme with us.”\n\nCPL will join community partners to offer Chicagoans a variety of events and programs, including walking tours, history programs, discussions, and more, to bring people, businesses and civic agencies together to engage with the book and theme. Free citywide programs will launch in early October.\n\nAdditional highlights of this year’s One Book, One Chicago program include:\n\nAuthor talks with notable science fiction authors;\n\nBook discussions throughout the city to discuss what the future of technology holds;\n\nActivities at CPL’s award-winning Maker Lab including building futuristic eyewear and out-of-this-world sound frequencies;\n\nLearning Circles to learn android programming basics;\n\nNeighborhood walking tours with author and historian Max Grinnell to talk about planned projects for Chicago;\n\nLive performance of The War of the Worlds, the iconic radio broadcast adapted from H.G. Wells’ novel; and\n\nLearning sessions about how to protect yourself and your family with emergency preparedness programs.\n\nFor a complete list of programs and to learn ways you can engage with other readers, visit onebookonechicago.org.\n\nOne Book, One Chicago is a citywide program that launched in fall 2001 as an opportunity to engage and enlighten Chicagoans and to foster a sense of community through reading. After more than a decade of celebrating a culture of reading, One Book, One Chicago expanded in 2013. CPL and its community partners now bring communities together by offering a full season of learning and engagement annually, focusing not just on one book but on a central theme integral to the lives of all Chicagoans.\n\nEach year, CPL offers a diverse series of programs that explore the theme from multiple perspectives, as recounted through personal experience, imagined in literature, presented in politics, or synthesized in music and art.\n\nOne Book, One Chicago is made possible by the Chicago Public Library Foundation, funded through generous support from The Chicago Community Trust and United Airlines.\n\nAbout Chicago Public Library\n\nSince 1873, Chicago Public Library (CPL) has encouraged lifelong learning by welcoming all people and offering equal access to information, entertainment and knowledge through innovative services and programs, as well as cutting-edge technology.
