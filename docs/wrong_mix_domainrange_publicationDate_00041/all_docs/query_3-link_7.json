        "text": "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, science-fiction novel by Philip K. Dick, published in 1968.\n\nDick’s novels are a continual and sometimes surprising source of inspiration for Hollywood. Total Recall (1990; from the 1966 short story “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale”), Minority Report (2002), Paycheck (2003), and A Scanner Darkly (2006) have all graced blockbuster screens. The complexities of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? inspired Ridley Scott’s groundbreaking Blade Runner (1982), but, as extraordinary as the movie is, it remains a pale shade of the text.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, Last Lines Quiz\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? questions the nature of humanity through the figure of Rick Deckard, a man who hunts “replicants”—androids designed to be “more human than human,” serving as de facto slaves to the lucky inhabitants of Earth who have managed to escape the nuclear war–ravaged planet for off-world colonies on Mars and elsewhere. Some of these “andys” prefer freedom on Earth to servitude, and for the crime of returning they are punished by being “retired,” or executed. The nominal “sheep” of the title is an artificial creation that dies through Deckard’s neglect, a source of intense shame to him.\n\nDeckard’s machine-like lack of empathy for his prey, fundamental to Dick’s distinction between human and replicant, suggests the much-debated question of whether Deckard himself may be one of the replicants he hunts. Deckard’s growing ethical confusion about killing the replicants is highlighted by the book’s extension into the quasi-religious undertones of persuasion and vicarious lived experience. The religion of Mercerism—from which replicants are prohibited—is a typical Dick invention. Mercer is a false idol, and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? not only asks what it means to be human, as Deckard realizes that “the electric things have their lives, too,” but it also, in an expression of Dick’s philosophy, questions the viability of reality itself."
