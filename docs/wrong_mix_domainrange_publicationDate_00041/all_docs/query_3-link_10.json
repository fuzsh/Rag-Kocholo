        "text": "Spoiler alert for the movies Blade Runner (1982) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017)\n\nBLADE RUNNER (1982) is a neo-noir science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\nThe film takes place in the utopian Los Angeles of the future, where the Tyrell Corporation creates synthetic human replicants and settles them on other planets. Replicants are artificially intelligent humanoids and more specifically, according to Blade Runner 2049 opening crawl: “Replicants are bioengineered humans, designed by Tyrell Corporation for use off-world. Their enhanced strength made them ideal slave labor. After a series of violent rebellions, their manufacture became prohibited and Tyrell Corp went bankrupt. The collapse of ecosystems in the mid-2020s led to the rise of industrialist Niander Wallace, whose mastery of synthetic farming averted famine. Wallace acquired the remains of Tyrell Corp and created a new line of replicants who obey. Many older model replicants — NEXUS 8s with open-ended lifespans — survived. They are hunted down and “Retired”. Those that hunt them still go by the name… Blade Runner.”\n\nThere are other names for replicants such as “skin jobs” or “skinners,” which are considered offensive because it indicates that the replicants differ from humans, especially in their ability to empathize. It should be noted here that this kind of understanding of the term is caused by the voiceovers of the theatrical version because at first, it is only referred to as replicant slang.\n\nThere are two levels of people in the film. The upper level is rich and healthy — they are given the opportunity to “start life all over again in a world of golden opportunity and adventure”. The other level of people consists of those in need and poverty who can not go to another planet. They are trapped in an earth that is dark, hopeless, and depressing.\n\nBelow these levels are the replicants, who are treated as slaves in the World Colony and used to explore and colonize other planets. After a group of six escape from their colony on Earth, the replicants are outlawed and blade runners are ordered to kill them on sight.\n\nAs I mentioned, the story takes place in the Los Angeles of the future in 2019, which is more like a futuristic Tokyo. Cars fly in the air along with airplanes, which is obviously presented as the most comfortable form of transportation. Neon lights line the streets with huge banners and advertisements. In such a dark urban jungle, feelings of poverty, hopelessness, and fear can overwhelm a person.\n\nThere are 7 different versions of the film due to Warner Brothers. The Ridley Scott-approved Director’s Cut was released in 1992, and despite its audio and video quality, it became one of the first films to be released on DVD. After that, the final change took place in 2007 — The Final Cut.\n\nDespite many criticisms, over time the film became a cult classic and took a leading place in science fiction. It has influenced many films and video games and becom an inspiration to the development of the anime genre. Its soundtrack was nominated for BAFTA and a Golden Globe — Best Film Music Awards. Of course, those awards are not all. The film won many other awards, among which are the BAFTA nominations: Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. It was nominated for Best Achievement in Art Direction and Best Achievement in Sound Effects Editing at the Academy Awards.\n\nMany critics consider the main points made in the film to be a disadvantage of the project, which is heavily focused on the visualization of the future world and where there is a small amount of screen time for relationships between the characters. In my personal opinion, the background of the time is an astonishing visual that does not “oppress” the story, but on the contrary, it develops it. It is noteworthy that Douglas Trumbull, who owns the masterpiece “A Space Odyssey” released in 2001, worked on these effects.\n\nAlso, the film critics of that time wrote that this work reflected the director’s journey through nightmares. But in 2022, the concept of the future has changed to a great extent; what was thought to happen in the 80s and 90s has actually happened, and flying cars and self-tying Adidas boots weren’t a part of it. The main thing is that the future, which was to become one big global space for a part of society, has already arrived and we will gradually feel it more significantly. The Internet and mass media are the beginning of this. Accordingly, criticism in which the film is simply a journey into the author’s nightmares cannot be relevant.\n\nAs I previously indicated, the film belongs to the noir genre and it can be loudly said that it traditionally follows this genre. For example, themes of religion can be found repeatedly in the film. It must be pointed out that the situation is similar to the process of mastering genetic engineering by humans, and is described in a classical Greek medieval context.\n\nFrom the Bible, there is a clear parallel with Noah and the flood. From literature with Frankenstein and linguistically Immortality-Mortality can be said to be largely inspired by the “Immortal game” of chess played by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky on 21 June 1851 in London. Despite this, the director cited that this parallel (“Immortal game”) was completely accidental.\n\nThe director emphasizes the conflict between the past and the future many times. Where we saw a highly modified future, here we see destroyed people and an environment to match. This kind of subject matter in the film makes it interesting to study humanity. When the replicant turns out to be more empathetic than the human when establishing the replicant’s humanity, one thing become clear: the crowd is more cold and faceless.\n\nOne of the main points of the film is whether Deckard is a human or a replicant, which once again makes the audience wonder what it means to be human. Michael Dill and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human, while Fancher wanted to leave the ambiguity. Scott Ridley finally said that he thought Deckard was human. In this regard, Deckard’s dream where he sees a white-horned unicorn is of great importance. As a consequence of this, some viewers believe that Deckard is a replicant (since Roy sees a similar dream). I think the horse is an example of replicants and humans having the same dreams and that the difference between humans and replicants is not too big.\n\nThe main theme in the film and, moreover, the main idea that runs through the entire movie is: “What does it mean to be human?” What is the difference between a human and an artificially intelligent replicant in the same body? Replicant Roy Bett also suffers from such thoughts.\n\nAs I mentioned, the film is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The book is considered one of the most outstanding novels by the author Philip Dick. However, his fame is largely due to the big-screen adaptation of the book, Blade Runner.\n\nBlade Runner is, in my opinion, not only the best sci-fi film ever made but also a visually flawless piece of work. Which, despite being 37 years old, stands proudly on the page of today’s CGI fests. This kind of attitude towards the film made me interested in its source material. After I read the book, I was a little disappointed. Not because I didn’t like the book, but because of the differences between the novel and the movie. In fact, the only thing that “survived” from the book during the adaptation was the names of the characters. Even the name android was changed to “replicant” at the insistence of the director (Ridley Scott).\n\n“Blade Runner 2049” has also been released (in 2017), which was quite an ambitious project, primarily because this film is a sequel to Ridley Scott’s classic Blade Runner. Fortunately, the director who took up this project was Danny Villeneuve, a Canadian director who has created a number of outstanding modern films such as Sicario, Arrival, Dune, and more.\n\nA little about Blade Runner 2049: 30 have passed since the events that took place in the first film. Policeman K suddenly discovers a long-forgotten secret that threatens to destroy civilization. He decides to find Rick Deckard, who has been hunting replicants for a long time. Ricky has been missing for 30 years. The main pride of this film is the infinite talent of the cameraman and graphic artists, here’s a shot that exemplifies more than words can express.\n\nBy the time it became known that Ridley Scott was going to make a sequel to Blade Runner, movie lovers met this news with a little fear. I was one of those skeptics and argued that the classics do not need to be continued. However, after understanding the details and after the release and viewing of the film, I was convinced that this film entered my list of what I consider to be the best films.\n\nAs for us big fans of movies and even more fans of Blade Runner, we are left to ponder: “Do androids dream of electric sheep?”"
