        "text": "Ridley Scott wanted to tell a story that was tightly focused on the two key players, Deckard and Rachael, and - if you accept his more recent comments - to make it a love story.\n\nHis 21st century director's cut certainly plays up the love angle, which is far more iconic and of far broader appeal to an audience than a routine sci-fi shoot-em-up (which was basically what the original cinema release amounted to).\n\nAlthough the three points you identify as being omitted from the screenplay are interesting concepts, in terms of Philip K Dick's dark vision of the world in the 21st Century, in terms of the movie all three points amount only to padding.\n\nThey do not bear directly on Deckard's hunt for the missing replicants, but are merely incidental aspects that seek to explain or expand on the world-setting within which the hunt takes place.\n\nThey do not have any direct connection with the love story, as Deckard begins to fall in love with Rachael. She is probably - depending on which cut of the movie you watch - unaware that she is not human, which engages Deckard's initial sympathy for her.\n\nTherefore the three points in question are not necessary in order to tell the story of Deckard's investigation. A movie must concentrate only on essentials, because otherwise it quickly loses focus.\n\nThis movie in particular, which has more re-edited releases than almost any other in film history, desperately needs to retain its focus and concentrate its limited screen time on the key element of the storyline: which is a 21st century re-make of the movie \"Love Story\".\n\nI cannot speak definitely but it might be that Ridley Scott wanted to tell a slightly different story or thought he could tell it in a better way?\n\nAlso, bear in mind that books and films are very different media. What makes an exciting book might not work if translated directly to film due to pacing, audience expectations etc.\n\nThe hunt for Red October is a good example. The climax in the book was very good but would have translated poorly to film and they opt for more of a shoot out rather than a psychological battles of wits against the sabatuer."
