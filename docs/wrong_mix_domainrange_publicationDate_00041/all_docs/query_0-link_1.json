        "text": "This list of fictional robots and androids is chronological, and categorised by medium. It includes all depictions of robots, androids and gynoids in literature, television, and cinema; however, robots that have appeared in more than one form of media are not necessarily listed in each of those media. This list is intended for all fictional computers which are described as existing in a humanlike or mobile form. It shows how the concept has developed in the human imagination through history.\n\nRobots and androids have frequently been depicted or described in works of fiction. The word \"robot\" itself comes from a work of fiction, Karel Čapek's play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), written in 1920 and first performed in 1921.\n\nFor robots produced for entertainment in the eighteenth century, see Automaton § Modern automata.\n\nCoppélia, a life-size dancing doll in the ballet of the same name, choreographed by Marius Petipa with music by Léo Delibes (1870)\n\nThe word robot comes from Karel Čapek's play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), written in 1920 in Czech and first performed in 1921. Performed in New York 1922 and an English edition published in 1923. In the play, the word refers to artificially created life forms.[1] Named robots in the play are Marius, Sulla, Radius, Primus, Helena, and Damon. The play introduced and popularized the term \"robot\". Čapek's robots are biological machines that are assembled, as opposed to grown or born.\n\nSee also: Robots in literature\n\nThe woman forged out of gold in Finnish myth The Kalevala (prehistoric folklore)\n\nFrom 600 BC onward, legends of talking bronze and clay statues coming to life have been a regular occurrence in the works of classical authors such as Homer, Plato, Pindar, Tacitus, and Pliny. In Book 18 of the Iliad, Hephaestus the god of all mechanical arts, was assisted by two moving female statues made from gold – \"living young damsels, filled with minds and wisdoms\". Another legend has Hephaestus being commanded by Zeus to create the first woman, Pandora, out of clay. The myth of Pygmalion, king of Cyprus, tells of a lonely man who sculpted his ideal woman, Galatea, from ivory, and promptly fell in love with her after the goddess Aphrodite brought her to life.\n\nThe 5th-century BCE Chinese text, the Liezi, contains a description of a humanoid machine which can sing and dance like a human. The automaton is presented to King Mu of Zhou by its inventor, but it offends the king by winking at court ladies and trying to flirt with them, so the inventor disassembles it to show the court that it is a machine. The king sees that it has artificial analogues of human organs, which are made of leather, wood, glue, and paint, and each fulfill necessary functions for its operation.\n\nTalos, bronze giant Talos in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica, 3rd century BC\n\nBrazen heads, attributed to numerous scholars involved in the introduction of Arabian science to medieval Europe, particularly Roger Bacon (13th century)\n\nGolem – The legend of the Golem, an animated man of clay, is mentioned in the Talmud. (16th century)\n\nTalus, \"iron man\" who mechanically helps Arthegall dispense justice in The Faerie Queene, the epic poem by Edmund Spenser, published in 1590\n\nOlimpia, automaton who captivates the hero Nathanael so much he wishes to marry her in E. T. A. Hoffmann's Der Sandmann (1814)\n\nArtificial human-like being created by Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818)\n\nThe Steam Man of the Prairies, Edward S. Ellis' mechanical man powered by steam (1868).\n\nOlympia in Act I of Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, based on the Hoffmann story (1881)\n\nA mechanical man run by electricity in Luis Senarens' Frank Reade and his Electric Man (1885)\n\nHadaly, a mechanical woman run by electricity, in Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's The Future Eve (1886) – the novel credited with popularizing the word \"android\"\n\n\"The Brazen Android\" by William Douglas O'Connor.

G. Wells (1897)\n\n\"The New Frankenstein\" by Ernest Edward Kellett (1899), in which an inventor creates an \"anti-phonograph\" that according to the narrator \"can give the appropriate answer to every question I put\", and installs in it a robotic female body that \"will guide herself, answer questions, talk and eat like a rational being, in fact, perform the part of a society lady.\" The android proves convincing enough to fool two suitors who wish to marry her.[2]\n\nA robot chess-player in Moxon's Master by Ambrose Bierce (first published in the San Francisco Examiner on 16 Aug. 1899)\n\nThe \"Metal Men\" automata designed by a Thomas Edison-like scientist in Gustave Le Rouge's La Conspiration des Milliardaires and two sequels (1899–1903).\n\nTik-Tok and Iron giant from L. Frank Baum's Ozma of Oz (1907). The movie Return to Oz was largely based on Ozma of Oz.\n\nR.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1921), by Karel Čapek – credited with coining the term \"robot\". In its original Czech, \"robota\" means forced labour, and is derived from \"rab\", meaning \"slave.\" R.U.R. depicts the first elaborate depiction of a machine take-over. Čapek's robots can also be seen as the first androids: they are in fact organic.\n\nGaston Leroux's 1923 La Poupée Sanglante (The Bloody Doll) and La Machine à Assassiner (The Murdering Machine). The lead character, Bénédict Masson, is wrongly accused of murder and guillotined. His brain is later attached to an automaton created by scientist Jacques Cotentin, and Masson goes on to track and punish those who caused his death.\n\nLe Singe (The Monkey) (1925), by Maurice Renard and Albert Jean, imagined the creation of artificial lifeforms through the process of \"radiogenesis\", a sort of human electrocopying or cloning process.\n\nThe Metal Giants (1926), by Edmond Hamilton, in which a computer brain who runs on atomic power creates an army of 300-foot-tall robots.\n\nMetropolis (1927), by Thea von Harbou, adapted by Fritz Lang on film, featuring character Maria and her robot double.\n\nAutomata (1929), by S.

It was designed by HP engineers for the express purpose of sexually pleasing humans. Comedy Bang! Bang! host Scott Aukerman was sent Little Button Puss as part of a promotional advertising campaign for the line of sex-robots. Little Button Puss looks like a metal dog, and has small flesh patches where its genitals are. Elsewhere, it's described as having the appearance of \"nickel blue, gun metal\". It is verified in the episode that Scott Aukerman lustily removed Little Button Puss' retractable genitals, threw them in a trash can, and then proceeded to use the HPDP69-B for its intended purpose. Afterwards, according to Comedy Bang! Bang! official canon, Aukerman looked back on the incident with shame. A complaint about the HPDP69-B is that for a sex-robot, \"it looks too much like a metal dog\".
