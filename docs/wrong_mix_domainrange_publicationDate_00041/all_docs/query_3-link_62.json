        "text": "Postmodernism has been referred to as a “major symptom of Late Capitalism”. Fragmentation is seen as a sign of being lost in a world of globalization and of mass communication where there&#39;s no longer an obvious &quot;centre&quot; and space isn&#39;t easily mapped. However, when this extension of a late capitalist society is aided by unharnessed technology, it moves beyond abandoning just the traditional values and everything associated with the term God. It initiates the process of creating a Virtual Overarching system that slowly controls the human consciousness and is gradually transformed into a Technological Dystopia where the lines between the Virtual and the Actual are blurred. Virtual Reality, with no tangible existence, exists in a way that it affects everything else that existed prior to it. This Virtual Reality finds a place in an important Sub-genre of Science Fiction, The Cyberpunk Literature. Cyberpunk explores posthuman identities primarily through the representati...\n\nIn today's postmodern world, the distinction between the real and the unreal has become confusing. This confusion is due to the impact of new media information and cybernetic technology; as a result, our personal and social life have gone under fundamental changes. Our lives have been affected by unreal images and information. We are being deceived by \"Absolute Fake\". Philip K. Dick in his novel portrays techno-consumer world with strange forms of media and technology that lead to hyperreality, and simulation. Dick's stories typically focus on the fragile nature of reality and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies as the main characters slowly discover their everyday world is actually an illusion. Philip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? illustrates a futuristic world where the creation of the android leads to a blurring of the line between the human and the android. Dick's oeuvre wants to answer to two major questions: \"what is reality?\" and \"what is human being?\" The philosophical guide for the purpose of looking into Dick's novel is Jean Baudrillard's concepts of simulation, simulacra and hyperreality. Simulacra to Baudrillard is more real than real; it is hyperreal. The hyperreal is simulation and simulation is a copy of copy which is removed from the original and even replaced by the original. Baudrillard argues that the hyperreal world offers fake as a reality. He believes that in techno-consumer culture the models, images, and codes come to control our thoughts and behaviors. In this novel, although characters consider technology and media information as a source of achieving reality, by reading Baudriallrd's theory, this research wants to show that, there is no such a thing as reality and characters just slip into hyperreality which disintegrate their identities.\n\nIn today’s postmodern world, the distinction between the real and the unreal has become confusing.

(1968), most critics avoid this topic, debating instead the novel’s treatment of “authentic” human subjectivity. To address this gap, this article aligns the novel’s much discussed binaries—human/android, authentic/artificial—with the its principal but overlooked concerns: trauma and ethics. Dick uses his fictional post-apocalyptic culture to articulate and critique cultural practices of trauma-deferment, which displace the effects of trauma onto the illusory model of a testable, privileged anthropocentric humanism. These deferment practices postpone the realization that the human has always already been the posthuman. In order to keep the myth of human exceptionalism alive, the animal and the android become part of an ideological dialectic that defers traumatic experience by reifying the essential human as superior to the android (who cannot empathize) and empathetic toward the animal (whose vulnerability necessitates human care). Engaging recent developments in posthuman theory, I argue that, in Do Androids Dream?, unmediated traumatic encounters perform a temporary erasure of the essentialized human subject, which, in turn, opens humans up to trans-subjective engagements with the android and the animal that facilitate a radical posthuman ethics of expansive vulnerability."
