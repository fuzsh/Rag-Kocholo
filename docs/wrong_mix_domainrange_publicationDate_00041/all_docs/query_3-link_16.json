        "text": "Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott follows a blade runner, or android bounty hunter, named Deckard as he tries to retire six replicants who have escaped from their planet to hideout on Earth. It is based on a book written by Philip K. Dick called Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?; however, the purpose of the book and that of the film are different, and that is what causes the differences between the two. The purpose of the book being to convey a message and the purpose of the film being entertainment.\n\nFirst, I want to clarify some things that were not explained very well, mainly the situation with the Earth. A couple times in the movie there are references to animatronic animals and animals come up multiple times. Basically, following some sort of nuclear war, the Earth is covered with a radioactive dust making it toxic to animals and humans. Because of this, most animal species are extinct causing fake, robotic animals with the exact same properties as the real ones to be created and the price of real animals to skyrocket. Also due to the dust, most people have left Earth leaving only the “specials,” or those with disabilities caused by the dust, and the bounty hunters, called “blade runners” in the movie. Lastly, the only difference between the replicants and humans is that they lack empathy, so the bounty hunters use the Voigt-Kampf test to gauge the empathetic response of the test taker.\n\nIn the book, Deckard starts out hating androids. It is, after all, his job to kill (or retire to make it sound better) the androids, but where most people would have some sort of emotional response to killing something that is almost human, he has none. Throughout the book, however, he begins to feel empathy for the androids through his relationship with Rachel and his run-in with the singer Luba Loft (Zhora in Blade Runner) and Pris who is modeled after Rachel. In the end it is very difficult for him to kill the androids, especially the female ones. But in the film adaptation, we get no insight into Deckard’s thoughts on androids or his emotional response as he kills them. He goes about retiring them as if it is just a normal job that is not causing him any kind of internal struggle. The movie would probably fall into the action genre, and most people who want to see an action movie don’t want any kind of morals or emotions getting in the way of their fighting, so all of the deeper things were removed.\n\nAlong with the changed purpose and somewhat changed plot also came a changed title: Blade Runner. Obviously it is called Blade Runner because that is the name of the people who track down and retire the replicants, but we are never told why they are called this or what it means. Scott almost had no choice but to change the title because the whole animatronic animal subplot was removed from the movie so people would be puzzled by the mention of electric sheep. The original title also isn’t very exciting, just the words “Blade Runner” entice me and get me ready for action, which there is certainly much more of in the movie than there was in the book. The whole ending sequence is a construct of the movie as the book ended with Deckard basically just walking in, killing everything (but being somewhat upset about it), and leaving. Not a very suitable ending for a good ending for an action movie.\n\nBlade Runner is clearly based off of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? in that most of the names are the same and the plot is similar. But in trying to be an exciting, entertaining action movie that would score big in the box office, the movie dumped the deeper meaning and ultimately the entire argument of the book along with Deckard’s internal struggle in favor of fight sequences and romance."
