The bellows were designed for the latter function and give the machine the menacing air of a sinister insect. The VK is used primarily by Blade Runners to determine if a suspect is truly human by measuring the degree of his empathic response through carefully worded questions and statements. – Description from the original press kit.

But people loved it. His secretary, who knew how it was made, requested private chats with it. It was touted as the future of psychology. This horrified Weizenbaum, who spent the rest of his career warning us of the dangers of computers.

The experiment is intended to help refute a philosophical position that Searle named "strong AI”: "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds." The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological machine being intelligent is incoherent.

In 2011 a University of Calgary test found that subjects were quick to assign emotions and intentions to a piece of balsa wood operated with a joystick. In other words, we are so hardwired for empathy that our brains are willing to make the leap to humanizing a piece of wood. It’s a level of animal instinct that’s slapstick-hilarious and a degree of vulnerability that’s terrifying.

If a robot’s artificial emotions prompt it to say things such as ‘I love you,’ surely we should be willing to accept these statements at face value … Why, if a robot that we know to be emotionally intelligent, says, ‘I love you’ or ‘I want to make love to you,’ should we doubt it?” Human emotions, he argues, are no less “programmed” than those of an intelligent machine: “We have hormones, we have neurons, and we are ‘wired’ in a way that creates our emotions.” … the differences between human and android may be “no greater than the cultural differences between peoples from different countries or even from different parts of the same country.”

He says the Japanese government expects the market for interactive and service robots to reach $50 billion in value by 2035, and envisions jobs for them in healthcare, education, retail and tourism. "Robot teachers in Japan would be better than human teachers," he said. "Japanese students are too shy to talk to a human teacher but not when it is a robot."

Fan came to see Go in an entirely new way. Against other humans, he started winning more—including four straight games against top players. His ranking shot up. AlphaGo was training him. AlphaGo’s AI tech could drive a new kind of scientific research, where machines point humans toward the next big breakthrough. At the time, without evidence, those claims rang a bit hollow—typical tech hype. But not anymore. The machine did a very human thing even better than a human. But in the process it made those humans better at what they do. Yes, you could see Move 37 as an early sign of machines asserting their superiority to their human creators. Or you could see it as a seed: Without Move 37, we wouldn’t have Move 78.

Who is responsible for the actions of AI? How should liability be determined for their mistakes? Can a legal system designed by humans keep pace with activities produced by an AI capable of outthinking and potentially outmaneuvering them? The Enlightenment started with essentially philosophical insights spread by a new technology. Our period is moving in the opposite direction. It has generated a potentially dominating technology in search of a guiding philosophy. https://w w w .theatlantic.com /m agazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-m ean-the-end-of-hum an-history/559124/

For Pransky, it's a mix of (limited) coaching for bots (in the case of Val) as well as consulting with their makers to help improve interactions and build relationships between humans and robots. https://w w w .techrepublic.com /article/is-the-w orld-ready-for-a-robot-psychiatrist-a-conversation-w ith-joanne-pransky/ "My main concern is that humans will begin lacking social skills. The upcoming generation is not going to have the basis for these skills. They will need to understand how to be social, the qualities of being social, the benefits of being with people." Pransky also worries about how "communicating indirectly all day via robot-related technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, three-dimensional avatars," will affect us. "How will we be able to tell the difference between reality and non-reality? I think that our society should be giving more emphasis in education on human social and emotional intelligence."

"But once it becomes very large, and it has thousands of units per layer and maybe hundreds of layers, then it becomes quite un-understandable." That means a driverless car, like Nvidia's, could soar headfirst into a tree and we would have no idea why it decided to do so. Joel Dudley, who led the project at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, said the machine was inexplicably good at recognising schizophrenia - but no-one knew why. “We can build these models, but we don’t know how they work,” he said. https://w w w .thesun.co.uk/tech/3306890/hum anity-is-already-losing-control-of-artificial-intelligence-and-it-could-spell-disaster-for-our-species/

For me, that is absolutely a call to say it'll be good to have more women; in some places, it'll be good to have any women. Not just more women, but also people who come from different economic and cultural backgrounds. People from different interdisciplinary backgrounds are hugely important for the next wave of technology. You need to have people who are historians and philosophers and even poets. There has to be this capacity to think differently about data, time, history and logic. It requires as many different ways of thinking as you can possibly tolerate.

122. 06.Jul.2018 CYBER+CIPHER+CULTURE – VII LISBONSUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE STUDY OF CULTURE 122 • SENTIENCE VS INTELLIGENCE • • https://w w w .huffingtonpost.com /quora/the-cultural-significance_b_13631574.htm l?guccounter=1 One reason is that if we believe it is possible that a machine one day could actually be sentient, then we would have a moral obligation to treat it as such. But it how can we distinguish a truly sentient machine from a seemingly sentient one? A more immediate concern (and relevant to our well-being, not the machine’s) is that sentient-seeming machines have the potential to be quite manipulative. We come to care about their (apparent) opinion of us, and they can be programmed to have subtle expressions. And finally - and this was at the heart of Weizenbaum’s appalled reaction - what does it mean to not care about the sentience of one’s therapist or companion, to care only how it responds to you, not why? Part of our relationship with other humans is caring how they perceive us, whether they like us, respect us, are laughing with us or at us — we care not just what they say but how they feel. When we equate a relationship with an intelligent- seeming but not sentient machine with one with an actually sentient being, we have made an enormous (and I would argue erroneous) leap into a world in which only appearance and behavior matter.

Such a design would create a mind that follows no cultural norms and thus has no culture. ” Marvin Minsky http://w eb.m edia.m it.edu/~m insky/ … when technology spreads from one culture to another its effects are varied but largely homogenizing. In many cases, the specific use of a technology can cause the displacement of a large variety of previous solutions that existed across cultures. … a robot with an artificial intelligence will be continuously exposed to existing and new technologies that could change their own culture. However, since many contradictions exist between cultures, the robot would be challenged to decide which values or goals to adopt. Magnuson, B., & Gleitzman, B. (2008).

Between generations, the most highly ranked cultural values can differ substantially, but in transmitting values from one robot to another – if that is the course ultimately chosen for value transmission between robots – we may want to encourage lower ranked values to remain unfavored. In this way, the process by which one might avoid the mistakes or value choices that were found to be negative for one’s parents can be transferred to a robotic intelligence. … we can suggest that our robotic intelligence may wish to draw a distinction between generations and ages. Might we want younger robots to “rebel” against their older counterparts, placing hedonism and self-direction as higher values? Or, should we create a robotic culture that avoids this value change, and instead transmits the “adult” values directly from one individual to another? Magnuson, B., & Gleitzman, B. (2008). The Culture of Artificial Intelligence.
