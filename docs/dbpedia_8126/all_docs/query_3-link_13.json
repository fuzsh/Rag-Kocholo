        "text": "Art can be defined as the human ability to create things that have form and beauty. By this definition, surgeons are artists and surgery itself is an art form. While we are steeped in the sciences during training, we must deploy our creative side in effecting a successful operation. As stated by Stephen Covey in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, we must begin with the end in mind. In concrete terms, our first step is to see the problem: a shattered joint, arthritic destruction, congenital abnormalities. We then must visualize the desired end result and identify the steps that will be required in order to achieve it. Surgical skills, developed through repetition, then create the resulting art form.\n\nSurgeon-artists also have advanced the field of orthopaedics through visualizing and creating new procedures and products. This creativity is a transferable asset that pays dividends in life beyond our career as orthopaedic surgeons. My career ended several years earlier than anticipated due to the pandemic. In March of 2020, I was furloughed from my position covering orthopaedic trauma. Rediscovering a passion for art became therapeutic for me and allowed me to focus on something other than my career. As an orthopaedic surgeon who had originally focused on sports medicine, I had already experienced a career change by transitioning into orthopaedic trauma surgery. The resulting change in the call and work schedule allowed for the beginning of exploration with oils and canvas. I delved into painting abstract pieces, scenes of places visited, and even pets of colleagues. Abstract paintings were a natural attraction as I don’t feel capable enough to paint in a realism vein. I brought an empty mind to an empty canvas. The benefits of emptying myself before painting had the salutary effect of allowing me to escape the responsibilities and worries of daily patient management, administrative duties, and financial strains. Internal struggles and feelings found expression on the canvas. Not only did I find satisfaction in most of my creations, I emerged from the basement studio more relaxed and more pleasant to be around. The sudden increase in available time with the furlough and eventual retirement were then filled with activities, including painting, that had previously provided ballast in my life. I had guarded my private time and activities religiously during an active career in orthopaedics. These pursuits eased the transition to an off-ramp from orthopaedic surgery.\n\nDeveloping the creative side within can propel us forward, whatever our pursuits. In The Art of Impossible, Steven Kotler describes the intrinsic motivators that are instrumental for achieving success, including curiosity, passion, meaning, purpose, mastery, and autonomy. I suggest that these drivers reflect the creative and artistic realm of our being. Pursuing the arts, whether in writing, painting, poetry, or photography, can provide balance in a career. I encourage younger surgeons to create the space that is needed to allow artistic curiosity to flourish. The arts will facilitate current success and will prepare one for a future outside of medicine.\n\nWith that, I submit 2 of my works: “Untitled, 2020” and “Sailboats in the BVI.” “Untitled, 2020” represents the chaos and lack of focus early in the pandemic. “Sailboats in the BVI” is more hopeful and represents a laser focus on the racing marker that lies ahead during a regatta in my beloved British Virgin Islands.\n\nEnjoy, and delve into your creative side."
