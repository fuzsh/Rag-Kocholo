        "text": "A Singular Program Where Voice Science and Art Meet\n\nThe Doctor of Musical Arts in Pedagogy (Voice) at Shenandoah University is the only one of its kind, open to singers of all styles, with no classical music audition requirements. It is also the only program to offer both.\n\nThe Doctor of Musical Arts in Pedagogy (Voice) degree prepares students for academic and non-academic (alt-ac) careers in a world where cross-training is a necessity. Those interested in pursuing higher education careers will be prepared to teach, research and lead academic programs. Those interested in alt-ac careers will have the skills necessary to run highly successful private studios, non-profit organizations and/or join a voice care team.\n\nStudents gain advanced knowledge through an interdisciplinary approach in areas of anatomy, physiology, technology and applied voice. Classical and contemporary commercial music voice techniques are incorporated throughout the curriculum to make sure you are ready to help any singer who enters your studio. Classes such as anatomy and physiology (including time in our state-of-the-art cadaver lab), voice disorders, body awareness, teaching practicum, technology in the studio, research design and two years of private voice lessons prepare students to be well-rounded practitioners who are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities facing singers in the 21st century.\n\nWhen it is time to write your traditional or three article dissertation, you will have the opportunity to study the topic of your choice to set the course of your career as an expert in the field. Our D.M.A. students have embraced diverse dissertation topics including the the menopausal voice, laryngopharyngeal reflux, performance anxiety, contemporary Christian music, Gospel squall, formant tuning in baritone voices, voice training for music therapists, vocal function exercises for musical theatre singers, gender bias in vocal literature, temporomandibular joint disorders and the impact of voice lessons on patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\nIf you are looking for a place where you can transform your teaching under the guidance of knowledgeable and caring faculty that truly want to see you succeed, then apply for the Doctor of Musical Arts in Pedagogy (Voice) at Shenandoah Conservatory. Auditions slots fill quickly; applicants are encouraged to apply by December 1. The application deadline is January 15 or when all audition slots are full.\n\nLeadership & Voice Science Tracks\n\nLeadership Track\n\nThe Leadership cognate area of specialization within the doctorate degree affords students the opportunity to broaden the direction of their professional interests. These courses in curriculum development and administration prepare students for employment in an industry that is rapidly changing. This track is ideal for those who are interested in developing new degrees, improving existing degrees, working in administration, or developing educational programs outside of academia. Those embarking on a traditional career trajectory will gain new insight about the challenges facing educators in the 21st century and will be well prepared to contribute to broader conversations in their institution and the profession.\n\nVoice Science Track\n\nThe Voice Science cognate area of specialization within the doctorate degree affords students the opportunity to choose a traditional research path for their doctoral dissertation. The courses in this cognate all have components for strengthening research design. This track is ideal for those who want to pursue high-level voice research, who want to collaborate with laryngologists and speech-language pathologists as part of a voice care team, as well as those who want to start new voice pedagogy programs and/or develop a voice research center at their institution.\n\nView Full Pedagogy Curriculum\n\nJanette E. Ogg Voice Research Center (JOVRC)\n\nThe internationally recognized Janette E. Ogg Voice Research Center serves as a central hub for our voice pedagogy students.
