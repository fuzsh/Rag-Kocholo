The purpose of submitting a résumé is to provide the Admissions Committee with a document that quickly sums up your background and accomplishments. The résumé should contain lists, not full prose paragraphs such as in a program bio. The elements to include in your résumé are as follows:\n\nYour name and major (violin, jazz trumpet, soprano, etc.)\n\nYour contact information (including address, phone, and email)\n\nEducation: Where you studied, degree or diploma earned (or to be earned)\n\nTeachers: Particularly for classical instrumentalists and vocalists, listing your most recent teachers and the dates when you studied with them is important information for the Committee\n\nMaster classes where you performed: List teacher and date (for example, June 2020)\n\nEnsemble experience: Youth orchestras, choirs, jazz bands, etc.\n\nCompetitions and awards: Include dates\n\nPerformances: If including orchestral performances, only include those if you were the soloist; otherwise list recitals and chamber music performances\n\nOther experience: If you have done volunteer work, held a job, etc., those can be listed here\n\nYou do not have to use these exact categories in this exact order. Use what is logical for your background, but make sure to put your name at the top of the document, and include your education and your teachers. DO NOT SUBMIT A PROGRAM BIO. It is not useful for purposes of applying to Juilliard.\n\nYour Dossier\n\nA dossier is defined as a collection of files and materials on the same subject. For musicians, this is a combination of performance and biographical materials that can be used for promotional and professional uses and is similar to an Electronic Press Kit.\n\nYour dossier should include the following, as appropriate:\n\na program bio\n\nA program bio can include your background information, performance and education experience, career highlights and achievements, and any additional descriptions about your musical style.\n\na representative repertoire list from the past two years, including examples of important works from the contemporary literature\n\nThe representative repertoire list should include the pieces you have performed within the last two years, along with contemporary and classical literature in your repertory.\n\npress clippings/reviews\n\nAs part of the dossier, you may include press clippings or reviews from any performances or recordings that received media coverage.

Please note that you will not be able to upload the dossier until you have received an official audition invitation.\n\nYour Essay(s)\n\nJuilliard’s Admissions Committee uses your essay(s) to learn more about you as an individual and gain a sense of who you are beyond your application, transcript, and audition.\n\nEssay Requirements\n\n1–2 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font\n\nwritten in English (not translated from another language)\n\nmust be your own original work\n\nsubmitted within the online application\n\nTopics\n\nYou must provide an essay on both of the following topics:\n\nMany artists experience a moment that crystallizes their career goals. Describe what that moment was for you. Give us specific details about the setting, about what you were doing at the time, and about how that moment continues to affect your actions to this day.\n\nExplain your motivation for pursuing the D.M.A. degree and how your experience in the doctoral program will be relevant to your performing and/or academic career.\n\nAdditional Essay Requirements\n\nAdditional essays are required for:\n\nFormerly Enrolled Juilliard Students\n\nCurrently Enrolled Juilliard Students\n\nRequired Graded Paper\n\nAll DMA applicants are required to submit a graded academic paper by uploading the PDF to your application status page by February 16. The paper must be written in English, must have been written in the final year of the applicant's current or most recent program, and must be at least 1,200 words in length. The subject must be a musical or general humanities topic; papers on scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical topics are not acceptable. Please include instructor comments if not evident on paper itself.\n\nOptional Essay\n\nShould you have a personal or academic circumstance to share that you feel can provide context for a particular point on your resume - for example, a gap year, unusually low grades in a semester or year, etc. - you have the option to submit an additional short essay.\n\nYour Introduction Video\n\nA one-minute video uploaded to the application in which you record yourself giving the following information:\n\nYour name\n\nYour major (i.e. flute, composition, organ). Voice applicants: please include your voice type\n\nYour current music teacher\n\nYour current school and grade level\n\nOne fact that you want the Admissions Committee to know about you that they cannot learn from your application materials AND\n\nTell us about one piece of music that excites you and why.\n\nTo record your video, navigate to the \"Music Introduction Video\" tab in your application. There you will find instructions for starting the recording. Because the video will be recorded directly from the application, not uploaded as a video file, we recommend allowing yourself ample time to prepare and test your recording in the application module. You can record and save your video at any time before submitting your application, and can delete and re-record your video as needed prior to submission. You will need to use a computer (any type) or cell phone (Android only) with a webcam and a browser that supports media recording (Chrome and Firefox). At this time, video recording is not supported on iPhones or iPads. If you have any trouble with the video recording module, please call or email the Office of Admissions.\n\nYour Transcripts\n\nTranscripts are an important component of the decision process. They help us determine if you have sufficient scholastic competence to succeed in coursework at the level for which you are applying. Please send your transcript by the requested deadline found in the application timeline above.\n\nThe Juilliard School accepts both official and unofficial transcripts during the application process. Students who are admitted and plan to enroll in the fall will be required to submit a final official transcript of their studies.\n\nWe understand that the current academic year has not ended, and that, if you are currently enrolled, you have not yet completed your program. Please submit your incomplete transcript as is by the deadline; an official final transcript will be required later, if you are admitted and choose to enroll.\n\nYou may view the status of transcripts at any time by logging into your application account. Please note that it may take the Office of Admissions up to 7 business days to process your transcript after it has been received\n\nUnofficial versus Official Transcripts\n\nAn unofficial transcript is one that you upload to your application or status page.\n\nIn addition to what is listed below in Transcript Requirements, unofficial transcripts must include your name and the name of your institution.\n\nUnofficial transcripts must be uploaded to your application or status page as a PDF.\n\nAn official transcript is one that is sent from your school directly to Juilliard. You should follow the process outlined by the Office of the Registrar at your school. If your school does not have an Office of the Registrar, please work with the school department or administrator that oversees course registration, grades, and the conferral of degrees.\n\nMany schools use secure electronic sending services such as National Student Clearinghouse, Parchment, eSCRIP-SAFE, or other systems. Electronic sending services must use this email address: [email protected].\n\nAlternatively, your school can send us your official transcript via regular or express mail. Mailed transcripts must be sent in a sealed envelope directly from the issuing institution(s) to the Juilliard Office of Admissions.\n\nOffice of Admissions\n\nThe Juilliard School\n\n60 Lincoln Center Plaza\n\nNew York, NY 10023\n\nTranscript Requirements\n\nYour transcript(s) must show all prior and current post-secondary coursework.\n\nFor students studying outside of the United States, your coursework must be equivalent or similar to a U.S. undergraduate curriculum. Typically, this includes at least 24 credits of liberal arts courses.\n\nYou will be notified if an official evaluation of your transcript is required in order to verify your academic level. Companies such as The Evaluation Company (use this link for a discounted evaluation: SpanTran Pathway - The Juilliard School), WES, or ECE can provide this service for a fee.\n\nIf you are pursuing post-graduate studies, you must send us both your undergraduate and graduate transcripts.\n\nIf you have already completed your program of study, your transcript must also include the degree/diploma conferred and your graduation/completion date.\n\nIf your transcript is not in English, we require the transcript in its original language as well as a certified translation.\n\nYour Recommendations\n\nIn your application you will be required to identify two individuals who will provide your recommendations. The recommendations should address your academic and performance potential for the Doctor of Musical Arts program.*\n\n*Please note that currently enrolled Juilliard students are also required to have two letters of recommendation in support of their application. These letters can come from internal faculty members or those not affiliated with The Juilliard School.\n\nThe recommendations themselves are not due until later in the application timeline. Recommenders will receive an email with a link to securely upload their letters to our application system. We will only accept recommendations received through our application system.\n\nYou may view the status of recommendations at any time by logging into yourapplication account.\n\nYour Teacher Preferences\n\nA key element of your study at Juilliard is your major teacher assignment. Music students receive 15 one-hour lessons per semester with a Juilliard studio faculty member.\n\nHow to Indicate Your Preferences\n\nYou are required to submit your teacher preferences through the online application\n\nIf your preferences change, you can update your selections through your application status page\n\nHow Your Preferences are Used\n\nYour teacher preferences are confidential and do not affect admissions decisions. Studio faculty are not advised of teacher preference selections until after admission decisions are finalized by the committee\n\nWe aim to confirm studio assignments with notification of admission\n\nIf admitted, your teacher assignment will be based on your preferences to the greatest extent possible. No teacher assignment can be made without a documented request for a specific teacher\n\nResearching Teachers\n\nIf you are not familiar with our faculty, we strongly recommend researching the teachers in your major prior to the application deadline, as follows:\n\nReview the teachers’ online bios in our directory and listen to recordings of each artist\n\nAsk your current teacher(s) for recommendations\n\nConsult with friends who may have studied with them\n\nOptional: Set up a meeting or lesson with the teacher(s). Although not all faculty are available to meet with applicants due to their teaching and performing commitments, you may use this form to request contact information for up to four teachers. Scheduling the meeting and payment of any lesson or meeting fee is your responsibility.\n\nScholarship & Financial Aid Forms\n\nThis program provides a scholarship for the full cost of tuition plus a small stipend. If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you may apply for federal student loans to assist with additional required fees and living expenses by completing the FAFSA.\n\nVisit the Office of Financial Aid for more information.\n\nPrescreening\n\nPrescreening Type\n\nFormat\n\nYou are required to upload your files in a Video format.

We recommend that .mov files be converted to another accepted format to avoid uploading difficulties.\n\nWe support media files as large as 5GB, but please be advised that larger files will take longer to upload from your Internet connection and may stall if you are on a wireless connection or one that cannot sustain a connection for the necessary period of time.\n\nPrescreening Requirements\n\nYour major is required to submit prescreening recordings within the online application by the appropriate deadline.\n\nProcedures\n\nUpload and arrange your recordings so that the file that represents your best work is first.\n\nIndividual movements or excerpts should be uploaded as separate digital files.\n\nClearly label each of the uploaded files with the name of the composer and work/movement.\n\nComplete your uploads well in advance of the appropriate deadline, as upload times vary depending on file size and internet signal strength.\n\nInsufficient or incomplete audition repertoire may affect consideration for admission.\n\nWhere specific works are required, substitutions are not allowed.\n\nPlease note that audition requirements which state a complete piece or work are indicating all movements must be prepared.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the prescreening requirements listed below, all works written with accompaniment must be accompanied for your recording.\n\nQuality\n\nPlease note that submitted prescreening recordings do not need to be filmed in a particular setting. Videos filmed in a practice room, a living room, a concert hall, a recording studio, or any other setting may be submitted.\n\nRecordings must be genuinely performed by you. Composition applicants: live recordings of your works may include others.\n\nRecordings must not be edited, nor should any effects such as “reverb” be added.\n\nPlay back and check your entire recording for any distortion or excessive “buzz”.\n\nIf accompaniment is required, ensure that it does not drown out your playing.\n\nReview your recordings before uploading to ensure that they are of good quality and represent your best work to date.\n\nYou will be notified as to whether or not you have passed the prescreening round by the date on the application timeline.

Repertoire and pedagogical choices can often grow out of habit and a narrowness of knowledge, shaped by a history of exclusion and diminished voices. In the Music Division, we are taking important steps to broaden our knowledge by creating a faculty-researched list of works by Black composers to embrace and work toward a more representative world of classical music. When you have an elective choice, we encourage you to include a work in your audition repertoire by a composer from historically underrepresented gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural heritages.\n\nMusic by Black Composers: An Introductory Resource\n\nWe are also happy to recommend the following as additional resources that expand our knowledge of a wider breadth of repertoire:\n\nInstitute for Composer Diversity Database\n\nMusic by Black Composers Database\n\nAs part of the online application, you are required to submit your proposed audition repertoire for review and approval.

Audition day details, including practice room availability, will be sent prior to your audition\n\nVideo auditions are not accepted\n\nAudition Repertoire\n\nFall 2024 Auditions\n\nMusic auditions at The Juilliard School are held in person on our New York City campus; limited funds are available for need-based travel grants. All applicants invited to audition are expected to attend on their scheduled date and time, and are expected to have the entire audition repertoire prepared. While faculty may not hear entire works, they may ask you to perform any part of a required work.\n\nAccommodations (that is, alternatives to in-person auditions) will be made only for extraordinary circumstances. These circumstances include pandemic lockdowns, a positive COVID test, quarantines, and travel and visa restrictions. All accommodations must be requested using the form provided by the Office of Admissions, and must be approved by the Office of Admissions.
