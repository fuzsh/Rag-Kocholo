        "text": "The Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) program is designed for performers and composers who have already reached a high level of proficiency and artistry in their fields and who may wish to teach at the university level.\n\nThis program offers an opportunity to bring creative and performance achievement to a high level while enriching individual backgrounds with cognitive studies.\n\nCandidates in music performance are expected to pursue supplementary individual projects in performance practice and music literature. Studies in music theory and music history are included.\n\nGraduate student composers work closely with faculty in composition and music theory and are expected to compose major works for public performance in addition to fulfilling course requirements."
