        "text": "The DMA degree programs at CU Boulder are modeled after the guiding principles outlined by the National Association of Schools of Music. As defined by the NASM, the Doctor of Musical Arts degree is intended for those seeking “the highest level of professional practice emphasizing the creation or performance of musical works and the application and transmission of knowledge about musical works, or pedagogy... Creation, performance, and teaching are highly disciplined efforts; inquiry and investigation, and often research and scholarship, are components of performance practice” (NASM Handbook, 2016-17: 135).\n\nThis professional degree is intended for composers, conductors and performers who possess both creative and scholarly abilities. Graduates of this program go on to careers as composers and performers in solo, chamber music, opera, jazz or orchestra, or as choral, jazz, band and/or orchestral conductors. A particular focus of the DMA is the preparation for a career as a college, conservatory or university teacher. Students work closely with an advisor in developing a degree plan that reflects their needs and interests. This degree requires a minimum of 30 hours beyond the master’s level, including 12 hours in seminar and other coursework, and a minimum of 18 hours of performance and written projects (constituting the dissertation portion of the degree).\n\nFor outlines of specific programs, visit the college's Degrees webpage or contact the Music Graduate Studies office.\n\nRequirements\n\nPrerequisites\n\nEntrance requirements include a master's degree in music or demonstrated background comparable to that of the master of music degree at this university. All graduate applicants must complete an audition, interview, or some other demonstration of their ability in the major field. If at all possible, a visit to the campus is strongly encouraged. As part of the application, composition majors should upload representative scores and recordings (to the digital portfolio tab on the application), and a list of completed compositions. Performance majors should submit a repertoire list and arrange for a personal audition and interview, if at all possible. Some areas require applicants to send a pre-audition screening recording of their performance. Conducting majors must upload a video of a performance. All DMA applicants must also submit a scholarly writing sample that demonstrates ability in critical thinking, appropriate research techniques, and skill in the cogent use of English. For full details concerning audition and application requirements, visit the college's Prospective Graduate Students webpage.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nStudents must take a minimum of 30 credit hours of coursework, of which at least 18 credit hours are dissertation projects. Students take two doctoral topic classes (at the 6000 level), one each in musicology and music theory; prerequisites are stipulated by the theory and musicology faculties. Some areas require specific coursework prior to or in conjunction with work on dissertation projects. In other instances students may be advised to take coursework in preparation for the comprehensive examination. Applied music instruction may be elected for the duration of the residency requirement.\n\nAdvisory Committee\n\nEach DMA program is directed by a five-member advisory committee headed by the major advisor, who is usually the student's main studio teacher. At least one member must hold the PhD degree in musicology, music theory, composition or music education.\n\nResidence Requirements\n\nThe minimum residence requirement is six semesters of work beyond the attainment of an acceptable bachelor's degree. Two semesters of residence credit may be allowed for a master's degree from another institution of approved standing, but at least four semesters of residence credit, two of which must be consecutive in one academic year, must be earned for coursework and/or dissertation work taken at this university.\n\nNot more than one-half semester of residence credit may be earned in a summer session. Students must be registered full-time to earn residence credit. For employed students, only those with one-fourth time or less in work that does not contribute directly to their degree program may earn full residence credit.\n\nContinuous Registration\n\nAfter the residence requirements for the doctor of musical arts program have been satisfied, a student must enroll for fall and spring semesters of each year until attaining the degree. If a student has enrolled in all required dissertation courses but is still working on dissertation projects to complete the degree requirements, they should enroll in TMUS 8019, or TMUS 8029, until the degree is completed.\n\nDegree Plans\n\nA degree plan approved by the advisory committee will be presented to the associate dean for graduate studies at the beginning of the second semester of residence. The student's major professor is responsible for helping the student formulate this plan. The plan should include members of the student's doctoral committee, projected remedial and supporting coursework, proposed dissertation projects, and tentative dates for the comprehensive and final examinations. In consultation with the major advisor, the student should form the five-member faculty advisory committee by the third semester in residence.\n\nThe following degree plans are available for the doctor of musical arts degree:\n\nBrass Performance and Pedagogy\n\nPercussion Performance and Pedagogy\n\nComposition\n\nConducting and Literature - Choral\n\nConducting and Literature - Orchestral\n\nConducting and Literature - Wind\n\nJazz Performance\n\nSolo Piano - Thesis\n\nSolo Piano - Non-thesis\n\nCollaborative Piano\n\nString Performance\n\nVoice Performance and Pedagogy\n\nWoodwinds Performance and Pedagogy\n\nLearn more about degree plans on the College of Music's Degrees webpage.\n\nLanguage Requirement\n\nBrass + percussion; collaborative piano; choral conducting; orchestral conducting; voice; and musicology students are required to demonstrate foreign language proficiency before being allowed to take the comprehensive examination. The choice of the language(s) must be approved by the student’s advisory committee. Specific requirements include:\n\nBrass + percussion: Passing score on a foreign language repertoire terms exam\n\nCollaborative piano: instrumental emphasis: One year of French, German, or Italian; vocal emphasis: One year of two languages (selected from French, German, or Italian)\n\nChoral conducting: Two years of one language\n\nOrchestral conducting: Two years of one language\n\nVoice: One year of three languages.
