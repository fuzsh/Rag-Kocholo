        "text": "The Sydney Conservatorium of Music places a high emphasis on its research activity, with a vibrant and diverse community of staff and students. The Doctor of Musical Arts at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music is a research-based doctorate in music performance, conducting or composition open to professional-skilled musicians with strong scholarly abilities and interests. The DMA will suit candidates with a research background who wish to enhance their already high-level research and creative work abilities and experience by taking advantage of the exceptional research and teaching community available at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.\n\nStudents pursue a supervised research program leading to the submission of a thesis comprising two components:\n\n(i) a public presentation of creative work (recital, lecture recital, recording or other appropriate format), or a composition portfolio; and\n\n(ii) a written research dissertation of 25,000–35,000 words. Both components are expected to be an original contribution to the candidate's field of creative research.\n\nResearch development is supported by coursework normally taken during the first full year of candidature."
