        "text": "\"Either he's honest to a fault, or the world's greatest liar.\"\n\n— Xeno Houston Wingfield regarding Gen, Dr. Stone, Chapter 151\n\nGen Asagiri (あさぎりゲン, Asagiri Gen) is a turncoat of the Tsukasa Empire, persuaded to the side of the Kingdom of Science by Senku and the others. He is one of the Five Wise Commanders, specializing in soft skills and interpersonal strategies, but also avoiding hard work if he can help it. When it comes to enemies, Gen acts as a tactical forecaster. Kaseki tends to drag him along to help with crafting, as they are close friends.[11]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nGen is a slim young man of average height with pale skin and strong hands and not much else.[12] His hair is bicolored, with the left half being short and black and the right half being white with longer strands around his face. Prior to his petrification, all of his hair was black, but it was already partially white before becoming petrified.[13] His eyes are dark and shadowed as if with eyeliner or fatigue, and angled upwards into a sharp, cunning slant. His eyebrows are stubby, lacking a tail.\n\nHis petrification scar is a jagged mark running down from his left eye with a mouth-like wedge across his cheekbone. This line varies in appearance depending on what Gen is doing, such as becoming flower-like when mimicking a woman's voice[14] or extra jagged while scheming.[15] His petrification scar is healed by his second depetrification. After Tsukasa's revival, he used paint to recreate his scar.[16]\n\nHe wears a lavender-pink Japanese-style overcoat over a wheat-colored yukata, tied with an unhemmed and jagged brick-orange obi under a thin rope, tied at the front. Gen wears undyed but fitted pants that gather slightly at the ankles. He lacks proper footwear and walks barefoot.\n\nLater, Gen replaces his outfit with a similar overcoat over a yukata, but rather than it being laced up at the front of his neck, it's tied with a necktie, and his sash is a piece of fabric rather than rope. He also wears sack-like shoes similar to Senku's original ones.[17]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nGen is a proficient liar and skilled manipulator, with no fixed policies regarding his approach to life,[18] making him dangerous as a foe and untrustworthy as an ally. He is the self-proclaimed world's smoothest talker, and of course, he uses all these traits to reliably help his friends over and over again.\n\nHe takes pride in his abilities as both a magician, and as a mentalist, with his knowledge of the human psyche. He is a skilled actor, fiercely in control of his body and emotions even when in danger: he remains rational and calm at spear-point,[19] poleaxe-point,[20] gunpoint,[21] or deep in enemy territory, undergoing questioning.[22] He is confident and is shown to have nerves of steel, even in the face of death. In all cases, he only shows the parts of him he wants to show, owing to his manipulation tactics. However, this façade is not always present, as Gen appears to react freely in shock whenever Senku brings up his next planned invention.[23]\n\nWhile not as academically gifted as Senku, Gen shows an average understanding of modern innovations and scientific knowledge, acting as the bridge between a scientist and a layman.[24] He uses his abilities to promote cooperation and enthusiasm, motivate allies, conduct negotiations, and outsmart enemies. He tends to shift between acting as a ditzy airhead when it suits him (such as to avoid work or going into battle)[25][26] and an intelligent manipulator.\n\nHis predictive skills allow him to adapt and prepare for potential situations, such as preparing blood bags before getting beaten up by Magma.[27] These skills also allow him to choose the best path for negotiation, such as openly offering to lie to Tsukasa about Senku's death to earn his favor,[28] pretending Senku had a gift for Minami to obtain her Revival Fluid,[29], and tricking Ryusui into paying them for the privilege of being on the hot air balloon despite needing his expertise anyways.[30]\n\nHe tends to act self-absorbed and perverted, as seen when he considered sticking by Tsukasa for the purpose of having a harem, hitting on Kohaku, and later Amaryllis,[31] though he gives off a gentlemanly air even when being honest about such. While he frequently portrays an aura of selfishness, hard self-interest, manipulation, and deviousness, Gen is a good person who can't bring himself to harm others. His outward appearance is masked by his mastery in psychology, but his actions speak of loyalty, determination, kindness[32] and even sacrifice at times.\n\nHe is good with people of all ages, Kaseki being one of his cherished people whom he spends a lot of time with as Kaseki enjoys his aid.[3] He also gets along with Suika and together they succeeded in protecting the village.[33] In addition, he is also quite genuine in his admiration of others, respectfully recounting Lillian Weinberg's renowned singing skills to the people of Ishigami village in reverential tones.\n\nGen is also rather quirky, frequently hamming things up as if it were a performance and can often be seen speaking in playful Pig Latin. This comes out most prominently when he's surprised or shocked.[34]\n\nAbilities and Skills[]\n\nPsychology: As a mentalist, he is deeply perceptive and manipulative, having a large knowledge of the human psyche. He is capable of analyzing and understanding obscure messages or drawings with his great knowledge about the human mind; he was able to decipher Kohaku's message by understanding what each image represented from her point of view. Gen is also able to put himself in the minds of others, correctly figuring out what they are thinking or planning. Gen is very crafty, as he anticipated being attacked[35] and created fake blood packs to wear for a visual trick and to soften blows to his body. This saved him from being killed by Magma.\n\nSkilled Liar: Gen is an expert liar, as he can fool anyone. When it comes to post-petrification humans, Gen can easily impress and trick them into believing his tall tales. Though he is equally good at manipulating people from his era (minus Senku, whom he often collaborates with in these cases) with his showmanship, Gen has stated that the best trick of a mentalist is to \"make your joker look like the ace of spades.\" He was also able to fool a polygraph test, with only half-truths. This left Dr. Xeno amazed, even when the scientist suspected Gen of lying.[36]\n\nManipulation: Gen is shown to consistently manipulate people into getting his (or the Kingdom's) way. He has tricked Moz into not killing them and instead temporarily helping them, and during the Age of Exploration Arc, is shown using his manipulation to motivate the workers and gain the Kingdom money. His manipulation tactics are quickly seen when he goads Kinro and Ginro into helping Senku power-up an electricity generator.[37]\n\nStage Magic: Gen is a master of sleight of hand. He also keeps various props hidden within his coat, so he may cause distractions or fake \"peace offerings\" to stall. He makes use of this immediately after arriving at the village, distracting the hostile villagers planning to attack Senku.[35]\n\nImpersonation: He also makes for a very convincing female if the need to disguise himself comes up, with Kohaku stating that his only flaw was that he was too tall for a convincing woman. He is capable of mimicking people's voices to the point of being indiscernible from the original.\n\nEndurance: He shows a surprisingly strong will and a high level of endurance, being able to survive an attack from Magma with proper preparation, then, soon after, run all the way back to the Tsukasa Empire while gravely injured to report Senku's death.[38][39] He does the journey there and back again later when delivering the cell phone. However, his skills pale in comparison to Francois' endurance ability as he was left in the dust, barely able to keep up while walking with Francois back to Ishigami Village (a difficult feat without food, water, or shoes).[40]\n\nLinguistic Proficiency: He is fluent in both Japanese and English. He was able to understand Ukyo when he was speaking English through the buried phone in order to conceal their conversation from the others present and offered Senku to take over the negotiation (Chapter 73). He was able to speak to both Stanley Snyder and Dr. Xeno with no problems.[36]\n\nMorse Code: Gen knows Morse code very well, using it to communicate with Senku's team on the phone in order to ensnare Homura.[41]\n\nChapter Appearances[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nGen's last name, \"Asagiri\" (あさぎり, \"Asagiri\"), translates to morning mist/fog, but the \"asa\" could also mean \"shallow.\" His first name is the Japanese word for \"illusion,\" a reference to his penchant for magic.\n\nOn the last page of chapter 60, Gen's name is written in kanji rather than hiragana and katakana: \"asa\" (浅 (あさ) , shallow/superficial) \"giri\" (霧 (ぎり) , mist) \"gen\" (幻 (ゲン) , phantom/illusion/dream).[42] It is the only time in the manga it is written like this.\n\nSince the recreation of paper, Gen keeps a deck of crudely made cards with him all the time.\n\nIn addition to the normal 52 cards, he has three jokers.\n\nEach joker has a phrase on it, but it is unknown if the other cards do as well.\n\nIt is possible that Gen knows tarot, hence the phrases.\n\nGen's poster can be seen on a book called \"Magic Psychology,\" prior to the petrification event.[43]\n\nGen's first petrification happened while posing on a box full of swords he escaped from during a performance.[44]\n\nSimilar to Senku's hair color, Gen's hair color has varied throughout the series. It appears as blond and blue (Chapter 66 Dr. Stone Character Poll), white and brown (Chapter 25 and 104 colour pages) and blond and brown (Chapter 95 and 111 color pages, Shonen Jump Issue 31 2019, and the Viz Shonen Jump Banner of July 2019). In the anime, his hair is white and black.\n\nGen ranked 3rd in the 1st and 2nd Character Popularity Polls and placed 1st in the 3rd Character Popularity poll.\n\nGen's verbal quirk is to flip the halves of random words. For example, \"yabe\" (やべ) becomes \"beya\" (べや) or \"muri\" (無理) becomes \"rimu\" (理無).[45] In the English translations, this has been replaced with pig Latin where he most notably uses it to describe Senku's crazy plans as \"azy-cray\".\n\nGen's heterochromatic hair might be caused by a condition named \"poliosis,\" which causes a decrease or absence of melanin in affected hairy areas. This would explain why it became/remains discolored after depetrification, as well as suggest that he dyed his hair fully prior to the story's events. This is supported by the poster on the book \"Magic Psychology\"[43] where Gen's hair is fully black.\n\nGen's English voice actor is the real-life husband of Magma's voice actor.\n\nGen and Senku share opposite birthdays, with Gen being on the 01/04 (April 1st) and Senku's being on the 04/01 (January 4th).\n\nGen's scar completely vanishes after the South America arc as he stops drawing it back on, which Boichi notes to have been on purpose.[46]\n\nGen normally hides his hands and stoops his back, which makes him look shorter than he really is.[47]\n\nGen refused alcohol when offered, claiming he's \"strictly a cola man\",[48] however it's unclear if he doesn't drink it at all or if he refused because he had serious things to discuss with the villagers and \"wouldn't be able to talk business if I were drunk\".[49]\n\nGen's favorite flower to use in his magic shows and subterfuge tactics is Solanum nigrum, also known as black nightshade or hound's berry. In the language of the flowers, it means liar.[50]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nKingdom of Science Male Chrome • Gen Asagiri • Ginro • Hyoga • Joel Gear • Kaseki • Kinro • Kokuyo • Magma • Ryusui Nanami • Sai Nanami • Senku Ishigami • Taiju Oki • Tetsuya Kinomoto • Tsukasa Shishio • Ukyo Saionji • Yo Uei Female Chelsea Childe • Homura Momiji • Kohaku • Minami Hokutozai • Mirai Shishio • Nikki Hanada • Ruri • Suika • Yuzuriha Ogawa Unknown Francois Affiliated Groups American Colony • Ishigami Villagers • Petrification Kingdom"
