        "text": "Number 1 in the UK for Medicine (The Complete University Guide 2024)\n\nMedicine at Cambridge\n\nThe key to being a great clinician is combining practical skills with an excellent grounding in the science underlying practice. This course gives you just that.\n\nThe course lasts 6 years:\n\nfor the first 3 years you focus on scientific principles underlying medicine, alongside a clinical strand. You’ll also get to conduct a full-body dissection, which very few medical schools offer\n\nthe last 3 years you apply that knowledge to medical practice as a clinical student, spending much of your time learning directly from patients in GP surgeries and hospitals\n\nYou’ll also have opportunities to pursue research and project work throughout the course.\n\nThis course is for you if:\n\nit’s your first undergraduate degree\n\nit’s your second degree – you’ll complete the first half of the course in 2 years instead of 3. You can also apply to study the Medicine course for graduates.\n\nIf this is your first degree and you successfully complete the first 3 years of the course, you’ll graduate with a BA (Hons) degree.\n\nIf you successfully complete the full course, you will graduate with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MB, BChir).\n\nTeaching and facilities\n\nTeaching\n\nClinical teaching is delivered on the wards and in general practice. There are also additional opportunities to attend general and specialist outpatient clinics.\n\nThe course is based in Cambridge. Some of the course is also delivered in regional hospitals or practices, to take advantage of the different educational opportunities they offer.\n\nFacilities\n\nThis Cambridge Medical course embodies teaching from world experts, progressive technology and modern facilities.\n\nAlong with all other students at Cambridge, you'll also have access to:\n\nour impressive Cambridge University Library, one of the world’s oldest university libraries\n\nWatch the video to find out what a day in the life of a Cambridge Medicine student is like:\n\nCourse costs\n\nWhen you go to university, you’ll need to consider two main costs – your tuition fees and your living costs (sometimes referred to as maintenance costs).\n\nYour living costs will include costs related to your studies that are not covered by your tuition fees. There are some general study costs that will apply for all students – you can find details of these costs here.\n\nOther additional course costs for Medicine are detailed below. If you have any queries these costs, please contact the Department.\n\nEquipment\n\nTo buy and maintain essential equipment for the course, the estimated cost is £60. Equipment includes:\n\nUniversity approved scientific calculator\n\nLab coat\n\nSafety glasses\n\nDissecting instruments\n\nGloves\n\nYou will also need:\n\nTheatre clogs – estimated contribution £10\n\nStethoscope – estimated cost £60 to £100. This is only required for the clinical part of the course (years 4 to 6)\n\nPlacements – years 1 to 3\n\nCosts for the Preparing for Patients modules vary and are detailed below. You are expected to cover the costs detailed below, plus basic subsistence costs.\n\nPreparing for Patients A (year 1) – travel costs, approximately £25\n\nPreparing for Patients B (year 2) – one week of College accommodation, approximately £130\n\nPreparing for Patients D (year 3) – travel costs, approximately £25\n\nClinical placements – years 4 to 6\n\nClinical placements start from year 4 of your course and will vary from student to student. You will be on placement at hospitals across the East Anglia Region.\n\nThe types of cost you will be expected to cover and those covered by the School of Clinical Medicine are detailed below.\n\nThe School will pay the cost of one return journey for each clinical placement.\n\nCosts of accommodation near the clinical placement hospitals are covered by the School.\n\nYou are expected to cover basic subsistence costs during your placements.\n\nOptional study abroad – year 5\n\nIn year 5 there is an opportunity to go abroad for 7 weeks. If you do, the estimated cost is around £3,000. College and national grants may be available to help you cover these costs.\n\nCourse funding\n\nYou may be able to get funding from the NHS to help pay for your studies. Find out more about the NHS Bursary.\n\nDisabled students\n\nThe University respects and adheres to the GMC's guidance on supporting disabled learners. You can view the guidance on the GMC's Welcomed and valued website.\n\nIn your first 3 years, your College and the Accessibility and Disability Resource Centre (ADRC) will arrange most of your support.\n\nDuring your clinical studies, the School of Clinical Medicine can arrange support. The School has a Student Academic Support Lead. They are a member of academic staff and they facilitate learning for disabled students.\n\nBecoming a doctor\n\nAs a graduate you’ll be able to get provisional registration with the General Medical Council (GMC). The GMC has certain expectations about attitudes, behaviour and performance of medical students.\n\nRead about registering as a doctor on the General Medical Council website.\n\nYou can then go anywhere in the country to complete two years as a junior doctor. These are known as Foundation Years. At the end of these two years you can register with the GMC as a doctor.\n\nRead about the foundation programme on the UK Foundation Programme website.\n\nIf you’re graduating from 2025 onwards, you’ll need to take the Medical Licensing Assessment (MLA).\n\nThis is a test introduced by the General Medical Council to test the core knowledge, skills and behaviours needed to practise safely in the UK.\n\nRead about the medical licensing assessment on the General Medical Council website.\n\nYour future career\n\nWe enable students to develop the excellent communication, clinical, interpersonal and professional skills required for good medical practice.\n\nAs a graduate you’ll be ready for a range of careers across:\n\ngeneral practice\n\nmedicine\n\npsychiatry\n\nother specialities\n\nIf you’re interested in an academic research career, our MB/PhD Programme leads to the MB, BChir and PhD degrees. Read about the MB/PhD on the School of Clinical Medicine website.\n\nTeaching\n\nThe first 3 years involve lectures, practical classes that include dissections, and small-group supervisions. There are typically 20 to 25 teaching hours each week.\n\nThe last 3 years focus on learning in clinical settings: at the patients’ bedside, in outpatient clinics and in GP doctor surgeries. Teaching is supported by seminars, tutorials and discussion groups.\n\nAssessment\n\nYour ongoing progress is reviewed each week and term by your College supervisors.\n\nFormal assessment, which determines your ability to proceed with the course, includes written and practical examinations, coursework submission and clinical assessments.\n\nPractical work is undertaken and assessed in all years of the degree programme.\n\nYou won't usually be able to resit any of your exams, except for professional qualifying exams.\n\nYear 1, 2 and 3 – pre-clinical studies\n\nYears 1 and 2\n\nThis is the pre-clinical part of the course where you study core medical science and clinical medicine.\n\nWe’ll provide you with the scientific basis that will allow you to develop your medical career to the full.\n\nThe main areas of learning are covered by courses in:\n\nFunctional Architecture of the Body, where you examine and dissect the human body, and includes living anatomy, and the use of modern imaging techniques\n\nHomeostasis, which covers the physiological systems that underpin the body's regulation of its internal environment and its responses to external threats. You also have related practical classes in experimental physiology and histology (the microscopic structure of tissues)\n\nMolecules in Medical Science, which examines the chemical and molecular basis of how cells and organisms work\n\nBiology of Disease, dealing with the nature and mechanisms of disease processes\n\nMechanisms of Drug Action, which provides an understanding of the basic mechanisms of drug action at the levels of both drug-receptor interactions and the effects on body systems\n\nNeurobiology and Human Behaviour, covering the structure and function of the sense organs and central nervous system, the effects of drugs on brain function, and various psychological aspects\n\nHuman Reproduction, where you look at the biology of the human reproductive system, its social context, and its influence on demographic trends\n\nHead and Neck Anatomy, where you learn about the structure and organisation of the human head and neck. There is a focus on the relationship of structure to function\n\nThe clinical strand of Years 1 and 2 involves:\n\nFoundations of Evidence-Based Practice, covering epidemiology and how it is applied in medicine\n\nSocial and Ethical Context of Health and Illness, which is an introduction to the broader cultural aspects of healthcare and the medical profession in Britain, working with patients and colleagues, both in hospital and in the community\n\nPreparing for Patients involves meeting patients in general practice in the first year, in a hospital setting in second year, and through visiting community-based health-related agencies in second and third year\n\nYear 3\n\nThis is the pre-clinical part of the course where you specialise in one of a wide range of other subjects. You might see this referred to as intercalation, to qualify for the BA degree.\n\nOptions include:\n\nYear 3 Biological and Biomedical Sciences subject in Natural Sciences\n\nYear 3 Natural Sciences subject\n\nA subject less related to Medicine, such as Anthropology, Management Studies, History of Medicine or Philosophy\n\nPreparing for Patients continues in your third year, regardless of the subject you choose to study.
