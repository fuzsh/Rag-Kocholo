        "text": "Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans, singer and actress Toyah Willcox, and TV doctor Punam Krishan are the latest contestants to be announced for Strictly Come Dancing 2024.\n\nAfter being unveiled by Vernon Kay on his BBC Radio 2 show on Tuesday morning, Evans, who for years has fronted the Go Compare television adverts, said he was most looking forward to taking on the ballroom numbers, but admitted to feeling “nervous” about the livelier dances.\n\nThe tenor told Kay: “Last night, even for this reveal and talking to you, I was so nervous. It was like the first day of school and I couldn’t sleep.”\n\nEvans added: “The classic ballroom stuff is the one I’m looking forward to the most because, obviously, for 20 years I was an opera singer so we did quite a lot of classic ballroom in opera.\n\n“The stuff I’m really nervous about is the stuff that needs any kind of jumping, because I think I represent every portly, middle-aged father who’s like, ‘I don’t want to really do the jive and set a minor tsunami off in North London’.”\n\nAfter Willcox was named moments later by Kay, she said staying in the contest long enough to reach Blackpool Week would be especially meaningful for her as her mother had danced in the seaside town when she was 18.\n\nShe also said she needed to “stop seeing myself as the Ann Widdecombe of dance and music”.\n\nIn addition to her lengthy career as a singer, Willcox has performed in numerous stage productions and featured in films, including 1978 drama Jubilee and 2019 sci-fi movie Invasion Planet Earth.\n\nDr Krishan is an NHS GP in addition to being the resident GP on BBC One show Morning Live.\n\nShe previously co-hosted a podcast titled The Medic Mum and authored the book, How To Be A Doctor And Other Life-Saving Jobs.\n\nThey join blind comedian Chris McCausland and JLS singer JB Gill, who were named on ITV’s This Morning on Monday.\n\nMcCausland is known for fronting his own ITV chat show, The Chris McCausland Show, as well as his frequent appearances on shows including Have I Got News For You and QI.\n\nSpeaking of performing on Strictly, he said: “If anybody out there is thinking, ‘How the hell is he going to do that?’ – then rest assured that I am thinking exactly the same thing.”\n\nGill found fame with boyband JLS, who were runners-up on The X Factor in 2008.\n\nHe has also had success as a farmer and presenter; he worked on CBeebies’ Bafta-nominated series Down on the Farm, and has contributed to Springwatch, Countryfile and Songs of Praise.\n\nGill said: “I danced in the Strictly Christmas special over a decade ago and loved it, so when I got the call to join Strictly this year, it was an immediate yes from me.”\n\nThe BBC dancing show has made headlines recently, after a storm of controversy over the alleged treatment of contestants.\n\nThe results of an investigation, launched by the BBC following allegations made about pro dancer Giovanni Pernice by former participant Amanda Abbington, have not yet been published by the corporation.\n\nPernice rejects the allegations and, along with fellow dancer Graziano Di Prima, has left the show."
