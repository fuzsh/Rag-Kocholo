        "text": "The Calvin M. Bower DMA Program at Notre Dame seeks to form 21st-century organists and choral directors with superior artistic and scholastic ability that is required of professional, collegiate, community, and church musicians who aspire to perform at the highest levels.\n\nWhy pursue a DMA at Notre Dame?\n\nStudent organists and conductors acquire a broad knowledge of Western sacred and concert repertories from performance and analytical viewpoints. As part of their core training, students also practice complementary skills that have become increasingly necessary in the professional world, such as conducting children's choruses and multi-disciplinary performance techniques. This program, housed in the College of Arts and Letters, draws world-class faculty from both the Music and Theology departments.\n\nAs part of the academic curriculum in Choral Conducting or Organ, students, together with the Director of Graduate Studies, will select courses that meet the requirements of the degree program and that support their individual professional goals. The program includes courses in liturgy and theology, ritual studies, early music and historical performance practices, music history, theory and analysis, and ethnomusicology, among others.\n\nConductors and organists have substantial opportunities for public performance, podium time, and interactions with professionals in the field. Sacred Music at Notre Dame hosts visits by some of the most salient choral composers, conductors, and ensembles of our time. These visits are frequently combined with master classes and private lessons.\n\nWhat can I do with a DMA?\n\nThe Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) is the degree needed to qualify for a wide range of leadership positions in academic music departments and in large churches and cathedrals. It is the terminal degree for performers, comparable to the Ph.D. for scholars. While a Ph.D. in music qualifies a person to teach academic courses in music history or theory, a DMA qualifies a person to perform music at the highest level, to teach performing musicians, and to manage performing ensembles and other programs. At the same time, this degree fosters high levels of critical inquiry: professionals holding DMA degrees often lecture or teach music history, theory, and other academic disciplines matching their creative interests.\n\nTypical positions that require a DMA in organ or conducting include:\n\nProfessor of Organ, University Organist, Director of Choral Activities, Professor of Conducting, or Professor of Church Music or of Sacred Music.\n\nSuch appointments may be made in a college or university Music Department, a university School of Music, a conservatory, a seminary, or a divinity school.\n\nDiocesan Music Director in a Roman Catholic diocese, or an equivalent position in another religious denomination.\n\nDirector of Music Ministry in a campus ministry, cathedral, or large parish.\n\nProfessional ensemble conductor or touring concert organist.\n\nMany organists and choral conductors with academic positions also fill part-time positions in a local parish.\n\nRecent graduates found positions at:"
