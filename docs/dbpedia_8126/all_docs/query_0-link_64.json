        "text": "A mural of former BBC newsreader Huw Edwards has been removed after he admitted having indecent images of children.\n\nThe artwork, unveiled in 2023, was part of a bigger mural in the presenter's home village of Llangennech, Carmarthenshire.\n\nArtist Steve Jenkins, 50, painted over the portrait on Tuesday after it was announced Edwards had been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children.\n\nCardiff council has also removed a plaque honouring Edwards at Cardiff Castle, and the BBC has removed from the iPlayer a Doctor Who episode featuring him.\n\nMr Jenkins, from Llanelli, had been proud to paint Edwards's picture.\n\nHe said: \"I feel deeply saddened to have to remove it as the whole village loved it when it was first done.\n\n\"I was given the topic of the village to base the mural on and we thought it would be nice if Huw was included.\"\n\nThe mural was in an underpass and Edwards had been to see it.\n\n\"It was lovely, he brought his mum along to see it and that's why this is such a bitter pill to swallow,\" Mr Jenkins said.\n\nThe BBC has removed an episode of Doctor Who from iPlayer which featured Edwards as himself in Series 2 episode Fear Her, broadcast in 2006 as part of David Tennant's debut series.\n\nVisitors to Cardiff Castle will no longer have access to an audio guide narrated by Edwards, or see a plaque in his honour previously erected there.\n\nCardiff council said: \"The plaque on the Cardiff Castle interpretation centre has been removed and the audio guide discontinued.\"\n\nEdwards admitted having 41 indecent images of children, sent to him by a convicted paedophile on WhatsApp at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.\n\nLlanelli councillor Gary Jones said: \"The mural had been previously defaced, on hearing the latest news the graffiti artist decided to paint over the image.\n\n\"The community council have already removed the photograph of Huw Edwards that hung in our community centre.\"\n\nEdwards' is involved with a number of different organisations in Wales.\n\nHis membership of the Gorsedd of the Bards will be discussed at the Eisteddfod in Pontypridd on Tuesday.\n\nRecorder of the Gorsedd, Christine James, said: \"The Gorsedd does not have a process or a specific mechanism to expel members.\"\n\nThe National Churches Trust said Huw Edwards was no longer vice president for the charity.\n\nThe Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, where Edwards is an honorary fellow, said it was not able to comment.\n\nCardiff University said it was \"reviewing procedures\" in relation to Edward's honorary fellowship and position as an honorary professor.\n\nSwansea University said it had no comment on Edwards' honorary fellowship.\n\nS4C said it had not commissioned any content involving Edwards since he left the BBC.\n\nThe oldest Welsh chapel in London, Capel Jewin, confirmed Edwards was a member but said he had not been seen for \"some time\".\n\nSecretary Llinos Roberts she said: \"No-one can comment because we don't know anything about it.\"\n\nLlanelli Mind, where Edwards was a patron, said it ended its relationship with him in May.\n\nThe University of Wales, Bangor University, University of Wales Trinity St Davidâs and the London Welsh Centre have all been approached for comment."
