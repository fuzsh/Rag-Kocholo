        "text": "CGU operates on a priority deadline cycle. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit complete applications by the priority dates in order to assure maximum consideration for both admission and fellowships.\n\nOnce the priority deadlines have passed, the University will continue to review applications for qualified candidates on a competitive, space-available basis. The final deadlines listed are the last date the University can accept an application in order to allow sufficient time to complete the admissions, financial aid, and other enrollment processes.\n\nApplicants must submit a sealed, official transcript from every undergraduate and graduate institution that has granted the applicant a degree. Electronic transcripts sent to admissions@cgu.edu are also accepted. For undergraduate coursework, applicants are required to submit proof of a completed bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited college or university. Unofficial copies of transcripts are accepted for review purposes, but official copies will be required upon admission.\n\nApplicants currently earning a degree that will be completed prior to attending CGU are required to submit a transcript showing work in progress for evaluation purposes. Once the degree has been granted, a final official transcript documenting the degree conferred must be submitted to CGU.\n\nInternational applicants are advised to review the International Transcript Guidelines for additional information on submitting international transcripts.\n\nWhen filling out the online application, please enter references acquainted with your potential for success who will submit a written recommendation on your behalf. In most academic departments, references from faculty members who can speak to your academic ability are preferred; applicants with substantial work experience may request professional references. Please do not enter family members as references.\n\nYou will be required to input information for your recommenders (whether they are submitting online or not) in the “Recommendations” section of the online application. Please follow the directions in this section carefully before clicking on “Recommendation Provider List” to input the names and contact information for each recommender. You will have an opportunity to indicate if the reference writer will be submitting online. These reference writers will receive an email from CGU with instructions on submitting an online recommendation.\n\nRecommenders who are indicated as offline will not receive an email from CGU with instructions to submit. These reference writers can submit via traditional mail and should use the supplemental New Student Recommendation Form. Recommenders can also email their letter of recommendation to the Office of Admissions at admissions@cgu.edu.\n\nDownload the Recommendation Form\n\nApplicants to degree programs in performance must audition as part of their application process.\n\nAuditions are not scheduled or considered until an application has been received by the Office of Admission and Records. You will be contacted to schedule your audition by a Music faculty or staff member.\n\nIf you are outside the Southern California area please refer to the section at the bottom of this page.\n\nPlease note: the requirements for degree programs at CGU are beyond those of the usual music conservatory. Upon completion of our doctoral performance degrees, students must be equipped with an in-depth knowledge of music theory and history, as well as the ability to read two languages other than English. Those languages may include German, French, Italian, or Latin. Spanish may be approved upon request.\n\nAudition Requirements\n\nFor instrumental performance programs (MA, DMA):\n\nInclude works representing three musical periods.\n\nFor vocal performance programs (MA, DMA):\n\nDMA: Minimum of a song or aria in each of the following four languages: English, German, French, and Italian.\n\nMA: Minimum of a song or an aria from three of the following languages: English, German, French, Italian, or Spanish.\n\nFor composition programs (MA, DMA):\n\nSubmit a large composition or several smaller works.\n\nFor conducting programs (MA, DMA):\n\nThe Music Department will contact you to schedule an audition. Upon request, conducting majors must also submit audition materials in viewable form.\n\nFor musicology programs (MA, PhD):\n\nSubmit an appropriate research paper of no fewer than 10 pages.\n\nApplicants outside of Southern California\n\nIf travel to CGU is difficult, you may submit a recorded audition rather than appearing in person. The Music Department accepts audition material in the form of CD or DVD. Distance applicants to the conducting program must submit audition material in viewable form (DVD only).\n\nWhere to Send Audition Materials\n\nYour audition material should be sent when you send your other application materials. Send audition materials clearly labeled with your name, the name of the program you are applying to, and the semester you are applying to enter to the following address:\n\nMusic Department (RE: audition materials)\n\nClaremont Graduate University\n\n925 N. Dartmouth\n\nClaremont, CA 91711"
