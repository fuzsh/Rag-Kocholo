        "text": "Tim McGraw (born May 1, 1967, Delhi, Louisiana, U.S.) is an American musician and actor whose melodic heartfelt songs and sandy Southern twang made him one of the most popular country music singers in the 1990s and early 21st century.\n\nRaised by a single mother, McGraw was 11 years old before he discovered that his father was famed professional baseball pitcher Tug McGraw. After dropping out of college in 1989 to move to Nashville, he found work as a club performer and signed a record contract with Curb Records in 1990. McGraw’s 1993 debut recording was unsuccessful, but his follow-up, Not a Moment Too Soon, became the biggest-selling country album of 1994 (and the sixth best-selling album of the year in any genre). His celebrity spread with the release of All I Want (1995) and with his high-profile marriage in 1996 to country star Faith Hill. By 2000 he was well-established enough to release a 15-song greatest hits package, and 2001 found McGraw and Hill accepting a Grammy Award for their duet “Let’s Make Love.”\n\nIn 2002 McGraw broke with Nashville convention by recording with his touring band, the Dancehall Doctors (most artists employed session musicians in the studio and road musicians in concert), and by releasing the controversial single “Red Ragtop”; a few country radio stations refused to play the song because its story line involved an abortion. In 2004 McGraw released the album Live Like You Were Dying. Its title song, penned by Nashville songwriters Craig Wiseman and Tim Nichols, was a tribute to McGraw’s father, who had died of brain cancer that January. That same year, in a rare collaboration between a contemporary country singer and a hip-hop artist, McGraw lent vocals to rapper Nelly’s song “Over and Over,” which became a mainstream hit. McGraw’s subsequent albums included Let It Go (2007), Southern Voice (2009), and Emotional Traffic (2012). Two Lanes of Freedom (2013) featured a duet with pop-country superstar Taylor Swift, whose debut single, “Tim McGraw” (2006), had memorably paid tribute to his music. His albums Sundown Heaven Town and Damn Country Music were released in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and in 2017 he and Hill released a collection of duets, The Rest of Our Life. His 15th studio album, Here on Earth, appeared in 2020."
