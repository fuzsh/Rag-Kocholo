        "text": "Description, General Components, Requirements: The program of study constitutes the formal requirements that must be met by the student before completion of work for the DMA degree. The program normally will comprise at least 60 credits beyond the master’s degree, and must be approved by the Graduate Professional Committee (GPC). Programs of study are developed by the student in close consultation with his or her program adviser, and are normally submitted to the GPC for approval by the third semester (or after 20 credit hours). Individual programs may vary considerably, depending upon the needs of the student (as revealed in the placement tests in theory and music history), general educational background, and career goals. The program of study must be approved by the GPC at least four months before the doctoral qualifying exam is taken. The DMA typically takes 3.5 years of full-time study to complete.\n\nApplied music: The DMA degree program emphasizes the study of applied music. All DMA students must be registered for one-hour lessons during the semester(s) in which they are preparing and/or performing a degree recital or lecture-recital. Students in the performance and literature major are required to take four consecutive semesters of applied music instruction.\n\nComprehensive examinations: Before completing the degree, all students in the DMA program must pass the comprehensive examinations, and must satisfy their various major departments and the GPC that they have attained broad competency as practitioners of music. The comprehensive examinations consist of a written examination in the fields of music history, literature, and theory, and an oral examination of a broad nature covering the student’s major and minor fields of study. A person submitting a full dissertation to satisfy the requirements of the degree will not be considered a candidate for the degree or permitted to begin work on the dissertation until she or he has passed the comprehensive examinations.\n\nStudents not writing a dissertation or doctoral essay will sit for the comprehensive examinations after all academic requirements of the degree and at least two of the performance requirements, plus the departmental jury, have been met.\n\nDissertation: Certain majors within the DMA degree program are required to complete a dissertation or final project, as indicated here by major. Ordinarily, the dissertation must be written in residence, under the supervision of the candidate’s adviser. A final oral examination (a defense of the dissertation) is not required of DMA candidates unless requested by the candidate, the department, the associate dean of graduate studies, or the adviser.\n\nEnsembles: All graduate students are encouraged to participate in the school’s large vocal and instrumental ensembles. No more than four credits may be earned through ensemble courses for degree credit without explicit permission from the GPC.\n\nForeign Language Requirements: Most majors in the DMA program do not have a foreign language requirement, except in those instances where the knowledge of a foreign language is essential to research or other work in a specific field. See the specific majors below.\n\nIndependent Study: Students may submit a proposal for independent study. This proposal must be approved by the adviser before it is approved by the associate dean of graduate studies.\n\nPerformance: Public demonstrations of proficiency in the field of applied music are required of all candidates for the DMA degree. Programs must be approved by the candidate’s major teacher (and, for conducting majors, by the faculty of the conducting and ensembles department) and his or her adviser. A faculty committee will be in attendance at each public program to assess if the performance reaches the level expected of doctoral candidates."
