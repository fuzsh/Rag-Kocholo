Voice Level

Voice Level Posters are customized per your instructions. Choose from several ways to visually portray voice levels.

Pledge

A pledge is an effective way to get everyone on the same page; and reinforce the foundation of your school’s culture.

Word Cloud

Ideal for schools that want to feature a different core value each month, and teach students the deeper meaning behind each term. If you don’t see a Word Cloud Poster for the word you want, just let us know. We’re glad to customize these for you.

First, make the student adapt themselves into the mascot’s community, with the phrase “I am a Bronco.” Secondly, associate the core value with being part of that group with “therefore I am.” The synonyms are used to expand their understanding of the core value. Each poster also features the mascot demonstrating the core value as an at-a-glance reminder of the concepts.

The Two Most Powerful Words in the World

There is a science behind stating an affirmation in such a way to get the best results - true transformation. People often start their affirmation with “I will,” or “I want” or “I can,” but none of those work as well as “I am,” and here’s why:

“I will” is just a promise to do something in the future. It has procrastination built into it. A lot of good intentions die a withering death waiting for the day you’ll finally get around to it.

“I want” is better because it appeals to the emotion of desire, which can be powerful, but in reality, a lot of wants go unfulfilled.

“I can” is empowering because it acknowledges your ability to accomplish something, but that just removed one roadblock. It doesn’t complete the journey.

Only “I am” transports you mentally to a point of completion, in the here and now. It’s a strong proclamation of ownership as opposed to a wishy-washy hope and a dream of something somewhere over the horizon, in a place not yet seen.

Calm Down

Calm Down posters give your students a quick, easy way to get their emotions under control with a simple exercise using their fingers. Each poster features your school mascot to make it more engaging and fully integrated with your school’s culture.

Emotions

Use these posters for SEL (Social Emotional Learning). Help children identify which emotion they are experiencing, and discuss the best ways to handle each emotion.

What Would

Teach better decision making. Each poster features various examples of your school mascot making good decisions. Talk about what students see in each illustration and how it translates into a good decision, a good result and ends up in a good time.

Super Powers

Read through the little factoids on this poster and imagine how kids will feel knowing they possess such amazing abilities: empowered, confident and capable. If you could teach a child one thing that would open up doors and opportunities for them in life, it would have to be a realization of their incredible ability to learn.

Which window covering is right for you?

Exterior Windows: Window Perfs allow insiders to look out while preventing outsiders from seeing in during daylight hours. At night Perfs do not prevent outsiders from seeing in if interior lights are on. Leave lights off at night.

Interior Windows: (office, classroom, library or cafeteria windows facing into a hallway or entryway): Choose from either solid vinyl or perforated window perfs. Solid vinyl blocks visibility in both directions. Perfs will only block visibility from a well lit space to a darkened space. To prevent visibility from a hallway or entryway (well lit) into an office or classroom, the lights would have to be turned off, and window blinds closed in the office or classroom.

Which window covering is right for you?

Exterior Windows: Window Perfs allow insiders to look out while preventing outsiders from seeing in during daylight hours. At night Perfs do not prevent outsiders from seeing in if interior lights are on. Leave lights off at night.

Interior Windows: (office, classroom, library or cafeteria windows facing into a hallway or entryway): Choose from either solid vinyl or perforated window perfs. Solid vinyl blocks visibility in both directions. Perfs will only block visibility from a well lit space to a darkened space. To prevent visibility from a hallway or entryway (well lit) into an office or classroom, the lights would have to be turned off, and window blinds closed in the office or classroom.
