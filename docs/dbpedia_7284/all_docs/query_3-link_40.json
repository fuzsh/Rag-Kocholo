An “outdoor classroom” presides over gorgeous, Maryland Green School grounds, often visited by the very butterflies that serve as the school’s mascot.\n\nWhether skipping stones at the nearby creek, conducting a science experiment, or painting according to artistic inspiration, Geneva students (and campers!) hold a lifelong love of learning in their hands. . .
