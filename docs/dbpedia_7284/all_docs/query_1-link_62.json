        "text": "History Instructor Rhonan Mokriski '90, has been named the 2024 Connecticut History Teacher of the Year by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. Established in 2004, this prestigious award recognizes exceptional elementary through high school teachers for their outstanding contributions to American history education.\n\nCongratulations to Mr. Mokriski on this well-deserved honor!\n\nWith our Knights now scattered across the globe, bringing the Sarum to their hometowns for the summer, and our faculty taking a well-deserved rest before diving into Professional Development retreats and trainings, the Hilltop is quite serene. Walking across the Quad, one hears echoes of the last week we were all together…What a week it was!\n\nToday we gathered in the Champions Lounge as nine more Knights signed their National Letters of Intent and Commitment! See details below.\n\nCongratulations, boys! It's a great day to be a Knight!\n\nEnjoy photos of the afternoon here.\n\nFriday, April 26th, was a picture-perfect day on the Hilltop! Gorgeous weather welcomed a smiling crowd of Trustees, Faculty and Staff, The Salisbury Golf Team, and Friends of the School to the Golf Range, as we dedicated it to Salisbury’s 7th Headmaster; Mr. Chisholm S. Chandler ’11 (Hon.) P’17,’25.\n\nWhile the GivePower Trek concluded December 2023, the Salisbury boys and faculty members who participated know and are reminded daily that their positive impact is lasting. During a short week, they made an immediate difference in the lives of a village in Colombia. The solar system they installed in Hondible will provide essential clean power for decades to come, unlocking new opportunities for the community."
