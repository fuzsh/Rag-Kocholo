        "text": "This first appeared in my college’s newspaper in 2011. In honor of my senior year, which starts on Monday, I’m posting it on the internet for the first time. It’s about our mascot, so it’s particularly relevant to those from my school, Geneva College. Still, I think a general audience will appreciate it, as long as they know that our mascot looks like this:\n\nWhat does the word “mascot” bring to mind? Perhaps you think of the Old Spice Man or that one bunny who never gets his breakfast cereal. Maybe you just think of a bed used for Roman Catholic liturgy. But here at Geneva, our hearts have been captured by one anthropomorphic atmospheric event : Turbo the Golden Tornado.\n\nTurbo hasn’t always been at Geneva, however. His life is as turbulent as he is, though perhaps a bit less twisted."
