        "text": "This is our son’s first year at Faith Christian (freshman). He was previously homeschooled. The transition has been absolutely wonderful! Thanking the good Lord that he is surrounded by such wonderful kids and staff. He told me the staff and teachers make him feel important and not just like a number. Sports has been great so far for him. His soccer coach really cared deeply about the boys and encouraged them to put God first in everything. Feeling so grateful to have this school as an option for our son!! – P Reynolds\n\nGrowing up I attended Faith K-8th grade and look back on all that I learned with gratitude for the foundation I was given through both the education and biblical view that was laid out in every aspect of learning. I now have three kids enrolled at Faith after a few years of public school and a couple of years of homeschooling. They are all thriving and growing so much in their education, but more importantly in their spiritual lives as they navigate the world around them today. The teachers and staff are so aware of each child’s needs and work together with us as the parents to help them grow and guide them in the same values we teach in our home. It’s a blessing and honor to have them in this school surrounded by adults that love them and want the best for them! – A Tabailloux"
