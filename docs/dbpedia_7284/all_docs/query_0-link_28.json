        "text": "This is not broken down into individual city school systems for the purposes of convenience and because of the frequent changes over the years, with cities and counties consolidating without affecting the status of any schools within the system. Would you believe that Vienna was once its own separate system? It combined with Dooly County in 1951.\n\nThis is also a bit of an historical attempt, to try to have some sort of history of schools, regardless of whether or not they have played in a state tournament. It is not going to be very detailed and for the most part will just be a modified version of the former past and present nicknames page. The dates of the schools are as accurate as currently possible. A few may be off by a year and it's possible I have misinterpreted a consoldation and name change somewhere. Hopefully, I haven't.\n\nLIME GREEN - Never had a full high school, but went to state as a Class D team.\n\nSKYBLUE - Extinct high school\n\nGOLD - Extant high school\n\nAny school without a link failed or has failed to make a state appearance."
