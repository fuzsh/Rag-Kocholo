        "text": "<p>Good morning,</p>\n\n<p>I actually stumbled across this thread when I googled HWS dorms. I am currently planning my wedding to another HWS alum and we are going to name our tables at the wedding after the dorms! Just wanted to share with you a few personal thoughts after reading the postings. My fiance & I both graduated from HWS in 2005. I went to Phillips Exeter Academy which is considered one of the top prep schools in the country so I assure you HWS is not filled with “borderline” prep schools. In fact, HWS is moving up in the rankings every year. My fiance came from public school. We both had one fo the best experiences we could have hoped for. First, Mark Gearan is the President of HWS, he was also the head of the Peace Corp under Bill Clinton. He is a genius and has more connections than most…therefore we were constantly able to attend guest lectures held by senators, foreign diplomats, Fortune 500 CEO’s etc. etc. He also teaches political sciences classes when possible usually around election time. I was lucky enough to have him as a professor and he is wonderful as are so many of the professors who really take the time to get to know you (It is not uncommon to go to a professors for dinner, office hours etc). HWS has opened so many doors since we graduated. I currently work for AIG (I know not so great right now but in 2005 when I graduated it was quite tough to get a job here and Exeter & HWS definitely helped, one of the people I interviewed with was actually a Hobart grad who also had an amazing experience). My fiance is a bond analyst at a top ratings corporation and currently goes to NYU Stern business school. I’m sure listing HWS on his application helped. Hobart & William Smith does open doors.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Some people inquired about the dooms. You are entitled to BOTH options of single sex or co-ed life. The female dorms are at the top of the hill (Small campus you can walk EVERYWHERE) the guys dorms are in the quad and then there is a SUPERDORM called JPR that is completely co-ed. Also, junior & senior year you have the option of living in theme houses which can also be co-ed.\n\nHonestly, I’m sure there are people who didn’t have the best experience here but I doubt it is higher than at any other college. The people I met there I’m still in contact with (many are coming to our wedding) and because of the small size of the college in general you really get to know a lot of people, class sizes are a lot smaller (better for class discussions & one on one with professors etc.), and you can’t beat the beauty of the campus. It’s also not too small though that you feel you know everyone within weeks. My parents really wanted to me to go Lehigh like many others in my family did but after my overnight trip to HWS I insisted on attending, my parents have realized this truly was the best decision and have never once believed since I went to HWS that I was getting a lesser education than Lehigh (tier 1 ranked). My fiance’s brother just accepted to HWS and we couldn’t be happier because we know he is looking forward to the amazing experience we both had.\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Good luck to you all in choosing!</p>\n\n<p>Lacrosse1,</p>\n\n<p>HWS has an excellent architecture program, one of the best on campus. Two friends of mine were in the architecture program. One continued on to the Washington Univeristy at St Louis and the other is at the Univerisity of Oregon. Others went to Syracuse for grad school. I took several classes in the Art department, and they were all taught by great professors. Ted Aub, Nick Ruth, and Stanley Mathews were some of the professors I had. </p>\n\n<p>Several of my friends from William Smith played lacrosse and field hockey; both have good standings in the league. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some of my experiences at HWS. </p>\n\n<p>I graduated several years ago from HWS. I am currently in medical school. During my brief spare time, I found this site while googling Hobart college and wanted to give a voice. I would like to say a few things about my experiences at HWS. Hopefully you get a chance to see the Houghton House art building which is off from the main campus, Another beautiful asset to the colleges in addition to the lake. </p>\n\n<p>First off, my times at HWS were some of the best years of my life. The liberal arts education is phenomenal. Notable speakers from all over the world come to the colleges through the Forum Speaker program. President Clinton spoke at at the colleges is one example. Mark Gearan is most likely the best college president out there, liked by all the students and professors, and very engaged with students. He is a former president of the Peace Corps and has lots of political connections to bring speakers to the campus. He is also instrumental in the future direction HWS colleges is taking. HWS always offered a great education, yet the infrastructure and opportunities at the school has improved in the past ten years during his leadership. This is making the colleges more desireable and well known. HWS is increasingly attracting more students. More people are realizing what the colleges offer. This adds to diversity of the applicant pool and the student body.\n\nHWS college is a gem. It is a unique school with the coordinate system, allowing for two Student governments, which I myself being involved in political campus clubs, found to make meetings fun and interesting. You should visit when school is in session if you are interested. </p>\n\n<p>The city of Geneva offers several good restaurants and some bars. You can always drive down the lake to the vineyards to eat at one of the restaurants nearby. I forget the name, but it was a very good place to for dinner a ways down the lake;always a waiting line. There is a great place downtown to get pizza and ranch dressing on the weekends. The Smith Opera House, on the national historic registrars list, plays host to big concerts that HWS sponsors each year. The Hockey rink is downtown and seems to always draw a rowdy crowd. There are clothing outlets about fifteen minutes away on the highway. You can take sailing classes at HWS if you want to sail on the lake. You can swim in the Seneca Lake in the fall. The Seneca Lake borders HWS’s campus. HWS is in the finger lakes wine county and is surrounded by much natural beauty. Cornell’s Agricultural field station is in Geneva. In short, Geneva is a decent college town with a gorgeous lake. You can run/walk from downtown to paths along the lake. From what I heard, a new waterfront dock may be in the works in the future. Yet, I found myself not really needing to venture off campus because I was always busy with school and activities on campus. </p>\n\n<p>I lived on campus all four years, and the school provides lots to do. I was never bored at HWS. I was studying a lot. To get A’s at HWS you will need to study and work hard. Yet, you will want to become active in your classes because the majority of the professors are very stimulating and engaging. Professors truly care that the student is interested. Students also show up to classes. Classes at HWS will make you want to learn; they did for me. Also, Hobart is not a suitcase school. Everybody lives near campus or on campus. You should check the colleges website to see the clubs and sporting events. HWS also has good athletic teams; fun to watch and they have a cool mascot named BART. Again, I suggest you visit the colleges website or call Admissions to learn more about the school if you have questions; maybe visit the school again. I visited twice; once for an interview and another time just passing though while looking at other colleges. When I visited the college for the second time, the beauty of the campus set it apart from others and I made my choice. </p>\n\n<p>HWS reputation for academics has always been strong. And the students I met were more friendly compared to other liberal arts schools I visited. This is why I chose HWS. Somehow on this message board, someone stated that it is a party school for rich kids, and it keeps getting passed through the forum. I would disagree. More than 76% of students receive some form of financial aid. I received financial aid and some scholarship. In 2004 HWS had a Rhodes Scholar. There are some very bright and hardworking students at HWS. I had friends who chose Hobart and William Smith over Cornell, Georgetown, Boston College, Trinity, Colby, and Dartmouth, just to name a few. I had friends who were bookworms and others that partied more than others. HWS has a variety of students. Some students may party more than others, yet this is at any school. Most of the harder partying was done by a certain few. You could find a party if you wanted to socialize. You could also socialize with people who did not drink. A Substance Free House exists on campus. Yet, there are also fraternities, while their presence is not dominating the school. For me, HWS offered a perfect balance of excellent academics and social down time on a picturesque campus. It also is very active in community service, with President Gearan leading the Colleges each Fall in the Day of Service, in which a large percentage of HWS students go into the Geneva area to volunteer their time. All four years at HWS, I did the Day of Service. I also was active in Habitat for Humanity. </p>\n\n<p>HWS is quickly attracting more applicants that are thrilled at the opportunities offered at HWS. The leadership of President Gearan has led to HWS becoming even more desirable. I foresee this to only increase in the future. Good luck with your college search.</p>"
