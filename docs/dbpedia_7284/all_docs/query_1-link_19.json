        "text": "CARROLLTON, GA – After over a decade as the Golden Knights, West Georgia Technical College (WGTC) is proud to announce its brand-new mascot, Knightro the Knighthawk.\n\nThe decision to create a new mascot was driven by a desire to have a unifying symbol that resonates with students, faculty, staff, and alumni alike. A mascot committee, made up of WGTC faculty and staff and led by WGTC’s marketing and communications department, chose the nighthawk to represent the College because it embodies many of the characteristics of WGTC students: adaptable, diligent, resourceful, and determined.\n\n“We are thrilled to announce Knightro as the official ambassador of West Georgia Tech,” said Amy Dollar, Director of Marketing & Communications. “Our goal in creating a new mascot was to add a strong and recognizable brand that our community, both within our walls and outside, could be proud of.”\n\nThe new mascot was designed and developed by Lime Biscuit Creative, a Carrollton-based company with extensive experience in branding. The team at Lime Biscuit worked with WGTC’s mascot committee to create a unique design that represents the College and symbolizes the hard work and resilience of the students, faculty, and staff.\n\nKnightro was revealed to faculty and staff in December and to students during “Weeks of Welcome,” an event that welcomes new and returning students to campus each semester. A full mascot uniform is in production and will be introduced to the public later this year. WGTC plans to integrate the mascot into various campus and community events.\n\n“Our mascot serves as a rallying point, a source of inspiration, and a reminder of the shared journey we’re all on as part of the WGTC community,” WGTC President Dr. Julie Post said. “Knightro is a celebration of our collective achievements, traditions, and the diverse experiences that make our college unique. It is my hope that Knightro will foster pride and connection among students and staff for years to come.”"
