The objective of Campus Ministry is to provide opportunities for self-reflection and to encourage growth in relationships with God and others. All members of our community, regardless of faith tradition, are invited to participate in the spiritual life of the school. Our Catholic ministry recognizes and honors the diversity that exists in our faith community. This flows from our grounding in the Catholic tradition inspired by the charism and spirituality of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.\n\nWhen you give to Notre Dame High School, you partner with us in educating hearts and minds. Your generosity is an investment in our institution that bolsters the future growth and success of our students, faculty, and staff. Together, we ARE Notre Dame."
