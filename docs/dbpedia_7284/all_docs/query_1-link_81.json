You get to review, revise and approved everything before it is printed to ensure you get exactly what you want.\n\nExplore all tabs on this page to see the many ways you can use your Knight mascot to create a more inclusive and engaging school culture.\n\nKnight Logos\n\nThese logos are customized with your school name and colors. These logos are used on posters, banners, signs and other products in our Roll Out Kits.\n\nKnight Graphics\n\nFor older students, these logos are customized with your school name and colors. These logos are used on posters, banners, signs and other products in our Roll Out Kits.\n\nDesign Options\n\nShowcase\n\nDownload a PDF version by clicking the three dots in the window below.\n\nPosters\n\nRules\n\nMatrix\n\nWe bring your Matrix to life with illustrations of your mascot demonstrating positive behavior. Every matrix is customized with YOUR words, YOUR colors and YOUR mascot/logo.\n\nDownload free editable templates at the bottom of this page.\n\nWelcome\n\nOur very popular welcome posters set the stage – telling students what it means to be part of your school’s community, and how to make good decisions.\n\nOur welcome message refers to rules/expectations and tells students how to make good decisions.\n\nOur simple welcome poster design is a great addition to any entry.\n\nOur \"Inclusive\" Welcome Banner features languages from around the world.\n\nTheme\n\nTheme posters are customized for you with anything you want: Your words, your colors, your logo, your mascot... We're glad to work with your logo/mascot or you can use one of ours. We have more than 175 kid-friendly mascots and a wide array of edgy/graphic logos suitable for older students.\n\nVoice Level\n\nVoice Level Posters are customized per your instructions. Choose from several ways to visually portray voice levels.\n\nPledge\n\nA pledge is an effective way to get everyone on the same page; and reinforce the foundation of your school’s culture.\n\nWord Cloud\n\nIdeal for schools that want to feature a different core value each month, and teach students the deeper meaning behind each term. If you don’t see a Word Cloud Poster for the word you want, just let us know. We’re glad to customize these for you.\n\nFirst, make the student adapt themselves into the mascot’s community, with the phrase “I am a Bronco.” Secondly, associate the core value with being part of that group with “therefore I am.” The synonyms are used to expand their understanding of the core value. Each poster also features the mascot demonstrating the core value as an at-a-glance reminder of the concepts.\n\nThe Two Most Powerful Words in the World\n\nThere is a science behind stating an affirmation in such a way to get the best results - true transformation. People often start their affirmation with “I will,” or “I want” or “I can,” but none of those work as well as “I am,” and here’s why:\n\n“I will” is just a promise to do something in the future. It has procrastination built into it. A lot of good intentions die a withering death waiting for the day you’ll finally get around to it.\n\n“I want” is better because it appeals to the emotion of desire, which can be powerful, but in reality, a lot of wants go unfulfilled.\n\n“I can” is empowering because it acknowledges your ability to accomplish something, but that just removed one roadblock. It doesn’t complete the journey.\n\nOnly “I am” transports you mentally to a point of completion, in the here and now. It’s a strong proclamation of ownership as opposed to a wishy-washy hope and a dream of something somewhere over the horizon, in a place not yet seen.\n\nCalm Down\n\nCalm Down posters give your students a quick, easy way to get their emotions under control with a simple exercise using their fingers. Each poster features your school mascot to make it more engaging and fully integrated with your school’s culture.\n\nEmotions\n\nUse these posters for SEL (Social Emotional Learning). Help children identify which emotion they are experiencing, and discuss the best ways to handle each emotion.\n\nWhat Would\n\nTeach better decision making. Each poster features various examples of your school mascot making good decisions. Talk about what students see in each illustration and how it translates into a good decision, a good result and ends up in a good time.\n\nSuper Powers\n\nRead through the little factoids on this poster and imagine how kids will feel knowing they possess such amazing abilities: empowered, confident and capable. If you could teach a child one thing that would open up doors and opportunities for them in life, it would have to be a realization of their incredible ability to learn.\n\nWash Your Hands\n\nWash Your Hands posters, plaquettes and stickers are perfect for your school's restrooms. Available featuring YOUR mascot.\n\nPosters are available in 24\"x 16\" or 36\" x 24\" sizes.\n\nPlaquettes are 12\" x 10\" printed on plastic board and sold in sets of 10.\n\nWall stickers are available in three sizes: 6\", 9\", 12\" and 18\"oval.\n\nClean & Healthy\n\nClean & Healthy posters teach students how to fight germs by using your school mascot as a positive role model. These posters can be customized with your school colors and logo; and if you'd rather use illustrations of childen, or teenagers, we are glad to accommodate.\n\nSay No to Drugs\n\nAnti-Bullying\n\nUse your mascot to set the tone and establish a school culture that does not tolerate bullying.
