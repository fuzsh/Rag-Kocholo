        "text": "Another Capital Region school district is set to change its mascot, following a statewide mandate from the Board of Regents.\n\nAverill Park Central School District's Board of Education is voting Monday to approve the name change from Warriors to Golden Knights, after the latter received the most votes through a student-led Warrior Renaming Committee effort and survey.\n\nVisually though, school officials said the change would take some time. The Golden Knights change is expected to go into effect for the 2025-26 school year, with the 2024-25 academic year to be used for developing a new logo and mascot.\n\nAverill Park is the latest school to adopt such changes, after the New York State Board of Regents voted last spring to mandate the retirement of Native American-themed logos, mascots and names, unless schools had approval otherwise from a recognized tribe. School districts must comply by 2025, or risk losing their state funding, impacting more than 50 districts across New York.\n\nSome districts in the Capital Region have already made the switch. Colonie, previously the Raiders, is now the Wolfpack; Corinth, previously the Tomahawks, is now the Riverhawks; Glens Falls, previously the Indians, is now the Black Bears; and Schoharie, previously the Indians, is now the Storm.\n\nBut other districts in the area continue to use the Warriors moniker, including Mohonasen, Niskayuna -- which has long gone without the Native American imagery, and opted for an \"N,\" similar to that used by the University of Nebraska -- and Stillwater. Lake George was formerly the Warriors, as well, but has since opted for the Lakers nickname.\n\nA spokesperson from Mohonasen Central School District sent CBS6 the following statement in response to an inquiry on the status of the name change:\n\nWe do not have an update for you. We are still in the discussion phase with the Board of Education. If and when a plan is set in place it will happen during the upcoming school year.\n\nIn 2023, Niskayuna Central School District Superintendent Carl Mummenthey wrote in an online update to the school community:\n\nAll of us at Niskayuna recognize the complexity of these actions and the wide range of emotions these actions will elicit from students, alumni, and families. At the same time, we also recognize the pain and harm that ongoing use of team names with Indigenous references can inflict on our students, our community, and the Indigenous peoples in our state and nation.\n\nThe rebrands will cost school districts, though, something stakeholders have urged the state to support through funding. According to the New York State Education Department, to assist. But this funding is not exhaustive to fill the gaps for districts."
