        "text": "Welcome to Ocoee High School!\n\n\\\n\nDear Knight Community,\n\nIt is with great pleasure and excitement that I introduce myself as a new member of Ocoee High School. My name is Dr. Frederick Ray, and I am honored to join this esteemed institution as a part of Knight Nation.\n\nI have a deep connection to this community, as I grew up in close proximity and am a proud product of the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) system. I was fortunate enough to secure a full scholarship in academics and football, which allowed me to attend Howard University. Upon my return, I played Arena Football for six years while working in OCPS during the off-season. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the field of education and reinforced my passion for giving back to the community that has supported me throughout my life.\n\nIn pursuit of my commitment to educational leadership, I earned a Master's degree in Educational Leadership and a Doctorate in Curriculum and Instruction. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working at all education levels, but I have spent the majority of my time in secondary education.\n\nI am truly inspired by the outstanding culture and high achievement at Ocoee High School. The dedication of the students, staff, and community members is evident, and I am eager to contribute to this institution's continued success.\n\nAs a member of Knight Nation, I am committed to upholding the values and spirit that define us. Knights never give up, and I am determined to embody this ethos in all that I do. Together, we will strive for excellence and create an inclusive and supportive environment where every student can thrive.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity before us and look forward to an incredible journey as we work together to continue to build our community.\n\nWith Knightly spirit,\n\nDr. Frederick Ray"
