        "text": "The Geneva City School District has introduced a new official logo that pays homage to the community’s affection for the shorthand Georgia G. Created with the assistance of Geneva-based In House Graphic Design, Inc., and incorporating input from a community survey and district employees, the new red and black “Geneva G” logo will represent the district and its four schools.\n\nAlong with the main logo, the Office of Athletics has also revealed a unique Panther mascot logo in response to student enthusiasm for the beloved Geneva Panther.\n\nAdditionally, the district has adopted a new tagline: “Imagine • Believe • Achieve,” emphasizing a blend of academic focus and inspiration for students.\n\nThe logos and tagline will be gradually implemented, with Superintendent Bo Wright expressing excitement about a logo that supports the district’s values and encourages pride in academics and the community.\n\nGet the latest headlines delivered to your inbox each morning.
