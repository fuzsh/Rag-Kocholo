The current principal is Mr. Gregory Baker, and the current assistant principal is Mr. Robert Smith.\n\nHistory[]\n\nRelatively little is known about the early history of Geneva public schools. On June 19, 1812, the New York State legislature passed an act for the establishment of Common Schools which became the basis of the common school system in the State of New York. The date of the first public school established in Geneva in compliance with this act was in 1815.[2] Subsequently, a number of schools were established in Geneva.\n\nIn 1853, the Geneva Union School was incorporated and authorized to maintain a classical department and to instruct a normal class. In 1863, Geneva schools were desegregated. On March 16, 1869, the Union School’s corporate title was changed to “The Geneva Classical and Union School.” It was the first Union School built in New York State[2].\n\nIn 1924-1925, a commodious High School building was built at the corner of Milton and Pulteney Streets in the City of Geneva. The school was erected on the grounds formerly occupied by a cemetery; the bodies from which were exhumed and removed to Glenwood Cemetery[2].\n\nIn 1981, the high school was moved to its present location at 101 Carter Road in the City of Geneva.\n\nFormer principals[]\n\nPrevious assignment and reason for departure denoted in parentheses\n\nMr. Issac Swift–1839-1852\n\nMr. J.E.
