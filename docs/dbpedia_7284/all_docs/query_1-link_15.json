        "text": "The Paladin was “knighted” as the mascot for Pinecrest Academy in a knighting ceremony led by co-founder, Mr. Bill Guilfoil in 2002. In 2018, our mascot was officially named Peter “The Rock” Paladin, named after Saint Peter, to whom Christ said, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church and the gates of the netherworld will not prevail against it.” (Matthew 16:18) Peter “The Rock” is affectionately known simply as “Rocky.”\n\nSo, why the Paladin? The Paladins have a distinguished history in the Catholic Church. They were knights who were defenders of the faith under the reign of Charlemagne.\n\nIn the year 800, Charlemagne traveled to Rome with an army to protect Pope Leo III. On Christmas day, he entered the Church of St. Peter for Mass. When he approached the altar and stooped in the act of prayer, the Pope placed a crown of gold upon his head. Immediately, the Roman people shouted, “Life and victory to Charles the August, crowned by God the great and pacific Emperor of the Romans.”\n\nBy this act, the Empire in the West was revived and, in theory at least, the world was declared by the Church subject to one temporal head, as Christ had made it subject to one spiritual head. It was understood that the first duty of the new emperor was to be the protector of the Roman Church and of Christendom against heathens. By his side in the endeavor were his illustrious knights called Peers or Paladins. They were residents of the palace and companions of the king. Their exploits as defenders of the Faith are legendary, and their names are engraved in the history of the Church.\n\nBill Guilfoil’s Words As He Knights The Paladin:\n\n“Great Paladin, Defender of the Faith, I knight you as the mascot of Pinecrest Academy. You were chosen as our mascot because you embody the qualities we cherish as a school; the qualities that are reflected in our crest. You always strive for improvement-- to be the best you can be. Our school motto, “Semper Altius,” Always Higher, is represented on the crest by a mountain with stars. The book and torch in the lower left hand corner of the crest represent your faith in the Word of God. The anvil in the crest’s upper right hand corner symbolizes your faithfulness in work and prayer. And finally, the armor, which you wear and which is shown on our crest, symbolizes courage and a fighting spirit. It is this great fighting spirit mighty Paladin, which earned you the title of Defender of the Faith! Because you have demonstrated your belief in these great virtues, we choose you as the Mascot of Pinecrest Academy.”"
