        "text": "Pegasus\n\nOur seal, Pegasus, dates back to 1968 when we were known as Florida Technological University. “Pegasus was the mythological winged horse of the muses. He carried their hopes, their inspirations and their poetry into the skies,” explained Dr. Millican, the university’s president at the time. Over the last 50+ years, Pegasus remains a symbol of our students reaching for the stars and achieving their dreams.\n\nKnightro\n\nKnightro debuted at the first Spirit Splash in 1994 as a knight in golden armor without a name. Over the next year, the golden mascot made appearances at events, sporting events and other student gatherings before being officially named Knightro. You’ll see Knightro — and maybe some of our other mascots — around campus, making appearances at athletics events, pep rallies and so much more.\n\nKnugget\n\n“It me.” The newest addition to athletics and campus events is a mini horse who goes by Knugget. This four-legged, fluffy and absolutely adorable member of Knight Nation hypes up students and spreads cheer everywhere. If you ever run into Knugget around campus, be sure to give him some well-deserved pets.\n\nClass Gifts\n\nThe annual class gift is a popular tradition among graduating Knights. It’s an opportunity for you to give back to your favorite area at UCF, from scholarships to a college or department to athletics and more.\n\nDid you know? Graduating students who make a class gift will receive graduation cords as a thank you. You’ll also be recognized during the commencement ceremony.\n\nMake a class gift\n\nReflecting Pond\n\nOur most recognizable landmark, the Reflecting Pond has a unique place in UCF history. It’s been around since the first year of classes and even served as a commencement ceremony location for several years. Today, it’s a great spot to relax in between classes and is hands-down one of the most popular backdrops for graduating Knights.\n\nMemory Mall\n\nOutdoor events. Tailgate activities. College GameDay backdrop. Memory Mall is packed throughout the year with students, alumni and visitors looking to enjoy some fun in the sun. As one of the focal points around campus, it’s quickly become an area for Knights to gather. You’d never guess that this open green space used to be a parking lot in our early years.\n\nLake Claire Recreation Area\n\nLooking for peaceful scenery? Take in all nature has to offer at the Lake Claire Recreation Area. Find a quiet spot by the lake or take a study break with friends. There’s lots to see and do, from kayaking and paddleboarding to sand volleyball and cookouts. Plus, you won’t want to miss out on the free events here each semester.\n\nSeal in the Student Union\n\nDon’t step on the seal! Legend says that you won’t graduate if you walk across the Pegasus seal in the Student Union. But once you have your diploma in hand? Go ahead and walk across it to celebrate your momentous achievement."
