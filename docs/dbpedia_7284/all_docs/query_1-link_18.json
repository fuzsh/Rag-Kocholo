        "text": "Dear Knights View Royal Families,\n\nHere is a little information about our school. Knights View Elementary School’s staff, students, and families are known as the Knights View Royals. Our school mascot is a Royal Dragon and our school colors are blue, green, and yellow.\n\nOur unique name, Knights View, represents our students’ present and future. Our school is located in South Charlotte, directly across the street from our feeder high school, Ardrey Kell. Ardrey Kell High School is the Home of the Knights. Every day, as our staff, students, and families arrive at KVES, we have a visible reminder of our students' future as we view the high school of the Ardrey Kell Knights. At KVES, we are committed to each and every child’s success. We want to ensure that students have the necessary character, leadership skills, and academic achievement to succeed in high school and beyond.\n\nAnd when the day comes, and our KVES students have grown into an Ardrey Kell Knight, we want them to look back across the street at our elementary school and have amazing memories of belonging and success. At KVES, we want our students to be the most amazing leaders of their behavior, their learning, and in the school and community today and tomorrow."
