District leaders have come up with a short list of possible new nicknames and mascots for what used to be Buford Middle School, as it reopens as the future Charlottesville Middle School. On the list… Black Knights, just like the high school’s nickname; a different kind of “Knights” nickname; Chargers, or Monarchs.\n\nThe school system’s inviting students, staff, families, and community members to participate in an online survey through April 30th. A committee of staff and students will review the results and recommend next steps."
