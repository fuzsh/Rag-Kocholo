        "text": "ACKLEY\n\nAckley-Geneva's Indian Raider mascot stays -- at least until the state says otherwise.\n\nThe Ackley-Geneva School Board earlier this week unanimously voted to keep the school's controversial mascot depicting a Native American wielding a tomahawk.\n\nSchool board officials say the mascot will stay unless the state bans human mascots, Native Americans protest the decision or the district merges with another.\n\nIowa doesn't prohibit human mascots, but Minnesota and Nebraska have banned the practice. Currently, the Iowa Department of Education discourages using human mascots.\n\n\"We haven't asked the Legislature (for a ban) yet, but it's possible,\" Thomas Anderson, education equity consultant for the Department of Education, previously told the Courier.\n\nThe idea to change here -- although kicked around for over 15 years -- was brought up in September when the AG and Wellsburg-Steamboat Rock districts discussed sharing varsity football programs. On Sept. 15, the board unanimously -- with the support of the student council -- decided to keep the mascot for only one more year.\n\nBut when there wasn't enough support from either school district last month to share football programs, the desire diminished to change the mascot.\n\nOverwhelming support from the community to keep the mascot, board members said, helped change their view.\n\n\"I haven't heard one negative word when it comes to the mascot, besides from Superintendent (Kirk) Nelson and a couple of teachers. In fact, the students have changed their minds and several people with a Native American heritage have said they're proud of it,\" board member Douglas Timmons said.\n\nA petition with more than 650 names supporting the Raider mascot was recognized by the board Monday before the vote and about 40 people showed up to keep the image, Timmons said. He was the one to present both motions to change and keep the Raider.\n\n\"Most of the citizens of Ackley didn't feel they were demeaning Native Americans, but honoring them. Our curriculum has always been pointed toward understanding diverse views and cultures -- we certainly don't allow students to use racist or negative terms or actions,\" said Leon Lindsay, board president.\n\nBut Superintendent Nelson, a longtime opponent of Native American mascots, was disappointed with the board's decision. He asked the board to table the vote until spring when an open forum could be held with students, citizens, local Native Americans and state and federal officials to discuss the topic.\n\nIt was denied.\n\n\"We want students to be independent thinkers and decide for themselves if using human mascots is offensive. It's just not my opinion, the Iowa Department of Education and other states also believe the way I do,\" Nelson said.\n\nSchool board members hope the mascot topic is behind them and they can put the controversy \"to bed and get on with more important issues.\"\n\nAnd those issues include a whole-grade sharing agreement with another district, namely Wellsburg-Steamboat Rock and a $4.7 million bond issue in March for building renovations and additions.\n\nIn 1995, the W-SR board voted down a merger, but board members here are still hopeful. The two districts currently share some athletic and academic programs,\n\n\"We want whole-grade sharing in the future and we didn't want negative aspects of this issue harming that,\" Timmons said.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
