Starting in elementary school the students make \"arts in crafts\" that mock native culture and make noises that are similar to war cries. Their marching band is called \"The Pride of the Tribe,\" a name that lacks any regard for Native Americans and their culture. In the school there's paintings of their \"mascot\" and their school symbol, an s with an arrow through it.\n\nThe dehumanization of Native Americans within the American education system has to stop. A people who have had their culture stripped and stolen from them should never be a mascot. This is only the tip of the iceberg of the racism that has permeated throughout the city, and it needs to stop now.\n\nContact information:\n\nSchool Phone Number: 334-886-2008\n\nPrincipal Email: b.t.hinson@genevacoboe.org\n\nGeneva County Board of Education Phone Number: 334-684-5690\n\nGeneva County Board of Education Superintendent Email: birdsongb@genevacoboe.org"
