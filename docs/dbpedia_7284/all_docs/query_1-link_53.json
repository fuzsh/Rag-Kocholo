        "text": "Champions play at UCF.\n\nKnights athletic teams have earned landmark victories on state and national stages — leading them to become the youngest Power 5 institution in the country. But some of our student-athletes’ most important triumphs have been in the classroom, where they’ve achieved an average GPA of 3.0 or higher for 31 consecutive semesters. As UCF begins its Big 12 era, it joins a league that has produced more than 800 Academic All-America selections and claimed national championship team titles in 20 of its 23 sponsored sports. Its student-athletes and teams have combined for 742 individual NCAA titles under the Big 12 banner.\n\nBeing a part of the action is an important part of the UCF experience — because we’re never as strong alone as we are together.
