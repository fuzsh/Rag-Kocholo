        "text": "History\n\nUnder former university president Abraham S. Fischler, Nova University began its athletic program in 1982. A contest, which was open to the general public, was held to come up with a nickname for the new athletic program at Nova University. The nickname \"Knights\" was chosen, after being deemed the most popular submission by contest participants.\n\nIn 1994, Nova University merged with Southeastern University of the Health Sciences and becomes Nova Southeastern University. After 23 years under the Knights mascot, NSU unveiled \"Sharks\" as the new nickname for the university and its athletic teams in 2005.\n\nRazor\n\nWhen Nova Southeastern switched its mascot to the Sharks in 2005, Razor was born. Razor can be seen at games, athletic events, and student activities across campus. Whether he is dancing at midcourt, riding his scooter, or motivating the crowd, Razor’s enthusiasm for Shark athletics is always on display. Nova Southeastern is proud to have Razor as its official mascot.\n\n\"Razor\" the Mako Shark Quick Facts\n\nName: Razor\n\nDate of Birth: 2005\n\nBirthplace: Atlantic Ocean\n\nEducation: Nova Southeastern University\n\nHeight: About 6 feet from snout to caudal fin\n\nWeight: Varies on fish intake\n\nFavorite Snack: anything from the SSC that gets in my way!\n\nFavorite Movie: Jaws (Dream big!)\n\nFavorite Song: Fins by Jimmy Buffet\n\nFavorite Car: The Sharkmobile\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
