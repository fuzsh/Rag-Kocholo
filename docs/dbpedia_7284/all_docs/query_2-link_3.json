        "text": "Private school in Casselberry, Florida, United States\n\nThe Geneva School is a private, classical, coeducational Christian day school, founded in 1993. The Geneva School is located on a 40-acre campus in Casselberry, FL. Geneva is accredited by the Florida Council of Independent Schools. The total enrollment for 2022-2023 is about 660 students, K4–12.\n\nGeneva employs a Christian classical education model. This trivium model of education consists of three distinct stages: grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric.\n\nGrammar (Grades K4–6) makes use of a student's innate curiosity, inquisitiveness, and ability to absorb the basic material of a subject. Students learn such fundamentals as arithmetic tables, scientific formulas, biblical narratives, Latin paradigms, and cultural histories from Mesopotamia to our own time.\n\nDialectic (Grades 7–8) uses a student's natural inclination to question and analyze. In this investigative stage of learning, students acquire the tools of logic and critical thought to build the framework to ask meaningful questions and pursue deeper truths.\n\nRhetoric (Grades 9–12) teaches students how to communicate the grammar and dialectic disciplines effectively. Their confidence in how to think for themselves is built up by developing a capacity to present their views through speech and through writing.\n\nThe Geneva School athletic teams are known as the Knights. The Knights are full members of FHSAA and compete at the 2A level in most sports. TGS also has an extensive youth sports program for grammar school students.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, The Geneva School upper school (7th–12th grade) moved into the new facility in Casselberry at the same location as the state-of-the-art outdoor athletic facility which opened in 2016. The new lower school (K4-6th grade) opened adjacent to the upper school in August of 2022, making it the largest dedicated private school campus in the Orlando metropolitan area.[1]"
