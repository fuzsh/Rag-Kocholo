        "text": "When Head of School Dr. Mike Davis asked the youngest audience members at Colorado Academy’s opening All-School Assembly on the first day of school what they were most looking forward to this year, the responses from Lower Schoolers were nearly unanimous: making new friends and having fun.\n\nColorado Academy’s new Assistant Head of School, Amy Wintermeyer, says there are three things that drew her to the newly-created role: the position itself, the place, and the people.\n\nFollowing a swift downpour at the 2024 All-School Picnic, rainbows appeared, and the beloved gathering had done what it always seems to: bring old friends and new acquaintances together to kick off the new school year at CA.\n\nAt their Continuation to Upper School, Eighth Graders gather with their families, teachers, classmates, and friends for a moment that’s marked by anticipation, hope, and wonder.\n\nCheers and applause greeted Colorado Academy Fifth Graders for their Continuation ceremony. The students have shined as young thinkers, creators, and doers ready for the next adventure of their lives.\n\nThe undefeated Mustangs Girls Soccer Team walked away with a 3-1 victory over Jefferson Academy to claim CA’s first State Title in five years.\n\nSome have used the word “dynasty” when describing Colorado Academy’s incredible recent dominance in CHSAA’s Class 5A Girls Lacrosse competition. The Mustangs’ Championship streak stretched to a ninth year, and their all-time Championship tally to 10, as they defeated the Fairview High School Knights by a score of 15-3 to win the 2024 State Title.\n\nThe Senior Team hoisted the coveted CA Giant Relay Day Cup, beating three other teams of alumni, faculty and staff, and parents on a day filled with sunshine, fun, and games for all ages. The Giant Relay, a CA tradition that can be traced back to the 1950s, once included a segment on horseback, but today sees competitors running, swimming, biking, and kayaking to determine a winner.\n\nThe annual All-School Arts Festival on Stamper Commons is one of Colorado Academy’s most beloved spring traditions—right up there next to Giant Relay Day and Commencement—and this year, participants were encouraged to slow down and take a moment to appreciate the unique connection between art and community that it always inspires.\n\nGuests at the 2024 CA Concert were treated to an acoustic solo performance by Colorado’s own Nathaniel Rateliff and Grammy-nominated Margo Price and her explosive band, who brought the energy and brought people to their feet.\n\nCA dance and theater instructor Melissa Zaremba’s Middle School students were ecstatic when she told them what piece they’d perform for their annual musical. A comedy that celebrates the wackiness in every family, The Addams Family feels particularly relevant for these kids right now.\n\nIn the inaugural winter edition of the CA vs. Kent Showdown Series on January 23, Colorado Academy Boys and Girls Basketball teams both defeated Kent at the University of Denver’s Richie Center, while Mustangs Ice Hockey came up one goal short versus the rival Sun Devils.\n\nIn CA’s Advanced Studies and Research (ASR) classes offered in the Upper School, a few things stand out: the many voices sharing ideas and observations, the willingness to question conventional wisdom, the fingers flipping (or laptop-scrolling) to relevant passages in primary and secondary sources, and the laughter—plenty of it.\n\nCA Honors English course Literature of Work asks students to explore the meaning of work through literature, personal reflection, class discussion, and a final project based on interviews with professionals in various fields, many of them CA alumni.\n\nCA's Lower School Choir recently performed alongside dozens of high school and college ensembles at the annual conference of the Colorado Music Educators Association at the Broadmoor. The Fourth and Fifth Grade singers were selected from across the state annually.\n\nFor more than 25 years, Colorado Academy’s Sixth Grade Core program has helped students feel safe, seen, and successful. An academic and social-emotional cushion that affords children a “soft landing” on their arrival in the Middle School, Core integrates language arts, social studies, and Advisory.\n\nFor more than a year, Colorado Academy Head of School Dr. Mike Davis has been speaking to students, faculty, families, and other education leaders—really, to anyone who will listen—about the need for schools to respond more urgently to the dramatic advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOutdoor October returned to the Lower School for its second year as an extension of Colorado Academy’s Experiential Education program. From studying rocks and minerals to understanding the forest’s lifecycle to playing interactive games about the food chain or gaining survival skills, Lower School students learn by doing.\n\nThe Mustangs brought all of their skill, bravery, and hunger for victory to the pitch as they claimed a second 3A Boys Soccer Championship trophy in a row with a 3–1 defeat of the Coal Ridge Titans. The win made it seven state titles in all for CA, and the third in four years.\n\n“They play for something larger than themselves,” is how Head Coach Veronica Scott explains the Colorado Academy Varsity Field Hockey team’s incredible two-year undefeated run, which came to a thrilling conclusion in their 1–0 Championship victory over Cherry Creek.\n\nLS Student Council offers a group of nine Third through Fifth Graders the opportunity to work closely with Principal Angie Crabtree to build connections across grades, inspire school spirit, serve as role models in their classrooms, and create school-wide change.\n\nThe Big Draw returned to Colorado Academy for a 13th year to inspire artists in Pre-K through Grade 12 during this annual all-school celebration of creativity. This year's focus was exploring the ways we personally process the world through our senses.\n\nTwo dozen Seniors from the Class of 2024 were chosen to join CA’s CA's Community Leadership Team, or CLT, from among more than 50 applicants for their approachability, trustworthiness, emotional intelligence, leadership qualities—and kindness.\n\nWhen he was in first or second grade, Nick Malick wanted to be the ice cream man; in high school, he thought he’d be a teacher; and later, in college, he studied philosophy and writing. But now, as Colorado Academy’s new Middle School Principal, Malick may have found the role that perfectly swirls these disparate flavors together.\n\nAn experienced competitor, basketball coach, teacher, and administrator, not to mention the parent of a CA student-athlete who graduated in the Class of 2022, Director of Athletics Jon Hill embraces the many roles he must play by zeroing in on the one truth that ties them all together: Athletics is about enabling people to be their best.\n\nThe foundation of Director of Safety and Security Miriah Medina's approach to safety on the CA campus: working with the school community to build a culture in which human care and connections, common-sense practices and policies, and the latest technologies combine to make it far less likely that bad things could ever happen here.\n\nAs the only Middle School course that is offered pass-fail, Critical Thinking encourages Seventh Graders to venture “outside the box,” taking risks and questioning their own ideas as they work through a series of challenges carefully constructed to hone key disciplines and skills, such as close reading, creativity, persuasive writing, public speaking, digital literacy, and multimedia design.\n\nWhat’s interesting about Climate Change, an advanced science course for Colorado Academy Eleventh and Twelfth Graders, is that it’s different every year, says Dr. Leo Procise, who shaped the Honors elective into its current form.\n\nThe demand for the expertise of the CA Music Department speaks to the scope and popularity of the CA music program, particularly at the Middle and Upper School levels, where students can find a way to pursue seemingly any musical path at CA, from mastering an instrument to exploring music theory.\n\nIf there is one word that can distill the essence of Colorado Academy’s Lower School Music Program, that word is joy. From Pre-K through Grade Five, CA’s music teachers make it their mission to ensure that every child, in one way or another, has access to the joy that is music."
