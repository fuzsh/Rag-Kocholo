        "text": "Scrabble: A Photo-text Haunted by a Traumatic, ‘Ghost’ Image\n\nAlthough Ferrier repeatedly criticised the tyrannical domination of the visual in contemporary societies, and remained for a long time reluctant to use actual images in his literary work, he eventually did so for the first time in Scrabble, his first photo-text. Focusing on his childhood memories in Chad until the age of twelve, when a civil war broke out in the country, this autobiographical récit contains dozens of illustrations ranging from photographic images (both private archives and pictures taken by famous artists such as Raymond Depardon and Malik Sidibé) to various maps, archival documents and drawings.\n\nThe illustrations in Scrabble have been carefully selected and arranged based on their visual and thematic content but also because of the part they play in the structure of the book and its narrative progression. The photos generate a sense of immediacy and familiarity with the author, which is compounded by an extensive use of the present tense in the story and its numerous descriptions, creating a certain proximity with the events related from the present of writing: e.g. ‘Je me revois dans la cour…’ (17); ‘Mais, pour l’instant, j’ai dix ans…’ (24); ‘j’entre dans le temps de l’enfance qui précisément ne connaît pas le temps’ (18),Footnote12 this example evoking a kind of extended, endless present that characterises childhood. Concurrently, photographic images representing Ferrier are treated in the text and in the captions from an external and distant perspective, the third person being used to refer to the child on the pictures: ‘L’enfant’ (‘The child,’ 26), ‘Le garçon’ (‘The boy,’ 225), the ‘il’ (‘he’) occasionally alternating with the first person (‘je’), e.g. on page 76: ‘“Non, Saleh. Je n’oublierai pas” Je n’ai pas oublié.’Footnote13\n\nThis oscillation in the book between distance and proximity, and between presence and absence as epitomised by the photographs, largely contributes to the ambiguity, to the mysterious dimension of the narrative which is introduced from the opening scene with the two brothers playing Scrabble. This scene is pervaded by the ominous tension of the war that is about to break out, and we understand that the children’s mother asked them to play this board game so as to stay as calm as possible in this frightening situation. It is as if time was put on pause, and the narrator’s childhood suddenly interrupted. Here is how he describes this primary, almost primal scene in the book:\n\nThis tense scene is characterised by its immobility; it reflects a state of sideration or medusa-like effect, as if everything was petrified. As clearly stated in the text, ‘Les enfants eux-mêmes ont l’air figés dans une pause faussement naturelle’ (12).Footnote15 The strangeness of the situation is reinforced by an ominous, deafening silence—the calm before the storm. To continue quoting from this opening scene, ‘Le silence est total maintenant. Un silence de mort’ (14).Footnote16 This explicit mention of death and of an imminent war was already announced by the earlier reference to a still-life image, which creates a memento mori effect, and by a repeated use of the semantic field of warfare.\n\nWhen considered all together, these various characteristics are very reminiscent of photographic images, Christian Metz for example claiming in this respect that ‘the powers of silence and immobility […] belong to and define all photography’ (83). In the same 1985 article entitled ‘Photography and Fetish,’ Metz adds that ‘Movement and plurality both imply time, as opposed to the timelessness of photography which is comparable to the timelessness of the unconscious and of memory’ (83). As we can see here, there is a congruence between the opening scene described by Ferrier in Scrabble and photography, which both combine silence, immobility and timelessness, and by extension, a reference to death, photography being defined by Metz (via Philippe Dubois in L’Acte photographique) as a ‘thanatography’ (83). According to Metz, “Photography is a cut inside the referent, it cuts off a piece of it, a fragment […], for a long immobile travel of no return. Dubois remarks that with each photograph, a tiny piece of time brutally and forever escapes its ordinary fate” (84). This remark perfectly matches the Scrabble scene, which is a decisive, traumatic moment stopped in time, with clear photographic features and a punctum-like dimension to borrow Roland Barthes’ expression. In other words, it is described as if it was a photograph, and in this respect it shares the spectrality of memory and of photography, between presence and absence, past and present, life and death. The suspended present evoked by Ferrier, haunted by terrifying memories and images, is in fact that of his own childhood (the age of innocence), brutally interrupted by war and forever put on hold. This is well emphasised by the last photo published in the book, taken by Depardon in Chad in 1980, and representing a child soldier (214). As Ferrier explains in the text, this inextricable overlap between childhood and war (and therefore violence), is his own, personal camera obscura, the dark chamber at the very origin of his work: ‘Mon cœur, mon cœur bat comme un tambour, une force obscurément me tire: je touche le fond obscur de ma mémoire, le secret même de l’écriture’ (217).Footnote17 Like Barthes’ ‘Photo du Jardin d’Hiver’ (Winter Garden photo) in La Chambre Claire (Camera Lucida, 1980), Marguerite Duras’ ‘photographie absolue’ (absolute photograph) in L’Amant (The Lover, 1984) and Hervé Guibert’s ‘image fantôme’ (ghost image) in his book bearing this title (1981), the most important photo in Ferrier’s Scrabble that would have shown him playing this board game with his brother is an absent photograph, one that was probably never taken—the most decisive events in our lives are indeed rarely recorded by cameras. In these four photobiographical works in which the authors strive to access some truth about their life story and identity via the framework of photography, the central image from which the entire text stems can only be described to the readers, its dazzling absence being further emphasized in Scrabble (and La Chambre Claire) by the numerous pictures that are actually reproduced. The decisive memories behind the absent photos carry much more than themselves and were not fixed forever only on the retina of the authors’ eyes, but in their entire body; if the photographic framework prevails here for its fixity and immobility corresponding well to a state of shock (a kind of memory flash, clearly separating a before and an after since nothing can ever be the same again after such events), the absent photo which is literally framing Scrabble from the Prélude to the Épilogue is much more than a mere (quasi-)photo, a still image: it is a kind of enhanced, multi-medial photo, the text revealing and activating all its potentialities in slow motion.\n\nAfter the opening scene of the book, which corresponds to its ‘Prélude’ (10–20), Scrabble unfolds over three acts or main parts: ‘Toumaï’ (21–68), ‘L’école du dehors’ (‘Outside school,’ 69–165) and ‘La guerre’ (‘War,’ 167–222), followed by a brief ‘Épilogue’ (215–222). Its structure follows a more or less chronological order from infancy to adolescence, and it comes full circle since the epilogue echoes the opening scene. The latter eventually becomes ‘lisible’ (‘legible,’ 219) and intelligible, as if this long dive into childhood memories functioned as a kind of revelatory bath. To quote the text once more: ‘Silence. […] Des enfants jouent. Autour, un pays s’effondre’ (218).Footnote18\n\nThis coming-of-age story is set for the most part in the capital city of Chad, N’Djamena, the narrative winding through its various streets and districts. In this respect, the maps reproduced in the book (16, 126) have a programmatic function since they figure the spatial progression and progressive emancipation of Toumaï, getting further and further away from his house until he ventures in the popular Bololo district in flames at the end of the story, in a dramatic scene. As Ferrier puts it, “Tous ces éléments épars, […] je peux désormais en concevoir l’ensemble, les réunir et les ajuster comme les pièces du Scrabble ou les voir se disposer l’un par rapport à l’autre sur la carte accrochée au mur du bureau, dans la caserne de mon père” (123).Footnote19 As we can see here, the Scrabble game itself functions as an operative metaphor in Ferrier’s book, which is constructed as an album combining black and white photos and texts. This invites readers/viewers to consider each scene and image in succession, or to follow the metaphor, to progress on the wooden board from one square to the next. In fact, the experience of reading this photo-text amounts to observing a Scrabble game unfolding in front of our eyes, with several key memories progressively revealing themselves via double and triple word scores such as ‘Toumaï,’ ‘N’Djaména,’ ‘Chari’ (the great Chadian river), or Amaboua, the friend to whom the book is dedicated. As Ferrier explains in the ‘Prélude,’ ‘tout ce qui va être conté maintenant, le sera à partir de cette puissance de l’enfance, de ces quelques pièces de bois disposées sur la table et d’une case centrale étoilée sur laquelle sera posé le premier mot joué’ (20).Footnote20\n\nThe word and image assemblage that ensues alternates long narrative passages with frequent ekphrasistic pauses and illustrations, effectively zooming in and out of the focus area, with occasional wide angles and double page spreads (e.g. 100–101 and 130–131). The rhythm of writing and reading is often fragmented, with sudden accelerations such as the final movement leading to the death of Ferrier’s childhood friend Youssouf, and the decision of his family to leave Chad and move back to France. It mirrors the way memory functions, which is reflected by several visual echoes and association of images (e.g. the photos of Ferrier and his father both carrying a monkey on their shoulders on pages 32 and 110, and of Ferrier and a young shepherd accompanied by dogs on pages 62 and 65). It also regularly expresses a multisensory pleasure combining image, music and text; this is for example what we observe when the narrator evokes his discovery of the multiple languages spoken in Chad when he was a child: ‘Les mots défilent comme des rêves devant mes énormes loupes. Je rêve d’un Scrabble plurilingue et polyphonique, où des bribes de latin et de grec se greffent à des fragments de gorane et de sar, de kanembou et de massa, de peul et de haoussa’ (151).Footnote21 Terms such as ‘cheptel,’ ‘transhumance’ (172), ‘kundu’ (a kind of balafon, 146) and of course ‘N’Djamena’ (123) are mentioned in the text as good examples of words and names that took up almost a magical, auratic dimension for the child that Ferrier was, crossing over linguistic, cultural and medial borders, and arousing his verbal, aural and visual curiosity."
