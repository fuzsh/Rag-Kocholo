        "text": "After finishing third in the 1979 Le Mans 24 Hours race, Laurent Ferrier and François Servanin decided to take on the challenge of starting a watch company. They wouldn't start working toward realizing this dream until 2009, when they eventually founded Laurent Ferrier SA. The Galet Classic Tourbillon Double Spiral was Laurent Ferrier's first model, and it was this that launched the watch brand in 2010. The young brand gained recognition when this watch won the title of \"Best Men's Watch\" at the esteemed Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève in November. The 2011 Galet Secret Double Hairspring Tourbillon, which has a hidden dial that opens at the touch of a button or according to a preset schedule, was their next major accomplishment"
