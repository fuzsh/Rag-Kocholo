        "text": "In a somewhat unexpected move, Laurent Ferrier introduces an alll-new sporty chic Tourbillon Grand Sport watch to celebrate 40 years since the brand’s founders raced together at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and 10 years since the conception of its very first tourbillon.\n\nThose who know Laurent Ferrier as a watchmaker today, may not realize that in the 1970’s he was much more well known on the racing circuits. In fact, he competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans seven times, coming first in the two-liter prototype category in 1977.During that time, he became friends with driver François Servanin and the two often raced together. It was not just their common love of racing, though, that brought them together. It was also a passion for mechanics. As such, they formed the Laurent Ferrier watch brand 10 years ago.\n\nThe new llimited edition Tourbillon Grand Sport is designed to recall the spirit of 1970s motor racing, and the watch features a smokey taupe colored dial with orange luminescent hands and indexes. The dial is enhanced by a tinted sapphire crystal and the 44mm stainless steel case features a cushion-shaped bezel against a tonneau shaped middle.\n\nFor the creation of this watch, Laurent Ferrier developed a new escapement mechanism that works in association with the tourbillon. The new caliber is chronometer certified by the Besancon Observatory. It is a mechanical hand-wound movement, entirely developed in house. It is equipped with a double balance-spring tourbillon. In typical Laurent Ferrier stye, each component is hand finished to exacting standards. The Tourbillon Grand Sport is being built in a limited edition of just 12 pieces, and each is water-resistant to 100 meters."
