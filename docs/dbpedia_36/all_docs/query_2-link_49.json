        "text": "Environmental Business Journal Recognizes Environmental Industry Firms for 2020 Performance and Innovation\n\nSan Diego, Calif. (February 2021) — Environmental Business Journal® (EBJ), a business research publication that has provided strategic business intelligence to the environmental industry since 1988, has honored Terracon with a 2020 EBJ Business Achievement Award for several major projects.\n\n“2020 was certainly an exceptional year for our society, the economy, and the environmental industry,” said Grant Ferrier, president of Environmental Business International Inc. (EBI Inc.), and editor of Environmental Business Journal. “That’s why we added two major categories to the EBJ Awards: COVID Resilience that recognizes companies that adapted to work-at-home, travel, field services and other restrictions, as well as rapidly changing client needs; and COVID Response that recognizes companies that developed or accelerated new business initiatives, innovations and entire business units to support the environmental, health, and safety needs of their diverse client sectors.”\n\nThe EBJ Business Achievement Awards customarily recognize business performance in conventional metrics such as revenue growth, mergers and acquisitions, exceptional projects, technology development and deployment in the field, and advances in information and digital technology, and these categories were well represented in 2020.\n\nTerracon was recognized for:\n\nBusiness Achievement: Mergers & Acquisitions, Kristi Tahmasiyan, SHR-SCP, director of mergers and acquisitions;\n\nCOVID Response: Workplace Reentry, John Sallman, P.G., assistant director of environmental services;\n\nInformation Technology: Stage1, Dana Wagner, CHMM, national manager of environmental due diligence services; and\n\nProject Merit: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Magnetometer Survey, Jim Major, P.G., investigation/remediation group leader.\n\n“Terracon congratulates all of the 2020 award recipients and is proud to be recognized by EBJ for the excellent work our own employee-owners are providing to our communities and clients,” said Lori Cathcart, assistant director of environmental services. “Despite the challenges we all experienced this past year, our team of environmental professionals continued to innovate and provide creative solutions to meet our clients’ most demanding needs.”\n\n2020 was also a unique year in that it represented what EBJ determined was the 50th anniversary of the environmental industry as a collection of 13 increasingly integrated segments in a $401 billion industry in the United States. Historical relics show active waste-management practices in Native American communities, and water and wastewater systems date back to pre-Roman history, but the environmental industry as we know it dates back to the foundation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and many of the companies that make up the Environmental Consulting & Engineering segment, in 1970.\n\nThe year 2020 was the 50th anniversary of the EPA, and the institution of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the President’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and other environmental protection initiatives at state and federal levels that endure today. The year 1970 also represents the foundation of a number of companies that still flourish today, and EBJ recognized many of these companies in 50-Year Recognition awards for companies founded in 1970 or thereabouts.\n\nThe 2020 EBJ awards were presented at a virtual ceremony Feb. 11 and 12, 2021. EBJ Business Achievement Awards are customarily presented in person at EBJ’s annual Environmental Industry Summit. The event was postponed from its usual mid-March date and held online in September 2020, followed by the recent awards ceremony. The expectation is for resumption of in-person events starting with Environmental Industry Summit XIX Sept. 22-24, 2021.\n\nAbout EBJ\n\nEnvironmental Business Journal provides strategic information and market forecasts for executives involved in 13 business segments, including environmental testing, water & wastewater, air pollution control, environmental consulting & engineering, hazardous waste, remediation, instrumentation, pollution control equipment, waste management, resource recovery, and solid waste management.\n\nAbout Terracon\n\nTerracon is an employee-owned engineering consulting firm with more than 5,000 employees providing environmental, facilities, geotechnical, and materials services from more than 150 offices with services available in all 50 states. Terracon ranks 22nd on Engineering News-Record’s 2020 list of Top 500 Design Firms."
