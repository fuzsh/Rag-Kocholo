        "text": "This Laurent Ferrier Galet Traveler exudes a certain natural sotto voce elegance, thanks to its perfect equilibrium and beautifully executed champlevé enamel dial depicting the night sky over the globe. The enameler’s attention to detail has gone so deep that the artist even painted the night lights in each region.\n\nThe present watch is part of an ultra exclusive series of only 5 watches cased in platinum specially made for London retailer William & Son.\n\nThe Galet Traveller is a superb modern take on the Patek Philippe dual time reference 2597 from the 1960s with two buttons on the case side that once pressed will move the hour hand backward or forward by one hour to set time in a new time zone, home time being elegantly displayed via an aperture at 9 o’clock, the date is displayed at 3 o’clock.\n\nThe Galet Traveller features a double direct-impulse natural escapement (an escapement devised by Breguet in the late 18th century and which very few watchmakers have managed to recreate) using two nickel phosphorous escape wheels and a silicon lever as ensuring better distribution of energy. The movement is also further beautifully hand decorated to the nth degree with a beautiful tapered rotor bridge, polished angles and Geneva waves.\n\nAfter over 37 years in product development at Patek Philippe, Laurent Ferrier decided to create his own brand, instead of taking advantage of a well-deserved retirement. 10 years on and he has managed to create a brand whose elegance, sophistication and cutting edge movements at a timeless testament of the glory age of watchmaking."
