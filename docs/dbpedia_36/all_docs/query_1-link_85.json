        "text": "3 ECH (CO)POLYMERIZATION\n\nAside from reactions involving ECH mentioned above, ECH is also an inexpensive feedstock for functional polymer materials including polyethers, polyesters, and poly(thio)carbonates, as can be seen in Figure 4. The (co)polymerizations of ECH can be difficult due to the reactive nature of the alkyl chloride pendant; Common and well-studied epoxide polymerization techniques like anionic ring opening polymerization (AROP) are not compatible with ECH. However, methods developed in the 1950's by Vandenberg allowed for the first time elastomeric copolymers containing ECH to be produced, spawning a new class of materials. Recent synthetic approaches, published within the last decade, are approaching the ease of synthesis of classical techniques, but with new found control over molecular weight (Mn), dispersity (Đ), end group(s), and architecture. These are broken down into several categories which will be discussed in the next section: cationic ring opening polymerization (CROP), double metal cyanide (DMC) catalyst, monomer activated ring opening polymerization (MAROP), and coordination polymerization. Furthermore, the alternating ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of ECH with cyclic anhydrides, CO2, and carbonyl sulfide (COS) will also be discussed. While modern methods and examples are the focus, a historical context of each of these methods will also be given. Please see these references if you are interested in the polymerization of epoxides beyond ECH.23, 25 This section begins with a history of the development of the Vandenberg catalyst and the synthesis of ECH-based Hydrin® elastomers.\n\n3.1 Historical synthesis, the Vandenberg catalyst\n\nThe synthesis of PECH has a rich history dating back to the 1950's that is intertwined with the development of metal and transition metal catalysts for polymer synthesis. In fact, ECH in particular led to the discovery of a widely-used and highly effective industrial catalyst for epoxide polymerizations, the Vandenberg catalyst, named after the discoverer, Edwin J. Vandenberg. Vandenberg has described, in his own words, the fascinating history of elastomeric PECH and its copolymers in a few publications over the years and the reader is encouraged to peruse those to get a complete picture.4, 26, 27 In this section, we will summarize the historical catalytic developments that led to the synthesis of this important class of polyethers.In 1955, Pruitt and Baggett on behalf of Dow Chemical Company patented a catalytic system for the polymerization of epoxides.2 The Pruitt and Baggett catalyst was formed from the reaction of iron halides (e.g., FeCl3) with propylene oxide (PO) and was found to polymerize a wide array of epoxides, including ECH. The resultant polymers were semi-crystalline. Academically, CC Price and co-workers at the University of Pennsylvania followed up on this work and developed a heterogeneous catalyst system consisting of aluminum isopropoxide and zinc chloride that effectively polymerized PO to high molecular weight.28-30\n\nDuring this time, EJ Vandenberg at Hercules, Inc. had been investigating expanding Ziegler-Natta-like catalysts to other monomer systems.4 The result of this work was an effective catalyst for vinyl ether polymerizations, which was formed from the reaction of alkyl aluminum and vanadium chloride (VCl4).4, 27 Vandenberg noted the similarities between his catalyst for vinyl ether polymerization and Price's catalyst for PO polymerization and so applied his catalyst to the polymerization of ECH. Fortuitously, the ECH monomer used in these initial investigations was from a bottle that had been around a long time and was nearly empty.27 This was moderately successful and resulted in a small amount of crystalline PECH. By dropping the transition metal, he obtained an amorphous rubbery PECH at much higher yield. He soon discovered the catalyst was no longer effective when new ECH monomer was used and determined that trace water in the old ECH monomer had reacted with the alkyl aluminum to form an effective catalyst. He confirmed this by directly reacting water with alkyl aluminum. This new class of cationic catalyst was very effective for the (co)polymerization of a wide variety of epoxides to high molecular weights. Vandenberg later reacted the alkyl aluminum – water catalyst with acetyl acetone, as seen in Figure 5, in an attempt to block a monomer coordination site to gain insight into some mechanistic aspects of epoxide polymerizations with the catalyst. He found this “aluminum chelate catalyst,” heretofore the Vandenberg catalyst, to be even more effective at polymerizing epoxides than the aluminum – water catalyst.4, 26, 27\n\nThe Vandenberg catalyst enabled the synthesis of several new, commercially viable, PECH-based rubber materials. Epoxides are polymerized with the Vandenberg catalyst through a coordination-insertion mechanism, as outlined in Figure 6.14 Polymers synthesized with the Vandenberg catalyst are high molecular weights, Mn > 106 g/mol, and majority atactic, making them ideal elastomers. Furthermore, the Vandenberg catalyst allowed for the facile synthesis of statistical copolymers made from functional epoxides, spawning elastomeric materials with a wide array of properties, known as Hydrin® elastomers.4 Hydrin® elastomers, now produced by Zeon Chemicals in Japan, consist of ECH and one or more other epoxide monomers, namely, ethylene oxide (EO) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE), as seen in Figure 7. These copolymers are used in several different contexts, but are especially apt for applications where good solvent resistance and thermal stability are required like in automotive applications. Aside from epoxides, the Vandenberg catalyst has recently found use in other (co)polymerization contexts as well. In 2017, Chwatko and Lynd demonstrated the homopolymerization of lactones and the statistical copolymerization of lactones and epoxides, including ECH.31\n\nWhile the Vandenberg catalyst defined the synthesis of PECH at the time, there are still a few drawbacks to this synthetic method. Epoxide polymerizations with Vandenberg's catalyst are marked by limited control over Mn and Đ; Polymers are always high molecular weight (Mn > 106 g/mol) and generally high dispersity (Đ > 2).26, 32 Therefore, low (Mn < 104 g/mol) and intermediate (106 > Mn > 104) Mn polymers were unachievable. The reason for the uncontrolled Mn is at least partially due to the lack of understanding of the initiating and catalytic species that make up the Vandenberg catalyst; Reacting water with tri-alkyl aluminum and acetyl acetone produces a large number of side reactions and so the catalytically active species was unknown.26, 33 Some work over the years has been invested in understanding the polymerization mechanism behind this culminating in a recent report by Ferrier, Mendoza-Cortes, and Lynd.32 Due to these concerns and general interest in synthesizing a broader array of PECH (co)polymers, other synthetic methods have been developed, the best of which being revealed in the last decade or so.\n\n3.2 Beyond Vandenberg: Modern ECH polymerization approaches\n\nMoving on from Vandenberg's catalyst for ECH polymerization has been difficult. PECH syntheses over the past several decades have been marked by complex and/or costly procedures, low molecular weights and limited molecular weight control, and sparse compositional control. However, reports in the last two decades have revealed a rich tapestry of synthetic approaches that allow for the controlled (co)polymerization of ECH. In this section, modern approaches for ECH (co)polymerization will be highlighted, including recent reports utilizing these methods, along with a brief history of each of these methods as it relates to ECH (co)polymerization. Table 1 summarizes major methods discussed for ECH polymerization in terms of Mn range and Đ.\n\n3.2.1 Cationic ring opening polymerization of ECH\n\nThe CROP of ECH was demonstrated decades ago. CROPs of ECH proceed through two different possible mechanisms: activated chain end mechanism (ACE) and activated monomer (AM) mechanism, both of which can be seen in Figure 8.41 In ACE, the oxonium ion at the chain end forms the propagating center and is usually initiated by a combination of protogenic species like water and protonic acids, organic salts, and Lewis acids. This method generally results in the formation of oligomeric linear and cyclic PECH due to side reactions like chain transfer, backbiting and termination. In the early 1980's, the AM mechanism for the cationic polymerization of epoxides in the presence of alcohols was proposed,42 which was demonstrated experimentally by Okamoto43 and later by Penczek.35 In AM, the monomer forms an ionic complex with a protonic species like an alcohol and the polymer chain end is neutral, which reduces backbiting. Low instantaneous concentration of ECH monomer compared to the protonic species is necessary for the polymerization to be controlled and this can be accomplished by slow addition of ECH to the reaction. Low molecular weight diols can be used to produce telechelic PECH, which is useful as polyurethane precursors.35 Generally, AM is significantly more controlled than ACE, but produces PECH at low Mn (Mn < 2500 g/mol). It should be noted that some cationic metal complexes are able to polymerize epoxides to high Mn and narrow Đ, although this is uncommon.44There have been few recent developments of CROP for ECH polymerization, but some recent examples are mentioned here. Hafner et al. copolymerized ECH and 1,2 epoxyhexane (EH) from a diol catalyzed by BF3*THF up to ca. 2500 g/mol.45 The EH acted to reduce Tg and the ECH was modified with azide units to create an energetic binder system. Another recent example using the same catalyst system, but initiated by lignin to create lignin based polyols was presented by Perez-Arce et al.46 Yagci and co-workers used a photoinitiated cationic polymerization method to co-polymerize ECH with cyclohexene oxide (CHO) up to 4800 g/mol and THF up to 20,000 g/mol.47 Here they used bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide (BAPO) and diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate (Ph2I+PF6−) as the photoinitiating system which allowed them to simultaneously perform an azide-yne click reaction between azide modified PECH and alkyne modified polymers to create graft copolymers.\n\nCationic copolymerization of ECH with lactones has recently been explored. Bednarek et al. used a traditional AM method with alcohol as initiator and triflic acid as catalyst to synthesize block and statistical copolymers of functional epoxides including ECH and L-lactide.48 In all cases, Mn remained relatively low (ca. 4000 g/mol), but inclusion of functional groups via the epoxide was evident. In another recent example, Mehrkhodavandi and co-workers developed an Indium-salen complex that cationically polymerized ECH up to ca. 40 kg/mol with relatively narrow dispersity (Đ < 1.3).49-51 This system also effectively copolymerized ECH with THF, oxetane, oxepane, and lactide to make some interesting copolymers.\n\n3.2.2 Double metal cyanide catalysts\n\nOver the past two decades, an abundance of academic research into double metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts for the cationic polymerization of epoxides generally and ECH in particular has been published. DMC catalysts are industrial, heterogeneous catalysts that were first developed by General Tire and Rubber in 1966, originally for the preparation of polyols for polyurethane production.52 DMC catalysts are produced from the precipitation of a metal salt (e.g., ZnCl2) and a metal cyanide salt (e.g., K3Co[CN]6) in the presence of tert-buyl alcohol and a polyvalent alcohol (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)) that act as complexing agents. Figure 9 shows an example of a DMC catalyst and a proposed mechanism for the ROP of ECH with this catalyst. DMC catalysts are marked by their functional group tolerance and so are suitable for ECH and other functional epoxide (co)polymerizations. Generally, a fraction of high Mn polymer is produced with the DMC catalyzed polymerization of epoxides, but this does not seem to be the case for ECH.Literature involving the polymerization of ECH with DMC catalysts is sparse. In 2012, Gu et al. polymerized ECH with DMC catalysts using an isocyanate as an initiator to make a polyurethane elastomer.53 In 2014, Wei et al. prepared regio-regular PECH with controlled molecular weights up to 4.2 kg/mol with Đ > 1.4 using DMC catalysts.36 By using racemic mixtures or enantiopure ECH, the authors were able to make thermoplastic or semi-crystalline PECH, respectively. Kim and co-workers, in 2019, studied many of the mechanistic aspects of DMC polymerization of epoxides, including ECH.54 They found ECH uniquely did not result in the production of high molecular weight species when polymerized without a specific initiator. However, PECH produced this way was low molecular weight (ca. 1 kg/mol) and the authors speculated this was due to premature termination of the polymerization through the pendant Cl. Therefore, little work has been done on the homopolymerization of ECH with DMC catalysts and the work that has done seems to produce PECH at low molecular weight similar to traditional CROP methods.\n\n3.2.3 Monomer activated anionic ring opening polymerization\n\nOxyanionic polymerization methods are some of the oldest synthetic routes for epoxide polymerization, but traditional anionic ring opening polymerization (AROP) approaches are not viable for the polymerization of ECH. In fact, traditional AROP has difficulty polymerizing several functional epoxides to high molecular weight due to chain transfer reactions. Carlotti and Deffieux were able to overcome this issue through a monomer activated ring opening polymerization (MAROP) approach with an anionic initiating complex that allowed for Mn > 100 kg/mol of monomers like propylene oxide (PO) and butylene oxide (BO).55, 56 The authors followed this up a couple years later with controlled, high Mn polymerizations of ECH.37 In a typical ECH polymerization, tri-isobutyl aluminum (TIBA) and tetraoctylammonium bromide (NOct4Br) work in concert; The TIBA activates ECH and forms a complex with NOct4Br that attacks the activated ECH. The mechanism is shown in Figure 10. Due to the dual role of the TIBA as both activator and as part of the initiator complex, an excess of TIBA with respect to NOct4Br is necessary for effective polymerization; At the highest Mn targeted, a 5.4 times excess of TIBA to NOct4Br was required to polymerize ECH. In this way, Carlotti and Deffieux were able to achieve controlled Mn of atactic PECH up to 83,500 g/mol at room temperature, significantly higher than previous cationic polymerization attempts and approaching results of Vandenberg's catalyst and other coordinative methods, while maintaining low Đ (Đ < 1.2). Due to the large excess of TIBA used, removing the residual TIBA from the final polymer can be difficult as common methods, like precipitation, are not sufficient. Furthermore, hetero-bifunctional polymers are produced with one end group determined by the salt. Aside from NOct4Br/TIBA, other initiating complexes have been utilized to polymerize epoxides such as phosphazene base/alcohol/TIBA57 and phosphazene base/alcohol/triethylboron,58 but they have not been used for ECH polymerization.\n\nBecause MAROP is compatible with several functional epoxides, statistical and block copolymers containing ECH were able to be controllably synthesized. In the original report of MAROP of ECH, Carlotti and Deffieux synthesized statistical copolymers of PO and ECH and AGE and ECH59 up to 30,000 g/mol with narrow Đ. Lynd, Hawker and co-workers60 as well as Frey and co-workers61 used a similar procedure to produce statistical co-polymers of EO and ECH. Lynd transformed the ECH unit in the copolymers to methylene ethylene oxide (MEO) using potassium tert-butoxide. The MEO unit could be easily cleaved with dilute solutions of trifluoroacetic acid, leading to degradable PEGs. Wang and co-workers also copolymerized ECH and EO by using ethylene glycol potassium as initiator with TIBA as the activator.62 Polystyrene and polyisoprene were then grafted to the P(EO-co-ECH) via displacement of the Cl with terminal 1,1-diphenylethylene−Li+. Moller and Keul synthesized statistical and block copolymers of ECH and ethoxy ethyl glycidyl ether (EEGE), which could be post-modified to create pendants containing alcohol and primary amines.63 MAROP is an extremely versatile and facile method for the synthesis of ECH (co)polymers due to the simple initiator preparation, functional group tolerance, and the ability to reach intermediate molecular weights.\n\n3.2.4 Coordinative methods for ECH (co)polymerization\n\nThere are several historical coordination catalysts for ECH polymerization, some of which were mentioned in Section 3.1. The polymerization mechanism is similar between other coordination catalyst systems and the Vandenberg catalyst, but the composition of the catalysts varies wildly. For instance, Wu and Shen64 used rare-Earth metals coordinated with acetyl acetonate in addition to water and TIBA to create their catalyst and found that Nd was particularly effective in this context to polymerize several epoxides including ECH. The metal porphyrin-metal catalysts synthesized by Inoue are particularly important, leading to “immortal” polymerizations of ECH to controlled molecular weights.65, 66 Several of this class of catalyst were developed by Inoue and allowed not only the copolymerization of ECH with other epoxides but also copolymerization of ECH with other heterocycles like lactones.67 There are several other classic systems to mention here and the authors encourage the reader to check out recent reviews for a broader look at this area.25, 44 This section will mention two recent examples of interest, both an evolution on work done by Vandenberg in the 1960's and 1970's.\n\nA classical catalyst system for the polymerization of epoxides has been recently investigated to make ECH copolymers. The catalyst system consists of TIBA, pure phosphoric acid, and a Lewis base (e.g., triphenyl phosphine) and was explored by Vandenberg and others in the 1960's and 1970's.68 The system was found effective for ECH and other epoxide polymerizations and is thought to proceed through a coordinative mechanism with anionic character. In 2000, Mason and co-workers developed a structurally defined catalyst based on Vandenberg's work which were derived from the reaction of methyl phosphonic acid with trialkyl aluminum.38 These catalysts were effective for the homopolymerization of ECH to Mn > 100 kg/mol, but with Đ = 1.9. In 2001, Zu and co-workers69 further explored this system by adding water as a fourth component. The authors investigated the performance of this “quaternary catalyst” system on the polymerization of ECH and other epoxides by varying relative concentrations of the different components and Lewis base type. Interestingly, in copolymerizations involving ECH, the authors found that addition of the second monomer (e.g., PO, EO, and AGE) was favored significantly over addition of ECH based on the reactivity ratios, with rECH*r2 < 1, resulting in a statistical copolymer with alternating character.\n\nWork published very recently in 2018 and 2019 by Li, Guo, and co-workers70, 71 followed a similar procedure from Zu's work, but dropped the water and used 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as the Lewis base. At very specific ratios of TIBA/phosphoric acid/DBU, the authors were able to produce high molecular weight (up to 300 kg/mol) with moderate Đ (Đ ≈ 1.5) statistical terpolymers of ECH, EO, and either furfuryl glycidyl ether (FGE) or propargyl glycidyl ether (PGE). Homopolymer PECH was not synthesized. The ECH/EO/FGE containing copolymer could be reversibly crosslinked via a Diels–Alder (DA) reaction between the furfuryl group and an added bi-functional maleimide. The ECH/EO/PGE copolymer was used to create star polymers through addition of a diepoxide crosslinker after the ECH/EO/PGE monomer had been consumed. This copolymer is a highly functional polymer platform with addressable pendant moieties that can be addressed orthogonally (e.g., “click” reactions of the alkyne, displacement of the Cl). In both papers, reactivity ratios were calculated for each of the monomer pairs with rEO*rECH, rPGE*rECH, and rFGE*rECH being nearly 1 in all cases indicating a statistical copolymerization. While this catalyst system is quite effective for the synthesis of ECH copolymers, the initiating species is unknown and polymer end groups have not been characterized.\n\nRecent work by Ferrier, Lynd and co-workers32, 39, 72, 73 and later by Ferrier,40 has detailed an aluminum-based catalyst-initiator system for the polymerization of epoxides. This work is directly descended from Vandenberg's work and originally sought to better understand the mechanistic aspects of Vandenberg's catalyst.32 The initiative and catalytic species were formed from the reaction of an amine containing alcohol ligand (i.e., dibenzyl amino ethanol) and a trialkyl aluminum (i.e., triethyl aluminum) at a 1:2.1 ratio which formed a mono(μ-oxo)bis(alkylaluminum) (MOB) species.39 An example of the synthetic scheme can be seen in Figure 11(A). The MOB was crystallized out of the reaction medium and was therefore pure and the structure determined through X-ray crystallography. This system allowed for the synthesis of atactic PECH up to 100 kg/mol with relatively low Đ < 1.3 as well as the synthesis of copolymers containing ECH and other epoxides like AGE, PO, BO, and so forth. Burkey et al. used this polymerization method to create non-toxic polymers for cryopreservation.74 The authors synthesized PECH up to 70 kg/mol and replaced the Cl units with a sulfoxide to create poly(methyl glycidyl sulfoxide) which they used to study ice recrystallization. Rodriguez et al. used this polymerization technique to create CO2 separation membranes consisting of ECH, n-butyl glycidyl ether, and other monomers cross-linked diepoxide functional oligomeric ethylene oxide.75\n\nLater iterations improved reaction kinetics and control. Lynd, Ferrier, and co-workers varied the alkyl substitutions on the aluminum72 and on the amine of the alcohol ligand,73 to investigate kinetic effects. They found kinetics were enhanced with smaller alkyls on the amine and bulkier alkyls on the aluminum. The enhanced kinetics led to polymerizations being completed in minutes at mild temperatures while maintaining Mn and dispersity control. Most recently, the catalyst and initiator portions were separated, with the so-called “NAl catalyst” formed from the reaction of triethylamine and trimethyl aluminum and the initiator formed from an alcohol73 or thiol40 containing ligand reacted with trimethyl aluminum. Examples of the initiator structures as well as the NAl catalyst structure can be seen in Figure 11(B,C), respectively. The separated form maintains epoxide functional group tolerance and high molecular weight PECH synthesis (Mn up to at least 100 kg/mol), and allows for the synthesis of heterobifunctional PECH, with the end group corresponding to the alcohol or thiol ligand that forms the initiator. This is a very exciting system for the synthesis of PECH and ECH-containing copolymers as the initiating species is well-defined and tunable and we have so far demonstrated exceptional functional group tolerance.\n\n3.2.5 Ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) involving ECH\n\nThe alternating ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides with CO2 or cyclic anhydrides is a robust way to make polycarbonates or polyesters, respectively. ROCOP allows for the fine tuning of polymer properties by switching out one epoxide for another. This technique was first demonstrated in the 1960s with some exceptional work being done that allowed for polycarbonates and polyesters to be made with a wide variety of epoxides, but especially featuring ECH.76-80 However, these classical methods typically resulted in low Mn or high Đ. While much work has been done in the intervening decades between the first demonstrations of ROCOP and now, it is within the last decade that significant advancement of this field has taken place. There are several exceptional reviews written about this field and we encourage the reader to explore those for a broader view.81-85 Our review is focused on ROCOP methods involving ECH.Recent work involving well-defined metal complexes has enabled the synthesis of ECH-based polyesters through the ROCOP of ECH and cyclic anhydrides. In 2011, Coates and co-workers demonstrated ROCOP of ECH and maleic anhydride (MA) using a Cr (III) salen complex.86 They were able to achieve unsaturated polyesters with ECH up to 25 kg/mol, Đ ≈ 1.5 with <1% ether content. Similarly, in 2013, Liu et al. used a binuclear Cr salan complex to copolymerize MA and ECH up to 33 kg/mol with Đ = 1.6.87 Zhou et al produced block polyesters in one pot through the terpolymerization of ECH, several anhydrides, and lactide using a binary catalyst system of half salen-Al(III) and bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride (PPNCl).88 The ECH/anhydride alternating polymerization proceeded first followed by the ROP of lactide resulting in block copolymers up to 40 kg/mol with Đ < 1.54. Very recently, Ding et al. produced polyesters from ROCOP of ECH with 5-norbornene-2-3-dicarboxylic anhydride (NA) using a Cr(III) catalyst and PPNCl co-catalyst.89 They were able to produce regioregular polymers up to 10 kg/mol and could crosslink the system through the addition of sodium azide through replacement of the Cl of ECH followed by cycloaddition with the unsaturated bond of the norbornene ring.\n\nThe production of polycarbonates from the reaction of ECH and CO2 is a decades old problem. CO2 can be readily copolymerized with a slew of functional epoxides. However, epoxides with electron-withdrawing functional groups like ECH and styrene oxide are particularly difficult to copolymerize; stable cyclic carbonates can form via backbiting and/or the polycarbonate anion can attack the carbon atom linked to the—CH2Cl group, which in limited polycarbonate formation.90, 91 Significant advancements in this area have been made over the last decade. Darensbourg and co-workers reported a homogeneous salen-CO (III) bi- functional catalyst that was effective for the perfectly alternating copolymerization of ECH and CO2.90 Two years later, in 2013, the same group published the stereospecific alternating copolymerization of the same monomers with Mn up to 20 kg/mol and narrow Đ ≈ 1.2.92 However, these catalysts still produced cyclic carbonates at room temperature. In the same year, Wei et al. applied a nanolamellar Zn-Co (III) DMC catalyst to this reaction, with less cyclic carbonate content, but also resulting in only 70% carbonate content and high Đ (>2.0).93 In 2016, Yoon and co-workers utilized zinc glutarate as a heterogeneous catalyst for the alternating copolymerization of ECH and CO2 and were able to achieve polycarbonate selectivity up to 98%, while suppressing cyclic carbonate formation, although this resulted in Đ > 2.0.94 Finally, earlier this year, Wu and co-workers developed an organoboron catalyst consisting of four Lewis acidic 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane centers and a central quaternary ammonium halide.95 This catalyst was found to be extremely effective for CO2/ECH copolymerization with Mn up to 36 kg/mol with Đ ≈ 1.2 and resulted in >99% polymer selectivity and >99% carbonate linkages at room temperature. Therefore, several effective strategies for the preparation of this functional polycarbonate have been developed over the last decade.\n\nSimilar to CO2, ROCOP of ECH and carbonyl sulfide (COS) has also been explored recently to create polymonothiocarbonate materials. Sulfur containing polymers have good optical properties, chemical resistance, and chelation abilities.96-99 Perfectly alternating copolymerization of COS with epoxides offers a promising method to create these materials. Only a few recent examples in the literature exist of ECH copolymerization with COS. In 2016, Ren and co-workers used a bi-functional Cr complex to copolymerize enantiopure ECH with COS to produce semicrystalline polythiocarbonates.100, 101 They found they could achieve molecular weights up to 3100 g/mol by utilizing a low temperature (−25°C) which suppressed a chain termination pathway that resulted in the formation of an epoxide at the chain end. In a later paper, they exploited this terminal epoxide group in order to make branched polythiocarbonates with ECH and COS in a one pot procedure.102, 103 In this way, the authors were able to achieve polythiocarbonates up to 36,000 g/mol by tuning side-chain lengths through reaction temperature.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1R.
