        "text": "The phrase “independent watchmaker” has two fundamentally different meanings. One refers to a large industrial brand like Rolex that operates independently from a corporate group. These manufacturing firms are sometimes—and perhaps more accurately—referred to as an “independent watch brand” or “independent watch company.” Another meaning of “independent watchmaker” is a very small maison, atelier, or individual that practices small-scale, high-end watchmaking.\n\n“Independent watchmaking is really when you distill this whole industry down to a single person working at a bench as a craft,” Logan Baker, Senior Editorial Manager of Phillips, tells Robb Report. “It’s someone that’s building a product for a person. And that’s what the best independent watchmakers do. They’re putting their heart and soul into what they view is the most ideal, the most perfect mechanism and that can take its form through more creative designs, or pioneering mechanics. It just really depends on where that watchmaker wants to take their product.”\n\nIt is these small, high-end independent watchmakers we are celebrating here, the masters of the craft, design, tools and technology that drive today’s high horology. From well-known masters like Philippe Dufour, F. P. Journe, and Kari Voutilainen to up-and-coming makers such as Japan’s Naoya Hida and Hajime Asaoka, China’s Qin Gan, and watchmaking duo Petermann Bédat, we take you into the micro-worlds of the 25 best independents working around the world today.\n\nSome firms are larger than others, of course. There’s the single person working alone like Asaoka, and then there’s a firm like Moritz Grossman employing roughly 30 watchmakers in Germany. But none of these watchmakers produce very many watches each year—some vanishingly few, none more than a few hundred—and all are working at the highest level.\n\nRegardless of their size (and perhaps because they are small), when aficionados speak of independent watchmakers, it is often with a reverent, even awe-struck, tone. Collectors almost universally agree that a small atelier creating exceptionally well-crafted watches simultaneously honors horological tradition while pushing watchmaking into the future. Some collectors regard independents as preservationists protecting traditional watchmaking from extinction, while others consider them mavericks pushing horology toward unseen horizons. They have also come to revere independents as a more unique alternative to larger and more traditionally esteemed high-end brands.\n\nHowever, these two impulses—one toward the past, one toward the future—are almost always intertwined. As a result, independent watchmaking can take any number of mechanical and aesthetic directions, resulting in wildly different watches. For centuries, mechanical watchmaking sat at the bleeding-edge of human technology. In our AI-driven world, our nostalgia can cause us to forget that what seems quaint today was the futuristic wonder of yesteryear. So, we’d be mistaken to arbitrarily reject makers using digitally driven multi-axis CNC machines, 3D printers, and CAD software as integral to their high horology. These tools have become as much a part of the independent watchmaker’s workflow as the foot-driven polishing wheels of the 18th-century or the electronic guilloche machines of the 19th. But the handcraft is always involved, and it’s what you see in the end.\n\nWhile these watches are invariably quite expensive, Baker points out that, “There is no real considerations of commercial business.” In other words, no one heads into independent watchmaking to get rich, which may seem to contradict the amount of money one can imagine some of these folks have earned over the years. The path to this kind of success often comes after years of financial struggle—not unlike that of a painter or sculptor. Some well-connected and informed watch collectors seek out the unknowns before they blow up, just as art collectors scour the small galleries for works from rising talents. Whether that impulse is driven by a profiteering motive, a love of discovery, or the dream of owning something special before it’s too expensive isn’t a question we can answer, but we can assure you our list will whet many appetites. Indeed, this list contains some living legends, and others who may very well follow in their footsteps to become legends of 21st century watchmaking.\n\nBelow are the 25 best independent watchmakers working today."
