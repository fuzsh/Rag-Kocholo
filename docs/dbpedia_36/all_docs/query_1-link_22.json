I'm looking for information about the company & the watches.\n\n84935 posts ·\n\n#3 ·\n\nIMHO, somewhat similar to the H. Moser brand in terms of designs. Elegant and classy.\n\nGood looking watch.\n\nGood luck with your research.\n\n1397 posts ·\n\n#4 ·\n\nI can't find much either. They're known to the people in that sort of sphere, and are indeed capable of making a high quality, very well finished watch. But at the same time, they're like most independents: they don't have much of a story, they make pretty things, and they're pretty expensive. If I could, maybe I'd get one, but my tastes take me elsewhere. Mosso's done some good reviews on the Watchbox Reviews channel insofar as the details are concerned. If you want the straight-up takes, he'll probably deliver them. That said, it's hard to know much more about them. If you ever happen to be in Geneva, they offer tours according to their FAQ.\n\npmw_jr Discussion starter\n\n70 posts ·\n\n#6 ·\n\nThe pedigree is great, the pieces are great and Laurent Ferrier seems to be friends with all the right people.\n\nA tour of their operations would be fantastic but requires a 10 hour flight to Geneva! 😢\n\n0 Reply\n\n724 posts ·\n\n#5 ·\n\nI cannot help you, either.

Lot's of great video and information. In general, if you are going to get one, I would opt for at least the micro-rotor, as the models below the micro-rotor seem to lack in the same great finishing.\n\n11 posts ·\n\n#9 ·\n\nI have the 2020 Wrist Watch Annual and it gives a bit of the back story, but nothing more than has already been mentioned here.

Lovely and elegant watches With understated designs.\n\nThey seem under appreciated.\n\nThat’s my thinking too. Everyone rushes to buy Patek or Audemars, meanwhile LF and others fly under the radar. But to each his own…\n\nShow more replies\n\n0 Reply\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#12 ·\n\nIf you already read about his time at Patek and then going out to start his own company, I am not sure what else you want to know. If it is watch specific, then the articles you call \"fluff pieces\" are pretty much where you are going to get details of what went into designing the specific models and they should also provide details of the watches specifications.\n\nWatch designs are not flashy and mostly go under the radar with most people that are not in the know. I own 3 pieces (a Classic Micro-Rotor, a Traveller and a Sport Auto) and I get compliments all the time but it's not like people say.....love your LF.....they will typically say that is a gorgeous watch who makes it or something like that. The brand did sort of \"fly under the radar\" for a while but people that are interested in higher-end independents certainly know about it. The recently introduced Sport Auto has a +3 year long waitlist last time I heard so it certainly is no longer an under the radar.\n\nHonestly the best way for you to research the brand is to go to an AD and try one on to experience the understated elegance of the watches. The dials and the movements are stunning.\n\npmw_jr Discussion starter\n\n70 posts ·\n\n#13 ·\n\nOne final questions - whtat's the process for servicing a watch like LF assuming the comany isn't around any longer? I'm not suggesting LF is going out of business (and I hope it never does!), but with smaller independens there's always the risk that things turn south. I guess this question is more aplicable to microbrands in general, not just LF.\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#14 ·\n\nThis is a risk you are always going to take when you buy from a smaller independent brand. More than likely if a brand like LF fails under the current owners it will be taken over by someone else. There are just too many brands that are in a similar situation that this could happen to that sell great timepieces that I wouldn't want to pass on thinking about it......like FPJ, Grönefeld, Romain Gauthier, Moser, Czapek, even Voutilainen, etc., etc., etc. Overall I think most pieces should be able to be serviced later by a qualified watchmaker.\n\n0 Reply\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#15 ·\n\n@pmw_jr Where are you located? Did you check the AD listing to see if there is one near you? Watchbox and European Watch will sometimes also have a couple of preowned pieces in stock.\n\npmw_jr Discussion starter\n\n70 posts ·\n\n#16 ·\n\nI’ll check it out.\n\n11 posts ·\n\n#17 ·\n\nAgree with @christianj - If you own ANY of the smaller boutique brands, it just makes sense to make friends with your local watchmaker. Especially once they are out of warrantee.\n\n1157 posts ·\n\n#19 ·\n\nYes but these days your typical \"local watchmaker\" is going to be able to clean and lubricate a movement and if necessary, swap out some off the shelf parts. But if pieces such as this actually have fully custom movements then good luck find a true watchmaker who would be able to create parts from scratch if needed. To use a car analogy, if all you ever need are oil changes and new tires, you are good, but if a piston cracks you will be in for some pain.\n\nShow more replies\n\n1 Reply\n\n131 posts ·\n\n#20 ·\n\nI’m only familiar with the manufacturer because Clyde from the Archieverse got one. It looks nice but I personally wouldn’t consider it. I’d go Patek, AP or JLC for a dress timepiece.\n\n51 posts ·\n\n#24 ·\n\nToo much talk about the risk of going independent guys. I’d much rather look at the upside. These are watches that you buy when you want something else than the ubiquitous Rolex, or certain Patek and AP that you see on Instagram all the time. LF pieces are very refined and restrained but at the same time a lot more sensual and romantic than, say, a Lange. They’re not for everyone, but I happen to like them - a lot. I recently bought my first LF (a manual wound Classic Origin, which can be considered the gateway into LF) and have been suitably impressed so far.\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#26 ·\n\nToo much talk about the risk of going independent guys. I’d much rather look at the upside.\n\nI agree! I buy what I like and there is always a slight consideration of the stability of the brand when buying independent however that is not my main focus. Glad to hear you are enjoying your first LF!\n\n0 Reply\n\n139 posts ·\n\n#25 ·\n\nWhat I think is it's a really nice watch but I would not buy it.\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#27 ·\n\nSome pics for those tempted! Laurent Ferrier Sport Auto (Sorry about the fuzz on the dial!)\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#28 ·\n\nLaurent Ferrier Classic Micro Rotor White Enamel Dial\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#29 ·\n\nLaurent Ferrier Galet Square Blue - recently left my collection when I added a Traveller to my collection with a blue dial (just realized I have no pics of the Traveller on my phone)\n\nSent from my iPhone View attachment 17731178\n\n521 posts ·\n\n#30 ·\n\nI absolutely love this brand. I only have one of their watches - one of the Revolution LEs, but maybe someday I will be able to add another (sport auto, down the line, perhaps? Or the classic origin with degradé blue dial?).\n\nLF is somewhat of a family business. His son, Christian, designs the movements. The movements are designed in house, but the components are made by La Fabrique du Temps, where Christian Ferrier used to work.Fabrique du Temps is owned by LVMH so I down the line I don’t think parts or repair will be an issue.\n\nBack to the watches….I don’t know what it is about them, but I think all of their watches are incredibly beautiful. The shapes of the cases are very elegant and smooth….kind of like a pebble that has been smoothed over by years in the ocean. The hands are absolutely gorgeous. They are just incredibly well done. The minute hand gets so thin at the center and is perfectly polished and rounded. There is an overall timeless elegance about them, and the closer you look, the more impressed you are. And the finishing on the movement is just insane. Anglage a mile wide, black polish components, inner angles, etc. The fact that the micro rotor uses a natural escapement which is done almost nowhere else is also really cool for the escapement/movement nerds among us.\n\nAnyways I will end this post with paraphrasing something i heard a year or two ago on a watchbox podcast, the trading desk. Josh was saying that he sold a collector a LF who said that after buying that, it made his other holy trinity watches look like tissots - which I found amusing.\n\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk\n\n3216 posts ·\n\n#31 ·\n\nI have so much love for LF, though he doesn't think very highly of AR coating on his watches – they're damn-near impossible to photograph or view under anything but perfect lighting conditions.\n\nSpectacular movements, and very organic, beautifully designed cases too. Would love to own one someday.\n\n837 posts ·\n\n#32 ·\n\nI am surprised that LF did not go out of business during COVID like some other Independents. They seem to have trouble with leadership. Going through 4 different CEOs in the past 6 - 7 years is not a good look. In addition, the lesser known accusation that their micro rotor movement was not designed in-house. LF apparently source third party movement maker to design the mircro rotor movement for them. There are other examples of many other watch company with very similar micro rotor movement.\n\nWhile I love their Galet Square and pebble design, i feel that their prices are not worth what they are asking, even in the preowned space.\n\n521 posts ·\n\n#38 ·\n\nMovements are designed and assembled in house but manufactured by La Fabrique du Temps\n\n0 Reply\n\n12363 posts ·\n\n#33 ·\n\nI am surprised that LF did not go out of business during COVID like some other Independents.\n\nGetting off topic, but which ones went out of business?\n\n837 posts ·\n\n#35 ·\n\nRomain Jerome and HYT are the ones that comes to mind.\n\nThere are more but here is article with some brands that are gone.\n\nIn Memoriam: People And Brands Who Left Us In 2020 - Quill & Pad\n\nThe Latin phrase “in memoriam” is often used in place of “in memory of.” And to my mind, people also use it to signify departed who may be gone but shouldn’t be forgotten.

However, I believe that 6119 will continue to drop in price.\n\nI can get a Patek World timer 5230 or A. Lange & Sohne Lange one moonphase at 30k and that would be a better buy. Which leads me to my point that LF preowned at 30k is a hard bargain especially when you are up against such a stable and well know companies like Patek, Vacheron, ALS, ect. that offer more in terms of function.\n\n0 Reply\n\n4 posts ·\n\n#39 ·\n\nI'm considering LF as well but the two-piece crown mentioned in the post shared by GrouchoM is quite concerning, off-putting even. Can someone expand on if I should worry about that?\n\n1112 posts ·\n\n#40 ·\n\nNot sure one report should make you question their quality. Ive had no issues with the three I own.\n\nShow more replies\n\n0 Reply\n\n2202 posts ·\n\n#42 ·\n\nTo me, LF occupies a weird spot.\n\nThey stop shy of excellent quality finishing, and don’t really offer anything too unique. Not compelling enough to go independent…\n\nSomeone in a similar price bracket is Armin Strom. A watch like their mirrored force resonance model is way more interesting. A truly unique complication, higher quality finishing, customization, etc.\n\nLF are a lot less used btw. Do not buy new! Let someone else eat the depreciation for you."
