Joshua Munchow appreciates the watch’s simplicity and legibility and feels that it’s a perfect example of what an annual calendar can be.\n\nhttps://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Laurent-Ferrier-Galet-Annual-Calendar-Montre-Ecole-9W0B7879.jpg 1600 1600 Joshua Munchow http://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/logo-header-scroll-qandp-335x193.png Joshua Munchow2018-12-30 21:39:302024-03-07 09:56:11Laurent Ferrier Galet Annual Calendar Montre École: Back To School\n\nThe Schmidt List: Top 5 Funky Clicks\n\n///\n\nThe click spring is one of the smaller components of a mechanical watch, but it is of enormous importance. Ever wondered why the crown doesn’t retaliate furiously and unwind every time you crank it? Without the click spring, a wound mainspring would immediately – and explosively – uncoil like a raging viper in a hat box.\n\nhttps://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Laurent-Ferrier-Galet-Tourbillon_click_2586.jpg 687 1030 Ryan Schmidt http://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/logo-header-scroll-qandp-335x193.png Ryan Schmidt2017-09-16 17:59:562018-12-27 18:39:29The Schmidt List: Top 5 Funky Clicks\n\nLaurent Ferrier x Urwerk Arpal One For Only Watch 2017: The Past, Present, And Future Of Horology In One Unique Watch (First Live Photos)\n\n///\n\nThere are 50 unique timepieces being auctioned at Only Watch 2017, each exceptional in some way. But three of these timepieces stand out as being more unique than the rest in that they are not simply unique variations of existing watches, but the culmination of completely one-off projects. By far the shiniest of these is the Laurent Ferrier x Urwerk Arpal One.\n\nhttps://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Laurent-FerrierxUrwerk-OW17_1.jpg 1291 1200 Ian Skellern http://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/logo-header-scroll-qandp-335x193.png Ian Skellern2017-09-08 18:08:102019-09-17 11:36:05Laurent Ferrier x Urwerk Arpal One For Only Watch 2017: The Past, Present, And Future Of Horology In One Unique Watch (First Live Photos)\n\nMy 2017 SIHH Highlights, Shot With A Leica Q\n\n///\n\nAt the 2017 SIHH in Geneva I particularly liked the Carré des Horlogers, as the SIHH independents’ hall is known, which showcases some of the industry’s finest creative minds producing amazing watches, both traditional and contemporary. So without further ado, here are my SIHH highlights, most of which come from that hall.\n\nhttps://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Urwerk-UR-T8_wrist_L1140540.jpg 800 1200 Simon Cudd http://quillandpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/logo-header-scroll-qandp-335x193.png Simon Cudd2017-03-08 18:40:302019-01-02 09:54:11My 2017 SIHH Highlights, Shot With A Leica Q\n\nSIHH 2017 Round Table: What We Liked And What We Didn’t Like (Warning: Modem-Burning Photo Fest!)\n\n///\n\nPlease join our Quill & Pad round table discussion, where we talk about what we did and didn’t like at the 2017 SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie).
