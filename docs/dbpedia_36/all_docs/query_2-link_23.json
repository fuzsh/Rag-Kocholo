        "text": "Jim Challenges You to Think Bigger!\n\nJim Roman is a wonderful human being and fantastic speaker and business coach. He has great spirit and energy and is a joy to be around. Jim challenges you to think bigger, not just in your business but in all areas of your life: personal, family, spiritual, financial and business. My favorite story about Jim: We were at the same networking event with about 50 people, and Jim walks up to me and says, “Give me three things you are grateful for.” Ever since then, I wake up every morning and write down three things I am grateful for.\n\n- Jeff Singletary | Realtor, GRI, Keller Williams Heritage Realty\n\nMy Business Can Thrive for the Next 100 Years!\n\nFlourishing in business has always been one of my deepest desires, but in the past it was very challenging to understand how to grow a business. Now, because I’ve worked with Jim Roman, I can confidently say I have the right systems and processes in place to thrive in business for the next 100 years—which is what every business owner truly desires. Business is no longer a challenge in my life, and working with Jim and his team has become one of my greatest victories. Jim will make you say “bye-bye” to your 9 to 5 lifestyle for good. He will walk with you on your journey to financial freedom so you can fulfill your genuine passions for a lifetime.\n\n- Dre Richmond | Founder, DBA Marketing Pros\n\nI’ve Exceeded My Goals for the Entire Year!\n\nFrom the day I started my business, I consistently struggled to meet my financial goals. But after only three months working with Jim Roman, I exceeded my sales goals for the entire year—before Q4 even started! If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that there is so much more to running a business than just getting the work done. Jim and his team have helped me improve all areas of my business, from bringing in new business, to hiring, training and developing my team. For the first time, I feel like all the hard work I’ve put into my business is finally coming together in the way I always dreamed it could.\n\n- Mike Jenkins | President, BrickTech IT\n\nGrab Onto Success in a Shorter Time Period\n\nWorking with the right coach is a vital step to fulfilling your business purpose and personal goals. Jim helped me formulate actionable goals, held me accountable, and challenged me to view things in ways I wouldn’t have seen on my own. He and his team are amazing for helping sole proprietors, coaches and small businesses grab onto success in a shorter time period than ever dreamt before! I am so thankful for the growth and success I have realized because of Jim. If you are looking for the right guidance, thoughtful insight, accountability and a plan that will work¸ you will find the right place and the right person with Jim.\n\n- Kristi Nowrouzi | Loan Officer/Branch Manager, Certified Mortgage Planners\n\nJim Truly Cares About Me and My Company\n\nJim has the ability to bring a new and unique perspective to the majority of the challenges that I have consulted with him on. It is evident that he truly cares about me and my company based on the fact that he offers more than short-term, \"quick fix\" solutions. His coaching has really helped hold me more accountable to myself so far as my professional and personal goals.\n\n- Bruce Tibbetts | President, EMC Mechanical Services\n\nAn Integral Part of My Success\n\nJim and I have worked together to build a solid foundation for my business. His coaching has been an integral part of my success in my business as he provides an outside perspective that challenges me. I came from a corporate background and wanted to pursue my own business, but I quickly realized that, even with a graduate degree, I didn’t know what I didn’t know about running and managing a small business. Jim has helped me focus my efforts on those critical elements that have made my business successful while increasing my confidence as a business owner. Jim really knows how to drill down to the basics, in particular the foundational aspects of helping business owners break down their business into more manageable pieces, keeping them focused and on track to reaching goals. He is an excellent coach, trainer and mentor.\n\n- Michele Deane | MBA, Owner, Handyman Matters\n\nOne of the Best Speakers and Trainers\n\nJim is one of the best speakers and trainers I have ever seen or heard, and I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the best in financial services over the years. Jim was instrumental in advising me to sell my interest in my former firm and start Financial Freedom Planners. He is very excited about and believes in our vision and mission. He is very smart, extremely dynamic and knows what I do for a living. In addition, he is an expert at networking, developing effective referral partners and relationships. Jim’s advice and counsel have had immeasurable value to me and my startup, especially when I lost momentum at one point.\n\n- Charles Roberts | CFP, President and CEO, Financial Freedom Planners, LLC\n\nJim Made Me Brave Enough\n\nI was brave enough to build my house at the lake because Jim helped me envision what my life would be like one day, and I wanted it, so I moved to that goal. At one of his Boot Camps I attended, Jim gave us pins saying, “Leading the Way”; helped me realize what a responsibility each of us have as leaders of our companies. We are providing a living for ourselves, our families and our coworkers. The Boot Camp was exactly what I needed to get me back on track, to movitate me and to get me to focus on moving the company forward. He even talked to me about how to build my business to sell it one day if I wanted—and I have sold the business!!! I have had other mentors in my life, but since my dad died I have had no other mentor like Jim. I am always grateful to him.\n\n- Lorrie Gore | President, Gundlack Plumbing, Cooling and Electric Co.\n\nI Have a Life for the First Time in 18 Years!\n\nI hired Jim Roman to be my coach for my business. I not only hired the best coach but also received a staff of coaches to help me with everything from understanding my numbers, improving my marketing and, most of all, putting together the best team to run my business. The business is doing so well, and I have a personal life for the first time in 18 years. I can’t put into words how thankful I am to Jim and his team. Without them, I would still be coming to work stressed every morning. Instead, our firm is winning, my family is saving for a trip to Germany, and I’m feeling great about the future.\n\n- Trish Ferrier | President, First Class Realty, Inc."
