        "text": "If the time delay method is fine for the application then go for it as it surely requires less work.\n\nHowever i'm only trying to find an alternative solution, purely for the sake of it.\n\nSo to keep on building on top of HawkME remarks :\n\nQuote\n\nTricking it is not necessary. Just disable the brake timer and it will never go idle. That wouldn't help with an actual servo off event.\n\nI was starting with the assumption that the brakes were disabled.\n\nA servo off event happens when there is an estop, fence stop, collision, or program end, etc\n\nOf course this will not prevent the servo from powering off in the event of an estop, errors and such, that is much certain since these mechanism exist precisely for that purpose. However my understanding of the application is only to prevent them from being off between motions.\n\nThus that is where having something to keep the robot busy comes in, no need to stop the program then. Just go back and forth between following the streamed path and the \"do not let the robot stop\" routine.\n\nHello people,\n\nI've been trying to connect a KOWA SC130EF2 camera to a R30iB Mate plus controller.\n\nEverything seems to be plugged correctly, yet every time i try to get the video feed i get a \"CVIS-722 - The camera specified cannot be found\".\n\nSince I'm not used to this camera and controller model, i might have forgotten something but i cannot seems to find what.\n\nCan anyone help me with that please ?\n\nThank you"
