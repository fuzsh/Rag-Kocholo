        "text": "If you're planning to buy a luxury watch, there's a huge pool of manufacturers, brands, and models to chose from. The watch you ultimately opt for depends on various factors: The timepiece's design, history, and quality of workmanship are just as important as its technology, price, value retention, and prestige. You'll also need to think about whether you would like a new model or a vintage watch. The material shouldn't be overlooked either – maybe you're interested in stainless steel, gold, or something modern like ceramic or carbon? Chrono24 is the world's leading marketplace for luxury watches and has over 500,000 watches from all the big players. Find your favorite watch and buy it securely from one of our professional dealers or private sellers.\n\nThe top watch brands worldwide include:\n\nRolex\n\nPatek Philippe\n\nBreitling\n\nOmega\n\nAudemars Piguet\n\nIWC Schaffhausen\n\nHublot\n\nPanerai\n\nGrand Seiko\n\nTAG Heuer\n\nThe best and most popular luxury watches come from the industry heavyweights. Unsurprisingly, the number one position is held by Rolex. Watches from this Swiss manufacturer are considered status symbols, and are even a household name outside of watch circles.\n\nNo other name represents watchmaking tradition, history, and skill like Patek Philippe. The manufacturer has belonged to the elite of the watch industry for more than 180 years. Timepieces from Patek boast flawless workmanship, elaborate in-house calibers, and understated designs.\n\nOne of the fledgling manufacturers that has quickly risen to fame is Richard Mille. The hallmarks of their exclusive watches are sophisticated materials, high-tech calibers, and a distinct design language. The brand's reputation has also been boosted by the fact that celebrities such as Rafael Nadal, Jay-Z, Ed Sheeran, and Kevin Hart are dedicated fans.\n\nPopular Luxury Watch Brands for Men\n\nMen's watches account for the bulk of watches on the market. Here are some examples of brands that are particularly popular with men:\n\nBreitling: Breitling is a traditional Swiss watch manufacturer. The brand is mostly known for its pilot's watches like the Chronomat and Navitimer.\n\nPanerai: This Italian watchmaker is renowned for producing watches with large dimensions. Their creations were reserved for the Italian Navy for many years, but eventually came into the limelight on the wrists of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nHublot: Hublot offer luxury watches with an obvious masculine flair. The brand holds a prestigious place in the world of soccer as the official timekeeper for major fixtures in the FIFA and UEFA championships, as well as for the World Cup and Champions League.\n\nPopular Luxury Watches for Women\n\nWomen's luxury watches are usually smaller than those intended for men. They are also often decorated with diamonds. Some of the experts in women's watches include:\n\nCartier: This French luxury watchmaker and jeweler has a rich history in the world of watchmaking. Classics like the Tank, Panthère, and Ballon Bleu have been fashionable models among the rich and famous for decades.\n\nChopard: Chopard's creations glisten with gemstones. The Happy Diamonds model is particularly popular and features diamonds floating freely around its dial.\n\nBulgari: Bulgari masterfully houses Swiss watchmaking in Italian designs. The Bulgari Bulgari collection and the Serpenti series, which resembles a snake, are the brand's best-selling women's watches.\n\nSwitzerland is undoubtedly the epicenter of the watchmaking industry. Be it mechanical automatic watches or quartz-driven timepieces, nowhere else in the world has a greater density of watch manufacturers. The western part of the country has a particularly high population of luxury watch brands, and numerous industry suppliers and movement manufacturers, such as ETA and Sellita, are also based there.\n\nThe oldest Swiss luxury watchmakers include Breguet, Vacheron Constantin, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet. These manufacturers are synonymous with traditional methods, premium quality, and superior craftsmanship. The timepieces from these industry greats often contain elaborate calibers with complications such as perpetual calendars, tourbillons, and chiming mechanisms. Their portfolios are chock full of watches crafted from precious metals such as gold and platinum, and are regularly decorated with ornate engravings or gemstones.\n\nRolex, Breitling, and Omega offer watches with sportier designs. Rolex in particular has shaped the sporty luxury watch segment with models like the Submariner, Daytona, and GMT-Master. Omega, on the other hand, sent the first wristwatch to the Moon with the Speedmaster Professional. When it comes to pilot's watches, Breitling, IWC Schaffhausen, and Fortis are the first choice for many watch enthusiasts. Racing chronographs, on the other hand, are right at home at TAG Heuer and Zenith.\n\nIn addition to the wealth of time-honored brands, Switzerland is also home to a number of young watch manufacturers that are breathing fresh air into the sometimes stuffy industry. Brands such as Urwerk, Greubel Forsey, and MB&F ensure enthusiasts are provided with futuristic designs, new material combinations, and cutting-edge technology.\n\nDiscover Swiss watches on Chrono24!\n\nThe top-10 Swiss watch brands include:\n\nRolex\n\nOmega\n\nBreitling\n\nPatek Philippe\n\nTAG Heuer\n\nTudor\n\nAudemars Piguet\n\nHublot\n\nLongines\n\nIWC Schaffhausen\n\nGermany has been manufacturing watches since the mid-18th century, with notable watchmaking hubs located in Pforzheim, the Black Forest region, and Glashütte in Saxony. Ferdinand Adolf Lange and Karl Moritz Großmann transformed the Ore Mountains' struggling mining settlement into a renowned watchmaking center. Their efforts have had a long-lasting effect, as Glashütte is still known as a seat of exceptional watchmaking craftsmanship to this day.\n\nThe town's best-known brands include A. Lange & Söhne, Nomos, Glashütte Original, Union Glashütte, and Mühle Glashütte. While A. Lange and Glashütte Original specialize mainly in complicated and richly decorated timepieces, the Union and Mühle catalogs include sportier watches and tool watches. Nomos, on the other hand, is known for their Bauhaus-inspired watches.\n\nThe Black Forest region is where well-known brands such as Laco and Stowa hail from, both of which are widely acknowledged for their pilot's and marine watches. Another important name is Junghans, which has several particularly successful Bauhaus collections, the Max Bill and Form. Junghans is one of the world's leading manufacturers of radio-controlled watches.\n\nDiscover German watches on Chrono24!\n\nThe top-10 German watch brands include:\n\nA. Lange & Söhne\n\nSinn Spezialuhren\n\nNomos Glashütte\n\nStowa\n\nJunghans\n\nGlashütte Original\n\nMeistersinger\n\nLaco\n\nMühle Glashütte\n\nMoritz Grossmann\n\nJapan is another important location in the watchmaking sphere. Kintaro Hattori, a young watchmaker, set up a small shop in Tokyo, which eventually grew into the celebrated watch company Seiko. Manufacturers like Orient Watches and Citizen can likewise trace their origins back to the early 20th century. Citizen, in particular, has achieved great success by offering watches with automatic and quartz movements under the Miyota name. Another prominent player since the 1970s is Casio, an electronics company renowned for its quartz sports watches, notably the popular G-Shock series.\n\nSeiko has by far the widest selection of all the Japanese manufacturers. Their portfolio ranges from affordable automatic watches in the Seiko 5 series to professional tool watches in the Prospex collection. Under the Grand Seiko and Credor brands, the manufacturer sells watches that rub shoulders with the best the watch industry has to offer in terms of workmanship and precision. Seiko also has a reputation as an innovator; they are credited with creating the world's first quartz watch. The Spring Drive is another invention that put the company, and Japanese watchmaking as a whole, on the map. Seiko is one of the few watch manufacturers to produce all their watch parts independently, putting the Japanese company on a par with industry leader Rolex.\n\nDiscover Japanese watches on Chrono24!\n\nThe top Japanese watch brands include:\n\nSeiko\n\nGrand Seiko\n\nCitizen\n\nOrient\n\nCasio\n\nCredor"
