        "text": "CIML is honored to support AFM-Téléthon in an innovative project\n\nThe CIML is proud to announce its collaboration and partnership with AFM-Téléthon and its President, Mrs. Laurence TIENNOT-HERMENT, for the realization of an exceptional project: the construction of a unique building in the heart of Paris. This new facility aims to centralize all Telethon research teams, providing an unprecedented space for collaboration and innovation.\n\nThis initiative marks a significant step in the fight against rare and neuromuscular diseases. By bringing together the best researchers and the most advanced technologies under one roof, AFM-Téléthon hope to accelerate scientific discoveries and improve treatments for patients.\n\nCIML looks forward to this promising collaboration and is committed to providing full support to make this project a resounding success.\n\nThe Master's degree in Immunology awarded the A*Midex “Multilingualism: courses delivered in a foreign language”, Academy of Excellence programme 2021-2024.\n\nThe CIML is pleased to announce that the second year of the Master's in Immunology is reaching a new milestone in its international influence thanks to the A*Midex \"Multilingualism\" funding led by Béatrice Nal-Rogier, Associate Professor at AMU at CIML, with the support of Giovanna Chimini, DR CNRS at CIML.\n\nStarting in the fall of 2024, the M2 Immunology program will be taught in English, allowing for the involvement of international experts in teaching and attracting English-speaking international students. Privileged partnerships with European universities, particularly with the CIVIS Alliance universities, will be strengthened to promote both incoming and outgoing student mobility.\n\nFunding of €91,921 is provided by A*Midex for the transformation of the M2 Immunology program, supplemented by the active participation of ICI, AMU, and ERASMUS for a total budget of €161,821.\n\nThe unsuspected diversity of killer cells in our immune system revealed.\n\nA major discovery has been made at the Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille Luminy, CNRS, Inserm Aix Marseille Université, in Professor Eric Vivier's team, which has just been published in the internationally renowned journal Nature Immunology. The objective of this project is to propose a mapping of a type of white blood cells that play a crucial role in our immune system, Natural Killer (NK) cells. This study, conducted on patient samples, is essential for both fundamental research and clinical applications. This project is an exceptional collaboration between twenty major laboratories in the field. They are working together to map the characteristics of NK cells using advanced protein and gene data. Their research has identified three major types of NK cells, called NK1, NK2, and NK3. Each type has specific molecular characteristics and biological functions. These findings show that NK cells vary greatly depending on tissues and diseases. This helps to better understand their role in the immune system and tumor response. These studies have also contributed to identifying 2 distinct developmental pathways of NK subpopulations, a question that had remained a mystery for years.To make this data accessible, they have developed a simple and reliable classification system, available on a web portal. This will help researchers and doctors accurately identify NK cells in various biological samples."
