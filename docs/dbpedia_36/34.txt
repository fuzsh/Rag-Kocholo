BTW I've read all the stories about Laurent Ferrier (the man) and his previous life racing at Le Mans and his 35+ years at Patek Philippe. I'm looking for information about the company & the watches.

IMHO, somewhat similar to the H. Moser brand in terms of designs. Elegant and classy.

Good looking watch.

Good luck with your research.

I can't find much either. They're known to the people in that sort of sphere, and are indeed capable of making a high quality, very well finished watch. But at the same time, they're like most independents: they don't have much of a story, they make pretty things, and they're pretty expensive. If I could, maybe I'd get one, but my tastes take me elsewhere. Mosso's done some good reviews on the Watchbox Reviews channel insofar as the details are concerned. If you want the straight-up takes, he'll probably deliver them. That said, it's hard to know much more about them. If you ever happen to be in Geneva, they offer tours according to their FAQ.

The pedigree is great, the pieces are great and Laurent Ferrier seems to be friends with all the right people.

A tour of their operations would be fantastic but requires a 10 hour flight to Geneva! 😢

I cannot help you, either. But their Bridge One is stunning!

AHCI - My love affair with LF is slowly waning

Watchprosite- Just after I posted a picture of this watch all of a sudden I noticed it there’s a piece missing in front of the crown. On top of that it still makes a cli

I would recommend searching "Laurent Ferrier" on the youtube channels "Watchbox Reviews" and "Watchbox Studios". Lot's of great video and information. In general, if you are going to get one, I would opt for at least the micro-rotor, as the models below the micro-rotor seem to lack in the same great finishing.

I have the 2020 Wrist Watch Annual and it gives a bit of the back story, but nothing more than has already been mentioned here. Lovely and elegant watches With understated designs.

They seem under appreciated.

That’s my thinking too. Everyone rushes to buy Patek or Audemars, meanwhile LF and others fly under the radar. But to each his own…

If you already read about his time at Patek and then going out to start his own company, I am not sure what else you want to know. If it is watch specific, then the articles you call "fluff pieces" are pretty much where you are going to get details of what went into designing the specific models and they should also provide details of the watches specifications.

Watch designs are not flashy and mostly go under the radar with most people that are not in the know. I own 3 pieces (a Classic Micro-Rotor, a Traveller and a Sport Auto) and I get compliments all the time but it's not like people say.....love your LF.....they will typically say that is a gorgeous watch who makes it or something like that. The brand did sort of "fly under the radar" for a while but people that are interested in higher-end independents certainly know about it. The recently introduced Sport Auto has a +3 year long waitlist last time I heard so it certainly is no longer an under the radar.

Honestly the best way for you to research the brand is to go to an AD and try one on to experience the understated elegance of the watches. The dials and the movements are stunning.

One final questions - whtat's the process for servicing a watch like LF assuming the comany isn't around any longer? I'm not suggesting LF is going out of business (and I hope it never does!), but with smaller independens there's always the risk that things turn south. I guess this question is more aplicable to microbrands in general, not just LF.

This is a risk you are always going to take when you buy from a smaller independent brand. More than likely if a brand like LF fails under the current owners it will be taken over by someone else. There are just too many brands that are in a similar situation that this could happen to that sell great timepieces that I wouldn't want to pass on thinking about it......like FPJ, Grönefeld, Romain Gauthier, Moser, Czapek, even Voutilainen, etc., etc., etc. Overall I think most pieces should be able to be serviced later by a qualified watchmaker.

@pmw_jr Where are you located? Did you check the AD listing to see if there is one near you? Watchbox and European Watch will sometimes also have a couple of preowned pieces in stock.

I’ll check it out.

Agree with @christianj - If you own ANY of the smaller boutique brands, it just makes sense to make friends with your local watchmaker. Especially once they are out of warrantee.

Yes but these days your typical "local watchmaker" is going to be able to clean and lubricate a movement and if necessary, swap out some off the shelf parts. But if pieces such as this actually have fully custom movements then good luck find a true watchmaker who would be able to create parts from scratch if needed. To use a car analogy, if all you ever need are oil changes and new tires, you are good, but if a piston cracks you will be in for some pain.

I’m only familiar with the manufacturer because Clyde from the Archieverse got one. It looks nice but I personally wouldn’t consider it. I’d go Patek, AP or JLC for a dress timepiece.

Too much talk about the risk of going independent guys. I’d much rather look at the upside. These are watches that you buy when you want something else than the ubiquitous Rolex, or certain Patek and AP that you see on Instagram all the time. LF pieces are very refined and restrained but at the same time a lot more sensual and romantic than, say, a Lange. They’re not for everyone, but I happen to like them - a lot. I recently bought my first LF (a manual wound Classic Origin, which can be considered the gateway into LF) and have been suitably impressed so far.

I agree! I buy what I like and there is always a slight consideration of the stability of the brand when buying independent however that is not my main focus. Glad to hear you are enjoying your first LF!

I absolutely love this brand. I only have one of their watches - one of the Revolution LEs, but maybe someday I will be able to add another (sport auto, down the line, perhaps? Or the classic origin with degradé blue dial?).

LF is somewhat of a family business. His son, Christian, designs the movements. The movements are designed in house, but the components are made by La Fabrique du Temps, where Christian Ferrier used to work.Fabrique du Temps is owned by LVMH so I down the line I don’t think parts or repair will be an issue.

Back to the watches….I don’t know what it is about them, but I think all of their watches are incredibly beautiful. The shapes of the cases are very elegant and smooth….kind of like a pebble that has been smoothed over by years in the ocean. The hands are absolutely gorgeous. They are just incredibly well done. The minute hand gets so thin at the center and is perfectly polished and rounded. There is an overall timeless elegance about them, and the closer you look, the more impressed you are. And the finishing on the movement is just insane. Anglage a mile wide, black polish components, inner angles, etc. The fact that the micro rotor uses a natural escapement which is done almost nowhere else is also really cool for the escapement/movement nerds among us.

Anyways I will end this post with paraphrasing something i heard a year or two ago on a watchbox podcast, the trading desk. Josh was saying that he sold a collector a LF who said that after buying that, it made his other holy trinity watches look like tissots - which I found amusing.

I have so much love for LF, though he doesn't think very highly of AR coating on his watches – they're damn-near impossible to photograph or view under anything but perfect lighting conditions.

Spectacular movements, and very organic, beautifully designed cases too. Would love to own one someday.

I am surprised that LF did not go out of business during COVID like some other Independents. They seem to have trouble with leadership. Going through 4 different CEOs in the past 6 - 7 years is not a good look. In addition, the lesser known accusation that their micro rotor movement was not designed in-house. LF apparently source third party movement maker to design the mircro rotor movement for them. There are other examples of many other watch company with very similar micro rotor movement.

While I love their Galet Square and pebble design, i feel that their prices are not worth what they are asking, even in the preowned space.

Getting off topic, but which ones went out of business?

Romain Jerome and HYT are the ones that comes to mind.

There are more but here is article with some brands that are gone.

In Memoriam: People And Brands Who Left Us In 2020 - Quill & Pad

The Latin phrase “in memoriam” is often used in place of “in memory of.” And to my mind, people also use it to signify departed who may be gone but shouldn’t be forgotten. Every year people working in the watch industry pass away, and brands come and go. Elizabeth Doerr highlights a special few...

I say a used Origin at <30k is much better value than a 6119.

I would agree LF is a better buy than the 6119 right now.. However, I believe that 6119 will continue to drop in price.

I can get a Patek World timer 5230 or A. Lange & Sohne Lange one moonphase at 30k and that would be a better buy. Which leads me to my point that LF preowned at 30k is a hard bargain especially when you are up against such a stable and well know companies like Patek, Vacheron, ALS, ect. that offer more in terms of function.

I'm considering LF as well but the two-piece crown mentioned in the post shared by GrouchoM is quite concerning, off-putting even. Can someone expand on if I should worry about that?

Not sure one report should make you question their quality. Ive had no issues with the three I own.

To me, LF occupies a weird spot.

They stop shy of excellent quality finishing, and don’t really offer anything too unique. Not compelling enough to go independent…

Someone in a similar price bracket is Armin Strom. A watch like their mirrored force resonance model is way more interesting. A truly unique complication, higher quality finishing, customization, etc.

LF are a lot less used btw. Do not buy new! Let someone else eat the depreciation for you.
