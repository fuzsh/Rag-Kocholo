We all have our favourite independents and our own views on who are the best among them but this is my top five which I am sure will not necessarily be agreed upon by everyone. I have decided to attach some photos to highlight why I think these independents are the best of the best!

And in no particular order, the affable and humble Kari Voutilainen, the king of finishing Philip Dufour, the visionary Romain Gauthier, the traditional Roger Smith and the master watchmaker and designer, FP Journe! I was tempted to add Laurent Ferrier to the list too instead of FP Journe but FP has been an iconic figure for over a decade and his collection is arguably more varied.

Let me know what you think

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all!

Best wishes,

Sham

PS Needless to say none of the lovely photos below were taken by me!
