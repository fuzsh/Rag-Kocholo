        "text": "Today I’m going to introduce to you a soft, nostalgic song by a Chinese band, Sodagreen.\n\nThe gentle piano melody in the introduction serves as a door, slowly opening the rapid emotional rise and falls of the song as the guitars and drums come in, indicating a high tide. Then the melody quiets down again when the vocal comes in. Throughout the song, the instrumentals layer from time to time to describe the emotion of the song.\n\nWhat’s great about this song is that though the two verses and the two choruses are exactly the same in lyrics, the vocal, Qingfeng Wu, illustrates them into two different states of emotion with his voice.\n\nIn the first verse, Qingfeng Wu almost whispers the lyrics as if talking to himself. His voice shivering, like he can’t accept the fact that he’s aging, he’s lonely, and he can’t get over the “You” he is missing.\n\nDuring the first chorus, Qingfeng Wu sounds careful and withdrawn, as his high notes are tender and slim. Till this point Qingfeng Wu presents a state in which he is silent by himself, feeling the loneliness and nostalgia by himself, but not able to shout his depression out.\n\nIn the second verse, Qingfeng Wu’s voice becomes much more stable. Singing the same lines, he now sighs (given that he now accepts it) about his loneliness, his life, those lost happiness and those memories that can’t come back. Just right before the second chorus, Qingfeng Wu sings the last word of the verse with a strong, penetrating note, pushing the emotion to climax.\n\nThen in the following chorus Qingfeng Wu pours all his previously depressed feelings out. He no longer holds back, and he cries to everyone out there – if there is anyone out there in this song, telling them his sadness and nostalgia. His strong voice is almost like tears, flowing out ceaselessly. He cries and repeats “I miss you, I miss you”, but each time is delicately different from one another in emotion. In the end Qingfeng Wu goes back to a tender, shivering voice, showing an inner expression of “even though I miss you so much, there is nothing else I can do”.\n\nThen the instruments come in loudly without much change from before, as if “burying” Qingfeng Wu’s emotion, suggesting the irreversible present despite of all kinds nostalgia and loneliness Qingfeng Wu holds – there is truly nothing he could do, to go back in time.\n\nTo me, there is a controversy about identity of the “you” in the song. Though many people may think this “you” to be, apparently, a lover long gone, I have another illustration. Throughout the song there is no specific description about the “you”, nor there’s any sign of the relationship between “you” and “me” – not even a mention of the time when “we were together”. All the song sings about is how life past so fast, we are lonely by ourselves, we lose our dreams and faiths as we grow old, and there is no more happiness like in memories. To me, instead of a lover long gone, the “you” in the song is “me” himself, the younger “me” who still holds faith and dream, who is still too young to feel loneliness by himself. That’s why the lyrics say “I miss you, but I can’t do anything; I miss you but I can only keep it to myself”. Only “me” himself can understand, the past “self”, being naïve but carefree, young but happy, that he had lost over time.\n\nThis song, 我好想你 (I Miss You), is also the theme song of a Chinese movie: Tiny Times. Tiny Times talks about the lives and struggles of the several youths in big Shanghai. It’s a good story 🙂\n\nFollowing is the music video of 我好想你 (I Miss You), movie-themed version.\n\n——————————\n\n*All rights related to the picture and the song reserved to rightful owners. All rights related to the writing reserved to Asian Music Invasion.\n\nAs it probably seems obvious, there are lots of Asian songs sung in English. Lots of people whine about how these songs sound “American-wanna-be”, how bad the lyrics are, and how funny pronunciations sound… However, there are some good ones that are great for people to start their Asian music journey with. This time, I am introducing a song by Anthony Neely (a Taiwanese singer): “Wake Up”.\n\nThe experience may vary from people to people, but “Wake Up” gave me a great listening experience. The rhythm is crisp and light, yet it’s strong and catchy at the same time, which made me start tapping my feet within the song’s first verse. The melody is simple and lighthearted, which makes it easy for listeners to sing along. What really impresses me is the lyrics – it actually makes perfect sense, and it has a pretty deep meaning to it; it’s not some combination of nonsense words, it’s not some easy lines for a love song. Some lines are inspiring, such as “If you want the truth, (then) go out and get it cuz it won’t find you.”\n\nThe MV, on the other side, is colored and filmed with a vintage and funky feeling to it, and a chain of symbolic meanings are laid throughout the MV in the scattered scenes, tying the MV back to the meaning of the song. In the beginning we see a man (who is acted out by Anthony Neely, of course) dressed up in suits, sitting up in a sofa, scared and looking around. This represents the muddle-headed state that the man – who himself is a symbol of the majority of the people in the world – is in: compared to finding who he truly is and what he truly wants, he would rather stay inside the box, do whatever everyone else is doing, and keep it that way. That’s why he is so scared when the “alarm clock” of his life rings – he’s afraid of stepping out. In addition, the modern and materialistic elements such as the suit, the luxurious watch and the car all reveal the sophistication and disillusion of the society, further emphasizing the conforming life of the man.\n\nThen the crazy scary clown comes in. The clown looks scary as he is holding a hammer, but indeed the clown represents the inside dream and the true self of the man, trying to chase the muddle-headed body and wake him up (or crush the muddle inside the man’s head using the hammer). The clown is portrayed in a funky and almost frightening way because to the man, or say, to we ourselves (the audiences), realizing the fact that “we are not awake to ourselves” is frightening. We ourselves are scared of realizing who we are, we ourselves are so used to the mode we live in that we are scared of breaking out of it and find our true selves, hence we see the clown as evil and frightening. The same technique is used on the muse park: the muse park looks creepy, but in deed it is the forgotten dream, the true desire, and the innocence and happiness of the man.\n\nThroughout the MV, the man struggles with himself. He tries to escape from his true self, but at the same time he is yelling from the inside, struggling with the “water of messed-up life”, trying to wake up. In the end, he finally takes the courage to convert himself into one of the clowns, smashes the alarm clock, and welcomes his awakening. Here it’s also sarcastic because as the man smashes the alarm clock, he looks insane – but is he really insane? No, he just looks insane in the eyes of us, or the eyes of people who still curl up inside the tiny “box” and are afraid to step out – they are scared of this “ridiculous and wrongful” act of finding true self and awakening. At the very end of the MV, the man who already turned into a free clown and the other clowns give a mysterious laugh and wave at the audience, as if asking us:”Are you going to join us? Are you going to ‘wake up’, or are you just going to stay as a muddle-headed conformist in life?” The heavily sarcastic, symbolic and even frightening MV combines with the lighthearted and carefree melody and creates a funky clash.\n\nOverall, from the music, the lyrics of the song, to the costume and the styling of Anthony Neely, the setting and the storyboard of the MV, “Wake Up” exhibited a funky American style that almost fooled me into believing that it’s an American song until I felt the Chinese-pop integration in the details of the song. Take the lyrics for instance, some parts of a word are repeated like “what you do-do-do-do”, “love-love” and “won’t-won’t find you”, and that is something heard often in Chinese pop (actually, all Asian pop). Also, the underscore at the bridge and some of the drum transitions are pretty typical in Chinese pop as well. And of course, some lines are sang in Chinese.\n\nAnother notable point of “Wake Up” is that Anthony Neely wrote the the lyrics himself and took part in the composition of the song. Yes, he is biracial – in fact, it’s probably this special culture combination that he grew up with that made the American funkiness of this song. What’s more, Anthony Neely always takes some responsibility in all of his songs. As a young, talented, and even good looking artist, I personally think Anthony Neely deserves more attention and value.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nCheck out some other good songs by Anthony Neely:\n\n“Nightmare”: this is a song resembles the story of Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll laments how he can’t even see himself anymore, leaving only Hyde, the dark side of him, living in this world.\n\n. . .\n\n“Awakening”: this is a song as a response to the rumored “the end of the world in 2012”. The world still exists, the morning still comes, so what are you worrying about, what are you waiting for?\n\n. . .\n\n“HELP/ Save Life”: Only you can save your own life. If you don’t let go yourself, no matter how hard you cry for help, nobody is going to save you from the hell of your mental illness.\n\n(English translation of the lyrics can be found here.)\n\n————————————\n\n*All pictures come from snapshots I took from the MV of “Wake Up” and the Internet.

By starting with a catchy and echoing chant, the song reaches an epic effect almost instantaneously without needing any emotional buildup, giving the song a mysterious and alien atmosphere as if it’s from an unknown culture, which in turn ties back to the theme and concept of EXO: twin legends from EXO-planet. What’s more, while the underscore stays epic and almost like classical, the main melody of the song pulls “MAMA” back to a perfectly Korean pop song – the overall sound of the song didn’t become too heavy, too classical, or too alternative; the overall style of the song still fits EXO’s profile as a K-pop boy group. Also, since the overall feeling to the song is already epic, composing an appropriate bridge that keeps up with the rest of the song AND stands out from the rest of the epic melody becomes a challenge – it could easily get blended in, or just ruin the vibe. But the producer of “MAMA” made it. Though some fans whine about the scary and metal-like bridge with the screaming and shouting, to me it is the perfect choice. It definitely pushes the already-heated song up even more, and the shouting, mumbling and metallic instrumental definitely distinguished the bridge from the rest of the song. In my opinion, “MAMA” is probably one of the best produced fast-paced pop song SM had produced in recent years in terms of music quality, and this level of music quality is what SM should really pursue more often instead of those cheap and easily-addictive ones.\n\nHowever, the grandiose sound quality of “MAMA” does not save it from the terrible English lyrics. Let’s look at the lyrics for the epic chants that lots of people, including me of course, thought would be in Latin at first:\n\n“Careless, careless. Shoot anonymous, anonymous. Heartless, mindless; no one, who care about me.”\n\nThough I have been trying to look objective in my reviews, and I understand that SM is trying to make something poetic and artistic, I have to tell you this: I almost fell off from my chair and died from high-blood pressure resulted from anger when I first realize what the members are singing at the chants. It felt like being told that the extremely and unbelievably delicious dish I ate is actually made of animal excrement. Anyone, even those people who need a dictionary to find out what each word in the sentences means, would KNOW that these sentences don’t make sense, IN ANY LANGUAGE. Just using purely meaningless syllables would still make it 100 times better. Just like this:\n\n“Ki A Les, Ki A Les, Shun An Nau Ni Mos, An Nau Ni Mos. Harr Te Les, My A Les, Nau Wo Du Kil Bol Mi.”\n\nAt least the chant then would sound like it’s in a cool alien language – which SM can totally justify because “EXO is from an extraterrestrial planet”! But no, SM loves showing off , and apparently ZERO person in the whole entire company knows any English. (No I was being sarcastic.) Also, SM, if you were really going to put these words together, can you at least make the only one grammar you can possibly have right? (Grammar can’t even be applied for the rest of them.) It’s “who CARES about me”, not “who CARE about me”. I wish I can find an excuse for SM, but sadly it comes clear that these terrible English phrases just resulted from the company’s lack of interest, lack of the sense of responsibility, and laziness.\n\nAnother flaw about the song is its title, “MAMA”. In Korean, “MAMA(마마)” means “queen”, or a very high-status, respected, powerful and expected-to-be-wise woman that supervises and is in control. The origin of this word can be traced all the way back to ancient Korea, and today it can also be symbolized as a queen-like woman who’s so charismatic and beautiful that she makes men kneel down for her. For sure Korean speakers and people who are familiar with Korean cultures know that “MAMA” means, but for foreigners, it can start to look weird because “MAMA” is usually explained as “mom”, “mother”. In fact, in Chinese, “MAMA” is exactly the very and only pronunciation for the word “mother (妈妈)” . Take in the fact that this song is also in Chinese, and throughout the Chinese version of it none of the original “MAMA” words are taken out or translated into Chinese words that would make better sense, “MAMA” just doesn’t seem to be a listener-friendly song to Chinese listeners. It’s also not listener-friendly to other foreign listeners, of course. Without reading the lyrics or knowing the meaning of “MAMA” in Korean, almost every Chinese listener and other foreign listener would think that “this new group of young guys is kneeling down, tearing heart out and crying for their darling mommy… and the song is talking about love relationship?! … ok this is very weird.” And that is surely not the effect SM originally intended to have.\n\nBut of course, “MAMA” is nevertheless a great pop song. The music quality of it overpowers the flaws of the lyrics and title, and the dance and the music video make it even more impressive.\n\nThe dance makes me speechless. SHINee’s latest title song “Sherlock” does have lots of creative and interesting movements, but in terms of dynamics and connection between movements, “Sherlock” appears inferior to “MAMA”. The choreography of “MAMA” is filled with complicated soft and sleek moves and punchy, strong and striking moves integrating into each other, creating a well-balanced comprehensiveness. The choreography also fully utilized the formation of a group – the formation shifts are also so well-done that it creates a subtle dynamic inside the entire team; each movement seals onto the next movement smoothly and seamlessly. The overall visual effect of the dance even reminds me of Taichi, a slow Chinese Kungfu style that focuses solely on balancing, smoothness and wholeness. Personally, I think I find my new favorite choreography after SHINee’s “Lucifer” in 2010. I again show my deep respect for SM’s choreographers.\n\nThe music video, on the other hand, gives totally another visual satisfaction – even though the plots don’t really make sense. Here, we get to know that EXO is a group of 12 different forces that are created to protect the tree of life on EXO-planet. Here is a brief list of each member’s “super power”:\n\nEXO-K:\n\nKai – Teleportation\n\nChanyeol – Flame\n\nSuho – Water\n\nD.O. – Earth\n\nBaek Hyun – Light\n\nSehun – Wind\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nEXO-M:\n\nLu Han – Telekinesis (not telepathy as the picture indicates)\n\nKris – Flight\n\nLay – Healing\n\nTao – Time Control\n\nChen – Lightening (not light, Baek Hyun has Light)\n\nXiu Min – Frost\n\nYes, it sounds a bit cheesy, but the high-budgeted special effects shown in the music video cannot be ignored. Kai disappears into thin air and then appears within one second somewhere else, Chanyeol walks leaving flames on the ground, Kris jumps off from the top of the building, Lay brings the frozen flower back to life… Chanyeol and Kris even summoned a fire phoenix and a fire dragon! Even though the music videos don’t have a clear theme other than showing off each member’s super power, nor does it connect to the theme of the song itself, SM has successfully produced a grand music video fulled with professional and realistic special effects that attracts audience.\n\nOf course, the special effects are not the only things that stand out in the music video. F or example, the scenes in the beginning and at the end in which 12 members are presented as some sort of religious figures, or maybe “gods of supernatural powers” creates an intriguing and mysterious atmosphere. As the 12 “gods of supernatural powers” gather under moonlight and slowly look up to the moon, mumbling the occult chants, the atmosphere becomes epic, which fits the feeling of the song perfectly. In addition to the special effects, these scenes also make the music video look like a mini-movie instead of just a music video, except this “mini-movie” doesn’t have a plot.\n\nAround the bridge of the song, I believe most of the audience of the music video experienced a huge shock – some of them probably got frightened – when they suddenly saw Kai (for EXO-K’s version of the song), Xiu Min and Kris (for EXO-M’s version of the song) with frightening prints painted on their faces, shouting. That is a huge breakthrough – at least for SM.SM has done fancy make-up and erratic hairstyles in TVXQ’s “Triangle” and Super Junior’s “Don’t Don”, but nobody would ever expect a scary face print on any SM entertainer, since a cute and perfect image has always been what SM uses to keep fans.So it was a great step forward. Also, the patterns are designed and drawn on artistically and professionally; it’s art, I would say. Kris’ asymmetrical pattern of a crystal is sharp and glittering; Xiu Min’s scary skull print is shaded and outlined very professionally to create a very realistic view;\n\nand if you look close, you will find that what Kai’s got on his face is not some scary skull print, but a brief introduction statement of EXO-K! I was amazed, because it is so well-designed that the overall look resembles a frightening skull pattern while all the words are still in their original shapes (none of the words were twisted to get that visual effect).\n\nEXO’s debut with “MAMA” can be considered one of the most grandiose debut ever in the entire Kpop industry so far: The debut was advertised with twenty-three teasers (that’s the most teasers I’ve ever seen for one single album or for a debut); the debut was preconditioned by two prologue songs, which each has its own music video as well; the members were softly advertised\n\nby shooting photographs for a high fashion magazine High Cut before debut; the debut song “MAMA” is delicately composed and sounds grandiose; the music video of “MAMA” is filmed with high budget for the special effects and many new ideas; the choreography of “MAMA” is also fancy and comprehensive… The efforts SM has put into EXO’s debut is unbelievable (of course, the members worked really hard too).\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nAt the end of this tremendously long and tiresome review (Sorry… and thank you so much for reading the whole thing), please allow me to comment a little bit more about SM’s fabulous marketing skills (read my other analysis here)\n\nMany people have been confused, annoyed, or even upset by how much Kai is getting the attention – he is in more than half of the teasers before the debut, he’s always in the center, he gets the most camera shots, he even gets the crazy face painting and the entire bridge of the Korean\n\nversion of MAMA… Why is SM so unfair? Let me tell you: it’s just another of their commercial skills. EXO has 12 members, and therefore it is almost impossible to make 24 teasers, giving each member 2 teasers, and expect people to remember each of them before EXO debuts – in fact, people wouldn’t even have that much an impression on EXO as a whole because there is not a center, a focal point, a point that sticks out and gets caught easily. By repeatedly giving attention to Kai alone and almost “ignoring” most of the other members, SM successfully prevented this loss of focus. By doing so, SM also established a well known name, “Kai”, which in terms gave people and the press an easy access to get to know EXO through the name of Kai. Conversations then can easily go like this:”Do you know EXO? The new group that Kai is in?” “Oh Kai? Yeah I know his name! I want to see his group! I will check it out.” What’s more, by almost ignoring most of the other members before debut, SM established a sense of mystique for EXO and triggered people to think: “How about the other members? Why did SM only focus on Kai? I want to see the whole group!” So people started doing some research about EXO, and people had the curiosity to stay tuned about EXO, and people started to talk about EXO. Like it or not, SM has allured lots of audience, listeners and fans for EXO this way.\n\nWhat’s more, SM has utilized the logo of EXO very well throughout the music video. The hexagon shaped logo is imbedded everywhere (costumes, buildings, rings…)throughout the two music videos, which visually increases the impression of the music video and the group for the audience, visually making the name EXO memorable. As far as I know, EXO is the only group from SM that has a simple and representative logo; it may be another new technique SM is experimenting on, and it surely is getting its effect as expected.\n\nOverall, SM certainly does great “conspiracies” marketing and advertising.

All rights related to the writing reserved to Asian Music Invasion.\n\nYamashita Tomohisa, a popular Japanese singer and actor (I would put him into the category of “idols”), released his new solo single “I, Texas / 愛、テキサス”.\n\nDue to copyright issues, there is no legitimate MV available on Youtube. Following is a link to a certified website which has the MV for “I, Texas” legally under copyright regulations: http://www.yinyuetai.com/video/365472\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Yamashita Tomohisa (usually called YamaPi among fans), please let me do a brief introduction of him. Yamashita joined Johnny’s Entertainment at the age of 11 and debuted as a member of a idolistic boy group, “News” and released many songs and albums both with his group and solo, such as “Loveless” and “One In A Million“. Yamashita also acted in dramas and movies, such as “Buzzer Beat”, “Kurosagi / The Black Swindler” and “Ashita No Jo / Tomorrow’s Joe (Trailer and Entire Movie both available as linked)”. In 2011, Yamashita quit the group News, and started his new journey in this industry that he’s been in for more than half of his life on his own.\n\nSo, in some way, “I, Texas” is Yamashita Tomohisa’s first real solo. As if declaring his independence from News and the previous “YamaPi”, Yamashita Tomohisa largely altered his previous R&B and pop music style (You can see the changes very easily by contrasting “I, Texas” to “Loveless” and “One In A Million”) in “I, Texas”, his new single. “I, Texas” has a very funky and strange taste to it: It sounds almost nothing like songs that idols would sing – it doesn’t sound pop, but the melody of the song – especially the underlying guitar melody – is catchy enough to fit the song into the category “pop”. It sounds country as the guitar progresses, but compared to the cozy laziness that country songs have, this song has more a feeling of wandering and wilderness. The song has a light-hearted melody, but the sense of carefree attitude didn’t sound like it came naturally – it sounded more like it came from one’s tiredness of the world’s sophistication. The instrumental is entirely built with guitars, drums and western-seasoned midi effects, and for sure no traditional Japanese instruments were utilized, however, the song overall reminds me of those small Japanese traditional restaurants in 1950 to 1960’s, when the modern world was just starting to fuse in, when the old traditions were still very well kept.\n\nMany people would sigh about how cheap the MV is produced, or how much the title “I, Texas” doesn’t make sense. Yes, the music video is indeed way too cheap – it’s such a disappointment that Yamashita Tomohisa’ first legitimate solo didn’t get more support in production. What’s more, Yamashita Tomohisa actually went on a road trip himself all the way from Chicago to Los Angeles, filming a documentary of it called “Route 66” – he indeed drove through Texas himself, with a camera guy accompanying him! Why in the world didn’t Johnny’s or Warner Music Japan just film the music video “by the way”? The whole green screen and cheesy transition in the MV just look ridiculous.\n\nHowever, my disappointment was soothed by the creativity and puns expressed by the title of the song along with the meaning of lyrics. The title “I, Texas” actually can be read in three different ways:\n\n“愛, Texas”: 愛 means “Love”, so the title becomes “Love, Texas”. No matter what this love is for: a certain girl, a certain home, or the city, the land, the Texas itself, “Love, Texas” expresses the attachment of a person to Texas, which gives nostalgic feeling to the song.\n\n“I, Texas”: This illustration of the title ties the self and Texas together, and the comma builds the meaning of “Me in Texas”, which gives a sense of loneliness: it’s just me, and Texas, and nobody, and nothing else.\n\n“Ai, Texas”: In this illustration of the title, rather than meaning any solid word like Love or Self, “Ai” represents the sound of a sigh, which turns the song into a plaint. It could be a sigh toward the land Texas, it could be a sigh toward some certain things that happened in Texas, or it could be a sigh toward life, a life that resembles the broad wilderness of Texas – bleak but vast, covered by dusts and pain yet filled with hope and potentials.\n\nOf course, the three layers of the meaning of the title of this song didn’t come from nowhere – the story is hidden behind the lyrics. The lyrics did not explicitly tell any of the cause and effect of the story – even the storyline itself remains unclear, however, the half-revealed story is enough for building the mental state of this “Me”, the main character of the story, and therefore explain where the meanings of the title comes from. What stunned me was the incredible connection between the lyrics the title and the contradicting light-hearted melody and rhythm. The subtle but great attitude toward life and the worldview this song expresses also stuns me:\n\n“Whatever happened yesterday, it won’t come back today or tomorrow – the good, the bad, the joy, the love, the crime, the punishment. Though carrying much pain, regret and sorrow, I have to face the infinite sky and the upcoming tomorrow, and go continue my journey of life. Not that I like it, but I just have to. So take it easy, though life is heavy and hard.”\n\nWow.\n\nHowever, in the end, this is just my personal read into this song. Just like the title itself can be read in 3 different ways, a song can be read in infinite different ways. Agree with me or not, I hope you can look at the lyrics and listen to the song, feel it, and develop your read into it. Only one thing is for sure: “I, Texas”, along with its funky music style, punned title and deep meaning within the song, is definitely the brand new start for Yamashita Tomohisa, for his music journey, and for his journey in life.\n\nLYRICS TRANSLATION\n\nthe biting of his nails,\n\ncasts a shadow on my memory\n\nthe sadness in these eyes\n\nis it the reflection of my sins?\n\naimlessly aimlessly swaying\n\ncheating , wandering, getting lost\n\nhis voice is echoing\n\nshooting inside my head\n\nthe deep pain of leaving is red colored\n\nbut any kind of pain is lovely\n\ndon’t you think so? in any relation\n\nif there’s hope then it’s enough\n\nthe craziness of this world\n\nleaves a gentle kiss\n\nthe dry lips’ bleeding\n\nis it my punishment?\n\nrunning, running hiding\n\nam I that coward?\n\nlaughing inside\n\nbecause you cannot kill the devil\n\nwhy is there such a thing as ending\n\nwe were only born to die\n\ndon’t let me down\n\nplease let there be some light in the cloudy weather\n\nTalk part:\n\nThat day, we were drinking tequila as always.\n\nI smiled as I heard him said he’s getting married.\n\nIf I said: “I would be the cause of your death”, I bet he would laugh.\n\nthe deep pain of leaving colored in red\n\nbut any kind of pain is lovely\n\n(I have) decide to get ready\n\nleave the past in the desert\n\nembrace that sad’s person’s mirage\n\nAi, Texas.\n\n(Credits: Rima-no-yume@LJ)\n\n——————————\n\n*Picture, videos and lyrics all come from the Internet. All rights related to them reserved to original authors.\n\nAfter almost two years of waiting, SHINee is finally back! On March 19th, SHINee released their 4th mini album – Sherlock.\n\nTrack List\n\n01. Sherlock•셜록 (Clue + Note)\n\n02. Clue\n\n03. Note\n\n04. Alarm Clock /알람시계\n\n05. The Reason\n\n06. Stranger /낯선자\n\n07. Honesty /늘 그자리에\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nSherlock is finally the one album from SHINee that I like thoroughly. Usually, SHINee’s album has a great title song with a fancy music video, then there will be 1 or 2 good songs in the album, and the rest of it just don’t stand out at all. However, for Sherlock, the ideas, the music quality, and the vibe of the entire album is amazing as each song varies from another with its own uniqueness. Let’s take a look:\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nThe title song, “Sherlock”, is a so-called hybrid remix, which mixes two independent songs, in this case, “Clue” and “Note”, into a new song. I particularly like the concept of hybrid remix since it can create amazing and surprising effects when used right, however, even though the song “Sherlock” is produced by an entirely European team, I highly doubt SM Entertainment’s motivation of making this so-called “hybrid remix”. The two supposedly independent “Clue” and “Note” sound very alike, and “Clue” lacks an obvious chorus while “Note” has a constant tension as if the whole song is at climax. In my opinion, SME probably composed “Sherlock” first, then came up with the two sub-version of it, naming them “Clue” and “Note”, and finally used the name of hybrid remix to justify the three similar songs. (SME’s money-making skills again, huh? But this is just my personal opinion.)\n\nNevertheless, Sherlock is filled with energy and playfulness. The intro is classic and funky, and the overall melody is a lot more mature than SHINee’s early works like “Juliet” and “Love Like Oxygen” and a lot more playful and more interesting than their kpop-stereotyped “Ring Ding Dong” and “Lucifer”. The instrumental is rich and filled with different kinds of machine-like “noises”, which are assigned so delicately that none of them messes up the neatness of the song; in fact, these underlying melodies and noises help build up a vintage yet modern feeling to the song.\n\nSherlock’s choreography is also notable, just like the choreography of every other SHINee’s title song. Every move has something new and eye-catching in it, and if I am going to take notes on each of them I probably won’t be able to get to the other songs in this album today. 🙂 You can check out the dance version of Sherlock here to find out how it goes. (Lucifer still has my favorite choreography though, just saying.)\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nAs I said above, “Clue” and “Note” sound pretty alike.\n\n“Clue” lacks an obvious chorus.\n\n“Note” has a constant tension as if the whole song is at climax.\n\nHowever, they are still pretty nicely seamed songs. Also, I find myself finding pleasure in distinguishing the two songs and their parts in “Sherlock”. That’s probably the key of a hybrid remix song – it makes people listen more into its components.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nI as first attracted to “Alarm Clock /알람시계” by its funky and distorted beginning. Compared to waking up, “Alarm Clock” gave me more a feeling of an erratic dream – I would never want to wake up with this feeling. The song also gives a swinging feeling as if shaking or walking on the edge. So I looked up the lyrics of “Alarm Clock”, and I was surprised at how accurate the lyrics fits the melody and the vibe of the song – it’s about a man, dumped by his girlfriend, feeling as if he’s been having an erratic long nightmare, waiting for the alarm clock (which means the girl’s love) to save him from the dream. The awkwardness of the song surprisingly makes perfect sense with the lyrics – that’s something you don’t see often in K-pop; K-pop has so many songs in which the lyrics don’t make sense, or don’t fit at all. Overall, even though the melody in “Alarm Clock” is nothing new, the awkward underlying feeling makes it unique. (Check out the lyrics here.)\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n“The Reason” starts off with a rather gloomy vibe as the electric guitar plays solo in the intro. It feels like the grey sky filled with dark clouds before a storm comes. Then the members’ clear and tender voices come in with quiet instrumental and no base at the back, as if it starts drizzling. At 0:44, as the melody rises and the midi sound effect comes into the instrumental, the emotional state of the song is quickly raised to the peak – the storm pours down, heavily brushes off the dust on roofs, leaves, roads… And finally, the sun comes out after a heavy baptism. The emotional build-up of “The Reason” makes me shrill, the melody of the song is strong and catchy, and the lyrics of this song also fits the overall feeling (check it out here).\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n“Stranger /낯선자” is the Korean version of “Stranger (Japanese version)” in SHINee’s Japanese album “The First” and is a very typical SHINee-styled pop song. Besides criticizing SME for its laziness, I don’t particularly have anything to say about this song, but I do appreciate that SME does keep SHINee’s original pop style (unlike Super Junior, their style was completely flipped inside out by SME over time). Also, I do like a part of this song a lot – the second verse (the part right before chorus, for example from 1:23 to 1:38), especially the part when the lyrics say “control” (1:29 – 1:30). It feels robotic.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n“Honesty /늘 그자리에” is my favorite song in this album “Sherlock”. It’s acoustic, it’s soft, it’s smooth, it’s sweet and subtle. If I said “The Reason” feels like a baptizing storm, then I would definitely describe “Honesty” as the scene after the rain when the sunshine leaks out from the clouds, the ground still wet, beads of dew dropping down from the tip of leaves, gentle breeze flowing through the half open window, the air filled with moist and freshness.Closing my eyes, I can even see the green, feel the breeze, breath the freshness and taste the unruffled sweetness.\n\nThe lyrics of “Honesty” is beautiful as well. You can read it here.\n\nI can say nothing more about this song without ruining it, so please enjoy it if you would.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nOverall, the music in album “Sherlock” contains more or less a feeling of jazz and blues (I really don’t view the two as the same thing. Jazz is more traditional and “easy-come-easy-go”, whereas blues is softer and with gentler emotion.) This is also why I like this album’s music – they differ from each other, yet they tie back altogether.\n\nNow that we are done with the music, let’s take a look at some other things “Sherlock” has. Despite of some French-boy-pornography-styled pictures contained in the album, “Sherlock” does have an interesting album cover. It’s not just another idolistic picture of SHINee members standing together or showing off their pretty faces, and it’s not just a patterned background with the title “SHERLOCK” on it. It is indeed artistically and carefully shot – the paint, the hands and hands only, the vintage styled fabrics and bracelets, the clash of color, the old instrument (Ukulele? I am not sure)… Every element on the album cover adds a bit of taste into the picture. As a result, this album cover really attracts people to the album – even those people who have no idea who SHINee is (for example, my cousin). That’s the power that every album cover should have.\n\nPeople also talk about Taemin’s hair. Due to obvious reasons, I am not going to comment more about Taemin’s femininity with that crazily neat and kawaii long hair. There’s no excuse for Taemin’s hair this time, SM, Taemin is no where near a rocker in this album, don’t try to fool us with the same reason you did for Lucifer. (Remember what I said about his hair in Lucifer? Click here if you haven’t read it yet.)\n\nAfter all, “Sherlock” is a pretty successful album of SHINee: from the title of the album to the album cover, and even to the music itself, “Sherlock” gives a bit of vintage taste without overdoing it or losing the SM style.\n\n———————————-\n\n* Pictures come from the Internet, including snapshots I took from the official MV of “Sherlock”. No infringement intended.\n\n* Rights regarding to the writing reserved to Asian Music Invasion.\n\nAfter releasing 23 teasers and a so-called “Prologue Single”, “What Is Love” (both Korean & Chinese versions), SM Entertainment (Korean) released another so-called “prologue single” of EXO (a new boy group that will debut some time this year): “History”.\n\nKorean Version:\n\nChinese Version:\n\nBefore I start a tremendously long article on SM Entertainment’s marketing skills, let’s take a look at the song “History” itself. Even though it was such a joy to see that EXO finally releases another song (or a prologue? I don’t know), I was extremely disappointed when I first heard the song.\n\nThe midi effects and beats (0:15 – 0:22) sound like that of Super Junior’s “Don’t Don”; the chorus (0:45 – 0:50) sounds like that of TVXQ’s “Keep Your Head Down”; the second verse at the line “No more shakin’ like that” (1:19 – 1:20) sounds like the chorus at SHINee’s “Amigo”; the bridge at 2:30 is almost identical with the bridge of TVXQ’s “Are You a Good Girl”; the third quarter of the bridge (2:30 – 2:53) sound almost exactly like the bridge for Super Junior’s “Don’t Don” from 2:56 to 3:27 with the rapping part and the melody part reversed. Except for the members’ great skills at dancing and singing, their great looks, and the absolutely new choreography with hands shivering in pants, “History” sounded like a mix of SM’s song history to me. Yes, TVXQ, Super Junior, SHInee, and EXO all come from SM Entertainment (SME), but this should not be the excuse of SM producers plagiarizing their music for other groups and not giving EXO a unique music style.\n\nHowever, “History” does have some new elements that may define EXO’s music style later on. The midi effect in the intro is light, twisted, and funky – this feeling was in EXO’s first “prologue song” “What Is Love” as well. Even though I don’t feel too much love for it, it is definitely something the previous SM groups never had. Secondly,\n\nthe booming beats (0:11 – 0:15 ) are so catchy and exciting that it increases the power level of the song. With the cool “shivering-your-hands-in-your-baggy-pants’-pockets” dance movements, those booming parts of the song really bring highlights to the music. The music video doesn’t have any plots – it’s made with low cost and is made purely of dance scenes and close-up shots, but this is ok, since “History” is only a “prologue single” that serves mainly to introduce members, to attract fans, and to raise the level of anticipation toward EXO’s official debut. That’s a marketing skill. No matter how the song sounds like or looks like, fans, or anyone who’s interested in EXO’s debut, would be happy to watch this MV because they have been watching 23 thirty-second long teasers of sporadic members since December 2011, imagining about the whole group and its songs.\n\nSo what has made SME so successful over so many years? It used to be SME’s good music, but not anymore. In my opinion, it’s the amazing marketing skills that make SME an extremely profitable company today. Let’s take a look.\n\nBy promoting a huge group, EXO, and by spliting it into two sub-groups, EXO-K and EXO-M, SM Entertainment takes care of two great aspects:\n\nIt allows more trainees to be debuted, which means more fans, more CDs and albums sold, and more profits. Also, because the group is divided into 2 sub-groups, nobody can really judge SM for releasing the same songs for EXO-K and EXO-M because they are really one big group. This allows SM Entertainment to be lazy as it wants – no need to put too much effort in coming up with songs, just let them sing the same song in different languages!\n\nIt prevents the chaotic and crowded situation for stage performances and activities. By splitting a huge group of 12 members into 2 sub-groups of 6 members each, SM allows EXO to perform on stage without having a huge mass group, which keeps the stage performances cleaner (the dances would look more in sync and it won’t look like a huge flash mob – Super Junior anyone?). What’s more, it lets each member sing more than one line in each song (Super Junior again, anyone?) because there are fewer members in the sub-group, allowing more attention and focus on each individual, which in terms would increase fan number for each member, multiplying the number of CDs, albums, concert tickets, and other things sold.\n\nThe second new method SM has developed is the concept of “endless teasers” and “prologue singles”. By releasing sporadic teasers over a relatively long period, SM successfully pull people’s heart up:”Oh my, when are they debuting? … Ahhh I can’t wait! … Why are they still releasing teasers?! I want to see their debut! …” By creating an itch and curiosity in people’s heart, SM develops huge anticipation for its new group – EXO. But sometimes teasers can get tiring – people start to get sick of it, they start\n\nwhining. And that’s when the prologue songs come in. SM lets a bit music out, and all the craving and awaiting people would start freaking out and embrace in joy: “Oh my! They released a song! THEY RELEASED A SONG!!!” By releasing a prologue song, SM successfully refreshes the awaiting people’s energy and hence brings all the attention back to EXO’s debut. What’s another advantage of the prologue songs? SM can make the music video as cheesy and low-cost as they want, but it won’t matter because the release itself would become a joy for the awaiting people; SM and EXO members don’t need to worry about practicing crazily for performances on shows like Music Banks, Inkigayo yet because even though they released a song, it’s not their debut – so they can save up good work and energy for their official debut. The concept of prologue song is stupid to me, since a song is a song no matter what you call it, but this skill is definitely effective. In the future, I expect SME to have more and more “prologue songs” and maybe even more and more teasers for its new artists, since this method is proved successful by EXO’s promotion now.\n\nSee how SME earns money now? What’s scarier, SME is continuously developing its marketing skills. As an attempt of promoting many trainees without deliberating on grouping them into 3 different standard-numbered groups or more than 10 individual singers, SM first came up with Super Junior with 12 members, the biggest boy group at that time. And SM has tasted the sweetness of having huge groups (lots of fans, lots of sales). However, after some time SM starts to realize that with such a huge group, the performing stage can look very chaotic (the more members, the harder to keep everyone in sync), and fans start to complain about how each member only gets to sing about one line in every single song. So SM started thinking about new ways – and here EXO is.Realizing that there’s a huge market in China, SM also puts more and more Chinese members in every group they have – at first there was only Han Geng in Super Junior, then there was Henry and Zhou Mi, who joined Super Junior M (Chinese promotion branch of Super Junior) later on. Then we have f(x) with Victoria, and now SM has come up with EXO, in which half of the members are Chinese, and the rest all know Chinese language as well.\n\nIn terms of music, SM also developed – except it didn’t develop for better quality music, but more profitable music, that is, the “addictive and repetitive” music. Super Junior and Girls’ Generation both debuted with nice unique songs (“Twins” and “Into The New World”, respectively), yet after knowing that repetitive electronic songs like “Gee” and “Sorry Sorry” would really stick in people’s head and therefore haunt them until they buy the songs, SME stopped producing unique songs for title songs. Instead, Super Junior keeps coming back with all repetitive songs like “Bonamana”, “Superman”, “Mr. Simple”, and “A-Cha”. Girls’ Generation, similarly, promotes “Genie”, “Oh”, “Hoot”, and “Run Devil Run”. Though the music quality decreased, SME definitely has earned lots of money.\n\nOf course, there are also victims of SME’s experiments for markets and better profit. After succeeding with TVXQ as they debuted with a grand Chinese name 東方神起 meaning “The Rise of the God (the sun in this meaning) of the East”, SME promoted a girl group also with a Chinese name, 天上智喜 (The Grace), hoping that this format would also be a success. However, things didn’t go so well – not that The Grace failed entirely, but somehow it didn’t become an icon as huge as TVXQ. And SM isn’t that kind of nice company that supports its entertainers’ dream and wills – so SM kept on changing The Grace, altering its style, procrastinating its comeback schedule, or even ignoring it for more than a year. The Grace unfortunately has become the victim of SME’s marketing skill experiments.\n\nI personally feel sorry for SM Entertainment even though I am in LOVE with SME’s artists and entertainers. I feel bad that it has turned from a great music studio into a commercial company that nevertheless has lots of supporters – but it has lost what it first started for. The initial dream and goal are lost.\n\nHowever, I am still looking forward to EXO’s debut, and maybe 20 more teasers before that. If you are interested as well, then please stay tuned 🙂 .\n\n——————————-\n\n* Pictures in the music video are the snapshots I took from SM’s official MV for “History”.
