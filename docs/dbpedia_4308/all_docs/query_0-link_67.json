        "text": "By Ho Yi / STAFF REPORTER\n\nSetting itself apart from Ho-Hai-Yan or Formoz Festival with its inclination to facilitate exchanges among local and foreign indie music labels, Indie Music Festival, organized by the Taiwan Music Culture International Alternation Association (TMC), will join up with the Association of Visual Arts in Taiwan (AVAT) to bring the 10-day audio visual festival entitled Art Taiwan! Indie Festival and Artist Fair (2005台灣聲視好大－硬地音樂展暨藝術家博覽會).\n\nThe art carnival is slated to open today and will run through next Sunday at the Chinese Culture and Movie Center (中影文化城) at 34, Zhishan Rd, Sec. 2, Shilin District, Taipei (台北市士林區至善路二段34號).\n\nAll the local indie acts you can name, established or on the fringe, will join the big parade and play non-stop over the weekend. To give a hint as to what you can expect at the musical extravaganza, performers include rapper Cheng Chen-yue (張震嶽), Free 9 and MC Hotdog, rock/pop acts Soda Green, So What, The Chairman (董事長), Petite Nurse (小護士), Peppercats (胡椒貓), Back Quarter (四分衛), Nylas, 8mm Sky, heavy metal combo Chthonic (閃靈), infamous anarchist LTK Commune (濁水溪公社) and Aboriginal folk musicians Samingad (紀曉君) and Biung (王宏恩).\n\nTo make full use of the movie center, which is itself a large film set for an ancient Chinese city, the main stage is constructed in front of the moat with two magnificent city gates on both sides, whereas smaller stages will be scattered around on the ancient streets inside the city. Amid the deafening fusion of guitars, heavy metal, pop and folk, booths at the music expo will provide good starting points for visitors and industry professionals to look though over 50 indie music labels, both from home and abroad.\n\nThe Artist Fair will carry on the festival after this weekend's musical bashes on stages. The less-loud event will features a series of lectures, art guides and art presentations including body paintings, performing art acts and graffiti and graphic art.\n\nTickets for the indie music festival cost NT$200 for one day and NT$500 for three days of performances, available at the door or through ERA ticketing outlets.\n\nFor more information, you can visit www.avat-art.org or www.tmc.org.tw. And for those who are interested in joining the various art activities, workshops and panel discussions, you can call (02) 3322 4182 to make a reservation for seats."
