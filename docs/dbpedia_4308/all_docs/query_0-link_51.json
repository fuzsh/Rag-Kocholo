        "text": "Wu Qing-feng, widely known as Greeny and credited as Wu Tsing-fong, stands as a luminary figure in Taiwanese music, distinguished as a singer-songwriter, composer, arranger, and lyricist. Born in Taipei, Wu is best recognized as the lead vocalist and a founding member of Oaeen (Sodagreen), a band where his profound influence as the primary composer and lyricist has shaped their distinctive sound.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Wu has garnered acclaim not only for his contributions to Oaeen but also for his solo ventures. He embarked on his solo journey in 2018, showcasing his versatility and musical prowess. His debut solo studio album, “Spaceman,” released in 2019, marked a significant milestone, earning him multiple nominations at the Golden Melody Awards and clinching the coveted Best Male Mandarin Singer title.\n\nIn 2021, Wu continued to captivate audiences with his second solo album, “Folio Vol.1: One and One,” reaffirming his status as a formidable solo artist and earning yet another nomination for Best Male Mandarin Singer. His genre-defying music, often categorized as indie pop, not only resonates deeply but also enriches Mandopop with his literary lyrics and innovative compositions.\n\nBeyond his studio work, Wu has ventured into television, participating notably in talent shows like “The Coming One 2” and “Singer 2019,” where his artistry and vocal prowess captivated viewers nationwide. His live performances, such as the innovative Recto and Verso Concert at Cloud Gate Theater, underscore his ability to blend music and theatrical elements into a captivating artistic experience.\n\nWu Qing-feng’s contributions to Taiwanese music are profound and enduring, solidifying his legacy as a visionary artist and storyteller in the Mandopop landscape."
