        "text": "Not long before I starting choosing a ‘record of the week’, back in 1985, Pet Shop Boys released the original, Bobby Orlando produced version of West End Girls. It charted very modestly in Canada, but wasn’t officially released in the UK. Follow-up singles One More Chance and Opportunities (Let’s Make Lots Of Money) hardly fared any better. The duo’s decision to re-record their debut single proved to be a good one. At the end 1985, I made this new version my record of the week, and it went on to become a worldwide hit (I don’t claim any connection between those two events 😉).\n\nFast forward to 2024… To date, Pet Shop Boys amassed 18 of my weekly accolades. More than any other artist. Guess that makes them my all-time favourite act. This week, they add a 19th gong to their name, and it’s an extra special one this time…\n\nPet Shop Boys aren’t only known for their great singles. Their B-sides are often equally brilliant. In fact, most of their B-sides are better than other artists’ A-sides! Take for instance Paninaro (later a single in it’s own right), You Know Where You Went Wrong, Do I Have To?, Your Funny Uncle, Screaming, We’re The Pet Shop Boys, No Time For Tears… the list is endless.\n\nForty years into their career, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe never stopped delivering. No disrespect to their new single Feel, but I love it’s B-side Everybody Will Dance. A classic, hi-NRG Pet Shop Boys track, that has waited nine years to be released. It was written and demoed in 2015 during song-writing sessions prior to the recording of their album Super. However, they decided against recording it themselves because they felt it was ‘a little young’ for them. Tennant & Lowe intended to offer it to someone else instead. I’m glad they finally decided to put this gem out!\n\nEverybody Will Dance by Pet Shop Boys is the new Carte Blanche Music Wildcard. This implies that it will be prominently displayed at the top of the blog for an entire week.\n\nMore Pet Shop Boys @ Carte Blanche Music\n\nFollow the duo on Facebook | Instagram | X | Spotify\n\nIn the Wildcards 2024 playlist you’ll find all of this year’s Carte Blanche Music Wildcards so far.\n\nI’m a music industry watcher and journalist. Worked at a CD club, a record store chain and was editor in chief of an entertainment trade magazine. Have been in the radio business since 1987, producing and presenting shows. Was music director of several stations. Also, I developed the European Border Breakers Chart, Music Moves Europe Talent Chart and ESNS Chart. CEO of Werner Bros. tekst | uitleg.\n\nKid Kapichi are a punk band from Hastings, Great Britain. They just released their third album There Goes The Neighbourhood, which was produced by Nothing But Thieves member Dom Craik. It introduces us to their view on the world today, and that’s not necessarily an optimistic one, to put it mildly. More to the point, it captures the zeitgeist of the dissatisfying reality of living in the UK in 2024. Lyrically, the songs denounce ‘grey Britain’ and small-island thinking. Surely, not a message everyone will want to hear.\n\nThe long-player was preceded by four great singles, but one album track really stands out for me. This track, with a sound halfway Ian Dury and The Hives, is called Can EU Hear Me? Obviously, that’s not a typo in there. It’s a punch in the face of Brexit. “The worst thing that’s happened to this country in quite some time”, according to the song.\n\nStill, the band manages to address the subject with the dry sense of humour and wit we’ve come to know from them. “You can’t just separate a tectonic plate, mate”, Jack Wilson sings.\n\nOn the website of the Union State venue in Washington DC, the vocalist further explains: “The brief was, ‘Let’s write the happiest Brexit song we can’! It’s sad to see it, but we make a big effort to make sure that whoever we meet over there knows that it doesn’t represent the country as a whole. That’s what this song is all about.”\n\nAlthough it’s not a single (yet), Kid Kapichi’s Can EU Hear Me? is the new Carte Blanche Music Wildcard. This implies that it will be prominently displayed at the top of the blog for an entire week.\n\nFollow Kid Kapichi on Facebook | Instagram | X | Spotify\n\nIn the Wildcards 2024 playlist you’ll find all of this year’s Carte Blanche Music Wildcards so far.\n\nI’m a music industry watcher and journalist.

Mark Owens (his real name) has been showing up here regularly in the past few years.\n\nHe released his first EP Too Many Teeth – containing the singles he put out prior – in June 2020. Now, 3½ years later, EP #4, Call Me Trunky, sees the light. A 5-track opus that sounds like the best version of everything he’s done before. This is an artist on top of his game.\n\nApart from the three former singles, the EP holds two new tracks. Appropriately, it rounds off with This Is The End, which is preceded by my favourite: Death On TV. The latter combines melodic verses with pounding choruses. A sure fire future live banger.\n\nThe EP is entirely self-released, all the more reason to support it to the fullest.\n\nAlthough it’s not a single, Death On TV by Trunky Juno is the new Carte Blanche Music Wildcard. This implies that it will be prominently displayed at the top of the blog for an entire week.\n\nMore Trunky Juno @ Carte Blanche Music\n\nFollow Trunky Juno on Facebook | Instagram | X | Spotify\n\nIn the Wildcards 2023 playlist you’ll find all of this year’s Carte Blanche Music Wildcards so far.\n\nI’m a music industry watcher and journalist.
