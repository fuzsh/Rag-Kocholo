Their music is characterized by their fast-paced rock ballads, as well as their electrifying rock anthems. Their looks and long hair stand out from the mainstream Chinese pop scene because of their resemblance to typical western Heavy Metal musicians. In 2001, Power Station released their first album on the Grand Music label (later known as HIM International Music), Walking along Jhonghsiao East Street Nine Times.
