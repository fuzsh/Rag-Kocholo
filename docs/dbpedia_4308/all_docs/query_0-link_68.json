        "text": "Sodagreen, the mando-pop’s hottest Taiwan indie band, are now celebrating the 10th anniversary – Air World Tour. Their first shows took place at the Hong Kong Coliseum on April 11-13. And I went to the one on April 11.\n\nI have listened to their music for 8 years, and this was my second time of coming to their concert. In my view, Sodagreen is one of the most successful indie bands in Taiwan, since they have sparked the musical trend Xiao Qingxin, which use low profile and lyrics to describe simple emotions. When listening to their songs, you can feel the sincerity of their music, which is really inspiring. It seems like that your life has been written in their songs, and you are not only listening to a piece of music, but listening to yourself.\n\nAs this is their 10th anniversary world tour of their debut, this concert was a lot different from previous shows. They had rearranged the melody of their songs to build a fresh feeling. When we heard the intro we had no idea what the song was, and kept listening, it turned out to be a song that we are quite familiar with. What even surprising is that they set up a what-would-you-like-to-hear period for fans to order the song freely. And Wu Tsing-fong, the Vocal of Sodagreen, even went down to the stadium to ask the audiences what they want to hear. I have to say it was a very interesting and interactive concert. It’s really worth going!!\n\nYou may have the same feeling with me that when we grow up, we may leave our hometown and sometimes even separate from our parents, because we want to fight for a better life on our own. In this case, Crowd Lu’s new single becomes even more touching. In this song he says that even we are not staying with our beloved ones, we don’t need to feel that we are lonely. Actually, we are still with them to a large extent for they will always stay in our minds.\n\nWhat needs to be mentioned is that the pictures in this music video reflect the daily life in Hong Kong, which surprised me so much!\n\nThis song is really encouraging.\n\nLyrics:\n\n大人中\n\n曲：盧廣仲\n\n詞：盧廣仲、討海人、威廉霍華\n\n安靜的人 想很多\n\n說話的人 專心說\n\n上班的人 在五樓\n\n下班的人 獲得自由\n\n勉強的人 不快樂\n\n快樂的人 那就是我\n\n你也想 跟我一樣\n\n雨下起來唱了首歌\n\n遠方 遠方 哪裡才是遠\n\n原來愛人不在身邊 就叫\n\n遠方 遠方\n\n還好我愛的人永遠住在我心臟\n\n長大後誰不是離家出走\n\n茫茫人海裡游\n\n抬起頭才發現\n\n流眼淚的星星正在放棄我\n\n請擁抱我\n\n萬一我不小心墜落\n\n不想勤勞 想放空\n\n太常失敗 好想成功\n\n車水馬龍裡我抓著\n\n支持我活著的 快樂\n\n長大後我們都離家出走\n\n茫茫人海裡游\n\n抬起頭才發現\n\n流眼淚的星星正在看著我\n\n他說：加油，讓我為你\n\n感到光榮！\n\n雨過天清涼涼的\n\n我不用再擔心什麼\n\n那些 花都 怒放了\n\n愛人的人 獲得自由\n\nCheer Chen, one of my favorite Taiwan indie music artists, held two concerts in Hong Kong in March. I was so lucky that I bought the last one, which was on March 8th, because we encored 3 times and the concert was extended to 11:55!!!\n\nThe video I recorded that night is a song of her new album, named Peace & Revolution. I think it is a really interesting song for its international style. It conveys the modern thoughts through the melody and her murmur-style singing.\n\nHope you will enjoy it.\n\nTaiwan’s No.1 outdoor music festival, Spring Wave Music and Art Festival came to Hong Kong last year. I was so excited, because this music festival is sooooooo Great!!!!!!!!! It’s an annual event which has been held in Kenting, Taiwan since 1995. Spring Wave Music and Art Festival promotes peace and love on earth, and every year it attracts more than 20000 people.\n\nFor their debut show in Hong Kong, many wonderful artists line-up for this event such as Jiajia, Jam Hsiao, Cheer Chen, Zhang Zhenyue, MC Hotdog, Khalil Fong.They are all very good Taiwan artists, which make the first Hong Kong show of Spring Wave Music and Art Festival Spring a blast. This is a great show that should not be missed by music lovers or anyone interested in different types of genres!\n\nI’d glad that I went to this wonderful event. Let me show you how great the music festival was!\n\nOver The Hill is a brand-new band in Taiwan. However, they are not THAT new, because this is a band formed by four experienced singers – Ciacia, Ze’ Hwang, Lisa and Cai Kunqi. They are all over fourty, so they named the band Over The Hill. This song describes an attitude that after spending many time and efforts on pursuing what we want, we could take everything easy when we are old.\n\nIt is AWESOME !!\n\nLyrics:\n\nI’m over the hill, I’m over the hill\n\nI’m over the hill, I’m over the hill\n\nI’m over the hill, I’m over the hill\n\nI’m over the hill, I’m over the hill\n\nI’ve spent a lot of years trying to climb up the mountain\n\nTo reach the highest point of my life 不管多曲折\n\n直到一雙雙破爛的鞋 我不再捨不得\n\n直到我不再懷疑 可以把你丟了\n\n詮釋一個角色 無論說甚麼做甚麼都是我的選擇\n\n走過這一段旅程 失去的那個人已不重要了\n\nI’m spinning around and around\n\nSoon I have been over the hill\n\n當我數著日子 How fast will they go?\n\nTimes 9.8 meters per second square\n\nI’ve met a lot of jerks though I try to keep in distance\n\nThey burn the bridges down after they cross the river\n\n直到一張張破碎的臉 我早已不記得\n\n於是我不再擔心有到不了的城鎮\n\n看過許多景色 那些生命裡錯過了留不住是緣份\n\n走過了千萬哩程 該放的那個石頭 就讓它滾\n\nOh, I’ve been all over the world\n\nAnd now I am over the hill\n\n當我數著日子 How far will they go?\n\nDivided by the numbers of my regrets\n\nDivided by the numbers of my regrets\n\nDivided by the numbers of my regrets\n\nDivided by the numbers of my regrets\n\nI’m over the hill, I’m over the hill\n\nDo you like Taiwan indie music?
