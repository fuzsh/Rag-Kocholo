Besides, she is also one of the performers of the night. The theme of her performance is “Beauty”.\n\nJolin’s reaction to her nominations:\n\nJolin Tsai: “So shocked! I’m opening the champagne to celebrate. Everybody, please cheer in your own space then dismiss. ❤❤❤❤❤”\n\nAlso her, “Once again, I’d like to thank everyone who has participated in this album, all the remarkable working partners who work in front and behind the scenes. In the process of creating this album, no one is excluded! Ugly Beauty is you who’ve been honest to yourself, you who’s very brave even when you felt that you’re weak! Thank you life, looking forward to the next phase of myself! I’m totally satisfied with the nomination! Thanks to all the juries, love y’ all! #marktheday #uglybeauty #goldenmelodyaward #nominations #teamjolin”\n\nWhen she was being asked which GMA award she wants the most, Jolin wants to take Best MV and Best Mandarin Album. She felt sorry for the director when PLAY mv did not win the award. By winning the best album, it means that all the team and production will get recognised. Best Song Producer is fresh to her as well.\n\nBoth Jolin Tsai and Sandy Lam are the big winners in the GMA nominations, both of them have received 7 nominations! The grand jury of this year GMA, Sandee Chan said that, “Jolin’s album is more multifaceted. From A&R to the production, including her personal setting, performance, the social agenda which brought out empathy, every part that is related is being covered & taken care of. All the juries have recognised that it’s an excellent album.”\n\nCheck out her 7 Golden Melody Awards Nominations.\n\n*Disclaimer, all the commentary are purely based on what I have read, listen & watch from the music critics & comments from radio station, music streaming platform and newspaper. (Also a little bias from my observation)\n\nCheck out the full list of 2019 GMA nominees here, 30th Golden Melody Awards 2019: Full Bilingual Nominations List.\n\n《 最佳音樂錄影帶獎 》Best Music Video\n\nDirectorMusic VideoArtistAlbumYuta Sekiyama 関山雄太Go SlowDeca Joins《Go Slow》Birdy Hong 洪博德 ＆Mo Pan 潘昱伶 Millennia’s Faith Undone 烏牛欄大護法CHTHONIC 閃靈《政治 Battlefields of Asura》Muh Chen 陳奕仁Seventeen 十七S.H.ESeventeen 《十七》Namso, YoukimSlowSunset Rollercoaster 落日飛車《CASSA NOVA 半熟王子》Namewee 黃明志10 Ways to End 十種自殺的方法Ribbon Ooi 黃若熙Gain 《獲得》Bobby Chen 陳昇Good Taiwan 台灣好Bobby Chen 陳昇South Airport Folks《南機場人》Robert YoungbloodSabrina Don’t Get Married Again!Joanna Wang 王若琳Modern Tragedy《摩登悲劇》Muh Chen 陳奕仁Ugly Beauty 怪美的Jolin Tsai《Ugly Beauty》\n\nBest Music Video Awards is always not on Jolin’s side. From Honey Trap, The Great Artist, Play, We’re All Different, Yet the Same & I’m Not Yours, Jolin was snubbed in this category. Each year’s judges seemed to love music video which is taken outdoor instead of inside the studio with many CGI/animation. They enhance on the cinematography, story line or something out of the box like “OK Go music video”, craft & stop motion. Millennia’s Faith Undone’s music video is about the 228 Incident took place in 1947, it showcased the White Terror being faced by Taiwanese and how the social activists was prosecuted, leaving lots of data and evidence. Seventeen records S.H.E’s 17 years of friendship and their important incidents during their 17 years of music career. Hebe is the first who release her first solo album, Ella focused on TV programmes, acting career and also becoming a mother. The climax/tear jerking scene of the music video is when Selina faced the explosion accident which brings the major twist to her and S.H.E’s career. Ugly Beauty explores society beauty standard, Jolin’s self-judgement and how the current Jolin forgiving the old Jolin.\n\n《 最佳演唱錄音專輯獎 》Best Vocal Recording Album\n\nAlbumArtistEngineers《Matzka Station》Matzka（Main Recording Engineer：倪涵文、雷長航、李卓、Jorge Espinosa-Cruz、Andy Baker、蔡周翰、恭碩良、荒井十一、單為明、周天澈／Main Mixing Engineer：周天澈／Main Mastering Engineer：Ted Jensen）《2029》Lexie Liu（Main Recording Engineer：Kenn Wu／Main Mixing Engineer：Bob Horn、Jochem Van Der Sag／Main Mastering Engineer：Randy Merrill）《0》Sandy Lam 林憶蓮（Main Recording Engineer：倪涵文、林灝揚Y.Lam、張德銘Derrick Sepnio、常石磊、李卓／Main Mixing Engineer：Brent Clark／Main Mastering Engineer：Ryan Smith）《SHA YAN》Karencici（Main Recording Engineer：張暐弘、蔡周翰、單為明、Karencici、kvn、馬丁、Jason Park,Newos／Main Mixing Engineer：Daniela Rivera、kvn、麻吉弟弟、仔仔(Will Peng)／Main Mastering Engineer：Chris Gehringer）《Ugly Beauty》Jolin Tsai（Main Recording Engineer：Jansen Chen 陳振發、AJ Chen 陳文駿、Zachary Lin 林清智、Micky Yang 楊敏奇、YuHsuan Yeh 葉育軒、Mimi Tang 唐士珉(瞇瞇)、Chief Wang 王永鈞、Chou Han Tsay 蔡周翰、Howe Chen 陳君豪、Jason Hsu 徐振程／Main Mixing Engineer：Luca Pretolesi、Andy Lin、Scott Banks、Phil Tan、Bill Zimmerman、Ziya Huang 黃文萱／Main Mastering Engineer：Luca Pretolesi）\n\nFYI, this award was reintroduced again after 19 years during GMA26 and Jolin’s PLAY is the first artist to win this album. Karencici who has written Lady in Red has been nominated for Best New Artist too, you can listen to lots of Hip hop and R&B in her new album SHA YAN.

Usually, it’s other senior producer who got nominated and won this category like Adia for Dancing Diva (lose), Adia for Agent J (win), Starr Chen for Play (lose) & Andrew Chen for Lip Reading (Win). Yellow released their EP last year with 3 songs only and you can find Soul, R&B & Jazz in this EP. Sandee Chan is the grand judge of this years GMA and so she won’t get to vote in this category. Chen Chien-Chi (Arrange Gentlewomen) is an experienced musician who produced lots of excellent album including Eve Ai’s Fade to Exist. 1993 is Eli Hsieh’s confession about what he has been through. It’s written for her mum and also all the great mums around the world for raising and supporting their children. Look Howe Chen is here!\n\n《 年度歌曲獎 》Song of the Year\n\nSongArtistAlbumMillennia’s Faith Undone (The Aeon’s Wraith Version) 烏牛欄大護法(望天版)CHTHONIC 閃靈, Denise Ho 何韻詩Millennia’s Faith Undone (The Aeon’s Wraith Version) 《烏牛欄大護法(望天版)》To Be Together海裡睡人Eason Chan 陳奕迅《L.O.V.E. = 愛》Seventeen 十七S.H.ESeventeen 《十七》Core 沙文Sandy Lam 林憶蓮《0》Newly Written Old Song 新寫的舊歌Jonathan Lee 李宗盛Newly Written Old Song《新寫的舊歌》Waves Wandering 浪流連EggPlantEgg 茄子蛋Waves Wandering 《浪流連》Womxnly 玫瑰少年Jolin Tsai《Ugly Beauty》\n\nThis awards is about the song that best represents the important incidents that happened in Taiwan in 2018. Jolin has won this category before with The Great Artist. As mentioned, Millennia’s Faith Undone featuring Denise Ho is a Taiwanese song inspired by the February 28 incidents which happened in Nantou, Taiwan, discussing how the activists fight against authoritarianism. The music video is the heavy metal version whereas SOTY is folk version. This song actually reflects how the people sacrificing and pursuing democracy and it also matches with the current Taiwan and what happened around Taiwan like last year’s mayor election, referendum result, Hong Kong’s Anti Extradition protest and 2020 Taiwan President Election. “浪流連” describes how the people who are aimless following how the wave moves. Waves Wandering talks about the youth who feel lost when they are chasing their dreams. They work very hard for their dream, hoping they can be successful one day. Waves Wandering has the highest view in YouTube among the nominees. Seventeen was written by our beloved QingFeng Wu both song and lyrics, the touching song records the 17 years of close friendship. Written by the late Ellen Loo 😭😭😭 and popular pianist Anthony Sun, To Be Together talks about every time when Eason was working with his duo band makes him feel like he just woke up. Written by the big brother of Chinese pop music, Newly Written Old Song talks about the gap between him and his father. Jonathan Lee wants to use this song to make up with his late father. Every problem is just like an old song, this is a conversation between him and himself, answering his doubt. Jonathan Lee is really the BIG BROTHER and he always win the award. Ashin was the backup singer and also the arranger for this song, Core. Lyrics was written by our beloved Qing Feng Wu, talks about chauvinism, domestic abuse and gender. It’s a rock feminist song consist of anger and oppression. Lastly, Womxnly talks about gender identity, body liberation and also voice out to the LGBTQ+ community, it matches to the current issues like the legalisation of same-sex marriage and last year’s referendum result. According to Ashin, Womxnly started with Jolin’s first draft, about a true tragic story. After reading and thinking for a long time, also with the help of the counselling volunteer (Chen Yiru) in looking for a perspective, he finally submitted the lyrics after 6 months.\n\n《 最佳國語女歌手獎 》Best Female Mandarin Singer\n\nArtistAlbumEve Ai 艾怡良Fade to Exist 《垂直活著，水平留戀著。 》Shi Shi 孫盛希Shi’s Journey 《希遊記》Yoyo Sham 岑寧兒《Nothing Is Under Control》Sandy Lam 林憶蓮《0》Jolin Tsai《Ugly Beauty》\n\nThis category is also known as war of goddess because every nominee deserved to win this award! Among the nominees, there are 3 Best Female Singers and 2 young bloods. Jolin was 18th GMA Best Female Singer, Sandy was 24th GMA Best Female Singer whereas Eve Ai was 28th GMA Best Female Singer. All of the nominees wrote their song, Yoyo Sham and Eve Ai are nominated with their Fully Self-Written Album (meaning the songs and lyrics were written by the singer).You might know Yoyo Sham from this hit song, she was the musician and background singer for many popular artist like Eason Chan. Her music are more on the indie side until the release of the hit song Light Chaser. In 《Nothing Is Under Control》, she sings about some little things and the life situation (Scrambled egg, coffee bubbles, boarding) matching her tender voice, it’s raw, natural and free. Shi Shi released Shi’s Jouney 3 months after her third album, Woman. Shi’s Journey is a experimental album. She handles different kind of genre like Jazz, R&B, Disco & Urban, you can notice the layers of her voice and her singing style are changing with the genre. Fade to Exist is Eve Ai‘s forth studio album and her first Fully Self-Written Album. After writing several hits for aMei and Lala Hsu, Eve wants to sing her own story written by her herself. Eve used to be very strong and sharp in her singing from her previous album, her voice is more tender and less restraint this time. 6 years after the release of the magnificent album Gaia, Sandy Lam comes back with a more meticulous and more experimental album, 0. Sandy is the senior among the nominees, the way she sings is perfect in terms of layers, tone and articulation. Her voice is soft but not weak, it’s powerful and tough. From the first song to the last song, Jolin is like telling a different story, it’s rich and diverse. The ways of performing the songs are different, she is not pursuing for perfection but more on singing from the heart. Some critics think that the lyric and the melody doesn’t match and some think that it’s experimental.\n\n《 最佳國語專輯獎 》Best Mandarin Album\n\n《愛麗絲 Where Are We Going ?》Eli Hsieh 謝震廷《0》Sandy Lam 林憶蓮Wu Bing Singing, Yo Chin Soothing 《無病呻吟有情抒情》Leo WangFade to Exist 《垂直活著，水平留戀著。 》Eve Ai 艾怡良Shi’s Journey 《希遊記》Shi Shi 孫盛希《 ØZI: The Album》ØZI《Ugly Beauty》Jolin Tsai\n\nWu Bing Singing, Yo Chin Soothing is Leo Wang’s third solo album and it’s critically acclaimed. Leo Wang is from a music duo called Yeemao and he just want to express on what he want to says in this hip hop album. It’s a more entertaining album than an ambitious album.\n\nBorn in 1997, ØZI is described as the “nuclear level” new coming artist. His first released album ØZI: The Album has received 6 GMA nominations. His album is retro yet stylish, the main genre are Hip Hop and R&B which reflect the current trend. He raps and he writes and produces his own album. ØZI also co-produced Jolin’s Hubby, he is the backing vocal arranger and vocal producer.\n\nFade to Exist is Eve Ai’s first Fully Self-Written Album. The album is cohesive and tense at the same time. This album explores on how to face the lost, memory which leading to the topic, death. She wants everyone to say what you want to say whenever you have the chance. So that, you won’t regret.Besides the soulful Eve, we can listen to a different version of her and we can fully see her potential and future from this album.\n\nShi’s Journey has multiple genre including R&B、Motown、Funk、Disco、Slow rock. It’s a very high standard album, the voice matches the melody, the sound and the production are perfect. Shi Shi has participated in arranging the song, 2 songs has helped her to get nominated for Best Arranger. The experimental album is an outcome from the collaboration of her and other musicians, they write and compose spontaneously.\n\n0 continues the concept of Gaia, it expands from the land to the universe. There are songs with atmosphere and also the explosive ones. “The listeners get to experience a breath-taking soundscape, filled to the brim with subtle yet unforgettable melodies, whilst enjoying lyrics that seamlessly weave between broad, thought-provoking issues whilst being extremely intimate. On the albums most vulnerable moments, her voice is like another layer of instrumentation, adding to the vulnerability on display.” (Allow me to quote this from asianpopweekly.com) The grand jury, Sandee Chan even praised that the lyrics and the songs are so meticulously made, creating a new aesthetic.\n\nBefore the release of Where Are We Going?, Eli Hsieh has been suffering from anxiety disorder which makes him taking a rest for at least 2 years. His mother is diagnosed with cancer which further affecting his living condition. After moving his mother to stay with him, his situation is improved and all of these inspires him to produce this album. If Charlie from his last album, Charlie’s Report represents a newborn, going through lots of pain when growing up which means hate, the song 1993 signifies love and acceptance, after going through pains, he finally understands love. There is no complex words or techniques to create the emotion, he uses his tenderness in the music combining children literature or song like Alice in the Wonderland & Little Stars to express the emotion.\n\nJolin Tsai’s Ugly Beauty is the final chapter of “Self-Exploration series” started from Myself, it discusses everything that she has faced during her 19 years of career. She turns every critics, mocking and pains into melody and has a beautiful strike back. The theme of the album is about introspection and she came to an agreement with her old self. Jolin breaks the glass ceiling again with this album, every song has a unique approach in exploring the beauty and ugliness, each of the song is carefully planned from the lyrics, to the melody, arrangement, music video and even performance. Jolin is brave enough to browse through all her dark history and her dark side, she self-deprecating herself to prove that she is not scared anymore. The difficulty faced by Jolin is that she needs to handle the “greatest common divisor” to challenge herself, she can’t do anything which is over experimental or indie for the sake of breakthrough or innovation without burden. And she kills it again, she is able to change, to challenge and breakthrough that is acceptable without losing the audience.\n\nAfter reading all the critics and analysis, they keywords that I found are Experimental, Concept, Breakthrough, Depth and Meticulous. I think it’s a fight between 0, Where Are We Going? and Ugly Beauty.\n\n《年度專輯獎 》Album of the Year\n\nAlbumArtist《Ugly Beauty》Jolin TsaiNominees of Best Mandarin Album《愛麗絲 Where Are We Going ?》Eli Hsieh 謝震廷《0》Sandy Lam 林憶蓮Wu Bing Singing, Yo Chin Soothing 《無病呻吟有情抒情》Leo WangFade to Exist 《垂直活著，水平留戀著。 》Eve Ai 艾怡良Shi’s Journey 《希遊記》Shi Shi 孫盛希《 ØZI: The Album》ØZI《L.O.V.E. = 愛》Eason Chan 陳奕迅*The only album that’s nominated in Best Language Album《政治 Battlefields of Asura》CHTHONIC 閃靈Nominees of Best Taiwanese Album《露螺 Snails》Joey Chiang 江惠儀 Tsa-bóo gín-á 《查某囡仔》Nana Lee 李千那《爵好 Jazz’s Good!》Emily Kuan 官靈芝Warming a Pot of Youth to Drink 《溫一壺青春下酒》Ardor Huang 流氓阿德Darknet 《暗網》Dwagie 大支Forgotten West 《西部》Sam Liao 廖士賢Drifting 《漂移》Voter Hsu 徐哲緯, Huang Wei-chieh 黃瑋傑, Liu Jung-chang 劉榮昌 and Yeh Yu-ting 葉鈺渟Nominees of Best Hakka AlbumReturn&Restore 《轉》iColor 愛客樂 Stay 《落腳》Lo Ssu-jung 羅思容Love for Granted 《理所當然》Gina Yang 楊淑喻《Swasieq 斯瓦細格》Yawai Mawlin 雅維·茉芮Nominees of Best Aboriginal Language AlbumSenglit 《思念》Muniyu 沐妮悠《Vangav 天窗》Cemelesai 徹摩Yuan Yin Cheng Xian A Mei Zu Fu Yin Chuan Chang 《原音呈現 阿美族複音傳唱》Wu Chia-lu 吳家祿, Tseng Kuang-fu 曾光復, Wang Fu-lai 王福來, Yang Shih-mei 楊拾妹, Lin Jung-mei 林榮妹, and Kuo Mei-yu 郭美玉《Ti Cemelesai Ata Salasaladj》 阿新與他的朋友們Kerekelj 沈昉禎 & Eleng 林瑋琪\n\nThis category might mean it’s the best album release from 2018 in Taiwan. However, there is no clear perspective on this because the winner of Album of the Year is not necessarily selected from the winner of each Best Album from each language. But this award is necessary because it’s an award with no language limitation, that’s why Eason’s Cantonese album can be nominated.\n\nMy Picks from the nominees\n\nBiggest snubs\n\nEvery year there are the artist who are expected to be in the nomination list (and the main awards) but they are not. Here’re my list of the biggest snubs for this year GMA.\n\nMy Predictions/Bet\n\nAs much as I hope Jolin bag all 7 awards but let’s be real, it’s GMA, it’s unpredictable, it’s very hard to win. Forgive me for being pessimistic. It happens to other artists before that they have 7/8/9 nominations and 0 win. Here are my predictions.\n\nBest Music Video – Yuta Sekiyama, Go Slow\n\nBest Vocal Recording Album – 《Ugly Beauty》\n\nProducer of the Year (Single) – Starr Chen & Jolin Tsai\n\nSong of the Year – Womxnly\n\nBest Female Mandarin Singer – Sandy Lam\n\nBest Mandarin Album – 《愛麗絲 Where Are We Going ?》\n\nAlbum of the Year – 《0》\n\nBy seeing this years’ nomination, we can see that Hip Hop starts gaining more attention, it also means the juries are mostly quite young (LOL). If the juries want to give more encouragement to the younger artist, Shi Shi and Eli Hsieh will stand a higher chance. If they are considering the market and high standard, Jolin will have a bigger chance to bag the big awards. Ugly Beauty is truly the most honest and high standard production album. GMA should also give justice to Jolin’s live singing skill (maybe through live performance). But, seems like the critics and juries love how meticulous Sandy’s voice and her album production are, so I think Sandy will still be the big winners of the night.\n\nReferences\n\n金曲30開戰前，讓我們聊聊蔡依林、孫盛希以及無法忽視的ØZI\n\n金曲30：大膽預測 ｜一起見證好音樂\n\n【金曲30】最佳國語專輯分析 蔡依林呼聲高有望成最大贏家\n\nJOLIN TSAI 蔡依林 – UGLY BEAUTY 怪美的 (2018)\n\n【金曲30專題】劃時代的鍍金榮耀\n\n金曲30｜倒數ing！重溫蔡依林、林憶蓮等5位準歌后入圍作品\n\nhttp://cityplusfm.my/goldenmelody30/\n\nGMA Edition:\n\nWhat is GMA?\n\nJolin & GMA 2000-2008\n\nJolin & GMA 2011-2016\n\nJolin GMA 2019\n\nGMA Edition:\n\nWhat is GMA?\n\nJolin & GMA 2000-2008\n\nJolin & GMA 2011-2016\n\nJolin GMA 2019\n\nJolin Tsai’s 10th studio album, Butterfly is her last best selling (sales figures) album in Taiwan as of now.

Inspired by the Greek goddess Muse, Jolin wanted to incorporate music and art in this album, “muse” also means inspiration. It received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising it a “pop masterpiece” and has the depth to reward repeated listens. The artistically-flavoured album houses track influenced by the elements of art, poetry, and dance. It sold for more than 10 thousand copies in Taiwan and made her getting the most selling female artist of 2012. In 24th Golden Melody Awards, Muse has been nominated for 4 categories and she earned her second GMA award after 2007.\n\nShe was the first to arrive at the red carpet because she wanted to prepare for her performance afterwards. She was wearing a blue dress with a mosaic print from Balmain Spring 2013 RTW matching Cartier jewelry.\n\nOne of the highlight of the night was Jolin Tsai performing The Great Artist with new arrangement. The title of the performance is Music I Surprise which fusing magic, art and music.\n\nJolin took away the Best Song of the Year category for the song The Great Artist. She was getting the award from Fan Fan and Fish Leong. “It’s so cool. Thank you all the fans who have supported this song. It’s unexpected that this song would have a great response from all of you. Thank you to my manager, Tom Wang, Ms Ke and the producer Michael Lin. My godd, it’s so exciting! Thank you Warner Music and hope you will see me on stage again later.”\n\nAfter Best Mandarin Female Singer category was presented and Sandy Lam won the category. Then, she presented Best Mandarin Male Singer award with her friend, Jay Chou. When Jay asked Jolin whether she’s sad, Jolin replied “a little”. The host of the night, Momoko Tao kept asking Jay Chou to give Jolin a hug but both of them were quite awkward. Jay said don’t be sad because he has used to it. He’s willing to present the award on stage because he get to walk on the stage at least. He also switched the topic by asking whether Jolin going to the gym. Jolin said yes and she praised Jay’s chest as well and asking him to flaunt it. Jay also invited Jolin to his gym room. As Jay was also the nominees, Jolin asked whether he is nervous. Eventually, Jolin and Jay presented the awards to Jam Hsiao.\n\nHer second outfit is from Alexander McQueen Spring 2013 RTW pairing with Cartier jewelries.\n\nBest Music Video\n\n陳奕仁 Muh Chen / 乾杯 Cheers 《第二人生(No where 末日版)》Second Round (No Where Edition)) (Mayday) – winner\n\n陳奕仁 Muh Chen / 大藝術家 The Great Artist 《Muse》(Jolin Tsai)\n\n陳奕仁 Muh Chen / Super Girl 愛無畏 《Super Girl 愛無畏》(Elva Hsiao)\n\n比爾賈 Bill Chia / 加大力度 Increase Power 《Moment》(Joey Yung)\n\n比爾賈 Bill Chia / 無言歌 Wordless Song 《蓋亞》Gaia (Sandy Lam)\n\n黃元成 Ken Huang, 陳奕瑞 Eric Chen / 歐拉拉呼呼 O La La Hu Hu 《有吉他的流行歌曲》Guitar (Crowd Lu)\n\nBest Mandarin Female Singer\n\n林憶蓮 Sandy Lam / 《蓋亞》Gaia – winner\n\n蔡依林 Jolin Tsai / 《Muse》\n\n盧凱彤 Ellen Loo / 《你安安靜靜地躲起來》You Hide Silently\n\n鄧紫棋 G.E.M. / 《Xposed》\n\n家家 Jia Jia / 《忘不記》Unforgettable\n\n徐佳瑩 Lala Hsu / 《理想人生》Ideal Life\n\nBest Mandarin Album\n\n《蓋亞》Gaia / 林憶蓮 Sandy Lam – winner\n\n《12新作》Opus 12 / 周杰倫 Jay Chou\n\n《貧民百萬歌星》Ghetto Superstar / MC HotDog\n\n《回到未來》Back to Wonderland / 方大同 Khalil Fong\n\n《Muse》 / 蔡依林 Jolin Tsai\n\nSong of the Year\n\n大藝術家 The Great Artist / 蔡依林 Jolin Tsai 《Muse》 – winner\n\n回味 Retrospection / 黃韻玲 Kay Huang 《永恆，承諾》Eternity, Promise\n\n無言歌 Wordless Song / 林憶蓮 Sandy Lam 《蓋亞》Gaia\n\n海岸線 Coastline / 陳永龍 Yonlon Chen 《海岸線》 Coastline\n\n玫瑰色的你 Rose-colored / 張懸 Deserts Chang 《神的遊戲》Games We Play\n\n2014 June 28\n\nAlthough Jolin didn’t release any albums during 2013, she was invited by GMA to perform again! As she just finished her Myself World Tour, this performance contained the essence of her last concert tour including outfit and music arrangement. The performance titled Queen of Stage really shows that she is the queen of the night. The song shows the transformation of Jolin Tsai from 1999-2012, each of the song represents every significant era of Jolin. It features the iconic segment which Jolin changed her outfit for every song. Joined with 72 dancers, the performance even showcases all of her Myself World Tour concert outfit.\n\nShe did not walk the red carpet this year because she was getting prepare for the performance.\n\nSetlist: I Know You’re Feeling Blue, Don’t Stop, Magic, J-game (Interlude), Dancing Diva, Agent J, Bravo Lover, Butterfly, Real Man, Honey Trap and The Great Artist.\n\nAfter that, she was presenting Best Mandarin Album with Mayday. The winner of the title is A-Yue’s I am Ayal Komod.\n\nShe was wearing cropped top and skirt from Emilio Pucci Spring 2014 RTW.\n\n2015 June 27\n\nJolin Tsai’s 13th studio album, PLAY was released on November 15, 2014. It set the highest bar for Chinese dance-pop music. It’s critically acclaimed and it has sold more than 85,000 copies in Taiwan. It made her the best-selling album by a female artist of 2014 in Taiwan. The album melds dancehall with bubblegum pop, breathtaking love songs with hilariously catty weirdness and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms. This album explores the pop culture influences on society, gender identity, feminism and also voice out for the LGBTQ+ community. As a result, she obtained 9 nominations from 26th Golden Melody Awards, 4 nominations are from the 2 same categories. Play and We’re All Different, Yet the same were nominated for Best Music Video whereas Play and Lip Reading have been nominated for Producer of the Year, Single. PLAY from Jolin Tsai is the most nominated album in 26th GMA.\n\nHowever, she was snubbed in the Best Mandarin Female Singer award and of the judges said that there is too much “voice adjustment” in this album. Jolin’s manager replied that Jolin doesn’t depend on voice adjustment, he welcomed everyone to watch her live performance at her concert.\n\nJolin wore a blue deep v-neck allover sequin gown from Lanvin Pre-Fall 2015, paired with Cartier jewelries and brooches. She said she is quite relax because she don’t have to perform. She was here to be the audience.\n\nThe host of the night, Harlem Yu was performing the medley of all the 2014 great hits. When Play was played, Jolin Tsai joined him on stage to perform the dance.\n\nJolin went on the stage several times to receive 2 awards, Best Vocal Recording Album and Producer of the Year, Single (on behalf of Andrew Chen).\n\nBest Vocal Recording Album speech:\n\n“It’s not easy. Thanks to all the team behind the scenes. Every album is an effort of a team. It’s not only me, every producer, recorder and song writer are my biggest pillars. Thank you, thank you Warner, thank you my fans and judges. Hope that I can come up again.”\n\nProducer of the Year, Single speech:\n\n“Thank you Andrew Chen, he gave me a lot of space when producing this song. Thank you for his nitpicking, for being professional and your guidance!!”\n\nWhen PLAY was announced as the Best Mandarin Album by Wang Leehom, Jolin shed a tear and she was very thrilled.\n\n“Omg. I thought the prediction from the newspaper will not be accurate. I never thought that a mainstream album is able to win the Best Album award, especially there’s so many dance-pop in the album. My team who’re behind the scenes has given me a lot of space, everyone spent their maximum effort to produce this album, everyone enjoys listening to music, and it’s very fun. It also convinces the judges that I’m able to produce the Best Album. I want to thank all the producers for each of the songs. Including Starr Chen who didn’t win, Nese Ni, Andrew Chen. Every producer let me learn a lot. Thank you so much for able to present my idea. Not forget the great director, Muh Chen and Hou Chi-jan. Also, thank you to Warner Music Record and Sam Chen for trusting me, I hope I didn’t disappoint anyone. I’m so happy! Thank you to my management company, thank you for trusting my intuition, allowing me to be myself, I’m happy and blooming when I’m being myself. Thanks to my family and friend. I won!!!”\n\nJolin was wearing jumpsuit from Balenciaga Fall 2015 RTW.\n\nBest Album Design\n\n聶永真Aaron Nieh / 《小湊戀歌》Enchantment – Winner\n\n聶永真 Aaron Nieh / 《呸》Play\n\n方序中 Joe Fang / 《偏執面》Faces of Paranoia\n\n羅文岑 Lo Wen-tsen, 蔡安騰 Tsai An-teng, 吳芝瑩 Wu Chih-yin / 《Ima Lalu Su 你叫什麼名字》(雲力思 Inka Mbing)\n\n徐昌國 (五子頭耗子) Howza Hsu / 《芬芳的山谷》Sweet Home Ka-Aluwan (胡德夫 Ara Kimbo)\n\n李仲強 Lee Chung-chiang / 《哎喲，不錯哦》Aiyo, Not Bad (USB version)\n\nSong of the Year\n\n島嶼天光（搖滾版） Island’s Sunrise (Original Version Re-mixed) / 滅火器樂團 Fire EX. 《島嶼天光》 Island’s Sunrise – Winner\n\nPlay 我呸 / 蔡依林 Jolin Tsai 《呸》Play\n\n尋人啟事 Missing (from Missing) / 徐佳瑩 Lala Hsu 《尋人啟事》\n\n用餘生去愛 The Rest of Time / 張學友 Jacky Cheung 《Wake Up Dreaming》\n\n偏執面 Faces of Paranoia / 張惠妹 aMEI, 蛋堡 Soft Lipa 《偏執面》Faces of Paranoia\n\nBest Music Arrangement\n\n佛跳牆 Buddha Jump / 給你看 Let You See《給你看》(佛跳牆 Buddha Jump ) – Winner\n\n陳星翰 Starr Chen, 倪子崗 Nese Ni / Play 我呸《呸》Play (蔡依林 Jolin Tsai )\n\n陳建騏 Chen Chien-chi / 尋人啟事 Missing《尋人啟事》(徐佳瑩 Lala Hsu)\n\n顧忠山 Lawrence Ku / 動人心扉 Touching Hearts《超越 To the Top》(順子 Shunza)\n\nPessi Levanto / 被遺忘的時光 Forgotten Times《午夜劇院》 Midnight Cinema (王若琳 Joanna Wang)\n\nBest Music Video\n\n黃中平 Shockley Huang / 在不確定的世界裡 Nebulous 《還是要相信愛情啊混蛋們》 You Lovely Bastard (魏如萱 Waa Wei) – Winner\n\n陳奕仁 Muh Chen / Play 我呸 《呸》Play (Jolin Tsai)\n\n侯季然 Hou Chi-jan / 不一樣又怎樣 We’re All Different, Yet the Same 《呸》Play (Jolin Tsai)\n\n李伯恩 Li Bo-en / 自拍 Selfie Addict 《XXXIII》(葛仲珊Miss Ko, 安心亞Amber An)\n\n鄧勇星 Teng Yung-shing, 席然 Xi Ran / 匆匆 In a Flash《匆匆》In a Flash (李劍青 Li Jian Qing)\n\nBest Vocal Recording Album\n\n《呸》Play / 蔡依林 Jolin Tsai – Winner\n\n《午夜劇院》 Midnight Cinema / 王若琳 Joanna Wang\n\n《危險世界》Dangerous World / 方大同 Khalil Fong\n\n《不散，不見》Departures / 莫文蔚 Karen Mok\n\n《波利尼西亞》 Polynesia / 查勞巴西瓦里 Chalaw Pasiwali\n\nProducer of the Year, Single\n\n小安 Andrew Chen / 唇語 Lip Reading《呸》Play (蔡依林 Jolin Tsai ) – Winner\n\n陳星翰 Starr Chen / Play 我呸《呸》Play (蔡依林 Jolin Tsai )\n\n林俊傑 JJ Lin / 你給我聽好 Listen Up《米·閃》Rice & Shine (陳奕迅 Eason Chan)\n\n孫燕姿 Stefanie Sun / 克卜勒 Kepler 《克卜勒》Kepler (孫燕姿 Stefanie Sun)\n\n小安 Andrew Chen (BADTONE PRODUCTION) / 上流玩法 Sophisticated Game 《大人情歌》 Grown Love (Eve Ai 艾怡良)\n\nBest Mandarin Album\n\n《呸》Play / 蔡依林 Jolin Tsai – Winner\n\n《尋人啟事》Missing / 徐佳瑩 Lala Hsu\n\n《Wake Up Dreaming》 / 張學友 Jacky Cheung\n\n《米·閃》Rice & Shine / 陳奕迅 Eason Chan\n\n《哎喲，不錯哦》Aiyo, Not Bad / 周杰倫 Jay Chou\n\n《不散，不見》Departures / 莫文蔚 Karen Mok\n\n2016 June 25\n\nI’m Not Yours music video is nominated for Best Music Video and the luck is not on Jolin’s side again. This is the 5th time Jolin Tsai get nominated for Best Music Video and still not able to win the award. Jolin Tsai was at the 27th GMA to present the Best Mandarin Female Singer award. She surprised the nominees by pushing a tray cart with 6 fondant cakes on top. The GMA trophy lookalike fondant cakes were made by her and her fondant baking team, Your Majesty. All 6 nominees have their trophy made by fondant and aMei accidentally broke the cake. Then Jolin walked up to the stage to present the award. Among the 6 nominees, 3 of them are her close friend, aMei, Tanya Chua (I) and Peggy Hsu (Wandering Poet, Dr Jolin). At last, she presented the awards to Julia Peng.\n\nJolin’s gorgeous gown was from Ralph Lauren Spring 2016 RTW.\n\nBest Music Video\n\n談宗藩 Tan Tsung-fan / 如同悲傷被下載了兩次 As If Sorrow Has Been Downloaded Twice《如同悲傷被下載了兩次》(Sandee Chan) – Winner\n\n陳奕仁 Muh Chen / I’m Not Yours 《呸》Play (Jolin Tsai)\n\n蘇建益 Su Chien-i / 盛夏光年 Eternal Summer《步步自選作品集 The Best of 1999-2013》 (Mayday)\n\n劉耕名 Liu Keng-ming / I Am Alive《新地球》Brave New World (JJ Lin feat.

Golden Melody Awards aka GMA is the most prestigious music awards in Chinese pop music industry, it is also known as the Cpop Grammys. (Click here to have a basic intro about Golden Melody Awards.)\n\nFor your record, Jolin Tsai has been awarded 4 Golden Melody Awards trophies which are 2 Song of the Year awards, 1 Best Mandarin Female Singer and 1 Album of the Year. It made her the “dance-pop singer” with the most Golden Melody Award trophies received. In 2016, her album PLAY set the record for the most Golden Melody Awards nominations (ten nominations), leading to a tie with other singers including Jay Chou’s Fantasy (2001) and aMei’s Amit (2009).\n\nIt’s never easy to “compete” with other top artists to get the GMA recognition. Sometimes, the controversies/gossips that sparked after the ceremony will make the audience lose focus on the music itself. I think there is a love-hate relationship between Jolin Tsai and the Golden Melody Awards. During 29 years of GMA, Jolin Tsai has given us several iconic performances on the GMA stage and her hard works are being recognised as well. However, there is also some backlash and even “hates” that she has gained after the night of the award ceremony. These ‘bad experience’ definitely shatter her confidence and might haunt her for several years but she overcomes it like a boss. In her latest album Ugly Beauty, there is a song which is related to her GMA experience. In Ugly Beauty music video, there is also a scene which throwback to her GMA moment. Debuted in 1999, Jolin has been participating GMA since 2000. Participating Golden Melody Awards is more than just walking on the red carpet and getting awards, especially for Jolin.\n\n2000 11th Golden Melody Awards\n\nThis is Jolin’s first time attending Golden Melody Awards. She walked the red carpet with actor and singer, Cecilia Cheung and Daniel Chan. Jolin also presented awards with singer Where Chou and popular host/singer, Hsueh-Liang Pu.\n\n2003 August 2 14th Golden Melody Awards\n\nOn March 2003, Jolin Tsai released her fifth studio album Magic after her contract issue. It’s a huge comeback because this album shows the biggest transition in her music career. The album contains a lot of dance-pop music and people start to label her as the “dance pop singer”.\n\nDue to the SARS outbreak, GMA was postponed from May 3rd to August 2nd. Jolin Tsai was invited to perform and present the awards during the ceremony. She was wearing a Dior Fall 2003 RTW short black dress and carrying a white Dior saddle bag.\n\nShe was accompanied by Harlem Yu to walk the red carpet. She mentioned that her costume is specially made which helped her to change to another outfit real quick, hoping to surprise the audience. Her performance of the night is titled, “Watch her 72 Changes” and you can see a hint of Butterfly. The setlist was Magic (72 Changes).\n\nAfter performing, she was presenting the Best New Artist award with popular host and singer, Jacky Wu. She presented the award to the winner, Evonne Hsu.\n\n2004 May 8 15th Golden Melody Awards\n\nOn March 2nd, Jolin has released her sixth studio album, Castle. In the same year, her album Magic was nominated for 3 awards including Best Mandarin Album, Best Mandarin Female Singer and Best Arranger in 15th Golden Melody Awards. Magic has won the Best Arranger award with Prague Square arranged by Baby Chung.\n\nJolin Tsai walked the red carpet with her bestie Show Lo. She was wearing a green dress by Prada Spring 2004 RTW. She was very nervous and it was nice to be accompanied by her close friend.\n\nThat night, her other task is to present the award with special guest, 今井翼 Tsubasa Imai. The award that they’re presenting Lyricist of the Year (Traditional) and Lyricist of the Year (Pop).\n\nWhen Baby Chung was announced as the winner of Best Arranger, Jolin Tsai went to the stage to get the award on behalf of Baby Chung because he was absent. But she made a mistake when she was saying the thank you speech, she spoke the wrong name Yao Hung instead of Baby Chung. Before the Best Mandarin Female Singer was presented, Jolin Tsai had a chance to make up her mistake by thanking Baby Chung again. She also said that she was quite chill when being asked by the host about her feelings.\n\nNominations:\n\nBest Arranger\n\nBaby Chung 鍾興民 – 布拉格廣場 Prague Square (《看我72變》Magic by Jolin Tsai) – Winner\n\nLiu Shau Xi 劉劭希 – 地狱浮沉录 ( 《八方来客》 by Liu Shau Xi )\n\nHai Lin 林海 – 空城 Desolate City (《將愛》 To Love by Faye Wong)\n\nZhang Yadong 張亞東 – 不留 Leave Nothing ( 《將愛》 To Love by Faye Wong)\n\nYao Hung 洪敬堯 – 以父之名 In the Name of Father (《葉惠美》Yeh Hui-mei by Jay Chou)\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\n《葉惠美》Yeh Hui-mei by Jay Chou – Winner\n\n《看我72變》Magic by Jolin Tsai\n\n《將愛》To Love by Faye Wong\n\n《一儕·花樹下》by Hsieh Yu-Wei 謝宇威\n\n《風吹的願望》 by Jody Chiang 江蕙\n\nBest Mandarin Female Singer\n\nFaye Wong 王菲 – 《將愛》To Love – Winner\n\nJolin Tsai 蔡依林 – 《看我72變》Magic\n\nPenny Tai 戴佩妮 – 《No Penn, No Gain》\n\nTanya Chua 蔡健雅 – 《陌生人》Stranger\n\nFish Leong 梁靜茹 – 《美麗人生》Beautiful Life\n\nDuring the first round of voting, Jolin Tsai and Tanya Chua have been eliminated. In the second round of voting, Faye Wong received 9 votes, Fish Leong received 8 votes and Penny Tai received 2 votes. Because no one has exceeded half of the total number of the votes, so there is a third round of voting. Faye Wong has received landslide victory in the third round of voting.\n\n2007 June 16 18th Golden Melody Awards\n\nIt has been 3 years since her last GMA nomination and participation. Although Castle and J-Game helped her to become the best-selling album by a female artist of the year in Taiwan, the 2 albums didn’t get any recognition from the GMA juries. Dancing Diva was not only the best-selling album of the year in Taiwan, it also helped Jolin Tsai to earn her two Golden Melody Award nominations for Best Mandarin Album and Best Mandarin Female Singer, and she finally won the Best Mandarin Female Singer award!\n\nJolin Tsai has received 4 awards that night, 2 Golden Melody Official Awards and another 2 unofficial awards which are Golden Melody Caller Tune Singer awards and she has been voted as the Most Popular Female Singer (Group) by the audience.\n\nJolin Tsai attended 18th Golden Melody Awards in a Versace Spring 2007 RTW Fish Scales Dress and Bvlgari jewellery. She said that she is very nervous because she was opening the show. She was concerning about the performance as it involved fire shows. She said she will feel better after finishing the show. She did not prepare for the thank you speech because she thought the speech was never used when it’s prepared. She also revealed that she was wearing red underwear for good luck.\n\nJolin Tsai opened the Golden Melody Awards by performing Dancing Diva. The performance included tribal elements and also gymnastic movements. Although she was lip-syncing during the performance, she still gave us a visually stunning performance.\n\nJolin Tsai was the first place in the Most Popular Female Singer (Group) category, her total votes have surpassed S.H.E (Second place) and Fish Leong (3rd place). This unofficial GMA award was selected by the audience. Audience can vote for their favourite artist through online and SMS. She has received a total 92,762 votes, 89,269 votes are online, 3,493 votes are from SMS. Jolin received the award from her best friend, Show Lo and Japanese singer-songwriter Mai Kuraki.\n\nThe first official GMA award that Jolin has won that night was Best Song of the Year for Marry Me Today. Marry Me Today featuring Jolin Tsai was released in David Tao’s album, Beautiful.\n\nThen Jolin presented Best Mandarin Male Singer award with singer-songwriter WuBai. WuBai has released his song, You’re My Flower which features a dance. Both of them were performing the dance on the stage before presenting the award. Finally, they presented the Best Mandarin Male Singer to Nicky Lee.\n\nOne of the highlights of the night is when The legendary pop band, The Wynners announcing the winner of Best Mandarin female artist. There are 6 nominees in the category, all of them are popular and have several hits. Jolin Tsai won her first Golden Melody Award. She is a GMA winner!\n\nHer second outfit of the day is from Dolce & Gabanna SS2007.\n\nNominations\n\nProducer of the Year, Single\n\nJay Chou 周杰倫 – 《霍元甲》Huo Yuan Jia （Fearless by Jay Chou）- Winner\n\nAdia 阿弟仔 – 《舞孃》Dancing Diva （Dancing Diva by Jolin Tsai）\n\nHigher Band 亥兒樂隊, Zhu Jian Hui 朱劍輝 – 《炎黃子孫》Yan Huang Zisun （ Yan Huang Zisun by Higher Band ）\n\nBest Mandarin Album\n\n《Wake Up》 – MC HotDog 熱狗 – Winner\n\n《舞孃》 Dancing Diva – Jolin Tsai\n\n《Blue in love》 – Hao-en and Jiajia 昊恩家家\n\n《My Life Will…》 – Deserts Chang 張懸\n\n《小宇宙》Little Universe – Sodagreen 蘇打綠\n\n《浪費時間快樂的 All I want》 – Joystna Peng 彭靖惠\n\nBest Song of the Year\n\n今天你要嫁給我 Marry Me Today – David Tao & Jolin Tsai,《太美麗》Beautiful – winner\n\n種樹 Planting Trees – Lin Sheng Xiang 林生祥,《 種樹 》Planting Trees\n\n千里之外 Far Away – Jay Chou 周杰倫,《依然范特西》 Still Fantasy\n\n小情歌 Little Love Song – Sodagreen 蘇打綠,《小宇宙》Little Universe\n\n寶貝(in the night) Baby(in the night) – Deserts Chang 張懸 ,《My Life Will…》\n\n天下大同 Same World – Karen Mok 莫文蔚,《 如果沒有你 》 Without You\n\nMini Commentary:\n\nPlanting Trees is a Hakka song dedicated to Taiwan Farming Association. The whole album helps to raise awareness about the farming industry and also the farmers. It’s a Hakka new folk, the arrangement is simple but the song is calm and touching. Usually, this kind of song with a meaningful background will win the category. Although the song didn’t win this category, it helped Lin Sheng Xiang win the Best Lyricist, Best Hakka Singer and Best Hakka Album. However, Lin refused to accept the trophy (but he accepted the award money and he promised that he would donate the money to the farming industry) and this cause the first controversy of the night. Everyone tended to doubt that why a wedding song can beat other hits like Far Away, Baby and Little Love Song. Little Love Song is like the karaoke song (ballad) of the year. Far Away by Jay Chou featuring the legendary singer Fei Yu-ching will forever be the classic collaboration between a pop singer and a legendary(senior) singer. No doubt that Marry Me Today is the popular wedding song for several years (like Ed Sheeran’s Perfect?).\n\nBest Mandarin Female Singer\n\nJolin Tsai 蔡依林 – 《舞孃》 Dancing Diva – Winner\n\nSandy Lam 林憶蓮 – 《呼吸》Breathe Me\n\naMei Chang 張惠妹 – 《 我要快樂 》 I Want Happiness\n\nPenny Tai 戴佩妮 – 《 ipenny 》\n\nAngela Chang 張韶涵 – 《潘朵拉》 Pandora\n\nJoystna Peng 彭靖惠 – 《浪費時間快樂的 All I want》\n\nThere’re altogether 3 rounds of voting. During the first and second round, the number of votes is a deadlock between aMei and Sandy Lam. In the last round, it’s the fight between Jolin Tsai and Penny Tai. Eventually, Jolin received the recognition from 2/3 of judges.\n\nControversies\n\n1. Leak\n\n18th Golden Melody Awards is the most disastrous in its history because there is a serious result leak right before the awards ceremony. Around 7pm, the complete list of winners has been revealed. As a result, some of the nominees were acting calmly like nothing happen even though they knew that they are not the winners. Some other nominees even left the ceremony since they know they lost. According to the news, aMei has been told by her assistant that she lost before the category is revealed and she was forced to act naturally. When Jolin was being accused that she already knew the result just because her thank you speech is flawless, Jolin’s manager, Chiang said that he never inform Jolin because she didn’t know how to act. Furthermore, she was saying aMei’s name before the winner was announced. Her speech was good because that’s her heartfelt words. Of course, haters gonna hate, they said that Jolin’s reaction to her win is so fake.\n\n2. Lipsync\n\nLip-sync used to be a big no-no in the Cpop industry unless it’s necessary. Jolin was lip-syncing during her opening performance and it receives complain and backlash from the netizens. Her manager replied that the performance involved fire and the smokes were choking even during the rehearsal. Eventually, it’s decided to let Jolin lip-sync. When she was tumbling, it might affect the ear monitor to play the sound. Netizens responded that Jolin should’ve put singing as her priority since it’s a singing awards ceremony and not circus.\n\n3. Her win\n\nAnother controversy of the night will be Jolin Tsai winning Best Mandarin Female Singer Awards. Fans of other nominees started doubting her win and things got worse when the netizens bashing her in PTT (Taiwan’s Reddit) saying that, “how Jolin Tsai can beat aMei and Sandy?”. The next day, the media described her win as an unexpected win. Labels started flowing in like “the gymnast won the best singer” and “the best singer lip-synced in the awards ceremony”. Her win at this year’s GMA has been one of the reasons when people wanted to criticize this award ceremony. For some of the audience and critics, her win represents that GMA started losing its prestige and fairness.\n\nWhen her manager was being asked whether Jolin Tsai is qualified to win the Best Mandarin Female Singer even though she was lip-syncing, her manager answered that everyone can see her improvement during the concert, she is a hardworking artist. The smoke during the performance and the dance moves would affect her performance, so it’s a special situation here. The comment given by the judges is that Jolin Tsai is a visionary singer, her works are very active, diverse and the skills are smooth. Her biggest competitor is Penny Tai but her latest work is not as good as her past which is why Jolin Tsai won the awards. The judges also praised that she is smart and agile, able to sing and dance which make her leading. The content of Dancing Diva is diverse which makes her breaking the borders of an artist and become a real singer. She wins because of her multifacetedness. As the music platform is changing, music download is trending, she is keeping up with the trend. A critic criticized the judges that they have different standards on different categories. The critic added that one of the reasons that Jolin won the category is because she is multifaceted, but ain’t aMei is multifaceted as well? “Cirque du Soleil is multifaceted too”, the critic added.\n\naMei responded that everyone should recognise Jolin’s strength, and also the other nominees’. She’s sad that she didn’t win and she’d try again next year. She also showed up at Jolin’s appreciation party after the ceremony. aMei’s manager Isaac Chen (he has written lyrics for Jolin’s 22 songs) said that aMei already knew she won’t win the prize. He responded that the judges have different standards every year, Jolin is the most popular idol now. If the judges are using this perspective to recognise the singer’s hard work, it’s a glorious defeat for aMei. Angela Chang congratulated on Jolin’s win although she was rooting for aMei. She said that Jolin is a hardworking singer and everyone has their own strength.\n\nApparently, most of the people were rooting for aMei’s win that night. Jolin was being treated as an “idol singer” and her vocal can’t beat the other 2 legendary singers. All the nominees are great and each of their albums is excellent and significant. Among the nominees, Joystna is not the mainstream singer, both her and Jolin were from the same singing contest organised by MTV, Jolin won the first place and Joystna was runner-up. All I Want is Joystna’s first Jazz album, before that she was singing ballad pop song. Angela Chang’s Pandora features a “national anthem” called “Invisible Wings”, this song is a hit at all the Chinese-speaking countries. Sandy Lam debuted in 1985, Breath Me was her 29th studio album (10th Mandarin Album). aMei Chang‘s I Want Happiness is her 13th album and it features jams like Hostage and I Want Happiness. This album has received big success in terms of sales and reputation. Penny Tai composes her own song and all the albums that she has released are purely written by her including lyrics and song. In my opinion, I think “breakthrough” is the key word of Jolin’s win. Besides luck, Jolin has a major leap compared to the other nominees. Dancing Diva is her biggest improvement since Magic, this album proves that she is not only a singer, she is also a performer and an artist.\n\nIt’s quite unfair because she has to suffer all the bullying just because she accepted an award given by a group of juries. It feels terrible when there’s someone who doesn’t think you deserve an award. We wouldn’t understand how suffering it is for Jolin to take all these into the heart. She never reveals any of her feelings about all these negativity. Even during her Myself concert, she confessed to her fans with a smile but the tears never stop.\n\n*On 2018 April 11, she reposted this video and wrote down the status below on her Weibo.\n\n“Looking back at the different stages of myself, I might be concerning too much about winning or losing, overexerting myself, closing myself off, looking down on myself. But, every moment that has been recorded show the real situation that I’ve been through. I hope that one day I can quietly smile at that silly stubbornness and resentment of my old self and then feel jubilant and say “how wonderful isn’t it”. It’s like a dream. Don’t be afraid, don’t need to hide, it’s still a gem regardless of good or bad. If you’re overpowered (spending too much effort) on doing something, it’s time to let go! “\n\nIn Ugly Beauty album, the last song titled, Shadow Self includes short audio from 18th Golden Melody Award. It shows the moment when The Wynners announcing the winner of Best Mandarin Female Singer. This song talks about facing your dark side introduced by Carl Jung.\n\n2008 July 5th 19th Golden Melody Awards\n\nIn July 2007, Jolin released her ninth studio album, Agent J , it features several hits including Sun Will Never Set, Agent J and Bravo Lover. It sold more than 200,000 copies sold in Taiwan alone. It’s critics acclaimed because it’s nominated for 2 categories in 19th Golden Melody Awards . Jolin Tsai was the final one walking on the red carpet. She was wearing a dress from Giambattista Valli SS08.\n\nThe opening of the night featured a parody by the hosts. Barbie Hsu was mimicking Jolin’s iconic “Dancing Forever World Tour” outfit.\n\nAgent J received the first award for Best Arranger. The award was received by the arranger Andrew Chen (小安).\n\nThat night, Agent J won its second award which is Producer of the Year, Single. Adia won this category for producing Agent J.\n\nJolin was presenting the Best Mandarin Female Singer with the Bad Day Singer, Daniel Powter. He complimented her for her talent and performance.\n\nJolin’s second outfit was from Lanvin Fall 2008.\n\nNominations:\n\nBest Arrangement\n\nAndrew Chen 小安 – Agent J 特務J (《特務J》Agent J by Jolin Tsai) – Winner\n\nChen Chien-chi 陳建騏 – j’Adore 崇拜, (《崇拜》j’Adore by Fish Leong)\n\nBaby Chung 鍾興民 – Blue and White Porcelain 青花瓷, (《我很忙》On the Run by Jay Chou 周杰倫)\n\nHuang Chung-yueh 黃中岳 – Darwin 達爾文, (《Goodbye & Hello》by Tanya Chua蔡健雅)\n\nMartin Tang – Against the Light 逆光, (《逆光》Against the Light by Stefanie Sun孫燕姿)\n\nMichael Tu 涂惠源 – Wake-up Song 起床歌 (《Super Sunshine》by Gary Chaw曹格)\n\nQing Feng Wu吳青峰, Wei史俊威, Claire Hsieh謝馨儀, Kay Liu 劉家凱, A-Fu何景揚, Zephyr龔鈺祺, Will Lin 林暐哲 – Incomparable Beauty 無與倫比的美麗 (《無與倫比的美麗》Incomparable Beauty by Sodagreen蘇打綠)\n\nProducer of the Year, Single\n\nAdia 阿弟仔 – Agent J 特務J (《特務J》Agent J by Jolin Tsai) – Winner\n\nChen Chien-liang 陳建良 – Fool 傻瓜, (《熱浪》Hot Wave by 溫嵐Landy Wen)\n\nTiger Chung 鍾成虎 – Pussy, (《Track 4》 by 陳綺貞Cheer Chen)\n\nMa Yufen 馬毓芬 – A Moment 一眼瞬間 (《STAR》by 張惠妹aMei & 蕭敬騰Jam Hsiao)\n\nTank – Counterterrorism 反恐小組, (《延长比赛 keep Fighting》by Tank 呂建中)\n\nFuss\n\nThis is not supposed to happen at all.\n\nJolin Tsai’s red carpet outfit stole some highlights and attention when she attended the red carpet wearing Giambattista Valli SS08 ruffle dress. The dress was described as cuttlefish and sanitary pad by the netizens, bloggers and media. Since then, her outfit and her fashion taste have become the subject to tease and mock her for years. This outfit also contributes to one of her nickname, Queen of Seafood.\n\nJolin’s Giambattista Valli dress was selected by Club Designer Taiwan founder and her daughter Miss Yi. Miss Yi said that the ruffle is very GV style, the pink colour is the trendy colour, the outfit suits Jolin’s age and image. She wanted Jolin to look young in a formal occasion. Everyone can have their own opinion, but a good design will still be appreciated by someone who knows and loves the design.\n\nAccording to Vogue Taiwan and her stylist 小倫, Jolin’s outfit was selected out of 10 brands and was being “approved/verified” by the record label. She tried everything and all of them think that she looks the best in the dress. They wanted Jolin to wear a fresh brand instead of wearing a well-known brand. She added that everyone overlooks the bold colour of the dress and its elegant cutting, it actually fits Jolin’s “contrasting/clashing” character.\n\nAfter 10 years, Jolin mocked herself again by appearing in the music video wearing the same outfit. During the interview at Ugly Beauty conference, she said that everyone seems to be pretty strict on her, she also doesn’t understand what mistake the outfit has done. She added,” It has been 10 years, I hope that I’m carrying it better than last time.”\n\nThis is the first 10 years of her participating Golden Melody Awards. The next post will be covering her GMA involvement from 2010 – 2016.\n\nTo end this part, I’d like to quote the last line of Dancing Diva’s lyrics, “Blurring the years and ages, no one has seen the happiness and sadness of a dancing diva”.\n\nGMA Edition:\n\nWhat is GMA?\n\nJolin & GMA 2000-2008\n\nJolin & GMA 2011-2016\n\nJolin GMA 2019\n\n金曲獎/Golden Melody Award (GMA) is the most prestigious music award in the Chinese-speaking world. 2019 is the 30th anniversary of GMA and the nomination for this year has been released. This is a post to let you understand more about the Golden Melody Award and sharing Jolin Tsai’s moment with GMA.\n\n*This post will be covering GMA. To check out Jolin Tsai’s GMA journey, click here.\n\nWhat is Chinese pop aka C-pop?\n\nBefore that, I’d like to tell you the meanings of Chinese.\n\nIn terms of nationality, it means the citizens of PRC.\n\nIn terms of ethnic, it means a group of people sharing the Chinese culture but their nationality might not be Chinese. For instance, Wang Leehom is a Chinese-American, Gemma Chan is British and Michelle Yeoh is Malaysian.\n\nIn terms of language, it means the spoken language by the Chinese ethnics. Here are some of the Chinese language.\n\nMandarin\n\nCantonese (mainly spoken by the people from Hong Kong, Macau, Guangdong and Malaysia)\n\nTaiwanese/Hokkien (mainly spoken by the people from Taiwan, Fujian and Malaysia)\n\nHakka\n\nAccording to Wiki, C-pop is a loosely defined musical genre by artists originating from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and countries where the Chinese language is used by a large number of the population, such as Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe 3 main subgenres of C-pop are Mandopop, Cantopop & Taiwanese pop.\n\nWhat is Golden Melody Awards?\n\nGMA is an honour awarded by the Ministry of Culture of Taiwan to recognize outstanding achievement in the Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, and Taiwanese Indigenous Language popular and traditional music industry. We are going to focus on the popular music industry.\n\nPopular music categories include\n\nVocal Category\n\nPublishing Awards\n\nAlbum of the Year (年度專輯獎)\n\nSong of the Year (年度歌曲獎)\n\nBest Mandarin Album (最佳國語專輯獎)\n\nBest Taiwanese Album (最佳台語專輯獎)\n\nBest Hakka Album (最佳客語專輯獎)\n\nBest Aboriginal Album (最佳原住民語專輯獎)\n\nBest Music Video (最佳音樂錄影帶獎)\n\nIndividual Awards\n\nBest Composition (最佳作曲人獎)\n\nBest Lyrics (最佳作詞人獎)\n\nBest Music Arrangement (最佳編曲人獎)\n\nProducer of the Year, Album (最佳專輯製作人獎)\n\nProducer of the Year, Single (最佳單曲製作人獎)\n\nBest Mandarin Male Singer (最佳國語男歌手獎)\n\nBest Mandarin Female Singer (最佳國語女歌手獎)\n\nBest Taiwanese Male Singer (最佳台語男歌手獎)\n\nBest Taiwanese Female Singer (最佳台語女歌手獎)\n\nBest Hakka Singer (最佳客語歌手獎)\n\nBest Aboriginal Singer (最佳原住民語歌手獎)\n\nBest Band (最佳樂團獎)\n\nBest Vocal Group (最佳演唱組合獎)\n\nBest New Artist (最佳新人獎)\n\nInstrumental Category\n\nPublishing Awards\n\nBest Instrumental Album (最佳專輯獎)\n\nIndividual Awards\n\nProducer of the Year, Instrumental (最佳專輯製作人獎)\n\nBest Instrumental Composition (最佳作曲人獎)\n\nTechnical Category\n\nPublishing Awards\n\nBest Vocal Recording Album (最佳演唱錄音專輯獎)\n\nBest Instrumental Recording Album (最佳演奏錄音專輯獎)\n\nIndividual Awards\n\nBest Album Design (最佳專輯裝幀設計獎)\n\nSpecial Awards\n\nSpecial Contribution Award (特別貢獻獎)\n\nJury Award (評審團獎)\n\nThe numbers and types of awards have been amended and “improvised” throughout the years. To get GMA nominations, the music companies are required to submit their entries. Usually, they will have a month to apply and the works for submission should be released from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nJury\n\nThe juries are invited by the Ministry of Culture of Taiwan to select the winners every year. The juries are formed by 1 Grand jury, first review committees, second review committees and also juries for specific categories including album recording, music video and album design. The juries include musicians, radio announcers, music producers, composers, music critics, scholars and artists. Music video awards juries are mainly director, scriptwriter and film producer whereas the juries for album design involved illustrator, art directors, university professors and other art industry related professionals. They decide the number of nominations for each award. The juries involved are different every year.\n\nControversies\n\nThere has been a critic since the first GMA that the nominees and winners are disjointed with the music market. The juries’ standard and criteria always become the hot topic after the nomination is revealed. The “commercial” artists or idols are mostly not nominated for the award. Some said the juries always ignore music genres like dance-pop and hip hop. The performance of the sales chart, the number of music streaming and video views count do not reflect on the number of GMA nomination. To preserve its fairness, GMA has been referencing international music awards like Grammys and AMA.\n\nThe most criticized part is the GMA awards are being divided according to language. GMA awards are being categorised into Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka and Indigenous (no Cantonese) instead of categorising music award into genres like pop, hip hop, jazz, rock and others. This also means that Rock will need to fight with Hip Hop and Pop to win the awards under the same language. Take 2019 nomination as an example, eason and the duo band released an album titled, L.O.V.E. The album contains 8 Cantonese songs, 2 Mandarin songs, 1 English songs and 3 instrumentals. Thus the album can only be nominated for the awards that are not categorised by language like Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Producer of the Year (Album). His album will need to have 6 Mandarin songs to get nominated for Best Mandarin Male Singer and Best Mandarin Album.\n\nThat being said, Golden Melody Awards status in the C-pop industry is unshakable because of its “fairness” and effort in encouraging young talented artists. Unlike the other awards show, the prize or recognition cannot be “bought” and there is no “giant corporation” behind the scenes involved in deciding the winners. There is no “distribution system” like everybody got a slice of the cake. For some award show, the artists who have attended the award ceremony will get at least 1 award or there will be at least 1 winner from each of the music companies. The winners are not selected not based on the chart, selling, views nor popularity, everything was judged based on the albums and songs that are presented by the artists.\n\nEvery year, when the nominees are announced, most of the people will be like wtf because half of the nominees are not well known or they never heard before [insert Mariah Carey’s I don’t know her memes]. It’s because the judges/juries do not focus solely on “popularity” which help the music lovers to find the gems (less popular talented artists). Golden Melody Awards has become a platform to let the new artists shine and become “more mainstream”. Ronghao Li and No Party for Cao Dong are the examples. Besides the performer, GMA also recognises the hard work of those who work behind the scene by including the technical awards.\n\nIn C-pop scene, there’s a saying, the singers/artists can be divided into 3 types,\n\nCapable: Not necessary a songwriter, but definitely a good singer with strong vocal, a songbird. [Celine Dion, Whitney Houston]\n\nComposer: Multitalent, compose and produce their own music, sings well too. [Amy Winehouse, Sia]\n\nIdol: Visually appealing and entertaining, not necessary to have a nice vocal but they dance and perform well, performance always has choreography. [Britney Spears, J.Lo]\n\nGMA is always more favourable to the “Capable” type and “Composer” type. The juries enhance on the concept, production, depth and skills.\n\nThere will be different juries every year. So, the opinions, reasons and perspective in choosing the winners changes every year, the music taste are also different every year. 1 year they are promoting talented indie music and another year they will encourage mainstream music. Despite the controversies, Golden Melody Awards never bow down to the mainstream market and it always put the music first, it’s still the highest music recognition in the C-pop scene.\n\n“During the past 29 years, the award categories have gone through various changes which correspond to the flux of shifting music genres and the socio-political situation. Currently, the Awards are set to acknowledge the outstanding achievement of the singers, producers, albums, as well as songwriters across various lingual categories, such as Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, and Formosan-languages, in popular and traditional music. Even though assigning some of the award categories according to languages rather than music genres has been strongly criticised by some artists and the public, it is also clear that the Awards carefully seek to encourage musicians who exhibit the richness of their linguistic and cultural heritage in music, outside of Mandarin popular music (Mandopop).”\n\n——————by Chen-Yu Lin\n\nThe cover of GMA is incomplete, I will try to attach more English articles about GMA in the future if I found any.
