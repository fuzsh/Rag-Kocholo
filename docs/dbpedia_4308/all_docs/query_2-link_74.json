        "text": "I mean I haven't preferred any Taylor's Versions over the originals so I should've not gotten my hopes up, but 1989 is my favorite Pop album of hers so I had high hopes. I only listened to I Know Places and Blank Space (and a couple of from the vault songs) but the problem with these versions in general is that the production sounds way too \"clean\". Idk how to put it into words. It's like technically less compressed sounding and instruments are more prominent in the mix, but as a result certain components overpower other more iconic components or subtle components that I loved from the original.\n\nOddly enough though songs I disliked in the past, I dislike less with the newer recordings.\n\nAlso she needs to stop collaborating with Jack Antonoff. His production style is so distinctive in a bad way.\n\nHave any other artists rerecorded all their stuff again like this? I know she's doing it so she owns the rights to her own music, but it's also an incredibly interesting experiment to me.\n\nThere's a Taiwanese band called Sodagreen who is doing the same thing for all their albums. It's the same old story. The band left their original company and it was supposed to be amicable. The band decided to take a break to pursue their own interests. When the lead singer started singing again he got sued for doing work outside of their agreed contract. The exboss claimed that the lead singer did not end his contract with the company, a fact that was disputed by the ex-boss's lawyer, who witnessed the exchange. He was also sued for singing his old songs that he and his band wrote because his ex company owns the rights to the recordings. The band tried to make a comeback and the ex-company said the company registered and owns the name Sodagreen, even though the band has been using the name since they were an unsigned indie band in university.\n\nSo they changed their band's name to Oaeen and started recording all their own albums, Taylor Swift style (vault sings and all). Instead of Taylor's version, their rerecorded songs are called fish's version, after their new Chinese name 鱼丁糸, where the first word means fish.\n\nRecently their exboss decided to stop pursuing the lawsuit and they have settled their differences. They ended up rerecording 4 of their old albums and I don't know if they'll do the remaining 6 or so albums.\n\nDon't know a lot about her songs, but listened to Shake it off and couldn't tell an obvious difference. Any pointers ?\n\nHer voice is fairly different in the new one. It does sound a bit more processed but it fits the new arrangement.\n\nI'm not a Taylor Swift fan at all. But I do find the whole thing fanscinating from an experimental point of view. For example, live performances are meant to be varied and fluid, but when it comes to a studio recording, especially in pop music where everyone subconsciously knows every adlib, intonation, instrument and etc, recreating all of that to the satisfactory of fans has to be extremely difficult.\n\nI almost wish I was a Taylor Swift fan or was more familiar with her music, so I could analyze this experiment myself. I only know Blank Space and Shake it off, but probably not enough to notice any differences unless it was really dramatic.\n\nAlso Swift is probably doing these re-recordings at the right time when she can vocally still recreate most of the performances. If you wait too long, your voice might get raspy or unable to hit high notes. Not gonna lie though, if Mariah Carey wanted to re-record her earlier albums, I still would want to listen to those just to see how the studio performance changes. Hero (Mimi's version)\n\nI mean I haven't preferred any Taylor's Versions over the originals so I should've not gotten my hopes up, but 1989 is my favorite Pop album of hers so I had high hopes. I only listened to I Know Places and Blank Space (and a couple of from the vault songs) but the problem with these versions in general is that the production sounds way too \"clean\". Idk how to put it into words. It's like technically less compressed sounding and instruments are more prominent in the mix, but as a result certain components overpower other more iconic components or subtle components that I loved from the original.\n\nOddly enough though songs I disliked in the past, I dislike less with the newer recordings.\n\nAlso she needs to stop collaborating with Jack Antonoff. His production style is so distinctive in a bad way.\n\nI was going to post pretty much the same thing. The thing I don't like is that they clearly changed some of the instruments / samples; and while I'm in general not against that, some things just sound different. Also have the idea that the scooped some of the lows and highs in the mix so things sound a bit, i dunno, less punchy and a bit more open. Which again, isnt really a bad thing in general (it's actually something I prefer), but it does change the sound a bunch compared to the original.\n\nCould someone point me in the direction of tracks that are drastically different from the original release? Or is that not the point in these albums?\n\nI've just skimmed through and it all sounds the same and more like a remaster then anything.\n\nI think one of the bigger 'changes' is Style. The goal is still that everything 'sounds similar to the original' but there are clear changes in mix, instrumentation, etcetera, not to mention the fact that her vocals have changed a bit over the years. On a quick listen it's probably hard to find the differences but they are there. In some songs they actually work to the songs benefit, but I think it's Style that kinda 'suffered' the most.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Taylor Swift, but I obviously know the tracks from the radio.\n\nCould someone point me in the direction of tracks that are drastically different from the original release? Or is that not the point in these albums?\n\nI've just skimmed through and it all sounds the same and more like a remaster then anything.\n\nAs I understand these projects are more about credits and rights due to some historical legal battle.\n\nMy GF is a big ol' swifty so I'll probably pull both albums into my DAW later and A/B them\n\nIt's mostly subtle differences in intonation of her singing, some changes to how songs are mixed and how instruments are used. You won't probably notice any changes unless you are a big fan who has listened to the old albums countless times for years and years. So it makes sense for you not to notice.\n\nA huge reason she can even do this is because she has copyright over the songs themselves (the melody and lyrics), not the original recordings (the masters), and she has the money and fanbase to pull this off.\n\nThere's a reason why her versions of these songs are replacing the originals. Anyone who wants to use one of her songs is going to go to her first.\n\nAs for the album itself, it's growing on me. Blank Space is definitely different. It'll take me a while to determine if I like it over the original.\n\nJust a little remark. Although this is true she doesn't have to have the copyright over her song to be allowed to re-record them. Musicians can release covers of any songs they want to. So of course she would be allowed to cover her songs even if she had no rights over them.\n\n1. Welcome to New York - sounds sort of the same but has its own flare, especially with more voice modulation. KEEPING BOTH VERSIONS\n\n2. Blank Space - blown away by how nearly identical it sounds. KEEP\n\n3. Style - WTF happened!? Sounds so awful, I'm so mad! It's like Taylor singing along to a karaoke production version of her own song. HARD (AND SADDEST) SKIP\n\n4. Out Of The Woods - different but I like it. KEEPING BOTH VERSIONS\n\n5. All You Had To Do Was Stay - pretty faithful. No preference. KEEP\n\n6. Shake It Off - this and Blank Space are the most overplayed songs in media so it's refreshing to hear a slightly-different voiced Taylor playing over very faithful reproduction. I might prefer it to the OG. KEEP\n\n7. I Wish You Would - Very faithful but some weird background noises and vocals going on towards the end. KEEPING BOTH VERSIONS\n\n8. Bad Blood - pretty faithful. No preference. KEEP\n\n9. Wildest Dreams - pretty faithful. No preference. KEEP\n\n10. How You Get The Girl - I think I prefer the deeper voice on Taylor's Version! KEEP\n\n11. This Love - pretty faithful. No preference. KEEP\n\n12. I Know Places - pretty faithful. Loved the \"We run!\" delivery in Taylor's Version. KEEP\n\n13. Clean - OG version didn't resonate with me and neither does Taylor's Version sadly. SKIPPING BOTH VERSIONS\n\n14. Wonderland - also blown away by how nearly identical it sounds. KEEP\n\n15. You Are In Love - most blown away by how nearly identical Taylor's voice sounds here. KEEP\n\n16. New Romantics - biased because the OG is my favorite of all time but I don't mind Taylor's Version. They sound extremely different if you listen to the OG's isolated instrumentals. Taylor's Version sounds like the Rock N'Roll remix kinda. From what I can hear, Taylor's Version has way more prominent voice modulation, the strings on the chorus always sounded like they could've come out of a synthesizer keyboard in the OG but it sounds like actual guitar/bass here, and the background vocals need a lot more pizzazz. KEEPING BOTH VERSIONS\n\nNew Songs 17-21: Need more listens but they sound like singles that could've come from Lover or Midnights. Liked them enough to KEEP ALL\n\nWow. I was the most afraid of the 1989 re-recordings because I feared the most popular singles and bops would get butchered in re-production (see Red's We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together) but thankfully they didn't go too crazy with the changes for most of the album. From what I can tell, Welcome to New York and Out Of The Woods are really different enough. Style is just... no. And New Romantics is like a whole new remix which I ain't mad at.\n\nDamn, I think the new Style rips. The main synth line being way higher in the mix kind of reminds of Robyn's Dancing on my Own.\n\nsolid writeup from Variety; pretty much affirming my own thoughts that she and Antonoff are a bit too much of a team these days :P\n\nTaylor Swift’s ‘1989 (Taylor’s Version)’ Vault Tracks Bridge the Gap Between 2014 and the ‘Midnights’ Era: Album Review\n\nThe '1989 (Taylor's Version)' Vault section harks back to the Swift of 2014, lyrically, while, musically, sounding like a canny 'Midnights' sequel.\n\nThe \"1989\" Vault turns out not to have any songs that would have been obvious singles, like \"I Can See You,\" from the \"Speak Now\" re-do that came out just months ago. Or if there are any leftover Max Martin/Shellback cuts still somewhere in the can, she decided to keep them there for now, in favor of emphasizing what she's got going now with Antonoff. It's a good call, in my mind, to make the first Vault section that sounds kind of all of a piece, and a modern-day piece. She knows what never goes out of style, even if that means reverse-engineering some of her older writing here to feel like it takes place just before midnight."
