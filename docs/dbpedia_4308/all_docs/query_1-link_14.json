        "text": "The Malaysian government has designated 2007 as visit Malaysia year. The country is expected to attract more than 20 million visitors and earn about RM50 billion from tourism related activities. An important component in the tourism industry is the human resource. The human resource factor plays an eminent role in promoting the image of the country as a top tourism spot. Tourists do not just come for the facilities and attractions. They want to be treated right and well. A good command of the English language is always regarded as an asset for personnel in the tourism industry since most visitors do not speak Bahasa Melayu, the national language. However, the preference for those with good English proficiency will burden the recruitment of hotel personnel. This paper will present the findings of a study conducted employing the questionnaire survey and interview methods to investigate the relative role of English language proficiency in the choice of holiday destination. It was found...\n\nThe link between language and tourism has drawn attention from scholars such as MacCannell (1976) and Urry (1990), who argue that tourism establishment, through the language used, builds and determines tourist experience and destination imagery. Although they come from different objects, they both agree that this is the language that informs the tourist about what he / she needs to see before the trip, and that the language itself builds its appearance through \"a great expectation of pleasure\" (Urry, 1990). As Boyer and Viallon claim in their analysis of tourism communication (1994: 9-10), has become a tourist a place, not that it is so really, but it is the language that makes it so appealing. This argument was later developed by Graham Dann (1996), who was one of the first scholars to conduct a comprehensive sociolinguistic analysis of the use of language in tourist textbooks and to identify characteristics that characterize tourism as a \"language of social control \". He proposed a classification method for tourism media, based on a three-stage model of the tourism process (before, during and after the trip), which recognize the functions of the language used in promotional materials and their compelling power by phase that they belong.\n\nIn terms of ongoing globalization and rapid development of the tourism industry in Russia it is especially important to analyze the role of specific skills required for effective work in the sphere of tourism. One of them is advanced communication skills in foreign languages. The present article aims to analyze the role of foreign languages in training of Bachelor students in tourism and offer possible ways of solving current problems connected with language skills of future tourism industry employees. The importance of this topic is explained by a growing role of foreign languages, especially English, in the professional activity of future tourism industry employees and a lack of language skills required by their prospective employers. Current problems connected with language training of Bachelor students in tourism are analyzed. A multi-faceted role of English as one of the most popular languages in the world is described in application to the tourism industry. The research method...\n\nLanguage plays an imperative role in tourism organisational management. It facilitates communication among staff of head quarters and subsidiaries. It creates abilities to improve customers&#39; satisfaction, to enhance and maintain skills of tourism staff, to motivate international tourists, and to increase better understanding on demand and culture. Subsequently, personnel with language skills are becoming more and more necessary for tourism organisational management. However, roles of language in tourism organisational management are not understandable clearly to tourism staff and related personnel at managerial level. This paper is an exploratory analysis of the roles of language in tourism organisational management. Ideas for tourism organisational management and development and other related issues with respect to roles of language are pointed out. This paper also encourages practitioners to pay attention on the language issue. Collaboration among educational providers and tou...\n\nLanguages and tourism are two highly interrelated topics connected through many aspects. Specifically, foreign languages intertwine in everyday spoken communication among visitors and locals, in written creation or translations of texts in foreign languages, in marketing texts and many other areas that the language of tourism reaches. It is undoubtedly an intriguing topic to be studied, especially because of the specifics the language of tourism has to offer as the tourism lexis is characterized by ‘the interaction of the general lexicon andmultidisciplinary terminology within the field of tourism’ (Mikolič, 2015). The multidisciplinary nature of tourism enables researchers to study it from many different viewpoints and perspectives. That makes the scope of research of the connections among foreign languages and tourism vast, which was clearly visible at the third international conference titled Foreign Languages and Tourism this September held in Portorož, at The Faculty for Touris...\n\nThe aim of this paper is to gain more insight into the role of language in tourism promotional document by reviewing current research on tourism promotion. Search for related article were carried out via the online database using the keywords: tourism, tourism discourse and language of tourism. Very few studies focused on tourism websites or blog and on analysing both language and visual aspect of the tourism promotion. This paper concludes with a discussion of a proposed study which will employ a multimodal discourse analysis approach in analysing the tourism websites of top holyday destinations in South East Asia\n\nThe article deals with the problem of lingua-cultural peculiarities of tourism discourse, contrastive analysis of English and Georgian tourism-related vocabulary and terminology, and outlook of teaching tourism discourse to students or people who are interested in the field of tourism. Tourism discourse is an independent type of discourse that has a specific addressee and it refers to communication among people who do not belong to a specific social or cultural group or language community. Therefore, our main focus will be addressed to reveal language peculiarities of English and Georgian tourism discourse to make the teaching process easier for any group of people who are interested in understanding the specific terms and expressions used in the texts. Revealing lingua-cultural differences and similarities between the chosen English and Georgian texts contributes to a better understanding of various cultures and traditions. Thus, the paper aims to research the vocabulary and termin..."
