        "text": "It is possible that Britain would have done a deal with Hitler in 1940 absent Churchill.\n\nIt is also possible that Eden and Attlee would have kept Britian in the war.\n\nIf that happens I am inclined to think\n\n1) That Eden would be aware that he was not a military genious and would have made fewer purely military decisions that Churchill. I tend to think that this would be good for the allies and the West.\n\n2) Eden would not have had the same symbolic power as Churchill. I think that means that the Conservative Party suffers an even heavier defeat in 1945.\n\nI think you are right.\n\nWhether or not Churchill was around, the majority of the MPs in Westminster who wanted to oppose Hitler would look around for someone who would lead them. Churchill happened to be the best choice because he had been a Liberal and a Conservative. Most of the Labour MPs disliked him intensly but gave him their support because they wanted to continue the war and resist the Nazis.\n\nGiven this, Eden, although young at the time, had sufficent experience as Foreign Minister to get enough support to become the PM of a National Unity government. Attlee and Labour would certainly support him since they admired his anti-Fascist stand, although his opposition to Mussolini was mainly because of a personal rather than political dislike. The non-defeatists in the Conservatives would probably have supported him but I am not certain.\n\nYou are right I think in that Eden would have had a less hands on approach to the running of the war. This may be a mixed blessing though. Churchill's charisma at the beginning of the war was great propaganda and did lift morale. Particularly after Dunkirk and when he feted the RN crews after the sinking of the Graf Spee.\n\nOn the other hand, letting the generals command the strategic situation in North Africa would have meant the Italians would be driven out before the Africa Corps could land. No costly losses in Crete and Greece either. Greece may have been lost but Crete could have been held. The outcome of this for the war in the Med would be good news indeed for the Allies.\n\nProbably no Italian campaign either. Would there be as much support for the partizans in Yugoslavia? Would SOE be as involved in occupied Europe? Could morale be kept up as well?\n\nAs far as Tito and his partizans I think they would still be supported as much. SOE may have been even more effective if Eden go along better with De Gaulle. Eden may even have persuaded FDR that De Gaulle was a pain but still should be used as a partner rather than a rival. Morale is difficult to assume but I suppose in war time even a dead fish like Eden can be made to look dynamic and inspiring.\n\nChurchill's role in alerting the British to Hitler's menace and to the state of the UK military has been overstated. His death would have little to no impact on British politics in the thirties. He was a political non-entity for virtually all that period.\n\nRearmament went ahead anyway and most of the political elite soon came to the same conclusion about Hitler at about the same time as Churchill did. He was an admirer of both Italy and Germany under the dictators just like nearly all the conservative politicians.\n\nI call bullshit on this. How many other politicians were as vehemently opposed to the Munich agreements as Churchill was? Also, what was this so-called \"admiration\" for Mussolini and Hitler? If by \"admiration\" you mean that he initially thought that Fascism and Naziism were lesser evils than Communism, you might have a point, but I believe that any rational person should be able to see that belief that something is the lesser of two evils is very far from \"admiration\".\n\nI call bullshit on this.

He and they, admired Mussolini. Indeed they had been friends since Locarno. In 1927 he said of Il Duce'...if I had been an Italian I would have been with you from the start.' Again in 1933 he called him the, '...Roman genius and the greatest lawgiver amoung living men.' Then in 1936 he made a speech praising Mussolini an called for the end to sanctions and an alliance with Fascist Italy.\n\nTrue most of them soon became disenchanted with Hitler, but not before 1934/5. Read anything written by Churchill at this date and see what he really thought instead of repeating propaganda.\n\nOf course he was opposed to Munich. Nearly every Britsh politician was either opposed or were convinced they had no choice but to go through with the disagreeable negotiations until the UK and France had a chance to rearm. The difference was Churcill had completely unrealistic alternatives to appeasment.\n\nIn essence Churchill proposed what came about in 1939-42 but which was impossible before that time. He totally opposed the USSR being brought in as part of France's Collective Security pact. This is despite the fact that it was the only continental power capable of matching Germany. He wanted an alliance with the US despite its total isolationist position. Completely unworkable solutions and because everyone knew that he remained in the political wilderness.\n\nobviously not everyone is aware of the facts. the truth is that in 1940, with British forces defeated in France, both Halifax and RAB Butler, along with a fair proportion of the cabinet, wanted to sue for peace (Butler went as far as contacting Swedish diplomats to put out peace feelers to Hitler). The mood in the country at large, contrary to popular belief, was very negative (before the successes of the RAF), and it was touch and go as to whether Britain could fight on (financial reserves were almost exhausted).\n\nIt was only at a series of decisive cabinet meetings of 24th-28th May, that Churchill and his allies faced down the final move of the appeasers, and ensured that Britain would continue the fight. The view that Britain would have fought on and that \"Someone would've pulled them together\", is assuming that history has some inevitability. Britain's defeat was seen by most as inevitable in May 1940. What was most unlikely is what actually happened. It wouldn't even have taken an operation sea-lion to quell Britain - lack of support from America, or lack of backbone at home would have killed the war effort. Whatever one thinks of Churchill, and clearly he is a contentious, mercurial figure, he did sway the cabinet (and therefore the country) by his own will, and therefore kept us in the fight.\n\nHard to see Eden doing the same....\n\nHA!\n\nwell tell that to the RAF!\n\nYes , Churchill did tell that to the RAF and they rallied on to win a great victory...helped along by some classic errors on the part of Goering and Hitler.\n\nMy mother to this day has crystal clear memories of just how desperate every one felt. No one she knew, felt they could seriously win against the Germans, but would go down fighting. They learned quickly to cut in half any BBC claims of RAF kills and ended up with a much more realistic vision of how the battle was actually going. Not surprising either they had NO faith in the RN saving them either especially after Norway.Churchills speeches made a HUGE, HUGH difference to them.\n\nBTW , Well put Calgacus!\n\nIt seems the military history is written by the victors and then historians spend decades trying to correct the many many errors that appear in such histories.\n\nand for another thing, Eden was simply not an option for the PM's job in 1940. If Chamberlain was out, then only Halifax could have taken his place. Unless of course, Winnie's death created butterflies in the Tory hierarchy and made possible a different candidate.\n\nPerhaps Eden was not an option while Churchill was.\n\nWhy was Halifax the only option? Do you mean he had the numbers? Well he did in OTL too until the Labour Party, most of the Liberals and a considerable number of Tories got together and demanded that a National Unity government be put together to continue the war. If no Churchill then they would have to choose another candidate as PM. To ensure success they would need to choose a Tory and Eden would be an option.\n\nCertainly there would be no constitutional reason why Eden could not succeed."
