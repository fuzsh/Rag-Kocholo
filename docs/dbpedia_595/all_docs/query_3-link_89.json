The great majority of its readers, quoters, and critics see the first book, namely, the six chapters of text plus the bibliography, as an historical analysis of deception and surprise. And, of course, they are right. Others see the second book, the two appendixes that form a handy source book of more than 100 case studies. They too are right. And a few have perceived a third book—an original exercise in methodology—a method designed to unmask deception where it is present. This “third” book is a shadowy one, interwoven throughout the others and knitting them together. It is a model, a set of methods that underlie and pervade the entire work, sweeping back and forth and across the analytical chapters, case studies, bibliography, and the final database. More than either a historical analysis of military deception or a mere set of case studies, the deeper and more lasting value of this book is as a model or template of how to study and analyze deception operations. This model is constructed of the following seven separate and but mutually reinforcing methods:\n\n•\n\n•\n\nThe introductory chapters, by taking both a broad and deep look at surprise operations, provided promising questions and hypotheses about the possible causes of surprise, including deception. Each case looks on both sides of the hill, concentrating on the goals, planning, expectations, security, leaks, warnings, intelligence assessments, and final results. The analysis is conducted online—not by hindsight. Online, or “abductive,” inference is the reasoning process used by all consistently successful analysts of mysteries, from physicists and magicians to police detectives and intelligence analysts, regardless of whether they are analyzing past or current mysteries.\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 REPRINT\n\nAlthough all the case studies in Stratagem were past events, only six had come to my attention prelabeled Deception. Many weren’t even labeled Surprise. Consequently, they posed mysteries that could only be solved by the same kind of online analysis as if they had been current and ongoing. So, about halfway into the research, I evolved the following rule of thumb: Whenever some source reports surprise, look closely for deception—even faint hints of possible deception. If these are found, it justifies and should trigger a close search for verification among independent sources or channels. Other clues indicating that surprise and/or deception have been present are large discrepancies between casualties on both sides (“body counts” do count) or the results of combat that greatly exceeded or fell short of expectations.\n\n•\n\nEach case study ends with a conventional list of “References” but unconventionally divided by categories that, where available, had specific evidence. These categories are: Warnings, Surprise, Deception, and General, plus occasional special categories of Intelligence, Security, Enemy Expectations, and Camouflage. This model constantly and systematically reminds the analyst to seek and report these special types of data—types of data that even skilled analysts often overlook or underplay.\n\n•\n\nOne of the more interesting points of method that emerged early in my research was that I never had to fall back on my top-secret clearance. Yet all my research on Codeword BARBAROSSA and Stratagem was completed shortly before the British and U.S. governments began to open the classified files, particularly on all matters involving deception planning and operations in World War II. To detect deception, one must, at the minimum, know to look for those specific types of clues that point to deception. Some of those types of clues, or categories of data, are suggested earlier; they are an essential part of the counterdeception analyst’s toolkit.\n\n•\n\nThe tables that accompany most of the case studies are designed to summarize the data in such way as to emphasize the main factors that lead to surprise, success or failure (and to what degrees), high or low casualties, and so forth.\n\n•\n\nFinally and, I believe, most importantly, a cross-disciplinary attack is essential for detecting deception in either past or ongoing operations. By happy chance, I brought to these analyses substantial training in a rich mix of disciplines. The most relevant of these were the physical sciences, bacteriology, philosophy of science, sociology, political science, and Chinese area studies (Sinology), which itself encompassed the disciplines of, among others,\n\nForerunners and Influences\n\nxv\n\nhistory, linguistics, anthropology, and geology. So it was no accident that I was a ripe 41 years old when I completed Stratagem. It had taken me that long to acquire the cross-disciplinary knowledge to do so. No amount of urging or funding could have enabled me to do so before. But any suitably designed interdisciplinary team could do so quite effectively. This overall architecture of Stratagem is my reason for never attempting a revision or update. Having created a comprehensive methodological structure, I judged it complete and moved on to other compositions. In 1979 I drafted an updated and enlarged database titled DECEPTR that covered 232 battles in 20 wars from 1914 to 1973. I hope others will enlarge its database, expand its historical scope (both before 1914 and after 1968), and refine (or reject) its theory. To date, it seems that Stratagem has inspired only three substantial analyses but no true efforts to replicate, much 1 less expand or refine.\n\nForerunners and Influences Misdirection sets the scene for deception. If the misdirection fails, the deception will fail. When applied to military theory, I believe this key concept should be credited to the famous but highly controversial British military theorist, Captain B. H. Liddell Hart, although he never quite put it in these words. He first proposed the notion of an “indirect approach” strategy in 1929 in his The Decisive Wars of History: A Study in Strategy and enlarged on it in 1954 in Strategy: The Indirect Approach. Unfortunately, his critics seized on the ambiguous word “indirection” to grossly oversimplify his original insight and dismiss his consequent theory as mere circular reasoning. To do so, they had to twist his argument to be that only successful military operations are labeled as indirect. Even two of Liddell Hart’s most ardent supporters, Field-Marshal Archibald Wavell and Colonel T. E. Lawrence, privately accused him of imposing 1\n\nThese three studies are: (1) William R[obert] Harris, Counter-Deception Planning, Santa Monica, CA: The RAND Corporation, July 13, 1973, 169 unnumbered pages. Labeled as RAND Report R-1230-ARPA. A fine contribution to theory. Based on a detailed critique of Stratagem. (2) Ronald G. Sherwin, [with] Barton Whaley, “Understanding Strategic Deception: An Analysis of 93 Cases,” in Donald C. Daniel and Katherine L.

Dr. Sherwin was the sole author, with my contribution being limited to the database and some kibbutzing.

Mainly a secondary analysis of the raw coded data on tactical cases in DECEPTR.\n\nxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 REPRINT\n\nindirection on many of his case examples. Liddell Hart’s theory might have fared better had he stressed the words direction and indirection (that is, misdirection) and deception and surprise and spelled out the connections between each pair. His book (and its update in 1954 as Strategy) has been either wildly applauded or blindly attacked for its broad generalizations about strategy. To my surprise none of its many admirers or detractors have remarked on what I immediately recognized as its most important, indeed unique, merit, namely, its research method. This 1929 book of military history first applied any more or less systematically quantitative approach to one set of case studies, that is, a database—a rather large database. Liddell Hart laboriously collected and analyzed data (according to fairly uniform criteria) on 240 campaigns in 27 decisive wars (9 ancient, 18 modern) from antiquity to the end of the Great War, that is, nearly 25 centuries (405 B.C. to A.D. 1918). From this survey he concluded that: “In only six of these campaigns ... was a decisive result obtained by a direct strategic approach to the main army of the enemy!” Conversely, he found: twenty-six campaigns in which both the decisiveness and the indirectness of approach are manifest beyond dispute.... This high proportion of history’s decisive campaigns, enhanced as it is by the comparative rarity of the indirect approach, enforces the conclusion that the indirect approach is by far the most hopeful and economic form of strategy.” He also found that “the consistently successful commanders of history, when faced by an enemy in a position strong naturally or materially, have hardly ever attacked it directly.... Further, history shows that rather than resign himself to a direct approach, a Great Captain will take even the most hazardous indirect approach—if necessary over mountains, deserts or swamps, with only a fraction of force, even cutting himself loose from his communications.\n\nLiddell Hart had made a monumental breakthrough. That it has gone unnoticed can, I believe, be mainly attributed to the conventional education of the great majority of historians in general and military historians in particular. Being trained to seek out the small details, they tend to miss broad patterns. Most abhor “numbers, charts, and graphs,” as historian J. Bowyer Bell contemptuously called them (even while collaborating with me). The few historians who aimed for sweeping historical and cross-cultural generalizations were rightly demolished for stepping outside their periods and cultures of expert knowledge. But this particular litmus test doesn’t apply to the mathematically oriented military writers from F. W. Lanchester (1914, with his data-free hypothetical models), through Trevor Dupuy (1977), to Biddle (2004). We employ a level of statistical abstraction that is essentially operations research (OR) or, as in my case, out of the sociological tradition. We lean towards inductively building a database that we then search for patterns rather than deductively cherry-picking to support a preset theory.\n\nA Deception Project\n\nxvii\n\nMy starting point for developing a theory of deception was Liddell Hart, particularly his 1929 and 1956 editions, which I first read in 1967 or 1968. They were the necessary kick start for my Stratagem (1969). Then, in 1970, William “Bill” Harris returned from his first short stay at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica bearing three key papers by R. V. Jones (1957, 1965, and 1968) and thrust them upon me. Amazed by these timely treasures, they crucially helped refine my view of deception theory and opened my thoughts to the rich possibilities for counterdeception.\n\nA Deception Project This book, Stratagem: Deception and Surprise in War, originated as part two of my quadrilogy on deception. That project began in 1967 while I was at MIT’s Center for International Studies. I finished the initial two studies, both focused on military deception, in 1969. The first study was published four years later as Codeword BARBAROSSA. It had begun as an attempt to replicate Roberta Wohlstetter’s Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision (1962), the classic signal-versus-noise model of surprise attack. But, to my surprise, my study ended as a new surprise-through-deception model.\n\nWohlstetter’s Signals and Noise Model Roberta Wohlstetter had first spelled out the Wohlstetter Hypothesis in 1962 in her brilliant analysis of the Pearl Harbor strategic surprise. Her theory is a counsel of despair, telling us that surprise is inevitable because it is only by hindsight that we can distinguish the warning signals from the surrounding noise. This extraordinary and brilliantly presented theory has become the underpinning of all subsequent no-fault arguments to which all failed intelligence analysts from Pearl Harbor to 9/11 appeal. From then until today, the great majority of military intelligence analysts have assumed that she was right. I had agreed at first—indeed urged students to apply her research model to other cases of strategic surprise. Having failed to stimulate others to do this, I decided to do so myself, picking the seemingly similar case of Hitler’s 1941 surprise invasion of the Soviet Union. However, I diverged from Wohlstetter by 1969—first with Codeword BARBAROSSA’s alternative deception model and then when my reanalysis in Stratagem (Case A30) showed that even her Pearl Harbor case was less one of signals–noise befuddlement than that of a cunningly designed, competently executed, and successful Japanese deception operation. Both Wohlstetter and I were working blind in the early stages of searching for explanations of the Pearl Harbor and BARBAROSSA surprises. Hindsight told us only that the victims had been surprised, nothing about how that had happened. So our research method was not hindsightful but forward-looking in its puzzle\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 REPRINT\n\nsolving—the so-called Method of Zadig, that is, strictly in accord with standard abductive logic. Professor Ben-Zvi rightly says that Wohlstetter’s noise model pessimistically made no “claim” to “predicting or preventing surprise attacks,” but my deception model does make just such an optimistic claim. Wohlstetter had quickly attracted supporters among analysts of military surprise, particularly strategic surprise. Their mantras are: “Anyone can have 20–20 hindsight” and “It’s easy to be a Monday-morning quarterback.” The flaw in this argument had long ago been solved not only in practice (with the scientific method), but also, as mentioned earlier, in theory (abductive or retroductive inference). This had been my MIT doctoral dissertation, “Operation BARBAROSSA: A Case Study of Soviet Strategic Information Processing Before the German Invasion,” which I defended in 1969 in the Political Science Department. The MIT Press published it in 1973 with negligible changes. BARBAROSSA was as an exercise in methodology. It was my first effort to systematically incorporate a primitive version of the method that has recently come to be known in the intelligence community as Richards J. Heuer’s Analysis of Competing 2 Hypotheses (ACH). That it discovered, developed, and proposed an original model, specifically a deception model, to explain the strategic surprise of Hitler’s 1941 invasion of Russia was central. However, all but one of the book’s more than 60 initial reviewers ignored its method. They focused on its conclusions, either agreeing, doubting, or rejecting it. The exception was Alan Bullock, historian and chancellor of Oxford University, who recognized that I had attempted not just one more case study but instead used that case to create a rather fresh approach to a special type of problem in historical research—that is, not a method but methodology in the full sense of that widely misused term. His review, my favorite, in The New York Review of Books (June 28, 1973), concluded: Mr. Whaley’s conclusion is a controversial one which not everyone is going to accept. But that does not affect my admiration for the clear and systematic way in which he has gone about his study, with a running commentary explaining at each stage what he is doing, building up first one, then another hypothesis as he fits the [78] different bits of evidence into place. For this is a way of pursuing his-\n\n2\n\nI trace this primitive ACH-type research model back to A. J. A. Symons’s The Quest for Corvo: An Experiment in Biography (1934). Symons’s ingenuous approach was to interweave his own detective search to uncover the truth about the mysterious Baron Corvo with the reconstructed biography of the man. In both Codeword BARBAROSSA (1973) and The Man Who Was Erdnase (1991) I purposely followed Symons and Leonardo Olschki, Guillaume Boucher: A French Artist at the Court of the Khans (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1946). Professor Olschki, the good teacher, leads us step by step through his search for evidence, including sending us down all the blind alleys that he had pursued, discarding successive hypotheses until we (and he) confront and accept the most plausible one. This particular ACH analytical method has been codified by Richards J. Heuer, Jr. (1999) and refined by Stech and Elsaessar (2004).\n\nFuture Research\n\nxix\n\ntorical inquiry that allows mistakes to be corrected and alternative hypotheses considered without invalidating the method, a case study in historical detection which would have delighted the late R. G. Collingwood ... and which gave me great intellectual pleasure to read.\n\nMy second study (although the first published) is the one you see here. I had designed it to establish the relative frequencies of the signal-noise and deception models. It analyzed 168 cases of deception, surprise, and nonsurprise in 16 wars from 1914 to 1968. Appearing in 1969, it showed, again contrary to my expectations, that the then-standard signal-noise model was, in fact, both rare and weak (at least during the period studied), while the new deception model provided a more common and sturdier explanation of most strategic and operational-level surprises. The third study in the quadrilogy was The Prevalence of Guile. Although begun as the third study, it will be the last to be completed. It tracks the trajectory of deception through time, across cultures, and into military, political, and religious-philosophical disciplines. I began exploring the questions about the different roles of deception around late 1973, presented a summary in 1979 at the Fletcher School’s conference on “Intelligence, Deception and Surprise” in 1979, and in 1980 revisited parts of this topic in a short article.3 Unable to find funding for this project, I reluctantly set it aside for a quarter century until July 2006 when the orphan was adopted by the Foreign Denial & Deception Committee of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Thus, research resumed with updates, much new data, and substantial rethinking. How do we explain this roller-coaster history of Stratagem and its two flanking monographs that collectively sought to better understand how deception works? All three originated with and were developed over the past four decades without any outside funding until 2006. This was, I believe, a direct consequence of one of these studies’ own main findings, namely, that interest in funding deception research or practice by universities, think tanks, governments, and the military varies greatly through time. Thus military deception doctrine in the United States, having peaked during both world wars and almost vanishing afterwards, saw a fitful revival of interest in the 1970s, then passed into partial eclipse (with two pre-9/11 blips in 1999 and 2001), and is only now reviving once more in this first decade of the new millennium.\n\n3\n\nIn Harold Lasswell, Daniel Lerner, and Hans Speier in their monumental three-volume survey of Propaganda and Communication in World History (1980–1981).\n\nxx\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 2007 REPRINT\n\nThe fourth and final part of my quadrilogy was the short paper titled “Toward a 4 General Theory of Deception” (1982). This proposed the first theory of how deception operates and pervades all disciplines, throughout history, and across cultures. Having thus boxed the compass of how to deceive, it remained only to describe how to detect it. That began a new cycle of research, one still in progress.5\n\nFuture Research I hope that this renewed availability of Stratagem will stimulate similar systematic research on how deception works in military and political-military operations. The most useful research raises more questions than it answers. Today deception is widely accepted as a force multiplier, but how much so? To what degree or by what factor? Two times? Three times? And under which specific circumstances does deception give an unfair advantage to the deceiver? I suggest the following eight research priorities:\n\n•\n\n•\n\nUpdate the Stratagem database. This is crucial to develop new case studies of specific operations in the Soviet-Afghan War (1979–1989), the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), the Gulf War (1990–1991), Somalia (1993–1995), the Balkans (1992–1995), the U.S.-Afghan War, 1st Phase (2001–2003), and the Iraq War (2003). Enough unclassified information from both sides in these conflicts is now in the public domain for satisfactory unclassified analysis. (Are there any operations where access to classified intelligence would produce significantly different assessments?) Enrich the database. The criteria for Stratagem required that only those wars in the 1914–1968 period be included where all cases of strategic and operational battle were covered. Because of time constraints, Stratagem covered only 16 wars. It would be desirable to add at the minimum the following wars where adequate deception-relevant data is available: the Riff War (1919–1926), the Gran Chaco War (1932–1935), and particularly the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).\n\n4\n\nBarton Whaley, “Toward a General Theory of Deception,” Journal of Strategic Studies, Vol. 5, No. 1, March 1982, pp. 179–193.

Extend the time frame backwards to include cases from the earliest documented history to Stratagem’s close-off in 1914. A good starting point would be Captain Liddell Hart’s inventory of wars and campaigns, including particularly the deception, surprise, and data-rich campaigns of the Mongol world conquest, the Byzantine Wars, the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the American Civil War. Deepen the database. At present it covers only the strategic and operational levels of combat. It is important to extend the range of cases to cover all levels of tactical operations. Many tactical cases are described and analyzed in the opening chapters of Stratagem, but only anecdotally, not systematically. The best evidence is that, while all the basic theory and principles of deception apply throughout the strategic-tactical spectrum, there are notable differences in such matters as timing and the number and types of channels available for the communication and verification of deceptive messages. Refine at least some of the categories of analysis. For example, I have never been comfortable with the crude measure used for categorizing the degree of surprise. This is particularly important because the great majority of military historians and an unfortunately large proportion of intelligence analysts tend to treat surprise as an either–or event. Stratagem showed that this is probably never the case—surprise is never 100% or 0%. It seems that both combatants in every battle will experience at least some small element of the unexpected. More closely assess the role of deception in asymmetric wars. The question had been raised in Stratagem but treated only anecdotally in one chapter. There are many apt examples from antiquity to the present—Roman legions versus barbarian rabble, Chinese and European imperial conquests and the many subsequent “small wars,” Soviet guerrillas in World War II, and so forth. Identify and develop new categories of analysis. I suspect, for example, that entirely new categories can be identified and developed for measuring the degree of sophistication of deception methods. The one used in Stratagem is a crude (but surprisingly effective) total count of the number of gross types of channels used to “sell” each deception. With what is now known, this measure can be refined by both assigning “weights” to each channel and further refining the channels into a number of subchannels. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, refine and test the database to assess the effectiveness of various counterdeception techniques. Barton Whaley Pacific Grove and Ocean Beach, California January 2007\n\nPREFACE “I did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war.” –Shakespeare, Henry VI, Pt. I, Act IV, Sc. 5 This is a study of surprise and deception in warfare, with special reference to their operation at the strategic rather than the lower tactical level. For strategic deception I have revived the traditional word stratagem. Although it eventually became stretched to mean deceptive tricks or schemes in general,1 specifically any more-or-less elaborate plan to entrap or circumvent, stratagem remains an accepted military term and originally was only that. The word stratagem and its military meaning comes to English from the French stratag`eme.2 It reached French through the Italian stratagemma from Latin strategema. Naturally, the Greeks had a word for it: strategema, which betrays its military root in strategos, “a general” or, literally, “leader of an army.” It is, appropriately, a distant cognate of “strategy”–although this last word is modern both in its military sense and as a loan word in English.3 It is a French loan-word into Russian as stratagema. Its international acceptance is further evidenced by the Spanish and Portuguese estratagema. The reason stratagem as a military term has fallen into relative disuse is because its practice as one of the military arts underwent a long period of decline during the 19th century and has had only a slow and somewhat spasmodic revival in the 20th. But that renaissance is the subject of this study. . . A brief note is in order here at the outset about the way in which I have handled the empirical data. In addition to general readings in military theory and history, I have made specific studies of 168 battles from 16 wars during the period from 1914 through 1968. The studies–presented in outline in the appendices–comprise three categories. The main category–designated as the Type A Cases–comprises all, or virtually all, 68 instances of strategic surprise and/or strategic deception, as defined by the fairly rigid criteria spelled out in Chapter V. The second category–the Type B Examples–gives 47 selected examples of tactical surprise and/or deception. This category is included in the 1 The Oxford English Dictionary (O.E.D.) records its earliest appearance in this general sense in 1588. 2 The O.E.D. gives several citations beginning in 1489 with Caxton. 3 Specifically, in the late 18th century.\n\nxxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nPREFACE\n\nanalysis to judge if any meaningful differences emerge as surprise and deception shade from the strategic into the tactical. (To anticipate the findings: in general, no major differences were found.) The third category–the Type C Examples–gives 53 selected examples of battles where there is specific evidence that neither surprise nor deception were involved. This category is included to provide the maximum or sharpest contrast with the two categories that do contain the strategic and tactical instances. (It was found that the differences were unexpectedly many and surprisingly profound.) At this point I must stress the fact that I have avoided using the terminology, much less the techniques, of mathematical statistics. A word of explanation is perhaps in order for the information of readers who are not familiar with statistical theory but are accustomed to find statistical manipulation in political, sociological, and military studies based on sets of cases, some of which number less than the 163 comprising this study. Statisticians will already have realized from even my brief description of my three types of cases and examples that none meet the basic criteria of statistical samples.4 Types B and C are selected examples, hence they do not meet the fundamental requirement of “randomness.” Failing this, they do not constitute “samples,” in their technical statistical sense. Type A, on the other hand, exceeds or transcends the requirements of a statistical “sample.” It is neither selected nor random but claims all-inclusiveness. Consequently, it is not statistically legitimate to generalize to any wider “universe” or “population” of cases or examples, because the Type A cases already exhaust the members of their class while Types B and C are composed of selected examples of uncertain typicality. It is, of course, quite proper to treat such sets of data quantitatively, summarizing them as frequencies (totals, sub-totals), percentages, fractions, ratios, etc. This is the limit of quantification applied in this paper. However, even here, the reader should be most cautious how he applies or extrapolates these quantitative findings to any cases not reported, particularly those outside the 1914-1968 period studied, as no statistically valid judgments about such cases are warranted. The “best educated guess” can be our only blind-man’s guide into such unknown terrain. Finally, some comments about sources. Because the topic of this research goes to one of the innermost rings of secret intelligence operations, I am often asked how such research is possible on an unclassified basis. In fact, the problem has not been to ferret out the rare indiscretion but, rather, to select the more detailed, perceptive, and authentic references from a quite voluminous literature of most varied quality. The extensive bibliographical appendix and many footnote references testify to the dimensions of this–the real-problem. First, hundreds of examples and all the generalizations are already present in Greek, Roman, Biblical, Chinese, and Vedic antiquity and in the European Renaissance. Second, 4 Particularly relevant discussions of the frequent abuses of statistics are given by the medical statistician, Lancelot T. Hogben, Statistical Theory (London: Allen and Unwin, 1960); and the sociologist, Hanan C. Selvin, “A Critique of Tests of Significance in Survey Research,” American Sociological Review, Vol. 22, No. 5 (October 1957), p. 519-527.\n\nxxv memoirs provide a rich source of directly pertinent data, although most of this is of as fragmentary a nature as their authors’ brief glimpse into the workings of a deception operation. Third, some astonishing indiscretions have occurred, particularly on the part of American writers who published their memoirs in the period after regular wartime censorship ended in 1945 and before the onset of the Cold War in 1948 retightened the security system. This was, for example, true of Eisenhower’s aide, Captain (U.S.N.) Butcher who in 1946 disclosed the SOLO ruses for the North African invasion and much of the FORTITUDE plan–including the Monty’s double hoax–for Normandy, as well as mentioning such unmentionables as “one-time pads.”5 Similarly Robert J. Donovan (also 1946) published a (carefully garbled) version of “the man who never was.” 1946 was a vintage year for disclosures for even J. Edgar Hoover then provided the only detailed account of FORTITUDE NORTH, omitting only the code-name. In 1947, Major General Deane, Chief of the wartime U.S. Military Mission in Moscow, gave us not only the code-name (futilely censored by all subsequent U.S. and British official historians) but what remains our only detailed account of the still classified Operation BODYGUARD, the brilliant and successful deception of grand strategy to shield the Second Front. The British were more cautious. In 1946 their official historians were directed to avoid nearly all aspects of intelligence.6 Moreover, they have enforced this control even to the extent of virtually monopolizing the early published output of German, World War II intelligence memoirs.7 Despite these restrictions a number of disclosures leaked through, such as those in the 1947 memoirs of Montgomery’s intelligence officer and later Chief of Staff, Major-General Sir Francis DeGuingand. Also, in 1950, the wartime Minister of Information, Duff Cooper, managed to surface enough new details of the “man who never was” ruse in the thin guise of a novel to trigger some subsequent official disclosures. This is the current pattern. Enough unauthorized disclosures have appeared to bring enough relaxation of official restrictions that it is generally true to say that the broad outlines and many of the details of most deception operations through World War II are now in the public domain. Even the Russians have recently begun to acknowledge their part.\n\n5 Some overpaid editor (or censor) managed to delete the code-name FORTITUDE from the page proofs but missed it (and its definition) in the index. 6 Donald McLachlan, Room 39: A Study of Naval Intelligence (New York: Atheneum, 1968), p. xv. 7 An instructive exercise is to do a comparative study of the editors and publishers and, particularly, the translators of these works.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS I recognize and gratefully acknowledge three paramount personal intellectual debts in the formulation and development of my notion of stratagem. In both chronological and conceptual order they are: First, Professor A. George Gitter for his empirical research on and discussion of hypocrisy that initially sensitized me to this highly relevant style of behavior. Second, to Mr. William R. Harris for generously sharing, his studies and bibliography of intelligence and national security. His broad historical knowledge of intelligence increased the salience of the issue of deception operations in my mind to the point where I have now generalized from my original case study of one such operation. Third–although I know him only through his writings–to Captain Sir B. H. Liddell Hart, whose concept of “alternative goals” came to my attention just when I needed such a unifying operational theory. I wish to thank the following, persons for suggesting references to specific case studies: Professor Earnst Halperin of the Department of Political Science at MIT, professor Uri Ra’anan of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and Dr. Robin Alison Remington the Center for international at MIT. In particular I thank Professor Ithiel de Sole Pool for his encouragement and Mr. James L. Dorsey of the M.I.T. Center for International Studies for coordinating the typing of the finished manuscript.

B.C. Having decided to initiate war, open a new theater of operations, launch an offensive, or merely renew an ongoing battle, the national leader or military commander faces a dilemma. And if his foe has comparable or greater strength his choice will have decisive consequences. His dilemma is how to mobilize and deploy his martial means while retaining enough secrecy or at least uncertainty to avoid sacrificing surprise, much less drawing a preemptive attack. The pedestrian textbookish answer to the planning of surprise attack is “security.” Although security is a logical–indeed tautological–cause of secrecy, it is unrealistic to expect it to conceal any large-scale operation. With rare exceptions, even the tightest security measures guard against disclosure only to the most naive, preoccupied, witless, incompetent, or unlucky enemy. Of the 61 cases of strategic military surprise that occurred between 1914 and 1968, no more than 4 can be exclusively or even mainly attributed to the initiator’s passive security.1 This seemingly holds even at the tactical level where, although as would be expected, security usually has an easier task, still at most only 7 out of 54 of the selected examples of tactical surprise can be attributed to effective security. More or less specific warning signals almost inevitably filter through the security screen and reach the intended victim. Moreover, these warnings usually increase in frequency and specificity as the attacker’s preparations unfold, drawing more and more indiscrete persons into the planning and making ever more visible the many necessary adjustments in mobilization, deployment, logistics, and perhaps diplomacy. The commander need not sit impotent, hoping that the rare lucky chance or the uncertainty engendered by the ever-present “fog of war” will smite his 1 See Appendix B, Lists A and B, for columns Surprise (code Y), Deception (code N), Warning (code N).\n\n1\n\n2\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRATAGEM IN WARFARE\n\nfoe with an even more profound blindness. There is one type of activity still available that will multiply his chances of gaining surprise. That is stratagem.\n\n1.1\n\nDeception in History The stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the corner stone. –Acts, 4:11\n\nAlthough deception runs through the history of war, historical surveys are very rare.2 Moreover there are no analytical studies of the topic. The reason for this gap seems to be that deception has been so infrequently or, rather, intermittently and idiosyncratically practiced that it has never gained a firm hold on formal doctrine. As Colonel T. E. Lawrence observed, “deceptions . . . for the ordinary general were just witty hors d’oeuvres before battle.”3 Even its resurgence in World War II and the subsequent urgent stress on strategic surprise in nuclear war have produced only two or three case studies and no analytical efforts, at least not in the public domain. Deception is one of those odd strategic techniques of war, like psychological warfare, that seems fated to cycles of loss and reinvention despite being both older than history and international. Pre-historic legend gives us such familiar examples as the Trojan Horse and Gideon. History adds many examples such as Hannibal in the 3rd century B.C. And Chinggis Khan was a 13th century master of the surprise attack in all its strategic, tactical, and technological aspects. The ever victorious Mar´echal de Saxe restored deception, surprise, and maneuver to European battlefields in the early 18th century. Wolfe used deception against Montcalm in the mid-18th century. Frederick the Great, during the late 18th century, employed various stratagems in battle, but to neither the extent nor with the unalloyed triumph that marked Saxe. Napoleon used it, particularly in his early (successful) battles before he shifted his reliance to the crushing weight of massed artillery and disciplined numbers. “Stonewall” Jackson (and Lee) revived it, and Sherman perfected it in the mid-19th. Although the elevation of deception to a strategic principle has almost always been an idiosyncratic fad of exceptionally imaginative leaders rather than a routine textbook practice, all military and intelligence services have made sufficiently frequent tactical use of it–or of particular aspects of it–that it has at least developed its own technical vocabulary. Thus, at the most general level of strategy, it is called stratagem or deception by the British, deception by the CIA, diversion or demonstration by the American military and in NATO, stratag`eme 2 Those known to me are Frontinus’ first century A.D. Latin primer, the Strategernata; Carlet de la Rosi` ere, Stratag` emes de Guerre (1756), reputedly a mere set of cases; Colonel G. B.

In English we also meet the terms feint and ruse. Similarly, the deliberate feeding of false or misleading information to enemy intelligence services is variously called deception by the British, intoxication by the French, Irref¨ uhrung or colloquially Bl¨ uten (“blossoms”) by the Germans, and dezinformatsiya by Soviet intelligence. Finally, at the mere level of concealment or disguise it is called cover by the British and American intelligence services, camouflage by their armies, and Tarnung by the Germans.4 Churchill put it to an appreciative Stalin that strategic deception was the “bodyguard” of surprise. This is perhaps as generally valid a fact of strategic surprise as can be made. The assertion has its empirical verification in Chapter VI, where in 41 out of 53 cases deception directly aided the achievement of strategic surprise. Despite the great importance of this topic, it is almost entirely overlooked by historians and students of international relations. This oversight is a direct consequence of the fact that governments continue to withhold that particular part of their World War I and II archives long after the public release of most other case materials. As one former senior CIA official has confirmed: “. . . strategic deception, whether in peace or in war, is the most secret of secret operations.”5\n\n1.2\n\nThe Practitioners How can you fancie one that lookes so fierce, Onelie disposed to martiall Stratagems? –Marlowe, Tamburlaine, Act III, Sc. 2.\n\nDeception has been a military art–not a craft, much less a science. Consequently it has its practitioners with their biographers, autobiographers, and case studies–but not its field manuals, much less its theoreticians, at least not until after World War II. Rather, deception has been transmitted from practitioner to practitioner by either direct personal instruction or historical example. In early times, the practitioners–the “notable Captaines stratagematique”– were the commanders themselves: Hannibal, Caesar, Chinggis Khan, Saxe, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, Wellington, and others. We do not have to seek behind the commanders for clever illusionists whispering strategies and suggesting stratagems, because these commanders performed virtually unsupported by the advice of specialized staffs.6 By the 19th century, the growth and international diffusion of the general staff system had begun to shift military planning and decision making from 4 See particularly Colvin (53), 108, 121; Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Dictionary (JD), (Washington, D.C.: 1962), under “demonstration” and “diversion.” 5 Christopher Felix (pseud.), A Short Course in the Secret War (New York: Dutton, 1963), pp. 152-154. 6 Chinggis Khan and some other early commanders did have primitive general staff systems. And these and still others commonly had courtly advisers who sometimes contributed military advice. Consequently, the difference between their period and the 19th-20th centuries was more quantitative than strictly qualitative.\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRATAGEM IN WARFARE\n\nindividuals to committees. Even then it seems that the outstanding innovators– Generals Bonaparte, Jackson, and Sherman–pretty much kept their own counsel in matters of grand tactics and broad strategy, which they deemed to include stratagem. It is only when we enter the 20th century that we find stratagem relegated to a staff function. General Roberts achieved surprise and gained his victory at Kimberly through the use of deception, but this last was the contribution of his staff intelligence officer, Colonel Henderson, who merely applied his academic studies of “Stonewall” Jackson. Indeed, the field intelligence services became henceforward the main repositories of this moribund art. Moreover, the military intelligence services were generally puny, neglected affairs. Consequently it is not really surprising that stratagem held such fragile claim on war. The commanders appointed to send the big battalions to glory–Joffre, Nivelle, Foch, the younger Moltke, Falkenhayn, Robertson, Haig–neither used nor understood surprise, much less deception. The practice of deception in the Great War is found only intermittently and, then, mainly on peripheral fronts–at Gallipoli in 1915, in East Africa in 1916, and Palestine in 1917-1918. It was never part of what then passed for grand strategy. There are only seven–perhaps thirteen–exceptions to my generalization that stratagem has become a mere staff function in 20th century strategic planning. These altogether exceptional persons are Churchill, Hitler, Wavell, Rommel, Alexander, MacArthur, and Dayan. (The other possibles–uncertain only because conclusive evidence is lacking–are Marshall, Atat¨ urk, Mao, Yadin, and Giap.) It is probably fruitless to muse over the presumably special quality of mind shared by these men. All are highly unorthodox, creative, imaginative men. All–except Rommel and Zhukov–have a strong sense of history. But these same qualities were also shared by Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy, and in part by Chiang Kai-shek, De Gaulle, and Gamal Abdul Nasser, none of whom ever demonstrated any deep understanding of stratagem as applied to war. Comparison of these two groups hardly supports the most obvious hypothesis: that day-to-day experience with political or bureaucratic deviousness is a natural training-ground for its military-strategic counterpart. In other words, there is no direct connection between proficiency in political stratagem and proficiency in military stratagem. This is doubly remarkable, if we consider Clausewitz right in his argument that war is an extension of politics. Moreover, political stratagem and military stratagem are, at least on the spotty evidence, sharply distinguished by the manner in which they are acquired as skills. On the one hand, political deception seems to be picked up as one element in a general socializing process, being usually acquired unconsciously or at least un-selfconsciously as a result of the trial-and-error rewardand-punishment learning process that comes with social pressure, peer-group emulation, etc. In other words, socio-political hypocrisy is learned, but it is not formally taught. Like mores, hypocrisy is, as Professor Gitter has empirically demonstrated, simply “a way of life.” Stratagem, however, seems to be learned as a result of verbal or written instruction. Thus Wavell cites Meinertzhagen, Clarke could cite Wavell, and Montagu could quote Clarke. Stratagem is a skill\n\n1.2. THE PRACTITIONERS\n\n5\n\ntransmitted by conscious instruction from master to student. I do not understand why these two superficially similar modes of deception are evidently so different. The question should prove an answerable one through the method of comparative biography-interviews with the practitioners themselves being the most direct way to collect data. At any event, it is surely a worthwhile problem for students of psycho-politics and political-military decision-making. Where Hitler took only a pragmatically shrewd view of the utility of deception, Churchill was delighted–even somewhat fascinated–by it as an intellectual game in itself. He enjoyed inventing or encouraging such toys for his soldiers. Thus, his “tanks,” “Mulberries,” “Commandos,” and the electronic “Wizard War” that he would unleash against Kaiser and Hitler alike. It is striking that many of these and other devices and techniques were conceived for their surprise effect in support of strategy or even stratagem. The “Wizard War” was Churchill’s name for the game of electronically deceiving the Luftwaffe. The “tanks” were to revolutionize war by their surprise appearance. The covert Special Operations Executive was directed by him to do nothing less than metaphorically “set Europe ablaze.” “Mulberries” were the artificial harbors towed to the Normandy beachhead thereby permitting major landings at points German intelligence had judged “impossible.” Churchill’s first such notion was, I think, that of an entire dummy fleet. Conceived by him in 1911, he directed its construction in 1914 as a master ruse to lure the German High Seas Fleet into battle.7 Churchill’s second known ruse of his own devising was the Royal Marine’s demonstration landing at Ostend on 26 August 1914 (Example B2). His early flair for stratagems continued through both world wars, reinforced by his keen encouragement of this talent in others. Was the controversial “Monty” a master of surprise and deception? This is implied by their successful application under his command in North Africa– particularly at Alam Halfa, Alamein, and M´edinine–and his participation in operations supported by stratagems in Dieppe, Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, and France.8 And as “Monty’s double” he was himself the ruse. Moreover, his auto-hagiographic memoirs do little to suggest that any of his many successes stemmed from other minds. But, did Earl Montgomery of Alamein make any personal contribution to the deception planning in the campaigns for which he had command responsibility? This does not seem to be. Neither his own memoirs nor the official campaign histories show that he took any interest in such matters even when they were present. Moreover, a growing body of critical scholarship and personal memoirs contradicts his claims to imaginative strategic conceptions, comprehensive planning, and daring execution.9 These accounts now attribute his outstanding leadership to other qualities. Much the same point–and here I refer only to their roles in deception planning–applies to both General Eisenhower 7 See\n\nCase A2. Cases B27, A35, B29 and B26, B30, A38, B31, A45, A47. 9 I think particularly of Correlli Barnett, R. W. Thompson, and Liddell Hart. And even the personal memoirs of two of his closest associates and most avid supporters, de Guingand (his chief of staff) and Alexander (his chief) do not link Montgomery directly to the deception plans conducted under his command. 8 See\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRATAGEM IN WARFARE\n\nand General Patton. Regarding only deception, Wavell’s mantle of stratagem was passed to Alexander rather than to Montgomery. It is tempting to link some general personality “type” with the ability to understand and use surprise and deception and to associate its reverse type with the failure to do so. Yet, if such a correlation between personality and use of these particular military concepts exists, it is not a simple one–at least, I am unable to see it on the basis of preliminary comparisons either among the more prominent practitioners or between the practitioners and non-practitioners. From the 1920s on Montgomery proved himself incapable of even understanding the concepts of surprise, the “expanding torrent” (i.e., the Blitzkrieg exploitation of a break-through), or the importance of information about his enemy. Montgomery had gained a cocksure mastery of the most advanced strategic concepts evolved on the Western Front by 1918, but he was unable to give more than lip-service to the subsequent concepts of Fuller and Liddell Hart, despite ample exposure to them.10 Yet the commander whom Montgomery seems most closely to resemble in personality traits–MacArthur–was a master practitioner of surprise, and deception. Thus we are left with an unanswered question. While the spotty evidence available does point to stratagem being pretty much an art passed on from teacher to student, there is at least the low probability that it can sometimes be an entirely self-taught technique. Despite the great rarity of independent invention, it does occur; and military deception is no exception. Stratagem was evidently quite independently developed at both ends of the ancient world: China and the Mediterranean. Moreover, it seems quite plausible that an imaginative commander invent it by merely applying in his profession hypocrisy and deceits of his everyday social or political life.11 (The 18th century British General Wolfe may be a case in point.) While stratagem can aid the strong as well as the weak, the defensive as well as the offensive, the exigencies of desperate survival do stimulate wise leaders to seek such unorthodox solutions, as witness Churchill’s ready acceptance of deception planning in 1941 and the Israelis in 1948.\n\n10 R.

W. Mills, and Marcuse), economic humor (C. Northcote Parkinson), and sophisticated “common sense” (Eric Berne). However, all of these depend entirely on anecdotal evidence. Only one single empirical study exists devoted explicitly to this problem–the unpublished doctoral dissertation, Hypocrisy as a Way of Life (1963), by the Polish-American sociologist, Professor A. George Gitter of Boston University.\n\n1.3. THE RUSES OF WAR\n\n1.3\n\n7\n\nThe Ruses of War “Whiche subtilites and wylis are called stratagemes of armes.” –Caxton, The Book of Fayttes of Armes and Chyvalrye (1489), Chap. II, Part i.\n\nThe variety of ruses comprising stratagem is very great indeed. The array is limited only by the inventiveness of devious minds. As catalogues of these are readily available in the Strategemata of Frontinus and in the appendices of this present study, I will not attempt to list them here. However, a brief listing of the more important types is in order.\n\n1.3.1\n\nDiversions: Feints and Demonstrations\n\nThe terms diversion, feint, and demonstration are frequently met in military jargon where, however, they tend to be used more-or-less interchangeably.12 Throughout this text I have somewhat arbitrarily distinguished among them as follows. Diversion may be defined as any movement of military units intended to imply a main attack. Its purpose is to divert the opponent’s attention and strength away from the real or main operation. Diversion has two modes: feints and demonstrations. The feint is an entirely mock attack or simulation of a build-up for an imminent attack. It is analogous to the feint in boxing or fencing. Its specific purpose is to divert the enemy without tying down one’s own local forces in battle or incurring the losses of battle. The demonstration, on the other hand, involves actual commitment to battle. Its specific purpose is– or, rather, should be–to fix the enemy, locking his local forces in combat and drawing his reserves into an irrelevant fray.13 Thus, while the demonstration seemingly gives more assurance of a prolonged and large commitment of enemy strength, it risks heavy loss of men and materiel. Despite its special quality, the demonstration attack is essentially a sacrifice operation and should, therefore, be employed sparingly and then only in extreme or special circumstances. Nevertheless, there is a marked tendency for commanders to overlook these distinctions, with consequent waste of their limited military resources. This oversight is, I suggest, probably due to the failure of doctrine to recognize the degree to which a sophisticated deception plan can usually assure that a cheap feint will prove more effective than a costly demonstration.14 12 See\n\nSubsection 5.4, page 101. military usage “demonstration” has a secondary meaning of a display of one’s capabilities for purposes of deterrence or coercion. 14 An important exception to this generalization arises in those (historically) rare cases where demonstrations are themselves both directed against worthwhile targets and shielded by their own subsidiary deception plan. 13 In\n\n8\n\n1.3.2\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRATAGEM IN WARFARE\n\nCamouflage “Let every soldier hew him down a bough, And bear’t before him; thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us.” –Macbeth, Act V, Sc. iv.\n\nCamouflage is intimately related to stratagem.15 While some camouflage doctrines acknowledge a relationship,16 none of which I am aware have developed to a point where camouflage and stratagem can be said to be connected by theory.17 Although camouflage was known to and used by field commanders since antiquity, it took the prying eye of aerial reconnaissance to provoke a response in the form of a comprehensive program of concealment conducted by specialized camouflage units. That innovation took place at the Western Front in 1915, almost simultaneously in the French, British and German armies, and the technique soon spread to the other combattant powers.18 Thus formal camouflage doctrines began, as its very name (French camoufler, “to disguise”) indicates, merely as a security technique. However, by 1917,19 the gradual growth of stratagem had made a second mode of camouflage general. Camouflage doctrine then explicitly acquired its two key functions: “negative” or dissimulative camouflage whereby military objects were concealed and “positive” or simulative camouflage in which dummy military objects were displayed to mislead the enemy. It is this “positive” or simulative aspect that elevates from security to stratagem. This most significant concept then gained a hold on camouflage doctrine and received important reinforcement in World War II as a consequence of its general use by German, British, and Russian deception planners.20 However this hold is still a tenuous one, as shown by the fact that this particular bimodal concept has recently been dropped from U.S. Army camouflage doctrine.21\n\n1.3.3\n\nDisinformation\n\nThe most important single broad category of ruses includes all false information fed into another’s information system in order to deceive him. The standard 15 General readings include Lt.-Col. C. H. R. Chesney, The Art of Camouflage (London: Hale, 1941). 16 For example, current British, U.S., and Soviet camouflage doctrine. 17 Camouflage in modern national military doctrine is described country-by-country in Chapter II, below. 18 For camouflage in WW I see Major E. Alexander Powell, The Army Behind the Army (New York: Scribner’s, 1919), pp. 82-97. 19 The earliest case known to me from WW I of the use of simulative camouflage in conjunction with a deception operation is Case A2 (Gallipoli, 25 April 1915). 20 For camouflage in WW II see Jasper Maskelyne, Magic–Top Secret (London: Paul, 1949); and Geoffrey Barkas and John Hutton, “Camouflage of Middle East Airfields,” Royal Air Force Quarterly, Apr 1953, as digested in Military Review, Vol. 33, No. 10 (January 1954), pp. 99-107. 21 FM 5-20, (January 1959), pp. 4, 5, 28-29.\n\n1.3. THE RUSES OF WAR\n\n9\n\ntechnical term is “disinformation”. It is conventionally meant to cover only the verbal or written forms of information, leaving “camouflage” and “diversion” to cover the nonverbal or visual forms. Disinformation was originally a World War I term, having been first applied to the Disinformation Service of the German General Staff. The Russian Bolshevik Cheka adopted the term (as dezinformatsiya) and the technique in the early 1920’s, and it has been in use by the Soviet state security (OGPU, NKVD, KGB, etc.) and military intelligence services (GRU) ever since.22 Current Soviet Russian intelligence parlance uses this term in a sense so broad that U.S. Government translators sometimes translate it as “deception,” although Russians are careful to distinguish it from physical camouflage (maskirovka).23 The term, as borrowed from the Russian, is now also common in U.S. intelligence parlance, but is used in a less comprehensive sense. Any communication channel that transmits relevant and true information (“signals”) can also transmit both irrelevant information (“noise”) and relevant but false information (both deliberate “disinformation” and inadvertent “misinformation”). I find this tri-modal categorization of human information more useful for both didactic and analytical purposes than the now common bimodal “signal-noise” model borrowed by Roberta Wohlstetter from Shannon’s electronic Information Theory. Mrs. Wohlstetter’s analogy loses both misinformation and disinformation in her limbo category of “noise,” thereby making it impossible for her model to cope with deception operations as a distinct problem for intelligence analysis.24 Disinformation is generated for several purposes. It can be used in indiscriminate volume to overload an opponent’s communications and analysis system during critical periods, thereby causing delays and confusion. While I do not know of any actual examples, such a tactic is quite feasible, as most information processing systems operate with little margin for coping with sudden increase in volume. (This is illustrated by the delays the U.S. Army and Navy cryptanalytic sections experienced in dealing with their Japanese intercepts immediately before the Pearl Harbor attack in 194125 or by the temporary breakdown in NATO communications during the Czech invasion of 1968.)26 Disinformation is very widely practiced for political propaganda and subversion.27 Disinformation is routinely used by all counterespionage services to discredit the more valuable information sources of opposing intelligence services. (The 22 W. G. Krivitsky, In Stalin’s Secret Service (New York: Harper, 1939), pp. 234-240, gives some authoritative remarks on the history of the term. 23 For example, in Shimansky (68). See also TM 30-544: Russian Military Dictionary (Washington, D.C.: War Department, 1945). 24 Roberta Wohlstetter, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1962), pp. 1-3, 55-56, etc. For my detailed critique see Whaley, Operation BARBAROSSA (69). I have made some additional comments in my own reassessment of the Pearl Harbor attack (Case A30). 25 David Kahn, The Codebreakers (New York: Macmillan, 1967), pp. 14, 16. 26 Andrew Wilson, “Why the Czech invasion caught NATO napping,” The Observer, 17 November 1968, p. 4. 27 The most comprehensive single study is Paul W. Blackstock, Agents of Deceit: Frauds, Forgeries and Political Intrigue among Nations (Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1966).\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRATAGEM IN WARFARE\n\nBritish have been particularly adept at inducing self-destruction among their enemies’ intelligence services ever since Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen played his lethal games with German agents in the Great War.)28 Finally, but most relevant for the present study, disinformation forms a key element in stratagem. In theory, any communication media or channel can carry disinformation. All that is required is that the deceiver have access to the channel and that the intended victim be a user of that channel. While this is a truism, its elements are, in practice, too often forgotten or taken for granted.29 The key question is: “Is anybody listening?” It must be asked, it deserves major efforts to verify that the chosen channel is open, and it requires an answer. Where there is any reasonable doubt about the free flow of disinformation in the channel, the only solution is channel redundancy–to use other channels to repeat the message. Again, if this is mere truism, it too is one commonly forgotten as, for example, even by Allen Dulles when he failed to query the intrinsic implausibility of his false presumption that the clearly risky (but successful) “Man Who Never Was” Operation MINCEMEAT was the “single move” in the deception operation mounted by the British to mask the Allied intention to invade Sicily.30 There are, I suggest, three reasons for the non-systematic application of such “obvious” principles of stratagem. First, there is no broadly accepted body of theory of intelligence or information processing to set universal standards or procedures–intelligence remains an art subject to the idiosyncratic doctrines or whims of individual chiefs of intelligence. Second, the quality of intelligence suffers from its dependence on human organizations which inevitably treat other activities as more salient to their parochial goals. Third, while any type of communication channel can be used to transmit disinformation, a rather small number are in common use. At this point I will simply list them together with brief comments. They are presented approximately in descending order of frequency.31 Word-of-mouth Although rumors generally enjoy a very low credibility rating,32 word-of-mouth channels have been used in more deception operations than any other single type of channel. Surprisingly, it is far too often just these few deliberately planted rumors that filter through to the enemy’s skeptical intelligence officers and are credited by them. (Conversely, 28 See\n\nCase A6. several of the case studies (such as Example B40) show. This syndrome reached the farcical level during the Korean War when the dozen or so transmitters of VUNC (Voice of the United Nations Command) had only one reported listener, a woman in Shanghai who tuned in to hear the jazz on the preceding U.S. Armed Forces Radio disk-jockey show. (In 1959 I did discover several additional members of the 1950-1953 target audience.) In addition, it was known–from the Chinese themselves–that 2,000 Communist cadre were officially assigned to monitor VUNC and other foreign psychological warfare broadcasts. However this sophisticated “captive” audience was not treated as a psywar “target.” 30 Allen Dulles, The Craft of Intelligence (New York: Harper & Row, 1963), p. 146. 31 For rough frequency counts (covering the size range from grand strategy down through grand tactics) see Table 5.16 on page 100 below. 32 The most comprehensive general study is still Gordon W. Allport and Leo Postman, The Psychology of Rumor (New York: Holt, 1947). 29 As\n\n1.3. THE RUSES OF WAR\n\n11\n\nalmost every authentic warning coming through word-of-mouth channels is discredited, if it is competing with a deception campaign.)33 Newspapers The prestige press of all nations is a major medium for transmission of disinformation. In totalitarian societies this is done mainly by planted articles and news stories. In democratic societies this is achieved by a combination of officially inspired leaks and occasional plants by cooperative journalists. This channel has the advantage that all content is known to be monitored by foreign intelligence, hence it provides an open and direct conduit between the deceiver and his intended victim. Moreover, most information passed through this channel will be judged more-or-less credible even by a skeptical enemy. This is because one major function of mass media is to apprise sub-elites of certain facts and policies and any high proportion of entirely false information would prove dysfunctional. Compare, for example, the relatively high degree of convergence in information content on a controversial topic such as the CIA in such intensely and oppositely biased prestige publications as Ramparts and The New York Times. Military Radio Ever since 1915, one year after the innovation of field radio service on the Western Front, all major powers have systematically listened in on the official military radio communications of their enemies. Even today, when unbreakable codes are in common use for key messages, most tactical messages are still transmitted in “clear” or by simple codes or ciphers. Military radio messages are highly credible because they are an essential part of the military command-and-control net. However, dummy transmissions of disinformation can be introduced in any desired volume without any appreciable dysfunctional effect, because they can be explicitly addressed to nonexistent or witting units. Public Radio Same remarks as for Newspapers above. Diplomacy Diplomatic negotiations are often used to mask intended aggression by falsely indicating through both their fact and content that vital national differences are still negotiable. Both formal negotiations and “tacit” negotiations can be used to this end.34 To the extent that negotiations per se–and quite aside from their content–imply an unresolved decision to attack, they can also be considered as a non-verbal form of camouflage or diversion. Espionage Counterespionage (CE) organizations play an imaginative variety of disinformation games with enemy intelligence services. Two main modes of inserting disinformation may be distinguished: by planting it with double agents and by leaving it (usually in the form of documents) where the 33 See\n\nparticularly my Operation BARBAROSSA (69), and Case A53 (Bavarian Redoubt). only use for deception purposes of Thomas Schelling’s model of “tacit” negotiations of which I am aware was made by the Germans to cover their intended invasion of Russia in 1941. See Case A28 (BARBAROSSA). 34 The\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 1. STRATAGEM IN WARFARE enemy service is known to have gained access through his agents. Among the more rare and exotic variations are such things as planting authentic information on a “blown” or otherwise thoroughly discredited agent.35\n\n35 See,\n\nfor example, Case A45 (OVERLORD).\n\nChapter 2\n\nDECEPTION IN NATIONAL MILITARY DOCTRINES “If you want peace, understand war.” –Liddell Hart, 1932 Doctrine is the bridge between practice and theory. Having described the practice and practitioners of deception and before turning to its theoretical analysis, it is now appropriate to summarize its place in military doctrine. To reduce repetitiousness I will discuss this at the specific level of national doctrines, although it could be described in terms of “schools” of doctrinal thought that transcend national boundaries. Moreover, I have tended to limit my discussion in this chapter to the twentieth century, as the earlier history has already been sufficiently surveyed above.\n\n2.1\n\nBritish\n\nDeception seemingly did not appear in the British Army as a more-or-less standard practice until the beginning of the 20th century. Even the magnificent surprise-through-deception inflicted on the Marquis de Montcalm in 1759 by Major-General James Wolfe in scaling the “unscalable” Heights of Abraham was seemingly the very idiosyncratic concept of that one man,1 or rather as recent research suggests of one of his three brigade commanders, Brigadier Robert 1 B. H. Liddell Hart, Great Captains Unveiled (Edinburgh: Blackwood, 1927), pp. 206274. A possible influence on Wolfe was Saxe, whose Reveries appeared in its first English translation in 1757 in London while Wolfe was there. Moreover, as a subordinate officer, Wolfe had earlier faced Saxe in battle.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER 2. DECEPTION IN NATIONAL MILITARY DOCTRINES\n\nMonckton.2 Then, two generations later, came Wellington who has been characterized as a master of surprise-through-deception by one military scholar, himself a practitioner of that art.3 Although by the end of the Napoleonic Wars the British had produced their proportionate share of “notable Captaines stratagematique,” the art quickly died out. Unlike their Continental counterparts, the British masters of stratagem had not described their methods for future readers. Moreover, those Britons who were responsible for codifying military doctrine in the 19th century overlooked even recent experience, preferring instead to base doctrine on the fashionable popularization’s of first, the Jominian and, then, the Clausewitzian schools. Thus, as on the Continent did the very words “surprise” and “stratagem” quickly disappear from military texts. As the following summary will show, even the intermittently successful struggle through the first half of the present century to install strategic deception in professional doctrine was due entirely to a fragile chain of transmission from one teacher to another. Only after 1941 did it begin to diffuse through a few proliferating branches of the military network. As a tradition–however fragile–military deception returned to Britain from America. Lieutenant-Colonel G. F. R. Henderson was Britain’s most unorthodox military scholar in the 19th century. In his classic study of the American Civil War published in 1898 he identified a whole range of strategic (and tactical) ruses used by the Confederates, particularly the highly unorthodox General “Stonewall” Jackson, and to which he explicitly attributed their frequent attainment of surprise.4 Henderson was given the very rare opportunity to apply his purely academic theories to war when two years later he accompanied Lord Roberts into the hitherto disastrous military quagmire of the Boer War. As head of Robert’s Intelligence Service, Colonel Henderson devised the carefully coordinated plan of feint-and-deception that relieved Kimberley and permitted the move against Bloemfontein.5 It has significance for the rest of the story that a 29 year old Major named Allenby was present and an even younger Second Lieutenant named Wavell soon joined this company. At the outbreak of the Great War, the imaginative and innovative A. P. Wavell was placed in charge of M.O. 5, the key staff section of the Military Operations Directorate concerned with security, the secret service, ciphers, and general military intelligence. (At that time, the British Army combined Intelligence with Operations.) One of his many odd jobs was the “last-minute improvisation” of a field intelligence service, the Intelligence Corps. From September to November he was in France at British Expeditionary Force G.H.Q., personally commanding Intelligence Corps, whose 30 or 40 officers were distributed 2 Christopher Hibbert, Wolfe at Quebec (New York: 1959), pp. l14-133, 173; and C. P. Stacey, Quebec 1759: The Siege and the Battle (New York: 1959). 3 Colonel G. F. R. Henderson, The Science of War (London: Longmans, Green, 1905), pp. 102-103. 4 Lieutenant-Col. G. F. R. Henderson, Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War (London: Longmans, Green, 1898). 5 For deception in the Boer War see General Sir Archibald Wavell, Allenby, Vol. I (New York: Oxford University Press, 1941), p. 80.\n\n2.1. BRITISH\n\n15\n\nsingly or in pairs among the B.E.F. corps and divisions.6 This brand new Intelligence Corps virtually monopolized the keen advocates of stratagem during the Great War. However, for two very long years its superiors rejected its use as fit only for “comic opera,” as one put it during the instructive butchery at the Somme in 1916.7 Then, in 1917, on another bogged front, Allenby announced his arrival by unloosing a full bag of tricks–tactical and strategic–on the German and Turkish commanders in Palestine. There, on 31 October 1917, four months after his arrival, he launched his famed feint-cum-deception Third Battle of Gaza that thoroughly surprised General Falkenhayn and routed the off-guard and off-balance Turkish army, breaking an eight months’ stalemate and going on to take Jerusalem as trophy.8 Allenby himself had learned some of these tricks in the Boer War from General Roberts and his Intelligence Officer, Colonel G. F. R. Henderson who was, significantly, the authority on “Stonewall” Jackson. Now, at Third Gaza, his own brilliantly innovative Intelligence Officer, Major Richard Meinertzhagen, was to design his stratagems.9 “After the Meinertzhagen success,” as T. E. Lawrence wrote, “deceptions, which for the ordinary general were just witty hors d’oeuvres before battle, became for Allenby a main point of strategy.”10 Allenby repeated the initial success a year later, on 19 September 1918, at Megiddo. This time he used a similar pattern of feint-cum-deception but reversed the real line of operations to the coast. Coordinated with this were a series of feints and ruses by Major T. E. Lawrence to divert enemy attention inland to his trans-Jordan desert front. This strategy succeeded in unbalancing the smaller and weaker Turkish-German force and precipitated it into headlong flight. Seven days later all Palestine had fallen. Allenby’s unorthodox successes had been observed firsthand by Archibald Wavell. He followed the Palestine campaigns with admiring approval after the “dull, unimaginative, heavy-footed business” that represented the Western Front to him. Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Wavell had monitored the Third Gaza Battle, as Liaison Officer between Allenby and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. And, as Brigadier-General Wavell, he had served on the staff of General Chetwode’s XX Corps in the brilliant Megiddo campaign. Although the British had become the acknowledged masters of deception during the Great War, they had lost this technique–as they virtually had with military intelligence–by the beginning of World War II. The sole repository of such wisdom in a position of command was General Wavell, now the G.O.C.in-C. Middle East. Wavell had learned deception from Allenby in the Great War and had perfected its theory in his highly unorthodox inter-war training maneuvers.11 After the fall of France, Wavell put theory to effective prac6 John\n\nConnell [pseud. of John Robertson], Wavell (London: Collins, 1964), pp. 92-94.

DECEPTION IN NATIONAL MILITARY DOCTRINES\n\ntice in his rearguard defense against the over-cautious, semi-competent but far stronger Italian Army in the Western Desert.12 Finally, in December 1940, he proved its value by gaining the first British strategic surprise and victory of the war.13 Then, sometime in 1941 he sent one of his staff officers (probably Brigadier Dudley Clarke)14 to London to argue the need for the centralized inter-theater planning and coordination of strategic deception.15 The dreary failure of previous half-hearted cover plans such as at Dakar16 were vivid reminders of the need to improve such operations. Moreover, Churchill was quite willing to try out any unorthodox method that might supplement Britain’s militarily weak hand against the Axis. This proposal was adopted by the Chiefs of Staff who, following Wavell’s practice, created a small special deception planning staff committee under the Chiefs of Staff and directed that each theater commander would henceforward prepare a cover plan as an integral part of his proposed operational plan, the whole being coordinated at the center.17 It seems likely that Wavell’s revolutionary recommendation to upgrade and centralize deception was accepted because of the fortuitous circumstance that Churchill was then Prime Minister. Churchill was himself a quite unorthodox military thinker, always ready to consider (and sometimes overly willing to approve) the most outrageous innovations–such as tanks, amphibious warfare, guerrilla warfare. Also, as already noted, he was an earlier practitioner of stratagem.18 Lawrence and Liddell Hart had his ear and he was an early advocate of the “indirect approach”–indeed had independently conceived the outlines of this strategic doctrine as early as 1915.19 Moreover, during the extensive reorganization of the proliferated secret services in late 1941, Churchill was known to fully endorse deception, favoring it over even psywar, of whose utility he was wisely skeptical.20 Regardless of whatever his still unrevealed rˆole in the acceptance of Wavell’s 1941 proposal on deception planning, Churchill was quick to use it and to recommend its use to others, including both Roosevelt and Stalin. 86, 95, 142, 158, 200, 275; and Sir Ronald Wingate, Not in the Limelight (London: Hutchinson, 1959), pp. 189-204. 12 Collins (48), 268-270. 13 See Appendix A, Case A25 (Sidi Barrani). 14 Dudley Clarke (1899- ), a highly imaginative gunnery officer, one of the founders of the Commandos, whose name he took from his boyhood memories of the Boer War.

BRITISH\n\n17\n\nPiecing together the fragmentary data–often mere hints–that have crept through the Official Secrets Act, it becomes clear that the British located strategic deception at the heart of their planning process. As with the Germans, coordination was at the top. Lieutenant-General Sir Hastings Ismay, Churchill’s personal Chief of Staff revealed that deception was the province of a mere “handful of planners” who soon came under his supervision.21 The actual coordination of the various secret organizations–including PWE, SOE, and “deception”–was handled by Ismay’s No. 2, General Leslie Hollis.22 Ismay further identified his deception planners as the same ones who developed the Operation MINCEMEAT tidbit for the Sicily invasion in mid-1943 and the FORTITUDE deceptions (including the Monty’s Double ruse) attending the Normandy landings in 1944.23 Specific details about organization and personnel of the British deception planning group is even more vague. For example, it seems that it was, in fact, an intelligence group. For example we are told that by the summer of 1942 they were “a small inter-Service and interdepartmental committee which used to meet weekly to deal with questions of the security of intended operations.” The committee “comprised not only Regular officers . . . , but also temporary officers and civilians with most varied backgrounds,”24 but it is significant that the one or two identified members were both intelligence officers: LieutenantCommander Ewen Montagu, R.N.V.R., of Naval Intelligence and, seemingly, Squadron Leader Sir Archibald Cholmondley of Air Intelligence.25 Moreover, the only office location mentioned was “Central Intelligence Headquarters” in St. James Street. (However, this mention was in connection with a liaison meeting, so it may have been only an accommodation address.) This situation continued through at least the TORCH (North African) and HUSKY (Sicily) operations, that is until mid-1943.26 A latecomer to the group was noted theater critic Stephen Watts, who served in it as an Army Major from early 1943 to late 1945. He was in personal charge of the “Monty’s Double” ruse for Normandy. From his other assignments, it is clear Watts was in domestic counter-espionage, almost certainly the Security Service (M.I. 5) itself.27 An authoritative but puzzling clue was dropped by the official U.S. history of SHAEF. This reveals that “projects to mislead the enemy a"
