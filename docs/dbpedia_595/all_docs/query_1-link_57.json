        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhile it is not my intention to repeat the thousands of books written about the battles and campaigns of Europe during the Second World War, it is important to give a brief description of each campaign. For it was these campaigns that put the German generals and admirals on the map.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of war, Hitler had the support of most of the German General Staff, except for one man, General of Artillerie and Chief of the Army General Staff, Ludwig Beck. Beck, despite not joining the party, did support Hitler and his desire for rebuilding a strong German government, and even a stronger military. However, Beck felt that Germany needed more time and that the reoccupation of the German Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia itself would lead to a premature war that Germany was not ready to fight. Despite being Chief of the Army General Staff since the formation of the Wehrmacht in 1935, Beck’s hesitation and lack of support led to his forced resignation in August 1938. Hitler had no time for Reichswehr generals who did not give him their full support—Blomberg and Fritsch were also dismissed from the new Wehrmacht. With von Brauchitsch as the Commander in Chief of the Army, and General of Artillerie Franz Halder the new Chief of the Army General Staff, the Army was set for action and the last major obstacle for Hitler’s plans of aggression was out of the way.\n\nAfter the full invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, and pressuring its president Emil Hacha into submission, Britain and France made it perfectly clear to the Germans that the Flower Wars were over, and that the next act of foreign aggression would lead to military consequences. Hitler obviously wanted to avoid a war with Britain and France, both of whom proved to be troublesome adversaries during World War II. While the German navy, under Grossadmiral Dr. Erich Raeder, was still trying to rebuild from the binding regulations of the Treaty of Versailles, Great Britain had the largest and most lethal and modern navy in Europe. However, despite their naval power, Great Britain had a weak peacetime army, and an even weaker air force. It would take them months, at least, to mobilize a response against Nazi Germany. For the French, launching an offensive operation into Germany would be much easier due to their shared border. However, both France and Germany had built massive fortifications along their borders, the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line respectively. While the Siegfried Line was based more on obstacles for an invading army, France manned the Maginot Line with an elaborate maze of underground tunnels, artillery, pill boxes and fast responding troops. It was this fail-safe measure that kept French military concepts stuck in the World War I concepts of stationary warfare. Its primary purpose was to buy the French more time to mobilize in case of an enemy invasion.\n\nIt is possible that Britain’s and France’s lack of military preparedness gave Hitler some level of confidence that if war was declared on Germany for the invasion of Poland, it would merely be another war of words, and non-action, at least for the time being. Still, as a precaution, Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Stalin’s Russia, and was even willing to share the spoils of war by splitting Poland in two, with a joint invasion of Germany taking the west, and Russia taking the east. Having used another false pretense as an excuse to invade another foreign country, Hitler’s Wehrmacht embarked on the campaign that was to start World War II—the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939. Having amassed a massive army, and air force, the concept of General der Panzertruppe Heinz Guderian to use a fast and lethal combination of Panzer, Luftwaffe, and Ground Troops at the same time, was put into practice into what was to be known as The Blitzkrieg or Lightning War.\n\nThe invasion of Poland was to be the first real campaign of the Wehrmacht. The Germans had amassed two large army groups along the German/Polish border, with Heeresgruppe Nord under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, and Heeresgruppe Sud under Generaloberst Gerd von Rundstedt. Heeresgruppe Nord comprised of 3. Armee under General Georg von Kuechler, and 4. Armee under General Guenther von Kluge. Heeresgruppe Sud was a little stronger with three armies under its command: 8. Armee commanded by General Johannes Blaskowitz, 10. Armee under General Walther von Reichenau, and 14. Armee under General Wilhelm List. All these generals would reach higher levels of command, rank, and awards during the first three years of the war. Within these formations were 66 ground divisions, 9,000 field guns and 2,750 Panzers. The Luftwaffe contributed 2,315 aircraft.\n\nCommand of the Luftwaffe’s 2,300 aircraft for the invasion of Poland fell under Luftflotte 1 (Air Fleet 1) commanded by General Albert Kesselring, and Luftflotte 4 under General Alexander Loehr. As planned, the invasion started 1 September 1939, and as expected, was a swift combination of Panzers, artillery, troops, and aircraft which totally caught the Polish Army off guard. Not only were the Poles ill equipped to fight the modern war machine of the German Army, but the rapid advance caused full panic and total disarray for Polish defense forces. Nonetheless, there were pockets of resistance that put up a gallant fight and inflicted heavy casualties. Once the Russians invaded Poland from the east on 17 September, the fate of Poland and its army was a forgone conclusion. Warsaw fell to the Germans on 27 September, and the campaign itself ended on 6 October. Unlike the Spanish Civil War—into which Germany had sent a contingent of troops to assist Franco, the campaign in Poland was the first campaign to spill a significant amount of German blood. At the end of the campaign, Germany suffered 17,269 killed in action, and 30,300 wounded. Even though the tactics used in the Blitzkrieg might be considered reckless, on balance it may have saved thousands of German lives by preventing a long-drawn-out campaign as seen in the First World War.\n\nFollowing the invasion and defeat of the Polish Army, there was a bit of a stalemate, more due to the military intervention of Halder and Brauchitsh, as well as dumb luck, than Hitler’s desire. Hitler had wanted to invade France and the West in the winter of 1939 but, due to a staff member and an aircraft accident, the invasion plans fell into the hands of Western military forces. As a result, it was decided too risky and the Germans turned their attention to the north instead: Denmark and Norway. The invasion of Denmark was most likely the fastest invasion and victory of a country in modern warfare. On 9 April 1940, and in only six hours, the tiny country was overrun by a single army corps, Higher Kommando z.b.V. XXXI under the command of General Leonhard Kaupisch as well as miscellaneous support units. The country had been ordered to stand down, and its invasion was reminiscent of the Flower Wars in prewar Europe. However, the invasion of Norway, which also took place on the same day as the invasion of Denmark, was to prove to be much more complicated due to its geographic location and climate.\n\nUnlike Poland and Denmark, which shared land borders with Germany, Germany and Norway were separated by a body of water, the North Sea, which ran along the entire border of Western Norway. Since Germany had not yet invaded Russia and the Baltic States, the only way to access Norway was by air and water. Norway share most of its eastern border with Sweden, but Sweden was neutral. Much of Norway was mountainous, so it was vital that all three branches of service played an equal part. For the Kriegsmarine in particular, the conquering of Norway would provide endless opportunities for naval bases along its coast—vital for access to the Atlantic Ocean. For the land invasion, Germany used five infantry and one mountain division under the overall command of General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst’s Armee Group XXI. Facing them were a combination of Norwegian, British, French, and Polish forces. The foreign elements comprised an expeditionary force and would mark the first time that Great Britain and France would face off against German forces since their declaration of war on 3 September 1939.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine would play a vital part in the invasion. One heavy cruiser and light cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers, and other vessels transported the core group of fighting troops to their destinations throughout the Norwegian coast. Supporting the land and sea invasion was X Flieger Korps under the command of General Hans Geisler, comprising of over 1,000 aircraft, including 500 Ju-52s for additional troop transport. The X Flieger Korps was much larger than usual, and its 200 bombers, 40 Stukas and 100 fighter aircraft caused havoc on military positions and its troops. Despite the overwhelming odds, the Norwegian Army held their own with great defensive battles, the most notable being the battle of Narvik, a vital harbor for Norway. The battle involved the 3. Gebirgs Division under General Eduard Dietl and Luftwaffe support units against the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Norwegian, French, and Polish forces. Due to fierce resistance, the defensive battle could have lasted for several more weeks, if not months, but the military situation had reached a critical level, and it was decided that the Norwegian and Allied forces would abandon Narvik on 9 June 1940. General Dietl’s troops were the last men standing, and Dietl himself became a national hero and a personal favorite of Hitler. Considering the war lasted two months—Norway falling on 10 June 1940—German casualties were very light with 5,296 dead and wounded. The Kriegsmarine suffered the heaviest losses against the much superior Royal Navy. One heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, and ten destroyers among other surface ships, fell to the guns of the British Navy, something that the Germans could not afford to lose or make up quickly.\n\nWith the invasion of Denmark lasting only six hours, and the battle for Norway being half over, German land forces were amassing along its western borders for the invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940. The number of men and material used for the invasion of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands was so massive that only the future invasion of Russia could match in comparison. Over 3,000,000 German troops in 141 divisions were attached to three main army groups. Heeresgruppe A was under Generaloberst Gerd von Rundstedt and comprised of 45 divisions in 4. Armee (General Guenther von Kluge), 12. Armee (General Wilhelm List), and 16. Armee (General Ernst Busch). Their mission was to move through the Ardennes, bypass the concrete fortifications of the Maginot Line, and flood their forces into France. Heeresgruppe B under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock had 29 divisions within the 6. Armee (General Walther von Reichenau) and 18. Armee (General Georg von Kuechler). Their job was to invade Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. As for Heeresgruppe C under Generaloberst Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, its 18 divisions within 1. Armee (General Erwin von Witzleben) and 7. Armee (General Friedrich Dollmann), were to prevent flanking by the enemy and launch small attacks against the Maginot Line. Supporting these army groups were 7,300 artillery pieces and 2,400 Panzers.\n\nSupporting the invasion was a massive Luftwaffe presence comprising of almost 4,000 aircraft, which included 1,200 Fighters, 1,100 Bombers, and 324 Stuka Dive Bombers. Luftflotte 2 under General der Flieger Albert Kesselring comprised of I. Flieger Korps (General Ulrich Grauert), IV. Flieger Korps (General Alfred Keller), the Air Landing Korps including Parachute Troops (General Kurt Student), II. Flak Korps (General Otto Dessloch), and the 9. Flieger Division (General Joachim Coeler), were to support Armee Group A. Luftflotte 3 under General der Flieger Hugo Sperrle, the former Commander of the Legion Condor in Spain, was to support Armee Groups B and C. Within his Air Fleet were II. Flieger Korps (General Bruno Loerzer), V. Flieger Korps (General Robert Ritter von Greim), and I. Flak Korps (General Hubert Weise). The VIII. Flieger Korps (General Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen) contained most of the Stukas and other ground attack aircraft that operated independently throughout various parts of France and Low Countries when and where needed.\n\nOn 10 May 1940 all hell broke loose on the Western Front. Facing the Germans was a rather formidable enemy made up of French, English, Belgian, and Dutch troops that numbered over 3,000,000 men and had twice the number of tanks and artillery guns. It was important to have the element of surprise, as well as using the tactics of the Blitzkrieg. The German invasion was a two-phase attack with Case Yellow beginning on 10 May. In a rapid advance, Panzer units pushed through the Ardennes and along the Somme valley which cut off Allied forces and pursued them to the coast at Dunkirk. On 5 June, Case Red was activated with another German spearhead taking on the remaining 60 French and two British divisions that were stationed along the Somme and Aisne rivers. As expected, German forces along with the Luftwaffe destroyed the Allied forces as well as the Maginot Line and pushed through to Paris, which was declared an open city to preserve its historical significance. On 22 June 1940, the French government surrendered to the Hitler and his leading Generals of the Wehrmacht. During the six-week campaign, Germany suffered 49,000 dead and 111,000 wounded, while Allied forces lost 73,000 killed in action and 240,000 wounded.\n\nAfter the defeat of Poland, Denmark, Norway, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, it was time for Germany to regroup on mainland Europe and reorganize its forces. To have conquered so many countries in only ten months was unheard of in modern warfare. Not only did Nazi Germany make its presence known throughout Europe, but they also had a safety net of allies who shared similar beliefs—Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, and Finland had joined the German bandwagon in one way or another. The mood at home was beyond jubilant and Hitler was only too ready to shower praise upon those who made it possible. On 19 July 1940, during the victory celebration in the Kroll Opera House, Hitler promoted twelve men to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall for the first time in German military history. For the Army, Walther von Brauschitsch, Fedor von Bock, Wilhelm Keitel, Guenther von Kluge, Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, Wilhelm List, Walther von Reichenau, Gerd von Rundstedt, and Erwin von Witleben, were promoted to this rank. For the Luftwaffe, Albert Kesselring, Erhard Milch and Hugo Sperrle were granted the rank of Generalfeldmarschall. To his dear friend and closest ally dating back to the early 1920s, Hitler bestowed on Hermann Goering the unique rank of Reichsmarschall, making him the highest rank in the German Reich. In addition, Goering was also awarded the Grand Cross of the 1939 Iron Cross; he was to be the only recipient of this decoration. Not to be left out, Hitler also promoted many lower-ranking general officers and admirals from the Heer, Luftwaffe, and Kriegsmarine to higher ranks as well.\n\nWith the war in the West over, and the East already secure through non-aggression pacts and/or allies, military operations on mainland Europe came to an end. Except for the much smaller Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine, the Heer, or the main body of the German Army, took a major step of demobilization. England was no longer considered a threat and it didn’t take the 3,000,000 men who had been needed to invade France and the Lower Countries to occupy and keep order in Western Europe.\n\nHitler had always had a fondness for the English, and prior to the war, had many distinguished guests at the Berghof, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The last thing he wanted was a war with Great Britain. He felt that if he occupied the West, as well as control of the air with his Luftwaffe, and the Atlantic Ocean with the U-Boat Wolf Packs of the Kriegsmarine, the English would have no choice but to sue for peace. But unlike the forced consolidations and surrender of foreign countries during the Flower War, this ending was to have a much different outcome.\n\nThe British proved to have much more resolve than Hitler expected. Under the new leadership of Winston Churchill, who replaced Neville Chamberlain in May 1940, Great Britain was willing to fight to the last man and last round to preserve their freedom. Since a peaceful surrender was no longer an option, Hitler had the German Army High Command of Brauchitsch and Halder, plan for an invasion of Great Britain, something the Kriegsmarine under Grossadmiral Dr. Erich Raeder was not prepared for. At the start of the war, the German Navy was still rebuilding its surface fleet and had taken a back seat to that of the Heer and Luftwaffe. There was a much higher demand for German Army panzers and artillery, as well as fighter and bomber aircraft of the Luftwaffe. As a result, the number of surface ships and landing craft needed for the invasion was very limited, the latter of the two being non-existent. Their only saving grace was their fleet of U-Boats, which would sink anything in the Atlantic Ocean and English Channel that did not bear a Nazi flag.\n\nIn July 1940, with the Kriegsmarine playing a vital role in the water, Hitler started a new air campaign of terror against Great Britain. Without air superiority and control of the Atlantic, invasion of Great Britain on any level would be impossible. The jovial Hermann Goering, who had just come off a successful air campaign in Western Europe, was only too ready to please his master and send his Luftwaffe onto its next conquest. The Luftwaffe had at its disposal Luftflotte 3 under Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle, operating out of Paris, while Luftflotte 2 was stationed in Brussels under Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring. Luftflotte 5, primarily comprising bombers under Generaloberst Hans-Juergen Stumpff, was stationed in Norway and would later be used in bombing runs in Northern England. With 1,232 bombers, 406 Stukas, and 929 fighter aircraft split between the three Luftflotte, it was going to be all or nothing for the Luftwaffe.\n\nBombing missions started on 10 July 1940 against shipping ports, and surface ships along the English coastline. This was to later include infrastructure such as factories, airfields, military bases, and even London itself. While bombing and assault aircraft were terrorizing anything that was considered a viable threat, the British people endured. While dealing with bombings from the air, the R.A.F. was fighting the Luftwaffe in endless dogfights over the English Channel and British soil. Vastly outnumbered, in men and aircraft, they continued to rise to the occasion time and time again against German bombers and fighter aircraft. It was the advanced systems of British radar that would help navigate the air squadrons to where the enemy would show up next, thus helping their fighter arm achieve the element surprise time and time again. It was the combination of endurance, bravery, and technology that eventually wore out the German Luftwaffe, and after several repeated failures and postponements, the invasion of Great Britain was permanently shelved in the winter of 1941. For Hermann Goering, the loss over the Battle of Britain would be his downfall with Hitler. Never again was Hitler to trust his Reichsmarschall, and Goering began his fall into obscurity, being seen less and less at Fuehrer Headquarters.\n\nExcept for the continuous on-and-off air war between Germany and Great Britain, another victorious year for Nazi Germany came to an end. Hitler and his army conquered mainland Europe and the home front propaganda could barely contain itself. All of Hitler’s predictions and dreams came true, any doubts that his hesitant army commanders had, were now nonexistent. In the minds of the German people, the war in Europe was finally over. Like the Phoney War, where there were no military operations from October 1939 to March 1940, the German people were misled into the pretense of a false peace, one that the German High Command knew was nothing more than a brief respite of things to come. During this period between conflicts, Germany had time to rebuild the tanks and artillery it had lost, replace men who had been killed in action or were no longer fit for duty, and take advantage of the raw resources occupied Western Europe provided. This was the last year that Blitzkrieg would have any meaning of success. The British proved that despite Germany’s Lightning War of victories across Europe, that they in fact, could be stopped. It was the British resolve to stand fast that provided the groundwork for a two-front war—not taking care of the British when they had the chance would forever haunt the German High Command.\n\n***\n\nThe following biographies are arranged alphabetically, with each entry arranged as follows:.\n\nLast name, first name: highest rank (date of promotion), (branch of service); dates and places of birth and death.
