        "text": "Leonard Kaupitsch or Leonhard Kaupisch (1 September 1878 – 26 September 1945) was an officer of the German Army for 44 years, from 1898 to 1942. He is best remembered (to the extent that he is remembered at all) as the leader of Germany's 1940 invasion of Denmark during World War II. He served as military governor of Denmark until 1942, when he retired from military service. He died of natural causes in 1945, several months after Germany lost the war.\n\nLeonard Kaupitsch in The War That Came Early[]\n\nAs commander of German forces in Denmark, Leonard Kaupitsch set a very easy occupation policy, allowing the Danes to maintain their dignity and appearances of independence. Of course, everyone was aware that there was an iron hand within his velvet glove.[1]\n\nPeggy Druce attempted to meet with Kaupitsch to demand that he facilitate her departure from occupied Denmark, in accordance with Adolf Hitler's standing order that she be assisted in her passage to neutral countries. Druce did not meet Kaupitsch himself, but she did meet Major von Rehfeld, a high-ranking staff officer of the General's. Rehfeld assisted her in departing Denmark for Sweden.[2]\n\nReferences[]"
