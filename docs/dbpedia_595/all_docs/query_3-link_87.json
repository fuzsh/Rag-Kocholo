These camps were the collecting points tor thousands of transports converging from all directions. In three years the incoming traffic reached a total of close to three million Jews. As the transports turned hack empty, their passengers disappeared inside.\n\nT\n\n921\n\nThe killing centers worked quickly and efficiently. A man would step oft a train in the morning, and in the evening his corpse would be burned and his clothes packed away for shipment to Germany. Such an operation was the product of a great deal of planning, for the death camp was an intricate mechanism in which a whole army of specialists played their parts. Viewed superficially, this smoothly functioning apparatus is decep­ tively simple, but upon closer examination the operations of the killing center resemble in several respects the complex mass-production methods of a modern plant. It will therefore be necessary to explore, step by step, what made possible the final result. A salient fact about the killing center operations is that, unlike the earlier phases of the destruction process, they were unprecedented. Never before in history had people been killed on an assembly-line basis.1 The killing center as such had no prototype, no administrative ancestor. This is explained by the fact that it was a composite institution that consisted of two parts: the camp proper and the killing installations in the camp. Each of these two components had its own administrative history. Nei­ ther was entirely novel. As separate establishments, both the concentra­ tion camp and the gas chamber had been in existence for some time. The great innovation was effected when the two devices were fused. An exam­ ination of the death camp should therefore begin with its two basic com­ ponents and how they were put together. The German concentration camp wis born and grew amid violent disputes and struggles between Nazi factions. Even in the earliest days of the Nazi regime, the importance of the concentration camp was fully recognized. Whoever gained possession of this weapon would wield a great deal of power. In Prussia, Interior Minister (and later Prime Minister) Goring made his bid. He decided to round up the Communists. This was not an incar­ ceration of convicted criminals but an arrest of a potentially dangerous group. “The prisons were not available for this purpose”;2 hence Goring established concentration camps, which he put under the control of his Gestapo (then, Ministerialrat Diels). Almost simultaneously, rival camps appeared on the scene. One was set up at Stettin by Gauleiter Karpenstein, another was established at Breslau by SA leader Heines, a third was erected near Berlin by SA leader Ernst. Goring moved with all his might against these “unauthorized camps.” Karpenstein lost his post, Ernst lost his life. 1. The phrase was used by a camp doctor, Friedrich Entress, in his affidavit of April 14,1947, NO-2368. 2. Testimony by Goring, International Military Tribunal, Trial of the Major Hi?;· Criminals (Nuremberg, 1947), IX, 257. 922 KILLING CENTER OPERATIONS\n\nBut a more powerful competitor emerged. In Munich the police presi­ dent, Himmler, organized his own Gestapo, and near the town of Dachau he set up a concentration camp which he placed under the command of SS-Obertuhrer Eicke.3 Soon Himmler’s Gestapo covered the nonPrussian Lander, and in the spring of 1934 Himmler obtained through Hitler’s graces the Prussian Gestapo (becoming its “deputy chief’). Along with Goring’s Gestapo, Himmler captured the Prussian concentra­ tion camps. Henceforth all camps were under his control.4 Eicke, the first Dachau commander, now became the Inspector for Concentration Camps. His Totcnkopfrerbdnde (Death Head Units) be­ came the guards. Thus the camps were severed from the Gestapo, which retained in the administration of each camp only one foothold: the politi­ cal division, with jurisdiction over executions and releases. After the out­ break of war, Eicke and most of his Totenkopfverbande moved into the field (he was killed in Russia), and his deputy', the later Brigadefiihrer Glucks, took over the inspectorate. Eicke’s departure marks the midpoint in the development of the con­ centration camps. Up to the outbreak of war the camps held three types of prisoners:5 1. Political prisoners a. Communists (systematic roundup) b. Active Social Democrats c. Jehovah’s Witnesses d. Clergymen who made undesirable speeches or otherwise mani­ fested opposition e. People who made remarks against the regime and were sent to camps as an example to others f. Purged Nazis, especially SA men 2. So-called asocials, consisting primarily of habitual criminals and sex offenders 3. Jews sent to camps in Einzelaktionen After 1939 the camps were flooded with millions of people, including Jewish deportees, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, members of the French resistance movements, and so on. 3. See orders by Eicke, October 1, 1933, PS-778. 4. Camps for foreign laborers and prisoner-of-war camps were outside of Him­ mler’s sphere. However, in October 1944 Himmler tk over the PW camps in the rear. 5. By October 1943, 110,000 German prisoners, including 40,000 “political criminals” and 70,000 “asocials,” had been sent to the concentration camps. Himmler speech before Militarbcfehlshaber, October 14, 1943, E-70. ORIGINS OF THE KILLING CENTERS\n\nThe inspectorate could not keep up with this influx. Therefore, from 1940 on the Higher SS and Police Leaders established camps of their own, specifically the transit camps in the west and the labor camps in Poland. During the last stage of the destruction process, the Higher SS and Police Leaders also put up killing centers. At this point an office stepped in to centralize and unify the concentra­ tion camp network: the SS Economic-Administrative Main Office, the organization of Obergruppenführer Oswald Pohl. In a process that took several years, Pohl finally emerged as the dominant power in the camp apparatus. His organization incorporated the inspectorate and enveloped almost completely the camps of the Higher SS and Police Leaders. Pohl entered the concentration camp picture from an oblique angle. He was not a camp commander, nor was he a Higher SS and Police Leader. In World War I he had been a naval paymaster, and in the early days of the SS he had served in the Verwaltungsamt (Administrative Of­ fice) of the SS-Main Office. (The Verwaltungsamt dealt with financial and administrative questions for the SS.) On February 1, 1934, Pohl took over the Verwaltungsamt, and by 1936 he had expanded its activities. It was now concerned also with construction matters, including the con­ struction of SS installations in concentration camps. The Verwaltungsamt was therefore reorganized to become the Amt Haushalt und Bauten (Bud­ get and Construction Office) — the first major step toward overall control. In 1940 Pohl broke loose from the SS-Main Office and established his own main office: the Hauptamt Haushalt und Bauten. At the same time he set up a chain of SS enterprises in labor and concentration camps. This business venture could not be placed under the Hauptamt Haushalt und Bauten, which was nominally a state agency financed entirely with Reich funds. Therefore, Pohl organized another main office, the Hauptamt Ver­ waltung und Wirtschaft (VWHA) or Main Office Administration and Economy. This was Pohl’s second step. The double organization, which was analogous to Heydrich’s apparatus before the merger of the Haupt­ amt Sicherheitspolizei (Gestapo and Kripo) and the Sicherheitshauptamt (SD) into the RSHA, is shown in Table 9-1. On February 1, 1942, Pohl followed Heydrich’s example and com­ bined his two main offices into a single organization: the SS EconomicAdministrative Main Office, or Wirtschafts- Verwaltungshauptamt (WVHA). One month after this consolidation, Pohl took his third major step. To ensure better labor utilization in the camps and to make possible the unhampered growth of his SS enterprises, he swallowed the inspectorate. The WVHA was now fully engaged in the concentration camp business. From Table 9-2 it may be seen that Hauptamt Haushalt und Bauten (I and II) became Amtsgruppen A, B, and C, that the inspectorate w as trans-\n\nKXLLING CENTER OPERATIONS\n\nTABLE 9-1 ORGANIZATION OF THE HAUSHALT UNO BAUTEN AND VWHA\n\nHAUSHALT UND BAUTEN Office I Budget\n\nOffice II Construction\n\nObfi I for nor\n\nGruf.

The exploitation of the inmate labor supply, which had motivated Pohl to undertake this consolidation, now became the very reason for the exis­ tence of concentration camps. This factor brought into the lulling center operations the same dilemma that had already surfaced in the mobile killing operations and the deportations, namely the need for labor versus the “Final Solution.” This time the quandary was entirely an internal SS affair. (The growth of the Pohl organization from 1929 to March 1942 is summarized in Table 9-3.) The consolidation process did not stop with the incorporation of the inspectorate, for Pohl also bit into the camps of the Higher SS and Police Leaders. He annexed some camps outright, controlled others by install­ ing regional officials responsible to the WVHA (the SS economists [SSWirtschafter]),7 and invaded the killing centers in the Generalgouvernement by acquiring control over the entire camp confiscation machinery in the territory. Concentration camps had become the principal factor in the power structure of Pohl. He in turn had emerged as the dominant figure in the sea of concentration camps.8 6.

SS economists were installed in Riga, Mogilev, Kiev, Krakow, Belgrade, and Oslo, later also in Hungary. 8. See the essay bv Martin Broszat, “The Concentration Camps 1933-45,\" in 926 KILLING CENTER OPERATIONS\n\nWhile Pohl tightened his hold over the camps, the camps absorbed ever larger numbers of inmates. The following figures indicate the growth of the increasingly important army of slaves in concentration camp enclosures: September 1939: 21,4009 10 11 April 19,1943: over 160,000\"' August 1, 1944: 524,286\" The compilations do not include the camps of the Higher SS and Police Leaders, nor do they show the millions of deaths. To keep up with the influx of victims, the camp network had to be extended. In 1939 there were six relatively small camps.12 In 1944 Pohl sent Himmler a map that showed 20 full-fledged concentration camps (Konzentrationslajjer or KL) and 165 satellite labor camps grouped in clusters around the big KLs. (Again the camps of the Higher SS and Police Leaders were not included.)13 14 Himmler received the report with great satisfaction, remarking that “just such examples show how our busi­ ness has grown [Gerade an solchen Beispielen kann man sehen, me unsere Dinjjegewacbsen sind]''u Pohl’s empire was thus characterized by a three­ fold growth: the jurisdictional expansion, the increase in the number of camp slaves, and the extension of the camp network. The six killing centers appeared in 1941-42, at a time of the greatest multiplication and expansion of concentration camp facilities. During this burst of activity, the constoiction and operation of the killing centers could proceed smoothly and unobtrusively. The death camps operated with gas. There were three types of gassing installations, for the administrative evolution of the gas method had pro­ ceeded in three different channels. One development took place in the Technical Referat of the RSHA. This office produced the gas van. We have already observed the use of the van in Russia and Serbia. In both of these territories the vans were auxiliary devices used for the killing of women and children only. But there was to be one more application.

This move from concern for the individual to a preoccupation with society was accom­ plished by representing retarded or malfunctioning persons, especially those with problems perceived to be congenital, as sick or harmful cells in the healthy corpus of the nation. The title of one monograph, published after the shock of World War I, could in fact be read as suggesting their destruction. It was called The Release for Annihilation of Life without Value [Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens].17 The last three words of the German phrase were to grace official correspondence during the Nazi years. Not until after the outbreak of World War II, however, did Hitler sign an order (predated September 1, 1939) empowering the chief of the Führer Chancellery, Reichsleiter Bouhler, and his own personal physi­ 17. The authors were Karl Binding, a lawyer, and Alfred Hoche, a psychiatrist. (Sec 2d ed., Leipzig, 1922.)

Dr. Brandt, “to widen the authority of individual doctors with a view to enabling them, after the most critical examination in the realm of human knowledge, to administer to incurably sick persons a mercy death.”18 The intention was to apply this directive only to Germans with mental afflictions,19 but eventually the program encompassed the follow­ ing operations.20 1. Throughout the war, the killing, upon determination of physicians’ panels, of about 5,000 infants and children who were mongoloid, hy­ drocephalic, microcephalic, lame, spastic, or malformed. The children were removed from unsuspecting parents and from custodial institutions to specially organized pediatric units (Kinderfachabteilungen) in some thirty asylums and hospitals, where doctors administered luminal tab­ lets, occasionally with added injections of morphine-scopolamine, to in­ duce pneumonia, coma, and death. 2.

The administrative implementation of this psychiatric holocaust was in the hands of Bouhlefs Führer Chancellery. The man actually in charge of the program was a subordinate of Bouhler, Reichsamtsleiter Brack.21 For the technical aspects of the project, the Reichsamtsleiter obtained the services of Kriminalkommissar Wirth, chief of the Criminal Police office in Stuttgart and an expert in tracking down criminals.22 “Euthanasia” was a conceptual as well as technological and administra­ tive préfiguration of the “Final Solution” in the death camps. In the summer of 1941, when the physical destruction of the Jews was in the offing for the whole of the European continent, Himmler consulted with the Chief Physician of the SS {Reichsarzt-SS und Polizei), Gruppenführer Dr. Grawitz, on the best way to undertake the mass-killing operation. Grawitz advised the use of gas chambers.23 On October 10, 1941, at a “final solution” conference of the RSHA, Heydrich alluded to Hitler’s desire to free the Reich of Jews, if at all possible, by the end of the year. In that connection, the RSHA chief discussed the impending deportations to Lodz, and mentioned Riga and Minsk. He even considered the possibility of shipping Jews to concentra­ tion camps set up for Communists by Einsatzgruppen B and C in opera­ tional areas.24 The Ostland, emerging as the center of gravity in this 21.

By the end of the month the race expert (Sonderdezement fur Rassen­ politik) in Bräutigams office in the East Ministry', Amtsgerichrsrat Wetzel, drafted a letter in which he stated that Brack was prepared to introduce his gassing apparatus in the East. Brack had offered to send his chemical ex­ pert, Dr. Kallmeyer, to Riga, and Eichmann had referred to Riga and Minsk in expressing agreement with the idea. “All things considered,” wrote Wetzel, “one need have no reservation about doing away with those Jews who are unable to work, with the Brackian devices [Nach Sachlage, bestehen keine Bedenken wenn diejenigen Juden, die nicht arbeitsfähig sind, mit den Brackschen Hilfsmitteln beseitigt werden ] ”25 There were, however, some second thoughts about directing a continuing flow of transports to the icy regions of the occupied USSR.26 Dr. Kallmeyer, told to wait in Berlin be­ cause of the cold in the east, spent Christmas at home.27 The scene of the action had already been shifted to the Generalgouvernement. Under primitive conditions, three camps were built by Amt Haushalt und Bauten (after the reorganization of March 1942, the WVHA-C) and its regional machinery at Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka. The sites were chosen with a view to seclusion and access to railroad lines. In the plan­ ning there was some improvisation and much economizing; labor and material w ere procured locally at minimum cost. Belzec, in the district of Lublin, was the prototype. Its construction, according to Polish w itnesses, w'as begun as early as November 1941. A locksmith who worked in the camp while it was being built provides the following chronology:28 25.

ORIGINS OF THE KILLING CENTERS 933\n\nOctober 1941\n\nSS men approach Polish administra­ tion in town of Belzec with demand for twenty workers. The Germans select the site. November 1,1941 Polish workers begin construction of three barracks: a waiting hall leading tit rough a walkway to an anteroom, leading to a third building that had a corridor with three doors to three compart­ ments, each of which had floor pip­ ing and an exit door. All six doors (entry and exit) in these three com­ partments were encased in thick rub­ ber and opened to the outside. November-December 1941 A contingent of about seventy blackuniformed eastern collaborators (So­ viet prisoners of war released from cap­ tivity) lay narrow-gauge rail, dig pits, and erect a fence. December 22, 1941 Polish workers are discharged. January-February 1942 Watchtowers are built.\n\nThe Germans at the Belzec site who had requisitioned the Polish work force were members of an SS construction Kommando.29 The work was supervised by a “master from Katowice” an unidentified German with some knowledge of Polish who was in possession of building plans. When one of the Poles asked about the purpose of the project, the Ger­ man only smiled.30 Sometime before Christmas, the construction chief (.Bauleiter) showed the blueprints to an SS noncommissioned officer (Oberhauser) who was stationed in the area and who was going to be a functionary in the administration of the death camps. The drawings were plans of gassing installations (Verjjasungsanlqgen). By that time the con­ struction of the buildings was substantially finished,31 and shordy thereaf­ ter the chemist Dr. Kallmeyer arrived from Berlin.32 Sobibor, also in the Lublin District, was built, evidently more quickly, 29.

Superv ision of the construction was in the hands of Obersturmführer (later Hauptsturmführer) Thomalla, a master mason regularly assigned to the SS-Zentralbauleitung Lublin/Bauleitung Zamosc.33 Thomalla had some professional help from Baurat Moser, em­ ployed by the Kreishauptmann of Chelm (Ansel), in whose territory Sobibor was located.34 To speed the work, Jewish labor from the surround­ ing region was employed extensively during the construction phase.33 At Treblinka (within the Warsaw District), where euthanasia physician Dr. Eberl was in charge, the Zentralbauleitung of the district, together with two contractors, the firm Schönbrunn of Licgnitz and the Warsaw concern Schmidt und Münstermann (builders of the Warsaw Ghetto wall), were readying the camp.36 Labor for construction was drawn from the Warsaw Ghetto.37 Dr. Eberl also availed himself of the resources of the ghetto for supplies, including switches, nails, cables, and wallpaper.38 Again, the Jews were to be the unwitting contributors to their own destruction. 33.

ORIGINS OF THE KILLING CENTERS\n\n935\n\nEven while the three camps were being erected, transports with Jewish deportees from the Krakow District, the Reich, and the Protektorat were arriving in the Hrubieszow-Zamosc area. The director of the Population and Welfare Subdivision of the Interior Division in the Gouverneur’s office of Lublin (Turk) was instructed by the Generalgouvernement Inte­ rior Main Division (Siebert) to assist Globocnik in making room for the Jews pouring into the district. Turk’s deputy (Reuter) thereupon had a conversation with Globocnik’s expert in Jewish “resettlement” affairs, Hauptsturmführer Höfte. The Hauptsturmfuhrer made a few remarkable statements: A camp was being built at Belzec, near the Generalgou­ vernement border in subdistrict (Kreis) Zamosc. Where on the D^blinTrawniki line could 60,000 Jews be unloaded in the meantime? Höfte was ready to receive four or five transports daily at Belzec. “These Jews would cross the border and would never return to the Generalgouvernement [Diese Juden kämen über die Grenze und würden nie mehr ins Generalgouver­ nement zurückkommen]?39 The discussion, on the afternoon of March 16, 1942, was held a few days before the opening of Belzec. During the following month Sobibor was finished, and in July, Treblinka. The terrain of each camp was only a few hundred yards in length and width. The layout was similar in all three camps. There were barracks for guard personnel, an area where the Jews were unloaded, an undressing station, and an S-shaped walkway, called the Schlauch (hose), two or three yards wide that was bordered by high barbed-wire fences covered with ivy. The Schlauch was traversed by the naked victims on their way to the gassing facilities. The entire arrangement was designed to convince the Jews that they were in a transit camp, where they would be required to clean themselves on the way to the “east.” The gas chambers, disguised as showers, were not larger than medium-sized rooms, but during gassings they were filled to capacity. At the beginning, no camp had more than three of these chambers. The gas first used at Belzec was bottled, either the same preparation of carbon monoxide that had been shipped to the euthanasia stations or possibly hydrogen cyanide.40 Later, Belzec is re­ ported to have been equipped with a diesel motor; Treblinka is said to have had one from the start; and Sobibor began with a heavy, eightcylinder, 200+ horsepower, water-cooled Russian gasoline engine that released a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into the gas\n\n39.

KILLING CENTER OPERATIONS\n\nchambers.41 No crematoria were installed; the bodies were burned in mass graves. The limited capacity of the camps troubled SS and Police Leader Globocnik; he did not wish to get “stuck.”42 During the summer of 1942 there was congestion of railway traffic in the Generalgouvernement, and the line to Sobibór was under repair. At Belzec operations were reduced and inter­ rupted, and at Sobibór the stoppage was prolonged. But Treblinka re­ ceived transports to the point of overflow, and mounds of unburned bodies in various stages of decay confronted new arrivals of deportees.43 Between July and September an expansion was undertaken in the three camps. Massive structures, of stone in Belzec and brick in Treblinka, containing at least six gas chambers in each camp, replaced the old facili­ ties. In the new gas buildings the chambers were aligned on both sides of a corridor, and at Treblinka the engine room was situated at its far end. The front wall of the Treblinka gas house, underneath the gable, was decorated with a Star of David. At the entrance hung a heavy, dark curtain taken from a synagogue and still bearing the Hebrew words “This is the gate through which the righteous pass.”44 The Generalgouvernement was the location also of a regular con­ centration camp of the WVHA, where Jewish transports were received from time to time. In German correspondence the camp was referred to as Lublin, whereas its common name after the war was Majdanek. Up to 41. Ibui., pp. 133, 203, 165-66.

Information about the number and size of gas chambers in each camp rests not on documentation but on recollection of witnesses. There is agree­ ment that the new chambers were larger than the old (the capacity for simultaneous gassing in Belzec during the summer of 1942 was estimated at 1,500). Counts of gas chambers are given in the following ranges: Belzec 3, then 6 Sobibor 3, then 4, 5, or 6 Treblinka 3, then 6 or 10 It is likely that each facility was designed from the same basic plan; hence three is probably the initial capacity, and six the subsequent one. German defendants in lreblinka trial of 1965 (Franz et al.) indicated six chambers there after expansion. Ibid.

It had been built ■ to hold prisoners of war (among them Jewish soldiers of the Polish army,) under SS jurisdiction. Even during these early days, however, several thousand Jews, including men, women, and children, were brought into the camp from nearby localities. In September-October 1942, three small gas chambers, placed into a U-shaped building, were opened. Two of them were constructed for the interchangeable use of bottled carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide gas, the third for cyanide only. The area in front of the building was called Rosengarten and Rosenfeld (rose garden and rose field). No roses adorned the camp —rather, the SS managers associated the facility with a typical name of Jewish victims. The gassing phase, which resulted in about 500 to 600 deaths per week over a period of a year, came to an end with the decision to wipe out the entire Jewish inmate population in one blow.45 After the Lublin camp acquired admin­ istrative control of the Trawniki and Poniatowa labor camps, mass shoot­ ings took place at all three sites in the beginning of November 1943.46 While Kulmhof in the Wartheland was being set up with gas vans and a network of gas-chamber camps was established in the Generalgouverne­ ment, a third development came to fruition in the incorporated territory of Upper Silesia. There, in the corner below the convergence of the Vis­ tula and Sola rivers, the Polish army had maintained an artillery base encircled by stagnant fish ponds which permeated the compound with dampness, mist, and mud.47 After the Polish collapse, the German army 45.

At the begin­ ning of 1940 the Inspectorate of Concentration Camps, making a surv ey of the area, decided that with proper sanitary and structural improve­ ments the buildings might be used as a quarantine center.48 A few months later the SS moved in.49 Another concentration camp was born. Its name was Auschwitz. Its commander, a Nazi from the earliest days of the move­ ment who had come up in the concentration camp world with experience in Dachau and Sachsenhausen, was Rudolf Höss. The first inmates were Poles and the first distinct purpose of the camp was their local exploitation for economic purposes of the SS, including agriculture in the vicinity of the camp enclosure. To this end, the SS made a considerable effort to extend its influence into the surrounding territory. The land between the two rivers was consequently declared a “zone of interest” (Interessengebiet), and all the Polish peasants in the local villages were evicted. The aim was to establish a Gutsbezirk of the Waften-SS, a district owned by the SS, and conferences to this end were held over a period of two years. The complicated land-transfer process, comprising land of the Polish state, municipal property', ecclesiastical property, as well as property' belonging to Germans, could not be mastered, and on March 3, 1943, the Oberpräsident of Upper Silesia, Bracht, issued a decree estab­ lishing, in lieu of a Gutsbezirk, the administrative district (Amtsbezirk) of Auschwitz.50 Höss also became the chief executive of this Amtsbezirk.51 48.

A decision of the I. G. Farben Company to build a plant at Auschwitz led to an order by the SS construction chief Kammler to erect barracks for 18,000 inmates by the end of 1941J52 A branch of Auschwitz was founded outside the interest zone. It was called the Buna camp, descriptive of the synthetic rubber (Buna) that was to be produced there. Later it was also named Monowitz. Now there was a shortage of labor, and when Hoss made an agreement with the local Landrat for the seizure of Poles and Ethnic Germans who had refused work in the free market, the civilian prosecutor protested against this encroachment of his prerogatives.53 The invasion of the Soviet Union stirred Himmler into action. From the overflow of prisoners of war he wanted his share. The army agreed, and two sites were hurriedly styled SS prisoner-of-war camps: the Lublin camp (Majdanek) and Birkenau. The latter was a virtually empty expanse, about two miles from the main Auschwitz camp. Although Birkenau was “partially swampy,” it was thought that 125,000 prisoners could be held there.54 Such masses of men, however, did not materialize. Some 10,000 were marched from a nearby prisoner-of-war camp at Lamsdorf. Hoss had been told that they were the cream of the crop for hard labor, but by February 1942, almost all of them were already dead.55 In the midst of this ferment, a new development was introduced into Auschwitz: the final solution of the Jewish question. Hoss recalled that in the summer of 1941 he was summoned to Berlin by Heinrich Himmler himself. In a few spare words, Himmler told him of Hitler’s decision to annihilate the Jews.

Having placed this burden on the shoulders of Hoss, Himmler added: “We, the SS, must carry out this order. If it is not carried out now, then the Jews will later on destroy the German people.’'*6 During the following weeks, Eichmann came to Auschwitz, and Hoss attended a conference in Eichmann’s office about railroads and arrangements for trains.56 57 One of the details to be resolved was the mode of killing. The solution to that problem was serendipitous. Auschwitz served as one of the con­ centration camps to which the Gestapo brought selected Soviet prisoners of war and Communist functionaries for “liquidation.” One day, when Hoss was away on business, his deputy, Fritzsch, locked some of the prisoners into a cellar and killed them with hydrogen cyanide, a gas in stock for fumigation. The experiment was repeated when Hoss returned. The building (or “block” as it was called in Auschwitz), numbered 11, had to be aired out for two days, and the next gassing was therefore planned for a somewhat larger number of Russians in the cremator)'. Holes were made in the earth and in the concrete roof over the crema­ tory's morgue. After the cyanide was introduced into the room, some of the Russians shouted, “Gas!” and tried to break down the door, but the bolts did not give way. Hoss observed the corpses and listened to the explanations of the camp physician. The victims, he was assured, had not suffered in agon)'. He concluded that death from the gas was bloodless and that its use would spare his men a great psychological burden.58 56. Höss, Kommandant, pp. 157, 180-81.

Hoss does not recall the precise date of the meeting with Himmler, although in one of his statements, which is also his most confused, he mentions June. See his affidavit of March 14, 1946, NO-1210. Given the development of the final solution, June is unlikely. July may also be ruled out. Richard Breitman, reviewing Himmler’s traveling, specifies July 13-15 as the only time that month when Himmler was in Berlin. See his Architect ofCenocide (New York, 1991), p. 295.

Soviet pris­ oners sent to Auschwitz before October were communists and Jews selected, not for labor, but killing. No precise date has been advanced for the second gassing in Auschwitz.\n\nThe mortuary now became the first gas chamber. It was in operation, with an interruption for repair of the smokestack, for a year. Since the size of the chamber and the capacity of the two ovens were not sufficient for the task at hand, Hoss looked for a new location to carry out additional gassings. Accompanied by Eichmann, he found two small farmhouses in Birkenau that seemed suitable. Work was begun to fill in their windows. The interior walls were removed and special airtight doors installed. The two gas buildings were placed in operation during 1942, the smaller one in March, the larger in June. They were called Bunker I and II.59 Himmler visited the camp on July 17 and 18, 1942, with Gauleiter Bracht and the Higher SS and Police Leader of Upper Silesia, Schmauser. He watched a procedure from the unloading of the living to die removal of the dead at Bunker II. At that time he made no comment. Later, he sat in Hoss’s office and said that Eichmann’s transports would rise from month to month, that Jews incapable of work were to be annihilated ruthlessly and that the Gypsies too were to be killed.60 The bodies of the people gassed in the two bunkers were buried in mass graves. A survivor reports that in the summer of 1942 the corpses swelled, and a “black, evil-smelling mass oozed out and polluted the ground water in the vicinity.”61 From the end of summer to November 1942, the accumulated decomposing bodies infested with maggots had to be uncovered and burned.62 In the meantime the entire camp was in ferment. Auschwitz was con­ tinually under construction. Most of the work was planned and super­ vised by the SS-Zentralbauleitung Auschwitz, an organization of barely one hundred, including engineers, architects, technicians, and other per­ sonnel.63 The Zentralbauleitung was responsible for erecting all the SS installations and two plant halls that were to be used by the Krupp com­ pany.

The SS company Deutsche Ausrustungswerke (DAW) could undertake only simple carpentry. Consequently, about two hundred private firms were engaged, many for construction in the camp, the others as suppliers of materials to Auschwitz. Most of the companies were in Upper Silesia and their volume of business was small, but several of them were in Diisseldorf, Cologne, or Vienna, and a few had branches in several cities.66 Almost all the firms had to wrestle with multiple problems caused by wartime conditions: the allocation of material, which was a concern of the Speer ministry; the availability of freight cars for shipment, which was determined by the Reichsbahn; and the assignment of labor for Ausch­ witz projects, which was subject to the control of labor offices. In these matters the Zentralbauleitung attempted to support applications in order to expedite the process,67 but only the labor shortage could be alleviated on the spot by drawing on the inmate population. As of December 22, 1942, for example, the construction firms employed 905 of their own workers and 2,076 prisoners in the camp, while the Zentralbauleitung used an additional 5,751 inmates.68 The search for professional and 64.

In November 1941, the Zentralbauleitung was an amalgama­ tion of a Neubaulcitung in the main camp and a Sondcrbauleitung zur Errichtung eines Kriegsgefangenenlagers (a \"special construction directorate for the erection of a prisoner of war camp”). Generally, a Neubauleitung was created in a new concentra­ tion camp. The Sonderbauleitung was formed October 1, 1941, for Birkenau. 65.

Most of these struc­ tures were prefabricated horse stables assembled on bare earth without floors, and used for inmate housing and latrines.71 Temporary guard towers (without hygienic amenities) were to be replaced in April 1943 by 16 large, 45 medium, and 42 small structures.72 Throughout these ac­ tivities, tons of barbed wire were strung and electrified.73 It was in the course of all this construction that a new kind of edifice made its appearance. Four massive buildings containing gas chambers and crematoria were erected in Birkenau. They were to be the answer to Himmler’s admonition that more and more transports would arrive in Auschwitz. While under construction they were designated Bauwerke (Building Projects) 30, 30a, 30b, and 30c, and this numeration indicates that they were planned, not all four at one time, but in sequence.74 Bauwerk 30, the first in the set, was to become Krematorium II: the second Krematorium of Auschwitz. It was put on the drawing board in late 1941 when there was still an expectation of the large-scale delivery of Soviet prisoners of war.75 At that moment the Zentralbauleitung en­ visaged five ovens with three retorts each. After the flow of Soviet pris­ oners had stopped, the design was scaled back to two morgues in the cellar and only two furnaces on ground level. By February 27, 1942, however, the Jewish transports were in the offing. That day, Oberfiihrer 69.

KILLING CENTER OPERATIONS\n\nKammler visited the camp and decided that the five furnaces should be installed/6 Some time later several changes were made in the plans for the building. A chute for corpses was deleted and a staircase inserted. One of the morgues in the basement was turned into an undressing room. For the other the planners added a separate drainage system as well as ventila­ tion—the transformation into a gas chamber.77 While these modifications were projected in a succession of drawings, a third Krematorium, identical to the final version of the second, was planned. This structure, 30a, was to become Krematorium III.78 Finally, two more Bauwerke, 30b and 30c, were added. These buildings, which were Krematoria IV and V, did not have a cellar. Their gas chambers were on the surface, and as an economy measure each Krematorium was to have a double furnace with two smokestacks.79 The double ovens had been ordered bv the SS Construction Inspectorate in the area of the Higher SS and Police Leader Russia Center von dem Bach for Mogilev on the Dnepr Riv er, but they were diverted from that destination to Auschwitz.80 76. As of October 22, 1941, the Krematorium was to have five ovens, each with three retorts.

ORIGINS OF THE KELLING CENTERS\n\n945\n\nThe hydrogen cyanide, solidified in pellets, was to be shaken into the cellars of Krematoria II and III through shafts, and into the surface cham­ bers of Krematoria IV and V through side walls. In the gas chambers, the pellets would pass immediately into the gaseous stage. Thus an altogether more efficient system, which guaranteed much more rapid processing than in other camps, had been devised in Auschwitz. There was one drawback. The construction of these elaborate build­ ings required much more time than the erection of their counterparts in the Generalgouvernement killing centers of Sobibor and Treblinka.

On Janu­ ary 29, 1943, for example, the AEG bluntly told the Zentralbauleitung that the company was unable to obtain the best components for the supply of electricity in time, that equipment would have to be canni­ balized from other projects, and that this compromise would curtail si­ multaneous incineration and “special treatment” in Krematorium II.83 A stoppage in the allocation of freight cars, in turn, delayed the installation of ventilation equipment through the concrete ceiling of the “special cel­ lar” (Sonderkcllcr) of the Krematorium.84 The Zentralbauleitung com­ plained to the SS company Deutsche Ausriistungswerke on January 13, 1943, that carpentry work had not been completed and that doors for one of the units, “which was urgently needed for the implementation of spe­ cial measures [welches zur Dttrchfiihrung tier Sondermassnahmen dringend bendttjjt wird]\" were not finished.85 On March 31, another note was sent about a door that was to have a peephole, with a reminder that this order was specially urgent.86 After the Krematoria had been placed into opera­ tion, repairs were needed, particularly of the chimney in Krematorium II. On this occasion there was an argument between Engineer Priifer of Topf, who was responsible for the plans, and the firm Koehler, which carried them out. In the fact-finding attempt, even the senior German inmate supervisor had to be consulted.87 Finally, the two double ovens 83.

ORIGINS OF THE KILLING CENTERS\n\n947\n\ndiverted from Mogilev to Krematoria IV and V did not function very well.88 There was a reason for the feverish attempts to ready the buildings and to use them even with faulty parts. Throughout 1942, Auschwitz had received barely 175,000 Jews. The Generalgouvernement camps had swallowed more than eight times as many. The burial pits in Birkenau and in the Generalgouvernement were filling up or they were already full. In the first few months of 1943, more Jews were arriving in Auschwitz, but additional tens of thousands, from Macedonia, Thrace, France, and the Netherlands, were directed on longer routes to Treblinka and Sobibor, where no industry was located and no selection of the fittest could be conducted. Consequendy, Auschwitz was becoming the center of atten­ tion. Auschwitz had to come into its own. The status of Auschwitz as a focal point was underscored in a report by BischofF to Kammler on January 27, 1943. Referring specifically to die “implementation of the special action [Durchführung der Sonderaktion]” in Birkenau, BischofF noted an intervention by Hider himself: “Pursuant to a Führer order the completion of construction in the camp is to be carried out on a specially accelerated basis [Durch einen Führerbefehl ist der Aufbau des Lagers besonders beschleunigt durchzuführen] .”89 Two days later BischofF wrote encouragingly to Kammler that after die commitment of all available manpower and in spite of tremendous difficulties (unsagbare Schwierigkeiten), Krematorium II was now ready but for minor construc­ tion details {bauliche Kleinigkeiten).90 For an overview of the completed installations, see Table 9-4. If the construction of the gas chambers was a drawn-out affair, the laying of railway tracks for transports coming to Birkenau took even longer. The Auschwitz station, as part of the Upper Silesian network, was under the jurisdiction of Reichsbahndirektion in Oppeln. This Direktion, which had various offices also in Katowice and Sosnowiec, was headed until October 14,1942, by Präsident Pirath, who retired on that day, and then by Präsident Geitmann, an engineer. On frequent occasions, the SS Zentralbauleitung had direct dealings not only with functionaries of the Auschwitz station but with officials of the Reichsbahndirektion responsi­ ble for construction, operations, and traffic. Trains arriving in Auschwitz carried building supplies and raw mate­ rials for production, as well as prisoners. As early as the spring of 1942, when the prisoners were still unloaded at the railway station, the Zentral88. Prcssac, Auschwitz: Technique and Operation, pp. 386-90. 89.

Under a law of 1892, any tracks, including those owned by official agencies, were defined as “private” if they were not open to general traffic.93 The SS, therefore, had to have a budget, allocations of rails and ties, agreements with the Reichsbahn, and permis­ sion of the Regierungspräsident before it could proceed. By the beginning of 1943, the Zentralbauleitung unloaded thirty cars a day for construction materials alone.94 Höss had negotiated with the Reichsbahn for the use of an outside spur that had been put down by the railways themselves tor their own construction projects.95 The SS, how­ ever, wanted arriving transports to halt before the new gas chambers inside Birkenau. Tracks were to be laid through the guard building at the entrance, with gates that could be locked.96 On March 19, 1943, Höss explained to Oberreichsbahnrat Stabler that the tracks were needed “ur­ gently,” now that notification had been received of a heavier flow of transports.97 The provisional ramp had to be moved when the Reichs­ bahn was expanding its construction, and the SS had some anxiety that congestion might limit its unloading capacity to five transports a day.98 Nevertheless, there were more complications and interim solutions.99 91.

Construction was one-half of the problem faced by the SS. The gas supply was the other half. Hydrogen cyanide, or Zyklon, was a power­ ful lethal agent —a deadly dose was 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight. Packed in containers, the Zyklon was put to use simply by open­ ing the canister and pouring the pellets into the chamber; the solid mate­ rial would then sublimate. The Zyklon had only one drawback: within three months it deteriorated in the container and thus could not be stock­ piled.102 Since Auschwitz was a receiving station, always on call, it was necessary to have a dependable gas supply. The SS did not manufacture Zyklon, so die gas had to be procured from private firms. The enterprises that furnished it were part of the chemical industry. They specialized in the “combating of vermin” (Schddlinjisbekampfunji) by means of poison gases. Zyklon was one of eight products manufactured by these firms,103 * which undertook large-scale fumigations of buildings, barracks, and ships; disinfected clothes in spe­ cially constructed gas chambers (Entlausunjjsanlapjen); and deloused hu­ man beings, protected by gas masks.11)4 In short, this industry used very powerful gases to exterminate rodents and inseas in enclosed spaces. That it should now have become involved in an operation to kill oft'Jews by the hundreds of thousands is no mere accident. In German propa­ ganda, Jews had frequently been portrayed as inseas. Frank and Himmler had stated repeatedly that the Jews were parasites who had to be extermi­ 501, Opis 1, Folder 26, and other correspondence in ibid., Roll 32, Fond 510, Opis 1, Folder 186. 100.

ORIGINS OF THE KILLING CENTERS\n\n951\n\nnated like vermin, and with the introduction of Zyklon into Auschwitz that thought had been translated into reality. The operations of the extermination industry' were determined by three systems: the shareholding channels, the lines of production and sales, and the mechanisms of allocations to users. The company that developed the gas method of combating vermin was the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (German Vermin-combating Corpora­ tion), abbreviated DEG ESCH.105 The firm was owned by three corpora­ tions, and itself controlled two retailers (see Table 9-5). The capital investment figures shown in the table are no indication of the volume of business and profits. The DEGESCH profit in 1942 was 760,368 Reichsmark. From its HELI holdings alone, the DEGESCH re­ ceived 76,500 Reichsmark; from TESTA, 36,500 Reichsmark. In 1943, after the TESTA shares were sold, the DEGESCH made 580,999 Reichs­ mark, of which 102,000 Reichsmark were netted from the HELI invest­ ment.106 Every year from 1938 through 1943, excepting only 1940 and 1941, I. G. Farben received a DEGESCH dividend of 85,000 Reichs­ mark (200 percent). In 1940 and 1941 the I. G. made a profit of 42,500 Reichsmark (100 percent).107 The reasons for these outsized profits were threefold: a comparatively low overhead (DEGESCH had fewer than fifty employees), ever increasing demands of the war economy,108 and, most important, a monopoly. The Zyklon was produced by two companies: the Dessauer Werke and the Kaliwerke at Kolin. An I. G. Farben plant (at Uerdingen) produced the stabilizer for the Zyklon.109 Distribution of the gas was controlled by DEGESCH, which in 1929 divided the world market with an American corporation, Cyanamid.110 However, DEGESCH did not sell Zyklon di­ rectly to users. Two other firms handled the retailing: HELI and TESTA. The territory of these two corporations was divided by a line drawn from Cuxhaven through Öbisfelde to Plauen. The area northeast of that line, including Auschwitz, belonged to Tesch und Stabenow.111 (Schemat­ ically, the production and marketing of Zyklon is presented in Table 9-6.) 105.

On the whole, neither firm sought to invade the territory of the other, but on occasion Dr. Tesch supplied Dachau via Berlin.112 Allocation of the product to purchasers was the third factor in the workings of the industry. In a war, one cannot simply buy and sell. Each user has to show why he needs the supplies, and upon submission of such evidence, certain quantities are allocated to him. In other words, the territorial monopoly tells him where he has to buy, and the allocation system determines how much he can get. The central allocation authority was a committee in the Speer ministry. The committee divided the supply among export, private firms, and the armed forces. The Armed Forces Main Sanitation Park fixed the needs of the Wehrmacht and the SS,113 and the Waffen-SS Central Sanitation De­ pot was in turn responsible for allocations to SS offices and concentration camps.114 The working of this apparatus is illustrated in Table 9-7, which indicates the distributions of Zyklon to various users. 112.

Invoices presented to municipal or industrial clients for fumigations of buildings were printed with columns headed C, D, E, and F, each denoting a category of potency and price. As explained in a letter to the Ostland, strength E was required for the eradication of specially resistant vermin, such as cockroaches, or for gassings in wooden barracks. The “normal” preparation, D, was used to exterminate lice, mice, or rats in large, well-built structures contain­ ing furniture.115 Human organisms in gas chambers were killed with Zy­ klon B.116 The amounts required by Auschwitz were not large, but they were noticeable. At various times sizable portions of these deliveries were used for gassing people.117 The camp administration itself did not buy the gas. The purchaser was Obcrsturmftihrer Gerstein, Chief Disinfection Officer in the Office of the Hygienic Chief of the Waffen-SS (Mrugowski).118 As a rule, all orders passed through the hands of TESTA, DEGESCH, and Dessau. From the Dessau Works, which produced the gas, shipments were sent directly to the Auschwitz Extermination and Fumigation Divi­ sion (Abttilting Entmsung undEntseuchung).119 Notification generally came from Amtsgruppe D, which authorized the Auschwitz administration to dispatch a truck to Dessau “to pick up materials for the Jewish resettlement [Abholung von Materialien fur die Judenumsiedlung].”120 Deliveries to SS installations for fumigation purposes were made every six months or so, but Auschwitz required a 115.

To discerning eyes that frequency was noticeable too.121 The delivery system worked dependably until March 1944, when the Dessau Zyklon plant was bombed and heavily damaged.122 The sudden curtailment of the supply came at a time when the SS was making prepa­ rations to send 750,000 Jews to Auschwitz, the only killing center still in existence. A crisis developed. On April 5,1944, a Mrugowski representa­ tive wrote to DEGESCH requesting immediate shipment of 5 metric 121. Interrogation of Hoss, May 14, 1946, NI-36. 122.

The shipment had already been approved by the Armed Forces Main Sanitation Park and was “ur­ gently needed” (dringendst benötigt) by the Waffen-SS.123 124 125 A week later, Dr. Evers of Armed Forces Sanitation himself ordered about 6,000 lbs. and had them shipped to Auschwitz. TESTA hurriedly inquired who was to be billed.124 A DEGESCH official became worried that the production of Zyklon without odor ingredients would endanger the firm’s monop­ oly.125 The High Command of the Navv protested that it urgently needed Zyklon for the fumigation of ships.126 The SS in the meantime began to be concerned over the possibility that it had received the Zyklon too early. On May 24, the disinfection officer, Obersturmführer Gerstein, wrote a letter to Dr. Peters inquiring how long the shipment would last. When would it deteriorate? So far, it had not been used at all. “On the other hand, under certain circumstances large quantities — that is to say, actually the entire quantity — might have to be used all at once [Andereseits werden erhebliche Mengen — d.h. eigentlich die ganzen vem>ahrtcn Mengen — unter Umständen plötzlich benötigt] ,”127 The SS did not have to wait too long. By end of May transports were rolling into Auschwitz, and on August 6 the Referat für Schädlingsbe­ kämpfung der Waffen-SS und Polizei in Auschwitz (Anti-vermin Office of the SS and Police in Auschwitz) asked for more Zyklon.128 The supply was kept up to the very end. The SS did not run out of gas. The gas-killing method had evolved through three separate channels, each more advanced than the previous one: first the carbon monoxide gas vans, then the carbon monoxide gas chambers, and finally the hydrogen cyanide (or Zyklon) combination units. The advantages of Zyklon as a lethal gas became known. Even while Höss was still building his gas chambers in 1942, a distinguished visitor from Lublin, Brigadeführer Globocnik, visited Auschwitz in order to learn of the new method.129 The Höss discovery posed an immediate threat to his Generalgouvernement rival, Kriminalkommissar Wirth. This rivalry' came to a head one day in August 1942 when Eichmann’s deputy', Günther, and the chief disinfection officer, Kurt Gerstein, arrived in Belzec. They had about 200 pounds of Zyklon with them and were 123. Brcmcnburg to Peters, April 5,1944, NI-9909. 124. Dessau to DEGESCH, April 11, 1944, NI-9913. TESTA to DEGESCH, April 11, 1944, NI-9096.
