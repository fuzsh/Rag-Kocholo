They are sent to strike deep into the Citadel of the Nepharite Alakhai, whose corrupt Dark Legion forces are trying to conquer the solar system. In the depths of this Citadel, Doomtroopers battle Alakhai’s Dark Legion, perform perilous missions, and attempt to outdo the other Corporation teams as they take their heroic stand to save Mankind.

SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 8\n\nSETUP STEP 1. CORPORATION SELECTION Each player picks a Corporation to play, takes a player tray, Corporation identification marker, Corporation tokens, and the Doomtroopers for that Corporation. (See Corporation rank cards.) STEP 2. DETERMINE DARK LEGION PLAYER Each player places their identification marker, face-down together with the other player markers. Mix the markers. Randomly select one of the markers and turn it over. The player of that Corporation is designated the Dark Legion player for this mission and for this mission takes the Dark Legion identification marker. - When playing a single mission, a player with more game experience may be the best choice to play the Dark Legion player, especially if there are a number of first time players. - When playing a campaign, the role of the Dark Legion player changes from mission to mission. Over the course of a campaign, each player has the opportunity to control the forces of the Dark Legion. STEP 3. MISSION SELECTION Select a mission from the mission book. Different missions have different requirements, goals, and levels of difficulty. - When playing a single mission, any mission can be selected. - When playing a campaign, players may want to start with mission number one and advance to the next mission as they advance the storyline. (See Missions.) STEP 4. BUILD MISSION MAP Set up the game board sector tiles according to the mission diagram. Then, position the white entrance tokens for the Doomtroopers and the red entrance tokens for the Dark Legion reinforcements next to the relevant entrance points as shown in the diagram. It is very important that the sector tiles and the Citadel are arranged exactly the way they are illustrated. STEP 5. EVENT CARDS The Dark Legion player sorts through the event cards and takes the card numbers listed under the Time Limit section of the mission brief. The event cards not listed are not used in the mission. The Dark Legion player then shuffles the event cards and draws one event card for each round listed under the mission’s Time Limit to create the event card deck for the mission. Place these cards face-down in a pile in front of the Dark Legion player. The remaining event cards are not used in the mission. Game setup depends on the type of game the players wish to play: a single mission or a campaign. - Single mission games are one-time sessions with a winner declared after the mission is completed. Promotion points earned during a single mission are used to determine a winner, but do not need to be tracked between games. - A campaign is played over a series of missions linked together in an ongoing story. Each player represents one of the Corporations for the entire campaign, and promotion points are tracked game-to-game. The Doomtroopers become more experienced, gain access to more powerful gear, and face more dangerous Dark Legion forces. With a few exceptions, the rules are the same whether playing a single mission or a campaign. Differences are noted where applicable. A Dark Legion Citadel on the surface of Venus. RULE BOOK 9\n\nSTEP 6. FORCE CARDS The Dark Legion player sorts through the force cards and takes the card numbers listed under the Dark Legion Resources section of the mission brief. The force cards not listed are set aside and are not used in the mission. After the force card deck is created, the Dark Legion player shuffles these cards and places the force cards on sector tiles as instructed by Dark Legion Resources. The remaining force cards form a draw pile and are placed in front of the Dark Legion player. STEP 7. DETERMINE RANK The rank of the Corporation players and Dark Legion player depends on whether it is a single mission or a campaign. - When playing a single mission game, there is no need to track rank and promotion points between missions. The players decide the rank of all the players before the mission starts. - When playing a campaign, all players keep their accumulated rank and promotion points from the previous missions. Each player places their promotion point tracking peg to the corresponding number. If this is the first mission of a new campaign, the players start at Rank 1 and the promotion point tracking peg is placed on the zero ‘0’ space. After determining their rank, all players place the corresponding rank card in the lower card slot of their player tray. The rank card shows the combat dice, defense die, credits, and number of Doomtrooper cards available at this rank. (See Coporation rank cards.) If at the start of a mission, one Corporation player has a greater rank and more promotion points than any other player, they receive the commander token and place it in front of them for the duration of the mission. Note: All players, including the Dark Legion player, track their rank and promotion points continuously during each mission on their player trays. STEP 8. DARK LEGION CREATURES The Dark Legion player commands the Dark Legion creatures. Take the Dark Legion identification marker and the appropriate Dark Legion reference board according to the rank of the Corporation player with the second-highest rank and promotion points. (See Dark Legion reference board.) If teams are tied for highest rank and promotion points, their ranks determine the rank of the Dark Legion reference board. If there is only one Corporation player, their rank determines the appropriate Dark Legion reference board. Note: The appropriate Dark Legion reference board is determined at the start of a mission and will not change during the course of a single mission. Additionally, it is not determined by the rank of the Dark Legion player for this mission. STEP 9. CORPORATION PLAYER TRAY SETUP While the Dark Legion player prepares their forces, the Corporation players set up their player trays. Each Corporation player chooses two Doomtrooper characters from the team of three available characters and places the corresponding Doomtrooper character cards in the card slots provided on the tray. Doomtroopers not selected are returned to the box. They will not be used during the current mission. Each Doomtrooper begins a mission at full health. The Corporation players place a peg on the “5” space on the health track for their Doomtroopers. Note: The Corporation players may choose different Doomtroopers for each mission. In fact, the mission selected during Step 3 may influence which Doomtroopers they choose. The players are allowed to discuss their choices and work together to make sure the Corporations send Doomtroopers with different specialties on the mission. Mitch Hunter cutting through Undead Legionnaires. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 10\n\nSTEP 10. EQUIPMENT SELECTION Now the Corporation players select equipment cards for their Doomtroopers. (See Equipment Bunker.) The current rank of a Corporation’s Doomtrooper team determines the number of credits a team has, in order to acquire equipment, as well as which equipment cards are available to them from the Equipment Bunker (equipment card deck). Some weapons and equipment require a team to achieve a certain rank before a weapon card or equipment card can be selected. The equipment deck is organized by rank. A Doomtrooper team receives the credits listed on their rank card at the start of each mission. Equipment may only be purchased at the start of a mission and any left-over credits are lost. At the end of each mission, all equipment cards are returned to the Equipment Bunker. Each Doomtrooper has an attack specialty in either close combat, firearms, or tech as determined by the icon on their character card. If a weapon card does not share the same icon as the Doomtrooper’s specialty, they cannot equip that item. -In a single mission, the Corporation player to the left of the Dark Legion player makes the first selection and continues with the player to their left. -In a campaign, the team with the lowest rank and fewest number of promotion points makes the first selection, followed by the next lowest, and so on. If there is a tie (such as in the first mission in a campaign), shuffle the tied Corporation’s tokens and randomly draw to determine the turn order. After making the first selection, the deck is passed to the next Corporation in order. The deck continues to be passed around in this way, with each player selecting one card at a time, until all players have used all of their credits. After selecting a card from the Equipment Bunker, that player must allocate that piece of equipment to one of their Doomtroopers. The cards are placed on the appropriate weapon or equipment space on the same side of the tray as the Doomtrooper who will carry that piece of equipment or weapon. During a mission, when a Doomtrooper is eliminated, all equipment they were carrying is lost and returned to the equipment card deck. Equipment may not be given or exchanged between Doomtroopers during a mission. Note: The Dark Legion player does not select equipment. Note: Players may not select equipment cards their Doomtroopers cannot equip in order to deny them to other players. Each card selected must be assigned to an eligible Doomtrooper or returned to the Equipment Bunker. STEP 11. DEAL SECONDARY MISSION CARDS If the mission brief indicates the use of secondary missions, the secondary mission cards are shuffled together. Then each Corporation player draws two secondary mission cards and chooses one for the mission, unless otherwise stated in the mission brief. (See Secondary Mission Cards.) If the mission brief does not indicate the use of secondary missions, these cards are returned to the box. They will not be used during this mission. STEP 12. DEAL DOOMTROOPER CARDS During a mission, each Doomtrooper has access to special abilities and tactics, referenced on the relevant Corporation rank card. The Doomtrooper cards are shuffled together and each Corporation player draws the number of Doomtrooper cards indicated on their rank card. (See Doomtrooper Cards.) Once all these steps have been completed, the players are ready to begin the mission. Example Cybertronic player tray setup QUICK START EQUIPMENT New players can use a quick start card for their Corporation and select default equipment. RULE BOOK 11\n\nStanding tall and proud on the observation platform, Cardinal Nathaniel Durand appeared to dwarf both the supreme military leaders of the human race surrounding him and the elite guard flanking them all. The commanders were peering west using binoculars of every imaginable shape. Even fifty kilometers distant from the Citadel’s heart, the barrages sounded like an endless thunderclap. Entire divisions of howitzers and mortars were making an endless, earth-shaking din, though even that was occasionally dimmed by the roar of a siege-gun. Armadas of aircraft above added to the cacophony, while thousands of muzzleflashes turned the night into day. It was beyond awe-inspiring and beyond words; it was madness. “Master Durand,” roared a Bauhaus artillery general. “Big Bertha hit the central spire! Spot on! A twoton grenade!” “I saw that,” answered Nathaniel calmly, his deep voice somehow eclipsing the din. “I guess you woke Alakhai up! Good work!” As Nathaniel Durand and his brothers laughed, it began to grow on some of the generals that the Durand brothers were enjoying themselves… EXAMPLE FIRST MISSION SETUP SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 12\n\nDARK LEGION PLAYER TURN OVERVIEW: The Dark Legion’s turn consists of performing the following steps, in order. 1. Draw one event card and follow its instructions. 2. Place any indicated reinforcements, if available, at entry points off the board. Valid entry points are indicated on the mission map and by red entrance tokens. 3. If there are any remaining face-down force cards on any sector tiles, choose one force card and turn it over. Then place the corresponding Dark Legion creatures on that sector tile. 4. Perform up to 2 actions with each Dark Legion unit. Like Doomtroopers, Dark Legion units may MOVE and/or ATTACK in any order. The Dark Legion player must complete all actions with one of their units before activating a different unit. 5. If applicable, discard the Event card. Note: Some powerful enemies may perform more than 2 actions. For example, the Nepharite and the Ezoghoul may perform up to 3 actions Siege of the Citadel is played in rounds. During a round, each Doomtrooper team and the Dark Legion player take one turn. After all players have completed their turn, the round ends. STEP 1. DETERMINE PLAYER ORDER Turn order is determined by drawing Corporation and Dark Legion identification markers. At the beginning of each new round, all of the identification markers are placed face-down, and one is selected at random. STEP 2. INDIVIDUAL PLAYER TURN Each player takes their individual turn when their Corporation or Dark Legion identification marker is drawn. The actions they perform on their turn depends on whether they are a Corporation or the Dark Legion player. A new identification marker is only revealed after the current player has completed their turn. Then, Step 1 and Step 2 are repeated until all players have taken an individual turn, then proceed to Step 3. STEP 3. CHECK FOR END OF MISSION After all players have had their identification marker drawn and individual turns have been completed, next they check to see if the current mission has been completed. Missions have specific goals the Corporation players must achieve to complete and win the mission. Many missions have a time limit and if the Corporation players’ specific mission goals have not been completed within that time limit, the Dark Legion player wins. OVERVIEW OF PLAY CORPORATION PLAYER TURN OVERVIEW: When a Corporation player’s token is drawn, they may activate both of their Doomtroopers. The Doomtroopers may be activated in any order, but one Doomtrooper’s actions must be completed before another Doomtrooper is activated. Each Doomtrooper performs up to 2 actions. They may MOVE and/or ATTACK in any order. (For example, a Doomtrooper may move twice, or attack and then move, or attack twice, etc.) Some missions require a Doomtrooper to perform a SPECIAL action to fulfill mission objectives. SPECIAL actions can be swapped in for a MOVE or ATTACK action at any time. A player may also play one Doomtrooper card on their turn. A Doomtrooper card may be played to give one of their Doomtroopers an extra action or used for its text effect, but not both. (See Doomtrooper Cards.) A Citadel of Alakhai emerges on Venus. RULE BOOK 13\n\nDOOMTROOPER CARDS During their turn, a Doomtrooper card may be discarded to allow one of their Doomtroopers to take one additional action or it may be played for the special effect indicated by the card’s text, but not both. A Corporation player may use only one Doomtrooper card on their turn, regardless of whether it is used for an additional action or for the card’s text effect. Discard any Doomtrooper card once they have been played and their effects resolved. Note: Some special Doomtrooper cards are played on another player’s turn. These cards are not affected by this restriction. DETERMINE PLAYER ORDER: Player order for the round is determined by randomly drawing one identification marker from the pool of Corporation and Dark Legion player markers. Step 1. The players place their Corporation identification markers face-down, along with the Dark Legion player’s marker. Mix the face-down markers. Step 2. Select one of the markers and turn it face up. Step 3. The player whose marker is drawn takes their turn. Once that player completes their turn, select another marker for the next player’s turn. After the last marker is revealed and that player’s turn is completed, the current round ends. To start the next round, place all the markers face-down, mix them together, and start the sequence again. It takes a number of rounds to determine a winner. The event cards usually track the number of rounds remaining before a mission must be completed. If both of a Corporation player’s Doomtroopers are eliminated, remove that player’s Corporation marker from the mix. That player no longer participates in the current mission. CORPORATION PLAYER TURN DETAILS: The first time a player’s Corporation identification marker is drawn, the player places both of their Doomtroopers outside one sector tile, next to the white entrance tokens, as indicated on the mission map. - Both Doomtroopers must enter through the same entrance. - The player places one of their Corporation tokens next to their entrance. - More than one player can use the same entrance. During their turn, the two Doomtrooper’s of each Corporation player perform up to two actions each: MOVE and/ or ATTACK. - A Doomtrooper may perform these actions in any order. - A Doomtrooper may perform the same action more than once. - One Doomtrooper must complete all of their actions before another Doomtrooper acts. Some Equipment cards, missions, or abilities allow a Doomtrooper to perform a SPECIAL action. A SPECIAL action can be substituted for a MOVE or ATTACK action. RULES OF PLAY Imperial Doomtroopers start each mission with additional Doomtrooper cards. Imperial forces engaging a Razide. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 14\n\nMAP DETAILS Unless specifically described in a mission brief, fixtures and fittings printed on a sector tile (such as boxes, barrels, tubes, statues, chairs, or tables) do not stop or block movement. Squares which are completely obstructed (such as debris) or completely vacant (such as a pit) cannot be moved onto. In addition, these items do not block line of sight or provide any protection during an attack. DOORS Doors are a special type of terrain. Doomtroopers may move through doors as part of a Move action, at no additional cost. However, the first Doomtrooper to move through a door represented by a door token must draw a door card to see if the door was trapped. Once the door card is resolved, replace it in the deck and shuffle. If a Doomtrooper Tech specialist is the first Doomtrooper to move through a door any trap present is automatically disabled and no door card is drawn. After moving through a door, whether or not a trap was triggered, the door token is removed from the map. Doors may not be attacked, unless otherwise stated. FORCE CARD SPAWNS When a Doomtrooper team ends a Move action on a map sector tile for the first time, reveal one force card in that sector and mark the sector with the appropriate Corporation token. Other force cards remain face-down until other Doomtrooper teams enter the sector tile. The Dark Legion player places the figures listed on the card in any squares in that sector, except for squares adjacent to a Doomtrooper. These Dark Legion figures may not move or attack until it is the Dark Legion player’s turn. When a force card lists figures that are not available in the Dark Legion Player’s figure pool, the placement of those figures is ignored. Once all the figures are deployed, the force card is placed face-up on the discard pile. If the force card draw pile is depleted, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile. A Doomtrooper may move up to 3 squares in any direction per Move action, including diagonally. They may move diagonally between two figures. A Doomtrooper may not move through a Dark Legion creature or walls. They may move through their own Corporation’s Doomtroopers. They may move through other Corporation Doomtroopers if they have permission from that Corporation’s player. If a Doomtrooper moves off the map and is no longer on a sector tile, it is out of play for the rest of the mission. A Doomtrooper may not end a Move action on the same square as another Doomtroooper, a Dark Legion creature, a trap, a turret, or any other token unless explicitly stated. BLOCKING If a Doomtrooper starts a Move action adjacent to one or more Dark Legion figures, that Doomtrooper is blocked and may only move 2 squares. Dark Legion figures behind walls do not block Doomtroopers . Example: A Cybertronic Doomtrooper (green) is blocked by 2 adjacent Dark Legion figures (red) and may only move up to 2 squares (instead of 3) during its Move action. Dark Legion figures are not blocked by Doomtrooper figures or other Dark Legion figures. MOVE ACTION Vince Diamond in action. RULE BOOK 15\n\nATTACK SEQUENCE DETERMINE COMBAT DICE Doomtroopers attack by rolling combat dice of the same color as the dice shown on their rank card. The type of atttack (firearm, close combat, or tech) and number of combat dice rolled are shown on each Doomtrooper’s weapon card. If a weapon card indicates 3 combat dice, all 3 of the combat dice shown on the player’s rank card are rolled to determine successes. When a weapon card indicates fewer than 3 combat dice are used, the Doomtrooper player may choose any combination of combat dice from those shown on the player’s rank card. When an attack uses more than 3 combat dice, the number and color of the extra combat dice are listed on the weapon card. ROLL AND RESOLVE COMBAT DICE Once the number and color of combat dice are determined, the player rolls the combat dice and counts the number of hits (explosion icons) rolled. If the number of hits is greater than the target’s defense value then the attack is a success. Successful attacks inflict damage for the number of hits rolled above the target’s defense value after modifiers and re-rolls have been applied. ATTACK ACTIONS Doomtrooper characters perform Attack actions to engage Dark Legion creatures in combat or in an attempt to hack the Citadel. A figure can only make one type of attack (firearm, close combat, or tech) during an Attack action. For each Attack action the attacker declares one enemy figure as the target of the attack. Some equipment cards or Doomtrooper cards may allow a figure to target more than one enemy figure at a time. A figure cannot perform an Attack action if it is off the map. A figure can attack an enemy figure on a different sector tile. ATTACK TYPES Combat between the Corporation Doomtroopers and minions of the Dark Legion is tense and dangerous! This fierce combat is resolved with Attack actions. There are three different types of Attack actions in Siege of the Citadel: Close Combat, Firearm, and Tech. Each type of attack is resolved using the combat dice, defense, and damage rules discussed in this chapter. However, there are several special rules that make each type distinct, as noted in their descriptions. Example: a close combat attack with a plasma carbine indicates 1 combat die , therefore the Doomtrooper player may choose any one of the three combat dice shown on their player rank card to roll. At player rank 2, the Doomtrooper may choose a red die or a white die for their one combat die. Example: a close combat attack with a Punisher Shortsword indicates 3 combat die , therefore the Doomtrooper player rolls all three combat dice shown on their player rank card to roll. At player rank 2, this is two white dice and one red dice . Example: a Punisher Shortsword rolls against a target with defense 1, the attack inflicts 1 damage. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 16\n\nCOMBAT RE-ROLLS A number of Corporation powers, Doomtrooper cards, or other effects allow a player to re-roll one or more combat dice. After the initial combat dice roll, the player chooses which of their combat dice to re-roll before the attack is resolved. Re-rolled dice cannot be re-rolled again if the player has more re-roll effects to apply. ARMOR CHECK The defense value of some targets also shows a die. These targets may cancel 1 point of damage by rolling a hit icon on their defense die. This is in addition to any defense value number listed. If after rolling defense dice, all points of damage are cancelled, the target suffers no damage and the attack is not considered a success. SUCCESS After potentially canceling hits with an armor check, if an attack inflicts at least 1 point of damage it is considered a successful attack. This may result in a Dark Legion figure being eliminated, a Doomtrooper losing health, or a hack attempt succeeding. Doomtroopers can withstand multiple hits. For each point of damage taken, a Doomtrooper loses 1 health. The Corporation player moves that Doomtrooper’s health peg on their player board down 1 space. If the health peg reaches the skull icon on their health track, the Doomtrooper is eliminated and removed from the board. Dark Legion figures do not track health like Doomtroopers. If a Dark Legion figure suffers at least 1 point of damage, it is eliminated and removed from the board. The Doomtrooper players earn promotion points for eliminating Dark Legion figures (See Promotion Points). TERRAIN Certain terrain tokens (such as terminals, turrets, traps, and dark portals) in a sector tile may be targeted with an Attack action. Terrain defense values are indicated on the Dark Legion reference board, with possible exceptions on the mission brief. If an Attack action against terrain rolls more hits than the terrain defense value, then the terrain tokens are removed from the sector tile and any promotion points awarded as appropriate. Debris tokens cannot be targeted with an Attack action. FRIENDLY FIRE A Doomtrooper team receives a reckless maneuver token for each point of damage inflicted against another Doomtrooper (even their own). This counts as -3 promotion points to the Doomtrooper at the end of the mission unless stated otherwise in the mission briefing. If no reckless maneuver tokens remain keep track with pen and paper. Close combat attacks represent direct face-to-face combat with melee weapons, close quarter equipment, or natural weapons like deadly claws or teeth. To initiate a close combat attack, the attacker selects an enemy figure in an adjacent square. The targeted enemy can be adjacent orthogonally or diagonally, but cannot be behind terrain or a wall. CLOSE COMBAT SPECIALISTS Note: Overrun and charge are tactics specifically available only to Close Combat Specialist characters. Firearm and Tech Specialists who are able to make close combat attacks cannot benefit from overrun or charge. CLOSE COMBAT ATTACK The Dark Legion player earns promotion points for injuring and eliminating Doomtroopers. (See Promotion Points) Once per attack action, based on their rank, Mishima Doomtroopers may re-roll a number of unsuccessful combat dice from a close combat attack. OVERRUN After a Close Combat Specialist eliminates a Dark Legion unit, they may perform an overrun for free. Performing an overrun allows the Close Combat Specialist to immediately advance into the square vacated by the eliminated unit. This is not considered a Move action. CHARGE After a Close Combat Specialist ends a Move action adjacent to an enemy figure, they may perform a charge attack for their next action in this round. A charge attack allows a Close Combat Specialist to use one additional white combat die while performing a close combat attack against the adjacent enemy figure. The Move action and charge attack must occur in the same turn. Mishima troops force a breach. RULE BOOK 17\n\nFirearm attacks represent long distance combat using weapons ranging from standard plasma carbines to the deadly Nimrod Autocannon. Doomtroopers may not make firearm attacks against adjacent Dark Legion creatures, but while adjacent they may still perform a firearm attack against another non-adjacent Dark Legion creatures. Remember, a Doomtrooper that starts a Move action adjacent to one or more Dark Legion figures is blocked and may only move 2 squares. Firearm attacks require mobility and careful planning for maximum effect. RANGE & LINE OF SIGHT To attack with a firearm, the target figure must be in range and the attacking figure must be able to see the target. Firearm attacks have varying ranges, see the relevant equipment cards for details. A weapon’s minimum range is indicated by a red number, maximum range by black. Specific weapons may vary. See their equipment cards for details. Checking if the attacker can see their target is called determining line of sight. Line of sight is established by drawing an imaginary straight line from the exact center of the square occupied by the attacker to the exact center of the square occupied by the target. If the imaginary line does not go through a wall or any part of a square occupied by another figure, there is a clear line of sight and a firearm attack is possible. Establishing line of sight has some special situations requiring clarification. Line of sight is not blocked if it goes through the point of two diagonal squares with figures in them. This happens when the shot is along a diagonal line of squares. Line of sight is also not blocked when it goes through the point of two diagonal squares with one figure and a wall or an empty square and a wall / figure. Some terrain or special conditions may affect line of sight, as well. See the terrain descriptions or mission brief for details. FIREARM ATTACK Once per attack action, based on their rank, Bauhaus Doomtroopers may re-roll a number of unsuccessful combat dice from a firearm attack. LINE OF SIGHT EXAMPLES These creatures cannot be targetted by Coral Beach (orange outline) because they are behind a wall. These creatures cannot be targetted by Coral Beach (orange outline) because they are adjacent to the attacking Doom Trooper. These creatures cannot be targetted by Coral Beach (orange outline) because they are considered behind other figures. LINE OF SIGHT ON THE STAIRS The map sector with the stairs is a key strategic point in the Citadel. The stairs impact line of sight, based on the following guidelines. - Figures in squares 1 or 2 only have line of sight to the top of the stairs, square 5 and 6, but not beyond. - Figures in squares 3 or 4 only have line of sight to squares 1, 2, 5 and 6. Figures on squares 3 or 4 cannot use firearm attacks. - Figures at the top of the stairs in squares 5 or 6, have line of sight down the stairs to squares 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not beyond and also have line of sight to any squares on the top level of the sector. COVER During some missions, terminal tokens, defense turret tokens, equipment container tokens, and debris tokens may be added to sector tiles to indicate terrain that provides cover. Doomtrooper and Dark Legion figures automatically gain cover if a firearm attack against them draws its line of sight through the marker providing cover. Figures considered to be in cover from an attack increase their defense value by 1, making it harder to hit them. Some missions or terrain may have unique rules regarding cover. This creature can be shot at by Coral Beach (orange outline) without penalty, as the line of sight is not obstructed by the debris squares. These creatures can be shot at by Coral Beach (orange outline), but as the line of sight passes through the debris squares the creatures get a bonus white defense dice. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 18\n\nFIREARM SPECIALIST Note: Concentrated Fire is a tactic specifically available only to Firearm Specialist characters. Close Combat and Tech Specialists who are able to make firearm attacks cannot benefit from concentrated fire. Doomtrooper engineers spend countless hours studying the workings of the Citadel and can use their tech to hack into the very fabric of the Citadel TECH WEAPON ATTACKS Doomtrooper Tech Specialists have access to hacking weapons that can attack Dark Legion creatures. Many of these hacking weapons have special restrictions or guidelines to describe their use, such as being adjacent to a wall. Some Tech Specialist weapons leave trap tokens on the board. See the corresponding equipment card for more details TECH SPECIALIST Note: Door hacks, terminal hacks, and concentrated tech attacks are a tactic specifically available only to Tech Specialist characters. Close Combat and Firearm Specialists who are able to make tech attacks cannot benefit from these special actions. TECH ATTACK TECH ATTACKS AND LINE OF SIGHT Many tech weapons can target figures more than one square from the attacker, but are not considered firearm attacks. Because they are not firearm attacks, the attacking figure does not need line of sight to the target figure. For example: a Tentacle Tech Attack may target a Dark Legion figure 2-3 squares away from the attacking Doomtrooper (purple outline) by opening up a trap beneath their target, but this requires the Doomtrooper to be adjacent to a wall section. If the attack is successful, a tentacle trap marker remains on the map. Once per attack action, based on their rank, Cybertronic Doomtroopers may reroll a number of unsuccessful combat dice from a tech attack. A Nepharite of Algeroth in combat. CONCENTRATED FIRE After a Firearms Specialist makes a firearm attack, they may choose to immediately attack the same figure with their next firearm attack to perform concentrated fire. When performing concentrated fire, for the rest of that player’s turn, their Firearms Specialist gains one additional white combat die, for free. This bonus is cumulative. For example, if a Firearms Specialist performs concentrated fire for a second time during their turn (by using a bonus action gained by discarding a Doomtrooper card) they gain two additional white combat dice. DOOR HACKS Tech Specialists automatically disable door traps as they move through them using a Move action, preventing the need to draw a door card. TERMINAL HACKS Tech Specialists are able to use an Attack action to hack into a terminal if they are standing adjacent to the terminal and they have line of sight to the terminal. The difficulty of the terminal hack is detailed on the Dark Legion reference board for the mission. The mission briefing will explain the result of a successful terminal hack. CONCENTRATED TECH ATTACKS After a Tech Specialist makes a tech attack, they may choose to immediately attack the same figure with their next tech attack to perform a concentrated tech attack. When performing a concentrated tech attack, for the rest of that player’s turn, their Tech Specialist gains one additional white combat die, for free. This bonus is cumulative. For example, if a Tech Specialist performs a concentrated tech attack for a second time during their turn (by using a bonus action gained by discarding a Doomtrooper card) they gain two additional white combat dice. RULE BOOK 19\n\nThe Dark Legion player moves and attacks with the creatures of the Citadel much like the Corporation players do with their Doomtroopers. However, the Dark Legion player must complete the following five steps during their turn. STEP 1. DRAW AND RESOLVE THE TOP EVENT CARD. Read the top event card out loud and follow its instructions. Event cards regulate the number of turns in the mission. Drawing the last event card from the event card deck signals the last round of the mission. Sometimes the event card will detail which Dark Legion reinforcements to place, otherwise draw one force card for each Corporation player to indicate the Dark Legion reinforcements. If the draw pile is exhausted, shuffle and create a new draw pile. Note: If the Dark Legion player is the last player to go during the round with the last event card, the Corporation players do not get any more turns – they need to plan accordingly! STEP 2. PLACE INITIAL REINFORCEMENTS. When adding Dark Legion reinforcements, the Dark Legion player places them off the board, outside sector entrances marked with a red entrance token or as otherwise stated. Different reinforcement figures may enter through different Dark Legion entrances. If any reinforcement figures indicated by the force cards are not available, the Dark Legion player places as many of those figures as possible. If there are no figures of the correct type available, the Dark Legion player does not place any reinforcements. STEP 3. REVEAL A FACE-DOWN FORCE CARD. The Dark Legion player must reveal one face-down force card on a sector tile, if any remain. The figures listed are placed in any square in the sector not adjacent to a Doomtrooper. Note: These figures are placed on the sector tile instead of at red entrance tokens off the map like the reinforcements placed during Step 2. Later in a mission, once more of the map has been explored, there may no longer be any face-down force cards. When there are no more face-down force cards, this step is skipped. If any figures indicated by the face-down force card are not available, the Dark Legion player places as many of those figures as possible. If there are no figures of the correct type available, the Dark Legion player does not place any figures. Figures placed after revealing a face-down force card can be activated during Step 4. STEP 4. ACTIVATE THE DARK LEGION FORCES. On the Dark Legion player’s turn, each Dark Legion figure may perform a number of actions as shown on the Dark Legion reference board. For most creatures, this is 2 actions. Some powerful creatures like the Ezoghoul and the Nepharite may perform up to 3 actions per turn. Dark Legion figures may move and / or attack in any order and even repeat the same action during the turn. A Dark Legion figure must complete all of its actions before another Dark Legion figure is activated. STEP 5. DISCARD THE EVENT CARD. This is done at the end of the Dark Legion player’s turn so the card acts as a reminder for any game effects it may have. THE DARK LEGION PLAYER’S TURN SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 20\n\nDOOMTROOPER ARMOR CHECKS Doomtroopers wear sturdy armor that helps absorb some of the damage they would otherwise suffer. This is represented by their defense value and defense die. When attacked, Doomtroopers subtract their defense value from the number of hits rolled. If there are any hits remaining, they may attempt an armor check by rolling their defense die. On a hit icon, one additional point of damage is canceled. It is possible for a successful armor check to prevent the Doomtrooper from taking any damage from an otherwise successful attack. Even if the armor check succeeds, any excess damage is still applied and the Doomtrooper loses one health for each point of damage suffered. TYPES OF ATTACKS Dark Legion creatures make one of two types of attacks: close combat or firearm. Dark Legion creatures do not perform tech attacks. - CLOSE COMBAT ATTACK: The target of the close combat attack must be in a square adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to the attacking figure and not hidden by terrain or a wall. - FIREARM ATTACK: A Dark Legion figure cannot make a firearm attack against an adjacent Doomtrooper figures, but while adjacent they may still perform a firearm attack against another non-adjacent Doomtrooper. - SPECIAL ATTACKS: Some Dark Legion creatures may have special attacks listed in the mission brief, which explains their use. Dark Legion figures can engage a Doomtrooper using their firearms combat dice or their close combat dice as indicated by the Dark Legion reference board. Firearm attacks by Dark Legion have a range of 16 squares, unless stated otherwise on a weapon or event card. Dark Legion figures need to have Line of Sight to their target for a firearm attack, and cannot make firearm attacks against adjacent Doomtroopers, but while adjacent they may still perform a firearm attack against another non-adjacent Doomtroopers. Dark Legion figures can only make one type of attack (firearm or close combat) during an Attack action. Unless otherwise stated by an equipment or event card, only one enemy figure can be targeted by each attack. A figure cannot perform an Attack action while it is off the map. ATTACK SEQUENCE DETERMINE COMBAT DICE When a Dark Legion figure attacks, the color and number of combat dice used are listed on the current Dark Legion rank reference board. (See Dark Legion reference board.) ROLL AND RESOLVE COMBAT DICE Determining a successful attack and inflicted damage work the same way as attacks made by Doomtroopers against Dark Legion figures. The Dark Legion player rolls the combat dice and counts the number of hits rolled. If the number of hits is greater than the target’s defense value, the attack is successful and the targeted Doomtrooper loses one health for each hit above the target’s defense value. DOOMTROOPER DEFENSE VALUE Unless otherwise stated, Doomtroopers have a Defense Value of 1. The forces of the Dark Legion move and attack much like the Corporation Doomtroopers, but with some minor differences. Some powerful and unique creatures can even use special abilities the Doomtroopers do not have access to. Dark Legion figures may move up to three squares per Move action. Movement may be diagonal or orthogonal in any direction. Dark Legion figures may not move through Doomtrooper figures, but they can move through other Dark Legion figures. Dark Legion figures may not end a Move action on the same square as another Dark Legion creature, a Doomtrooper, a trap, a turret, or any other token unless explicitly stated. Doors on the map automatically open when a Dark Legion figure is on an adjacent square without setting off any traps. The doors will close again if no Dark Legion creature remains adjacent. SUCCESS The Dark Legion player receives 1 promotion point for each point of health lost by a Doomtrooper, even if it is subsequently cured. MAP DETAILS Remember, unless explicitly described in a mission brief, details printed on a sector tile (such as boxes, barrels, tubes, statues, chairs, or tables) do not stop or block movement. Squares which are completely obstructed (such as rubble) or completely vacant (such as a pit) cannot be moved onto. In addition, these items do not block line of sight or provide any protection during an attack. MOVE ACTIONS THE DARK LEGION FIGURE ACTIONS ATTACK ACTIONS RULE BOOK 21\n\nPROMOTION POINTS Both the Corporation players and the Dark Legion player track promotion points earned during the mission on their player tray. DOOMTROOPER PROMOTION POINT AWARDS A Doomtrooper team immediately receives promotion points for each Dark Legion creature eliminated. For example, at Rank 1-2 this is as follows: (See the relevant Dark Legion reference board) DARK LEGION PROMOTION POINT AWARDS The Dark Legion player immediately receives 1 promotion point for each point of health lost by a Doomtrooper, even if that health is subsequently recovered. The Dark Legion player immediately receives an additional 2 bonus promotion points if a Doomtrooper loses their last point of health and is eliminated from the mission. These points are awarded regardless of how the Doomtrooper was defeated – even if it was due to friendly fire by a Corporation player! CREATURE PROMOTION POINTS LEGIONNAIRE 1 NECROMUTANT 2 CENTURION 3 RAZIDE 4 PRAETORIAN STALKER 5 NEPHARITE 6 EZOGHOUL 8 ADVANCING A RANK DURING MISSIONS It is possible to go up a rank during a mission. If a player goes above ‘9’ on the promotion point tracker on the player tray, they replace the rank card on their player board with the next rank card in sequence. A player immediately benefits from their new rank’s combat dice values and defense die. Since credits and the number of Doomtrooper cards a player starts with is determined before the mission, changes to these values are not reflected during a mission. Promotion points above and beyond what was necessary to increase in rank carry over into the new rank. (See Rank Cards.) If a Doomtrooper team is reduced to rank 1 and no promotion points, ignore any further deductions. With Coral Beach and his Cybertronic troopers shooting up a large Dark Legion contingent to their rear, Angelina Drake and Sandra Tang hustled towards the medivactrack with a wounded comrade slung across each of their shoulders. “He ain’t heavy,” Drake half-hummed, half-sang. “He’s my brother.” “That hick,” Tang replied. “Is too idiotic to be your brother. You wouldn’t get clipped like that.” “It wasn’t my fault,” groaned the trooper on Drake’s shoulders. “That’s what everyone says. You should dump him, Drake.” “My, my. You are touchy, Major,” shouted Drake over the noise of a huge explosion from behind them. Peripheral debris showered the area and pattered from their armor, drawing more groans from the wounded. ”You have to pick the men in your life carefully, Drake. Otherwise you end up having to carry them everywhere.” “That why you picked the biggest guy in the pile?” “No. Just being pragmatic. Next time, I might need to be the biggest meat sack in the pile. Besides, I like this guy. He has the sense to shut up and be grateful. And the grace not to bleed all over me.” “You’re a true romantic.” SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 22\n\nEach mission takes several rounds to complete. Unless the mission brief states otherwise, the final round of the mission occurs when the last Dark Legion event card is drawn. If this occurs before all Corporation players have had a turn, the rest of the round is resolved normally. Once the final identification marker has been drawn, that player completes their turn, then the mission is over. To determine the winner of a single mission game, the players must determine their total earned promotion points based on their performance during the mission and any additional promotion points awarded or lost after the mission is completed. DOOMTROOPER - Tracked In-Game Promotion Points - Primary Mission Bonuses or Penalties (as Commander) - Secondary Mission Bonuses or Penalties - Secondary Mission Bonuses or Penalties (as Commander) --3 Promotion Points for each Reckless Maneuver Token DARK LEGION - Tracked In-Game Promotion Points - Primary Mission Bonuses or Penalties POST-MISSION AWARDS Promotion points are tracked cumulatively both during and after each mission. Make sure to add any post-mission rewards to the total number of promotion points already earned during the mission. POST-MISSION PENALTIES Corporation players subtract 3 Promotion Points for each reckless maneuver token they received during the mission. (See Friendly Fire.) Award Primary Mission Points. Collectively, the Corporation players determine if the primary mission was successfully completed based on the goals outlined in the mission brief. If the primary mission was successful, each Corporation player gains the number of promotion points listed in the mission brief. If the primary mission was not successfully completed, refer to the mission brief to see if the Dark Legion player earns any additional promotion points. Award Secondary Mission Points. Individually, the Corporation players determine if they successfully completed their secondary missions (if present). Each secondary mission has its own rewards for achieving its goals and may list penalties if the mission failed. In some case, the Dark Legion player may earn promotion points for failed secondary missions. DECLARING A WINNER After adjusting their in-mission promotion point total based on the success or failure of any primary or secondary mission requirements, the player with the most promotion points is declared the Victor! In the case of a tie between the Dark Legion player and one or more Corporation players, the Dark Legion player wins the mission. If one or more Corporation players are tied, those players share a joint win. A campaign is made up of a number of individual missions played in sequence. In a campaign, as the players play and complete missions, their Doomtroopers advance in rank, become more proficient in combat, and earn the credits needed to access the most powerful weapons and equipment available. The total number of missions in a campaign should be determined prior to starting the first mission. Five missions are recommended for a short campaign. Ten missions are recommended for a longer, extended campaign. Another option is to choose a number of missions equal to the number of players participating in the campaign so everyone has an opportunity to play as the Dark Legion player. Note: When playing a campaign, players may choose to begin at Rank 2 or higher. However, for the true Siege of the Citadel experience, it is recommended to start the campaign at Rank 1 – seeing the Corporation teams advance and grow is part of what makes playing a campaign so rewarding. COMPLETING A MISSION SINGLE MISSION VICTORY CAMPAIGN VICTORY Imperial forces ambushing a Nepharite. RULE BOOK 23\n\nNote: When choosing to play at a higher rank, all players-- including the Dark Legion player--start at the same rank with the same number of starting promotion points. IN-MISSION ACHIEVEMENTS Corporation players mark promotion points earned for eliminating Dark Legion creatures and for other objectives detailed in the mission brief, while the Dark Legion player earns promotion points for injuring and eliminating Doomtroopers, just as they would during a single mission game. Since progress is tracked cumulatively over the course of a campaign, the most significant difference with tracking inmission achievements between a single mission game and a campaign game is that the individual players may be starting out a mission at different ranks and promotion point totals. POST-MISSION AWARDS Like a single mission game, during a campaign mission, promotion points are tracked cumulatively both during and after each mission. Make sure to add any post-mission rewards to the total number of promotion points already earned during the mission. Award Primary Mission Points. Collectively, the Corporation players determine if the primary mission was successfully completed based on the goals outlined in the mission brief. If the primary mission was successful, each Corporation player gains the number of promotion points listed in the mission brief. If the primary mission was not successfully completed, refer to the mission brief to see if the Dark Legion player earns any additional promotion points. Award Secondary Mission Points. Individually, the Corporation players determine if they successfully completed their secondary missions (if present). Each secondary mission has its own rewards for achieving its goals and may list penalties if the mission failed. RECKLESS MANEUVER Corporation players receive 3 promotion point penalties for every reckless maneuver token acquired during the mission. DECLARING A WINNER After each mission in a campaign, players announce their current rank and promotion point total, but a final winner is not declared until after the last mission of the campaign. After the rewards and penalties for the final mission are tallied, the player, with the highest rank and total number of promotion points, is declared the winner of the campaign. If one or more Corporation players are tied, those players share a joint win. Regardless of the actual winner, the biggest victory is the shared experience and fun players have while playing through the campaign! COMMANDER TOKEN The Doomtrooper player with the commander token has a greater responsibility to ensure the mission is successful, so if the mission is failed, they are demoted one rank. (This is the equivalent of a 10 promotion point penalty.) They must take the rank card one lower than their current rank card and place it on their player tray instead, removing the previous rank card. In future mission, this may affect their combat dice and other rank dependant benefits. They do not alter the position of their promotion point tracking peg. As Sean Gallagher ran his sword through the first Necromutant, the next one in line shoved its kin along the runic-encrusted blade. Suddenly unbalanced, Gallagher fell backwards, connected hard with the earth, and lost his grip on his sword. The world went black for a moment. Murdoch and Duval were yelling from far away. It suddenly seemed like everybody cared for him. Thoughts of the sunrise over New Bristol skittered across his consciousness… bagpipes playing Hinterlands… that he was the last of his clan. The crushing weight of the Necromutants piled atop him brought Gallagher round. One of them was snapping its teeth inches from his face. “I WILL TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF!!!” it roared as iron claws gripped Gallagher’s throat and squeezed. “Not if I take yours first,” choked Gallagher as his hand grasped his sword hilt. The awkward thrust into the Necromutant’s throat caused its head to came away in his hand, it’s startled rictus frozen in pain. He staggered to his feet still clutching it. Duval looked more disgusted than impressed. Sean shrugged. Seems like he’d have to figure out some other way to impress her. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 24\n\nThe rank card on a player tray shows a variety of information that dictates the power, abilites, and choices the Doomtrooper teams have before and during missions. RANK CARDS CORPORATION RANK Corporation Doomtrooper teams typically start at rank 1 and can progress as far as rank 12 during a campaign as they gain experience and are awarded Promotion points. Which Equipment cards a Doomtrooper team can select is determined by this rank. The Doomtrooper teams’ rank also dictate the Dark Legion player’s rank used in the mission (See Dark Legion reference board.). DOOMTROOPER CARDS The number shows the number of Doomtrooper cards the Doomtrooper team are dealt at the start of each mission. These cards represent special abilities or tactics the teams can use during missions. (See Doomtrooper Cards.) COMBAT DICE As a Doomtrooper team increases in rank, their combat dice become better, leading to more successes. White combat dice are the weakest, red combat dice are stronger, and black combat dice are the most powerful dice Doomtroopers can use. (See Attack Actions.). DOOMTROOPER DEFENSE DICE This shows the color of dice (white, red, or black) a Doomtrooper can roll when attacked to cancel points of damage. (See Armor Checks.) CREDITS The number of credits each team has allocated to them at the start of each mission to “Checkout” items from the Equipment Bunker. Credits indicate the maximum total value of equipment cards a team can check out for a particular mission. Some equipment can only be checked out of the Equipment Bunker when a team achieves a certain rank. Any remaining credits are lost and new credits are allocated at the start of the next mission. (See Equipment Bunker, pg. 22.) CORPORATION SPECIAL ABILITY Each Corporation Doomtrooper team has a special ability that distinguishes its team members from the other Corporations. (See Corporation rank cards.) When a Corporation player increases in rank during a mission, the amount of Doomtrooper cards and credits only changes at the start of the next mission. The Ezoghoul appeared from nowhere. Twice as high as a man and fifty steps away. “Damn,” cursed Bob Watts. It launched itself at him, eerily silent in its charge. “Double damn.” He raised the Deathlockdrum. Yelled. “Damn, die!” The gun’s da-da-da-da-da-da didn’t bother Bob. “Damn-damn-damn-damn-damn!” he cussed. The impacts walked up the Ehzoghoul’s body. It didn’t even miss a step. Twenty steps away. Headshot! “Die, damn you!” Fifteen steps away. It finally staggered! “Damned die!” Ten steps away. Still rolling like a Martian freight train. “Damned!” Five steps away. Click. Click. Click “Dang!” Doomtroopers cannot progress beyond rank 12. For scoring purposes, at rank 12 add a Corporation token to the rank card each time you progress beyond 9 promotion points and reset to zero as usual. RULE BOOK 25\n\nMANUS KIT The Manus Kit encases a detached necromutant’s forearm, which it uses to access the Citadel’s defenses. It works like a Tentacle Kit, and in addition barbed spores attack all figures in accessible squares adjacent to the trap (including Doomtrooper figures). Roll one combat die of the player’s choice once for each square. Barb combat dice may not be re-rolled. SPECIAL WEAPONS The Doomtroopers have access to a broad array of weapons, many of which have special features and abilities beyond the combat dice provided during combat. TENTACLE KIT The Tentacle Kit taps into the defenses of the Citadel. To attack with the Tentacle Kit, the Doomtrooper must be adjacent to a wall of the Citadel. This tech attack can target a Dark Legion figure 2-3 squares away and does not require line of sight. The Doomtrooper player rolls combat dice against the Dark Legion figure’s defense value as usual. If successful, the Dark Legion figure is eliminated and a trap token is placed on the vacant square. Later, any Doomtrooper or Dark Legion figure passing through this square is attacked according to the Dark Legion reference board. A tech specialist may only maintain two traps on the board at the same time. If a third trap is to be placed, one of the previous traps must first be removed from the board. A Doomtrooper or Dark Legion figure may not end their Move action on a square with a trap token. The Tentacle Kit also provides a blade for a small close combat attack. EQUIPMENT BUNKER Collectively, the deck of equipment cards is referred to as the Equipment Bunker. The equipment bunker is the Corporation warehouse for all types of advanced equipment and powerful weapons. Each equipment card in the bunker represents one weapon, a weapon combo, or one piece of equipment. Some equipment can only be checked out of the equipment bunker when a team achieves a certain rank level. WEAPON CARDS Weapon cards have a brief description of the weapon, the number of close combat, firearm or tech combat dice used, attack range, cost in credits, and rank requirement to checkout from the equipment bunker. A Doomtrooper can only have one weapon card. DOOMTROOPER SPECIALITIES Each Doomtrooper has a specialty in Close Combat (red), Firearms (cyan), or Tech (gold) as determined by the icon on their character card. The weapon they equip must share the same icon on its weapon card or the Doomtrooper cannot equip the item. Example: Valerie Duval is a close combat specialist and can only be armed with a close combat weapon or a weapon combo that features a close combat weapon. WEAPON RANK REQUIRED CREDIT COST TENTACLE KIT 1 0 PUNISHER SHORT SWORD 1 0 PLASMA CARBINE 1 0 MANUS KIT 3 2 VIOLATOR SWORD 3 3 DEATHLOCKDRUM 3 3 PUNISHER COMBO 4 2 TENTACLE COMBO 4 2 TALON COMBO 4 3 GEHENNA PUKER 5 2 VIOLATOR COMBO 6 4 MANUS COMBO 6 4 NIMROD AUTOCANNON 8 4 Capitol Doomtroopers start each mission with additional credits, depending on their rank. Additionally they can equip items 1 rank above. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 26\n\nEQUIPMENT CARDS Non-weapon equipment cards have a brief description, which includes the effect of the equipment, and its cost in credits. Each Doomtrooper can carry up to three non-weapon equipment cards into a mission. Some equipment cards augment a weapon. Each weapon card can be augmented by no more than one additional equipment card. EQUIPMENT CARD COSTS TALON COMBO KIT All combo kits may be equipped by multiple types of Doomtrooper Specialists. The Talon Combo Kit may be equipped by a Firearm Specialist or a Tech Specialist and allows either to do an enhanced tech attack or alternatively a firearm attack with a powerful Deathlockdrum. To tech attack a target with a trap the Doomtrooper must be adjacent to a wall of the Citadel and within 2-3 squares of the target. A target of the Deathlockdrum must be in line of sight and in this combo the weapon’s range is reduced. Both attacks use one white die in addition to the player’s combat dice. NIMROD AUTOCANNON The two barrels of the Nimrod Autocannon allow a Doomtrooper to target one or two figures with the same firearm attack between 4 and 12 squares away. The weapon is too unwieldy to use against Dark Legion creatures up to only 3 squares away. The Doomtrooper must have a line of sight to both targeted figures and the targets must be no further than 4 squares apart. If only one figure is targeted, the combat dice are rolled twice against one figure. If two figures are targeted, the combat dice are rolled separately against each. VIOLATOR SWORD A Violator Sword can be used in close combat to either target a single Dark Legion figure or swung in a circle, starting with one target figure adjacent to the attacker, then going clockwise or counter-clockwise around the Doomtrooper. The attack strikes all figures in adjacent squares and only stops if it strikes a wall or has attacked each adjacent figure once. The Doomtrooper rolls 3 combat dice plus the combat die indicated on the weapon card. The number of hits rolled are applied against all figures. All targeted Dark Legion figures with a defense value less than the number of hits rolled are eliminated. Doomtrooper figures hit by the attack can attempt an armor check to negate one point of damage. GEHENNA PUKER The Gehenna Puker firearm attack inflicts hits on all targets in its line of fire, which is a straight line in a diagonal or orthogonal direction. The Gehenna Puker attack always fills its entire range of 7 squares. The Doomtrooper rolls combat dice once to determine the number of hits inflicted against every figure in the line of fire. All targeted Dark Legion figures with a defense value less than the number of hits rolled are eliminated. Doomtrooper figures in the line of fire may attempt an armor check to negate one of the hits.

When used in a firearm attack, the Doomtrooper targets a square within line of sight, up to 8 squares away. The combat dice are rolled once to determine the number of hits applied to any figure in the target square. Figures in squares adjacent to the target square suffer one fewer point of damage. Figures on the other side of a wall are not affected. Dark Legion figures in or adjacent to the target square with a defense value less than the number of hits rolled are eliminated. Doomtroopers may attempt an armor check to negate one point of damage from the attack. May only be equipped to Plasma Carbine. SMOKE GRENADE Take one Special action to throw to the floor in your current sector. The entire sector fills with smoke. All Move actions in the sector are reduced to 2 squares. No firearm attacks are possible. Place a Smoke Grenade token on the sector. The Smoke Grenade token is removed from play at the end of the round. Discard after one use. TIME BOMB Takes one Special action to place the time bomb and set the timer. Place the Time Bomb token in an empty accessible square adjacent to your Doomtrooper. The bomb does not block or impede movement. The bomb explodes in the next round, at the start of the Dark Legion player’s turn. The explosion inflicts a trap attack (according to the Dark Legion reference board) to any figure on the square with the bomb and all figures in adjacent squares not protected by walls. Discard after one use. DISRUPTOR A fearsome underslung weapon mounted to the barrel of appropriate firearms, it alters the target’s atomic structure to inflict severe wounds. During a firearm attack, all targets are prevented from rolling their defense die, if applicable. This cannot be fitted to a Nimrod Autocannon or a Grenade Launcher. The sentience stirred at the heart of the Citadel. Something was nestled inside its very nervous system, an alien presence hidden amongst the tubes and wiring, the nerves and cogs. Like a dream that refused to dissipate despite the fact you were awake. And the Citadel sure was awake. Constantly hammered, hurt, bombed, and burned by its master’s enemies, it was hard to get even a moment’s rest, and now this presence. It was niggling away… right there. Clinging to the nodes and iron-studded brains controlling the Gate of Lost Hope. Such a tiny, tiny thing. “Little thing,” the Citadel hissed. “Who are you?” “Me?” the little thing replied. “I am nobody.” “Do you not have a name?” “No.” “That reminds me of the tale where a human tells a Nepharite his name is ‘nobody’ and then the human picks out the Nepharite’s eye and the Nepharite screams ‘nobody plucked out my eye’ and… I KNOW THAT IS A TRICK!!! Everybody has a proper name.” For a while it was quiet in gore-space. Then came: “Ok. I am Carl.” SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 28\n\nThere are three double-sided Dark Legion reference boards. The Dark Legion rank referred to on the reference board depends on the ranks of the Corporation teams going into the mission. In a single mission game, the rank used for the Dark Legion reference board is the same rank as the Corporation players. The rank of the Dark Legion reference board may only increase at the start of a mission and not during a mission. The Dark Legion reference board indicates the current level, defense value, number of actions per turn, and the number of combat dice rolled for close combat and firearm attacks. It also lists the number of promotion points earned by Corporation players for each Dark Legion figure eliminated or terrain piece destroyed by their Doomtroopers. DARK LEGION REFERENCE BOARD DARK LEGION RANK IN SINGLE MISSION GAMES In a single mission game, the rank used for the Dark Legion reference board is the same rank as the Corporation players. The rank of the Dark Legion reference board may only increase at the start of a mission and not during a mission. IN CAMPAIGN MISSIONS In a campaign mission, the rank of the Dark Legion reference board is the same rank as the secondhighest ranked Corporation team participating in the mission. (If only one Doomtrooper team remains or teams are tied for highest rank and promotion points, their ranks determine the rank of the Dark Legion reference board.) The rank of the Corporation played by the Dark Legion player is not taken into account. This means it is possible that the Dark Legion forces may be several ranks higher or lower than the Corporation run by the current mission’s Dark Legion player. At the start of a campaign, the Dark Legion player uses the Rank 1-2 reference board. Then, when at least two Corporations reach the next highest rank, the Dark Legion player uses the reference board with the same rank as those two Corporations. After the first mission, when at least two Corporations reach rank 3 or higher, the Dark Legion player uses the rank 3-4 reference board. When at least two Corporations reach rank 5 or higher, the Dark Legion player uses the rank 5-6 reference board. This progression continues until at least two Corporations reach rank 11 and the Dark Legion player uses the rank 11-12 reference board. CLOSE COMBAT The number of and colors of the combat dice the Dark Legion creature rolls when making close combat attacks. FIREARM COMBAT The number of and colors of the combat dice the Dark Legion creature rolls when making firearm attacks. DEFENSE VALUE The number a Doomtrooper’s hits needs to exceed in order to eliminate the Dark Legion creature. PROMOTION POINTS The number of Promotion Points awarded to a Doomtrooper for eliminating the Dark Legion creature. DEFENSE DIE The color of die a Dark Legion creature can roll to soak up damage from a Doomtrooper’s attack. ACTIONS The number of actions the Dark Legion creature can take during its activation. RULE BOOK 29\n\nSECONDARY MISSION REWARDS At the end of the mission, if a secondary mission is successfully completed, that Corporation player’s team receives the number of promotion points and any other rewards indicated on the secondary mission card. When a secondary mission fails, the Corporation player loses promotion points as indicated on the card. A Corporation player who lost both Doomtroopers during the mission still receives the awards (or penalties) based on whether or not they completed their secondary missions. REWARDS This section indicates the promotion point rewards a Corporation gains when the primary mission is successfully completed and the promotion point rewards the Dark Legion player gains if the Corporation players fail to complete their primary mission. When the primary mission is accomplished, all Corporation players with at least one surviving Doomtrooper receive the same number of promotion points. A Corporation player who lost both Doomtroopers during the mission receives no primary mission rewards, but they do retain all promotion points earned by their Doomtrooper team during the mission. SECONDARY MISSION CARDS Most primary missions feature secondary missions unique to each Corporation player. Unless stated differently in the mission brief, each Corporation player draws two secondary mission cards during mission setup. They choose one of the secondary mission cards to keep and return the other card to the secondary mission card deck. All Corporation players should try to accomplish both the primary mission and their own secondary mission to receive the maximum rewards possible. Whether or not the primary mission is accomplished, each Corporation player determines any secondary mission rewards individually. COMPLETING SECONDARY MISSIONS Secondary missions are secret and only revealed when the goal listed on the card is accomplished. A player must be able to prove the completion of their secondary missions or their secondary mission is a failure. Normally after a Dark Legion enemy is eliminated, the figure is returned to the Dark Legion player’s pool of figures. Some secondary missions, however, require a player to place eliminated figures on the secondary mission card. In these cases the figures are returned to the Dark Legion player’s creature figure pool after the secondary mission is completed and has been revealed. PRIMARY MISSION STRUCTURE MISSION MAP The Primary Mission features a diagram for the setup of the mission’s map. The diagram clearly indicates: - Which sector boards to use. - The orientation and placement of the sector boards. When building the map, make sure the double-sided sector map has the correct side face up. - Doomtrooper sector entrance points are marked with white entrance tokens. - Dark Legion reinforcement sector entrance points are marked with red entrance tokens. - The location of any closed doors. If there are any closed doors, place a door marker in the corresponding space on the indicated sector. HIGH COMMAND BRIEF This section presents background information and describes how the mission impacts its campaign storyline. MISSION BRIEF This section details the task that the Corporation Doomtrooper teams must accomplish. TIME LIMIT This section indicates which of the numbered event cards are used to create the event card deck for the mission. The event cards act as the mission timer, with one event card drawn by the Dark Legion player at the start of their turn. When the last event card is drawn, the round is completed and the mission ends. DARK LEGION RESOURCES This section lists which numbered force cards are used in the mission and how the Dark Legion player deploys these cards. MISSIONS COMMANDER Since the player with the commander token held a higher rank at the start of the mission, their risks are greater if they fail to complete their secondary mission. Note: If a mission commander fails their secondary mission card, they can still receive promotion points for a successful primary mission. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 30\n\nEach Doomtrooper card can be used for one of two purposes: it may be discarded to perform an extra action with a Doomtrooper figure or played for its text effect. A player may only use one Doomtrooper card on their turn, regardless of how it is used. Some Doomtrooper cards can be played for their text effect during another player’s turn. These do not count against a player’s card limit on their own turn. When a player uses a Doomtrooper card, its effect must be resolved before the player may use another Doomtrooper card. Players should not reveal their Doomtrooper cards until used. Once a Doomtrooper card is used and its effect is resolved, the card is discarded. Doomtrooper cards cannot be saved from mission to mission. DOOMTROOPER CARDS AI / SOLO & COOPERATIVE RULES COMPASS SYSTEM On each AI card a pair of compass results are displayed, which indicate a primary and secondary direction, such as East-North on the card example. This system is used to locate specific elements on the game board. It refers to a compass made up of four directions: North, East, South, and West. Each compass has a primary gold dial (pointing at the primary direction) and a secondary silver dial (pointing at the secondary direction). For example, if the AI Dark Legion player is required to choose between several Doomtroopers and pinpoint one specific Doomtrooper, the players reveal the top AI card: 1. Refer to the primary direction (for example, East) and look for the easternmost Doomtrooper that you can find on the board. 2. If there’s more than one Doomtrooper that could be selected, refer to the secondary direction, (for example, North) and find the northernmost Doomtrooper of this eastern Doomtrooper selection. 3. This Doomtrooper is the selected target. This technique can be used to select sector tiles within the game board, as well as objects, Dark Legion units, etc. In the Siege of the Citadel board game, players may choose to band together with their Corporations and use the AI cards to control the forces of the Dark Legion. If playing solo, it is advisable that you control two Corporations instead of just one. The AI cards can replicate the decisions that a human Dark Legion player is required to make by the game. All you need to do is reveal the top card from the AI card deck and follow the instructions. If for some reason you don’t know how to proceed, use your best judgement. Place the Compass token to indicate the direction of North for this mission. RULE BOOK 31\n\nCORPORATION TARGET ICON If you are required to Target a Corporation, or decide a tiebreak between two different corporations the result is determined by this icon. THE MATRIX This element of the AI card is used solely to select a specific square within a sector tile. This is referenced via co-ordinates on the grid below. ACTION SELECTION To determine the action that a Dark Legion figure takes next, reveal the top AI card and follow the instructions in priority order. First of all, follow the first instruction; if the conditions are not appropriate then follow the second instruction; if these conditions are not appropriate, follow the third instruction (if present). Reveal a new AI card for each new Dark Legion figure action. EXAMPLE DECISIONS AN AI CARD CAN MAKE: - Which Dark Legion figure takes their actions first? Use the compass system to identify the Dark Legion figure. - Where to place new reinforcements? Use the compass system to identify the Dark Legion entrance token. - Which Corporation is affected by the event card? The Corporation indicated by the Corporation icon present on the AI card. DARK LEGION TURN In Solo & Coop mode, the Dark Legion turns follows the usual steps, with the following alterations: every time a decision that would normally be enacted by a Dark Legion player is required, reveal the top card of the AI deck, follow the instructions, then place it in the discard pile. STEP 1: DRAW AN EVENT CARD AND RESOLVE AS USUAL. If the event card requires a decision, reveal the top card from the AI deck and follow the instructions: If you are required to Target a Doomtrooper, Target a Dark Legion Unit, Target a Tile, or Target an Entrance use the compass system to determine the result. If you are required to Target a Square use the matrix. If you are required to Target a Corporation the result is determined by the Corporation icon on the AI card. STEP 2: PLACE INITIAL REINFORCEMENTS AS USUAL. To determine where the reinforcements enter the game board, use the compass system to identify Dark Legion entrance tokens. STEP 3: REVEAL A FACE-DOWN FORCE CARD. Identify the sector tile that is nearest to the Doomtroopers (including any they are currently on) and still contains force cards. Use the compass system if necessary to identify the tile. Reveal the top force card there and place any Dark Legion reinforcements using the matrix. Normal placement rules apply. If any rules are breached, reveal another AI card until all the rules are followed. STEP 4: ACTIVATE THE DARK LEGION FORCES. Reveal the top AI card and place it apart. This Tie Breaker card will determine the order of activation for the Dark Legion forces using the compass system. For each Dark Legion creature action, reveal another AI card to determine their actions. When executing an attack, the target Doomtrooper is always the nearest one to the attacking unit. If two or more Doomtroopers are eligible targets, use the Tie Breaker AI card and the compass system. STEP 5: RETURN ALL AI CARDS TO THE AI CARD DECK AND SHUFFLE THOROUGHLY. Note: On occasion, when the Dark Legion player would be required to make a decision on a Corporation player’s turn, reveal the top AI card to determine the result. For example, if a Doomtrooper enters a sector tile, Dark Legion figures may spawn on the tile. Use the matrix to determine their position on the tile. Remember Dark Legion forces may not be placed adjacent to a Doomtrooper. If this rule is breached, reveal another AI card until all the rules are followed. SIEGE OF THE CITADEL 32\n\nHIGH COMMAND BRIEFING Intelligence reports indicate that the forces of the Dark Legion are amassing for another attack. It is imperative that the battle plans for Alakhai’s next assault are located before the plans are finalized. MISSION The Doomtroopers must enter the Citadel, make their way to the War Room, photograph Alakhai’s battle plans, and then upload the plans to High Command. Before the end of the mission, a Doomtrooper must occupy a square adjacent to one of the desks [D] in sector tile 12 and for one action, photograph the plans and upload them. All Doomtroopers carry a photography device. - Doomtrooper entrance points in sector tiles 14 & 15 are marked with white entrance tokens. - Secondary mission cards are not used. - TIME LIMIT: 5 Rounds EVENTS The Dark Legion player shuffles event cards numbered 1–12 and draws 5 cards. The rest of the event cards are set aside and are not used in the mission. Reinforcements on the event cards enter the Citadel at entrance points in sector tiles 14 & 15. DARK LEGION RESOURCES The Dark Legion player removes force cards numbered 33–36 and sets them aside. They are not used in this mission. The remaining force cards are shuffled. For each Doomtrooper team, place one force card facedown on each game board sector tile. The remaining force cards form a draw pile and are placed in front of the Dark Legion player. REWARDS - COMPLETE MISSION: Doomtrooper Teams receive 4 promotion points. - FAILURE: Dark Legion player receives 4 promotion points. A Doomtrooper team with the commander token deducts 2 additional promotion points.
