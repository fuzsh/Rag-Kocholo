        "text": "Background – Operation Weserübung – The German Invasion of Norway and Denmark\n\nThe loss of Glorious, Ardent and Acasta is one of the closing events in the Allies campaign against Operation Weserübung, Germany’s successful invasion and subsequent occupation of Denmark and Norway during the Second World War.\n\nTo understand the context of why Glorious was present in Norweigian waters and the events surrounding her loss, it is important to first understand the factors that contributed to the invasion of Norway and the subsequent ill-fated campaign that was mounted by the Allies against the German forces.\n\nA brief, high-level overview covering the invasion of Norway is included below. This account is not intended to be all-encompassing and there are a number of events both on and off the battlefield that are not covered in this summarized account.\n\nOrigins of Operation Weserübung\n\nIn the early morning of 9 April 1940 (Wesertag, “Weser Day”), Germany occupied Denmark and invaded Norway, ostensibly as a preventive maneuver against a planned, and openly discussed, Franco-British occupation of Norway known as Plan R 4 (actually developed as a response to any German aggression against Norway).\n\nAfter the occupation of Denmark (the Danish military was ordered to stand down as Denmark did not declare war with Germany), envoys of the Germans informed the governments of Denmark and Norway that the Wehrmacht had come to protect the countries’ neutrality against Franco-British aggression.\n\nFrom the spring of 1939, the British Admiralty had come to regard Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea as a potential theatre of war in any future conflict with Germany, and by this time such a conflict had come to be seen as all but inevitable. The British government was extremely reluctant to engage in another land conflict on the continent of Europe, the consensus being that any such war would be a repeat of World War I’s Western Front with its strategic stalemate and significant casualties. Thus, the British started to consider a blockade strategy which would materially weaken the German forces and the war-making industries on which they relied.\n\nAt this time German heavy industry was largely reliant on the import of iron ore from the northern Swedish mining district, centered on Kiruna and Malmberget. While some of this ore was shipped from the Swedish port of Luleå , some 90% of it was transported by rail from Sweden to Norway, where it was loaded onto ships in Narvik, an ice-free port and therefore usable during the winter when Luleå and the Baltic Sea were frozen. The British therefore came to believe that interdiction of Norway’s coast could cut the flow of iron ore to Germany, and also serve to tighten a general naval blockade of Germany by preventing any of its shipping from using Norwegian coastal waters.\n\nIn October 1939 the commander-in-chief of the German navy, Grossadmiral Erich Raeder, discussed with Adolf Hitler the danger he perceived by the establishment of British bases in Norway, and thus the desirability of Germany seizing these bases before the British tried to do so. Raeder further argued that German possession of Norway would give the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) control of the nearby seas and provide Germany with advanced bases for future operations against the United Kingdom. The other branches of the German armed forces showed no interest in Scandinavia at this time. However, on the 9th October 1939 Hitler issued the Führerweisung Nr 6, stating that the main German effort would be a land offensive against France via the Low Countries.\n\nToward the end of November, Winston Churchill, the new First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed the mining of Norwegian coastal waters. This would force the German ships transporting iron ore to travel through the open waters of the North Sea, where it would be easier for the Royal Navy to intercept, destroy or capture them. Churchill’s proposal was rejected by the current prime minister and foreign secretary, Neville Chamberlain, and Lord Halifax, on the grounds that it might cause an adverse reaction among other neutral nations.\n\nAfter the start of the Soviet-Finnish ‘Talvisota’ winter war in November 1939, the diplomatic situation changed, and Churchill once again proposed his mining scheme but was again refused. In December, the UK and France began to lay serious plans for the delivery of material and manpower Finland on the rationale that Finland was fighting a country which was, at the time, a German ally. The Allied plan called for a force to be landed at Narvik in northern Norway, and then to advance across Sweden into Finland. This plan would also open the way for Allied forces to occupy the Swedish iron ore mining region. The plan now received the support of Chamberlain and Halifax, who were counting on Norwegian cooperation. However, both Norway and Sweden let it be known that any Anglo-French involvement in Scandinavian affairs would not be tolerated. Planning for the operation continued, but the justification for the expeditionary force ended when Finland sued for an armistice with the USSR in March 1940.\n\nPreliminary plans for the invasion of Norway\n\nBy now firmly convinced of the threat posed by the Allies to the iron ore supply on which Germany was so reliant, Hitler ordered the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht to begin preliminary planning for an invasion of Norway.\n\nThe preliminary plan was named ‘Studie Nord’ (Study North) and called for the use of only one German army division. Between the 14 and 19of January 1940 the German Navy developed an expanded version of this plan and concluded that two factors were essential. The first was the use of operational as well as tactical surprise to reduce the threat of Norwegian resistance and British intervention, and the second the use of German warships rather than comparatively slow merchant ships to transport the invasion forces and thus permit the simultaneous descent on all of the several target areas.\n\nThis new plan called for the army to provide a full corps of one mountain division, two infantry divisions and one motorized infantry brigade; the Luftwaffe was also to contribute one airborne division. The target objectives of the German forces were Oslo (the Norwegian capital and primary population center), Bergen, Finnmark, Narvik, Stavanger, Tromsø and Trondheim. The plan also called for the swift capture of King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway in the hopes that this would trigger a rapid surrender.\n\nOn 21 February 1940, command of the operation’s land element was entrusted to the German General, General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, an Arctic warfare specialist.\n\nThe final plan was ‘Weserübung’, which was completed on 27 January 1940. The operation would be under the command of Falkenhorst’s own XXI Corps (redesignated as Gruppe XXI on 1 March 1940) and was to include Generalmajor Eduard Dietl’s 3rd Gebirgsdivision and five infantry divisions, none of the latter having yet been tested in battle.\n\nThe initial echelon would consist of three divisions for the assault, with another three to follow in the next wave, and three companies of paratroopers would also be used to seize the airfields which were an essential element of the operation.\n\nIn its first form the plan was based solely on an invasion of Norway, which was the primary objective, with control of Denmark’s airfields gained by diplomatic means. However, Hitler issued a new directive, Führerweisung Nr 10a, on March 1st 1940, and this mandated the invasion of Denmark in addition to Norway. This change reflected the Luftwaffe’s insistence on the need for secure fighter bases and sites for air warning stations in Denmark. Generalleutnant Leonhard Kaupisch’s Höheres Kommando zbV XXXI was formed for the invasion of Denmark, this formation comprising Generalmajor Walter Wittke’s 170th Division, Generalmajor Otto Röttig’s 198th Division and Oberst Günther Angern’s 11th Schützenbrigade (motorized.).\n\nThe entire operation would be supported by Generaloberst Erhard Milch’s Luftflotte V in the form of Generalleutnant Hans Geisler’s X Fliegerkorps, which fielded 290 level bombers, 40 dive-bombers, 100 twin- and single-engined fighters, 70 reconnaissance aircraft and, perhaps most important of all, some 500 Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft for supply and the delivery of the small airborne forces involved in the operation.\n\nThe navy contributed virtually all of its available surface fleet, and these warships were supplemented by some 41 transport vessels for the delivery of additional troops, weapons and fuel. Naval command was to be exercised by Generaladmiral Alfred Saalwächter, heading the Marinegruppenkommando West.\n\nThe Altmark Incident\n\nThe situation started to come to a head on the 16th February 1940, when the British destroyer, HMS Cossack intercepted and boarded the German supply vessel Altmark in Norwegian waters. The Altmark had sought to return to Germany after serving as a support vessel for the raiding cruise of the pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee. This Royal Navy’s actions violated Norwegian neutrality but freed 300 captive British sailors, themselves held in violation of Norwegian neutrality and international law, which mandated that all prisoners of war be released as soon as their captors’ vessel entered neutral waters.\n\nHitler viewed the Altmark incident as irrefutable proof of the UK Government’s willingness to violate Norwegian neutrality, and so became even more committed to the invasion plan.\n\nOn 12 March 1940 , just as the ‘Talvisota’ was coming to its end, the British finally decided to send an expeditionary force to Norway. The expeditionary force began boarding on the 13 March, but was recalled and the operation cancelled with the end of the ‘Talvisota’ on the same day. Instead the British cabinet voted to proceed with the Operation Wilfred, the mining of Norwegian coastal waters, followed by troop landings.\n\nCommencement of Operation Weserübung – The Invasion of Denmark\n\nThe first ‘Weserübung’ ships departed Germany on the 3 April 1940, on the 8th April a British destroyer began laying the first mines in Norwegian waters, and on 9 April the German invasion started.\n\nIn overall strategic terms, Denmark was relatively unimportant to Germany and needed only as a staging area for the ‘Weserübung’ operations in Norway. Small and relatively flat, Denmark is ideal terrain for the type of fast-moving operations and tactics which the Germans preferred and excelled at.\n\nDenmark’s small army, under the command of General William Wain Prior and centred on Generalmajor Hans Aage Rolsted’s 1st ‘Seeland’ Division based in Copenhagen and eastern Denmark, and Generalmajor Frederick Christian Essemann’s 2nd ‘Jutland’ Division based in the Jutland peninsula, had little hope of success in armed resistance to ‘Weserübung’. Nevertheless, in the early morning hours some Danish regiments engaged the invading German army, suffering a few dozen dead. After 1,000 German infantry landed in the harbour of Copenhagen, the Danish capital, a detachment of troops from the Royal Life Guard Regiment engaged them. Just as the Royal Guard were repulsing the attacking Germans, several formations of Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17 bombers roared over the city. Faced with the explicit threat of the Luftwaffe bombing the civilian population, Christian X capitulated almost instantly in exchange for the German promise of Danish political independence in domestic matters.\n\nThe invasion of Norway\n\nThe surrender of Denmark left the Germans free to concentrate their efforts on the invasion of Norway, which Germany now wanted not just to safeguard the continuance of iron ore shipments from Sweden via Narvik, but also for the suitability of its long northern coast as a base area for naval units, and most especially U-boats, from which to harry Allied commercial shipping in the North Atlantic.\n\nIt had been clear from the start that the best way to undertake the northern part of ‘Weserübung’ was to take key points round Norway’s long coast with forces landed from the sea, supported in key areas by airborne troops who would land to secure airfields and other strategic targets, and then rush in reinforcements to deal with Norwegian opposition before it could be rallied under effective leadership. The primary threat to the German plans was the Royal Navy, who had an overwhelming material superiority over the Kreigsmarine and threatened the destruction of the assault forces before they even reached Norway.\n\nThe invasion of Norway was based on five primary groups, each tasked with the capture of a specific bridgehead through which reinforcements could be rushed. The overall concept ‘Weserübung’ was divided into the three-part ‘Weserübung Süd’ to take Oslo, Kristiansand and Bergen in the ‘Oldenburg’, ‘Karlshafen’ and ‘Bremen’ sub-operations, and the two-part ‘Weserübung Nord’ to take Trondheim and Narvik in the ‘Wildente’ and ‘Naumburg’ sub-operations.\n\nSupporting ‘Weserübung Nord’, were the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, under the command of Vizeadmiral Günther Lütjens, providing distant cover for Gruppe I (destroyers Georg Thiele, Wilhelm Heidkamp, Hans Lüdemann, Hermann Künne, Diether von Roeder, Anton Schmitt, Wolfgang Zenker, Bernd von Arnim, Erich Giese and Erich Koellner) under the command of Kapitän Friedrich Bonte and delivering 2,000 men of the 139th Gebirgsjägerregiment under Dietl to Narvik; and Gruppe II (heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper and destroyers Paul Jacobi, Bruno Heinemann, Theodor Riedel and Friedrich Eckoldt) under the command of Kapitän Hellmuth Heye and conveying 1,700 men of the 138th Gebirgsjägerregiment to Trondheim.\n\nIn ‘Weserübung Süd’, Gruppe III (light cruisers Köln and Königsberg, gunnery training ship Bremse, transport Karl Peters, three torpedo boats and five S-boote) under the command of Konteradmiral Hubert Schmundt carried 1,900 men of the 69th Division to Bergen; Gruppe IV (light cruiser Karlsruhe, three torpedo boats and seven S-boote) under the command of Kapitän Friedrich Rieve ferried 1,100 men of the 163rd Division’s 310th Regiment to Kristiansand; Gruppe V (heavy cruiser Blücher, pocket battleship Lützow, light cruiser Emden, three torpedo boats and eight minesweepers) under the command of Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz transported 2,000 men of the 163rd Division to Oslo; and four minesweepers under the command of Korvettenkapitän Kurt Thoma moved 150 troops to Egersund.\n\nLate in the evening of 8 April, the ships of Gruppe V were spotted by the Norwegian guard vessel Pol III, which was engaged and subsequently destroyed. However, Blücher was sunk in the Oslofjord later that day by an elderly 11-in (280-mm) gun installed at Oscarsborg fortress in May 1893, and by equally obsolete torpedoes: during the early morning of 9 April, the gunners of the Oscarsborg fortress fired on Blücher, which has been illuminated by coastal searchlights and was leading the German formation up the fjord. Within two hours the Blücher, unable to manoeuvre in the tight confines of the fjord, had sunk with more than six hundred sailors and soldiers killed.\n\nThe Allies had been able to warn the two Scandinavian governments of the impending threat, but neither Denmark nor Norway had moved with haste to improve their defence positions, Denmark because she could do little and Norway because she was unwilling to be seen undertaking military preparations.\n\nThe Germans issued a surrender ultimatum to each country just before the start of operations, and Denmark’s capitulation allowed the Höheres Kommando zbV XXXI to complete its tasks without difficulty. However, Norway’s government rejected the German demands, and the landings went ahead as planned as the Norwegian forces mobilised under the command of Colonel Otto Ruge, who was immediately promoted to general on his appointment to replace the unfit commander-in-chief.\n\nAt Narvik the 3rd Gebirgsdivision’s force was faced by Generalmajor Carl Gustav Fleischer’s 6th Division, but secured its objectives easily as the Norwegian formation was not mobilised and the town was surrendered by a Norweigian Colonel sympathetic to the Germans.\n\nAt Trondheim the opposition was led by Generalmajor Jacob Ager Laurantzon’s 5th Division, but again the Germans secured their objectives without difficulty.\n\nSome resistance was offered at Bergen even before the Germans had landed the light cruiser Königsberg was crippled by the Norwegian shore batteries and was later sunk by Fleet Air Arm aircraft operating from bases in the Orkney Islands.\n\nAt Kristiansand and Arendal Generalmajor Einar Liljedahl’s 3rd Division was soon in retreat before the German forces, whose landings had been upset by the torpedoing of Karlsruhe by the British submarine Truant\n\nThe Germans assaulting Oslo were nearly repulsed even before they got ashore to face Generalmajor Carl Johan Erichsen’s 1st Division and Generalmajor Jacob Hvinden Haug’s 2nd Division. The assault force was heavily shelled by the Norwegian coastal batteries, which sank Blücher, as noted above, while shore-launched torpedoes also severely damaged Lützow, which had to turn back to Germany. Even so, Engelbrecht managed to get part of his 163rd Division ashore and then to take half of Oslo and the arsenal at Horten. The German position was stabilised by the arrival of airlifted reinforcements at Fornebu airfield.\n\nThe German threat to Norway was dangerous but was initially focussed in localised pockets and could have been contained by rapid and concerted action on the part of the Allies. No such action was forthcoming, though the Home Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Forbes tried its best. The battle-cruiser Renown was already in the area with four destroyers, escorting the minelaying forces of ‘Operation Wilfred’, and Forbes immediately put to sea with the maximum number of vessels he could raise, which consisted of two battleships, one battle-cruiser, four cruisers and 21 destroyers. But this response was ill considered, especially as the cruisers, currently lying at Rosyth to embark troops for Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger, were now ordered to offload the troops and depart in support of the Home Fleet, and the elderly fleet carrier Furious was rushed to sea so rapidly she had no time to embark her fighter aircraft.\n\nThe British were more concerned with intercepting the German battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which were operating as a detached squadron in the North Sea as a decoy for British naval countermeasures, and other German naval units than in delivering troops to mainland Norway. Yet it was troops that were required to contain the scattered German effort.\n\nOnce the Germans had secured a foothold in Norway they were able to rush reinforcements into the openings and then begin to sortie out into the countryside with the objective to consolidate and link their forces. It was only during the period of April 14th to 19th that the Allies finally began to land troops in Norway.\n\nThe Allied effort was centered on the capture of Narvik and of Trondheim, but it appeared to the allies that little could be achieved against the growing German strength. Despite this outlook, the Royal Navy won some significant victories during the first and second battles of Narvik sinking ten German destroyers and a number of support vessels.\n\nThe German situation in Northern Norway was actually quite precarious. At the outset,the position of General Deitl in Northern Norway was not good: his 2,000 troops defending Narvik against a counter attack were outnumbered. After the German destroyers had been sunk, 2,600 German sailors joined in the land battle. Another 290 German specialists travelled via Sweden posing as health care workers. During the last three to four weeks, the Germans were also reinforced by about 1,000 men air dropped over Bjørnfjell, thus bringing the total number of Germans to around 5,600. Their position and outlook changed from good to dire several times.\n\nThe Allies advance on Narvik with the French and Norweigian forces closing in from the north and the Polish from the South. The German commander decided to evacuate and retired his forces to Beisfjord. The capture of Narvik was the first major Allied victory on land but the celebrations would be short lived.\n\nIt seemed that it was only a matter of time before the Germans would have to surrender. They were pushed from the north by the Norwegians, from the west by the French and from the southwest by the Poles. It appeared that Bjørnfjell would be the Germans’ last stand, but events elsewhere in Europe came to their rescue.\n\nThe German assault on Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France had reduced the relative importance of Germany’s iron ore provision and of Scandinavia. The UK Government had secretly decided to evacuate Norway on the 24th of May as part of Operation Alphabet (covered in more detail below). On the night of 24/25 May, Lord Cork received orders to retreat, but under cover so the Germans would be prevented from interfering. The Allied commanders agreed that an attack on Narvik would disguise the retreat and allow the destruction of the iron ore harbour.\n\nThe Norwegian government and commanders were first told of the evacuation plans in early June and the news was met with disbelief and bitterness. The Norwegians still hoped to defeat the Germans and as late as 5 June, one of the two Norwegian brigades was ordered to attack the German forces.\n\nIt was in the shadow of this that the recently captured town of Narvik was evacuated on the evening of the 8/9 June. Before leaving Narvik the Allies destroyed the harbor facilities to ensure that shipments of Iron ore from the port to Germany were severely disrupted.\n\nAs the Narvik force was being evacuated the carrier Glorious, returning to the UK with a valuable cargo of aircraft, encountered the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and was sunk, together with her two escorting destroyers. Scharnhorst was badly damaged by a torpedo from one of the escorts, and Gneisenau was similarly damaged a few days later. Both ships were out of action for six months.\n\nThe Germans were now in full control of Norway and the remaining government forces had little option but to surrender on 10 June.\n\nOut of a strength of 120,000 men in nine infantry divisions, one motorized infantry brigade and one artillery battalion, the Germans had lost 5,636 men killed or missing and 341 men wounded, as well as one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, 10 destroyers and a number of U-boats, lighter warships and transport vessels together with a not insignificant number of warplanes. The Allies had fielded 109,500 men (about 60,000 Norwegians in six divisions, about 14,500 Danes in two divisions, and about 35,000 British, French and Poles, and lost 6,132 men killed (1,869 British, 1,335 Norwegians, 530 of the combined Franco-Polish force and 16 Danes).\n\n‘Weserübung Nord’ did not include a military assault on neutral Sweden, and indeed there was no need for any such undertaking: by taking Norway, the Kattegat and Skagerrak separating Denmark and Norway, and most of the shores of the Baltic Sea, Germany had encircled Sweden from the north, west and south, and in the east lay the USSR, successor to the Russia which had for centuries been Sweden and Finland’s arch enemy, and was currently on friendly terms with Germany under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939. Thus the maritime trade of Sweden and Finland was wholly controlled by the Germany navy, and as a result Germany was able to exert pressure on Sweden to permit the transit of military goods and soldiers on leave. On 18 June an agreement was reached for soldiers to travel unarmed and not as part of unit movements. During August 1940, Finland agreed to grant access to her territory for the German forces, initially for the transit of troops and military equipment to and from northernmost Norway, but soon also for the establishment along the transit road of the minor bases which would eventually grow in preparation for ‘Barbarossa’, the invasion of the USSR\n\nBackground – Operation Alphabet, Juno and the loss of the loss of HMS Glorious, Ardent and Acasta\n\nOperation Alphabet is Launched\n\nOperation Alphabet, as detailed above, was the general Allied retreat from Norway. The operation was approved on 24 May 1940.\n\nAmong those who argued against the evacuation of Norway was Winston Churchill, who later expressed that the decision to abandon Norway had been a mistake.\n\nThe Norwegian authorities were only informed of the decision on the 1st June.\n\nAfter a meeting on 7 June 1940, at which the decision to carry on the fight abroad was made, King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav and the Norwegian cabinet left Norway on the British light cruiser Devonshire and went into exile in the United Kingdom.\n\nWithout supplies from the Allies the Norwegian Army would soon have been unable to continue the fight. Both the King and the Crown Prince had considered the possibility of remaining in Norway but had been persuaded by the British diplomat Cecil Dormer to instead follow the government into exile. The Crown Prince suggested that he should remain and assist the Administrative Council in easing the effects of the occupation, but due to the King’s old age it was decided that they both had to go into exile, in order to avoid complications should the King die while abroad.\n\nBy the 8 June, after destroying rail lines and port facilities, all Allied troops had been evacuated.\n\nTwo troop convoys were formed, the first (Group I) sailing on the 7th and the second (Group II), sailing on the 8th. Both convoys reached the UK safely.\n\nDuring the night of June 7th and morning of June 8th, the carriers Ark Royal and Glorious were operating together north of Andenes Point in the Lofoten Islands, supporting the final stages of Operation Alphabet.\n\nOperation Juno\n\nAt the same time as the Allies were launching Operation Alphabet, the Kriegsmarine, oblivious to the allies intentions, launched Operation Juno on the 8 June 1940. Juno was planned as an attack on Harstad to relieve pressure on General Dietel’s garrison in the Narvik area.\n\nThe German ships involved were the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper and the destroyers Z20 Karl Galster, Z10 Hans Lody, Z15 Erich Steinbrinck and Z7 Hermann Schoemann.\n\nJuly 7th/8th – Glorious makes aviation history\n\nWith the initiation of Operation Alphabet the RAF Pilots of 46 Squadron, operating at Bardufoss Airbase, approximately 80km North of Narvik, were warned that they would have to evacuate Norway that evening.\n\nAll military and critical hardware that couldn’t be transported back to the UK and which could facilitate the enemy’s war effort was to be irreparably damaged. This equipment included 46 Squadron’s Hurricanes, which had been shipped to Norway and didn’t have sufficient range to return to the UK.\n\nThe Commanding Officer (CO) of 46 Squadron, Squadron Leader K B Cross, believed that with the evacuation of Allied forces from France a few days earlier and the abandonment of Norway, the RAF would need as many fighters as possible.\n\nCross asked the pilots of 46 Squadron for volunteers who were willing to fly their aircraft on to Glorious, a feat that had never been achieved before. All the pilots in the squadron volunteered even though it was clear that landing a high-performance Hurricane without the aid of an arrestor hook onto a carrier was fraught with danger.\n\nFlight Commander Jameson came up with the idea of placing a 7-kilogram (15 lb) sandbag inside the tail to give the aircraft extra weight and reduce the landing run while allowing the aircraft’s breaks to be applied immediately on landing. A quick test was carried out at Bardufoss and proved a success.\n\nTen Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of June 7th.\n\nAt 14:30 on the 7 June, Glorious flew off four Swordfish aircraft to Bardufoss who would guide the RAF Hurricanes back to Glorious.\n\nAt 18.00 Flight Lieutenant Jameson, Flight Lieutenant Knight, and Sgt Taylor took off and were over HMS Glorious at just after 19:00. Glorious had been worked up to full speed speed in preparation for the Hurricanes and was steaming at approximately 29-30kts\n\nSgt. Taylor became the first pilot to land a Hurricane on a carrier followed by Jameson and Knight. All three aircraft landed perfectly and used only three quarters of the flight deck, each aircraft was quickly stowed in the hangar before the next aircraft landed.\n\nReports of the success were radioed back to the unit ashore although it was reported that this message was never received. A Swordfish was dispatched to Bardufoss with orders to land the remainder of the RAF aircraft.\n\nAt this time the remaining fighters of 46 Squadron were busy with their final combat patrols. F/O Mee and P/O Drummond had engaged 4 He 111’s over Narvik, each pilot claiming to have shot down one enemy aircraft. P/O Drummond attacked and damaged the other two.\n\nAfter careful consideration, Cross selected six of the squadron’s most senior pilots to fly with him to Glorious. The remaining severn Hurricanes departed Bardufoss Airfield with a Swordfish guide for the last time at 00:45. A few hours later the runway at Bardufoss would be rendered unusable by the detonation of over 120 charges, ensuring that considerable work was needed to restore the airbase to operational status.\n\nAt 01:15 Glorious began to land the Hurricanes and by 02:25 all aircraft had been landed safely onboard Glorious\n\nIt was a remarkable achievement and 46 Squadron had shown that a Hurricane could be landed on a carrier.\n\nAbove: HMS Glorious ferrying Hurricane’s to Norway\n\n02:53 – Glorious Departs Narvik\n\nThe initial evacuation plans had called for the carriers HMS Ark Royal and Glorious to form part of the escort of the Group II convoy.\n\nHowever, in the early hours of the 8th, Glorious made a signal to Vice Admiral Aircraft Carriers (VAA) in Ark Royal, asking permission for Glorious and her escorts proceed independently to Scapa Flow\n\nThe existence and content of this signal is also controversial. In a testimonial submitted in 1968, some 28 years after the event, Commander Le Geyt of the destroyer Diana noted a signalling lamp onboard Glorious flashing Ark Royal at around 02:25 (03:53). The Leading Signalman onboard Diana read the message which was a request from Glorious “for permission to part company and proceed ahead to Scapa Flow for the purpose of making preparations for impending courts-martial”\n\nThis signal, if factual and accurately recalled, probably refers to the serious rift that had grown between Glorious’ captain, D’Oyly-Hughes, and his senior flying officers. This relationship had come to a head when Commander Flying, J. B. Heath, being put ashore to face a court martial.\n\nThe request to proceed was approved and at 02:53 (02:53) on the 8th June, Glorious, Ardent and Acasta parted company with Ark Royal , thereafter, proceeding on a reported course of 250° at 22 knots.\n\nDuring mid-morning the group reduced speed to 17 knots and, in an attempt to confuse enemy submarines, commenced zigzagging.\n\nOperation Juno Evolves\n\nDuring the 7th of June 1940 the German ships of operation Juno replenished fuel from the fleet tanker Dithmarschen near Jan Mayen.\n\nAdmiral Marschall took this opportunity to convene a meeting of his officers and to discuss the attack on Harstad. Among the officers in attendance was Rear-Admiral Otto Backenhohler (Marshall’s chief-of-staff), Rear-Admiral Hubert Schmundt (Commander of the reconnaissance force), Captain Harold Netzbandt (Commanding Officer Gneisenau ), Captain Kurt Caesar Hoffman (Commanding Officer Scharnhorst), Captain Helmuth Heye (Commanding Officer Hipper), Captain Erich Bay (Commander, destroyers).\n\nIt was a mighty assembly of German Navy elite. The mood among these officers was very strongly against the operation against Hardstad and the risks associated with an attack in the narrow confines of the fjord.\n\nHowever, events were changing. Intelligence received late that evening suggested to Admiral Marschall that the Allies were at sea and steaming west. Intelligence from Navy Group West, obtained from a shadowing U-Boat indicated that three groups of ships were spotted off the coast. Initially it was assumed these were reinforcements until a follow-up message indicated that these ships were heading away from the Norweigian Coast. A later overflight of Harstad by Luftwaffe aircraft identified a single gunboat.\n\nMarshall noted in his war diary at 23:30 on June 7th 1940 – “leads me to suspect that surprising westward movement may mean that the British are evacuating Norway”\n\nWith this trickle of information, Marschall decided to position his ships across the known convoy routes back to the UK. Marschall’s intentions were simple, intercept and destroy any allied shipping, especially troop ships or carriers returning to the UK. It would be a decision that would later see Marschall replaced as Flottenchef\n\nBetween 06:00 and 13:00 on the morning of June 8th, the troop transport Orama (19,000 tons), the tanker Oil Pioneer (5600 tons) and the minesweeping trawler HMT Juniper (544 tonnes) all fell to Marschall’s guns\n\nAbove: Hans Lody rescuing survivors from the troop transport Orama\n\nAt 13:18 (12:18) on the 8 June, Admiral Marschall under the false assumption that the allies were now aware of his ships and thus limiting his options to refuel at sea, ordered the Admiral Hipper and the accompanying destroyers to Trondheim, where they arrived in the morning of the 9 June.\n\n13:18 – Admiral Marschall heads to Warn the supply ship Dithmarschen\n\nAfter separating from Hipper and the destroyers, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau began a 90 nautical mile transit to the North-North West to warn the supply ship Dithmarschen, which was stationed in the area , that British vessels were expected to transit through the area.\n\nAt 13:00 (12:00) the German and British vessels were separated by approximately 100 nautical miles with the German ships running perpendicular to Glorious’ route back to Scapa Flow.\n\nA further 40 nautical miles or so beyond and out-of-sight of Glorious was the light cruiser HMS Devonshire running at high speed back to the UK. Devonshire carried a special cargo as part of the top secret mission to convey the King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav, members of the Norwegian Royal Family and Norweigian cabinet to the UK where they could continue the fight against the German’s.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Glorious knew of the proximity of HMS Devonshire’s or its mission, or vice versa.\n\n16:00 – The Readiness of HMS Glorious\n\nBy 16:00 (15:00) Glorious and her escorts had reached a waypoint on their transit and altered course from 250° (WSW) to 205°(SSW) for Scapa Flow (analysed later in this study)\n\nAt this stage of the transit, Glorious was operating in the fourth degree of readiness, i.e. at cruising stations, steaming at 17 knots with only 12 of her 18 boilers “fired up”.\n\nNone of Glorious’ aircraft were ranged on deck, nor were any in the air. A Swordfish Aircraft had been placed at 10 minutes readiness.\n\nSurvivors’ testimonies also indicate that some of the aircraft’s armaments and weapons racks had been removed and stowed in preparation for the arrival of Glorious’ in Scapa Flow.\n\nArdent and Acasta were maintaining a positions two cables (440 meters) on either bow.\n\nNone of the Royal Navy ships were fitted with radar and the carrier did not have any lookouts manning the crow’s nest located on Glorious’ main mast above the bridge\n\nHowever, Board of Inquiry testimonials indicate that lookouts were placed on the Bridge Decks and the fourth condition of readiness would have prescribed surface and horizon lookout coverage.\n\nThe sea was calm, with wind force 2-3 (approximately 6.5-10 knots) from the northwest, sea temperature I°C (34°F), visibility was described as exceptional.\n\nShortly after 17:00 (16:00) two unidentified ships were sighted on the western horizon by Glorious’ lookouts.\n\nOnboard Glorious the Gunners Mate was sent aloft to the crows nest, to identify the distant vessels, an identity challenge was flashed at the approaching ships but neither ship answered and Ardent was ordered to investigate.\n\nAt roughly the same time, approximately 17:05 (16:05), a pipe was made for five Swordfish Torpedo Bombers to be ranged on Glorious’ flight deck.\n\nAround 16:15 (17:15) a message was transmitted by Glorious indicating the presence of 2 German Battleships.\n\nAt approximately 17:20 (16:20) Action Stations were sounded onboard Glorious\n\nThe German’s contact with Glorious had developed approximately 14 minutes earlier at 16:46 (15:46) when an eagle-eyed Midshipman, Siegrfried Goss, onboard the Scharnhorst spotted a small cloud of smoke on the horizon. At that point the German vessels were enroute to warn their supply vessel Dithmarschen with Gneisenau ahead of Scharnhorst and steaming at 19kts on a course of 330\n\nAlerted to the distant smoke, a sighting report was sent from Scharnhorst to Marschall in Gneisenau. The German lookouts attentively scanned the horizon and were soon rewarded as the unmistakable shape of a battle mast and large funnel slowly resolved itself.\n\nAs Marschall received reports of the battle mast from the lookouts he knew he was dealing with a sizable target although the German’s initially assumed that their quarry was a battleship.\n\nThe German ships began to raise steam for full speed and shortly after altered course to close in on the enemy ships.\n\nThe element of surprise was squarely with Marschall’s ships and it would be another 14 minutes until the British lookouts spotted the approaching German vessels. During this period Marschall positioned his ships windward of their adversaries.\n\nTactically, this was a judicious move by Marschall. Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were now windward of the British carrier. During WWII it was often necessary for an aircraft carrier to turn into the wind to maximize airspeed over the flight deck and provide assistance to its aircraft both for take off and landing.\n\nBy positioning Gneisenau and Scharnhorst windward of his quarry, Marschall would force a retreating carrier to run with the wind, depriving its aircraft of valuable airspeed.\n\nAt 17:14 (16:14) confirmation that the target was an aircraft carrier was confirmed by Scharnhorst’s gunnery officer who misidentified the carrier as Ark Royal. A few moments later the smaller masts of two escorts were identified.\n\nGlorious was now steaming with the wind blowing along her flight deck from an astern position, effectively canceling out some, if not all of the airspeed generated by the ship’s movement through the water.\n\nIn order to generate the maximum airspeed across the flight deck, Glorious would have to turn into the wind and steam directly at the advancing German ship’s.\n\nWhile the reduced airspeed across Glorious’ decks may not have prevented the launch of the Swordfish Torpedo bombers; it certainly would have introduced additional variables to the launch and recovery operations.\n\nAt 17:02 (16:02), as the British were being alerted to the distant vessels the German ships were sounding “Action Stations” and subsequently preparing their ship’s for battle. It would be a full 18 minutes before action stations were sounded onboard Glorious. Gneisenau and Scharnhorst were now prepared for battle.\n\nIn accordance with instructions from Glorious, Ardent closed on the unidentified vessels flashing a challenge on her searchlight effectively demanding that the ships identify themselves. The German’s did not respond to Ardent’s challenge or even attempt to offer a fake name as they had done earlier that day when challenged by Juniper.\n\nA few moments later Scharnhorst and Gneisenau responded to Ardent’s challenge with gunfire\n\n17:27 – The Battle Opens\n\nThe battle now opened with Gneisenau ’s secondary armaments engaging Ardent at a range of approximately 16,000 yards (14,600 meters) at 17:27 (16:27) , followed at 17:30 (16:30) by Scharnhorst’s secondary armaments.\n\nAbove: Scharnhorst opening fire on Glorious with her forward turrets “Anton and “Bruno”\n\nAs the German ships opened fire, the Gunners Mate onboard Glorious, who had gone aloft to identify the unknown ships, reported back that the ships were German and consisted of one Hipper-class cruiser and a smaller 6” cruiser\n\nUnder fire, Ardent withdrew to the South-South-East, firing torpedoes, one of which was seen to pass close ahead of Scharnhorst. Both the British destroyers began to generate defensive smokescreens with their smoke generators and smoke floats. Glorious began to increase her speed to distance herself from the approaching German ships.\n\nAt roughly the same time, Glorious altered course to 169° at 17:25 (16:25) before resuming a course of 205° at 17:29 (16:29)\n\nBy 17:36 (16:36) Gneisenau was making 30.5 knots while Scharnhorst, experiencing boiler trouble, was making 29kts.\n\nScharnhorst, initially occupying the lead position, opened fire on Glorious at 17:32 (16:32) with her forward two turrets, ‘Anton’ and ‘Bruno’ at a range of 28,600 yards (26,150 meters). Gneisenau followed suit and opened fire at 17:46 (16:46). Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau ’s secondary armaments continued to engage Ardent\n\nAbove: Gneisenau moving across Scharnhorst’s wake from port to starboard side. This image would have been taken around 17:40.\n\nMarschall wanted his “big guns” to focus on disabling the greatest threat to his ships, primarily Glorious’ flight deck and its aircraft, two of which were being readied on deck\n\n17:38 – The longest hit\n\nScharnhorst and Gneisenau were equipped with an 81.5cm (368MHz) FuMO 22 Radar situated in an additional tower above the forward rangefinder tower. The 2m x 6m mattress antenna on the front of the tower rotated with the 10.5m rangefinders so the result from both instruments could be compared\n\nConsidering the distances and vessel speed, Scharnhorst’s ranging to Glorious was nothing short of exceptional. The first salvo fell short, the second salvo long and the third, at 17:38 (16:38) hit its target.\n\nAbove: Scharnhorst in action during operation Juno\n\nFor many of Glorious’ crew the shell splashes were the first indication that their ship was under attack and some of the crew mistakenly assumed that these splashes were the result of an air attack.\n\nGlorious received her first hit from Scharnhorst’s third salvo at around 17:38 (16:38), in Marschall’s words the hit tore up large sections of the flightdeck “like the lid of a box”\n\nThe shell that hit Glorious would have completed the 12.9 nautical mile (24km) journey in little under 45 seconds, hitting with an impact angle of approximately 25 degrees and at a speed of 450m/sec or roughly 1000mph.\n\nAvailable data indicates that at the time of this first hit Glorious was approximately 12.9-13 nautical miles (24-24.2km) from Scharnhorst. This distance would make Scharnhorst the record holder for the longest confirmed hit by a battleship on another ship during WWII, comparable to HMS Warspite’s hit on the Italian flagship Guilio Cesare at 13 nautical mile (24km) . This shot will be analysed in much greater detail later in this study. The hit on Glorious’ is even more exceptional given the fact that Scahrnhorst was traveling at 29kts and hitting a target that is estimated to be traveling between 26 and 30kts.\n\nOn impact with Glorious, the 283mm shell penetrated the flightdeck and burst inside the upper hangar starting a large fire which wrecked the RAF Hurricanes and the other aircraft currently stored in the hangar.\n\nSplinters from the explosion pierced a boiler casing and smoke entered the air intakes. This caused a temporary drop in steam pressure from two boilers, but pressure was built up again as the smoke cleared.\n\nAbove: Gneisenau firing her guns at Glorious (taken from Scharnhorst)\n\nThe two Swordfish Torpedo Bombers that were being prepared on the flight deck were destroyed and blown overboard by the force of the explosion.\n\nWhile the damage to the flight deck may still have permitted flying off operations, the two aircraft on deck had been lost and the hangar had been turned into an inferno, destroying the aircraft stored within and limiting the offensive capability of the ship.\n\n1758 – 1820, Hunters in pursuit\n\nDue to Scharnhorst’s engine defect, Gneisenau’s slightly superior speed allowed her to slowly overhaul the Scharnhorst during the action, until she had put her twin some 22 cables (4,850 meters) on her port quarter.\n\nThe two ships maintained these relative positions until near the end of the engagement, when Gneisenau reduced speed.\n\nSince the initial sighting of the unknown ships, Glorious had been running a roughly a South to South-Westerly course, at 17:47 (16:47) she altered course and maintained a South-Easterly course, placing the German vessels directly astern of her, with Scharnhorst on the port-quarter and Gneisenau on the starboard-quarter\n\nThough in vain, this movement is prudent in many ways. Firstly it placed the enemy directly astern of Glorious and reduced her visible profile to the German rangefinders. Alone this action is only a minor inconvenience for her pursuers as the German ships would also be using their FuMO Radars for ranging in parallel to their optical rangefinders. However, the destroyer generated smokescreens would have been more effective with the wind blowing from astern onto the ship being masked. The direction of the wind would now help increase the effectiveness of the smoke screen and shield Glorious’ movements from her pursuers. Combining the reduced profile and the effectiveness of the smokescreen worked and both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst were unable to pinpoint Glorious for almost twenty minutes (17:58-18:20.)\n\nArdent proved a tenacious adversary for the German ships and effectively deployed a smokescreen to screen Glorious and her own movements from the pursuers\n\nAt 17:56 (16:56), just before the Germans were forced to cease fire due to the screening smoke, a hit on the homing beacon wrecked Glorious’ bridge, killing the captain and the majority of the bridge personnel.\n\nWith the death of the Captain D’Oyly-Hughes the Executive Officer, Commander Lovell assumed command of Glorious from the Lower Conning Tower.\n\n18:00 – Ardent’s Last Stand\n\nSince the initial engagement, Ardent had made a number of torpedo runs against the German ship’s, emerging from her own smokescreen to launch a spread of torpedoes before retreating back into the smoke.\n\nAbove: HMS Ardent (H41)\n\nArdent’s skillful handling and screening of Glorious drew praise from her German adversaries who more than once were forced to take evasive maneuvers to avoid her torpedoes. In his report Marschall wrote:\n\n“The destroyer on the port side of the battleship force again attacked with torpedoes, and endeavoured in an extremely skillful manner to escape the effective defensive fire of the medium guns of the battleships by constant alterations of course. Finally this destroyer also opened fire on the battleships. She fought with a dash which was outstanding in a hopeless situation. The destroyer received numerous hits and finally went down, steaming at high speed with her engines apparently undamaged and firing her forward to the last. The last fighting range was about 5 miles.”\n\nArdent made a single hit on Scharnhorst with her 4.7-inch guns, but was extensively hit by return fire from the 5.9-inch secondary armament of the battleships.\n\nAt 18:04 (17:04) the lookouts onboard Scharnhorst observed a hit on Ardent and she began to develop a list and lose speed. Despite these wounds, a minute later she fired a spread of torpedoes and the German ships were once again forced to take evasive action.\n\nAt 18:11 (17:11) the crippled Ardent was taken under fire by both Scharnhorst’s secondary armament and the ship’s heavy Flak Anti-Aircraft guns.\n\nAt 18:18 (17:18) with Ardent now unable to maintain the smokescreen, Glorious was spotted at ‘great distance’ from Scharnhorst burning fiercely on the stern. Glorious’ was again taken under fire by Scharnhorst’s main armament\n\nBy 18:22 (17:22) the battle was over for Ardent, her mast was knocked down by a shell and she rolled over and capsized, a few minutes later.\n\nAt 18:25 (17:25) Marschall in Gneisenau sent a congratulatory message to the crew of Scharnhorst for sinking the destroyer.\n\n18:30 – Glorious’ Final Moments\n\nWith Ardent disposed of, the German ships penetrated the dispersing smokescreen that Ardent had been providing and again focussed their main armaments on Glorious, scoring additional hits:\n\n“Glorious was again sighted at great range. The heavy guns opened fire from the bow and very quickly the aircraft carrier received further hits. The fighting range quickly narrowed”\n\nThe first announcement to abandon ship was issued to Glorious’ crew around 18:10 (17:10). This order was deferred shortly after when Commander Lovell assumed command and the situation looked improved due to the effective smokescreen laid by the destroyers..\n\nHowever, at 18:20 (17:20) a hit in the center engine room shook the whole ship and thereafter Glorious began to lose speed, develop a starboard list, and commence a slow circle to port.\n\nThis slow turn would have presented Glorious to the full onslaught of the German’s guns as the pursuers closed the distance\n\nOnboard Glorious the situation was deteriorating rapidly as the German ships landed hit after hit on the stricken carrier.\n\nThe second and final announcement to abandon ship came around 18:40 (17:40). By this time Glorious was a raging inferno, listing 15-20 degrees to starboard and “dead in the water”.\n\nAt roughly the same time as the second abandon ship order was issued the Germans ceased fire and Glorious capsized and sank at about 19:10 (18:10)\n\nAbove: Glorious listing and aflame. This image was most likely taken around 17:39 (16:39) when Scharnhorst and Gneisenau passed by the stricken carrier at a distance of roughly 9,000 yards\n\nAbove: One of the burning ships, most likely Glorious at around 17:39 (16:39)\n\n18:35 – Acasta and Nick Carter\n\nMeanwhile Acasta was steaming away from the German ships with her crew wondering if the plan of action was to attack or retreat. Around this time Commander Glasfurd addressed his crew over Acasta’s tannoy system:\n\n“You may think we are running away from the enemy. But the Navy never does. The Glorious is sinking, and our chummy ship, the Ardent, has sunk. The least we can do is make a show. Good luck to you all. May God be with you”.\n\nShortly after this broadcast Acasta prepared for a torpedo run on the German ships.\n\nExiting the safety of her own smoke screen she caught the German ships unaware and managed to fire a spread of four torpedoes in the direction of Scharnhorst before retreating back into the safety of her smokescreen.\n\nThe crew of Acasta were certain that they had scored a hit with one of their torpedoes as a flash of light was observed on the port bow of the enemy ship. Command Glasfurd made an announcement via the ship’s tannoy congratulating the crew on their successful attack.\n\nHowever, the flash observed from Acasta was not caused by a torpedo detonation and was probably the result of a single hit from Acasta’s 4.7” guns which had scored a hit on the forwarded gun of Scharnhorst. The hit was a glancing blow and did not cause any significant damage or limit Scharnhorst’s battle readiness.\n\nOnboard Scharnhorst the dedicated torpedo lookouts had seen the torpedoes leave Acasta’s tubes and the ship took evasive action to avoid them\n\nAfter successfully withdrawing back into her own smokescreen, the crew of Acasta prepared for a follow-up attack. However, the element of surprise was lost and the German ship’s fully expected Acasta to execute additional torpedo runs. As Acasta exited the smokescreen she came under intense fire and was hit.\n\nA hit and subsequent explosion near Acasta’s aft-torpedo tubes knocked the torpedo operator, Leading Seaman Nick Carter unconscious. When he regained consciousness he was lying between the torpedo tubes with the torpedo crew dead around him and a large hole in the deck.\n\nDazed from the concussion of the explosion, Carter realised that the four torpedoes were still housed in their tubes and another shell from the German ships could sympathetically detonate them. Carter climbed back into the chair and fired the torpedoes at the nearest German ships which he noted “was pointing at one of the great German ships”.\n\nWith the torpedoes away, Carter shouted upto the bridge and informed them he had jettisoned the torpedoes. He then went to assist the gun crews and prepare for abandoning ship\n\n18:39 – Scharnhorst Wounded\n\nUnlike Acasta’s previous torpedo spread one of these torpedoes ran true and found its target.\n\nThe “great battleship” that Carter’s had seen through his sights was Scharnhorst.\n\nAlthough Scharnhorst took evasive actions to avoid the torpedoes fired by Carter, through either a misunderstanding or miscalculation, Scharnhorst returned to the original course too soon and while still within the arc of danger posed by the torpedoes\n\nAt 18:39 (17:39) one of Acasta’s torpedoes slammed into Scharnhorst directly below the after ‘C’ turret, causing heavy damage and casualties, and forcing a reduction in speed.\n\nAfter sustaining the hit Scharnhorst veered off to Starboard as the crew assessed the damage and fought the increase of water.\n\nIn his after battle report Marschall wrote\n\n“At this stage of the battle, while Glorious was capsizing “Scharnhorst” received a torpedo hit on the starboard side by the after turret as was revealed later the hole torn in the ship’s side was of considerable extent. The magazines of the heavy turret were directly penetrated and caught fire. The starboard engine was put out of action, and the starboard shaft with the shaft mountings was torn away from the hull, A large amount of water entered the ship; the ship’s situation was becoming difficult, and in particular the middle engine room was gradually filled with water. The ship still continued the action with the destroyer which was now very heavily damaged.\n\nDue to confusion over the evasive maneuvers executed by Scharnhorst to evade Acasta’s torpedoes, the German’s initially believed that the torpedo that damaged Scharnhorst was not fired by Acasta and must have come from a submarine\n\nAbove: Damage caused by the torpedo that hit Scharnhorst on 8 June 1940.\n\n19:24 – The Battle Closes\n\nWith Acasta severely damaged, aflame and sinking the German ships ceased fire, certain that Acasta would soon sink.\n\nThe damage sustained by Scharnhorst was significant and needed urgent attention. Shortly afterwards the German ships altered course for Trondheim at Scharnhorst’s best speed, then about 20 knots.\n\nDue to the belief that Scharnhorst had been torpedoed by a submarine and not by Acasta, no attempt was made to recover survivors for fear it would hazard the German ship’s.\n\nAbove: German cruiser Gneisenau, Admiral Hipper & Scharnhorst at Trondheim, Norway, June 11, 1940.\n\n8 – 10 June, 1940 – The Plight of the Survivors\n\nIt is estimated that nearly 900 survivors from the three ships entered the water. The near freezing conditions greatly reduced the survivors chances and many succumbed within the first few hours.\n\nTo be finished\n\n10 June, 1940 – Norway Falls\n\nTwo days later the Norwegian forces on the mainland capitulated to the Germans on 10 June 1940. Units fighting on the front had been ordered to disengage in the early hours of 8 June. Fighting ceased at 24:00 on 9 June. The formal capitulation agreement for forces fighting in mainland Norway was signed at the Britannia Hotel in Trondheim at 17:00 on 10 June 1940. Lieutenant Colonel Ragnvald Roscher Nielsen signed for the Norwegian forces, Colonel Erich Buschenhagen for the German side. A capitulation agreement for the Norwegian forces fighting at Narvik was also signed the same day, at Bjørnfjell. The signatories of this agreement, the last local capitulation of Norwegian troops during the campaign, were General Eduard Dietl for the Germans, and Lieutenant Colonel Harald Wrede Holm for the Norwegians. The 62-day campaign made Norway the country to withstand a German invasion for the longest period of time, aside from the Soviet Union"
