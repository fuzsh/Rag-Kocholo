        "text": "I think it makes sense that some thing like the RLAA would be formed in the twenties and I can't see the Allies objecting since it's purpose is purely defensive. Whats even better about this idea is that it will be under Army control for about a good ten years before the Nasties take over so Goering might not be able to take it over or at least not right away. if he does take it over it wont be till around the mid to late 30s and by then it should be an organized department with it's own doctrine and procedures. Hopefully who ever Goering puts in charge of the Dept. won't see a reason to make too many changes.\n\nhttp://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12484\n\nhttp://www.german-helmets.com/LUFTSCHUTZ_MAIN.htm\n\nThere was a sort of organization that would double for what you are talking about here.\n\nDer Deutsche Luftschutz-Liga was one example, but these were private organizations as the government could ill afford to spend on expensive defensive measures in the 1920s. There was of course planning for these things within the Reichswehr, but it was in context of military measures and civilian components to air defense were not created until 1937 (Luftschutzwarndienst LSW), but was auxiliary to the Luftwaffe. The real change would have to be in 1933-5 when Goering was amassing authority for 'his' Luftwaffe, which would see even a 1920's air defense organization absorbed in the Luftwaffe. Perhaps the military insists for some reason to keep that power away from Goering to limit his influence?\n\nAny reason why we can't give the RLAA an early start in the 20s? A country without an airforce would be naturally interested in alternative defences against the strategic air attacks being theorised at the time.\n\nIt could be an ostensively civil defence organisation, with a small military component, (They were not allowed AA guns above 25mm) that would take it over and be in excelent position to expand in 1934. The following crises, at a time when the LW was still weak, would favor investment in the RLAA, set up from the start as a rapidly expandable force using the many AA designs prepared as part of the 18 series.\n\nThis will allow us to justify the RLAA independence from the LW, and it's size and relevance...\n\nI think it is banned by ToW to have AAA. But trying to dodge this agreement can be a way to get the LW and RLAA separate. Look for things less likely to anger France in the early days. Maybe the buildings that will become Flak towers are bomb shelters that are really dual purpose and converted. Or if that is too strong, maybe the RLAA starts with actions in Switzerland. A lot of German aces ended up in Switzerland in the interwar years, so maybe German money funds small test operations in Switzerland. The swiss have a tradition of huge defense budgets, so a test Flak tower going up in Zurich in 1928 might not raise too many eye brows.\n\nEdit: Pretty sure you have a big ToV issue here. If we are going to buff the Nazi by clearly breaking the ToV, why no just build fighter planes too in the 1920's.? You need a more subtle method.\n\nI'm seriously starting to wonder if it might not just be easier to create Luftflotte Reich in 1937 or something along those lines:\n\nhttp://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation history/WW2/luft44.htm\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftflotte_Reich\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftflotte_Reich\n\nIts commander had solid early war air defense credentials:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Jürgen_Stumpff\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Jürgen_Stumpff\n\nAm 1. September 1933 wechselte er als Oberstleutnant zu der im Aufbau begriffenen Luftwaffe, wo er zunächst Chef des Personalamts wurde. Vom 1. Juni 1937 bis zum 31. Januar 1939 war er Chef des Generalstabes der Luftwaffe. Als solcher war er wesentlich am Aufbau der Luftstreitkräfte beteiligt und wurde 1938 zum General der Flieger befördert. Von Anfang 1939 bis Anfang 1940 fungierte er als Chef der Luftwehr.\n\nOn 1 September 1933 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel to the incipient Air Force, where he became first head of the personnel office. From 1 June 1937 to 31 January 1939, he was Chief of the General Staff of the Air Force. As such, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Air Force and in 1938 was the Air General transported. From early 1939 to early 1940, he served as chief of air defense.\n\nEdit:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organi...l_.E2.80.93_Luftflotten_and_Fliegerdivisionen\n\nOperational level – Luftflotten and Fliegerdivisionen\n\nSix Luftkreise (Air Service Commands) were established on 1 April 1934. These were each the size of an Air Corps and were basic territorial units of the Luftwaffe following its geographical organization. Their headquarters were as given in the table:[18]\n\nLuftkreise Headquarters.[18]\n\nLuftkreis Headquarters\n\nLuftkreis I Königsberg\n\nLuftkreis II Berlin\n\nLuftkreis III Dresden\n\nLuftkreis IV Münster\n\nLuftkreis V Munich\n\nLuftkreis VI (sea) Kiel\n\nEach Luftkreis was led by a Höherer Fliegerkommandeur (Senior Air Commander) in charge of all aviation units within its area. These included, two or three Luftgaukommandos (administrative commands), a signals command, a medical battalion and a procurement and supply group. Their area of operations also included civilian airfields and Civil Air Defense. The following year, all the replacement battalions in that area also came under their control. In 1936, these were extended to regiment size or Fliegerersatzregimente. From 1935–36, Flak units in the area also came under their command.[18]\n\nHermann Göring and Erhard Milch appointed retired army lieutenant generals to lead each Luftkreis. These were Hans Halm, Edmund Wachenfeld and Leonhard Kaupisch. They were promoted to General der Flieger. A retired navy officer, Konrad Zander, was similarly promoted and put in charge of Luftkreis VI supporting the naval units. Two Luftwaffe officers, Colonel Hugo Sperrle and Major General Karl Schweickhard were put in charge of the remaining two Luftkreise without being promoted.[18]\n\nOperationally, the Luftwaffe organization underwent changes in July 1938. Luftkreise were consolidated into three Luftwaffengruppenkommandos (Airforce Group Commands). As a result, on 1 August 1938, Luftwaffenkommando Ostpreußen (Airforce Command East Prussia) replaced Luftkreis 1. This change also rendered the three digit Geschwader identifiers meaningless. From 1 November 1938, Geschwader identifiers were changed universally. The third digit of the Unit Identifier was replaced with the same digit as its parent Luftwaffengruppenkommando. For example, all units under Luftwaffengruppenkommando 1 (headquartered in Berlin), had the third digit of their identifiers replaced with a '1'. For units under Luftwaffengruppenkommando Ostpreußen, the third digit was replaced with a zero.[19]\n\nBy the end of April 1939, another Luftwaffengruppenkommando was added. All four Luftwaffengruppenkommando were renamed Luftflotte (Air Fleets). Geschwaders under each Luftflotte, were re-numbered sequentially. Each Luftflotte received a batch of 25. For example Luftflotte 1 Geschwaders were numbered 0–25, Luftflotte 2 Geschwaders became 26–50 and so on.[19]\n\nLuftgaue\n\nWithin the Air Ministry, for administration purposes, the Luftwaffe was organized into Luftgaue (Air Districts). It was led by a person of Generalmajor or air commodore rank and a staff of 50 to 150 Officers and enlisted personnel. A Luftgau was responsible for all administrative activities, such as training, administration, maintenance, air defense, signals, recruitment and reserve personnel. The Generalmajor leading each Luftgau reported to the Air Ministry. Those Luftgaue established within Germany were numbered non-consecutively with roman numerals. Luftgaue established in occupied Europe were named after their location.[2][20] Each Luftgau had its own section for the following areas:\n\nOperations\n\nAdjutant\n\nLegal\n\nAdministration\n\nSignals\n\nSupply\n\nRestricted flying areas\n\nThese sections were numbered in Arabic numerals followed by a Luftgau designator. For example, section 3 of Luftgau VI would be designated '3/VI'. Flying units used the services of a Luftgau through Flughafenbereichkommandanturen (Airfield Regional Commands). Each Luftgau usually had five such commands. Each regional command was divided into five or more Einsatzhafenkommandanturen (Operational Airfield Commands). The operational commands were located at the airfields where it serviced the flying units.[20]\n\nLuftflotte\n\nFlag of the Chief of a Luftflotte\n\nOperationally under the OKL, all Luftwaffe units were organized into Luftflotte, which were equivalent to an army group. Its size and number of subordinated units, was flexible and changed depending on need. The Luftflotten were created according to the geographical area. As new territories came under occupation, new Luftflotten were created. Each Luftflotte, had an adjutant or staff officer assisting the commanding officer. Although a Luftflotte could be moved from one area to another by the RLM, the Luftflotte had absolute control over all aspects of aviation in that area, including ground operations. This also included legal, administration, signals and supply work. They were essentially divided into operational or administrative commands. The signal services consisted of three Luft-Nachrichtenregimenter (signals regiments) in a Luftflotte. There was also a Fliegerabwehrkanone (Flak) unit.[2][21]\n\nWe first need to understand how and why the Luftwaffe was organized the way it was to change it properly. Creating a Luftflotte Reich would mean that all of the Luftflotte services described above would be under a central authority and the Luftflotte 1-6 would have to be focused on external targets and be miniature versions of the main Luftflotte Reich with all FLAK units being initially posted to this main air fleet and cleared through it to other air fleets when they are posted abroad, but pre-war when all fleets are based in Germany the ground and administrative functions are handled by one 'over' authority, the Luftflotte Reich. I think it would make more sense over all if the numbered Luftflotte were focused on offensive action and organization, while the actual defense, including everything involved with that in Germany, be focused on one specialist 'über' fleet. Then we could see a 'Dowding' system, that would probably be either a Kammhüber early version or something the Stumpff himself creates. It would also help if all things radar were then concentrated in this Luftflotte Reich, which then offers enormous potential for early and alternate development for radar types (dipole and centimetric), and for day and night defenses."
