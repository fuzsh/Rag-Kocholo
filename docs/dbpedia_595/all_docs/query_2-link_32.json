        "text": "Gdynia, Poland – The Polish Air Force has identified Major Robert “Killer” Jel as the pilot who tragically lost his life during a training session ahead of the planned air show in Gdynia. Major Jel, a distinguished pilot with the M-346 Demo Team, was fatally injured when his aircraft crashed just before 1 PM on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe incident occurred as Major Jel’s M-346 Bielik advanced training aircraft was performing a barrel-roll manoeuvre. For reasons that remain unclear, the aircraft dived towards the ground and failed to recover, resulting in a catastrophic impact. Despite his extensive experience and efforts to regain control, Major Jel did not eject from the aircraft.\n\nThe air show, scheduled to take place at the military airport in Babie Doly, was set to begin on Saturday at 9:30 AM. It was to feature performances by the M-346 Demo Team, the F-16 Tiger Demo Team, and other aircraft from the Polish Armed Forces. However, in light of the tragic accident, the event has been cancelled as a mark of respect and to ensure the safety of all participants.\n\nMajor Robert “Killer” Jel was a highly respected and accomplished pilot within the Polish Air Force. He was the deputy squadron commander at the 41st Training Aviation Base in Deblin. He was a very experienced pilot, his flight time was over 2,000 hours spent in the air, including 1,100 hours at the controls of the M-346. He held the distinction of being the first pilot in Poland to exceed 1,000 hours of flight time on the M-346 Bielik aircraft, a testament to his skill and dedication. His contributions to the M-346 Demo Team and the broader aviation community were significant, and his loss is deeply felt by his colleagues and the entire nation. The lost “7714” was only about 2 years old and was one of the last aircraft of this type received by the Polish Air Force.\n\nThe M-346 Demo Team is part of the 4th Training Aviation Wing, based at the esteemed 41st Training Air Base in Deblin, Poland. Formed just last year, the team quickly gained recognition for their impressive aerial displays, debuting at the 2023 Radom Airshow to widespread acclaim. Their performances showcased advanced manoeuvres such as loops, rolls, and high-G turns, highlighting the capabilities of the M-346 Bielik aircraft and the exceptional skill of its pilots.\n\nIn addition to his flying prowess, Major Jel was known for his dedication to mentoring younger pilots and his commitment to advancing the standards of military aviation. His legacy includes not only his remarkable flying achievements but also his contributions to the training and development of future generations of pilots.\n\nThe Polish Air Force has launched a thorough investigation into the crash to determine the factors that led to the tragic incident. Preliminary reports suggest that both mechanical failure and pilot error are being considered as potential causes. The investigation team will analyze videos of the crash, the wreckage, and maintenance logs to piece together what happened that day.\n\nAll flights of the M-346 aircraft in the Polish Air Force have been suspended. In the wake of this tragedy, support services have been made available to Major Jel’s family and colleagues.\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks faced by military aviators and the bravery required to perform at the highest levels. The Polish Air Force and the entire nation mourn the loss of a skilled pilot and a dedicated serviceman, whose legacy will be remembered with honor and respect."
