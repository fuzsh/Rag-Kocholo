HISTORIAN’S FOREWORD This is the first History of World War 11 to present a complete pano^ rama of the greatest struggle in human history, with authentic text, of&cial photographs, maps, records, and documents in a single volume. Its service is to give homes, schools, and libraries a standard work in which the reader may obtain a comprehensive understanding of the epoch-making events through which we have passed. Here we witness the organization of the greatest armies, navies, and air forces the world has ever known— the gigantic battles on land, sea, and in the air— the might of industrial power and production. We have lived through the most stupendous struggle in the 7,000 years of recorded history. The destiny of 70 nations and 2,000,000,000 people has been at stake. The homelands of more than three quarters of the population of the earth have felt the iron heel of war. More than 100,000,000, one out of every twenty human beings on the globe, have been engaged in the fighting forces of belligerent nations. The records of World War II, as set forth in this volume, challenge the imagination. The official lists of numbers killed and wotmded are a tragic commentary on civilization: more than 20,000,000 casualties; 30.000. 000 more men, women, and children driven from their homes; 10.000. 000 more massacred; hundreds of thousands of homes left in ruins. The cost of this “War for Survival,” with its destruction, devastation, and economic losses, is estimated at the sum of $1,000,000,000,000. The great wealth of the world, with its resources, industrial power, and man power, has been concentrated on destruction. Nations have accumulated an indebtedness which far exceeds all the money in the world. The responsibility for meeting this obligation is placed upon future generations to carry the burden. This is the price we have paid for human freedom. The amount of money consumed in this war is sufficient to build a home for every family in die world, or to give an education to every child on earth. It is far greater than all the moneys ever expended for schools, churches, and hospitals since the beginning of the human race. We have, therefore, endeavored to make this History of World War II a human history, treating men and events as they directly affect our own lives. The causes which created this human tragedy are herein analyzed, with sketches of the leading personalities and backgrounds of the nations involved. V, yi History of World War II Military events are clearly visualized from the outbreak of the war to its final battles. Our purpose has been to present these with such clarity that you may follow your own “boys” through to the final victory and re-live the experiences through which they passed. This service has been accomplished through the organization of a staff of experts, specialists, and analysts under the direction of a historian-general. (The list of staff authorities and writers is given on pages iii and iv, and in the section, “Authorities and Official Sources” on pages 939-941. Divisional chiefs were “on duty” at desks over which more than 60,000 words from the battlefronts passed every day. Official communiques from all parts of the world were analyzed each day, with reports and proclamations issued by all the Governments. As each event was officially confirmed, it was transcribed into historical narrative for this book and coordinated by the historian-general. Throughout the war, conferences were held with official sources, military authorities, and communications with diplomats and statesmen, supplemented by the information organizations representing thirty nations. While it was the first great “War in the Air,” coordinated with land and sea forces, it may also be called the “War of the Scientists,” in which invention, discovery, mechanical genius, and mass production take a foremost part. Through this new age of radio, with the elimina- tion of time and space the whole world was in instant communication. Through cinematography and radio photography, the scenes of action were brought immediately into our homes. The war passed before our eyes on motion picture screens and was preserved on films to pass before the eyes of generations to come. Another war on this gigantic scale, with further development of instruments for destruction by scientific genius, would place the human race in danger of self-annihilation. Therefore, a clear understanding of World War ll is essentiaf for our own self-preservation. The time has come, if we are to survive as peoples and nations, when some cooperative plan must be agreed upon whereby wars can be stopped at their point of inception— some plan whereby we can all live together in peace and security. This History of World War II is dedicated to that great forward step in human progress. It stands also as a memorial to those who fought and died for this achievement. The colossal magnitude of this war may be visualized when we state that the armies and navies en- gaged in World War II would form a marching line of men in combat reaching four times around the earth in continuous procession.

The keynote of success of these forces tvas Allied unity of thought, purpose and deed in all ranks and echelons, without which the utter military defeat of Germany could not have been achieved. I must pay equal tribute to every soldier of the United Nations who fought with me. Great Britain, Canada, and her other Dominions, France, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway and Den- mark, as well as to our Comrades in Arms, the gallant men and women of the Soviet Armies. To this fine fighting team the American soldier brought the best Am erican traditions both as representatives of our nation and as fight- ing men. Moulded by long months of varied and arduous training in the United States, he has been tried and tested in all aspects of combat under the most rigorous conditions of weather and terrain against a vicious and fanatical enemy. He repeatedly demonstrated- a high degree of individual initiative, resourcefulness, energy and physical and moral stamina until now he has emerged victorious. The success of our Armies would have been utterly impossible with- out the magnificent support of the American people in supplying an almost insatiable demand for the sinews of war. For they made our country the “Arsenal of Democracy” and made good our boast as the best fed, best clothed, best equipped, and best medically cared-for Army in history. Equally impossible would this feat of arms have been with- out complete cooperation on land, on the sea, and in the air. Through the combined and coordinated efforts of all arms and services the final goal was achieved. Commanders, staffs, and men are worthy of the highest praise which can be paid them.. And to those who died that this great victory might be won, we can repay them only by ensurmg that the peace will be as surely won as the military victory for which they gave their lives. The keynote of a successful peace is teamwork and unity of purpose among the free nations of the world; that same teamwork which brought us through the dark days of Nazi triumphs to the final defeat of Germany. Contributed by GENERAL DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER_ to this H!st^ of World Wtu 11— Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces writes^ this tribute to bis comrades for permanent record in this historical repository. GENERAL HEADQUARTERS SOUTHWEST PACIFIC AREA oh’B'ice: of a?HE commanoer-in-chikf Words alone are inadequate to describe the noble heights to which our fighting men have risen in the campaigns culminating in Philip- pine liberation. Of a peace-loving race and stranger to the sword, in our Country’s cause they have perfected mastery of the sword. Through a valor unsurpassed in military annals and with an unconquerable spirit which is the very cornerstone to our country’s greatness, they have forced the enemy relentlessly back to his own Empire fortress or de- stroyed him where he elected to stand. Neither the worst of Nature’s barriers, deadly disease and pestilence, nor the defensive dispositions of a fanatical enemy could halt them in this resolute forward advance. These men from every state in the American Union — ^indeed from every city in every state — ^are a cross section of our people. In theirs, the future of our country — ^in peace or war — crests in strong and reli- able hands. On their record, written unforgettably throughout the Far East, all Americans may find justifiable pride — on it Our Flag has been enshrined in new glory, new dignity, and new honor. Very sincerely. MESSAGE SENT BY GENERAL MacARTHOR FROM THE PHILIFPINBS TO THIS MEMORIAL HISnjRY QF WORLD WAR U WHAT WE FOUGHT FOR IN WORLD WAR 11 Official Statements By FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT President of the United States during World War II — Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy President Roosevelt, upon request of the historians for this volume, sent from the White House a personal letter in which he stated: “I have had some extracts made from my addresses and messages from which I think you may gather suitable material.” These selections from his writings, presented to us under title, “Some Pertinent Statements by the President on What We Are Fighting For,” are herewith given historical record. They constitute what may be called by historians the “Ten Commandments of World War 11.” 7. We are not a tvarli\\e people. We have never sought glory as a nation of warriors. We are not interested in aggression. We are not interested — as the dictators are — in looting. We do not covet one square inch of the territory of any other nation. Our vast effort, and the unity of purpose which inspires that effort are due solely to our recognition of the fact that our fundamentcd rights are threatened by Hitler's violent attempt to rule the world. These rights were established by our fore- fathers on the field of battle. They have been defended— at great cost but with great success — on the field of battle, here on our own soil, and in foreign lands, and on all the seas all over the world. There has never been a moment in our history when Americans were not ready to stand up as free men and fight for their rights. II. Together with other free peoples, we are now fighting to maintain our right to live among our world neighbors in freedom and in com- mon decency, without fear of assault. III. We are fighting today for security, for progress and for peace, not only for ourselves, but for all men, not only for one generation but for all generations. We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils, ancient ills. We are fighting as our fathers have fought, to up- hold the doctrine that cdl men are equal in the sight of God. IV. On the desert sands of Africa, along the thousands of miles of battle lines in Russia, in Hew Zealand and Australia and the islands of the Pacific, in war-torn China and all over the seven seas, free men are fighting desperately— and dying— to preserve the liberties and the de- cencies of modem civilization. F. The essence of our struggle is that men shall he free. There can be no real freedom for the common man without enlightened social policies. In last analysis they are the stages for which democracies are today fighting. VL We are figting to free the people of this earth from the most powerful, the most ruthless, the most savage enemy the world has ever seen. We are dedicating all that we have and all that we are to the combat. We will not stop this side of victory. VIL It is useless to win battles if the cause for which we fought these battles is lost. It is useless to win a war unless it stays won. We, therefore, fight for the restoration and perpetuation of faith and hope throughout the world. The objective of today is clear and realistic. It is to destroy completely the military power of Germany, Italy, and Japan to such good purpose that their threat against us and all the other United Nations cannot he revived a generation hence. VIII. The overwhelming majority of all the people in the world want peace. Most of them are fighting for the attainment of peace — not just a truce, not just an armistice — but peace that is as strongly enforced and as durable as mortal can ma\\e it . . • ♦ American hoys are fighting to- day in snow-covered mountains, in malarial jungles, etc., and the thing for which they struggle is best symbolized by the message that came out of Bethlehem. IX. Today this nation, which George Washington helped so greatly to create, is fighting all over this earth in order to maintain for our- selves and for our children the freedom which George Washington helped so greatly to achieve. X. In this war of survival we must \\eep before our minds not only the evil things we fight against but the good things we are fighting for. We fight to retain a great past — and we fight to gain a greater future. The issue of this war is the basic issue between those who believe in mankind and those who do not — the ancient issue between those who put their faith in the people and those who put their faith in dictators and tyrants.

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY AIR FORCES WASHINGTON First of all, may I tell you how much I appreciate your asking me to participate in your historical record. I must warn you, however, that any record of the accomplishments of the Army Air Forces in the past three years is in my mind a more fit subject for a thousand-page volume than a letter, however heartfelt. Therefore, I believe it will be more fruitful if I confine myself to a few of the highlights of our his- tory in the past few years. . . . Remember, if you will, what the Japanese did to our Air Force in the first weeks of this war. We had 526 airplanes deployed to meet possible attacks on Hawaii and the Philippines. Within a few hours that num- ber was reduced to 176. In the Philippines were our last two worn-out P-4o’s and a couple of Japanese ships with 500-pound bombs hitched to the wings — ^and then they, too, were lost. . Exactly two and a half years after those P-4o’s went down, twenty thousand American airmen flew over the English Channel on their zero hour D-Day mission One of the basic elements of aerial offensive is, of course, strategic bombardment— one of the great developments of modern warfare. Complex as its separate aspects appear, its basic principles are simple. At the Casablanca conference the Combined Chiefs of Staff were able to state the aims of our bombing offensive in a siogle sentence. Our objective was “the progressive destruction and dislocation of the Ger- man military and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resist- ance is fatally weakened.” We knew that, to accomplish this, the United States had to produce enough airplanes, build enough bases, train enough men to make up the largest and best Air Force in the world. And we could not wait to begin operations until all the aircraft were built and all the crews ready. The 17th of August, 1942, was D-Day for die AAF’s offensive against Germany. On that day, our first heavy bombers took off from English bases to bomb a target at Rouen. Less than two years later, on the 6th of June, 1944, die Luftwaffe was unable to offer serious opposition to the landing of our Ground forces in Normandy. ... Our heavy bomber missions brought cumulative disruption into the entire German war economy. When we stopped production in the ball-bearing factories in Schweinfurt and Berlin, we created shortages that effected the makmg of tanks, artillery, engines— in fact of any of the special weapons of moderp. war. We diverted millions of able- bodied Germans to the jobs of aircraft defense, plant dispersal and camouflage, shelter building wreckage, disposal, and warning services. We did not, o£ course, neglect our tactical air arm. Tactical Air Forces are composed of lighter aircraft— the medium bombers and fighters — although heavy bombers are sometimes used for tactical purposes. By tactical purposes I mean the attainment of more or less immediate objectives. In our implement of tactical air power we have arrived at what appears to be an extremely sound set of basic principles. We have found these principles as simple as they are efiective. First, we neutralize the enemy’s air power by hitting his airdromes or taking out his planes in aerial combat Second, we isolate a battle area of our own choice by cutting enemy supply and communication lines, such as bridges and railroads. We call this process interdiction. Third, and last, our tactical Air Forces cooperate in the closest pos- sible way with our advancing or defending grotmd troops. These were our guiding principles in the drive against North Africa and up the Italian peninsula, in France, in Germany, as well as in New Guinea, and along the last of the long road to Japan. In this war, control of the air has come to be an absolute prerequisite of success on land or sea. ... But the Army Air Forces must never rest on their laurels— not even after the defeat of Japan. An Air Force can never stand still; it must either go forward or be left hopelessly behind. The aircraft types of a year ago are today either obsolete, obsolescent, or about to become so. And the same will hold true for our present types in the very near future. The battle of the laboratories knows no armistice. At the same time an Air Force is not a question of laboratories alone. We do not dare ever again to cut our best in training facilities down below the needs of the largest and best Air Force the world has known. We must never again relinquish the leadership first seized by Wilbur and Orville Wright. To retain that leadership will not be an easy matter. It must be done. I am confident the American people will see to it that we shall. Sincerely, UNITED STATES FLEET HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF NAVY DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON 25. D. C. We have every reason to be proud of what our mili tary and naval forces have achieved in Europe. However, we cannot — and must not —entertain any belief that, because organized resistance has ceased on the part of the German enemy, the war is “about over,” We congratulate the United States Army — and the armed forces of our Allies — for effecting the actual entry into Germany and destroy- ing her ability to make war. We congratulate the air forces for their victory over the Luftwaffe, and for their support of those engaged in fighting on the ground. Though there were few naval surface actions in the Atlantic in the traditional sense, the Navy’s contribution to the European victory was substantial. The winning of the Battle of the Atlantic against the U-boats was a requisite to the winning of the Battle of Europe. The Allied navies landed our ground forces on the soil of Normandy and, despite the enemy’s U-boat campaigns, maintained the flow of sup- plies, The Navy further assisted Allied ground forces in the climactic crossing of the Rhine barrier. This operation, as all others, required the closest cooperation between the United States Army and Navy, While we now congratulate those who have achieved victory in Europe we must not forget those thousands who gave their lives fight- ing to make this victory possible. They died that we might have the privilege of continuing to enjoy American liberty as we have known it. Our sympathy and our humble appreciation go out to their bereaved families and friends. During the past year the war in the Pacific has progressed at an accelerated tempo. In that area we are still securing positions from which to launch heavier and more concentrated offensives against the Japanese homeland. At the same time, the closer we get to the heart of Japan, the stronger we find her resistance — ^as we experienced on Saipan, and on Iwo Jima, and, more recently, on Okinawa. The farther we advance the longer our vital supply lines become, further compli- cating our already complex logistic system. The problem of convoying the millions of troops now in Europe halfway around the world to the Far East is one of the most immense which any naval force ever faced. To supply them once they get there will be almost equally difficult. These problems must be— and are being —solved even as we continue to press home the campaigns now under way in the far Pacific. Coordination of effort among the fighting forces and the efforts of workers on the home front have made possible our success so far and will continue to be essential to ultimate victory. We sincerely wish that this could have been a day of victory on all fronts, but we know that the tough kernel of Japanese resistance re- mains to be crushed. Hence, we must pursue the war in the Pacific with increased determination, and \\yith the maximum of equipment and trained personnel. Therefore make this not a day of celebration primarily, but rather a day of rededication to the task that yet remains ahead of us — total and rapid defeat of the Japanese enemy. E. J. KING, Fleet Admiral, U. S. Navy. V-E DAY (MAY 8 , 1945) RADIO STATEMENT BY FLEET ADMIRAL E J KING, U. S NAVY HEADQUARTERS U. S. MARINE CORPS WASHINGTOM' It is a pleasure to accept the kind invitation of the Historical Foun- dations of World War II to oudine the achievements of the men of the Marine Corps during this war. The Marine Corps is an integral part of the United States Navy. As the land-arm of the Navy, the Corps is prepared by study, practice, and tradition to carry out the land-fighting phases of amphibious operations. The men of our Fleet Marine Force are especially trained for ship-to- shore assault and the subsequent hard fighting usually necessary to wrest the objective from hostile defending forces. Since the war against Japan has been predominately amphibious in nature — ^has, in fact, been by far the greatest amphibious conflict of all time, the Marine Corps has been committed almost entirely to the War in the Pacific. The men of the Corps have fought throughout the war with unsur- passable heroism and skill, in keeping with the traditions of their Corps and their national heritage. Their record of indomitable fighting service in defense of their country began in the very first hours of the war, when the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor, Wake Island, the Philip- pines, and Guam. Aboard ships and ashore. Marines bore their share of the fighting and the maintenance of order throughout the enemy’s sudden air attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Casualties in our ranks, as among all other service personnel there, were heavy. In the Philippines a Marine force, drawn mostly from the Fourth Marine Regiment, fought alongside Army troops throughout the heroic delaying straggle against overwhelming enemy ground and air power on Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor. The first all-Marine action of World War II was the epic stand at Wake Island where a garrison of only four hundred Marines and a Marine air fighter squadron held off for fourteen days a major Japanese task force attempting to make a landing. Actually, the fighter squadron never had more than four planes in operation (others were damaged on the groimd by enemy air action), but the dauntless pilots of those four planes at one time forced the task force to retreat and sank a large cruiser. The enemy, after suffering sharp losses in ships and men, finally effected a landing and overran the island on December 23. Our naval base at Guam also was attacked on December 7 and cap- tured by the Japanese after its garrison of slightly more than one hun- dred Marines and a small naval complement put up a gallant but futile fight. At Guadalcanal, on August 7, 1942, our First Marine Division Re- enforced drove ashore in the first American ground offensive of the war, beginning a long but steady march by Allied forces 3,000 miles across the Pacific to the Japanese homeland. From Guadalcanal on, our men never were turned back. Every land- ing operation ended in the complete seizure of the objective. In almost every instance, the Japanese garrisons fought to stem the advance with desperate fanaticism. To defeat them — ^to break through and crush them in their huge blockhouses, their pill boxes, and their mazes of heavily fortified positions — called for the highest in courage and skill. And the highest never was lacking. . . . The Marine Corps also has taken a vital part in the aerial offensive in the Pacific, Marine pilots, flying both land and carrier-based planes, have served in many capacities throughout the Pacific battle area. From Midway to the Philippines, from Wake Island to a carrier off Tokyo, they have supported ground operations, destroyed enemy shipping, im- mobilized by-passed enemy strongholds, attacked enemy airdromes, scouted enemy activities, defended American-held bases, and carried troops, cargo, and mail to front-line fields. Marine airmen have distinguished themselves unfailingly in every operation to which they have been assigned. Throughout our history. Marines have served aboard the capital war- ships of the Navy. In this war, our fighting ships’ complements have proudly maintained the high traditions established and upheld by the seagoing Marines of the past. Please extend to the Board of Historians my sincerest thanks for the kind regards expressed in your letter, and also my best wishes in respect to the preparation of your History of World War II. Sincerely yours. General A. A. Vandegrift Commandant of the United States Marine Coi^s CNITEt) STATES PAClflC FLEET AND PACIFIC OCEAN AEEAS BEADaVABTEBS OF THE COMHAKDEE IK CHIBf This is a day for which the world’s people who understand freedom and justice have long prayed. The forces of tyranny and aggression in Europe are crushed. The way is open there for the resumption of the onward march of progress and civilization. The victory of the allied forces is the work of many hands and man y minds. It is a victory for our armed forces but also a victory for the in- dustries that armed them. It is a victory won by united effort at home and in the zones of combat. This is particularly a day of glory for General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme Allied commander, and for the leaders of our gallant Army. Generals Marshall, Arnold, McNair, Stilwell, Somervell, Bradley, Patch, Hodges, Simpson, Patton, Spaatz, and others have earned the admira- tion and gratitude of this and future generations. Today we also honor our staunch Allies: The British Commonwealth of Nations, which never faltered, never flinched in spite of setbacks and the dark outlook when she stood alone; Russia, which was nearly over- run by Hitler’s legions in 1942 but staged a magnificent rally unmatched in military history to eject the attackers from her soil; and our other allies who, with more limited military resources, nevertheless extended to us unlimited cooperation. Above all, today we honor the valiant men of the United Nations who gave their lives in defense of their homes, and all things enlight- ened people hold dear. The record of their victories, and the memory of their valor will never die. C. W. n«0t Adndral^ U* S* Vttvy* Excerpt of tribute radiioed to \"victorious Allied Forces on V-E Day by Fleet Admiral C. W. Nimitz. U. S. Navy, Commander in Chief U,S. Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Areas— Contributed by Admiral Niimtz for nistorical record. WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON We Have 3eep and Just cause to be thankful to a beneficent Provi- dence on this day — ^thankful for the strength and endurance of our Allies, thankful that we have been able to raise up a mighty Army in time to meet the dangers that confronted us, thankful for the skill of our commanders and the courage and initiative of our soldiers that have brought to successful conclusion one of the great military feats of history. We should be deeply grateful also, that science, industry and labor have wrought the wonders of production that have allowed our fighting forces to confound the enemy with speed and fire power at sea, on land, in the air. We have won a mighty victory in less time and with less loss than we had any right to expect. And as we pay solemn tribute to those who have died to save our civilization we thank the God who has blessed our cause to this present victory and pray for His continued help until the task is done. The German nation united science and industry to the cause of degenerate barbarism. They turned their full manpower, long trained to war, to the conquest of the world that they might banish from it all the higher aspirations of mankind. Their vile ambitions are shattered. Their leader is no more. The savage ambition he taught them is defeated. But the void in their char- acter and the infection of their depravity still abides with them. They must be watched lest they again poison civilization. On the other side of the world the Japanese have likewise taken savage conquest and brutal rule as a national aspiration and justified it, like the Germans, by a self-adjudged superiority. Hirohito follows the downward paths of Mussolini and Hitler. His fading power for evil must and shall be utterly destroyed. We are fighting one vast war for a decent world. We shall continue that war wherever it has to be fought with all our righteous might until the last sign of power in our enemies has disappeared from sight. /C Seaetary of War HISTORICAL RECORD OF SECRETARY OF WAR HENRY L. STIMSON’S STATEMENT TO THE NATION OVER THE RADIO ON V-E DAY-AUTOGRAPHED BY HIM FOR PRESERVATION IN THIS MEMORIAL HISTORY OF WORLD WAR 11 THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY WASHINGTON This war has demonstrated these four primary truths about the sea and air power of our Navy: First: That possession of such power, giving us control of the great reaches of sea in both oceans, means that our enemies cannot bring attacks to our home shores. Second: That the corollary of the above statement is that the places where we fight any nation with which we go to war will be of our choosing and not theirs. Third: That possession of sea power mutiplies the effectiveness of land forces, and may give us what Mahan said British sea power gave Wellington, the multiple use of the limited forces at his disposal — ^they were available to fight Na- poleon in Spain and they could be shifted by water to fight in the Low Countries. Fourth: That however powerful our land and air armies may be, it is command of the sea that enables their power to be ap- plied, whether it is on the coast of North Africa, the beaches of Normandy, the jungles of Luzon, or in the skies over Tokyo. These fundamentals make possible our victory in this war. We should never forget them or neglect the Navy which embodies them. Sincerely yours, James Forrestal . Secretary of the Navy STATEMENT CONTRIBUTED BY SECRETARY FORRESTAL FOR RECORD IN, ' THIS HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II The peoples o£ the British Commonwealth are proud to have had a part in the victory over Germany. We knew the dark days of 1940. In five and a half years we had more than a million casualties. We were mobilised for total war and all that it involved. In Britain we suffered the ruthless bombing of our cities and a wartime way of Ufe made hard by strict rationing, the blackout, and unremitting work. We ac- cepted every burden cheerfully because we knew that it was necessary and regarded it as our contribution to the common effort and sacrifice of the free peoples of the world. In the same spirit we are now marching with our Allies to final victory over Japan and an enduring peace. For this we need above all the unity that has been forged in war. One of the sharpest weapons in the armory of the enemy was a propaganda which aimed at creating disunity and mutual mistrust among the peoples about to be attacked. That weapon was effective until at last it broke on the shield of Allied xmity. For with the gallantry of those who fought, the skill of those who plaimed and the ungrudged service of those who worked, we must rate as a major factor in our victory over Germany the cooperation and comradeship of the peoples of our great alliance. (The Rt. Honorable, the Viscount Halifax, K. G., Ambassador to the United States from Great Britam) SWEHTEN BY LORD HALIFAX FOR MEMORIAL RECORD IN THIS HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II VICTORY OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAUSES AND RESULTS OF WORLD WAR II W E who lived through World War II witnessed the mightiest struggle the world has ever known — ^the war waged by the dictators against the democracies, in which tyranny and despotism threatened to destroy civilization. After six years and one day the gigantic conflict came to its dramatic climax with the unconditional surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, the last of the sinister forces of the Axis “master races” which had started out on the debauched adventure of world conquest. Germany, starting the war on the European front on September i, 1939, had fallen in ruins, the victim of her own mad ambitions, on May 7, 1945, with her great cities in flames and wreckage — cities of the dead. The unconditional surrender in Berlin had come 118 days before the surrender of Japan in Tokyo. Italy, the third of the great Axis partners had fallen by the wayside and surrendered on Sep- tember 8, 1943, nearly two years before the final triumph of the Allied democracies. Japan, following Germany into the war on the side of the Axis when she infamously attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, had been left to fight it out alone on the Asiatic and Pacific fronts. The triumvirate met the most disastrous defeat in history. V-E Day (May 7, 1945) and V-J Day (September 2, 1945) were celebrated throughout the free nations of the world. Millions knelt in the churches in thanksgiving. Millions of soldiers began their prepara- tions for the grand homecoming — ^the war was over. The Germans, who had invaded and subjugated fifteen nations to their iron rule, were now held fast by the great powers of liberation. They had lost every conquered country and themselves been con- quered, to be placed under strict guardianship until their military spirit was broken, their lust for conquest was completely eradicated, and they proved themselves worthy to reenter the family of nations. Herr Hitler was variously reported a suicide, to have been murdered by his own comrades, to have become violently insane, and to have led into hiding. Himmler, Goebbels, and most of the Nazi leaders lad committed suicide. Goering and a host of others had been taken prisoner to be placed on trial for their “war crimes.” ' Generals, field marshals, admirals had shot themselves or been cap- 3 4 History of World War 11 tured. Mussolini had met ignominious death at the hands of Italian patriots and his body hanged in a public square while throngs jeered and spat upon it, kicking and trampling on the lifeless El Duce as he fell to the gutter. Never before in history had such grim retribution come to tyrants and despots. Tragedies were taking place in Japan where Tojo -and many of the warlords were attempting suicide, committing hara-kiri, or being placed on trial for their crimes. No war in history had ever ended with such a wave of self-destruction and confessions of guilt. Never before had the war-makers been stamped as criminals, placed under arrest, found guilty by juries of their fellowmen and executed. The cqsljaf, World War II in human, lives on all fronts, civilian and military, is estimated as high as hfl:,y. million men,, women, and chil- dren. The military losses in killed, wounded, and missing total over twenty million and may eventually be found to reach thirty million. The homeless exceed twenty-five million. The direct cost in money, as stated in the Historian’s Foreword, passed a trillion dollars. The economic cost in destruction and loss of potential life earnings adds another trillion dollars to this colossal expenditure. This sum directed into the constructive channels of peace is sufficient to give every family on earth a substantial home, and a college education to every boy and girl in the world. It is more money'*\"' than has been expended for schools, churches, and hospitals since the birth of Christ. The Axis Powers, plotting to overthrow democracy and establish world dictatorship under Germany, Jtaiy, and Japan, were able to gather but five satellites around them. Fifty nations jojned tl^e United N ations in preservation of human freedom ;^v^emained neutr^J'* Historians are in agreement that World WaFU was the “unfinished phase” of the First World War — the inevitable result of the failure to crush the military power of the exponents of world conquest, which, between the two wars, developed into a “super-race” mania. Documentary evidence proves irrefutably that the Axis plague threatened to set up a reign of terror throughout the earth, overthrow every form of human freedom, destroy Church and State, and revert to medieval despotism. To accomplish this their leaders had raised and trained a generation for human slaughter. Mankind was to lose everything it had gained through seventy cen- turies of human progress. Every race, nationality, and creed was to be subjected to a paganistic system of slavery. The rights.^ “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” were to be abolished.Mlie world was to be ruled by a “master race” which declared that morality, mercy, humanity, were weaknesses not to be tolerated by the “new order,J^ The direct roots of this gigantic conspiracy lie deeply planted in Victory of Vnited Nations 5 the age-old war system with its centuries of conquest. During the last three thousand years there has been a war in some part of the world twelve out of every thirteen years. VXhe League of Nations, magnificent in its conception, the first organized effort to protect nations against future wars, was deprived of power to enforce its edicts.^, A deliberative body, it advised, suggested, and applied economic sanctions, without ^ing given the means to apply them, if necessary, by united action.|lt functioned successfully in more than a thousand disputes, but found itself without “police power” in the last crucial tes^h The Treaty of Versailles h^ been criticized as both too severe and too lenient — events have proved that it was too lenient. It failed to recognize the psychology of Europe which for three hundred years has been a “breeding ground” for war. In its compromises, with its diplomatic exchanges, it placed too great faith in the pledges of the war-mongers. It failed to lock the doors of opportunity through which the Hitlers and Mussolinis ^d Tojos of the world were later to step. It failed to comprehend the greed and avarice of then' imbued with the ambi- tion for world conquest. Provisions, which constricted them for a time, were not vigorously enforced. It placed too great stress on economic reconstruction and restoration of trade, without taking into considera- tion the elements in human nature which plot and conspire against the world’s peace. With this encouragement, sinister forces in Germany, Italy, and Japan, believing that the United States would not engage in disturb- ^ces outside our own borders, began to defy the League of Nations, f On September 18, Japan ,?ent np die first “trial balloon” to t^ the reactions of the united 'States and the rest of the world. This was the famous “Mukden Incident” when Japan felt her way into Manchuria. The South Manchurian Railway track five miles north of Shenyang was blown up. The Japanese declared that Chinese soldiers were responsible — and on this pretext Japan took possession. When the world’s reactions proved to be nothing more than words — diplo- matic notes, statements, resolutions of protest — ^Japan, Germany, and Italy were convinced the road to world conquest was clear. Four months later Japanese Marines landed at Chapei in Shanghai, setting off the flames that were to sweep China. Then Italy dared to invade Ethiopia — and in quick succession followed the Saar “plebiscite” — ^the Franco Revolution in Spain — ^Hitler’s defiance of the Versailles Treaty, Locarno Pact, and League of Nations by reoccupation of the Rhineland— annexation of Austria by Germany— seizure of Albania by Mussolini— and the other steps leading through the Sudetenland and Munich to the invaaon of Poland on September i, 1939. The “day 6 History of World War 11 of infamy” at Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, was a logical climax to the alleged bombing of a railroad in Mukden ten years before. Students of World War II, and especially servicemen and their families, will find the issues for which they fought consistently stated and re-stated in President Roosevelt’s messages to Congress and his frequent reports to the nation. He never equivocated; he never deviated from the cardinal principles of justice and humanity. These moral and spiritual appeals stand as memorial documents in striking contrast Jo the paganistic and sadistic proclamations of Germany and Japan. ^It is the voice of civilization versus barbarism. In his address to Con- gress on January 6, 1941, he set forth the cause of the democracies in these immortal words; “In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward for a world founded upon the four essential human freedoms: “The first is freedom of speech and expression — everywhere in the world. “The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way — everywhere in the world. ■ “The third is freedom from want — ^which, translated into world terms, means economic imderstandings which will secure to every na- tion a healthy, peaceful life for its inhabitants — everywhere in the world. “The fourth is freedom from fear — ^which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of aggression against any neighbor — ^anywhere in the world.” This clarion call resotmdeci through the world. It became the mod- ern “Sermon on the Mount’^o the distressed peoples and nations of the earth, the soul expressionmf the hopes and ambitions of the human race which proclaimed Roosevelt as the “hope of humanity.” His fundamental principles were the motivating forces behmd every edict and action of the Allies throughout the war. They were the spiritual power behind every war conference leading to the establish- ment of the United Nations of the World organized in San Francisco to provide ways and measures to save the human race from the causes which create wars. The first of these history-making conferences was held “somewhere in the Atlantic” early in August, 1941. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill were the architects of the future when they issued a joint declaration of the peace aims of the United States and Great Britain — ^the Atlantic Charter. This was a mutual expression of the principles involved rather than an official document for preservation in Government archives. Their purpose was to establish a moral un- Victory of United Nations 7 derstanding between the democracies o£ the Anglo-Saxon world in contravention to the unmoral and medieval promulgations of the to- talitarian nations -who were engaged in loot and plunder. The Atlantic Charter was the first direct reply to German attacks on shipping and the submarine warfare being conducted against the freedom of transportation of American products. This “War in the Atlantic” began more than two years before the United States was drawn into the conflict and was a brazen warning of Hitler’s plans while he was organizing the Axis assaults on the civilized world. The Charter, announced from Washington on August 14, 1941, stated: \\“The President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world. “First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other; “Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; “Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live, and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them; “Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all states, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity; “Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic adjustment, and social security; “Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want; “Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance; “Eighth, they beheve that all the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea, or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general 8 History of World War 11 security, that the disarmament of such, nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.” Franklin D. Roosevelt Winston S. Churchill These high concepts of social justice and unity of purpose com- manded the immediate attention of the world. They gave to ihe nations not only a new Declaration of Independence, but the first great Decla- ration of Interdependence, a structural plan for collective security. Less than five months later this inspired conception began to take form. On January 2, 1942-— twenty-six days after the consummation of the Axis plot which stabbed the United States into the war at Pearl Harbor— all the twenty-six countries then at war with one or more of the Axis partners entered into ctmcerted action by signing at Wash- ington a pledge bearing the title? fSeclaration of the United Nations. This document, the first practical result of the Four Freedoms and the Atlantic Charter, formulated the plan which was eventually to win the war and later to organize the brotherhood of nations to pro- tect the world from future wars. One year later, on January 24, 1943, the ten-day Casablanca Con- ference in North Africa — ^where General Eisenhower was commanding the forces against the Axis — set in operation the first United Nations offensive which was to lead to “unconditional surrender” of the Axis Powers. While decisive blows were being struck on the battlefronts the architects of the future drew the blueprints for the winning of the war, the re-creation of Europe, the rehabilitation of Asia, and world reconstruction. The guideposts were set up at the First Quebec Conference in Canada where the whole field of world operations was surveyed on August 11-24, 1943. In the Moscow Conference in Russia from October 19-30, 1943, the Foreign Secretaries of the United States and Great Britain established the relationship with the Soviet Union “essential to their own national interests and in the interest of all peace-loving nations to continue ^lose collaboration in the solution of world problems.” Then came the Cairo Conference in Egypt, on November 22-26, 1943, where President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to agree upon the future military operations against Japan. They resolved to bring “unrelenting pressure against their brutal enemies, ” to “strip Ja pa n of all^the islands in the Pa dfic which she had seized or <)ccma^^o^‘ex^\"t^^^ all tjhe territories vt ^ M d h she has taken by violence and ^eed” apd to restore ^e \"S.epubiic of China. Victory of United Nations 9 The first meeting of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Church- ill with_Premier Stalin of the Soviet Union took place at the Teheran Conference in Iran (ancient Persia), November 26'December 2, 1943. Here thes_e_three great leaders “shaped and confirmed our common policy,” with, “determination that our nations shall work together in the war and in the peace that will follow.” The statesmen of the three nations signed a pact of cooperation which includes these pledges: “The common understanding which we have here reached guaran- tees that victory will be ours.... We recognize fully the supreme re- sponsibility resting upon us and all the United Nations to make a peace which will command good will from the overwhelming masses of the peoples of the world and banish the scourge and terror of war for many generations. . ..We shall seek the cooperation and active participation of all nations, large and small, whose peoples in heart and in mind are dedicated, as are our own peoples, to the elimination of tyranny and slavery, oppression, and intolerance. ... We look with confidence to the day when all the peoples of the world may live free lives untouched by tyranny and according to their varying desires and their own consciences.” This same spirit and purpose was aflSrmed at the Second Quebec Conference in Canada, on September 11-16, 1944, when President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill reached decisions to crush tyranny by speeding the defeat of Germany and Japan. Plans were made “for as far ahead as any men could see with thiugs changing as rapidly in the world as they are today.” The conference was con- ducted in a blaze of friendship. In the blood and travail of the battlefields the outlines of a rainbow of hope could be discerned spanning the earth. A New Age was in the making. Out of the thunder and flame of war, the day of resur- rection was dawning. On October 9, 1944 — seven months before the end of the war — ^four ^eat nations, the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and China, gathered in Washington, and after seven weeks discussions announced the momentous decision of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference to recom- mend “the creation of an international security organization to be known as the United Nations.” ) The purpose of this world body was to stop future wars instantly at their point of inception with the authority for forcing peace and making future aggressions impossible. It was proposed to set up a General Assembly of all peace-loving nations which would make recommendations for maintaining world peace and security, a Security Council, and an Economic and Social Council of eighteen nations to seek “solutions of international economic, social, and other humani- :io History of World War 11 tarian problems and promote respect for human rights and funda- mental freedoms.” The last of the great conferences between President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Premier Stalin was held on Russian soil at Yalta, on February 4-11, 1945, while the war was drawing rapidly to its close. Here the death strokes against the tottering Axis were planned, with the specified duties of each nation in Europe after the fall of the Axis xxntil the various countries could establish self-govern- ment on democratic principles which would guarantee their own security and the preservation of peace. The life work of President Roosevelt was nearing its consummation — ^the “greatest idea in history” for which he labored throughout the war. To establish some plan whereby the age-old system of war could be abolished from tlie earth, he ordained that a United Nations Con- ference be called in San Francisco beginning April 25, 1945. The goal of this Conference would be to perfect international organization and formulate a charter which would guarantee the collective security of the nations of the world. Avoiding the weaknesses of the League of Nations following World War I, he warned that the United Nations Charter at the end of World War II must be invested with power to enforce its edicts, to take such immediate force as necessary against future aggressors before rather than after they had made war. The denial of this power to the old League of Nations was the cause of its failure. The inscrutable processes of history, the destiny of mankind, were in spiritual evolution in the midst of revolution. Out of the carnage could be seen evolving the shape of things to come. President Roosevelt, his faith strong in God and man, envisioned the future for which he was giving his life. The burdens of humanity had weighed heavily on his shoulders. Seeking a few days of rest he left Washington to relax in the countryside he loved at Warm Springs, Georgia. At 5:49 on the afternoon of Thursday, April 12, 1945, the world was startled by words which began to flash over the radios: \"‘Presi- dent Roosevelt is dead!’ While renewing his strength in the peaceful hills preparatory to the arduous duties of the San Francisco Conference, he had slipped quietly into eternity and immortality. The end came during the after- noon, as he sat in his chair talking with his friends, with the sudden stroke of a cerebral hemorrhage. On the desk in his room lay the manuscript he had written the night before — ^the words he had intended to broadcast to the nation as a Jefferson Day address, Friday, the day following his death. As we read the message we find these stirring sentences: “Today, this nation, Victory of United Nations ii which Jefferson helped so gready to build, is playing a tremendous part in the batde for the rights of man all over the world. . . . “We are part of the vast Allied force — a force composed of flesh and blood and steel and spirit — ^which is today destroying the makers of war, the breeders of hate, in Europe and in Asia. . . . “We seek peace — enduring peace. More than an end to war, we want an end to the beginnings of all wars — ^yes, an end to this brutal, in- human, and thoroughly impractical method of settling the differences between governments by the mass killings of peoples. . . . “The mere conquest of our enemies is not enough. We must go on to do all in our power to conquer the doubts and fears, the ignorance and the greed, which made this horror possible.... “Today as we move against the terrible scourge of war — as we go forward toward the greatest contribution that any generation of human beings can make in this world — the contribution of lasting peace — ask you to keep up your faith. . . . “To you, and to all Americans who dedicate themselves with us to the making of an abiding peace, I say: The only limit to our realiza- tion of tomorrouf will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith/* The great leader of humanity was gone, but the inspiration of his words and deeds lives on. Never has a man received higher tributes than those which came like a mighty flood from all parts of the world. Memorials over the radio and in the press placed him among the great men of all time. He was proclaimed “a citizen of the world”; “a valiant soldier who had died in battle”; “a brother of mankind”; “a man with great love for the people”; “the savior of humanity.” His position in history was immediately established. The body of the Commander in Chief was carried through the streets of Washington to the White House on a black army caisson, drawn by six white horses with a seventh for a guide, along the route of his former inaugural processions. Hundreds of thousands lined the way. Many wept. Soldiers and sailors and women in the uniforms of the armed forces “marched in slow, measured cadence ahead of the flag-draped catafalque as service bands played the dirge of a Com- mander in Chief fallen in war.” Franklin Delano Roosevelt lies in the flower garden — ^back home in the village of Hyde Park, Ne\\^ Yqrk, on the banks of the Hudson River. He, like Lincoln, “belongs to the ages.” Lincoln gave his life for the emancipation of three million slaves; Roosevelt gave his life for the emancipation of two billion human beings from the age-old scotirge of war. When Vice President Harry S. Truman took the oath of office as President of the United States, he pledged himself to carry on the 12 History of World War 11 mission of bis fallen friend, and issued orders that the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco be held as Roosevelt had planned — ^it must “go forward.” It was at this assembly that the representatives of fifty nations, after eight weeks of continuous discussions, signed on June 25, 1945, the Charter of the United Nations to preserve world peace through collective security. This charter was later confirmed by the United States Senate and the Governments of the signatory world powers. Its structure and functions in stopping future military aggressions, and in building solid foundations for economic security of all law- abiding nations, avoided the pitfalls of the League of Nations. It established a strong international organization with power to take action by force, if need be, to stop future wars before they can flame into conflagrations. This was the first pracical result of World War II — ^the dream of the ages come true. Twenty-two days after organization of the United Nations in San Francisco, President Truman sat with Prime Minister Churchill and Premier Stalin in Berlin, the fallen capital of the conquered enemy of human freedom. This was the first meeting of the three great nations since the surrender of Germany. Symbolically it was held in Potsdam, the figurative birthplace of Prussian militarism, where from July 17 to August 2, 1945, was written the Potsdam Declaration which doomed the war-making nations. Here, in the almost fabulous Cecilienhof Palace of the late Kaiser’s days of splendor, the democracies issued their proclamation which pronounced retributive penalties against tyrarmy, despotism, and aggression. American, British, and Russian flags draped the huge oak-paneled chamber, symbols of the birth of a new epoch. Around the table, reminiscent of the elegance and luxury of a prof- ligate age, sat the leaders of the United Nations with their official staffs. President Truman presiding. Telephones and radio connected them with every point in the world, providing instantaneous com- munication with every nation and people of the earth. Here they delivered a final ultimatum to the Japanese Government to surrender or be crushed. Here they pronounced the fate of Germany, and set the plans for the future of Europe and the world. At 10:30 A.M., on August 2, 1945, the Potsdam Conference came to its formal close. In Washington, London, and Moscow, the epoch- making document that recorded the results of the deliberations was broadcast. The first section of the 7,000-word document dealt with world peace. A council of foreign ministers of the “Big Three” with China and France was empowered to “continue the necessary prepara- tory work for the peace settlements,” with the belligerent countries of the fallen Axis. The remainder of the decisions was devoted largely Victory of United Nations 13 to Germany, with, provisional agreements on territorial re-adjustments and reparations terms. The section dealing with Germany took proper note of the fact that the German people were equally guilty with their leaders. It made it plain that ihe Allies intended neither to destroy nor to enslave the German people, but rather to rehabilitate them and make them fit to exist in modern civilization. The basic aims were the disarma- ment and denulitarizatiQn of. Germany and her industries, the abolition of all her jnilitary, quasi-military, and political forces that existed up to the time of her surrender. War criminals were to be arrested and tried, including political and military figures. All highly placed Nazis and sympathizers were to be interned, and no Nazi was to be left in a responsible position, public or private. Education was to be controlled to eliminate Nazism. The judicial' system was included in similar plans. Decentralization was emphasized in the political future of Germany and for the time being the establishment of a central German Government was forbidden, while democracy was to guide local self-government. The basic free- doms of speech, religion, and the press were to be permitted within the limits of military security, and free trade unions were allowed. It was declared that the United Nations would accept applications from all “peace-loving states who accept the obligations contained in the present Charter, and, in the judgment of the organization, were al^le and willing to carry out these obligations.” (Human consciousness and conscience, as a result of World War II, ha^e been awakened to a realization that only through some plan of world cooperation, endowed with power to stop war at its point of inception, can future catastrophies be averted,*^ The end of this first chapter of World War II seems a fitting place to include a message that has been sent to the historian by General Dwight D. Eisenhower from his Headquarters in Europe; “The United Nations have been engaged in a great war for freedom. The military conflict has been won and there now remains the neces- sity of developing the victory into a secure, peaceful, and prosperous future. “During the war the sons and daughters of free nations have dem- onstrated a capacity for sacrifice of self and for uniting in a common cause that can now be turned into the more fruitful task that lies ahead. My faith and my belief in the democratic peoples of the world leave no doubt in my mind as to ultimate success.” 2 LAST DAYS OF WORLD’S GREATEST WAR -NEW AGE OF THE ATOMIC BOMB H OW civilization on the brink of the abyss of war was saved by the indomitable will and superhuman courage of men, with the power of science, inventive genius, and industry behind them, is the greatest story in the annals of mankind. The fourth decade of the twentieth century surpasses in its astounding revelations any other period in history, and it marked the end of a war far more devastating than the human mind was hitherto able to conceive. In these pages we shall survey the world’s first great war in the air through the developments of the aeronautical sciences, the first great mechanized war on land and sea, the first war with implements of modern industry, the first war conducted by vast organization and engineering directed by the science of radio. It was a war in which time and space were eliminated to such an extent that they were mas- tered by men — a war that proved to be the beginning of an era of marvels in w'hich radar and atomic energy made their first appearance on the human stage. Mighty forces were released whose utility in times of peace, having first served as powers of destruction, can revolutionize life on this earth and help solve’ many of the economic, social, and political prob- lems of the future. These, with awakened spiritual conceptions, under the guidance of the United Nations, give men and nations the oppor- tunity to create a new civilization rising out of the ashes of World War II.|lf, through greed and avarice, man fails to take advantage of these opportunities, he will sign his own death warrant and perish through the power of his own inventive geniusX As historians, it is our duty to portray the bloodshed which led to this new epoch, the battles in which millions of men fought and died, or survived to come home to take leadership in the creation of this new world. We advise our readers to study the time-table of events which appears in the Chronology at the end of this book, as it is impossible within the scope of our narrative to present more than the highlights. The greatest moment in any war is the moment it ends. Therefore we are presenting the last days of World War II before discussing the start of the war and the long train of events which followed in rapid succession until it reached its climax. Inasmuch as the fall of the Axis in Europe on May 7, 1945, is 14 Last Days of War 15 described In tEe closing chapters, we take you to the Pacific to witness the final scenes of the world conflict — ^the last battles in the Far East where the war ended. After the celebrations of V-E day (Victory in Europe) and the triumph of the Allies, the world’s attention was directed toward Japan. It was estimated that it would require one more year and possibly 4,000,000 men to bring the cataclysmic struggle to its conclusion. How this schedule was reduced to a few weeks is here related. Japan was fighting desperately alone as the last of the Axis in these final weeks. In one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war the tide in Burma, which had been turned at Imphal, Kohima, and Myitkyina, surged over that country of towering mountains and abysmal jungles until the Japanese were driven from Mandalay, Akyab, Rangoon, and all the rest of the stolen territory except a corridor along the Sittang River which provided a tenuous escape route into Thailand. The enemy fought with everything he possessed, but later engaged in a series of wide withdrawals behind the screen of desperate suicide rear-guards. The entire Japanese Army in Burma, with the exception of scattered elements, was wiped out. In China, the Japanese had achieved for a brief moment their long objective of gaining full possession of the Canton-Hankow Railway and other main lines, cutting Free China off from its coastal provinces. The campaign captured eleven bases of the United States Fourteenth Air Force, depriving the Americans of every forward field other than a few isolated, hidden emergency fields, and pushing them back hun- dreds of miles to Kunming. Generalissimo Chiang’s troops, in a sudden resurgence, were bolstered by the Sixth A»my that had driven into Burma through the Salween Valley. The United States Tenth Air Force, shifted to China from Burma, unleashed powerful attacks in the late spring of 1945 that reopened long stretches of the railways and culminated in the liberation of hundreds of miles of the country’s coastline within two hours’ flight from Okinawa. In China, as in Burma, the Japanese began a series of retreats, clinging desperately to certain areas to prevent a rout. At sea the Fifth and Third Fleets, subsequently revealed to have been one and the same thing under different names to confuse the enemy, closed in on the main islands of Japan. Under Admiral Halsey it was the Third Fleet, under Admiral Spruance it was the Fifth with only a few changes in composition. Week after week it sailed deep into enemy waters, launching as many as 1,400 planes from its carrier decks against Tokyo, Kobe, Kure, the Inland Sea, and a host of other targets. The maia objective of Ae fleet’s bombers was to keep the enemy air force pinned to the ground and destroy as much in the way of installations and war potential as possible. During June and July they caught the remnants of the Japanese 1 6 History of World War 11 Fleet hiding in the Inland Sea and at the Yokosuka naval base below Tokyo and virtually wiped out what was left of the world’s third largest navy. Battleships and other surface units pumped thousands of tons of shells into coastal cities virtually widiout opposition from shore batteries or from the air. When Admiral Halsey again took over the naval forces, on May 28, Japan was free of Third Fleet attacks only at rare intervals. Despite raging typhoons 105 American warships and twenty-eight British com- bat vessels under Admiral Fraser, attached to the Third Fleet, drew ihe net tighter. By the middle of August this armada, headed by nine battleships including the new Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, and the British King George V, twenty carriers, and twenty-five cruisers, shot down 290 enemy planes in combat, destroyed 1,301 on the ground, and damaged 1,374 more. Forty-eight enemy warships from battle- ships down were sunk, 100 more were battered and 1,500 merchantmen were sunk or damaged. In the last thirty-seven days of operations the only Third Fleet damage was to one light surface unit. By the second week in August Japan’s naval war loss totaled twelve battleships, nineteen carriers, thirty-six cruisers, 126 destroyers, and 125 submarines. Only a dozen destroyers and nine coast defense vessels were left in good enough condition to be able to take to sea duty within ten days. Submarines, under Vice Admiral Charles A. Lock- wood, Jr., had played a big part in this destruction. Since Pearl Harbor they had definitely sunk warships and 1,089 transports, tankers, and merchantmen, with hundreds more probably sunk or damaged. Japan’s pre-war merchant fleet of 7,000,000 tons had been cut to less than 1,500,000. <■ In the air the United States dealt the most crippling blows against the enemy, with the giant B-ap’s leading the way. Capture of Iwo and Okinawa made it possible to provide the Superfortresses with escort craft. Okinawa was quickly being converted mto a base large enough to keep the B-ap’s on Japan’s doorstep. When the war in Europe ended. Lieutenant General Doolittle was sent to Okinawa with his Eighth Air Force to spearhead the final pre-invasion assault and continue the job he had begun from “Shangri-la.” General Carl A. Spaatz, who had directed the strategic bombing of Germany, was placed in command of the new Strategic Air Forces built around the B-ap’s and also sent to the Pacific. General Arnold told the Japanese that the country would be hit with bombs at the rate of 2,000,000 tons a year. The B-29 ’s had increased so vastly in number and power that the original flight of eleven planes carrying scarcely 100 tons of bombs grew to a mission of 820 Superfortresses which, on August 6, dropped 6,600 tons of demolition and fire-bombs on a series of targets. From Last Days of War 17 November 24, 1944, to August 14-15, 1945, the Superfortresses had flown some 325 missions involving 32,612 individual sorties, totaling a dis- tance of more than 100,000,000 miles during which 169,421 tons of bombs were dropped on 581 important factories, six major arsenals, 102 airfields, and other targets in sixty-four industrial areas with a com- bined pppulation of nearly 25,000,000. In addition, mines had been laid in forty-five stretches of enemy home waters, completely ringing Japan and isolating her from the rest of the world. In all these opera- tions 437 B-29 ’s and 297 crew members were lost; over 600 of the men were rescued from the sea. The rapidly approaching end of the aerial war was evident when the B-29 ’s came in low to drop the neyy, gelatin fire-bombs which defied all man-made fire breaks. Tokyo was the tar^t. Conflagrations raged up to the high embankments surroimdmg'^mperor Hirohito’s palace. The incendiary attack was so successful that from then on most of the aerial assaults were of this type. General Kenney’s fliers, from the time he took over at the gates of Australia in the middle of 1942 until his Far East Air Forces began to operate from Okinawa, had destroyed 11,900 enemy planes and probably destroyed 4,676 more. They also had sunk 1,700,000 tons of shipping and damaged 3,000,000 more. The Fifth Air Force which had been the core of the climb up the Pacific was subsequently joined by the Thirteenth, which had been based in the Solomons, and in June by the Seventh, which, in fightng westward from Pearl Harbor to Okinawa, had covered 16,000,000 square miles of the Pacific. ^Three devastating blows in four days struck Japan during the first ■v^k of August. These blows, with the atomic bombs to follow, quickly drove Japan out of the war and brought World War II to its sudden and completely victorious close. On August 6 “the force from which the sun draws its pow^s” was “loosed against those who brought the war to the Far Easy The words are those of President Truman who, in a dramatic state- ment issued aboard the cruiser Augusta, on which he was returning home from the Potsdam Conference, announced that the world’s first atomic bomb had been dropped from an American B-29 upo n the Japanese city and army base of Hiroshima on the Inland Sea. ‘The 350,000 residents of that city had rushed to air raid shelters shortly before nine o’clock on that Monday morning when two B-ap’s appeared overhead. The big planes circled Hiroshima two or three times and then moved away. The “all-clear” sounded. The Japanese did not know that those two planes were checking the weather, visibility, wind, etc., for a third B-29, which came over as the people began to go about their usual business. At 9:15 a parachute dropped from the bomb bay. At its end was 1 8 History of 'World War II a bomb-casing containing a small explosive charge. When the para- chute was about 1,500 feet from the ground, it seemed as if the world had suddenly come to an end. A tremendous flash, like a ball of fire, illuminated everything for scores of miles; it was visible from the air 170 miles away. Then a funnel of smoke, dust, fire, and color mounted like a waterspout up, up, up ever higher until the pillar of boiling dust had reached the stratosphere. In two minutes the head was 40,000 feet above the ground and was still rising. It took hours for the air to clear sufficiently to see what had happened. In a split second 60 per cent of Hiroshima had been wiped off the map. The new weapon was the atomic bomb, which harnessed the basic power of the universe. It obliterated buildings, trees, and every- thing else within a wide range. One tenth of Hiroshima’s population was killed instantly, as m^ny more died of their injuries, and more than 30,000 just disappeared. Colonel Paul W, Tibbets, Jr., of Miami, Florida, piloted the 'Enola Gay, which dropped the Uomb. With him was Captain William S. Parsons, U.S.N., of Chicago, who had designed the bomb. Captain Parsons made it possible to drop the tiny device containing the atom- splitting miracle by adding a casing to give it weight, a timing ap- paratus to make it begin functioning at the proper height, and the essential military apparatus for the release of the destructive energy — an explosive force equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT which would have required 2,000 Superfortresses to carry. The man who released the first atomic bomb was Major Thomas W. Ferebee, of Mocksville, N. C. The co-pilot was Captain Robert A. Lewis, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, the navigator Captain Theodore J. Van Kirk, North Cumberland, Pennsylvania. The other members of that epoch-making crew were: Staff Sergeant Wyatt E. Duzenbury, Lansing, Michigan, flight engineer; Pfc. Richard N. Nelson, Los Angeles, California, radio operator; Sergeant Joe A. Steiborik, Taylor, Texas, radar operator; Staff Sergeant George R. Ceron, Lynbrook, Long Island, tail gunner, and Lieutenant M. U. Jeppson, electronics officer. President Truman characterized the development of the atomic bomb as “tfie battl e of the l aboratories.” a battle just barely won over Germany by tKelieroic efforts of Allied fighting men which retarded enemy progress on the one hand while hastening military defeat on the other. It was, also won by the superhuman efforts of scientists. The first real progress came when President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill agreed to pool the knowledge of Great Britain and the United States on the development of this scientific marvel. |Experimental work was begun in 1940 in the United States. What transpired after that and until August 6, 1945 was the world’s Last Days of War 19 best kept secret, despite the fact that at one time 125,000 persons were engaged in extracting the uranium element and producing the other essentials for the attainment of what scientists call “atomic fission” that releases the almost limitless energy. Three hidden cities with a total population of 100,000 sprang into being to produce the atomic bomb. One was at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It rose from an area of oaks, pines, and small farms to become the state’s fifth largest city. It was operated under the name “Manhattan Engineer District,” and was also known as the Clinton Engineer Works. A second town was isolated in the New Mexico mesa near Santa Fe, where experimental work was carried on and near which the first bomb constructed was exploded to observe the results. Richland Village, or the Hanford Engineers Works, was constructed near Pasco, Washingtonl^Hundreds of the nation’s leading scientific and industrial cpncerns contributed vital parts to the entire project. ] It was the scientists of the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, who made the bomb possible. President Roosevelt, in 1941, created a special group in the Ofl&ce of Scientific Research and Development to supervise the delicate task, with Dr. Vannevar Bush m direct charge. Vice President Wallace, Secretary of War Stimson, General Marshall, and President James B. Conant of Harvard constituted, with Dr. Bush, a General Policy Group. Major General Leslie R. Groves, of Albany, New York, was placed in executive charge of the program. Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, of the University of California, was director of the New Mexico laboratory where the first atomic bomb was ex- ploded on July 16, only three weeks before it went into actual use at Hiroshima. Colonel Franklin T. Matthias headed the Washington project, and Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols the Tennessee work. Briga- dier General Thomas F. Farrell was first assistant to General Groves. Dr. Richard C. Tolman of the California Institute of Technology was the scientific adviser, and Dr. Conant served as counselor. The undertaking was a joint Anglo-American project and Great Britain was fully represented in all stages. Field Marshal Sir John Dill, Colonel J. J. Llewellin, Sir Ronald I. Campbell, the Earl of Halifax, Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson represented the Umted Kingdom, and C. D. Howe represented Canada on the cornbined policy committee. Sir James Chadwick and Dean C. J. Mackenzie were scientific advisers. Hundreds of physicists participated in the work, including Dr. A. H. Compton, Prof. Harold Urey, Dr. Neils Bohr, Prof. Ernest Lawrence, Dr. Enrico Fermi, and Dr. Lise Meitner, the latter a refugee from Nazi Germany. President Truman’s announcement of the atomic bomb produced an effect upon Japan’s rulers equal to the shock suffered by the people of Hiroshima. 20 History of World War 11 “The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor,” he said. “They have been repaid many fold. And the end is nor yet. We are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications. Let there be no mistake; we shall completely destroy Japan’s power to r^ke war. I'lt was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum. If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already aware.” As if to implement his words the second atomic bomb fell on Naga- saki, Japan, three days later. It was an improved version of the first. While it did not destroy as great an area as the 4.1 square miles of Hiroshima, the devastation was more complete and final. The buildings of Nagasaki were devastated. In the center of the area where, accord- ing to witnesses, a vacuum was created, there was no sign of any buildings whatsoever. Everything had vanished. Of Nagasaki’s 50,000 buildings 18,000 were destroyed and few of the others escaped damage. Nearly 30,000 persons were killed. Among them were eight Allied prisoners of war who had been among those interned in a prison camp located in the heart of the great Mitsubishi arms plant, contrary to all international rules. Great Britain and the United States had reluctantly unleashed the atomic bomb against Japan. The decision was reached only when it became evident that the war would be shortened and tens of thou- sands of American lives would be saved. Behind these new bombs was to come a giant invasion of Kyushu and Honshu in the late months of 1945 and early months of 1946. Japan, it was discovered, had an army of 7,000,000 men, nearly double the highest estiiiiates, of which 3,000,000 were on the home islands. More were being with- drawn from the continent. The enemy also had from 6,000 to 9,000 planes he was hoarding to use against the invasion, explaining the lack of opposition encountered by the Allied bombers and warships. These planes the Japanese in- tended to hurl in suicide attacks against the troopships and covering vessels. They planned to inflict so much damage that the American troops would be insufiEcient in number and equipment to cope with the islands’ defenders. That there was some justification to this hope was evidenced by the fact that more than 250 American ships had been hit by the Kamikaze squads during the Okinawa campaign. 21 Last Days of War More than ttiirt}' American ships were sunk, with casualties of 10,000 killed, missing, and wounded. It was Japanese lives against Allied lives that cast the die in favor of using the atomic bomb against Japan. The British and’ Americans were so fearful of future developments that they decided to entrust its secret to a special commission that would study ways in which the illimitable energy might be converted to constructive purposes for the good of ma nkin d. Then came another shock to Japan. Between the Hiroshima and , Nagasaki blows Russia entered the Pacific war, fulfilling her promise at Yalta to join the United Nations against Japan after the defeat of Germany. President Truman, at Potsdam, had won one of his greatest victories in persuading Premier Stalin to enter the conflict at once. On August 8, 1945, Foreign Commissar Molotov handed Japanese Ambassador Sato in Moscow a note stating that Russia was joining the other Allied Powers in the war against Japan and that from August 9, 1945 “the Soviet Government will consider itself to be at war with Japan.” Promptly on the morning of August 9 the Red Army swept into Manchuria against Japan’s vaunted Kwantung Army. Included also in the Russian note was the first intimation to the world that the Japanese had broached the subject of peace. Rumors had been numerous but remained unconfirmed or denied. In view of Tokyo’s subsequent attempts to attribute Japan’s defeat to the atomic bomb, Moscow’s disclosure proved that the enemy had realized he was de- feated long before Hiroshima. Premier Stalin rejected Japan’s first proposal on the ground that it was too general to submit. Then Tokyo wanted to send a delegation to Europe during the Potsdam Conference, but before this could be settled the ultimatum of July 26 was issued and it was too late. The Red Army started to move at 12:10 a.m. on August 9 — ^nine minutes after the declaration of war had become effective. One attack was launched on Manchuria’s northeast border, the other on the west, where Outer Mongolia and Manchuria join. Korea was invaded the next day. In rapid strides of eighty, ninety, and more than one hun- dred miles a day the Russians, under supreme command of Marshal Alexander M. Vasilevsky, former Chief of Staff of the Red Army, closed in on Harbin in their typical “pincers” style that had beaten Germany’s best troops. Rashin, Japanese naval base in Korea and the nearby port of Yuki were quickly capmred by the Soviet Pacific Fleet of Admiral Ivan Yumasheff. General Oto Yamada’s Kwantung Army was no more able to stop the Russians than the Germans had been. zz History of World War 11 Things started to break with incredible rapidity and bewildering contradiction. On Friday, August lO, the Tokyo radio broadcast that Japan was ready to surrender if the Emperor’s “prerogatives” were not prejudiced. The next day the United States, on behalf of the Allies, replied that the Emperor and his Government would be subject to the direction of the Allied Supreme Commander. The following day there was a false radio flash that the Japanese had agreed. Following more days of contradictory reports, blended with abysmal silence from Tokyo, word finally reached the White House early in the evening of Tuesday, August 14, that the terms had been accepted. The incredible delays stirred fears of Japanese treachery. While the pace of fighting was slowed, combat conditions were maintained everywhere. The Japanese Domei news agency broadcast of August 10 that star- tled the world read: “Demarche First: Japanese Government today addressed following communications to Swiss and Swedish Govern- ments, respectively, for transmission to the United States, Great Britain, China, and Soviet Union: “In obedience to the gracious command of His Majesty the Emperor, who, ever anxious to enhance the cause of world peace, desires earnestly to bring about an early termination of hostilities with a view to saving mankind from the calamities to be imposed upon them by further continuation of the war, the Japanese Government asked several weeks ago the Soviet Government, with which neutral relations then prevailed, to render good oflSce in restoring peace vis-a-vis the enemy powers. Unfortunately these efforts in the ihterest of peace having failed, the Japanese Government, in conformity with the august wish of His Majesty to restore the general peace and desiring to put an end to the untold sufferings entailed by war as quickly as possible, have decided upon the following: “The Japanese Government are ready to accept the terms enumerated in the joint declaration which was issued at Potsdam on July 26, 1945, by the heads of the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, and China, and later subscribed to by the Soviet Government, with the understanding that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler. The Japanese Government hopes sincerely that” — and here the Tokyo radio went off the air for several hours. A later broadcast com- pleted the sentence as follows — “this understanding is warranted and desire keenly that an explicit indication to that effect will be speedily forthcoming.” The wording of the note carried an additional significance in that it presented the Emperor as a peace-loving man and, by implication, denied responsibility for having plunged China and the other nations into war. Last Days of War 23 President Truman immediately conferred with the heads of the other nations. On behalf of the Big Four, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes (who had succeeded Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., when the latter took over the State Department at the time Secretary Hull was forced to relinquish that post because of ill health) dispatched the following answer through ^e Swiss Legation, on the morning of August II : “With regard to the Japanese Government’s message accepting the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation but containing the statement, ‘with the understanding that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sov- ereign ruler,’ our position is as follows: “From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the State sh"
