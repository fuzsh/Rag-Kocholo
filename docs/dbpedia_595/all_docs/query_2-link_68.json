        "text": "Hitler Gives Word In a Proclamation He Accuses Warsaw of Appeal to Arms Foreigners Are Warned They Remain in Poland at Own Risk--Nazis to Shoot at Any Planes Gdynia Blockaded By German Fleet\n\nBy OTTO D. TOLISCHUS\n\nSpecial Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nBerlin, Friday, Sept. 1--Charging that Germany had been attacked, Chancellor Hitler at 5:11 o'clock this morning issued a proclamation to the army declaring that from now on force will be met with force and calling on the armed forces \"to fulfill their duty to the end.\"\n\nThe text of the proclamation reads:\n\nTo the defense forces:\n\nThe Polish nation refused my efforts for a peaceful regulation of neighborly relations; instead it has appealed to weapons.\n\nGermans in Poland are persecuted with a bloody terror and are driven from their homes. The series of border violations, which are unbearable to a great power, prove that the Poles no longer are willing to respect the German frontier. In order to put an end to this frantic activity no other means is left to me now than to meet force with force.\n\n\"Battle for Honor\"\n\nGerman defense forces will carry on the battle for the honor of the living rights of the re- awakened German people with firm determination.\n\nI expect every German soldier, in view of the great tradition of eternal German soldiery, to do his duty until the end.\n\nRemember always in all situations you are the representatives of National Socialist Greater Germany!\n\nLong live our people and our Reich!\n\nBerlin, Sept. 1, 1939.\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\nThe commander-in-chief of the air force issued a decree effective immediately prohibiting the passage of any airplanes over German territory excepting those of the Reich air force or the government.\n\nThis morning the naval authorities ordered all German mercantile ships in the Baltic Sea not to run to Danzig or Polish ports.\n\nAnti-air raid defenses were mobilized throughout the country early this morning.\n\nA formal declaration of war against Poland had not yet been declared up to 8 o'clock [3 A.M. New York time] this morning and the question of whether the two countries are in a state of active belligerency is still open.\n\nReichstag Will Meet Today\n\nForeign correspondents at an official conference at the Reich Press Ministry at 8:30 o'clock [3:30 A.M. New York time] were told that they would receive every opportunity to facilitate the transmission of dispatches. Wireless stations have been instructed to speed up communications and the Ministry is installing additional batteries of telephones.\n\nThe Reichstag has been summoned to meet at 10 o'clock [5 A.M. New York time] to receive a more formal declaration from Herr Hitler.\n\nThe Hitler army order is interpreted as providing, for the time being, armed defense of the German frontiers against aggression. The action is also suspected of forcing international diplomatic action.\n\nThe Germans announced that foreigners remain in Polish territory at their own risk.\n\nFlying over Polish territory as well as the maritime areas is forbidden by the German authorities and any violators will be shot down.\n\nWhen Herr Hitler made his announcement Berlin's streets were still deserted except for the conventional early traffic, and there were no outward signs that the nation was finding itself in the first stages of war.\n\nThe government area was completely deserted, and the two guards doing sentry duty in front of the Chancellery remained their usual mute symbol of authority. It was only when official placards containing the orders to the populace began to appear on the billboards that early workers became aware of the situation.\n\nBorder Clashes Increase\n\nWireless to The New York Times\n\nBerlin, Friday, Sept. 1--An increasing number of border incidents involving shooting and mutual Polish-German casualties are reported by the German press and radio. The most serious is reported from Gleiwitz, a German city on the line where the southwestern portion of Poland meets the Reich.\n\nAt 8 P.M., according to the semi-official news agency, a group of Polish insurrectionists forced an entrance into the Gleiwitz radio station, overpowering the watchmen and beating and generally mishandling the attendants. The Gleiwitz station was relaying a Breslau station's program, which was broken off by the Poles.\n\nThey proceeded to broadcast a prepared proclamation, partly in Polish and partly in German, announcing themselves as \"the Polish Volunteer Corps of Upper Silesia speaking from the Polish station in Gleiwitz.\" The city, they alleged, was in Polish hands.\n\nGleiwitz's surprised radio listeners notified the police, who halted the broadcast and exchanged fire with the insurrectionists, killing one and capturing the rest. The police are said to have discovered that the attackers were assisted by regular Polish troops. The Gleiwitz incident is alleged here to have been the signal \"for a general attack by Polish franctireurs on German territory.\"\n\nTwo other points--Pitsachen, near Kreuzburg, and Hochlinden, northeast of Ratibor, both in the same vicinity as Gleiwitz, were the scenes of violations of the German boundary, it is claimed, with fighting at both places still under way.\n\nBack to the top of this page.\n\nBack to today's page.\n\nGo to another day."
