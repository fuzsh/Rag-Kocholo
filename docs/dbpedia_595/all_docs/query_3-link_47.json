Since history is truly argument without end, this question is somewhat moot, but for purposes of this book I adopt the second premise, since the machines themselves were (and are) the products of men. In other words, I believe that the Luftwaffe lost the war because of human failure, rather than because of technological failure. This is not to say that the technological failure did not occur—quite the opposite. I in no way intend to minimize the contributions of those who study the technological aspects of the air war in Europe; I very much respect and admire them. However, it is my opinion that the human factor was (and is) primary in war—just as war itself, in the larger sense, must be regarded as a human failure. For example, the technical reasons why the British Spitfires and Hurricanes were superior to the Heinkel 111s and Messerschmitt 110s during the Battle of Britain are significant questions, but perhaps a more significant question might be: Why were the German combat pilots still saddled with obsolete He-111s and Me-110s as late as 1940?\n\nThe purpose of this book is to look at the men behind the airplanes, i.e., to examine the fundamental causes of the Luftwaffe’s demise. The war has now been over for more than sixty years. The technology of the 1940s has been relegated to museums for decades, but the causes of the Luftwaffe’s defeat are still with us. One only has to listen to a debate in the American Congress to understand that. If those who do not study the past are indeed condemned to relive it, then this book should serve as a warning to the leaders, strategists, and technicians of today.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFirst and foremost, I wish to thank Mr. Harry R. Fletcher and the staff of the Albert F. Simpson Historical Research Center, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, for all their kind and very professional help.\n\nThanks also go to the staff of the United States National Archives, Washington, D.C., for providing photographs; to Paula Leming, Professor of Foreign Languages at Henderson State University, for help in translating; and to Dr. Claude Sumerlin of H.S.U. for proofreading and advice.

Gratitude is also extended to the staff of Huie Library, H.S.U., and most especially to Mrs. Barbara Roberts, who has for years been plagued by my insatiable demands for interlibrary loans.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Secret Air Force\n\nAlthough it would not officially exist for more than two years, the Luftwaffe can trace its birth to 11 A.M. on January 30, 1933, when Adolf Hitler was sworn in as chancellor of Germany. Later that day he appointed Hermann Goering, the number two man in the Nazi party, as minister without portfolio and Reich commissioner of aviation (Reichskommissariat für die Luftfahrt) in the new government. Actually Goering was minister of aviation and commander-in-chief of the secret German air force. In many ways his personality dominated the Luftwaffe throughout its existence.\n\nHermann Goering, author Matthew Cooper later wrote, was an enigma. He was as much the stuff of which heroes are made as are villains. He was a remarkable combination of contradictions . . . He was both energetic and lazy; realistic and romantic; brutal and kind; brave and cowardly; refined and coarse; intelligent, vain, humourous and ruthless . . . [an] inspiration to some, an object of ridicule and detestation to others.¹\n\nHermann was born in Marienbad Sanitarium at Rosenheim, Bavaria, on January 12, 1893, the fourth son of Heinrich Ernst and Franiszha Fanny Goering. His middle name was Wilhelm, after Kaiser Wilhelm II, whom he was destined to serve in World War I. Hermann grew up in Bavaria. A head-strong and rebellious youth, he was educated at various boarding schools: the Karlsruhe Military Academy and the prestigious Gross-Lichterfelde Cadet Academy near Berlin, where he underwent officer training. He was gazetted Leutnant (second lieutenant) in the Prince Wilhelm (112th Infantry) Regiment at Muelhausen in March 1912.²\n\nWhen World War I broke out in the fall of 1914, young Goering’s regiment was sent to the western front, where he was commended for initiative and daring. He soon fell ill, however, and was recovering in the military hospital at Freiburg when a visit from Lt. Bruno Loerzer changed his entire life.\n\nYoung Loerzer, who had formerly served in the 112th Infantry, had left the Muelhausen regiment to become a pilot trainee at Freiburg and was now scheduled to join an air force unit at Ostend, Belgium. Loerzer’s adventurous tales so excited Hermann Goering that he decided to apply for a transfer and join his friend there as an aerial observer. When the transfer was refused and he was ordered to rejoin his regiment, Goering headed for Ostend anyway—in direct disobedience of orders. Naturally the commander of the Muelhausen regiment demanded his immediate court-martial.\n\nFortunately for Goering, he had friends in high places. His godfather (and his mother’s lover) was Ritter (Knight, or Sir) Hermann von Epenstein, a rich half-Jewish aristocrat who had received his knighthood title from Kaiser Wilhelm II. Ritter von Epenstein used his influence at court to intercede in Hermann’s behalf. The court-martial proceedings were quietly dropped, and he was soon officially transferred to the air service.\n\nFrom the beginning, Hermann Goering proved himself to be an incredibly brave airman. Goering’s belief . . ., Manvill and Fraenkel wrote, was that nothing could happen to harm him. He was, quite literally, insensitive to physical danger.³ As an aerial observer with the 25th Air Detachment during the Battle of Verdun in 1915, Goering and his pilot, Loerzer, both won the Iron Cross, 1st Class, and were personally decorated by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm. In June, Lieutenant Goering returned to Freiburg as a pilot-trainee and in October was posted to the 5th Jagdstaffel (Fighter Squad -ron) as a fighter pilot. Three weeks later, he was shot down by a British Sop-with. Had he not been fortunate enough to crash-land next to a German field hospital, he would have bled to death. Observers later counted sixty bullet holes in his airplane. It took months for his shattered thigh to heal.\n\nGoering spent his convalescent leave at his godfather’s Mauterdorf Castle in the summer of 1916, where he fell in love with Marianne Mauser, the daughter of a local landowner, and proposed marriage to her. Their engagement remained unofficial, however, because of her parents’ objections. Herr Mauser looked upon Goering as a man without any prospects except an early death, and it appeared he was right: Hermann returned to the western front in late 1916.\n\nHis new unit was the 26th Fighter Squadron, which was commanded by Bruno Loerzer and was headquartered at their old regimental station of Muelhausen. Here Goering came into his own. By mid-1917 he had shot down seventeen enemy airplanes and had been named commander of the 27th Fighter Squadron at Yseghem, in the Flanders sector. In recognition of his leadership, Kaiser Wilhelm decorated him with the Pour le Merite after only fifteen victories, instead of the normal twenty-five. Goering had already been awarded the Zaehring Lion with Swords, the Karl Friedrich Order with Swords, and the Hohenzollern House Order with Swords, 3rd Class.⁴\n\nThe leading German ace, of course, was Baron Manfred von Richthofen, the commander of the 1st Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wing), who scored eighty victories. The Red Baron was killed on April 21, 1918, by a lucky machine-gun burst from Roy Brown, an unassuming Canadian ace with a nervous stomach.⁵ Richthofen was replaced as wing leader by Capt. Wilhelm Reinhardt, who was killed in a flying accident on July 3. Most people expected the new commander to be Ernst Udet, a member of the squadron who had over fifty kills and was Germany’s leading surviving air ace. Everyone was surprised when Hermann Goering was given the prestigious command.⁶\n\nGoering (by now a captain) led Jagdgeschwader Richthofen Number 1 very well. Although at first resented by some of the pilots, he soon gained their confidence and made lifelong contacts. Among his subordinates were four of his future generals: Wolfram von Richthofen, a future field marshal and a cousin of the Red Baron; Ernst Udet; and lieutenants Karl Bodenschatz and Kurt von Doering. All except Doering played significant roles in the future Luftwaffe. Goering ran his victory total to twenty-two before the armistice was signed. On Goering’s orders the wing smashed their aircraft at Darmstadt, rather than surrender them intact to the Allies as they had been ordered to do.\n\nIn December, Goering rejoined his mother in Munich. Here his unofficial engagement to Fräulein Mauser quietly came to an end. What have you got now to offer my daughter? Herr Mauser wrote to Hermann.\n\nNothing, the unemployed Goering telegraphed back.⁷ And that was the end of that.\n\nLike many ex-officers, Goering was embittered by the Treaty of Versailles, which the victorious Allies forced Germany to sign. Among other things, the Versailles Dikta (dictate) limited the size of the German Army to 100,000 men (of which 4,000 could be officers) and completely outlawed military aviation and the elite General Staff. The former commander of the Richthofen wing briefly joined the Freikorps in 1919, before leaving war-torn and revolutionary Germany in disgust. He began a career as a barnstormer in Denmark and Sweden. It was here he met and fell in love with Karin von Kantzow (nee von Fock), the beautiful wife of a Swedish army captain. She soon left her husband for Goering, and they lived together for several months before her divorce was secured. They were finally married in Munich on February 3, 1923.\n\nHermann Goering returned to Germany in 1922 and enrolled in the University of Munich as a history and political science student. Here he met the second and last hero of his life. The first had been his half-Jewish godfather; the second was Adolf Hitler, head of the infant Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, also known as the NSDAP or Nazi party).\n\nGoering’s career in the rise of the Nazi party (1922–32) is fascinating, but beyond the scope of this book. One incident is germane, however: on November 9, 1923, during Hitler’s attempt to seize power in Bavaria during the so-called Beer Hall Putsch, Goering took part in the march in Munich and, in front of the Feldennhalle, was shot by the police, who were firing high-velocity 7.9mm slugs. The bullet struck him in the upper right thigh, just inches from the groin. He fell to the pavement and got dirt in the wound, causing further medical problems.⁸ Given morphine to relieve the terrible pain, he soon became a drug addict. He was also never able to control his weight after this.\n\nWhen Goering took office in early 1933, the Treaty of Versailles was still in effect. It had never been scrupulously observed, however. Gen. Hans von Seeckt, the creator of the Reichsheer (as the 100,000-man army was called), had insisted that 180 of the 4,000-man officer corps be chosen from the former air service. Under his tutelage Germany made a covert agreement with the Soviet Union and set up a secret air training base at Lipetsk, Russia. He also set up secret air organizations and an air training office in the Truppen -amt (troop office), as the clandestine General Staff was called, and placed Maj. Helmut Wilberg in charge of it. By the time Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering rose to power, there were a number of undercover aviation squad -rons in Germany. They did not amount to much and would not have lasted a week in a war with a major power, such as France, but they could be used to form the nucleus of an air force and provided a reservoir of trained personnel from which the Luftwaffe could draw.⁹\n\nIn 1933, Hermann Goering held a multitude of offices. In addition to being Reich commissioner of aviation and Hitler’s chief deputy, he was president of the Reichstag and minister of the interior of Prussia, and would soon be prime minister of Prussia, Reich forest master (Reichsforestmeister), Reich game warden (Reichsjaegermeister), and chief plenipotentiary of Hitler’s Four Year (economic) Plan. Hitler was planning to call an election for March 5. Therefore, prior to that, Goering had to purge the Berlin and Prussian police forces of their anti-Nazi elements and replace them with people he could depend on. He had neither the time nor inclination to concern himself with the day-to-day building of the Luftwaffe. This he left to his deputy, the state secretary for aviation.\n\nThe best-qualified man for this post was Helmut Wilberg, at that time a major general. A highly capable and technically proficient General Staff officer, Wilberg had been a military pilot since 1910. He had been adjutant in the Inspectorate of Flight Troops prior to the First World War. During the conflict he had commanded the 2nd Flying Detachment, had been the chief aviation staff officer to Field Marshal von Mackensen’s headquarters, and had been commander of flying units attached to the First and Fourth armies. He emerged from the war with a whole laundry list of medals, including the Knights Cross of the Hohenzollern House Order with Swords, the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd Classes, the Bavarian Military Order of Merit with Swords, the Mecklenburg Military Cross of Merit (2nd Class), the Mecklenburg Military Cross for Distinguished War Service (2nd Class), the Austro-Hungarian Military Cross of Merit (3rd Class), plus Turkish and Bulgarian decorations. From 1920 to 1929 he was chief of the Air Organization and Training Office in the Truppenamt, before doing troop duty as commander of the Prussian 18th Infantry Regiment. Now he was inspector of ordnance (arms) in the Defense Ministry.¹⁰ Unfortunately he had one disqualifying characteristic: he was Jewish.\n\nHermann Goering did not share the anti-Semitism that characterized most of the rest of Hitler’s followers. In private he commented that Jews were much like other people, just a bit smarter, and they had their good and bad, like any other group. Hitler’s anti-Semitic outbursts usually left Goering depressed for hours.¹¹ Unfortunately, Wilberg’s background was too Jewish for even Hermann Goering to be able to hide. He continued to protect Wilberg, however, and even promoted him to general of flyers (General der Flieger), but appointing him state secretary was out of the question.¹² Instead, he turned to Erhard Milch, the director of Lufthansa.\n\nPerhaps the most enigmatic character to come out of the Third Reich was Erhard Milch, who was deputy commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe in its earlier days and who, even more than Goering, deserves credit for its initial construction. Milch was in many ways difficult to categorize: he was arrogant, yet sensitive; selfish, yet patriotic. Looked down on by his peers as a civilian, he nevertheless became a field marshal and was the second-ranking man in the Luftwaffe for much of his career. Most strangely, he was a Nazi whom Hitler personally decorated with the coveted Gold Party Badge, even though Milch’s father was a Jew.¹³ This meant that Erhard Milch himself was half Jewish under Hitler’s racial laws and should have been sitting in a concentration camp according to the rules of the Third Reich, instead of at Goering’s right hand.\n\nMilch was born on March 30, 1892, in Wilhelmshaven, on Germany’s northwestern coast, the son of naval pharmacist Anton Milch.¹⁴ Milch, which means milk in German, was considered a Jewish name by the Nazis. The Nazi racial investigators later produced photographs of tombstones in Jewish cemeteries, complete with the Star of David, bearing the name Milch. Indeed, one of Milch’s brothers became a Jew.¹⁵ There is, however, no evidence that Erhard himself seriously embraced any religion except belief in the Kaiser and, later, his own personal ambition.\n\nAnton Milch left the navy in the 1890s and established his own chemist’s business in Gelsenkirchen, a town in the Ruhr. His wife left him in the 1900s and returned to her native Berlin, taking her children with her. Erhard graduated from the Joachimsthal public school in Berlin in January 1910, and promptly volunteered for active duty with the Imperial Navy. His application for that branch was turned down because of his Jewish ancestry,¹⁶ so he joined the 1st Foot Artillery Regiment at Koenigsberg instead. After eight months’ training, he was sent to the Anklam Military Academy. He graduated first out of 120 cadets and received his commission as a second lieutenant on August 18, 1911.¹⁷\n\nSecond Lieutenant Milch returned to duty with the 1st Foot Artillery in the latter part of 1911. He took a course (probably in gunnery) at the famous Jueterbog Artillery School in 1913 and was engaged in gunnery practice with his unit in West Prussia when World War I broke out.¹⁸ Milch was a battalion adjutant in the 1st Foot Artillery when it helped repulse the Russian invasion of East Prussia in 1914. Later he fought in the bitterly won German victory at Weeden on the eastern front, before being detailed to the 204th Artillery Reconnaissance Battalion on the western front in July 1915. He was promoted to first lieutenant on August 18, 1915.¹⁹\n\nErhard Milch spent most of the next two years as an aerial observer on the western front. His aircraft was an unarmed Albatross B, operating between Metz and Verdun—a very hazardous job indeed. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Milch survived the hell that was Verdun, the Somme, and other bloody battles of World War I. In June 1917, he was transferred to Lille as deputy commander of the 5th Air Detachment, where he had better aircraft and less danger. Selected as a candidate for the General Staff in 1918, he was briefly given command of the 9th Company, 41st Infantry Regiment, near Arras. This Memel unit had already suffered heavy losses against the British, but Milch missed the bitterest of the fighting. After two months of frontline experience, he returned to the air service as an intelligence officer in July, 1918. He was promoted to captain in August,²⁰ but the war ended before he could be transferred to the War Academy for General Staff training.\n\nMilch’s last assignment in the 1914–18 war was commanding officer, 6th Fighter Squadron, a post he held even though he could not fly himself. A few weeks later, the kaiser abdicated, the Second Reich collapsed, and Erhard Milch’s world fell apart. He returned to Germany, embittered by defeat. He reported to XVII Corps Headquarters at Danzig, where he spent several weeks dissolving left-wing soldiers’ councils and engaging in disarmament work, activities which were hardly calculated to improve his attitude. Then, in April 1919, he became commander of the 412th Volunteer Flying Squadron, which Irving described as a motley collection of patriots, soldiers and mercenaries.²¹ This unit was dissolved under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and Milch himself left the military service on January 31, 1920.²²\n\nThere is no reason to believe that Milch was not absolutely sincere in his idealistic belief in Imperial Germany. Its destruction, however, caused a fundamental change in him: idealism in Erhard Milch was extinguished forever. From this period on, Milch became more and more the slave of his own ruthless ambition.\n\nIt is unclear whether or not Milch applied for one of the 4,000 officers’ slots allowed Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, but if he did, he was not accepted. Young Milch did not immediately take off his uniform, however, but joined the East Prussian Freikorps instead. He was soon invited to form a police air unit at Koenigsberg, which he did. He promptly moved his new command from the East Prussian capital to the former zeppelin airfield at Seerapen, away from the revolutionary influences then sweeping the cities. Much to his surprise, he was actually expected to perform police duties with his paramilitary force. His unit was assigned to put down a wave of burglary in the port area of Koenigsberg. After one of his men was killed by a criminal, Milch ordered his men to shoot prowlers on sight and shoot to kill. They did. The burglaries soon ended.²³\n\nThe Allies forced Germany to dissolve her police air squadrons in March 1921, so Milch, now almost twenty-nine, left the constabulary and entered the civilian job market for the first time. He landed a position with Lloyd Ostflug (Lloyd Eastern Airlines) as head of their Danzig office. Lloyd was owned by Professor Hugo Junkers and Gotthard Sachsenberg, a former naval aviator. Soon Milch became business manager of the Danzig Air Mail Service, a subsidiary of the Junkers-Sachsenberg operation. Milch, however, was still haunted by the Treaty of Versailles. The French forced the mail service to close, and Milch was out of business for seven months. He was finally reemployed as an executive with Junkers Airways, Limited, in May 1922.²⁴\n\nThe former captain rose rapidly in the Junkers organization and, before long, was director of its central administration. He successfully expanded Junkers’ operations by skillfully negotiating a financial arrangement with the Polish national airlines. Junkers was soon flying to Warsaw, Lemberg, and Krakow. Eventually the young executive had aircraft flying to Bucharest, Rumania, South America, and the United States. Milch went to America himself and visited the Ford plant at Detroit and other concerns. He was impressed by what he saw and was virtually the only high-ranking Nazi to appreciate the industrial potential of the United States. He also understood the folly of Hitler’s declaration of war against the U.S. in December 1941, but this is getting ahead of our story.\n\nIn late 1925, the Weimar Republic dictated that Germany’s two major airlines—Junkers Airways and Aero-Lloyd—must merge into a single, national airway. To the astonishment of almost everybody, Milch was named one of the three directors of the new super-airline, and he was the only director to come from the Junkers firm. Later he froze out the other two directors, Otto Merkel and Martin Wronsky, and, on September 5, 1929, became commercial director (chief executive officer) of Lufthansa, the German national airline. He was thirty-six years old.\n\nUnder the energetic and ruthless Milch, Lufthansa established regular passenger service with Paris (1926), Marseilles (1927), and Spain (1927). Eurasia, a Lufthansa system, started flying to China in 1930, four years after another Lufthansa auxiliary line was established in South America. By 1933 regular Lufthansa commercial and passenger flights were landing in Rome, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia.²⁵\n\nMeanwhile, Hitler’s political revolution was taking shape in Germany, and Milch, very much aware of his Jewish ancestry and the threat it posed to him if Hitler won power, was not slow to ingratiate himself with the future Fuehrer and his lieutenants. He first met Hitler in 1930 and was quickly impressed with Hitler’s grasp of aviation and aerial warfare and with his overall program, with its attractive combination of nationalism and socialism.²⁶ By 1932, Lufthansa aircraft were placed at Hitler’s disposal free of charge for his election campaigns. Lufthansa (i.e., Milch) was also depositing 1,000 Reichsmarks a month into the personal account of Reichstag President Hermann Goering, who spoke out loudly in favor of Lufthansa interests and appropriations in the German national legislative body.²⁷ Milch’s help in the Nazi party’s time of struggle was not forgotten. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Milch became the Nazis’ first secretary of state for aviation.\n\nMilch did not really want to accept a formal position with the government at first, perhaps fearing that Hitler would be unable to consolidate his power. When Hermann Goering offered him the post of state secretary of Prussia in late 1932, Milch turned it down. Indeed, it took a personal appeal from Hitler to convince Milch to accept the job as state secretary for aviation. Initially, however, there was no Aviation Ministry. Goering’s official title was Reich commissioner of aviation, and Milch was named his deputy.²⁸\n\nNot sharing Hitler’s prejudices, Goering used to say: I am the one to determine who in the Luftwaffe is a Jew and who is not! Milch’s background, however, could not be ignored entirely, so Goering invented an elaborate cover story for his new deputy. An investigation revealed that Milch’s mother had carried on an adulterous affair with Baron Hermann von Bier, a minor aristocrat, for years. Frau Milch, a pure-blood Aryan, signed an official document to this effect, and Erhard’s birth certificate was reissued with von Bier listed as his father. Goering then closed the file, strongly forbidding any further investigation of Milch’s racial background. That ended the matter, for official purposes anyway. Thereafter, there were few men in Nazi Germany who were more verbally anti-Jewish than Erhard Milch. Even so, the whispers about Milch’s ancestry continued until the end of the Third Reich.²⁹\n\nMilch never developed a personal relationship with Hermann Goering. He had, after all, been paying the fat man bribes for years and did not look upon him with a great deal of respect. Down the road, Milch planned to take charge of the Air Ministry and the Luftwaffe himself. Goering would go the route of Junkers, Merkel, and Wronsky and be sacrificed to the ambition of Erhard Milch, or at least that was the plan. First, however, he had to consolidate his own power and create the Luftwaffe.\n\nMilch began his program by dividing the Reich Aviation Ministry (RLM) into a Central Branch, the Air Command Office (LA), the General Air Office (LB), the Technical Office (LC), the Luftwaffe Administrative Office (LD), and the Luftwaffe Personnel Office (LP). The Air Command Office was the most important subdivision and was, in effect, the clandestine General Staff of the Luftwaffe. It was subdivided into the Operations Branch (LA-I), the Organization Branch (LA-II), the Training Branch (LA-III), the Flak Artillery Branch (LA-IV), and the Supply Branch (LA-V), plus signals and medical departments. To officer the RLM, Milch and Goering had to depend on the coordination of General of Infantry (later Field Marshal) Werner von Blomberg, the minister of defense. Fortunately for them, Blomberg was not a selfish man, and he recognized the importance the air force would have in the future. In 1933 alone he transferred 550 officers with aviation experience to the RLM (including his entire air operations staff), followed by about 4,000 junior officers and NCO volunteers.³⁰ More than that, Blomberg did not take this as an opportunity to rid the army of marginal or inefficient officers, as a lesser man might have done. Instead, Blomberg transferred many of his best men to the Luftwaffe. Some of these, including Col. Albert Kessel-ring, made the move with reluctance; others were happy to be back in aviation. Many of the capable General Staff officers Blomberg shipped to the Luftwaffe had no previous aviation experience at all. The list of army officers sent to the new branch included Col. Hans-Juergen Stumpff, an excellent chief of personnel; Lt. Col. Walter Wever, the new chief of the Air Command Office; Col. Wilhelm Wimmer, who took charge of the Technical Office; and Capt. Baron Wolfram von Richthofen, the new chief of the Development and Testing Branch in the Technical Office and one of Wimmer’s two principal assistants. Also transferred to the Luftwaffe were colonels Hugo Sperrle, Hell-muth Felmy, and Ludwig Wolff; lieutenant colonels Hans Geisler, Max von Pohl, Wilhelm Speidel, and Helmuth Volkmann; majors Paul Deichmann, Joseph Kammhuber, Hans Jeschonnek, Herhudt von Rohden, Kurt Student, Otto Hoffmann von Waldau, and Karl Heinrich Bodenschatz; and captains Andreas Nielsen, Hermann Plocher, Joseph Beppo Schmid, and Hans Seidemann.\n\nState Secretary Milch realized that the number of air units he could activate depended on two factors: 1) the production of aircraft; and 2) the number of trained crews the aviation schools could produce. Unfortunately, there were no military aviation schools in Germany in 1933, and the German aircraft industry was very small. To build the Luftwaffe would require money. (Hitler estimated the cost at thirty million reichsmarks; it would actually cost three billion reichsmarks over the next six years.) Milch obtained the funds through Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, the president of the Reichs-bank. Schacht funneled the money to RLM through the Metal Research Company (MEFO), the Autobahn Air Transport Office, the Air Depot of the Volunteer Labor Service, Lufthansa, the South German Lufthansa Company, the Glider Research Institute, and others. Meanwhile, Milch busily expanded the Luftwaffe’s training program. In the spring of 1933 he established the Flying School Command within the Aviation Ministry. Subordinate to the Air Command Office, it was responsible for supervising military aviation courses given in commercial flying schools, as well as making preparations for the establishment of military flight training schools.³¹ The next year Sports Flyers, Ltd., a civilian organization, was placed directly under the command of the state secretary and, in effect, became a paramilitary training organization. The president of Sports Flyers, Ltd., was simultaneously named inspector of reserve flyers. He was none other than Bruno Loerzer, Goering’s World War I comrade (and more recently a cigar salesman), who was destined to become a colonel general in the Luftwaffe.\n\nTo build the new military training facilities and to enlarge the capacity of the civilian schools, Milch had to provide them with aircraft, which meant he had to greatly expand the German aviation industry. Using MEFO funds, he converted locomotive firms such as Gotha and A.T.G., and shipbuilding concerns, such as Blohm and Voss, into factories for the production of aircraft and aircraft components. Existing aviation firms, including Dornier, Heinkel, Fieseler, Arado, Messerschmitt, and Junkers, were given lucrative government loans to expand their factories and production capabilities.³² When Hitler took power in January 1933, there were 4,000 skilled workers in the German aircraft industry. The number grew to 20,000 by February, 1934, and stood at almost 72,000 by June, 1935. By the end of 1933 there were an estimated two million workers employed in other aspects of the Luftwaffe’s buildup, including the construction of airfields, barracks, bases, military housing, factories, training schools, and other facilities.\n\nHugo Junkers, Milch’s former employer, presented problems. The former professor of thermodynamics had invented and patented a full-cantilevered flying wing in 1910. Then he left his university and entered the new field of aerodynamics. He invented the Juno diesel engine for trucks and airplanes and turned the Juno Works into a multimillion dollar operation. By the fall of 1933 he owned two airplane companies. Unfortunately, he was an idealist and a visionary who thought aviation should be used for peaceful purposes only. He built passenger planes and went into a violent rage when it was suggested that his firm design bombers. Milch instantly and ruthlessly turned on his former mentor, who was of no further use to him. He had the old man arrested, threatened with prosecution, and interrogated for six hours at a time. Junkers, the father of twelve, was forced to sell 51 percent of his airline, factories, and other aviation assets to the Third Reich, and he only escaped prosecution on trumped-up charges of treason by dying on February 3, 1935. Junkers was replaced by Dr. Heinrich Koppenberg, who later also fell out of Milch’s favor and was sacked by the state secretary.³³\n\nOn January 1, 1934, the Rhineland Program was launched secretly. Its objective was to create an air force of more than 4,029 aircraft—a force that would impress the Allies by pure numbers. The air force thus created was called the Risk Luftwaffe (Risikoluftwaffe), because it was designed to convince any potential enemy that attacking Germany would be risky. In keeping with this idea, the Risk Luftwaffe was bomber-heavy. It was to include 822 bombers, 590 reconnaissance aircraft, 251 fighters, 51 dive-bombers, and 149 naval aircraft, for a total of 1,863 first-line airplanes. It also included 1,760 trainer aircraft, 89 communications aircraft, and 309 miscellaneous airplanes (mainly experimental prototypes). Many of these planes were obsolete, as Milch and Goering knew. The fighters, for example, were Arado 64s and 65s (Ar-64s and Ar-65s) and Heinkel 51s (He-51s)—all biplanes—but they would have to do until the next generation of aircraft could be put into production. Besides, time was an important factor here. Germany, after all, could hardly expect to keep such a large-scale military buildup secret indefinitely. The Risk Luftwaffe was to be ready by September 1935.³⁴\n\nAs the Luftwaffe grew in strength, it became necessary to set up its basic territorial and unit organizations. The territorial organization was established on April 1, 1934, when six senior air offices were established. Later called Luftkreise (Air Service Commands), they were corps-level units, headquartered at Koenigsberg (I), Berlin (II), Dresden (III), Muenster (IV), Munich (V), and Kiel (VI) (Sea). Each Luftkreis included a senior air commander (Hoeherer Fliegerkommandeur), who was in charge of all aviation units in the Luft -kreis; two or three Air Administrative Area Commands (Luftgaukommandos); a Signal Communications Command; an Air Service Area Medical Battalion; and a Procurement and Supply Group. They also had authority over all civilian airfields and the right to issue orders pertaining to civil air defense. Later, in 1935 and 1936, the Luftkreise commanders were made responsible for the flak artillery units in their areas (under the senior flak artillery commander). They were also responsible for personnel replacement in their zones, and in 1935 they added replacement battalions to their organizational charts. In 1936 these were enlarged to replacement regiments (Fliegerersatzregimente). The Luftkreise (under various names) were the basic territorial units of the Luftwaffe and remained responsible for flak artillery defense and personnel (including pilot) replacement through much of the war.³⁵\n\nTo command the Luftkreise, Goering and Milch induced three Reichs -heer retirees to join the Luftwaffe: lieutenant generals Hans Halm, Edmund Wachenfeld, and Leonhard Kaupisch. All were capable administrators who were immediately promoted to general of flyers. Konrad Zander, a retired naval officer, was also promoted to general of flyers and placed in command of Luftkreis VI at Kiel, where the naval aviation units were concentrated. Two younger Luftwaffe officers, Col. Hugo Sperrle and Maj. Gen. Karl Schweick-hard, both of whom had previously been transferred from the army by Blomberg, were given command of Luftkreise, but they were not promoted.³⁶\n\nDuring the period of the Risk Luftwaffe, the German Air Force organized its basic combat aviation units, which were to remain standard throughout the Second World War. The basic unit was the Geschwader, which was roughly equivalent to a U.S. Air Force wing. Wings included 100 to 120 aircraft and were commanded by majors, lieutenant colonels, colonels, and occasionally by major generals. Wings were designated by their aircraft type. Thus the 1st Fighter Wing was Jagdgeschwader 1 (abbreviated JG 1), the 51st Bomber Wing was Kampfgeschwader 51 (or KG 51), and so forth. Twin-engine fighter wings were designated Destroyer Wings (Zerstorergeschwader or ZG). Training wings (Lehrgeschwader) could be composed of any type of aircraft.\n\nEach wing had a staff squadron (Stabsstaffel) and three (later four) groups (Gruppen) of thirty to thirty-six airplanes per group. Normally commanded by majors or lieutenant colonels, each group had a staff squadron and three combat squadrons (Staffeln). Groups were designated by Roman numerals. Thus II/StG 1 was the II Group, 1st Stuka Wing (Stukageschwader 1). Squadrons (nine to twelve airplanes each) were given arabic designations (1, III/JG 3, for example, referred to the 1st Squadron, III Group, 3rd Fighter Wing). As in the wings and groups, the number of aircraft actually in the typical squadron declined considerably as the war progressed.\n\nSquadrons were further subdivided into sections (Ketten) of three or four aircraft each. A fighter section was called a Schwarm and normally consisted of four aircraft.\n\nOn March 9, 1935, Germany announced to foreign military attachés that the Luftwaffe had officially come into being on March 1.³⁷ One week after the announcement, on March 16, Hitler renounced the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and announced plans to create an army of thirty-six divisions. The Luftwaffe and the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) had come out of the closet.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nCommand Fragmentation\n\nAlthough he never officially held the title, the first chief"
