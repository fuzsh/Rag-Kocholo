        "text": "Flash back to the year 2000, in case the intentionally dated banner above hasn’t already. Societies across the world were relieved that the new year didn’t cause a systemic crash (Y2K). Beanie Babies were deemed the next currency, until Ty backed out on the discontinuation; many Beanie Babies are worth peanuts now. The internet was hideous, and millennials were learning how to code with HTML via Geocities or Neopets (eventually Myspace). Throughout this transitional period, where the future was originally a dream (that quickly vanished), the ‘90s colours and sounds were melted together to try and capture that a digital age would be like. Independent studios were being bought by corporations, so the lines between indies and mainstream cinema was beginning to blur. Suddenly, our excitement for the new age became a nostalgia for how things were. Trending styles were clashing with demands for comebacks. Things got a little ugly.\n\nI said after my 2010’s list that I would be looking at every previous decade in reverse order, and today I carry out the start of this promise. For months, I have coursed through countless 2000’s films, trying to find the one hundred definitive films of this decade. Separating the remnants of the ‘90s from the prognosticators of the ‘10s was interesting itself, as it reminded me how quickly films can evolve within a ten year period. It also served as an indication that the 2000’s had quite a distinctive style. It was a mutt caused by film and technology, as celluloid began to warp into pixels for good; the digitization of film for older DVDs also helped merge the two mediums. Colours were rich, and yet they fizzled. Sounds were fluid, and tinny at the same time. This was the wasteland between analog and digital, and it was glorious.\n\nMany of these one hundred films longed for the days of old, while others awaited — or feared — what was to come next. Cyber-worlds mixed in with dystopias. Biopics coexisted with reinterpretations. Statements of old continued to ring true (and they still do). The internet started off as a somewhat reliable source, but it became the controller of all by the decade’s end. This helped misunderstood films gain new life, and popular films be spoiled by selfish social media users. These seemed like uncertain times, but in a more blissful sense than now. Twenty years ago, we thought the world was going to end because of a glitch. Nothing happened, and it seemed like we had an eternity ahead of us. Now, I look back at the finest works of that decade, which feels so alien to me now. Here are the best one hundred films of the 2000’s.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven’t included documentaries, or any film that is considerably enough of a documentary (mockumentaries don’t count). I haven’t forgotten about films like Waltz with Bashir or My Winnipeg. I’m keeping them in mind for later (wink wink).\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n94. Little Miss Sunshine\n\nSo, we put up with the Hoover family for as long as we can, and deal with all of the neuroses and ego problems. We want to stick together for little Olive and her pageant, right? Plus, it is fun to see this family bounce off of one another, but it’s all the more nurturing to see when they get along. We finally get there, and you simply cannot predict how it ends up going the way that it does. The build up to the climactic scene in Little Miss Sunshine is a fine piece of unexpected comedy, especially because of all of the reparations needed to make this trip work out at all. Now that is how you balance drama and hilarity.\n\n67. What Time is it There?\n\nFor a film so persistently based on the seconds within a day, Tsai Ming-liang's opus is unconcerned with taking its time. Part of What Time Is It There? is the realization that you’re not going to witness life going any faster, and that's around the moment that you begin to be hypnotized by the intricate cinematography and all of the empty spaces. For instance, each character is clock-watching for different reasons; mainly for lovers to return. You hop between the two main vantage points (Taiwan and France) and see the commonality between the two leads, despite their incredibly different interpretations of their own brief encounter at the start of the film. The smartest device is having actor Jean-Pierre Léaud show up in France, while The 400 Blows takes up much of the Taiwain timeline; his past is another's present, and his present is due to become someone else's past.\n\n47. Inglourious Basterds\n\nAt the time of release, Quentin Tarantino was implying that Inglourious Basterds was the best film he ever made. The story ends with the claim that this will “remain my masterpiece”; clearly a line from Tarantino to his audience. Eleven years later, and one thing remains certain. This is definitely Tarantino’s strongest use of tension building in any of his works, by far. The opening conversation (straight out of a Sergio Leone film) is enough anxiety to set the tone for the entire film, and yet we’re never quite prepared for the lengthy, gripping bar sequence no matter what. This is one way to go about revisionist cinema, especially one that has very little to do with historical accuracy. Let’s remember that we’re invested in a film that makes up a glorious way for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party to go down in the same way they treated non-Aryan art: in flames.\n\n46. Syndromes and a Century\n\nYou know you’re in for a treat when Apichatpong Weerasethakul wants to put his spin on a type of story. Syndromes and a Century is his way of appreciating how his parents got together, in his own unique way. The film has two parts, and the dialogue in both is borderline identical at times. It’s like the same story is being told twice, rather than a new second story at all. Both settings are within the medical field, although the second part is in the city, and the former segment is in the countryside. See this as advancement, the shifting of memories, the loss of self, the inevitability of fate, or in any way you want. Syndromes and a Century is a gutsy take on love that not many filmmakers would even dare approach.\n\n37. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThis is where it all starts. It took one year into the new millennium for Peter Jackson’s perfect The Lord of the Rings adaptations to change fantasy cinema forever. The Fellowship of the Ring remains a fan favourite, likely because of the heartfelt cheers and love felt during the first act (which will take hours to return to during the trilogy), thanks to the big Bilbo Baggins party. Maybe it was Galadriel’s haunting opening that let us know things were going to be different. Likely, it’s the assembling of the titular fellowship, and the short time they are actually all together as one unity. Either way, you can likely tell which of the three films is my favourite now, but Fellowship was the guinea pig film that ushered the fantasy genre, action cinema, novel adaptations, and special effects into a new age without any reservations (and all of the marvel, which still remains).\n\n25. Persepolis\n\nHow do you accept that your life is trapped in a cul-de-sac? Marjane Satrapi delivered her final acknowledgements of her motherland in comic form with Persepolis, so it only made sense that she was a major voice in the film adaptation of her story. The Iran she grew up in has been changed by revolution, and the world outside of her motherland is also unforgiving. During her adolescent and young-adult years, Satrapi grew a sense of herself as a voice, but not as an identity. This schism, depicted in two dimensional cartoon form, is a chapter Satrapi may not know how to bundle up in a specific form, but all of its exposed fragments are here for us to pick up and piece ourselves. The key theme is desolation, and Persepolis speaks for the millions of citizens of the world that have had to make do with their ever-changing lives.\n\n24. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nWe have finally reached the reason why this list has a handful of wuxia (or wuxia inspired) works. Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I don't even need to say any more, since there's a good chance you have been a part of the hype at some point. Twenty years later, and nearly every effect and stunt still holds up as cinematic perfection. Lee took a resting genre and brought it to a new age, but he did so correctly. There weren't any cut corners here. This includes the story as well, and the tales of love (old and new) here cut deeply. Every single decision in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was done out of love for a style of yesteryear, with the intent of breathing new life into it. With all of the wuxia films since (and yet none of them quite match this vision), Lee clearly succeeded.\n\n15. The Wrestler\n\nIt’s bizarre to see Darren Aronofsky operating in a more level-headed capacity, considering how gruesome The Wrestler still is. I’d argue it’s possibly his most challenging film, since you can argue that very little of Randy “The Ram”’s experiences shown here take place in his head (outside of that one part where he hears the crowd chanting for him to go work in the deli). There’s no hiding behind the “psychological thriller” label here. The self destruction of Randy leads the way in a film about struggling workers trying to be noticed as humans, even at the expense of loved ones; his estranged daughter, who gives him a second chance, is ghosted by him in the same way society turns their backs on him. In an authentic way, The Wrestler encompasses the daily suffering of someone “wrestling” with life, all for the minor moments where things are actually joyful.\n\n13. Children of Men\n\nIf the human race became infertile, what would happen? Apparently a hell of a lot. Alfonso Cuarón’s adaptation of the P. D. James novel The Children of Men is heavily anchored by the natures of reading. Long passages have lengthy single shots. More frantic moments dart around a lot (either with cuts or by sharp camera pans). His reunion with Emmanuel Lubezki allows Children of Men to have a sliver of hope in the form of natural lighting; otherwise, this all feels too real, with every texture appearing touchable and every detail being highlighted. The actual plot to preserve human life (in more ways than one) show that humanity is as inept as it is advanced. So much of Children of Men’s destruction is self inflicted, and none of it feels too far off from how this situation would actually turn out. As moving as it is thrilling, Children of Men is — at times — a euphoric dystopia.\n\n11. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nArguably the greatest fantasy film of all time. Peter Jackson, cast, and crew, pieced together the Lord of the Rings trilogy right: by working forwards, backwards, and at the same time. All three films carry the same amount of weight, and they end as strongly as they begin (if not, even better). The Return of the King starts off savagely as well, representing Sméagol as a healthy Hobbit before the One Ring takes control of him. Then, we flash to where we are now: the remaining Fellowship members trying to finish off the mission of destroying the One Ring, whilst holding back any opposing armies. Somehow, the fights get even better than the rest of the trilogy (perhaps it’s the gravity of these particular fights), and the conclusion of the trip is done as powerfully as necessary. Don’t give us any nonsense about the ending being too long. You realize the amount of storylines that have to be concluded over the course of this insanely long trilogy? The Return of the King ends just right, and it bows to no one.\n\n8. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nHow often do we squander the present? Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman teamed up for one of contemporary cinema’s most inventive romances with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: a test of memories versus anguish. As Joel Barish’s mind gets erased in backwards chronological order (of every memory he shared with former lover Clementine Kruczynski), you are taken from the most painful parts of their breakup to the moment they fell in love. It’s a reminder that there was something magical here at some point. This mission become a curse, as Joel and Clementine fight to hide in his subconscious, as to preserve what neither party thought they had. Meanwhile, Clementine remains his interpretation of the real person, and their flawed depictions of each other (positive and negative) are a reminder of the inevitable. Still, fate struck twice, so maybe this is meant to be handled responsibly, and with the possibility of hearts hurting in the chase of butterflies.\n\n5. Lost in Translation\n\nSofia Coppola’s personal goal was to recreate the sensation she experienced while lost in Japan listening to My Bloody Valentine’s Loveless album. A minor step was to hire Kevin Shields to take part in creating — and selecting — music for the film. The most crucial necessity was to capture that fever dream she experienced. She managed to do so with Lost in Translation: a pseudo recollection of her isolation and dreariness during her own separation. The joys and the sorrows are all coated in a cinematic haze, and not many films are as uniform as Lost in Translation (nor are they as intricate whilst being this singular). Every scene runs into each other. The cinematography is flattened like a matte finish. This sleepwalking trance makes all of the pain tolerable. Bob Harris’ midlife crisis and Charlotte’s realization that the real world sucks clash together stunningly, as they experience a new side of life in Tokyo. Existentialism has never felt this inviting.\n\n4. In the Mood for Love\n\nMost romantic films wonder where it all started, or where it all went wrong. The leading characters in In the Mood for Love are both backstabbed by their spouses, who love each other ironically. So, these two heartbroken partners are now in cahoots, trying to figure out what happened and where to go from here. The secret ingredient in Wong Kar-wai’s millennium staple is longing, and it’s the main reason why both hurt lovers fall for the exact same trap their respective spouses got caught in. Christopher Doyle’s deep reds soak up every single scene, aside from the colours attached to each character that begin to intertwine with one another. The hauntingly plucked “Yumeji’s Theme” in the score acts as the pulsating heart waiting to be loved or torn. In the Mood for Love presents sadness before fruition is even complete, mainly because destiny cannot be predetermined, but society’s scorn can be.\n\n3. City of God\n\nOne of the twenty first century’s first looks at harrowing cinema, Fernando Mereilles’ cautionary tale City of God is a desolate look at growing up in the worst conditions humanly possible. The gunplay is difficult enough to swallow, until you see children with the exact same sadistic natures seconds later. This is a world with zero nurture, and narrator “Rocket” sees a more meaningful life outside of this slum. His foil, crime lord Li’l Zé, remains one of cinema’s most frightening villains, with absolutely zero remorse or concern for life. Between the breath of death on the backs of all and the mocking name of this city, a brighter future has to be achieved. For many, travel destinations like Rio de Janeiro are a privilege. For others, these are the startling truths that are conveniently pushed aside: a society dismissed by the world, in hopes that it will tear itself down. Rocket’s warnings are out of love and fear of his surroundings.\n\n2. There Will Be Blood\n\nConsiderably the finest anti-western ever, let’s look at how There Will Be Blood is a fantastic counter. The town isn’t what shoos Daniel Plainview away: it's what he wants to conquer. He is a lone wolf in a sense that he only works for himself, even though everyone around him wants what they are owed. Technological progression is already long underway, so no old time western tropes are being shooed out. I'd argue that almost everyone in There Will Be Blood has a hidden agenda, and that we only see Plainview’s greed being completely fulfilled, hence why he dominates the picture. Truth is, Paul Thomas Anderson was concerned with the selfishness of all in America’s race for wealth, especially in the head-butting between capitalism and religious cultism. Blood can be the blood of Christ when He returns to cast all sinners to hell, or it can be the figurative blood of oil that seeps from the ground. Either way, There Will Be Blood is a battle of exploitations in search of the promise land (heaven, or a fancy mansion on top of petroleum seepage).\n\n1. Mulholland Drive\n\nNever has there been a neo-noir for audiences to solve quite like this one. Understandably confusing upon release, David Lynch’s masterpiece Mulholland Drive may have been loved, but not quite in the same way it is now. Its broken narrative is impossible to fully understand the first watch through, but like the greatest case in cinematic lore, it clicks more and more with each subsequent viewing. Now, this abstracted tale of a mysterious accident has become an interpretational dreamscape that lingers in the minds of all viewers for entire lifetimes. Angelo Badalamenti’s haunting score is both retrospective (those Hollywood synthetic strings) and of another dimension (the reverb that clashes all of the sounds together into a cacophony). These melodies make every moment you revisit bittersweet, like the loving memories of a tortured soul on the brink of demise.\n\nLynch brutally dissects genres he loves the most: teen romances with Blue Velvet, soap operas with Twin Peaks, and road films with Wild at Heart. In Mulholland Drive, he went straight for cinema’s jugular. The darkest corridors of the film industry camouflage nicely amongst the sets of films noir of yesteryear. The dreams of being in Hollywood are almost pornographic here, with overacting and heavenly musical swells. As the film continues, the guilt of the film's subconscious rises to the top until a completely awake state is achieved. Then, there’s no hiding from the truth. Mulholland Drive is no longer a celluloid wonderland. It’s the nauseating present time, stitched together by culpability. All that’s left are memories to keep us company before it all ends, and it ends with a single word: “silencio”. This is a reminder that we have watched a film, and that none of this was real; this irons out the film as a post modern opus, and a testimony that cinema was salvaged and slaughtered simultaneously.\n\nWith viewers having to do the bulk of the work in terms of connecting the film's plot, Mulholland Drive does what it needs to do artistically, and every second is sacred (even the uncanny). Upon many visits, it's abundantly clear — to us — that this film is a foggy dream meant to suppress the worst acts of a failed star's life out of spite. This was meant to be her Hollywood moment, but alas even that was not meant to be. The mashing of emotions (euphoria, depression, confused hilarity) have churned Mulholland Drive into one of film's most indescribable experiences. Between the blurred feelings and the jumbled, disjointed story, Mulholland Drive has been heavily discussed ever since it was released. Even at its least understandable form, the film is unquestionably breathtaking. When obsessed over, as a means of figuring it out, it becomes clear. Mulholland Drive opened the new millennium with wonder, splendour, fear and tears. It is the definitive film of the 2000’s, and an insurmountable feat in neo-noir, surreal cinema, and arthouse."
