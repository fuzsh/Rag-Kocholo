        "text": "Max has given a 15-episode, straight-to-series order to drama The Pitt, starring and executive produced by Noah Wyle (ER, The Librarians). R. Scott Gemmill (NCIS: Los Angeles, ER) will serve as showrunner of the series, from John Wells Productions and Warner Bros. Television. The project marks a reunion for Wyle, Gemmill and Wells, who all worked together on ER.\n\nThe Pitt is a realistic examination of the challenges facing healthcare workers in today’s America as seen through the lens of the frontline heroes working in a modern-day hospital in Pittsburgh.\n\n“Collaborating with the visionary talents of John Wells, R. Scott Gemmill, and Noah Wyle to develop this new series has already been an exhilarating process,” said Sarah Aubrey, Head of Max Original Programming. “Their passion, creativity, and dedication to storytelling elevate every aspect of the project, and together, we’re poised to deliver a compelling and authentic portrayal of today’s medical world that will captivate audiences and leave a lasting impact.”\n\nThe Pitt is produced by John Wells Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, where JWP is under an overall deal. Gemmill will write the first episode and executive produce the series alongside Wyle, Wells and JWP’s Erin Jontow, Simran Baidwan and Michael Hissrich.\n\n“We are grateful to Warner Bros. Television and Max for giving us this opportunity to return to the world of urban medicine,” said Gemmill, Wyle and Wells. “The myriad of challenges facing the doctors, nurses, technicians, patients, and their families who work in the trenches of modern medicine have become only more pronounced in the decade and a half since we last visited their stories. We’re thrilled to be able to return to this world with the support of our partners and are looking forward to pushing the boundaries of dramatic realism and medical accuracy in following the lives of these heroic men and women.”\n\nAdded Channing Dungey, Warner Bros. Television Group Chairman and CEO: “It’s no secret Scott, Noah, and John know how to make great television. When they came to us with the idea of reinvigorating the medical TV genre with a fresh, realistic look at today’s modern hospitals, we knew we had to jump on it. Their all-star collaboration, along with their impeccable storytelling and unwavering passion they bring to every project, is the perfect prescription for this show to become the next great medical drama. We are thankful to our partners at Max, and we can’t wait for audiences to see this show.”\n\nWyle is perhaps best known for playing Dr. John Carter in ER, which Gemmill and Wells executive produced. Wyle also starred in TNT’s sci-fi series Falling Skies as well as TNT’s The Librarian franchise. He is currently executive producing The Librarians: The Next Chapter, the CW’s upcoming spinoff of the fantasy adventure series.\n\nGemmill is coming off a 14-season run as writer-executive producer on NCIS: Los Angeles, which wrapped its final season in May. He’s currently a writer and executive producer on Call Me God, a television adaptation of the DC sniper Audible series which is in development at Paramount+."
