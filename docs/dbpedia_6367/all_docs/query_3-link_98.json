        "text": "Who doesn't love a good chick flick? The beloved genre holds some of the best films of the 21st century, and while we can't recap them all, there are a few that stick out to us. Whether it's the iconic quotes that have stood the test of time, the outfits that still influence our everyday looks, or the characters we know and love, these chick flicks have raised an entire generation.\n\nMake no mistake: while this genre is full of wholesome romance, laugh-out-loud comedies, and classic tropes, it's time that chick flicks are given the attention they deserve. Here are some chick flicks from the 2000s that you need to add to your movie list.\n\n1. 13 Going on 30\n\nThis 2004 chick flick stars Jennifer Garner as ambitious and lovable Jenna Rink in this Freaky Friday-like tale. Thirteen-year-old Jenna wishes more than anything to finally grow up, tired of being treated like a kid and longing for the day that she feels like the women she sees in her favourite magazines. On her birthday, the wish comes true and she magically wakes up as her thirty-year-old self, having to grapple with real issues and tough situations, leading to a lot of important lessons and emotional messages for both Jenna and the audience.\n\nThe movie is an essential watch for fans of chick flicks, and you'll absolutely fall in love with Jenna Rink, from her enviable wardrobe to her dream career as a \"big-time magazine editor.\"\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\n\n2. The Devil Wears Prada\n\nAnne Hathaway stars as Andy Sachs, a writer in the big city who truly never saw herself working for a fashion magazine, running errands for the editor-in-chief, or caring about what she wears every day. Somehow, she manages to score a position as an assistant to the editor-in-chief of Runway Magazine, the incredibly intimidating and powerful Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). What follows is a fashion-forward tale of ambition mixed with the complete chaos of Andy having to fit into this new world of glamour and poise.\n\nIf you grew up binge-watching Project Runway and are always on the lookout for the latest issue of Vogue, this is your movie. The style and wardrobe alone are enough to make any aspiring future \"it-girl\" jealous.\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\n\n3. He's Just Not That Into You\n\nWith a star-studded ensemble cast and a highly relatable premise, He's Just Not That Into You explores the many complicated scenarios that come with love, breakups, and all of the relationship drama we know too well. From messy love triangles and finding your soulmate to experiencing complete heartbreak, this movie handles every intricate part of love packaged in a cute, wholesome chick flick that acts as a time capsule for the 2000s.\n\nIf you need a movie that takes a real look at some of life's biggest questions–– Why don't they like me back? Where is my happily ever after? Why is love so hard? –– He's Just Not That Into You will give you just that and more.\n\nIt's real and authentic, with a little taste of drama to bring the entire film together. And if that's not convincing enough, the cast includes Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, Drew Barrymore, and Ginnifer Goodwin, amongst many more of our favourite stars.\n\nRating: 4/5 stars\n\n4. 27 Dresses\n\nAlways the bridesmaid, never the bride–– that's Jane Nichols' life story in 27 Dresses. Played by Katherine Heigl, Jane is career-driven and witty, and also the perfect guest at any wedding! She's always showing up for those around her and takes her commitments to her friends very seriously. When her sister ends up engaged–– and to the man of Jane's dreams–– she reconsiders her position in life as the go-to bridesmaid.\n\nAlso starring in the film is James Marsden as reporter Kevin Doyle, a writer who profiles Jane and her many wedding endeavours, all the while growing closer to her and developing feelings for her he couldn't have ever predicted. It's a quirky tale of finding yourself–– and maybe, at the very same time, finding love. 27 Dresses is the perfect chick flick for anyone who can't resist a good love story.\n\nRating: 4/5 stars\n\n5. John Tucker Must Die\n\nA revenge comedy starring some of the biggest names of the 2000s? Yes, please! John Tucker Must Die unites Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel, and Britany Snow against a common enemy: John Tucker, played by Jesse Metcalfe, a two-faced jock who is a notorious heartbreaker, dating multiple girls at once and leaving them all heartbroken.\n\nThe four girls orchestrate the perfect scheme to break John's heart right back. The mischief and complete chaos caused by these girls and their never-ending ploys of revenge give the audience everything they could ever ask for.\n\nJohn Tucker Must Die is hilarious and the ultimate 2000s flick. A lot of the moments will leave you reminiscing about the era, and it's a great reminder of the kinds of films that were our whole world growing up. Plus, it has the best soundtrack, and the music transports us back to the days of low-rise jeans and Juicy Couture.\n\nRating: 3/5 stars"
