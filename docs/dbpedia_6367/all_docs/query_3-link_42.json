Refer to the online Schedule Booklet for course times, classrooms, and updates.\n\nENGL 2000 – Sections 4, 7, and 25 (English Composition)\n\nTrey Strecker\n\nWriting About Film\n\nStudents in this course will study what constitutes successful film writing through a rhetorical focus on argument. Our reading, writing, and discussion will focus on issues of authorship, genre, representation, and narrative. Students will learn basic film concepts, techniques, and terminology in an effort to think critically about film and its role in our lives. Students will compose in multiple modes to improve their writing skills while gaining a more complex understanding of audience, form, and the contexts that inform effective argument.\n\nENGL 2000 - Sections 2, 17, and 24 (English Composition)\n\nNolde Alexius\n\nOur Built Environment\n\nToday's college students are essential to building environments that are just, accessible, functional, and beautiful. Societal problems are the result of human-made environments, both physical and conceptual. Academic disciplines hold the potential to address these problems. Students in English 2000 - Our Built Environment - will consider how societal problems such as racism, gender inequality, environmental pollution, health risks, may be addressed with interdisciplinary solutions. From there they will choose an area of research that interests them and explore it.\n\nENGL 2000 - Section 27, 28, and 29 (English Composition)\n\nLisa Nohner\n\nLanguage of Horror\n\n100% of Instruction is delivered via the Web. Do you like scary movies? We will explore America's longest standing love affair: the horror genre. Students will study an array of both classic and contemporary horror texts, identifying and analyzing their use of rhetorical strategies and appeals. Through studying arguments found within horror advertisements, literature, film, and critical theory, students will develop a critical lens they can apply to their own analytical discussions and arguments. While students can expect to learn a great deal about the horror genre, this course is primarily concerned with the study of rhetoric, which is essentially the study of how we argue and what makes an argument effective. Students will gain effective reading, writing, research, and analysis strategies for the college environment. Students will practice various kinds of analytical and persuasive writing, from poster analysis and television reviews to a final argumentative essay about a horror film.\n\nENGL 2000 - Section 33 (English Composition)\n\nAnn Martin\n\nWriting and Healthcare\n\nIncludes a Service-Learning Component.

We will read these writers’ fiction in its various forms: short stories, novels, and novellas. Students will learn to think critically about the fiction they read and write one original essay of literary analysis.\n\nENGL 2123 - Sections 1 through 5 (Literary Traditions & Themes)\n\nChris Rovee\n\nComing of Age in Jane Austen's Novels\n\nJane Austen returns again and again in her novels to young adulthood, exploring with unprecedented precision the insecurities, uncertainties, and attachments that define the phase that we associate with 'coming of age.' In this class we will read Austen's novels in their historical context while paying special attention to the essential thread that ties all of them together: their relentless fascination with the exhilarating and often painful process of growing up.\n\nENGL 2123 - Section 8 (Literary Traditions & Themes)\n\nBrodrick Hampton\n\nHeroes in Classic and Modern Media\n\nA survey of “the hero” throughout the history of literature and media—from Perseus to Superman to HALO’s Master Chief. Topics include classic and modern definitions of the hero, the heroic journey, common themes across stories and genres, and the psychological, social, and moral context surrounding our depictions of heroes…and how we respond to those depictions!\n\nENGL 2123 - Section 9 (Literary Traditions & Themes)\n\nAlison Grifa\n\nFood, Hunger, and Dominion\n\nWe are what we eat! Through fiction, poetry, film, and drama, this course examines how our food traditions have influenced our communities, cultures, and civilizations around the world from ancient Greece to the present. Considering recipes of delight and disaster, we’ll discuss food in the context of celebration, security, resistance, and the macabre. How do these texts relate to us even though our experiences might seem far removed from places like Ireland, Vietnam, Nigeria, and the post-apocalyptic U.S.? What are our common folklores, fears, and dysfunctions? Authors may include: Swift, the Brothers Grimm, Lahiri, Truong, Esquivel, McCann, and others.\n\nENGL 2148 - Section 1 (Shakespeare)\n\nJennifer Glassford\n\nSwiftian Shakespeare\n\nDespite being born centuries apart, William Shakespeare and Taylor Swift share the intrinsic ability to unearth the human condition. This semester, we will focus our study on the structure and language that creates complex characterization and complex narratives in Shakespeare. We will examine the connections between the most famous playwright in history and the self-proclaimed, “mastermind” lyricist, Taylor Swift.\n\nENGL 2202 - Section 1 (Introduction to Modern World Literature)\n\nAlexandre Schmid\n\nThis course will explore modernist masterpieces from the 17th century through the 20th.\n\nENGL 2231 - Section 2 (Reading Film)\n\nJulie Roundtree\n\nHorror and the Oppressed\n\nIn this class, we will view a selection of horror films from different points in history and analyze how oppressed individuals are depicted and treated. There will be an emphasis placed on analyzing the depictions and treatment of women, people of color, and those who are differently-abled. The films will be viewed in class, discussions will follow, and students will write three-four essays over the course of the semester.\n\nENGL 2231 - Section 3 (Reading Film)\n\nLisa Nohner\n\nGender & Horror\n\n100% of Instruction is delivered via the Web. This course will study depictions of masculinity in contemporary horror films. We will also identify and evaluate the gendered social desires, fears, crises, and anxieties at play in each text. We will look at how horror’s depictions of gender performance both represent and reconfigure notions of sexuality and gender, and the ways they reinforce or challenge social norms.\n\nENGL 2231 - Section 4 (Reading Film)\n\nJune Pulliam\n\nThe International Horror Film\n\nIn the International Horror Film, we will examine a variety of films that were not produced in the United States to become familiar with monsters from other parts of the world as well as what they reveal about the cultures that produced them. Most of these films are not in English, but they do have English subtitles.\n\nENGL 2231 - Section 5 (Reading Film)\n\nDylan White\n\nThe Horror Genre\n\nThis section of ENGL 2231 will focus on the horror genre. Throughout the course of the semester we will delve into the origins of horror cinema, investigate the diverse subgenres of horror, examine cinematic techniques, study iconic directors, consider cultural and social context and address ethical considerations within the genre.\n\nENGL 2673 - Section 1 (Literature and Ethnicity)\n\nDenis Waswa\n\nThis course will focus on representations of ethnic literature (African and African American) at the intersection of topics like race, gender, ethnicity, and identity politics. While focusing on multiple genres and writers, the course will examine fundamental aspects of literary narrative, from aesthetics to structure, specifically focusing on representations of black identity and selfhood. While this is a literature course, we will acknowledge that ethnic storytelling encompasses and relies on multiple discourses. Hence, we will explore their social, cultural, and historical voices and discuss their styles and techniques. Although our discussions will be less than exhaustive, course projects will allow you to investigate exciting aspects of the texts in more detail.\n\nENGL 2716 - Section 1 (Language Diversity)\n\nIrina Shport\n\nAI-Engaged Humanities and Social Sciences Class. An exploration of sociolinguistic landscapes and language ideologies affecting language use by you and your speech communities.\n\nENGL 3006 - Section 1 (Creative Writing Genre)\n\nEric Schmitt\n\nSongwriting\n\nIn this course, students will learn about the craft and art of songwriting. By analyzing songs from various genres and studying basic song elements, we’ll strive to understand how the songs we love work and then use that understanding to create, and to improve, our own writing. Students will write songs and participate in an inviting and creative workshop environment. Both beginners and experienced songwriters are welcome. It’s not required that students be able to read music; however, a minimal ability to play an instrument or sing will be helpful.\n\nENGL 3035 - Section 1 (Readings in Pre-1800s Literature)\n\nRick Godden\n\nMonsters and Marvels\n\nThe literature of the Middle Ages positively teems with monsters and marvels, with magic and the miraculous. In this course, we will use the confrontation between human and nonhuman, and between natural and supernatural, to survey diverse genres of medieval literature, including the epic, romance, travel narrative, dream vision, and drama. We will encounter carnivorous giants, rather mundane demons, chivalrous monsters, talking birds, pious werewolves, magical objects, and even the undead. In our journey through medieval literature, we will consider the monstrous and the marvelous as a site of contested identities and as an opportunity to interrogate cultural assumptions and anxieties. All readings will be in translation.\n\nENGL 3300 - Section 1 (Rhetoric: Texts and Historical Contexts)\n\nJonathan Osborne\n\nRhetoric of Public Memory\n\nAs a society, we create various artifacts to invoke a particular understanding of a place, person, or event. These markers of history serve as a touchstone for people in the future to remember the past according to a broadly agreed upon narrative about the past. In other words, these artifacts are rhetorical in nature – they attempt to persuade audiences on how to remember the past. In this course, we will investigate, analyze, and question various artifacts, such as museums and Civil War monuments, to understand their rhetorical influence on public memory in terms of politics, race, gender, and culture.\n\nENGL 3550 - Section 1 (Diverse Perspective)\n\nJoseph Kronick\n\nLiterature of the Holocaust\n\nThis study of literature of the Holocaust will focus on the role of testimony, the effects of trauma, and, perhaps most importantly, the problem of representation. We will read memoirs, fiction, essays, and poetry.\n\nENGL 4060 - Section 1 (Studies in the Romantic Movement)\n\nChris Rovee\n\nHomesickness in Romantic Literature\n\nWhat is the longing we call \"homesickness\" and how did this desire for a lost place enter into our secular literature around 1800? This course surveys the writing of British Romanticism with attention to this distinctive modern feeling.\n\nENGL 4121 - Section 1 (Studies in Literary History)\n\nLauren Coats\n\nHow to Judge a Book\n\nHow do we judge the value of a book? In this class, we’ll read American novels and stories – from Poe to Stowe to recent bestsellers – that have captured the reading public’s imagination, and read carefully to see what the stories tell us about how to evaluate them. We’ll also spend some time not reading, exploring other methods for examining books for how they are valued such as judging books by their covers, investigating marginalia, and other archival adventures.\n\nENGL 4148 - Section 1 (Studies in Shakespeare)\n\nWilliam Demastes\n\nShakespeare Our Contemporary\n\nLooking at major plays from a 21st-century point of view.\n\nENGL 4674 - Section 1 (Studies in African American Literature)\n\nAngeletta Gourdine\n\nContemporary African American Autobiography\n\nAfrican Americans are defining \"blackness\" and troubling \"American\" as identities through autobiography. From the spaces of hip hop to fashion, chefs, academics and tech, these voices challenge our notions of black personhood and citizenship.\n\nENGL 4680 - Section 1 (Studies in Post Colonial Literature & Culture)\n\nPallavi Rastogi\n\nNovel Novels: New Fictions of Today\n\nThe novel has historically suggested newness or novelty through its very name. But the word \"novel\" to describe a piece of long-form fiction has become the default nomenclature for the genre when the novel was new, a novelty, only at its inception. So, what constitutes a genuinely new novel, a \"novel novel,\" in other words, today? How are newness and novelty braided into contemporary fiction? Is it possible to write a \"novel novel\" in an age where literary fireworks, bold inventiveness, and the articulation of taboo topics are so widely prevalent? In this class, we will read Global Anglophone \"novel novels\" published in the last two years (2022-2024) and written primarily by authors from South Asia, the Caribbean, Africa, and multi-ethnic Britain, Centering our analysis on literary experimentation, thematic fearlessness, and emotional intensity, we will consider whether these \"novel novels\" live up to their name. Texts may include Sheehan Karunatilaka's \"The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida,\" Jonathan Escoffery's \"If I Survive You,\" and Chetna Maroo's \"Western Lane,\" amongst others. The class is a discussion-style seminar where everyone is encouraged to participate actively.\n\nENGL 4710 - Section 1 (Introduction to Linguistics)\n\nIrina Shport"
