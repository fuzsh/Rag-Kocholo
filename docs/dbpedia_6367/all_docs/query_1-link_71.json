        "text": "They posted a 1yr anniversary photo forKinnPorsche and did not put one of the actors into the photo. (Build jakaphan puttha) even though he is apart of the series and should not be discredited for his hard work, KinnPorsche is a great series and had a lot of work and hard acting put into it with many emotions that could cause harm to the actor of the character if they go to far into the character. Build has done so much for beoncloud (the company kinnporsche is under) and Kinnporsche.\n\nThey have no right to be taking him out of the photo when he is an actor in kinnporsche that had a big impact on the series, he was honestly one of the reason I kept watching because I loved the storyline of his character. (Also love the actor).\n\nIâm pretty sure they did this because of the stuff that has been going on with build and poi, but he was proved innocent which gives them no right to do that.\n\nAlso the vip is TO EXPENSIVE. Viki has some of the same shows on their app for a cheaper price or for free. It is not hard to consider others before yourself, not everyone is made of money. If you want your app to keep success and keep going onward you should consider lowering the price.\n\nThe subtitles on the tv are also very small and hard to read and sometimes look transparent, which is very annoying and inconsiderate to people with bad seeing.\n\nSo anyways concluding all of that , I rate this app 1 star.\n\nI hate this app so much, I never want to see it again, it is the worst app ever I wanted to watch a show, and when I got to episode 2, I was so excited, I was so excited to see what would happen next, and something popped on my screen, and it said to continue on, you have to be VIP, and I was confused, I didn't know what that meant, and then I found out I have to pay to watch the rest of the episodes, I was so excited, I loved that show from episode one I knew was gonna be a good show, and then I get let down by this, I hate how it does that. I understand if you want to make money, but that is messed up, because I was never so excited in my life to watch a show, and then I get let down, and I can't find the exact same show anywhere else on any platform. So this app I hate, and if you want to change that, you can, but that's messed up, and until it's changed, I ain't, don't think I'm ever gonna have it again, unless I find out it has changed that feature, whoever created, this has changed at a feature, then I'll consider getting it back. Because this app really disappointed me and let me down, so I'm never gonna happen again until it is fixed, so I don't recommend anybody else having it either, because you will get let down by anything you're watching, unless you want to pay 8999 yearly monthly, it is 199, but at the end of the day it all adds up to a large number, maybe not 8999, but it's still at very high number, and I'm very disappointed..\n\nUpdate: May 8, 2024 PLEASE CHANGE THE FONT. We need to be able have the font at least outlined. It disappears in a white background, which happens a lot when actors are wearing white clothes or white walls. Please Iâm begging you give us a change in font!!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIQIYI would be a perfect app on Apple TV if it could do two things. Allow the viewer to change the font size, and put a background behind it (or allow our Apple TV to override IQIYIâs app font which is huge white font that disappears if there is a white background in the scene Iâm watching). The second on my list is for Apple TV to fast forward (10sec) or rewind (10 sec) option of the show Iâm watching. I have to drag my finger across my remote and itâs sometimes a hit or miss with the rewind. Other than the issues listed above I love IQIYI and itâs enormous library of Chinese movies, dramas, etc. I have contacted IQIYI several times asking for at least the font issue to be addressed but they continue to send me messages saying they canât do it. I wonder why itâs so hard to change it? Is it really beyond what theyâre capable of doing?"
