        "text": "Get inspired by these extraordinary films about art and artists.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between art and film. Film is a form of art itself and in fact it is one of the most advanced forms of art created by man. Some of the generalized purposes of art and film that unite them are to create a powerful emotional experience, to entertain and to educate.\n\nOver the years Hollywood and European filmmakers have created hundreds of amazing films about artists and their works that inspire audience to appreciate art and learn more about the life story of some brilliant people.\n\nIf you would like to follow the life of the fabulous painter like Frida Khalo or to learn the story of Modigliani read our article to choose the best film for you!\n\n1. Frida (2002)\n\nThe beautiful film Frida (2002) directed by Julie Taymor portraits a private life of the surrealist Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. (Salma Hayek) The film captivates the audience by its beauty, sensitivity and art.\n\nThe story starts with Frida being involved in a bus crash at the age of 18. Though she survived her injuries, they caused her severe pain and extended periods of isolation for the rest of her life – greatly influencing her work, which most often took the form of self-portraits.\n\nThe film includes her complicated and up and down relationship with fellow artist and twice husband Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina), her affair with exiled Russian Marxist revolutionary Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), her constant health struggles, her amputations, her miscarriages, and her bi-sexuality.\n\nThe film Frida breathed life into the story of an incredible individual, who overcame enormous obstacles to create extraordinary art.\n\n2. Modigliani (2004)\n\nThe film is set in 1919 Paris and depicts a story about the Italian artist Modigliani and his tragic romance with Jeanne Hebuterne.\n\nThe film focuses on his last days as well as the vicious rivalry between two brilliant people Modigliani and Picasso. His bitter rivalry with Picasso is one of the story’s primary threads.\n\nThe message of the film is clear: Modigliani’s belief in his work and his passion for art are unconditional. No one can touch them, not even Picasso.\n\nThe film is brilliantly acted by Andy Garcia, Omid Djalili and Elsa Zylberstein. Emotional, tense, and a wonderful show of art, this film is worth a watch.\n\n3. Loving Vincent (2017)\n\nThis visually stunning, beautiful piece of film is a must-watch. It’s an animation imagining the last months of Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh. (Robert Gulaczyk)\n\nDirected by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman the film explores the life and the unusual death of Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nThe most amazing point of this film is that each of 65,000 frames has been painted by hand and in Van Gogh’s post-impressionist style by 125 painters. The whole process took 10 years to complete. The technique literally gave life to Van Gogh’s paintings.\n\n4. Big Eyes (2014)\n\nDirected and produced by Tim Burton, Big Eyes is based on the true story of Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), who was one of the most successful painters of the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe film tells us the story of the artist who became overwhelmingly notorious by his enigmatic paintings of waifs with big eyes. His paintings became a sensation, generating huge earnings and achieving bizarre popular icon status. The truth would eventually be discovered though: Keane’s art was actually not created by him at all, but by his wife, Margaret (Amy Adams).\n\nBig Eyes centers on Margaret’s awakening as an artist, the phenomenal success of her paintings, and her tumultuous relationship with her husband.\n\n“Big Eyes” is full of fascinating questions about the meaning of art, the concept of popularity, and what it means to develop a huge audience.\n\n5. The Agony and Ecstasy (1965)\n\nThe Agony and the Ecstacy is the story of the 16th century war of wills between Renaissance artist Michelangelo (Charlton Heston) and Pope Julius II (Rex Harrison).\n\nThe story itself is really interesting as it opens up the many challenges Michelangelo experienced in completing his famous painting and this from a man who did not consider himself a painter but rather a sculptor. Charlton Heston plays a strong Michelangelo with a temper, and Rex Harrison is terrific as the pope.\n\nThe film will please art and history admirers and leave a wonderful aftertaste.\n\n6. Caravaggio (1986)\n\nCaravaggio is biographical film which depicts us an adventurous life of a baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (Nigel Terry) who became much more renown as Caravaggio. It is actually a town near Milan in Italy where the painter came from.\n\nThe film paints the biographical details, from his boyhood apprenticeship in Milan, escape to Rome, and patronage from the Cardinal Francesco Del Monte and the notorious taste of Caravaggio for street fights and carousing.\n\nFilm is expressionistic and engaging, and will make you understand the nature of the artist named Caravaggio.\n\n7. Death and Maiden (2016)\n\nDeath and Maiden is a biopic about Egon Schiele, one of the most provocative artists from Vienna at the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\n“Death and Maiden” is a painting of a 17 year old Wally, who is arguably artist’s true love who became immortalized in it.\n\nEgon Schiele’s radical paintings scandalize Viennese society but notable and fearless artist as Gustav Kilmpt sees them as exceptional.\n\nThe film portrays Egon Schiele as an artist who leaves a vast legacy to this world after his own ephemeral and turbulent life.\n\n8. Basquiat (1996)\n\nBasquiat is set in New York 1980s and tells us a story of of the life and suffering of Jean-Michel Basquiat (played by Jeffrey Wright) an American artist of Haitian and Puerto Rican descent born in 1960.\n\nThe film depicts his life as a street artist who actually lived on the streets, his discovery by Andy Warhol (David Bowie) and others, how he became an in-demand graffiti and neo-expressionist artist, and his death from a drug overdose at his art studio at the age of 27.\n\nThe film vividly re-creates the 1980s New York art scene from firsthand experience.\n\n9. Pollock (2000)\n\nPollock depicts the life of the American abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock.\n\nThe film portraits a life journey of Pollock from struggling artist to international success and enfold his battle with alcoholism and his death in a car crash.\n\nThe director of the film is Ed Harris who also played a part of Jackson Pollock and earned Oscar for “Best Actor”.\n\nJackson Pollock was known for his drip paintings, which have become some of the most expensive works ever sold.\n\n10. Séraphine (2008)\n\nSeraphine directed by Martin Provost was a critically acclaimed film and the winner of seven Césars – the French Oscars – including best film.\n\nThe life of French painter Séraphine Louis was portrayed in this biopic . Working as a cleaning lady, Séraphine ( Yolande Moreau) was discovered and promoted by German art collector Wilhelm Ude (Ulrich Tukur) and later became a famous representative of the Naïve art movement with her works featuring intensely repeated floral arrangements.\n\nShe famously incorporated in her paintings such materials as soil and the blood of dead animals, which she found on her daily walks.\n\nAndrei Rublev (1966)\n\nAn expansive Russian drama, this film focuses on the life of revered religious icon painter Andrei Rublev (Anatoliy Solonitsyn). Drifting from place to place in a tumultuous era, the peace-seeking monk eventually gains a reputation for his art. But after Rublev witnesses a brutal battle and unintentionally becomes involved, he takes a vow of silence and spends time away from his work. As he begins to ease his troubled soul, he takes steps towards becoming a painter once again.\n\nAndrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky is considered one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of Russian cinema. His films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory\n\nRodin (2017)\n\nIn 1880 Paris, 40 year-old sculptor Auguste Rodin finally receives his first state commission, “The Gates of Hell,” which includes “The Kiss” and “The Thinker,” two of his most famous creations. Constantly working, he shares his life with his lifelong partner, Rose, and his mistress, the young Camille Claudel, the gifted student who becomes his assistant and a talented sculptor in her own right during a decade of passion, mutual admiration and creative collaboration.\n\nRenoir (2012)\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir paints on the French Riviera in 1915 after his wife dies and his son is wounded in a battle. He finds a young woman named Andrée who becomes his last muse and model.\n\nLittle Ashes (2008)\n\nIn 1922, Salvador Dalí arrives at university in Madrid, where he befriends Luis Buñuel and Federico García Lorca. Dalí soon feels a strong attraction towards the latter, and a passionate romantic relationship ensues.\n\nDetails of the relationship between artist Salvador Dalí and poet Federico García Lorca have long been the subject of speculation and debate among historians and biographers. In Little Ashes, Dalí’s and Lorca’s feelings are shown deepening into a love affair that the sexually repressed painter tries (but fails) to consummate.\n\nGirl with a Pearl Earring (2003)\n\nWhile working as a maid in painter Johannes Vermeer’s house, Griet gets closer to him. Later, she becomes the face of Johannes’ most prolific works of art wherein she poses with pearl earrings.\n\nGoya’s Ghosts (2006)\n\nWhen the prominent Spanish painter Francisco Goya’s muse gets arrested by the Church on account of heresy, her father pleads with him to secure her release as he is in good terms with Brother Lorenzo.\n\nTim’s Vermeer (2013)\n\nTim Jenison, a Texas based inventor, attempts to solve one of the greatest mysteries in all art: How did 17th century Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer (“Girl with a Pearl Earring”) manage to paint so photo-realistically — 150 years before the invention of photography? The epic research project Jenison embarks on to test his theory is as extraordinary as what he discovers.\n\nNight watching (2007)\n\nRembrandt takes up the commission to paint a portrait of the Amsterdam Musketeer Militia.

After the unique beginning to their love affair, the well-connected and volatile artist assimilates Dyer into his circle of eccentric and often cold friends, including the caustic Muriel Belcher, as Dyer’s struggle with addiction strains their bond.\n\nSavage Messiah (1972)\n\nIn the Paris of the 1910s, brash young sculptor Henri Gaudier begins a creative partnership with an older writer, Sophie Brzeska. Though the couple is 20 years apart in age, Gaudier finds that his untamed work is complemented by the older woman’s cultural refinement. He then moves to London with Brzeska, where he falls in with a group of avant-garde artists. There, Gaudier encounters yet another artistic muse in passionate suffragette Gosh Boyle\n\nAt Eternity’s Gate (2018)\n\nWillem Dafoe is Van Gogh in this journey through the world and mind of a man who overcame scepticism, ridicule and illness to create some of the world’s best-loved paintings – not least The Dance Hall in Arles(1887) in Gallery 19. It covers the last few years of his life, notably his friendship with Gauguin, the ear business, and his death.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)\n\nFrance, 1760.

But, his health and obsession with work weigh heavily on his wife, who finds affection with a young Italian.\n\nDirector Greenaway’s visual technique heightens Kracklite’s alienation. There are few close-up shots of the other actors beside Dennehy, who himself is dwarfed by the monuments of Roman architecture surrounding him. Scenes take place at various Roman sites, including the Pantheon, the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Victor Emmanuel II Monument, the fountains of Piazza Navona, as well as Hadrian’s Villa.\n\nCamille Claudel (1988)\n\nWhen renowned French sculptor Auguste Rodin (Gérard Depardieu) notices the raw sculpting talent of the beautiful and precocious Camille Claudel (Isabelle Adjani), the two artists begin a scandalous love affair.
