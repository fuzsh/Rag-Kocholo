But there's one thing left to do: write a film synopsis.\n\nWhat’s a film synopsis?\n\nA film synopsis is typically a one-page document that summarizes your film. It contains the film's title, genre, logline (a one-sentence summary), and a five-paragraph explanation of the film's storyline, major plot points, and key characters.\n\nWhy you should write a synopsis\n\nA screenplay synopsis is a vital tool in the filmmaking world, helping you sell your movie idea to agents, managers, producers, studio execs - basically anyone in a film production job. It's often the first thing a reader will see of your work, and it needs to grab their attention while accurately conveying the essence and tone of your film. It should be engaging and succinct, offering a clear vision of the film's narrative arc without divulging every twist or turn. The synopsis must serve as a sales tool, highlighting why your film is unique and why it should be made. Before anyone commits to reading your full screenplay, they'll want to check out a one-page synopsis. So it's super important that you get it right.\n\nThe likes of screenwriting maestro Aaron Sorkin probably won't have any trouble getting someone to read their script without a synopsis. But if you're not in Sorkin's league, you'll probably spend a bunch of time emailing query letters to try to grab people's attention. To do that, you'll need to include a short synopsis that sells.\n\nThe difference between a film synopsis, logline, and treatment\n\nIt’s easy to confuse a synopsis with a logline or film treatment. But while they’re similar terms, there are a few important differences.\n\nSynopsis: One-page script summary. A synopsis, while more detailed than a logline, is still concise, summarizing the entire arc of your story, including its emotional journey and key plot points. A synopsis example might detail the protagonist's challenge, their pivotal decisions, and the climax, all while keeping the reader intrigued and wanting more.\n\nLogline: One-sentence script summary (read our logline guide). A logline is a brief summary that introduces your story in a nutshell, often captivating interest with its brevity and wit.\n\nTreatment: Longer scene-by-scene breakdown of the storyline that screenwriters use to pitch a movie idea before writing the full screenplay (read our film treatment guide). A treatment delves into much greater detail, laying out scenes and sometimes dialogue, to convey a clear vision of the film's flow and structure. It's a tool for the writer as much as it is for pitching the story, allowing both the creator and potential backers to see the narrative's bones before the screenplay is fully fleshed out.\n\nHow to format your synopsis\n\nBefore you dive in and start writing your script synopsis, make sure you get to know the basic formatting principles.\n\n1. Write a header\n\nAt the top of the synopsis, write your script's title and state that it's a synopsis. Under the title, let the reader know what genre your synopsis is. If your film's Rocky, for example, you'd write: ‘A rags to riches sports drama'.\n\nUnderneath the header, add your name, address, email address, and phone number. This is super important, especially if the person reading your synopsis receives it from someone else and doesn't have your details. If you have a Writers Guild of America (WGA) registration number, add that, too.\n\n3. Write the logline\n\nNext, add your logline before the first paragraph. This gives your reader a taster of the storyline. A logline is typically two sentences that identify the main character, the challenge they're trying to overcome, and why they need to overcome it. You might also want to follow the logline with a paragraph that explains why your screenplay is appealing for filmmakers.\n\nMuch like a good pasta sauce, you only need a few ingredients for a tasty logline. Four, to be precise:\n\nInciting incident\n\nMain character\n\nCentral conflict\n\nAntagonist\n\nOnce you've got those four ingredients, you can put them together in different ways. Like this, for example:\n\nWhen inciting incident happens, the main character decides to do central conflict against antagonist.\n\nMost screenwriters advise writing loglines that are only one sentence long. Some people say no longer than 30 words. But if your movie is on the complicated side, you might need to stretch your logline to a couple of sentences.\n\nCheck out our helpful guide: How to write a logline\n\n4. Introduce the main characters and setting\n\nKeep this part to one paragraph, max. It should include:\n\nYour characters’ names and occupations\n\nWhere your characters live and work\n\nThe time period of the story\n\nThe reason you’re telling the story\n\nType the characters' names in capital letters (e.g. ROCKY) when they first appear. After that, type them normally (e.g. Rocky).\n\nMake sure your synopsis includes the protagonist, antagonist, love interest, allies of the protagonist or otherwise important secondary characters. You don't need to include the names of smaller characters.\n\n5. Summarize Act 1: The Setup\n\nStick to three paragraphs or half a page. Introduce the characters and the main conflict that drives the story.\n\nThe first act is where you set the stage at the beginning of the story. It shows the viewer who your main character is, what their life's like, and what they care about. Importantly, you want to communicate some of the challenges that your character is facing. Obviously, your character wants to overcome these challenges, which has a big impact on how the story progresses.\n\nThen, you'll need a catalyst or ‘inciting incident' – something spicy that happens to get the story started. This will spark a series of events that sets the protagonist on an epic journey of character development. It inspires their character arc and helps them reach their goals.\n\n6. Summarize Act 2: The Conflict\n\nThis part should be about a page long. Show all the plot twists and conflicts your characters face.\n\nThe second act is where your story starts hotting up, as your intrepid protagonist sets out to achieve their goal. It's the point of no return. It's also where your character starts hitting roadblocks as they get to know their new situation, and see the many challenges ahead of them. The intensity of the story escalates, with plot twists that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Our protagonist, now fully committed to their quest, encounters unexpected challenges that test their resolve and force them to adapt.\n\nThis is a good time to flesh out the rest of the characters in the story, both friends and enemies, as well as the protagonist. Enemies become more formidable, their motivations clearer and their actions more directly opposed to the protagonist's goals. The central conflict deepens, revealing that the struggle is not only external but also internal, as the protagonist grapples with personal doubts, fears, and the realization that the journey may change them in ways they hadn't anticipated. You'll also want to expand on the story's central conflict, whether it's a person or a thing.\n\n7. Summarize Act 3: The Climax\n\nLimit this part to three paragraphs or half a page. Explain how the main conflict ends and what happens to your characters after. Don’t worry about spoilers – your reader needs to know what happens. Make sure you tie up any loose ends.\n\nThe third act is where your narrative arc culminates, the story comes together, and we see the final clash between our protagonist and antagonist. Often, this is the point where we get to witness the true strength of the antagonist – after not seeing much of them in the film – which can surprise the protagonist.\n\nYour viewers are probably aware that the main character will win in the end – after all, that's how stories usually go. But it's much more exciting if you keep them on tenterhooks for as long as possible.\n\nLearn how to structure your story with our guide: Find Your Perfect Story Structure in Three Acts\n\nTop tips for writing your movie synopsis\n\nKeep it brief\n\nYour synopsis should be roughly two to three pages long. A one-page synopsis is likely to not have enough detail, but anything over three pages is too bulky. Your reader should be able to finish reading your brief synopsis in a few minutes, and have a good idea of whether it's right for them.\n\nWrite in the present tense\n\nYou should always write in the present tense, even if your story's set in the past. For example, ‘Rocky punches Apollo Creed' not ‘Rocky punched Apollo Creed'.\n\nUse the third person\n\nAlways write from a third person perspective, using pronouns like ‘he,’ ‘she,’ and ‘they.’\n\nGet your spacing and paragraphs right\n\nUse single spacing. Keep each paragraph single spaced. Place an extra space between individual paragraphs. When you start a new paragraph, don't indent.\n\nUse a simple font\n\nWhile you might love Comic Sans, your reader probably won't. Stick to a simple font like Times New Roman or Arial, in font size 12 – unless submission guidelines ask for something different.\n\nStick to the main plot points and main characters\n\nYou don't have a lot of space to play with, so skip the subplots and secondary characters. If it's not essential to your script's A-story, cut it.\n\nWrite in the style of the movie's genre\n\nIf it's a comedy movie synopsis, it should be funny. If it's an action synopsis, make it exciting and energetic. Whatever the genre, the narrative should constantly be moving forwards. Each beat in your synopsis should cause the next beat or be the effect of the previous beat.\n\nEmphasize character development\n\nIn your quest to hit all the plot points, don't forget to call out your character arc. Your protagonist's motivations, and emotional turning points, need to be clear. Make sure each main character has at least one distinctive characteristic that helps them stand out from the other characters.\n\nUse simple language\n\nNow's not the time to show off your creative writing chops. If a Hollywood exec's going to jump on board, they need to understand the plot. Avoid superfluous adjectives and adverbs, and stick to simple, succinct, clear language.\n\nAsk for feedback\n\nSend your synopsis to friends and family, and ask them to spot any sneaky spelling or grammar mistakes. They can also let you know if any parts of the synopsis aren't clear to them. Keep refining and editing your synopsis until it's error-free and flawlessly clear to anyone who reads it.\n\nPrepare to make edits\n\nWhen submitting your synopsis to different places, they may well have specific guidelines. Make sure you make any changes necessary to follow those guidelines. Agents, movie studios, and other readers may also ask for changes to fit established word counts or page counts.\n\nFilm synopsis examples"
