        "text": "You can finally watch The Iron Claw from the comfort of your own home. The film about the legendary wrestling family was released on digital platforms on Feb. 13, but when will The Iron Claw make its streaming debut on Max?\n\nDirected by Season Durkin, the biographical sports drama is based on the true story of the Von Erich family, the wrestling dynasty who left a significant mark on the sports world. Set in the early 1980s, Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson, and Stanley Simons star as the Von Erich brothers, who all embark on professional wrestling careers led by their father, Fritz Von Erich (Holt McCallany). Fritz was a famous wrestler in the ’60s and ’70s and was best known for his finisher called the Iron Claw.\n\nWhile achieving immense fame in the wrestling industry, the Von Erich family faced a series of tragedies depicted in the film. The family became associated with these devastating personal events, which were coined as the “Von Erich curse.”\n\nDurkin told IndieWire in December 2023 that he was drawn to telling the story of the Von Erich family after watching interviews that Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron’s character) has done. “He spoke so openly and honestly and at length about his family’s trauma, his own personal experience, stories of his upbringing, stories of his own considered suicide,” said Durkin, who’s also behind independent films like Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011) and The Nest (2020).\n\nThe director also revealed that Efron was the first person he approached about playing Kevin, the eldest Von Erich brother. “Zac was the first person I met with. When I met him, he’s just got this kindness, this sweetness to him, that I knew Kevin needed.”\n\nThe former High School Musical star told Deadline that it was an opportunity he’d been waiting for. “I’ve always wanted, and I feel like maybe this is it, just the opportunity through a movie to leave something of value for the audience,” Efron said. “This experience and hearing people’s words on the movie, it just means everything, man. It’s hard to put into words.”\n\nTo prepare for his role in The Iron Claw, Efron worked out multiple hours a day, beginning with volume training to gain 15 pounds of muscle. “That necessity to be perfect — it became an obsession,” Zac admitted to Variety. “It was a singular focus for months. And your life goes out the window during prep.” He continued, “Then I was able to incorporate old-school body-building and Olympic lifting and really achieved that specific look of pro wrestlers, which was really hard.”\n\nMeanwhile, Efron’s co-star Jeremy Allen White didn’t believe it was “physically possible” to transform into his character Kerry Von Erich. “I knew I couldn’t get as big as Kerry. I just don’t think it was physically possible for me,” White told IndieWire. “I’m a pretty little guy, but I tried. I don’t think it’s possible for any human on the planet.”\n\nWhite revealed that he had to commit to a “gross” high-protein diet. “[I was] eating all the time. Like, never stopping,” White added. “In the morning, I would have waffles, almond butter. In the middle of the day, I was eating turkey patties and avocado all the time. It’s really just gross. You’re trying to consume as much as you possibly can, and, to be honest, you don’t feel great. I was training as well, but, I don’t know, trying to get that big, it’s no way to live.”\n\nHow To Watch The Iron Claw\n\nThe Iron Claw is available to buy digitally for $19.99 on video-on-demand platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Vudu as of Feb. 13, 2024. The Iron Claw is still playing in select theaters.\n\nWhen Is The Iron Claw Coming To Streaming?\n\nThe Iron Claw will eventually be available to stream Max, but the release date has yet to be announced. The wrestling film will likely make its way to the streamer sometime in April or May.\n\nThe film’s production company, A24, signed a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery in December 2023 to bring its theatrical films — including The Iron Claw, Priscilla, Dicks: The Musical, and more — to their streaming site in 2024. Stay tuned to learn exactly when The Iron Claw will arrive on Max.\n\nWatch the trailer for The Iron Claw below."
