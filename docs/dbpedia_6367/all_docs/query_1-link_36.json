        "text": "On the homepage of Max, the streaming TV platform created by the merger of Hbo Max and Discovery+, changes were introduced in December, then implemented from the end of July to recommend TV programmes and films more closely to each user’s tastes, Liesel Kipp, senior vice president of global streaming products at Warner Bros. group, told Variety. Discovery\n\n“We’re focusing on de-duplicating titles, so we’re improving the exposure of the catalogue by eliminating repeat titles and balancing that with suppressing watched content,” Kipp said, stating a key element of the new system.\n\nThis means, Kipp explained, that if customers continue to ignore titles after several impressions – or if they have already watched them – “we have enough information about what they have watched and remove them to make room for other titles to be displayed and perhaps more relevant content”.\n\nThe team christened the changes made as Whole Page Optimisation (WPO) and specified the main things they look at to measure the streamer’s success: homepage efficiency (i.e. how often a visit to the homepage turns into playback); product viewing time; the number of return visits to Max; and the diversity of content watched. But the new features don’t end there: a button to restart a title from the beginning, instead of having to rewind the tape to the beginning, and an option to allow titles to be classified as ‘To love’, ‘To like’ and ‘Not for me’.\n\nPhoto Credits: Pxhere"
