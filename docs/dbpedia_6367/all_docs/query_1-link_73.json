        "text": "Max von Sydow (born April 10, 1929, Lund, Sweden—died March 8, 2020) was a Swedish actor who was perhaps best known for his dour brooding characterizations in the films of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nInterested in the theatre from childhood, von Sydow studied at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm (1948–51). He established his reputation as one of Sweden’s most promising young actors at the Norrköping-Linköping Municipal Theatre (1951–53). He then gained popularity at the Municipal Theatre in Helsingborg (1953–55), the Municipal Theatre of Malmö (1955–60), and the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm (1960–62), where he appeared in productions as varied as William Shakespeare’s King John and Arthur Miller’s After the Fall.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nVon Sydow made his film debut in a minor part in 1949. His first Bergman film was the allegory Det sjunde inseglet (1957; The Seventh Seal), in which he portrayed a gaunt knight who plays a game of chess with Death. Von Sydow’s aloof presence and the spiritual complexity of the characters he portrayed contributed significantly to the gloomy atmosphere and ambiguity characteristic of Bergman’s films. Other Bergman films in which von Sydow appeared include Ansiktet (1958; British title, The Face; American title, The Magician), Jungfrukällan (1960; The Virgin Spring), Sasom i en spegel (1961; Through a Glass Darkly), Nattvardsgästerna (1963; Winter Light), Skammen (1968; Shame), and En passion (1969; The Passion of Anna).\n\nDuring the height of his career in Sweden, von Sydow also appeared in a number of American films, portraying Christ in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) and a fanatical missionary in Hawaii (1966). His subsequent English-language films included The Exorcist (1973), Voyage of the Damned (1976), and Three Days of the Condor (1976). In 1982 he appeared in the Swedish film Ingenjör Andrées luftfärd (The Flight of the Eagle).\n\nVon Sydow’s career took a downturn in the 1980s when he appeared mostly in insignificant character roles. He had memorable moments in films such as Never Say Never Again (1983), Dreamscape (1984), and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), but not until 1988 did he revive his career with an Oscar-nominated performance in Pelle erovraren (Pelle the Conqueror). After that he turned in fine performances in numerous international films, including the American productions Awakenings (1990), A Kiss Before Dying (1991), What Dreams May Come (1998), and Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)."
