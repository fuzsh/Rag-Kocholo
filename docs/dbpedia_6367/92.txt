Because we're always in the mood for a classic J.Lo rom-com.

The best movies of the 2000s can be divided into a few categories that dominated the decade: the rom-com boom that gave us classics like The Wedding Planner, slapstick comedies (of the Judd Apatow variety, especially), intense award-winning dramas, and experimental films that are hard to place anywhere (looking at you, Napoleon Dynamite).

In short, there's a lot to choose from—so we had to pick a lane. And with the world being such a tumultuous place, we decided to stick with feel-good movies from the 2000s. Here you'll find the kinds of movies you still watch over and over again because they're that good. Some have won Oscars, but that certainly wasn't a determining factor.

So though this list of the best movies of the 2000s is not an all-encompassing guide to the decade, it does have a lot of comforting nostalgia you can add to your rotation today. Check out 41 of our favorites below—in no particular order!—plus where you can stream them on Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video. When you're done, check out the best movies from the 2010s.
