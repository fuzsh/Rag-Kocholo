Not one of my total favourites, but it's a decent, standard dance song.\n\nPost by HER MINAJesty on\n\nmeh...I said it in June and I'll say it now, the song is ok, nothing special, IMO. It's too cookie-cutter, dance/euro for my liking. I remember hearing it all the time at the club in the summer and it's just kind of annoying, it's like one of those songs little 12 year olds who think they are cool like lol what an analogy"
