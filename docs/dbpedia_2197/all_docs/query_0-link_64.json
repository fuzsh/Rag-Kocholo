But this is mid summer when the charts should be packed with big songs. This isn't even including the amount of songs that have been hanging round the charts for over a year such as bloody Casso - Prada which spent over half a year in the top 10.\n\nDancing In The Dark was a really strange choice of song for the OCC to suddenly decide deserves to be reset to ACR.\n\nWhy? Because England fans were singing the song and changing the lyrics to \"Foden's on fire\".\n\nThree Lions and Sweet Caroline plummeted sharply last week so the fact that Dancing In The Dark is still inside the top 40 is odd to say the least.\n\nThe OCC create ACR to freshen up the charts, then shoot themselves in the foot with examples such as Dancing In The Dark.\n\nWhich this song somehow avoid going back to ACR as it increases its streaming this week. üòÑüôÑ\n\nLike the advert says *sniff sniff* \"wow! it's SO fresh\" üòê\n\n1\n\nThe UK Charts ARE awful.\n\nHave to agree with you - and it‚Äôs not just because I‚Äôm quite old . I thought 2023 was a great year for music so I do appreciate a lot of modern music. However, the charts are so immobile in 2024. There are hardly any new songs entering the top 40 each week , instead we have the same old same old dominating the top 20. Will Benson Boone ever depart the top 20?! Something is very wrong . Even MTV is utter rubbish these day with only 2 channels promoting modern music. I‚Äôve always said that there is good music out there if you look for it , now I‚Äôm not so sure.\n\nBy means of balance I should add that Billie Eilish , Dua Lipa and to some extent Charli XCX are making good music. Taylor Swift seems to be running out of ideas - although her lyrics are still good . I think Taylor should take a break and ‚Äòrefuel‚Äô , myself. Songs which I like seem to do nothing / very little in the charts - Disclosure : She‚Äôs Gone Dance On, BeckyHill‚Äôs True Colours , Catfish and the Bottlemen‚Äôs brilliant Showtime are three examples.\n\nUnfortunately, I can‚Äôt see things improving in 2024. A sign of the times? Now that was a stunning Prince album!\n\n1\n\nThis is the problem with streaming in the charts. It's nothing new - I've been saying this since the infamous Justin Bieber top 3 in January 2016 that the UK charts represent nothing for the most part.\n\nWhen you see great new singles getting released and Spotify (especially) don't give these songs any exposure on their playlists, it's difficult for any decent new release to chart highly.\n\nIf Spotify scrapped curated playlists and users had to search for the music they wanted to listen to, only then would the daily rolling UK top 50 truly represent what is popular.\n\nIf that means Mr. Brightside is #1, so be it.\n\n100k people selecting Today's Top Hits, click play then do the cleaning while the music plays in the background will never make the UK charts reflect what is popular. It merely reflects which songs Spotify are pushing the most.\n\nHence why it's mostly the same songs that appear in the Spotify UK Top 50 from one day/week/month/year to the next.\n\n3\n\nHere is the first look at how the new chart is shaping up so far this chart week\n\nBased on physical sales and downloads Friday and Saturday - Friday streams\n\n1 ( 1 ) - Please Please Please - Sabrina Carpenter\n\n2 ( 3 ) - Good Luck Babe - Chappell Roan\n\n3 ( 5 ) - Stargazing - Myles Smith\n\n4 ( 2 ) - Birds Of A Feather - Billie Eilish\n\n5 ( 8 ) - Austin - Dasha\n\n6 ( 6 ) - Houdini - Eminem\n\n7 ( 9 ) - Espresso - Sabrina Carpenter\n\n8 ( 11 ) - A Bar Song ( Tipsy ) - Shaboozey\n\n9 ( 13 ) - Kisses - Bl3ss / CamrinWatsin / Bbyclose\n\n10 ( 7 ) - Angel Of My Dreams - Jade\n\n11 ( 10 ) - Not Like Us - Kendrick Lamar\n\n12 ( 18 ) - 360 - Charli XCX\n\n13 ( 12 ) - Band4Band - Central Cee / Lil Baby\n\n14 ( 15 ) - Too Sweet - Hozier\n\n15 - Guy For That - Post Malone / Luke Combs\n\n16 ( 16 ) - Beautiful Things - Benson Boone\n\n17 ( 23 ) - Apple - Charli XCX\n\n18 ( 14 ) - Slow It Down - Benson Boone\n\n19 ( 17 ) - Kehlani - Jordan Adetunji\n\n20 ( 20 ) - Did It First - Ice Spice / Central Cee\n\nFriday positions in brackets - new entry in bold\n\n1\n\nThis is the problem with streaming in the charts.

It merely reflects which songs Spotify are pushing the most.\n\nHence why it's mostly the same songs that appear in the Spotify UK Top 50 from one day/week/month/year to the next.\n\nI actually don't mind the concept of curated playlists. Spotify have loads of those and \"Today's Top Hits\" is basically just their equivalent of Capital FM. They have loads of specialist playlists too which cater to the niche of the niche, and aside from Spotify's own curated playlists there are thousands of other curators on the platform that have built playlists with huge audiences, and independent artists can pitch their music to them.\n\nTaking away curated playlists would do more harm than good as these days most people don't really listen to radio outside of their car, music TV is more limited than its ever been since Channel 4 ended The Box etc, and most people don't actively go seeking new music they haven't heard before. The only solution would be to force users to listen to algorithmically selected content, in a similar fashion to the Release Radar and Discover Weekly playlists (I have to say the Release Radar playlist is extremely good at finding new releases I like that I wouldn't have actively searched for or heard of).\n\n0\n\nIMO the biggest problem with today's music market is that so much modern commercial music is written and produced purely with streaming in mind. It's all very clinically (and cynically) made to be as easy to listen to and forgettable as possible, so you'd barely notice if you heard it repeated several times a day on a Spotify playlist - and that's basically what the Today's Top Hits playlist consists of.\n\nI don't think this is just because songwriting standards have declined or anything like that, I think it's entirely deliberate because it's only a thing in mainstream pop music.\n\nI find most songs written or performed by Ed Sheeran in the last 6 years are like this, and Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" is a prime example. It sounds like a zillion other pop songs in recent years, sung in cursive with a laidback, easy to listen to beat that's enjoyable in the moment but instantly forgotten as soon as it's over. None of these songs are going to be regardless as classics in 5-10 years.\n\nPretty much the only stuff that's really stood out in the last year or two is the dance orientated stuff which is obviously designed to make an impact because of where it's going to be played. Hannah Laing \"Good Love\", Calvin Harris \"Miracle\", Blessed Madonna \"Happier\" etc. But that's the sort of thing which is going to get annoying for fans of pop music after a while, and isn't going to trouble the top end of the chart unless it has a massive name attached. Other than that the only pop song I can really say has stood out massively in the last year or so is Olivia Rodrigo \"Get Him Back\", or Ariana Grande \"Yes And\" (which was really a good example of the clubby stuff I mentioned).\n\n0"
