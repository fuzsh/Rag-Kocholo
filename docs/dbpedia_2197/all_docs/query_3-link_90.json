CD is a skillful masterpiece of relaxing compositions, beautiful sound patterns and energetic rhythms. His style is unique and refreshing. It's easy listening. To best describe his style, it has been said that most music fans who enjoy Yanni, Kenny G, and Spyro Gyra will love the musical creations by Dietmar Scherf. His music is creative and free-spirited with plenty of oomph in the right places. He let's the instruments do the singing and the talking. This CD contains contemporary instrumental music at its best. Listeners have said that Dietmar's music brings healing to the soul. With skillful recording techniques at the Bel Air Art Factory, a crystal clear sound for all instruments was achieved. While it's a fully digital recording, much professionalism has been applied to make all instruments sound natural, especially in solo parts. This CD is certainly a MUST-HAVE for every CD collection.\n\nSong Descriptions:\n\nNice To Meet Ya! (8:06)This song opens like an overture. Emerging out of a thunderstorm--signifying the troubles of life--the sax, within a fast-paced upbeat rhythm, indicates the transposition into a new world of unlimited freedom, enjoyment and tranquility. Driving along the endless highways of the Midwest USA, and over the next hill, heaven opens up for you to enter. Tender piano improvisations seem to knock down all remaining walls to set you free. A sense of eternity comes to mind.\n\nDown South At The Bayou (Part 1 & 2) (5:53)It begins like a traditional railroad country tune. As the accordion dances to the country beat in the first part of this song, it carefully prepares the second part, leading us straight into Cajun country. Folks are happy and are living in another world. They laugh and they dance. Away from common conveniences of modern life, the Cajuns go on enjoying their lives the old fashion way accompanied by their own music.\n\nFrom New York To L.A. (6:11)The Big Apple ... Radio City Music Hall ... The applause ... Manhattan ... Wall Street ... The Statue of Liberty ... New York: always an exciting place. The sax and the vibes accompany us on this journey to the West Coast. Meeting all kinds of people in every state. It's funky. It sets us free and encourages us to take action, to communicate with each other, and to break down the walls of selfishness. Enjoy the trip.\n\nIt's A Long Journey (6:22)It sounds a bit like Arabic night. Exotic, a touch of another world, the country of Aladdin. Yes, take the magic carpet and fly across the land. See the stars awake on the horizon. It's all yours to enjoy. Saxophone and a Bedouin blowing a bottle accompany us on this adventurous journey. In the distance, you'll see the pyramids and the camels in the desert.\n\nWelcome To Montevideo (5:12)The beaches of Rio and Punta del Este. Absolute relaxation at the ocean in the shade under a palm tree. The sound of a guitar, and a sax, and a trumpet swinging to the bossa nova. It's siesta--all worries have disappeared. Work can wait--tomorrow is another day. You're in Montevideo where time stands still. Relax, enjoy the peaceful surroundings, listen to the waves as they make their way unto the beach. Watch the seagulls maneuver skillfully through the air.\n\nAcross The Islands (7:11)A koto introduces this trip across the islands of the Caribbean. The turquoise waters, unlimited blue skies, tender waves and white beaches, a native sitting with a pan flute playing to the rhythm of the reggae. The trumpet proclaims relaxation. There's no competition in this place. It's your world of peace and tranquility. God made everything so beautiful.\n\nSo Many Different People--So Many Different Cultures (3:22)A fast-paced ska theme to describe the diversity of people and cultures around the globe. It's island music, because we all live on our own little island. There's action, and trumpets utter victory. Every person is unique.\n\nHaven't We Met Before? (6:05)Gaze at the heavens. Yes, there are angels. Is it a deja vu? Have we really met before? The sound pattern is accentuated by a tender maiden choir. Are we exiting our universe into new worlds in search of our Creator? The sound of powerful organs encourages us in our relentless pursuit. He can be found on earth through His Word and through His Spirit. It's a triumphant orchestral final.\n\nPrecious Moments (4:56)Daydreaming. We're relaxing and the vibes try to gently wake us. Here comes the sax to argue on our behalf to let us rest a little while longer. Smooth sailing ... a beautiful melody and my soul is touched. Creativity awakened in us. We relax and enjoy the strokes upon our souls. Receive the inner healing.\n\nComin' Home (5:32)After a long journey it's always enjoyable to come home again. Shaku and pan flute open us the door in this waltz to welcome us back home. Shake off the dust and keep the memories. The old sofa is still there. Life has so much to offer. The sax leads us into new dreams and new imaginary worlds of unlimited freedom, enjoyment and relaxation.\n\nFrom the Artist:\n\nNICE TO MEET YA! is an album that I had to record. It was important for myself, but I also needed to share my musical creations with many. I created this album for no other reason than to create beautiful music for the soul--something we all like to hear over and over again. It's music that relaxes us and allows us to dream, while it paints beautiful pictures in our minds, setting our imaginations free.\n\nNICE TO MEET YA! is an exciting musical journey. Certain rhythms will invite us to dance and to simply be ourselves. Without the need to adhere to creative limitations, I was able to create music that I really like. This makes this CD an unforgettable adventure in which dreams come true.\n\nDedication:\n\nThe NICE TO MEET YA! CD is dedicated to Baby Grace. Baby Grace never saw the light of this world, but instead her soul went straight from her mother's womb to heaven into Jesus' arms to meet God Almighty, who is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who created everything in the universe. We're anxiously awaiting to meet Him and Baby Grace someday in the not too distant future.\n\nWarning: This recording may relax you very much and it could cause extensive daydreaming. It may even prevent nightmares and possibly put you peacefully asleep.\n\nCD List Price: $10.99>Buy this Music CD Now!\n\nHEAR SONG SAMPLES! >Check today's low CD Price Now!
