This is the big question everyone who is involved in weddings is asking, the suppliers and more importantly the couples whose weddings have been disrupted, and those that potentially could be disrupted.\n\nI have spent some time thinking about this big question, and also chatting with other suppliers, and please don’t think I’m being negative, I am just trying play devil’s advocate. Thousands of couples have had to put their wedding plans affected by the current situation, many have postponed their big day to a later date, and some have their day cancelled completely, I truly feel for you all.\n\nPersonally I have already rescheduled most of my 2020 weddings up to July, and now some in August and September are starting to be moved. Unfortunately, I’m beginning to think some of the weddings that were rescheduled to later this year, might have to be rescheduled again.\n\nOnce we come out of this, I am beginning to wonder if this will change weddings forever.\n\nWhat will weddings look like immediately after lockdown?\n\nOnce again, I need to reiterate that I don’t want to be negative, I am just highlighting some thought of myself, and a few wedding professionals. I truly hope I’m wrong and that things return to normal as soon as it’s safe.\n\nFirstly, let’s look at what’s going to happen initially, when the lockdown is relaxed. Most people are thinking that the Government will probably enforce, or at least recommend, restrictions on the number of people who will be able to gather at an event. How will this affect weddings? Most of the weddings I entertain at there is between 50 and 100 people during the day, with extra guests invited to join in the evening. Who knows what the restricted number will be, the consensus is 40-50.\n\nHow will people behave in large groups, will they be nervous? Will people be wearing PPE? People used to laugh at old wedding photos because of the fashions people were wearing. After the lockdown is relaxed, some people are likely to continue wearing gloves and masks, this could make for interesting photos. Some people may decide to stay away from large gatherings.\n\nWhat will weddings look like after lockdown in the longer term?\n\nHopefully in the longterm, things will get back to something resembling normality, we will all want to party with our loved ones, maybe hug each other more,\n\nFinally …\n\nThis is sort of mine and a few colleagues thoughts, and as I said I am just playing devils advocate\n\nCLICK HERE to go to the Chelmsford Registrar website for their latest guidance.\n\nWhat do you think? What will weddings look like after lockdown?\n\nIf you would like a chat, either email me on [email protected] , text or call me on 07736-880 790\n\nhttps://ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ian-Stewart-Wedding-DJ-Logo.png 0 0 Ian https://ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ian-Stewart-Wedding-DJ-Logo.png Ian2020-04-26 15:52:582020-04-26 15:52:58What Will Weddings Look Like After Lockdown\n\nThe End Of The Wedding Disco\n\n/\n\nWhen meeting with couples to plan their wedding I always ask them how they want to happen at the end of the wedding disco, and they nearly always say that they hadn’t given it any thought, for me how we finish the night is almost as important as how we start the wedding. This is the final memory that you and your guests are going to have of your wedding day, do you want it just fizzle out or end with a memory that you will last for years. If done correctly this is a truly amazing photo opportunity. Obviously, the choice of song that your wedding DJ plays is also very important as this will determine the atmosphere created in the room.\n\nWhat are your options?\n\nA Circle\n\nAn Arch\n\nA Big Anthem with everyone on the floor singing at the top of their voices\n\nA Slow Song\n\nA Circle or sometimes called the “Circle Of Love” and there are two options here, firstly all your wedding guests form a circle on the dancefloor, you and your partner pick a point in the circle, one of you goes clockwise, the other goes in the opposite direction, you then say goodbye to all of your guests. While this is happening we play some great fun music, and once you have both said goodbye to all your wedding guests you all dance together to your last song.\n\nThe alternative is with all your guests in the circle, you and your partner dance in the middle to your last song.\n\nAn Arch This is where your wedding guests stand in two lines opposite each other and link their hand with the person in front of them, and as your big last song is played you can either\n\nRun through the arch hand in hand with your partner or\n\nwalk through saying goodbye to all your of your wedding guests\n\nAfter the arch, you can either leave the wedding reception or stay and say your goodbyes\n\nThe Big Anthem some people don’t want either of the above and want their wedding disco to end with everybody joining them on the dancefloor dancing and singing together to your favourite singalong anthem.\n\nSlow Dance a romantic way to end your wedding, with everyone a smooch on the floor, and bring back the first dance song is a great way to close the wedding.\n\nSong Options\n\nAbba – Thank You For The Music\n\nAerosmith – Don’t Wanna Miss A Thing\n\nAndy Williams – Can’t Take My Eyes Off You\n\nBeatles – Hey Jude\n\nBeyonce – Still In Love\n\nBill Medley & Jennifer Warnes – I’ve Had The Time Of My Life (Dirty Dancing)\n\nBob Marley – One Love\n\nBob Marley – Three Little Birds\n\nCarpenters – We’ve Only Just Begun\n\nDaft Punk – One More Time\n\nDaniel Bedingfield – If You’re Not The One\n\nDennis Waterman – I Could Be So Good For You\n\nDiana Ross & Lionel Richie – Endless Love\n\nDixie Cups – Chapel Of Love\n\nDJ Sammy – Heaven (Candlelight Mix)\n\nDon McLean – American Pie\n\nFlorence & The Machine – You Got The Love\n\nFrank Sinatra – My Way\n\nFrank Sinatra – Theme From New York New York\n\nGerry Marsden – You’ll Never Walk Alone\n\nGlee – Don’t Stop Believing\n\nJackie Wilson – Higher & Higher\n\nJackie Wilson – I Get The Sweetest Feeling\n\nK-Ci & Jo Jo – All My Life\n\nKygo Ft Parson James – Stole The Show\n\nLionel Richie – Hello\n\nLonestar – Amazed\n\nLouis Armstrong – What A Wonderful World\n\nLuther Vandross – Always & Forever\n\nMaria McKee – Show Me, Heaven\n\nMark Ronson & Amy Winehouse – Valerie\n\nMarvin Gaye – Let’s Get It On\n\nMetalica – Nothing Else Matters\n\nMonkee’s – Daydream Believer\n\nMoody Blues – Nights In White Satin\n\nMorcombe & Wise – Bring Me Sunshine\n\nNora Jones – Come Away With Me\n\nOasis = Champagne Supernova\n\nQueen = Don’t Stop Me Know\n\nRobbie Williams – Angels\n\nRobbie Williams – Every time We Say Goodbye\n\nShania Twain – You’re Still The One\n\nSnow Patrol – Chasing Cars\n\nStevie Wonder – For Once In My Life\n\nStevie Wonder – You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\n\nTake That – Never Forget\n\nTake That – Shine\n\nTony Christie – (Is This The Way To) Amarillo\n\nU2 – Beautiful Day\n\nVarious – Perfect Day\n\nVera Lynn – Wish Me Luck As You Wave Me Goodbye\n\nWannadies – You & Me\n\nWill Young – Your Love Is King\n\nIf you would like to chat about how we can create an amazing end to your wedding reception, either text or call me on 07736-880 790, or email me at [email protected] or fill in the short contact form here.\n\nhttps://www.ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2466-min-e1554462249231.jpg 367 495 Ian https://ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ian-Stewart-Wedding-DJ-Logo.png Ian2019-03-20 17:39:122019-04-05 11:08:31The End Of The Wedding Disco\n\nWedding Timeline\n\n/\n\nWedding Timeline\n\nI have been a wedding DJ for over 30 years, and one of the most common questions couples ask me about is their Wedding Timeline. Where you are getting married will slightly affect the timeline, but not by much, I am going to share two separate wedding timelines with you, one if you are getting married at a church or registry office, and one for weddings at one venue. I am going to include times for these, as I am going to assume that you are getting married at 1 pm for a church wedding and 2 pm for a wedding at an all-day venue. Of course, you can adjust the wedding timeline to fit with your wedding timings, hopefully, tho it will give you an idea\n\nChurch Wedding Timeline\n\n8:30 am – Hair & makeup people arrive\n\n9:00 am – photographer arrives\n\n10:00 am – Bride & Bridesmaids get ready\n\n11:30 am – Pictures with the bride & her wedding party\n\n12:00 pm – The groom & his ushers arrive at the church for pictures\n\n12:30 pm – Wedding guests arrive at the church\n\n12:35 pm – The bridal party leave for the church\n\n12:45 pm – The wedding guests take their seats\n\n12:55 pm – The bride & her bridal party arrive at the church\n\n1:00 pm – The brides’ procession\n\n1:05 pm – The wedding service\n\n1:45 pm – Pictures at church\n\n2:30 pm – Travel to the wedding reception venue\n\n3:00 pm – Arrive at the wedding reception venue\n\n3:10 pm – Reception Drinks\n\n3:20 pm – More Photographs (if needed) / Mix & Mingle with your guests\n\n4:15 pm – Receiving Line\n\n4:30 pm – Grand Entrance\n\n4:45 pm – Wedding Breakfast (ask me about how this can be so much more than a meal\n\n6:15 pm – Toasts & Speeches\n\n6:45 pm – Prepare the room for the evening wedding party\n\n6:50 pm – More Pictures If Needed / Mix & Mingle with your guests\n\n7:00 pm – Evening guests start to arrive, your wedding DJ will play appropriate early evening music\n\n7:45 pm – The cutting of the wedding cake (if it wasn’t cut at the end of the wedding breakfast)\n\n7:50 pm – 1st dance, plus the father and daughter dance if you are having one\n\n8:00 pm – The wedding DJ gets the party started\n\n8:30 pm – The evening buffet is served\n\n11:50 pm – The last songs of the night\n\n12:00 am – Goodbyes\n\nSingle Venue Wedding Timeline\n\n9:30 am – Hair & makeup people arrive\n\n10:00 am – photographer arrives\n\n11:00 am – Bride & Bridesmaids get ready\n\n12:30 am – Pictures with the bride & her wedding party\n\n1:00 pm – The groom & his ushers arrive at the venue for pictures\n\n1:30 pm – Wedding guests arrive at the ceremony venue\n\n1:45 pm – The groom has his interview with the registrars & the wedding guests take their seats\n\n1:50 pm – The bride & her bridal party arrive ceremony room, and the bride has her interview with the registrar\n\n2:00 pm – The wedding ceremony\n\n2:30 pm – Reception Drinks\n\n2:35 pm – Photographs / Mix & Mingle with your guests\n\n4:00 pm – Receiving Line (if you are having one)\n\n4:15 pm – Grand Entrance\n\n4:30 pm – Wedding Breakfast (ask me about how this can be so much more than a meal\n\n6:15 pm – Toasts & Speeches\n\n6:45 pm – Prepare the room for the evening wedding party\n\n6:50 pm – More Pictures If Needed / Mix & Mingle with your guests\n\n7:00 pm – Evening guests start to arrive, your wedding DJ will play appropriate early evening music\n\n7:45 pm – The cutting of the wedding cake (if it wasn’t cut at the end of the wedding breakfast)\n\n7:50 pm – 1st dance, plus the father and daughter dance if you are having one\n\n8:00 pm – The wedding DJ gets the party started\n\n8:30 pm – The evening buffet is served\n\n11:50 pm – The last songs of the night\n\n12:00 am – Goodbyes\n\nAs you can see there are some subtle differences between the two wedding timelines, but as I said previously it gives you an idea of what needs to be considered when planning your wedding day.\n\nIf you would like to chat about planning your perfect wedding timeline then please give me a call or text on 07736-880 790, email me at [email protected] or complete the very short contact form here\n\nhttps://www.ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wedding-Timeline-Lightbox-min.jpg 2754 3699 Ian https://ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ian-Stewart-Wedding-DJ-Logo.png Ian2019-03-09 11:02:472019-03-21 10:42:38Wedding Timeline\n\nTop 100 Wedding Floorfillers 2019\n\n/\n\nTop 100 Wedding Floorfillers 2019\n\nSo I have counted the dancers and can reveal what are the Top 100 Dancefloor Floorfillers for 2018 at the functions that I entertained at in 2018.

The whole country is understandably ecstatic, everybody wants to watch the next game versus Sweden. Then you think to yourself hang on, the game is on Saturday at 3 pm, right in the middle of my wedding. So hopefully this small blog will help you with advice about world cup football & your wedding day.\n\nYou might be getting messages asking if there will be a TV at the venue as they want to watch England v Sweden in The World Cup.\n\nIn my years of working as a wedding DJ, there are three solutions to this problem, after listing the solutions, I will let you know what happened at these weddings\n\nIt is the biggest day of you and your partners lives, it’s your wedding day, it’s a once in a lifetime day. The world cup happens every 4 years so the guests can miss one game. I don’t want the football at my wedding. We have spent good money on food etc.\n\nYou understand that some people will find a TV somewhere, and understand that they will disappear for a while and find the TV to watch the game.\n\nAs the game is at 3 PM, right in the middle of our wedding day we are going to embrace the football, put a screen into the room and all watch the game together.\n\nNow, what are you thinking of doing? In the past, I have worked at weddings where all three of these solutions have happened. Here is what happened\n\nPeople still found a TV to watch the game and disappeared for the two hours the game was on. At one wedding The Bride got very upset and even told the guests that she wasn’t happy and asked the venue to turn the game off. Some people left the wedding never to return.\n\nThis worked perfectly fine, those that wanted to watch the game did, those that didn’t stay within the wedding party, both people were happy although the party was split for a while. everybody returned to the wedding and the party continued.\n\nThe couple put a screen into the room where the wedding was being held and everybody watched the game together, it created a great atmosphere and once the wedding was over the party continued.\n\nOnly you can make the decision about how you deal with The World Cup at your wedding, but put yourself in the shoes of your guests. As A wedding DJ couples often tell me that they want all their guests smiling, and having fun.\n\nMy advice is either solutions 2 or 3, If I was the Master Of Ceremonies / DJ at your wedding I could make number 3 really fun. Because happy guests mean a happy wedding, which means a happy Bride & Groom.\n\nIf you would like some advice or help please call or text me on 07736-880 790 or email at [email protected] or complete the contact form here.\n\nhttps://www.ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wedding_football.jpg 534 800 Ian https://ian-stewart.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ian-Stewart-Wedding-DJ-Logo.png Ian2018-07-04 10:20:042019-09-02 16:10:13Advice About World Cup Football & Your Wedding Day\n\nTop Dancefloor Songs 2017 – Wedding DJ Ian Stewart\n\n/\n\nTop Dancefloor Songs 2017\n\nSo I have counted the dancers, and checked the songs, and can reveal what was the Top Dancefloor Songs 2017 at the functions that I entertained at in 2017.\n\nThis is the Top 100\n\nUptown Funk – Bruno Mars\n\nShow Me Love – Robin S / Steve Angello / Sean Finn\n\nI Wanna Dance With Somebody – Whitney Houston\n\nShape Of You – Ed Sheeran\n\nMr Brightside – Killers\n\nSeptember – Earth Wind & Fire\n\nCan’t Stop This Feeling – Justin Timberlake\n\nYou’re The First, The Last My Everything – Barry White\n\nYoung Hearts Run Free – Candi Staton\n\nDespacito – Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Ft Justin Bieber\n\nLivin’ On A Prayor – Bon Jovi\n\nSuperstition – Stevie Wonder\n\nI Want You Back – Jackson 5\n\nBlurred Lines – Robin Thicke\n\nNever Too Much – Luther Vandross\n\nCrazy In Love – Beyonce\n\nTurn Me On – Kevin Lyttle\n\nBillie Jean – Michael Jackson\n\nAin’t No Mountain High Enough – Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell\n\nYeah!
