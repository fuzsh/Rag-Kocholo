Hope that helped!\n\nActually,\n\nThe song is buy a girl in Washington named Samantha beltran\n\nWhat are the lyrics to everytime we touch by cascada?\n\nI still hear your voice when you sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dreams Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive 'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last I need you by my side ?Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go I want you in my life Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky They wipe away tears that I cry The good and the bad times, we've been through them all You make me rise when I fall 'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last I need you by my side 'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go I want you in my life 'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last I need you by my side"
