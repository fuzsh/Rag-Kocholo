        "text": "Studio 24 – A new era\n\nInspired by the disco and funk era, the new album „Studio 24“ is currently in production. The collaboration with renowned German producer Christian Geller is responsible for the musical development. The new songs bring a fresh perspective to the iconic sounds that made the legendary „Studio 54“ club in New York world-famous. They once again demonstrate Cascada’s talent for integrating different musical elements into her distinctive style and appeal to both loyal fans and new listeners.\n\nNatalie Horler describes the idea as pure passion: „What I’ve always loved about the Studio 54 era is its legendary aura and the outcry for freedom and self-expression. Back then, you could walk into the club naked or ride in on a white horse. Nobody batted an eyelid. I just love that kind of thing.“\n\n„Ain’t No Mountain High Enough“ – a modern classic\n\nThe first single „Ain’t no Mountain High Enough“ is a modern and powerful interpretation of the soul classic by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell – newly produced with the unmistakable Cascada flair. The song is regarded in music history as one of the great classics of soul and the Motown era. The message of unwavering devotion and the willingness to overcome any obstacle has turned the song into a timeless embodiment of love and connection."
