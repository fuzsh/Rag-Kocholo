        "text": "im a big lover of dance, trance, hardcore (the music kind all though i am partial to a bit of the xxx ) etc\n\nihave been painting my bedroom all morning with clubland tv on,\n\nnow so far i have heard a cascada mix of all there songs, cascada - what hurts the most 4 times.\n\nand a few others , all in 4 hours.\n\nwhat IS the obsession with this band?\n\nthey havnt created one single song that is theres they are all covers, they are all rubbish.\n\ni so wish they would at least create there own stuff maybe then i would give them something but at the moment they are the worst group ever to exist in any genre of music.\n\nif there is anyone on here that disagrees with me please tell me why.\n\nWell the new clubland TV channel is \"owned\" (or something like that) by AATW (record company) which promotes...amongst others in the UK....Cascada.\n\nHence they will have their own acts on the station. Just take a look at the list of artists for the upcoming Clubland \"live\" tour.\n\nYes Cascada have done quite a few covers ! The only original material released as singles in the UK are Miracle and the latest one What Do You Want From me.\n\nNot sure you can call them a band ? At best they are a trio...two DJs and Natalie Horler on vocals. On some sites they promote Natalie as Cascada. BTW, I think Natalie is a very talented singer when given some decent original material and allowed to actually sing live...instead of lip-syncing !\n\nThe music is upbeat (if a little repetative) and I was a fan...still am to some extent...until the last album. With Cascada they (talking about record companies) seem to be wanting to cash before the bubble bursts. For example the US release of Perfect Day.....which differs to the UK version.\n\n0\n\nETWT, TMD, NED, WHTM, LC.\n\nThat makes five to me!\n\nThat's only what they've released as singles...ok, LC was out on one of the TWO CDs with WHTM. Only Miracle and the latest release What Do You Want From Me (less covers !!) are original.\n\nOn the albums EWT....Kids in America, How Do You Do, Wouldn't It Be Good plus the first three above . In fact EWT and TMD are on the album twice ! That said I do like this album I did go out and buy it !\n\nPerfect Day...WHTM (twice), Because The Night, Sk8er Boi and for the worst cover I've ever heard....Just Like A Pill. Didn't buy this album !\n\nThe last two have been dropped from the US release of the album as have two other songs from the album. Three \"new\" songs have been added....it seems of those two may be covers ?\n\n0\n\nHmmmmmmm I quite like the H20 track\n\nCascada- i like a few of her tracks but they all sound similar which is nothing bad but after a few listens its all just a bit generic!\n\nNot too keen on Basshunter though, I think when I first heard it 'CHAV' was the first thing that came into my mind but thats not being snobbish thats just my opinion!\n\n0"
