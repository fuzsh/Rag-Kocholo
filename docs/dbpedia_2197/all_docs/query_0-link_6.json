Evacuate the Dancefloor marks a fresh start for one of the world's most successful Dance acts, and looks likely to dominate the airwaves throughout the rest of the year. Cascada found international fame with their huge, debut hit 'Every time We Touch'. a smash in the States before the band had even toured there, the song quickly caught on across the globe, followed by a multi-platinum 500,000 selling album that spawned eight singles, including the massive 'Miracle' and a dance cover of Savage Garden's 'Truly, Madly, Deeply'. Their second album, Perfect Day, continued Cascada's reign as one of the world's Top 10 selling dance acts. 23 tracks. Universal. 2009."
