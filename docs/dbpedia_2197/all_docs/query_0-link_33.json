        "text": "haha truly, I totally dislike that pop**bleep**ty music, unless it is mixed into a 'hands-up' song, then I would say \"good\" more to the beat than the vocal or person who sings itself. There are plenty popsongs which have been mixed into 'hands-up' which makes it \"listenable\" :P.\n\nYes, I posted this with reason. Spotify doesn't work sometimes in Facebook Social, so my friends in Facebook don't see how cool music I play 24/7. However I still listen some pop and rock songs, but most of time only bass-powered music like I described before.\n\nhaha, my page got stuck too but it still posts songs I dont really bother if the weird page stays like this or not, but if it is possible to change it back, then I would do that.\n\nOh and i think i remember now that I had that too that it doesnt post songs! I closed Spotify and restarted it, replay the song and then it posts again!\n\nThis 'hands-up' kind of music is much known in Germany, weird that the neighboring country doesn't know about this kind of musc (where I live).\n\nI've been listening to these songs. I find Dacia not bad, FHM 2k12 sounds not bad/good, watched on youtube :D. The rest of em no opinion!\n\nHAHA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRROpiNAvPw :D. You are exactly me XD, every song i like, i add to playlist ain't bothering if playlists getting huge! I find Italobrothers' songs so 'basic', same with Cascada, yet i like the remixes by others of their songs :P. Awkward is listening to foreign language music while i dont understand anything they say :D, well i still add those to playlist because the song itself, the vocals and bass/melody etcetc, matches eachother i like it!\n\nAnother thing is when 'hands-up' djs remake old songs by adding bass/melody etc. to the song and i am like 'hey i remember this song!' then i search the song name and find old songs thanks to those djs\n\nYes I feel same way.\n\nThose are basic, but with those tracks I find this music. Heared Cascada's Everytime We Touch 2006 from Radio and after that true dance music lover.\n\nSo thank you Cascada.\n\nThis is the reason why I still listen some basic dance stuff. I have memories with those songs, I finded that music listening those from Local radio. However these days no dance music in radio, only Lady Gaga stuff.\n\nAnd Ryan Thistlebeck - LIFE! Ryan Thistlebeck – Rising - Zooland Bootleg Radio Edit\n\nEvery remix where Ryan T. and Rick M. - true music orgasm.\n\nthat is true! I heard Miracle from Cascada the first time from a cassette if im right O.O. After that the rest came slowly, my brother also listen/listened to this music. I think i've got it from him ;P. No offense to these basic dance music, i think continiously listening to the new songs, made me take distance from the basics, because of the lack of bass/melody etc. in the oldies. But no! nothing wrong with those old songs, that is where we started!\n\nKris McTwain – Stuck On Replay - DJ THT Remix Edit\n\nCc.K – Not Gonna Save the World - Cc.K. Mix Edit"
