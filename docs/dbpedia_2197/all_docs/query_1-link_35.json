        "text": "Great... again!\n\ncould use a little work at the start, but the middle of it is very good. I really like the style of your songs. found myself litening to this for 20 min. x.x\n\nThis was cool! :D\n\nThe beginning sounded ok. The beats weren't really that great. When the music really started to play and the rave rhythems started to come in, things got interesting. More beats and rhythems came in as well as raves. I remember hearing the original version of this audio a long time ago. Damn, that song was good. Loved the remix version of this audio. You did a good job! Overall, this audio was great and I enjoyed hearing this! Great Work Karaventus! :D\n\n-4.40 / 5.00 (+ 0.077) Voted 5!\n\n-Your 16th Voter!\n\n-Seamonky\n\nEhh...\n\nSorry man, I didn't really enjoy this, especially the beginning. I didn't like how it transferred into the next section. I feel as though the beat at the beginning was too fast for the rest of the song. Decent attempt though. =)"
