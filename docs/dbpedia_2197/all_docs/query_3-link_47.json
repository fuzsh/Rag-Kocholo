        "text": "Cascada de Flores celebrates 20 years of performing, educating and recording.\n\nThese multi-talented artists use traditional music, storytelling and dance to weave cultural lessons into bilingual and participatory programs which are highly praised for being heartwarming, humorous and engaging for all ages and backgrounds.\n\n\"The music from the various regions of Mexico is enchanting. You are excellent educators as well as consummate musicians and dancers.” Linda Covello, Community School of Music and the Arts, Mountain View, CA\n\nPrograms offered:\n\n1. El Abuelo (The Tree and the Donkey who loved to sing):\n\nThis bilingual, highly participatory and original story explodes with the song, ancient musical instruments, poly-rhythms, and sweet characters of Mexican traditional music and dance. The audience will sing like owls, dance like vultures and laugh with the humorous “Abuelo”. Improvisation, inventiveness, life cycles of nature, and the making of musical instruments and song are strong themes highlighted in this program.\n\nCurriculum Connection: Identity and Historical connections, Spanish, Indigenous & African Influences in Mexican/Latina Culture, Instrument Making, Music, Community Building, STEM, Storytelling, Creative Movement.\n\nTestimonies:\n\n“El Abuelo” is a beautiful gift to any child and parent. The bilingual storytelling is intelligently engaging, featuring charming characters full of artistry, music and fun. The kids eagerly completed el abuelito’s sentences and couldn’t wait to get on stage – which they did, several times.\" Leida Tolentino, UCSB MultiCultural Center\n\n2. ¡Aqui-les va... un cuento! - The Treasure of Aquiles\n\nA bilingual, participatory and original story told with music, dance and you!\n\nAquiles, a boy whose pueblo is barren of dance, music, and song, sets out on an adventure with his favorite morral (a bag filled with his favorite things). Along the way, he learns to sing from a bee, the joy of rhythm from a horse, and to dance from a flea. Aquiles’ morral becomes his treasure: filled with new found stories, songs, games, dances and rhymes which he brings back to his town.\n\nCome join him in his adventure! Sing, dance and play with Cascada de Flores. (Original songs by co-founder Jorge Liceaga) This free family show is in ENGLISH and SPANISH, and is highly participatory. All ages are welcome.\n\n“I really appreciate how music and dance were paired with a story and how rich the performance was. Cascada de Flores was wonderful at connecting literacy skills, like syllabication and oral storytelling, into the performance.” SF Bay Area Teacher\n\nThemes and Connections: Music, Vocal & Music exploration, Latin music styles, Latin rhythms, Rock and Roll, Musical instruments, song writing, storytelling, dance and movement, Spanish, Bilingual, literacy, animals\n\n3. Una Ofrenda Musical - A Musical Altar for our Muertos:\n\nA bilingual and participatory performance that explores the meaning of the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) with song, dance, personal stories and a large variety of traditional musical instruments. Students will remember and discover Day of the Dead traditions of celebrating lost loved ones while learning more about each other. A curriculum guide (with slides) focused on preparing a personal Ofrenda (offering on an altar).\n\nTestimonies from teachers:\n\n• It was fantastic how the performance included students seamlessly in the performance and let them get personal with the holiday in a safe and communal way. It surely was a memorable experience for them.\n\n• Storytelling through music gave our group an opportunity to understand death in a very spiritual, yet fun way.\n\n• The performers were very engaging and showcased their talents in a way that captivated everyone!\n\n• Calaveras was a way for student to connect popular rapping to Calaveras when they creatively make their own.\n\n4. Interactive concert of songs and dances in varying sizes:\n\nA collection of age-appropriate songs and dances from Latin American, presented to engage students either by having them perform rhythm, sing along, dance, or by teaching them about the instruments or cultural context of songs. From children’s songs with puppets and stories for early ages to more complicated musical patterns and cultural lessons for older ages, as well as special unit of Latin Music for Spanish Language learners at the High School Level."
