        "text": "3. Brian Anthony: “WhatsitgonnaB”\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54i3q6jmQg4\n\nEach of these videos finds a new way of blowing my mind, and this one does it by waiting until it is almost half over before revealing that it is in fact from an extremely bizarre source. Watch it up to about 1:04, with the big reveal at 1:15. It’s okay, I didn’t believe it either.\n\nBefore about 1:04, this is a normal dance video, but after 1:15 it is revealed this is actually from a “Music Inspired by the Film” remix project for Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. This movie was notable of course for:\n\nBeing an unapologetic, profitable piece of crap that was a sequel to an unapologetic, profitable piece of crap\n\nStarring Lawrence Fischburne without anybody knowing it starred Lawrence Fischburne\n\nWriting a case study in cowardice. They were too scared to take the chance of putting Galactus in a giant purple helmet because some people might not like it, so instead they made him a generic, nondescript sci fi villain, which nobody really liked.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a video of a song from a movie that included clips from that movie be so totally unconcerned with letting you know it is from a movie. But apparently, this whole Silver Surfer Techno Remix thing actually worked; supposedly it was quite popular overseas (where, interestingly enough, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer made more than half of its box office take).\n\nApparently, this is sort of what Brian Anthony does; in this research, I found he also did a remixed dance track for the sountrack to Dragonball: Abomination, the live-action Dragon Ball Z movie. So, good on him for haivng no qualms about totally disregarding the movies he is making songs for. He’ll live longer.\n\nThe Silver Surfer definitely works as a techno icon, I have to say. Despite the video not fitting in with the Fantastic Four sequel at all, the Silver Surfer fits pretty perfectly into the video. The song is about a guy propositioning somebody for sexual relations (“about” is used loosely). This guy is surrounded by women and doesn’t let on that he’s into dudes or anything, but he seems quite gay, and everyting moves really fast in a way that is kinetic but doesn’t carry narrative force. Brian Anthony is a lot like the Silver Surfer — if you stop and think about him too much, he doesn’t make any sense at all except as a gay icon, which he sort of isn’t for reasons that aren’t entirely clear except that maybe he isn’t quite famous enough. So, whatever, he does his thing for a few minutes and you move on to the next thing.\n\nOh, and except that Brian Anthony doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, while the Silver Surfer has a disambiguation page with at least five solid hits.\n\nDisambiguation? Ha, yeah right.\n\n4. Cascada: Miracle\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCzz4_FPbug\n\nFinally, a song we sort of recognize. Sort of. This song is from the album “Every Time We Touch,” by Cascada, which is fitting, because it is pretty much the same song as “Every Time We Touch,” by Cascada (except for being strictly worse). Here, for comparison:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6QDNC4jPs\n\nNow, “Miracle” is a bad song. I knew it from the first few lines.\n\nBoy meets girl\n\nYou were my dream, my world\n\nBut I was blind\n\nYou cheated on me from behind.\n\nI’m starting to get bored of people saying “Really? Really?” as a joke, but “Really? Really?” I don’t know exactly how you cheat on somebody from behind. I know how you cheat on somebody behind their back, but that’s mostly redundant anyway, because it’s pretty damn rare to cheat on someone to their face. But yeah, I guess if you get behind somebody back, and then you get ready to cheat on that person, but wait … no, move your knee it’s in the way. Ouch! Dammit! Sorry, sorry.\n\nSeriously, “You cheated from me from behind” is the worst line I’ve heard in a song in a long time. And of course, after this woman has not only been humiliated by her boyfriend, but has humiliated herself in front of everybody by choosing a really awkward way to describe it, what is the song about? Why, getting him back of course! What did you think it was about?\n\nSigh.\n\nWhy do so many songs give such terrible, terrible relationship advice? Somebody should sue these people.\n\nThis song reminds me a lot of one of the worst relationship songs of all time, because it not only gives women terrible ideas about how to conduct relationships, but it encourages the absolute worst in men by promoting a dangerous counterfactual fantasy — the best “stalker-/ephebophiliac-encouragement” song not made by the Police (who made several), “Sometimes” by Britney Spears:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0bPrt69rag&ob=av2e\n\nSometimes I run\n\nSometimes I hide\n\nSometimes I’m scared of you\n\nBut all I really want is to hold you tight\n\nTreat you right\n\nBe with you day and night.\n\nBaby all I need is time.\n\nOkay, maybe I heard this song as more sinister than it was intended, but I posit that all Britney Spears music is by design more sinister than it lets on – it’s part of the aesthetic. I mean, have you listened to Slave 4 U lately? No? Just me then. Okay. Back to Cascada.\n\nCascada’s song is full of codependent nonsense. It’s addressed to the guy who cheated on her, asking him for a miracle, which, um, puts him on a bit of a pedestal, to say the least. Then it rhymes “miracle” with “be your girl” which is just embarrassing. Then it tries to entice the guy by saying he should give her a chance to see if he was made for her. This of course is not information that the guy would generally be interested in knowing – he’d be far more interested if she was made for him. Her beliefs about what he is destined to do are not something he cares very much about, because he just cheated on her.\n\nAlso, this whole exercise is going toward confirming a fundamentally misled idea of how this relationship works – she is using her love, her adoration for this guy as proof that the relationship must continue. She is with him day and night, she really really loves him, all this other stuff – but the reason the relationship has to stop is because the guy cheated on her, “from behind,” no less! She then says “One day you’ll see, it can happen to me” — using her own desperation and envy of other women in an attempt to persuade her cheating boyfriend to take her back. None of the supporting arguments Cascada is providing are relevant to the question at hand.\n\nPlus, whenever it gets back to the chorus, I’m almost certain it’s going to jump into “But every time we touch, I get this feeling …” and then it’s disappointing because this is the inferior Cascada song, and life is too short for inferior Cascada songs.\n\n5. Frederick Ford: “Turn My World Around”\n\nOkay guys, prepare yourselves. We’re going back to Jacinta country. And I don’t mean Austin or Australia. Here be dragons.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJi-mN1KSdM\n\nThis video leaves me kind of speechless. It may be one of the worst music videos ever made.\n\nIf “Frederick Ford” sounds like a porn name, it’s because, judging from the YouTube comments, he used to do porn, or still does it. And I can’t/don’t want to do any research on him, because the sites you get when you google him are blocked on this computer for being pornography. So, you know what, I’m going to not do any research on this rat-lookin’ dude.\n\nI mean, I want him to succeed and everything, because who doesn’t love parachutes or whatever, but, to quote one of the YouTube comments:\n\n“worst thing ive ever seen in my life. someone needs to burn that rotating box ”\n\nYou may wonder why I kept watching these videos. Well, for one thing, they were bizarre and hilarious — always unexpected. Some of them were even pretty good. For another, I was running pretty hard, and the uptempo music was good to keep the pace up. For a third, well, I did it for you guys. And for a fourth, the likelihood of finding something worse if I changed the channel was pretty high. Watching commercials while running on a treadmill sucks. So, Excelsior!\n\n6. Lasgo: “Out of My Mind”\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08yLol56ODg\n\nThe fonts in this video are what convinced me to actually follow through and write this thing, because they are awesome. If they gave an award for best use of fonts in a music video, this should win all of them. Maybe putting the fonts next to postmodern interpretations of classic sex symbols also got my Overthinking going. You’ve got the cool bubbly sanserif retro-even-for-the-80s font for the pink microphone costume, the Blade Runner / Star Trek TNG font for the road race costume, the broader, more elegant but still sci-fi white font for the elegantly overwrought robo-costume, the breezy cursive-inspired sanserif for the angel costume, the blocky serif outline font for the boxer costume (which doesn’t show up until late in the video), and the most obliquely referenced font, which is the actual “Lasgo” font on the packaging for the doll.\n\nThere are three angles at play in this video – there’s the fonts, the costumes (or themes) and the colors. They all come in sets – the racecar girl is always red and always has the Blade Runner / TNG font, but there are parts of the video where the text really jumps out, or the costumes really jump out, or the colors are oscillated quickly enough that the rest recedes.\n\nThis plays off the dance aesthetic that informs a lot of these videos – this is music that speaks to an altered state of consciousness where people respond to really blown-out symbols – where things are iconic, motivations are boiled down, and subtletly is lost in the bass and the lights. Everything strives for the iconic. Lasgo uses this as a platform for discussing modes of femininity – not in a particularly original way, but with cool design and nice execution. Of course, all the women are the same person in different costumes. This speaks to the idea that notions of “woman” are reductive, reflecting rather than a signification of a single person a mere facet or aspect of what that person might project when viewed from a particular vantage point. Same woman, different clothes. Same words, different fonts. Form and function are linked, though — race car girl is a different character than angel girl, and “love” means different things in the different fonts."
