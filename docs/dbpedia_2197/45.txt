The original name "Cascade" can be found on some older CDs & records, such as first editions of the hit song "Miracle". This was soon changed due to legal conflicts. The voice behind the Cascada Project is Natalie Horler aka "Cascada" and is accompanied by 2 DJ/producers, Yanou and DJ Manian whom create the beats & melodies.
