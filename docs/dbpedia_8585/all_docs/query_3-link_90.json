Understanding the different types of coverages can help you find the right car insurance policy for your needs and budget. Learn about types of auto insurance coverage with GEICO.\n\nWhat is car insurance?\n\nCar insurance helps provide financial protection for you, your family, other passengers, and your vehicle. You can choose the amount of protection by selecting your coverages and limits. An auto insurance policy can provide coverage for:\n\nAccidents\n\nLiability\n\nMedical expenses\n\nProperty\n\nVehicles\n\nUnderstanding Your Auto Insurance\n\nYour auto insurance policy consists of multiple coverages that provide protection in different situations involving your vehicle. Coverages have different limits and may have deductibles. Specific coverages and limits may also be required by a lienholder or lender.\n\nTo better understand your policy, there are several insurance terms you should know:\n\nCoverage: protection and benefits provided to you\n\nLimits: maximum amount of protection for a specific coverage\n\nPolicy: contract between you and your insurance company\n\nPremium: price of your insurance policy\n\nDeductible: portion you pay out of pocket, if you file a claim\n\nWhen you compare car insurance rates, make sure they're for the same coverages, deductibles, and limits. Shopping for car insurance is easy and fast with GEICO. Learn more about how auto insurance rates are determined.\n\nTypes of Car Insurance Coverage\n\nFirst, let us clarify that there's no such thing as \"full coverage.\" Some people may say \"full coverage\" means the minimum liability coverages for their state, comprehensive coverage and collision coverage. But it could also mean something else. Ultimately, you should choose the coverages that are right for you. \"Full coverage\" is an insurance myth.\n\nWhat are the different types of coverages? Auto insurance includes liability coverages, vehicle coverages, coverages for yourself, and other optional coverages.*\n\nLiability Coverages\n\nLiability Coverages include:\n\nBodily Injury liability: pays damages for bodily injury or death resulting from an accident for which you are at fault\n\nProperty Damage liability: pays for damage to someone else's property resulting from an accident for which you are at fault\n\nFor serious accidents, you want enough insurance to cover a judgment against you in a lawsuit without jeopardizing your personal assets. Therefore, it's a good idea to have the same level of bodily injury coverage for all your cars. You may also want to consider an umbrella policy which provides additional coverage for more serious accidents and lawsuits.\n\nMedical Coverages\n\nMedical Payments coverage: may pay medical expenses related to a car accident\n\nPersonal Injury Protection coverage: may pay for your medical treatment, lost wages, or other accident-related expenses regardless of who caused the accident\n\nUninsured Motorist Coverages\n\nUninsured Motorist coverage: may help compensate you for your injuries or property damage caused by a driver without insurance\n\nUnderinsured Motorist coverage: can protect you from at-fault drivers with insufficient insurance coverage to pay your claim\n\nVehicle Coverages\n\nCollision coverage: may pay for damage to your car when it hits, or is hit by, another vehicle or other object\n\nComprehensive coverage: may pay for damage to your car from theft, vandalism, flood, fire or other covered losses\n\nYou may be able to lower your premium if you select a higher deductible. If you have an older vehicle you may want to consider whether you need these coverages as they are normally limited to the cash value of your car.\n\nAdditional Auto Insurance Coverages\n\nEmergency Road Service\n\nRental Reimbursement\n\nMechanical Breakdown Insurance\n\nThere's a lot to learn about auto insurance coverages. If you have questions, contact our licensed insurance agents at (800) 861-8380.\n\nHow much car insurance do I need?\n\nThe right amount of auto insurance coverage comes down to your needs, budget, and state requirements. Some things to keep in mind when choosing your coverage are:\n\nWhich coverages and limits does my state require for all drivers?\n\nDoes my lienholder have coverage requirements?\n\nDo I need to protect any other assets, such as my home?\n\nHow much can I afford to pay out of pocket at any given time?\n\nWhat is my vehicle worth now?\n\nWe recommend checking your state insurance minimums and reviewing all coverage options to make sure you have the right coverage. Our Coverage Calculator can help you find the right amount of coverage and the right deductible to fit your budget.\n\nWhy should I buy my auto insurance from GEICO?\n\nFive reasons to buy an auto insurance policy from GEICO:"
