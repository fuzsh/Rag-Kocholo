        "text": "@hansen_m has most of our software updates for the Mac fully automated through AutoPkg and a processor that helps it create BigFix tasks. Most of his work is open source.\n\nAutoPkg runs nightly and checks if new software has been released from vendors through download recipes, most of which are already available on GitHub for most products. Then a recipe that knows how to take that particular product and put it into a BigFix task is run, and the final task is placed into the BigFix Console automatically. A separate job runs and finds all the newly created tasks and pushes them out to our test machines automatically. We validate the results and then publish them internally to our organization.\n\nNow @hansen_m is using AutoPkg to do the same with Windows software.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.bigfix.me/analysis/details/2994767\n\nVery cool! Shame you can’t share your work, I’d love to collaborate on this stuff!\n\nBy its nature IEM doesn’t make it incredibly easy to share content, but I’m working on a few ideas to make that easier. Another huge benefit for us is the fact that all this work is in source control management, so we can easily track changes to fixlets/tasks and use more of a devops style approach to systems management."
