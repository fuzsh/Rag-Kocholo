        "text": "This is a list of notable software package management systems, categorized first by package format (binary, source code, hybrid) and then by operating system family.[1]\n\nThe following package management systems distribute apps in binary package form; i.e., all apps are compiled and ready to be installed and use.\n\ndpkg: Originally used by Debian and now by Ubuntu. Uses the .deb format and was the first to have a widely known dependency resolution tool, APT. The ncurses-based front-end for APT, aptitude, is also a popular package manager for Debian-based systems;\n\nEntropy: Used by and created for Sabayon Linux. It works with binary packages that are bzip2-compressed tar archives (file extension: .tbz2), that are created using Entropy itself, from tbz2 binaries produced by Portage: From ebuilds, a type of specialized shell script;\n\nFlatpak: A containerized/sandboxed packaging format previously known as xdg-app;\n\nGNU Guix: Used by the GNU System. It is based on the Nix package manager with Guile Scheme APIs and specializes in providing exclusively free software;\n\nHomebrew: a port of the MacOS package manager of the same name (see below), formerly referred to as 'Linuxbrew';\n\nipkg: A dpkg-inspired, very lightweight system targeted at storage-constrained Linux systems such as embedded devices and handheld computers.

Compatible with Slackware package management tools;\n\nNix package manager: Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix-like systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments;\n\nOpenPKG: Cross-platform package management system based on RPM Package Manager;\n\nopkg: Fork of ipkg lightweight package management intended for use on embedded Linux devices;\n\nPacman: Used in Arch Linux, Frugalware and DeLi Linux. Its binary package format is a compressed tar archive (default file extension: .pkg.tar.zst) built using the makepkg utility (which comes bundled with pacman) and a specialized type of shell script called a PKGBUILD;\n\nPETget: Used by Puppy Linux;\n\nPISI: Stands for \"Packages Installed Successfully as Intended\". Pisi package manager is used by Pisi Linux.[2] Pardus used to use Pisi, but migrated to APT in 2013;[3]\n\npkgsrc: A cross-platform package manager, with binary packages provided for Enterprise Linux, macOS and SmartOS by Joyent and other vendors;\n\nPortage: A package management system ran by the emerge command, originally created for and used by Gentoo Linux;\n\nRPM Package Manager: Created by Red Hat.

Each PBI is self-contained and uses de-duplicated private dependencies to avoid version conflicts. An autobuild system tracks the FreeBSD ports collection and generates new PBIs daily. PC-BSD also uses the FreeBSD pkg binary package system; new packages are built approximately every two weeks from both a stable and rolling release branch of the FreeBSD ports tree.\n\nImage Packaging System (IPS, also known as \"pkg(5)\"): Used by Solaris, OpenSolaris and Illumos distributions like OpenIndiana and OmniOS;\n\npkgsrc: SmartOS, OS distribution of Illumos from Joyent uses pkgsrc, that also can be bootstrapped to use on OpenIndiana;[6]\n\nOpenCSW: Community supported collection of packages in SysV format for SunOS 5.8-5.11 (Solaris 8-11);\n\nOpenPKG: Cross-platform package management system based on RPM Package Manager.\n\nApp Store: Official app store for iOS apps;\n\nCydia: Frontend to a port of APT.

Now superseded by Microsoft Store;\n\nSMP/E.\n\nThe following package management systems distribute the source code of their apps. Either the user must know how to compile the packages, or they come with a script that automates the compilation process. For example, in GoboLinux a recipe file contains information on how to download, unpack, compile and install a package using its Compile tool. In both cases, the user must provide the computing power and time needed to compile the app, and is legally responsible for the consequences of compiling the package.\n\nFreeBSD Ports is an original implementation of source based software management system commonly referred to as Ports collection. It gave way and inspired many others systems;\n\nOpenBSD ports is a Perl based reimplementation of ports collection;\n\nABS is used by Arch Linux to automate binary packages building from source or even other binary archives, with automatic download and dependency checking;\n\napt-build is used by distributions which use deb packages, allowing automatic compiling and installation of software in a deb source repository;\n\nSorcery is Sourcemage GNU/Linux's bash based package management program that automatically downloads software from their original site and compiles and installs it on the local machine;\n\nFink, for OS X, derives partially from dpkg/apt and partially from ports;\n\nMacPorts, formerly called DarwinPorts, originated from the OpenDarwin project;\n\nHomebrew, with close Git integration;\n\npkgsrc can be used to install software directly from source-code, or to use the binary packages provided by several independent vendors.\n\nvcpkg:[7] A Microsoft C++ package manager for Windows, Linux and MacOS.\n\nNix package manager: Package manager that manages software in a purely functional way, featuring multi-user support, atomic upgrades and rollbacks. Allows multiple versions or variants of a software to be installed at the same time. It has support for macOS and is cross-distribution in its Linux support;\n\nPortage and emerge are used by Gentoo Linux, Funtoo Linux, and Sabayon Linux. It is inspired by the BSD ports system and uses text based \"ebuilds\" to automatically download, customize, build, and update packages from source code. It has automatic dependency checking and allows multiple versions of a software package to be installed into different \"slots\" on the same system. Portage also employs \"use flags\" to allow the user to fully customize a software build to suit the needs of their platform in an automated fashion. While source code distribution and customization is the preferred methodology, some larger packages that would take many hours to compile on a typical desktop computer are also offered as pre-compiled binaries in order to ease installation;\n\nUpkg: Package management and build system based on Mono and XML specifications. Used by paldo and previously by ExTiX Linux;\n\nMacPorts (for OS X);\n\nNetBSD's pkgsrc works on several Unix-like operating systems, with regular binary packages for macOS and Linux provided by multiple independent vendors;\n\nCollective Knowledge Framework is a cross-platform package and workflow framework with JSON API that can download binary packages or build them from sources for Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android platforms.[8]\n\nThe following unify package management for several or all Linux and sometimes Unix variants. These, too, are based on the concept of a recipe file.\n\nAppImage (previously klik and PortableLinuxApps) aims to provide an easy way to get software packages for most major distributions without the dependency problems so common in many other package formats.\n\nAutopackage uses .package files.\n\nPackageKit is a set of utilities and libraries for creating applications that can manage packages across multiple package managers using back-ends to call the correct program.\n\nPackage management systems geared toward developing and distributing video games.\n\nSteam: A cross-platform video game distribution, licensing and social gameplay platform, developed and maintained by Valve.
