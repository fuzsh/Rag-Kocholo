        "text": "I’ve been an avid Rhino user for several years now, having used it on both Windows and now primarily on Mac. Lately, though, I’m getting increasingly frustrated by the many long-standing issues that seem like they should have been fixed long ago. And having recently gotten into using Blender, I’m even more frustrated that a $1000 software with an additional charge for each upgrade seems to be so far behind a free and open source project.\n\nThe differences between the Mac and Windows version are mind-boggling to me, and frankly it verges on a rip-off that Mac users pay the same yet receive a distinctly less-powerful and less user-friendly piece of software. The reason I felt compelled to write this was discovering today that editing toolbars and the pop-up menu is not possible in Mac, which in my opinion severely cripples the ability to increase productivity with customization on the Mac version. Many other gripes are summed up nicely here, such as Osnap inconsistencies, and of course the relatively long list of commands that still are not available on Mac, with no explanation as to why they cannot/have not been ported. The Mac vs. Windows feature comparison page is an absolute joke, none of the tangible differences are indicated here, only a vague indication that plugins and developer tools are less robust and that the niche function of worksessions isn’t available. This feels particularly insidious, as an unsuspecting person would likely conclude that the Mac version is virtually the same and proceed to buy it after viewing that page, only to discover its limitations after they have committed to the Mac ecosystem.\n\nWhat is promising is that in the forum topic I linked previously there is an indication that these things will be remedied in Rhino 8, however many of them seem like they should never have been issues in the first place.\n\nJohn Brock said in the linked forum post:\n\nThe Mac and Windows U/I are different by design.\n\nIt was decided long ago for Mac users would never use a Windows application, or a Windows application that just ran on the Mac, it would be a bad decision. This turned out to be largely true.\n\nSince then, there seems to be some push back from people like yourself.\n\nWho decided this? Was there any say by paying customers? By what metric can you conclude it turned out to be largely true? There are plenty of applications that are “windows applications that just ran on the Mac”, the entire Microsoft office suite is a great example and it is still the standard for office work whether you use Windows or a Mac, with very little difference in UI beyond the typical placing of drop down menus in the system menubar on Mac.\n\nThe fixes within Rhino 8 also cannot come fast enough. The development pace of Rhino seems incredibly sluggish compared to Blender. Blender managed to entirely rewrite it’s core render engine and provide support for Metal and M1 macs within 2 years of M1 being announced. When I first downloaded blender in early 2021, it did not support Metal GPU rendering on my AMD5500M, when I revisited it in mid 2022 I was greeted with an entirely overhauled render engine that fully functioned with Metal out of the box, not to mention an incredibly powerful node system that is applied to almost every aspect of Blender, and many other new features. Rhino 8 with M1 support (and supposed UI unification) is still WIP, and from what I can tell it is still solidly in the WIP phase, 2 years after it began. I’m no longer a student, so if I want a fully functioning Mac product I will likely have to pony up $600.\n\nThe starkness of these differences combined with Rhino now using Cycles (in an incredibly unintuitive and slow implementation) for some rendering is laughably ironic. Of course Cycles is open-source and it is important that anyone can use open-source software regardless of corporate status, but it definitely doesn’t feel good to know that the state of Rhino development is such that my money is going towards a crippled implementation of a render engine that in it’s native (free) environment is much more powerful. I sure hope McNeel contributes to the Blender Development Fund, but unless their contributions are hidden it does not look like they do.\n\nThis all looks like a lot of complaining, because it is, but the reason I’m saying any of this at all is because I think Rhino is one of the best softwares for 3D modelling, nothing can really compare to the full breadth of work that can be down with it, especially if you include grasshopper. But there are some pretty major sore spots that, in my opinion, but Rhino at risk of falling far behind other software, both paid and free, and I don’t want that to happen.\n\nI am of course, not a developer, nor do I have anywhere near the amount of experience in 3D software as the people at McNeel. I’m totally open to having my naivete pointed out, and I’m curious what perspectives other people have on the state of Rhino development, regarding the Mac version or otherwise. The comparison to Blender isn’t entirely fair, as Blender has a much larger user base. This is where open-source gets it’s strength though. I’m also aware the Rhino is one of the few professional software packages that is still on a one-time purchase scheme, as opposed to a subscription service. I appreciate that but it seems like that puts it in an odd niche between the widespread development and financial support of an open-source project, and the high-end support of a professional product funded by thousands of dollars a year in subscriptions. Rhino going open-source would be a dream come true in my opinion, but I’m not imagining that that is a remote possibility. My hope is that the long-term strategy for Rhino takes some notes from open-source development, including platform-agnosticism, increased transparency in decision making, a more streamlined and rapid development cycle, and further inclusion of what is indeed a vibrant community of users and developers.\n\nYou obviously haven’t spent any appreciable time in Autocad for window vs mac.\n\nNow autodesk uses the exact licensing model you champion, charge a ludicrous amount for either platform with show stopping fatal bugs, some of which have been there for so long they border on being of legal drinking age in all 50 states.\n\nUntil you’ve attempted to do any relatively simple Boolean operations in AutoCad, then have left your desk, got lunch, read a decent chunk of War and Peace, and did your taxes while waiting for it to complete only to have the memory leak from hell surface and lock up your entire machine to the point where a 3 finger salute won’t fix it and then have to cold power your box (and as a result losing whatever work you might have had open in other apps in the process), you really can’t appreciate the relative solidity of the Rhino platform.\n\nHell Rhino’s first beta test release was infinitely more solid than any Autocad “Release” I’ve ever dealt with. About the only feature in AC that is fairly solid is it’s crash recovery, probably because that’s it’s most used feature.\n\nI recently spent 4 years at a job where the only platform that the company supported was AC and those were the most miserable years of my career. Thank God for Covid layoffs, as they did me a huge service.\n\nAs one who’s had to use both for a good decade now on both platforms I’d dare say the UI differences in Rhino between the platforms, while valid, aren’t nearly as miserable is bouncing back and forth between AC Mac and Windows.\n\nAt least when I do that in Rhino I know that what work I have will be present in either platform, with no hidden “goodies” like in AC where for no particular reason opening a windows AC file in Mac will occasionally scramble your layers and the objects on them as well as the entire layer definition beyond recognition.\n\nOr the “whoops we reset your scale definition at the file level and applied it as object attributes which now requires you to manually select each item, one at a time and fix the scale” bug (been there for oh about 4 years now).\n\nOr how about the “you didn’t really expect us to keep track of your x-ref’s relative states when you moved that set of nested directories onto a shared network drive did you” which will break entire document sets and require you to spend hours fixing them. And that bug’s been there oh, for about 10 years now.\n\nAnd in exchange for those and innumerable other goodies in the AC platform you get to pay an absolutely absurd annual “subscription with support” fee, and that “support’ comes with it uh…… Nothing.\n\nYou can report bugs till the cows come home and hear crickets, or at best they’ll point you to some bit of embedded online help that hasn’t had it’s dialog pictures updated since god only knows what ancient rev when that feature was introduced.\n\nIf you can’t figure out how something works? The documentation is more or less useless. Best hope that somebody in a non AC forum has answered it, because if you raise it in the AD forum you might be on social security before anybody answers, if at all.\n\nThe relative arrogance of the Autocad developers is the stuff of legend.\n\n(And to be fair that seems to be an AC only thing. The Fusion360 and Inventor folks are actually pretty responsive).\n\nAs far as feature discrepancy between platforms? Sure thats there, and are there gaps? Yeah.\n\nHowever as the McKneel folks have pointed out, some of those are based in stuff thats got a host OS dependency, which sucks if you’ve done any software development work at all, just keeping up with Microsoft’s “New Technology De Jour which we won’t actually fix any bugs in but replace it with another New Technology De Jour in a couple years”. Same thing but in a different way in Apple Land. This makes it really difficult to implement certain things reliably, let alone in a cross platform fashion.\n\nNow I’ve been using Cad and 3D software probably since before you were born, and have ran the gauntlet of these things.\n\nI”ve used more 3d modeling packages that have long since vanished from the ecosphere than I can count. I’ve beta and in some cases alpha tested a number of these.\n\nAnd having done a fair bit of software development work over the years, I can say this much. CAD and 3D applications are quite possibly one of the most challenging types of software to create. The required skill sets go well beyond those that any other application development requires. You can’t just know how to code for a given platform, you have to have an innate understanding of very complex math, be able to do matrix and vector math in your head and juggle notions of terms that most people have never heard of (I guaranty that if you use the term Quaternion in a sentence in a public gathering, most present will think you’re from some other planet).\n\nSo the folks that do this work are pretty special. And at most other places, these devs are essentially kept behind locked doors that no one has access to. Getting someone at one of these places to answer a question is pretty much unbotainium.\n\nAnd over the years? I’ve never EVER seen a development team that’s a fraction as approachable as the McNeel folks are. You sure as hell won’t find any of the developers hanging out in the user forums, answering questions, tossing up example files of how to do specific things, and integrating to the degree they do here with any other platform I’ve ever seen or used, including many of the Uber big players like SolidWorks, ProE and Catia, and any one of those platforms annual subscription costs orders of magnitude more than the $700 price you are wingeing about.\n\nBeing a Mac user by choice, I’m just tickled pink that McN first introduced a Mac version (back at V5) at a time when most software outfits were abandoning the platform altogether. After years of fighting with AC mac (which in those days was more or less utterly unusable for anything vaguely approximating production work) and having nursed along the final build of EI’s Modeler after it went defunct, having an actual workable nurbs CAD platform on the Mac that actually worked and didn’t cost 5 digits to license was an absolute godsend.\n\nAnd about “blender”.\n\nSure it’s open source\n\nSure it’s free.\n\nSure it’s a lot of things.\n\nAnd I’ve used it, specifically for rendering, until Apple nuked support for NVidia’s CUDA drivers and that was the end of that.\n\nAnd this was long before Pascal and crew had the spiffy little import export module and you had to bring stuff in as OBJ’s and spend a friggin eternity fixing orientations, and a raft of other crap just to get a render out.\n\nIs cycles a decent renderer? Yah, sorta. Can you get good results with it? Yeah if you spend a ton of time learning the quirks and all that. Is it the be all and end all?\n\nNo, not even close.\n\nAnd FWIW, Blender has a UI and underlying methodology that only a serious masochist would pick as a tool of choice in a professional environment.\n\nYou sure dont’ see any major production houses using it for any real work, and there’s a good reason for that.\n\nI get that there’s the whole sub culture of folks out there doing all kinds of clever stuff in blender. And I’ve actually got some decent stuff out of it, but at a cost in time and “farting around factor” that a real production house wouldn’t sit still for.\n\nNow granted, these days I don’t even do anim and rendering work as the vast majority of my Cad work these days is either production drawings or stuff that gets exported for FDM production.\n\nI can’t speak to the M1 issue as I don’t have an M1 yet specifically because I know Rhino’s not quite there yet.\n\nI’ll give you that it’d be nice if it was, but it’s not. And bear in mind the vast majority of apps that DO run on a M1 are running under Rosetta and their performance is acceptable simply because the aren’t doing what Rhino does. Word and Excel? Not exactly challenging apps from a CPU and GPU standpoint.\n\nIs there stuff that could be improved? Sure. Some notion of drawing sets would be nice, and a full implementation of Autocad’s dynamic blocks would allow me to kiss that god awful nightmare of a platform good bye forever. However I’m a pragmatist. I know I’m not the only one with wish lists. I’m also old enough to realize my particular wish list may not be the same as others, let alone in the majority.\n\nBut as you’re apparently fresh outta college, and haven’t actually had to live in the real world where we gotta get stuff done day in and day out to meet real world deadlines and when there’s some aspect in your tool that you rely on to meet said deadlines with, that either you haven’t used that much or is responding different than what you’d expect, I’ll take the comparatively nearly instantly responsive folks at McNeel over the extended middle finger I might (or more often might not) get back get from AutoDesk a few weeks if not months later (at 2-3x the price each and every year) any day.\n\nTrue, Blender is a bit of an outlier. But I don’t think I implied that Blender is ‘sticking it to the man’, but I also don’t think it is anywhere near the territory of Adobe. Apple being a patron-level supporter of the Blender Foundation is hardly going to increase the market share of the Mac at all, let alone get it to levels that could be considered monopolization. Blender is never going to be Mac-specific, so the relatively (for Apple) small amount of money that Apple forks over to Blender provides a relatively higher value to individuals with Macs than it does Apple.\n\nThat’s pretty different than Adobe sitting on their laurels, charging ludicrous prices, and leaving their software riddled with bugs and performance issues because they have near-complete monopoly.\n\nI would say you need to be just as much of a pro, if not more, to model efficiently in Rhino. You need to create your own list of keystrokes mapped to commands and memorize those if you don’t want to stop and type everything into the command line every 10 seconds. It’s also true that Blender and Rhino fill different niches, I’m not comparing the software features directly here, just the overall level of development and philosophy. You’d have to be a serious masochist to want to do any serious rendering/texturing work with Rhino as well…even with the new render engine in V7.\n\nBlender has changed a lot, if you haven’t taken a look in awhile I would say it’s worth it to revisit. In my opinion the UI is very intuitive once you understand the philosophy behind it. Everything is a series of windows that can be set to virtually any tool panel, editor, or viewport, and they can be easily split vertically or horizontally. There are several default workspaces that are just modifications of this window system, for instance the shading workspace splits the default workspace into 4 panels, showing you a 3D viewport, a shader editor, a file manager, and an image editor. The UV editing workspace splits it into a 3D viewport and a UV editor. There isn’t anything baked into these workspaces, they could all be created by hand if you wanted. And of course you can make and save your own workspaces very easily for whatever your workflow is. There are various ‘modes’ like Edit Mode (similar to PointsOn in Rhino if you aren’t familiar) that can be accessed in any 3D viewport in any workspace.\n\nThis sort of modularity is something I would LOVE to see in Rhino, it is far more intuitive than the current viewport splitting system, and I think it would manage the diversity of workflows in Rhino better. You could have a drafting workspace that sets one Top viewport, shows you the layers panel, puts the drafting tool palette front-and-center. Or a rendering workspace that shows you the materials, UV, texture mapping, etc alongside a Named Viewport. Modelling workspaces could turn PointsOn automatically, Layer States could be assigned to each workspace which would make them much more useful in my opinion, I could go on.\n\nThis could all be set up quickly by the user for their needs, which vary widely between the different fields Rhino is used in, eg. architecture vs. product design.\n\nAs someone in the architecture field, even just having a drafting workspace set up to show me a top view and turn off everything but the layers with dimensions and plan drawings would be incredibly time/headache saving. Being able to switch between that and a typical modelling workspace (with OneView on by default perhaps?) with a single click would be fantastic.\n\nI understand that, that is what I have done actually and I’m glad it is that way. I should have worded my original post differently, the issue would arise if someone was contemplating buying a Mac and was persuaded to do so by the comparison page thinking that Rhino would be almost the same.\n\nThat’s a good point, I think I can forget how bad cross-platform support used to be (and still is in some cases) compared to where it seems to be going now.\n\nFair enough, I’m glad that Rhino 8 is heading in that direction. Despite my wingeing I am appreciative of the work you do.\n\nI largely agree, I appreciate the evolutionary approach to Rhino. I guess I’m just wondering if there is a way to maintain that evolution without creating bloatware. I think there is but indeed that will require even more time."
