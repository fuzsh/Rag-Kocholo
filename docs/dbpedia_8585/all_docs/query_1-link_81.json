        "text": "I did that. The problem was, for some reason, everything that used Python didnt’ work . Aside of that it worked OK. I use Ubuntu. They now have an updated version of Blender in the repositories. But the only version they had for a long time was 2.34 .\n\nWhen I installed Blender from the repositories, I checked where it had placed the files. Blender was all over the place! /usr/bin, /usr/lib , /usr/whatever. Personally I dont’t find it a very organized way to place the files. Maybe a linux guru can answer me why , since I am a relatively newbie, trying to kick the windows habit\n\nNow I use the latest version of Blender, but when the next update comes, it would be interesting to see packaged with autpopackage, because I never had problems installing programs with autopackage in several linux distros I tried.\n\nCheers\n\nEduardo\n\nI never heard of autopackager. I just checked the site and that looks like a really useful piece of software. :o I use gentoo at the moment so I don’t need it now but it’ll really come in useful when I change.\n\nThanks for the heads up.\n\nMr Wonka"
