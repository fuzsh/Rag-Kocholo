For example, after running the following in the shell, the code shown below works, but the red wiggle is still visible:\n\npip uninstall anvil pip uninstall anvil-uplink pip install anvil-uplink\n\nExpected vs Current Behavior:\n\nThe correct package should be installed.\n\nThe red wiggle should disappear when the import succeeds.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nCreate a new python repl, add the following code and run:\n\nimport anvil import anvil.server print(anvil) print(anvil.server)\n\nBug appears at this link: https://replit.com/@stenci/InbornWealthyGigabyte#main.py\n\nBrowser/OS/Device: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\n\nReplit Profile: https://replit.com/@stenci\n\nHello, auto-importing is an intended feature of UPM (Universal Package Manager). In python specifically, these guessed imports may be wrong, so you should tell it which package to import.\n\nExample:\n\nimport pygame #upm package(pygame-ce)\n\nRelated:\n\nIt is usually best to disable import guessing in the packager configuration in .replit file, but unfortunately this is currently broken because of a bug."
