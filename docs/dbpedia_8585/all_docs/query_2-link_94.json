        "text": "In my Wednesday session for MacSysAdmin 2020 Online – “This One Goes to 11” – (http://macsysadmin.se/program/program.html) I talk about the implications of macOS Big Sur’s version numbering.\n\nI didn’t talk in too much detail about how that might affect Munki admins specifically, and I’ll remedy that here.\n\nContinue reading “This One Goes to 11: macOS version comparisons and Munki” →\n\nIn my Wednesday session for MacSysAdmin 2020 Online, I talk a bit about the dual-versioning of macOS Big Sur. Since the talk was recorded and submitted a few weeks ago, some things have changed!\n\nWhen I recorded the presentation, Big Sur was on beta 6. In that version of Big Sur, the platform module in the bundled Python reported Big Sur’s version as 11.0:\n\n# sw_vers ProductName: macOS ProductVersion: 11.0 BuildVersion: 20A5364e # /usr/bin/python WARNING: Python 2.7 is not recommended. This version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS will not include Python 2.7. Instead, it is recommended that you transition to using 'python3' from within Terminal. Python 2.7.16 (default, Aug 24 2020, 12:22:49) [GCC Apple LLVM 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.30.1) [+internal-os, ptrauth-isa=sign+stri on darwin Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> import platform >>> platform.mac_ver() ('11.0', ('', '', ''), 'x86_64')\n\nIn Big Sur beta 9, that behavior changed:\n\nContinue reading “MacSysAdmin 2020 update: This One Goes to 11” →\n\nMacSysAdmin is online this year and open to everyone!\n\nhttp://macsysadmin.se/program/program.html\n\nEach day will have some great new presentations from a wide array of speakers. I have a presentation today (Tuesday) and ones on Wednesday and Friday as well. There are also some great presentations from the archives!\n\nCheck here tomorrow for some updates and expansions for my Wednesday presentation.\n\nHere’s a list of resources for Mac admins converting their scripts from Python 2 to Python 3.\n\nPython 3 framework\n\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ (generic/stock framework from python.org)\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2amjix194163li6/Python3.framework.zip?dl=0\n\n(relocatable framework with pip, PyObjC, xattr, and six pre-installed)\n\npython-modernize\n\nhttps://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\npylint\n\nhttps://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nInstall python-modernize and pylint using pip:\n\npip install modernize pip install pylint\n\n-or-\n\nApple Installer pkg containing python-modernize and pylint:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3e4gxs4fx4s05q9/py3portingtools-1.0.pkg?dl=0\n\nsix\n\nhttps://six.readthedocs.io\n\nsix is installed as part of Apple’s Python 2.7 install; if you download the relocatable Python 3 framework from the link above, it also includes (a newer version of) six.\n\nThe Conservative Python 3 Porting Guide\n\nhttps://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\nCheat Sheet: Writing Python 2-3 compatible code\n\nhttps://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html\n\nOne case-study\n\nhttps://medium.com/@boxed/moving-a-large-and-old-codebase-to-python3-33a5a13f8c99\n\nhttps://github.com/munki/munki/releases/tag/v4.0.0RC1\n\nThis is a release candidate of Munki 4.0, a major architectural change to the Munki tools.\n\nMunki 4 removes the dependency on Apple’s Python, and includes its own copy of Python 3.7.4.\n\nFunctionality is intended to be identical to Munki 3.6.4.\n\nSee Introduction to Munki 4 for more information on the architectural changes.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\nIf you use AutoPkg, do not use the munkitools3.munki recipe to import this release, as it will not import the new embedded Python package and any clients upgraded with the results will be broken.\n\nA new munkitools4.munki recipe is available in the AutoPkg recipes repo.\n\nPrevious betas for this code base were numbered as 3.7.0 betas.\n\nHere’s a list of resources for the Python 3 Convert-a-thon at PSU MacAdmins 2019:\n\nPython 3 framework\n\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ (generic/stock framework from python.org)\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vjbb8zeqb7w1z2g/Python.framework.zip?dl=0 (relocatable framework with pip, PyObjC, xattr, and six pre-installed)\n\npython-modernize\n\nhttps://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\npylint\n\nhttps://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nInstall python-modernize and pylint using pip:\n\npip install modernize pip install pylint\n\n-or-\n\nApple Installer pkg containing python-modernize and pylint:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nxk5uq8b1vg2xij/psumacpytools-1.0.pkg?dl=0\n\nsix\n\nhttps://six.readthedocs.io\n\nsix is installed as part of Apple’s Python 2.7 install; if you download the relocatable Python 3 framework from the link above, it also includes (a newer version of) six.\n\nThe Conservative Python 3 Porting Guide\n\nhttps://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\nCheat Sheet: Writing Python 2-3 compatible code\n\nhttps://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html\n\nOne case-study\n\nhttps://medium.com/@boxed/moving-a-large-and-old-codebase-to-python3-33a5a13f8c99\n\nIf you are participating in my packaging workshop next week at Penn State, please prepare in advance by downloading these items.

These new applications are intended to behave nearly the same as the PyObjC-based applications they replace, with some speed and reliability improvements.\n\nMunki 3.6 will install (and is supported) on macOS 10.10+. Older macOS versions are no longer supported."
