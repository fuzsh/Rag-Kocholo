Updates that apply to specific Veracode regions show a region icon.\n\nFor updates specific to Veracode Fix, such as language and CWE support, see Fix updates.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements to the veracode package, veracode sbom and veracode scan commands:\n\nStreamlined the log output by removing overly detailed logs that were cluttering the console. This change improves readability and helps users focus on the most relevant information during the execution of commands. Detailed logs are still available using the --debug flag.\n\nWindows C/C++ packaging improvements, including parallel project builds, skipping non-C/C++ projects, and enhanced logging for failed builds.\n\nImproved error messaging.\n\nUpdated the Syft JSON schema from version 13.0.0 to 16.0.4.\n\nUpdated the CycloneDX XML schema from version 1.5 to 1.6.\n\nURL encoder is applied.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements:\n\nThe veracode static scan command has improved error messages that indicate whether API credentials are missing or invalid.\n\nThe veracode configure command now correctly uses directory paths that contain environment variables.\n\nGeneral performance improvements.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements to the veracode package command:\n\nSupport for C/C++ Windows, C/C++ Linux, COBOL, and Perl.\n\nSupport for multiple target frameworks defined in the *.csproj, Directory.Packages.props, and Directory.Build.props files in .NET projects.\n\nImproved language support for .NET.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements to the veracode package command:\n\nSupport for .NET Framework 4.6-4.8.\n\nSupport for restoring .NET projects with <TargetFramework>.\n\nImproved language support for Flutter, Android, PHP, and .NET.\n\nMore meaningful --debug messages if the command is not able to locate required build or packaging tools.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements\n\nThe veracode package and veracode scan commands are now supported on alpine-based environments.\n\nImproved Java, Javascript, and Python language support for the veracode package command.\n\nThe veracode static command now provides improved command output.\n\nThe veracode static command output now only displays scannable modules once.\n\nThis update adds the veracode dynamic command. You use this command to run a DAST Essentials dynamic analysis, check the status of the analysis, and output the results.\n\nThe veracode package command now supports Android, React Native, Dart, and Flutter.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements to the veracode package command:\n\nSupport for streaming log messages.\n\nImproved language support for .NET and Python.\n\nThis update includes the following improvements:\n\nThe veracode package command now supports iOS, in addition to existing support for Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python, PHP, Scala, Kotlin, Go, and Ruby on Rails. You use this command to auto-package your applications for Static Analysis and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) upload scans.\n\nThe packaged artifacts use a Veracode approved filename format.\n\nImproved error messaging.\n\nThe veracode package command output now displays the installed CLI version.\n\nThe veracode fix command now provides suggested fixes for a directory of source files, in addition to a single source file. You can fix flaws in multiple files as a batch, without having to rescan your code each time you apply a fix.\n\nThe veracode package command now supports application packaging for the following languages:\n\n.NET\n\nGo\n\nKotlin\n\nPHP\n\nRuby on Rails\n\nScala\n\nThe Veracode CLI now includes the following commands:\n\nveracode repository add: create an Excel file that lists all accessible repositories from which to import contributing developers.\n\nveracode repository report: create a report that lists all contributing developers for each repository.\n\nThe Veracode CLI now supports Static Analysis auto-packaging for Java, JavaScript, and Python.
