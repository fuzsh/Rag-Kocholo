        "text": "Python Macadmin Tools\n\nThis repository aims to collect a list of open-source Python-based tools for Mac systems administration tasks.\n\nWhy is this list limited to Python? Why not include all projects in this space? Python is an especially popular language among Mac sysadmins; this restriction is partly so that those learning Python for Mac-specific tasks have a mostly-complete list of known code and approaches from which to learn. It's also to help those more experienced with Python to discover projects that they may be able to adapt, extend and/or contribute to.\n\nSee something missing or incorrect? Please feel free to edit or clone this file and submit a pull request. This repo was inspired by R.I. Pienaar's popular free-for-dev repo.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMunki\n\nImagr\n\nServers\n\nDeployment automation, imaging, packaging\n\nClient-side management: utilities\n\nClient-side management: libraries and modules\n\nMobile Device Management (MDM)\n\nMisc. utilities and modules\n\nScripts and gists\n\nConfiguration management\n\nautopromoter - Automatically promote (or demote) Munki pkginfo catalogs.\n\nBananaEndocarp - BananaEndocarp is a scripted GUI for interacting with MunkiWebAdmin2's API, for creating per-machine manifests.\n\nBananaPeels - A framework for testing the deployement of packages via Munki wrapped in a CLI tool.
