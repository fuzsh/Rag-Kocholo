The worst offender is probably the requests module which get’s used often in custom processors:\n\nIf you would install the module simply via the ususal way e.g. pip3 install requests the problem would persist. The reason why is, that AutoPKG uses it’s own python binary and a custom location for libraries and modules.\n\nCustom AutoPKG python binary in the System Library folder⌗\n\nThe binary is located under /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3. So the path for modules and the python library is /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python3.7. Custom installed modules get installed under /Library/AutoPkg/Python3/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python3.7/site-packages/.\n\nSimply use the AutoPKG’s pip binary!⌗\n\nTo install modules in the right location you don’t need to move files or folders by hand (nor should you fiddle in these locations anyawy if you are not firm with python’s structure).\n\nYou can simply use the included pip binary to install modules. Remember to use sudo since you need root privileges to add files to the System Library:"
