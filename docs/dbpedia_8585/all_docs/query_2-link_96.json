I think almost everyone would agree that Jamf Pro (formerly Casper Suite) is the way to go if you can afford it, but of course that isn’t always an option.\n\nIn others threads it has been said that you can accomplish the same management as Jamf Pro with a combination of open source and competing tools so I wanted to see if we can set out to do just that. Obviously it won’t have the same easy management from a single control panel, but I’m sure for a lot of people having the functionality at all will make dealing with multiple admin screens worthwhile.\n\nI’ll keep the top post updated with any additional tools that are suggested. Maybe this will even be worthy of becoming a sticky post by the time we’re done so new readers can easily find it in the future.\n\nDefinition of free, cheap and/or open source:\n\nThings like Apple Remote Desktop and macOS Server would qualify since they are less than $100 for the pair. Meraki Systems Manager would also qualify for this discussion since it is free for up to 100 devices and would be useful in many smaller companies.\n\nSo what do y’all say, anyone interested in helping me come up with this blueprint? I’d love to hear your experiences with tools like these.\n\nI’ll add any additional tools y’all suggest and will organize these and make notes if we all come to any sort of consensus on specific products.\n\nOf course I didn’t come up with this list on my own.

And the output of -la shows as no different from -l\n\nFrom the manpage for softwareupdate:\n\n-d | --download Each update specified by args is downloaded but not installed. <b>The values of args are the same as for the --install command</b>.\n\nUpdates are downloaded and verified prior to install when using the -i (or --install) option, so there’s probably little need to specify downloading it first as that will happen anyway. If you wanted to postpone the install then you’d want to leave out the -i option but that’s not what you’ve shown.\n\n-l | --list List **all** available updates\n\nYou probably want -i -a (install all available updates) or -r (install recommended updates)\n\nAny who !\n\nAustin8413, Jumpcloud looks interesting, but shows as being free only for 10 users (but no info given about devices). Since you mentioned it here specifically in relation to MDM, could you please share some info about how many devices are permitted with the 10 free users ? Thanks ! (Given that the limit for the free Meraki MDM is 100 devices)."
