You can build a deb with\n\nfpm -s python -t deb $package-name-on-pypi\n\nor\n\nfpm -s python -t deb setup.py\n\nBuilding packages in other formats only requires you to change the -t (target type) parameter.\n\nTo produce debs I can also recommend python-stdeb.\n\nIt looks like you are looking for something like PyInstaller.\n\nIt can package the application for you in a very simple way.\n\nPlease have a look at the site.\n\nhttp://www.pyinstaller.org/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyinstaller/\n\nThe downside is it can only handle up to Python 2.7\n\nAutopackage : If you want to package for different linux distributions you can try autopackage http://code.google.com/p/autopackage/\n\nI do not have any experience with that so i do not know the details, and it seems to be unmaintained. I have looked through the code and it can be updated easily.\n\nBrief explanation : If you want to package for different distributions then there is no real tool that can do that flawless for you. Even PyInstaller has its issues. If you really want to support different distro's, the best way to go is to make packages for the distro you want and maintain/update these as your program grows."
