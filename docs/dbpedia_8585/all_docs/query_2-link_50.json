(and so it is a package manager or a distro-installer?), in such case, how much stable and userfriendly it works ?\n\n@Rebel450 basically the problem with Calamares is very simple:\n\nit is not the elive installer, and elive needs the elive installer\n\nto use it will require many many work\n\nand so many bugs to fix, and bugs that will appear to fix later\n\nbut again, since is not the elive installer it will not have the elive features that are needed\n\nthe elive installer is easy, anybody can install elive with it, and if is not, then it can (and should) be improved\n\ndon't think that I deny because no reasons\n\nnow, you are free to \"not believe me\" and trying it yourself, install calamares in Live mode in a virtual machine and try to use it for install elive, maybe you succeed! but for sure you will not install a same elive as we have (not finetune steps, not smart questions about specific things like a needed EFI partition if needed, not upgrade mode, not migration mode, not users updating, not packages-to-maintain-installed, not nvidia drivers included, not cleanups to make the system lighter, not many many many things), because there will be many things missing @Rebel450\n\nand just for mention these things to others to know: @triantares @yoda\n\nI think there is a point to be made though and that is:\n\nElive installation scripts gives a linear, ad hoc impression which \"calamares\" doesn't.\n\nI think we can contemplate beautifying the installer into an overall single application, giving a more \"in control\" feeling and oversight.\n\nUsing python (@Thanatermesis I know, I know!!) and webkit come to mind here...... hailing @stoppy98 there.\n\nWell, in fact is half linear half dynamic, and there comes the bigger problem about port it to other platform\n\nIn other words, the installer of elive is \"very smart\" changing the behaviour during the installation, for example:\n\nI just did an install before in a vbox, on which it was using reiserfs before (from 3.8.4 which is available), but since i installed the 32-bit version which includes and older kernel where the reiserfs support is buggy, the installer already knew that and told me that is going to proceed with a clean install instead, the migration mode \"code\" then changed to a new install\n\nThere's many smart things in the installer that cannot happen in other words, and which of course doesn't has interfaces for that, for example if you manually partition your system, other installers will simply proceed with the installation, but the elive installer checks if everything satisfy the correct installation, for example:\n\nif you are using an encrypted partition, it requires a /boot partition (so it warns you asking for it)\n\nif you are using a filesystem like reiser4 which grub cannot read, same thing\n\nif you booted the computer with UEFI and you don't have an EFI partition, it will require it\n\nif you are using a GPT disk and you don't have a BIOS partition, it will suggest (not required) to include it\n\nthere's too many things that cannot be done in a traditional single-interface installer (unless many many work involved on it, which of course, i don't have the resources to make it)\n\nYeah I agree. One thing that may also be annoying is the installation interrupting at times to ask you something. The best thing would be asking everything in the beginning, so the user just let the installation run, being free to mind his business and come back later with everything ready to reboot.\n\nI could try to help.\n\nBtw, we should move this topic\n\nOk about these, but for example prompting for \"ehy do you want this software\" at the end could be avoided i think. Same for \"ehy do you want to keep this stuff\", or even \"ehy why the hell are you using a vga, we're in 2020\" could be asked earlier (am i wrong?)\n\nagree, and in fact many things has been improved for that in the past actually maybe we can also include:\n\nasking for hostname\n\nasking for which partition to install grub (not sure if this one is possible because maybe depends of some installed files in the installed system)\n\nits just some extra things in the big TODO's\n\nwe can btw try to locate these exact messages and make a list, somewhere in Research , and so will be more easy to improve the installer based on the possible ones\n\nyep i think that there's a Calamares related thread around? not sure... in suggestions maybe is a good place\n\nAnother big BIG issue by using calamares (which i don't say that is bad software) or other installer, is that I constantly read reports from installations and fastly improve the installe with fixes or usability improvements, only a few ones (the most important to tell) are mentioned on the changelogs of the releases\n\nThis means basically:\n\ni know the code\n\ni know where to search\n\ni know where it can be the cause\n\ni know the language and im very fluent with it\n\nim entirely familiarized with the naming conventions and the style of the code\n\nin the case of using a different installer, how will be possible to maintain the application always updated with fixes and improvements and fastly included in the repo ? (oh btw, another unique feature: the elive installer automatically updates itself with minimal resources requirements (since doesn't uses apt) everytime an updated version is available on the repo)\n\nso in short, if we want a bugged, outdated and of course less featured installer, let's switch to calamares or any other\n\nremember that elive has made many of own apps when others doesnt' satisfy the needs, examples:\n\na wrapper for arandr to support \"remember\", startup loading, and primary screens\n\nan entire touchpad configurator (do we have any available? not at all), with some amazing features too\n\nmany other things that i dont remember\n\nmentions @Rebel450\n\nLOL\n\nAnd using calamares will put us in the pond of all those other Ubuntu derivates.........says a guy that even felt \"back home\" when confronted with the latest Slackware installer.\n\nAll laughs aside, I do think we could try and get all those \"zenity\" pop-ups (visually) under control.\n\nIt's all a matter of perception ....UX.\n\nhey, its not all about a simple (single) message popup in zenity there's more than that!\n\nsee this example from the old installers VS updated versions, more exactly about the \"create a new user\" step, it was before like that:\n\nPOPUP insert an username\n\nverify that the chars are correct, or repeat\n\nPOPUP insert a password\n\nverify correct characters\n\nPOPUP repeat\n\nverify they are the same\n\nPOPUP autologin ?\n\nPOPUP admin privileges?\n\nwhich have been moved to a single one, not using zenity but \"yad\" instead:\n\nPOPUP set all the users data (including more features which we didn't had before) - that's all, all in a single one\n\nsame example with the first \"welcome\" window which checkboxes of advanced-settings and guided install etc...\n\nGood point. I was super annoyed when I couldn't do something because elive was installing and I had to be there to answer its questions before the battery of the laptop died (I didn't have the charger then.)\n\nProblem: @Thanatermesis doesn't know Python IIRC so he can't maintain it.\n\nGitea's another option, it looks a heck ton like github\n\nActually there's a publicly hosted server (in case you dont want to rent a very cheap (gitea's very light) server) for gitea and it's free at gitea.com.\n\nCouldn't there be a way to ask these questions at the start of install, put in a temporary file, and pipe it into user-manager? Or is it not designed for a headless mode? (Might be smart to add it, it'd be useful for IT people bulk-creating users)\n\nHere's a link to the english one\n\nOr EFLs...considering we're using enlightenment it'd just make everything look in sync...\n\nI rest my case. Tho we couldn't put the password in a temporary file, that would be insecure.\n\nI find myself wondering how other distros do it."
