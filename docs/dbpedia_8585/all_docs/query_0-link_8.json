The PkgSigner processor used in this workflow was originally written by Paul Suh and it uses Apple’s productsign tool to access a Developer ID Installer certificate stored in the login keychain.\n\nLike other processors and AutoPkg itself, PkgSigner needed updating to Python 3 when Python 2 reached end-of-life in April 2020.
