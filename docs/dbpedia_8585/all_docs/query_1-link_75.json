        "text": "Package name, or package specifier with version.\n\nSyntax varies with package manager. For example name-1.0 or name=1.0.\n\nPackage names also vary with package manager; this module will not “translate” them per distribution. For example libyaml-dev, libyaml-devel.\n\nTo operate on several packages this can accept a comma separated string of packages or a list of packages, depending on the underlying package manager.\n\nThe required package manager module to use (dnf, apt, and so on). The default auto will use existing facts or try to auto-detect it.\n\nYou should only use this field if the automatic selection is not working for some reason.\n\nSince version 2.17 you can use the ansible_package_use variable to override the automatic detection, but this option still takes precedence.\n\nDefault: \"auto\"\n\nForces a ‘global’ task that does not execute per host, this bypasses per host templating and serial, throttle and other loop considerations\n\nConditionals will work as if run_once is being used, variables used will be from the first available host\n\nThis action will not work normally outside of lockstep strategies"
