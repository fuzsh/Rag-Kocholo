There’s also a huge CPU utilisation. Running the file from the shell works fine.\n\nAs with the old problem, the strange thing is that the repl is a pure Python repl, so no installation of packages is needed. And I don’t even know what gardenlinux does.\n\nUnfortunately, the old solution doesn’t work.\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nHitting Run just runs the selected file (current.py). No installation of the gardenlinux package.\n\nActual behavior:\n\nSee above.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nI don’t know how to replicate except trying to run the repl in question.\n\nBug appears at this link:\n\nhttps://replit.com/@TimsbimPython/Morsels\n\nBrowser: Safari\n\nOS: MacOS\n\nDevice (Android, iOS, n/a leave blank): MacBook Pro\n\nPlan (Free, Hacker, Pro Plan): Teams Pro\n\nHey all!\n\nI was able to reproduce the issue and let the team know. I believe this is to do with our new Modules system that encapsulates configuration for languages such as Python onto our own infrastructure. This seems to prevent users from configuring the packager in the .replit file.\n\nI will follow up once I have an update."
