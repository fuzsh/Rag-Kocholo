        "text": "Why choose LoadUp?\n\nSustainable disposal through donation and recycling ‚ôªÔ∏è\n\nDon‚Äôt let your old mattress add to landfill waste. As part of our mission to be an eco-friendly company, our team tries to find a new home for your mattress through donation to a Berkshire area charity. Help make a difference and book a pickup for mattress donation.\n\nüìç Berkshire service areas\n\nConvenient mattress disposal in your area\n\nWe are proud to offer our mattress disposal services throughout Berkshire County and provide an easy solution to getting rid of your old mattress. Our hassle-free approach to junk disposal is why we‚Äôre highly recommended in areas like West Stockbridge, Pittsfield, and Washington.\n\nCovering Berkshire & surrounding areas!\n\nResponsibly getting rid of an old mattress is simpler than you think. If yours is in decent shape, donating it is a good option. If it‚Äôs seen better days, recycling might be the answer. And if you‚Äôre dreading the thought of moving it, we‚Äôve got you covered. LoadUp will pick up your mattress and take it to the right place for a small fee. Whether it ends up being donated or recycled depends on its condition, and we can‚Äôt guarantee donation acceptance.\n\nTo book mattress pickup, simply use our online platform. Just tell us what we are picking up, where you‚Äôre located, and choose how you‚Äôd like us to pick it up ‚Äì inside your home or right from the curb. We make it clear what the price will be before you finalize your appointment, making everything straightforward and stress-free.\n\nMany local charities and donation centers in Berkshire will take your mattress as a donation as long as it is in good condition and unsoiled. It is a good idea to call ahead of time before you haul your mattress there, just to make sure they will accept it. If you don‚Äôt have the means to transport your mattress to a charity or donation center, book a pickup with LoadUp. Our team will show up to your house, pick up your old mattress, and drop it off at a donation center in the area, as long as it‚Äôs in good condition.\n\nAbsolutely, we can take your bed frame and anything else you need hauled away. Our service isn‚Äôt limited to just mattresses. Box springs, bed frames, you name it. When booking, tell us what to pick up. Our goal is to provide you with a hassle-free way to clear out unwanted items.\n\nPricing for pick up and disposal of your mattress starts at $89. The total cost will depend upon what exactly you need picked up. For example, pickup of just your mattress will be cheaper than pickup and removal of your mattress, box spring, and bed frame. When you book our services online, tell us exactly what we are picking up and you will get upfront pricing before you confirm your appointment. We work hard to keep our prices low and get you cost-effective disposal services."
