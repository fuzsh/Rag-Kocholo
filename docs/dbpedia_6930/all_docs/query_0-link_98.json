        "text": "Background\n\nOn 27 February the UK and EU agreed the Windsor Framework, providing a fundamentally new set of arrangements to restore the smooth flow of trade within the UK internal market; safeguard Northern Ireland’s place in the Union; and address the democratic deficit that was otherwise at the heart of the original Northern Ireland Protocol. These arrangements were adopted at the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee on 24 March.\n\nFurther detail on the arrangements overall are set out in the Command Paper, the Windsor Framework: a new way forward.\n\nContext\n\nThis page sets out further detail on how the Windsor Framework will work in practice as part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to working with, and supporting businesses as the new arrangements are implemented. These pages will be updated with further guidance as it is made available. This guidance sets out further operational information on the relevant legal obligations that apply, which are set out in the legal texts underpinning the Framework (these are set out on a dedicated page.)\n\nThe implementation of the Framework will happen in stages through into 2025, to provide businesses with time to adapt to new arrangements.\n\nSome arrangements are already in force. On 1 May 2023 a temporary VAT zero-rate was introduced in Northern Ireland for the domestic installation of solar panels, insulation, heat pumps and other energy saving materials (further details can be found here). This relief has been available in the rest of the UK since 2022 but was previously blocked in Northern Ireland by the Protocol. A permanent scheme has also been introduced to support the movement and sale of second-hand cars into Northern Ireland from Great Britain (further details can be found here). And on 30 June, the Government launched a new reimbursement scheme for EU duty paid on “at risk” goods which have been sold or used outside of the EU.\n\nOther elements will come into force from later this year and beyond, in accordance with the arrangements and conditions that the Framework sets out.\n\nFrom 30 September 2023, a new UK Internal Market Scheme will expand the range of businesses able to benefit from the new arrangements provided to protect internal UK movements, including the removal of EU tariffs. In tandem, the new sanitary and phytosanitary “green lane” arrangements will take effect: including a new Retail Movement Scheme for agrifood retail products; new rules to allow plants to move smoothly in to Northern Ireland; and new arrangements to enable seed potatoes to move once again from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nFrom September 2024, the full “green lane” will take effect for the movement of all goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, expanding the benefits of the UK Internal Market Scheme to end unnecessary bureaucracy. This will ensure that goods will no longer move on the basis of international customs requirements, with a new system based on commercial information. New arrangements will also come into effect for the movement of parcels between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with a new set of data-sharing requirements put in place to ensure that customs declarations are not needed for deliveries to consumers.\n\nIn 2025, new arrangements for the supply of medicines into Northern Ireland will take effect, ensuring that medicines available in Northern Ireland are those approved by UK authorities, enabling a single licence and a single pack for medicines right across the United Kingdom.\n\nIn all cases, all existing grace periods and practical arrangements will continue up until the point of new arrangements coming into force, in order to provide certainty and a smooth transition for businesses.\n\nFurther details on these new arrangements are set out on separate guidance pages which are linked below. This guidance will continue to be updated on an ongoing basis, alongside ongoing engagement with industry and other stakeholders."
