        "text": "Yes, but home shredders can be slow, messy and jam easily. Why waste your own or staff time on document shredding when you can use our secure document shredding service?\n\nAlso, strip-cut shredders produce strips of paper which can be pieced together again if someone wanted to read your confidential material.\n\nWhether you are a busy household or a small or medium sized business, we’re the local shredding company to take that headache away.\n\nOur industrial shredders can also destroy materials that home shredders can’t. For example, hard drives, mobile phones, USB sticks, CDs/DVDs, SIM cards, credit/debit cards etc\n\nAlthough it would be easy to buy a cheap home shredder, several things should be taken into account. Most home and office shredding machines shred documents in a way that they can be put back together again. There is also the time it takes prepare (removing staples, paper clips etc) and shred documents one or two pages at a time.\n\nVery. All staff are DBS checked, we do not employ agency staff or casual labour. Our sealed sacks are bar coded and transported in our tracked vehicles to be shredded under CCTV at our facility. As the sacks are made of tough paper, they do not need to be opened before going into the shredder. A Certificate of Destruction identifying the bar coded sacks is emailed automatically after shredding"
