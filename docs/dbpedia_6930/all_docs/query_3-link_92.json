        "text": "We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the traditional custodians of our land – Australia. The Gadigal of the Eora Nation are the traditional custodians of our local area.\n\nAs a mark of respect to the traditional custodians, our events, official meetings, functions and other special occasions begin with a Welcome to Country or an acknowledgement of Country.\n\nWe encourages other organisations, community groups and event producers to include a Welcome to Country or an Acknowledgement of Country on appropriate occasions.\n\nWelcome to Country\n\nA Welcome to Country or Traditional Welcome is where the traditional Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander custodians welcome people to their land at the beginning of a meeting, event or ceremony. This welcome must be conducted by an appropriate person such as a recognised Elder from the local area.\n\nWelcome to Country enables the Traditional Custodians to give their blessing to the event and is an important mark of respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as Australia’s original inhabitants.\n\nWhether spoken or performed, the aim of the ceremony is to acknowledge the traditional custodians and welcome the wider community.\n\nThe Elder or a representative will give their blessing to the event, function, meeting or occasion. In response, the host or key speaker will acknowledge the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities by paying respects to Elders past and present.\n\nAcknowledgement of Country\n\nAcknowledgement of Country is where other people acknowledge and show respect for the traditional custodians of the land on which the event is taking place.\n\nSuch an Acknowledgement of Country can be used exclusively if an Elder or other appropriate member of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander communities is not available to perform a Welcome to Country.\n\nIn our area when opening an event, or at the start of a speech, a statement like this can be used:\n\nTraditional custodians\n\nTraditional owners and custodians are the terms used to describe the original Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples who inhabited an area.\n\nTraditional custodians today are descendants of these original inhabitants and have continuing spiritual, cultural, political and often physical connection with particular land where their ancestors lived.\n\nThe traditional owners and custodians of the local area are known as the Gadigal people.\n\nFor more information regarding traditional owners and custodians please contact the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council.\n\nContacts\n\nFor information about how to appropriately conduct a Welcome to Country, contact the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council.\n\nIf you would like to be provided with contact details for an appropriate representative to conduct a traditional welcome, be sure to get in touch 2 weeks minimum before your event."
