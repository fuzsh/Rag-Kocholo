These distinct regions allow our department to plan, develop, and provide mental health services that are better suited to meet the specific needs of the residents in these different areas.\n\nThe eight Service Areas are as follows:\n\nService Area 1 (Antelope Valley)\n\nService Area 2 (San Fernando & Santa Clarita Valleys)\n\nService Area 3 (San Gabriel Valley)\n\nService Area 4 (Metro LA)\n\nService Area 5 (West LA)\n\nService Area 6 (South LA)\n\nService Area 7 (East LA)\n\nService Area 8 (South Bay)\n\n(Note: You may enter your street address in this District Locator to find out which service area you are a part of.)\n\nWe invite you to explore the services/resources in your Service Area*, and get involved with our program planning & implementation process through our Service Area Leadership Teams (SALTs)."
