We do not offer diagnostic assessments but require the GP to have made the ME/CFS diagnosis.\n\nWe are a team of physiotherapists and psychologists who work largely within a Acceptance and Commitment Therapeutic approach. We offer individual interventions as well as a Stabilisation group programme.\n\nWe are able to offer video, telephone or face to face appointments."
