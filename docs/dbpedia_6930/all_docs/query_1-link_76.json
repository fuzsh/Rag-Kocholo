        "text": "Palliative care is end of life care for someone with a life limiting illness. First of all, it involves managing any physical symptoms, such as pain. Palliative care also involves emotional and psychological support for the person dying and their loved ones.\n\nAcross Berkshire, palliative care can be provided in various settings depending on personal circumstances and preference. This includes the hospital, home, hospice or care home.\n\nThis guide will look at the options available along with contact details.\n\nThe Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust palliative care team bring comfort and dignity to patients and their families across the county. The team can provide palliative care in hospital or in a patient’s own home.\n\nThe Highclere and Donnington wards at West Berkshire Community Hospital are equipped to accommodate all palliative care needs and the doctors and nurses on the ward specialise in end of life medicine and care. The community nursing team provide palliative care in the home.\n\nTo access the NHS palliative care service in Berkshire, please speak to your GP or healthcare professional.\n\nFor more information regarding hospitals in the county please see our guide to NHS and care services in Berkshire.\n\nAn advance directive, sometimes known as an advance statement, is a declaration that outlines an individual’s future care plan, taking into account all of their personal preferences. It means that if someone becomes so unwell that they can no longer communicate, their relatives are clear on how to make the best decisions on their behalf.\n\nIt is important to note that an advance directive is not the same as an advance decision, also known as a living will. This is a decision made in advance to refuse certain treatments in the future.\n\nFor more information on advance directives and how to make one, please see our comprehensive Age Space guide to Advance Directives and Living Wills.\n\nThe Thames Hospice provides expert care for people with a life-limiting illness in East Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire. They also work to support families and carers. Thames Hospice attend to physical, social and psychological needs among patients. They have a highly skilled medical team to arrange a programme of tailored care to individual needs. Support can be provided in a number of settings, depending on circumstances as outlined below.\n\nThe Living Well Service helps patients to manage and adapt to the challenges of living with a life-limiting condition. The Thames Hospice offer a range of activities and therapies to help build confidence, promote independence and wellbeing and ensure that patients maintain a good quality of life.\n\nPatients will receive an initial assessment at the Hospice in Maidenhead with one of their Clinical Specialists and will then be able to access a range of services tailored to their needs, such as complementary therapy, physiotherapy, counselling support and day therapy services. You will also be able to join a supportive six week wellbeing programme at the Hospice, offering advice and information on managing symptoms, nutrition and diet, as well as practical advice on managing financial matters.\n\nReferrals can be made by a patient’s GP or any healthcare professional involved a patient’s care.\n\nCounselling and lymphoedema referrals can be made by individuals or family members.\n\nThe team are happy to show potential patients and families around the hospice’s facilities. Please get in touch using the contact details below."
