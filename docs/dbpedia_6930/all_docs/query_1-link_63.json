Helping to enrich the lives of the children and their families is at the heart of our service, our end of life and bereavement support is just a part of what we do.\n\nOur children’s hospice service covers the whole of Berkshire and into surrounding counties. If you think your child may be eligible for our services, please do get in touch."
