I work for a family of 4, their little dog, and their guests for 15 hours a week. I change the bed linen and towels, do all the laundry and ironing, water the plants, clean and disinfect the kitchen and bathrooms, hoover, dust, mop the floors, empty all the bins, load and empty the dishwasher put away food shopping deliveries, clean the fireplace and lay fresh wooden logs. I also clean an Airbnb, one-bed apartment in Eton. I am hoping to build my hours with the Turno app, as I work well independently and am self-motivated. I also drive and am very reliable. I like using eco-friendly cleaning products and enjoy arranging flowers. I can only travel up to 10 miles due to my current work commitments in Maidenhead.
