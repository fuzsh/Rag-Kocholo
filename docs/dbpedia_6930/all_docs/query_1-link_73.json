We offer donors, nonprofits and community groups the tools and expertise to achieve their philanthropic vision and goals, and identify critical areas where the foundation can leverage its relationships and leadership for lasting impact. Founded in 1987 in Salisbury, Conn., Berkshire Taconic serves Berkshire County, Mass.; Columbia and northeast Dutchess County, N.Y.; and northwest Litchfield County, Conn. In all, we serve the residents of 70 towns and three cities across three states, within a 2,200-square mile region.\n\nLike most community foundations, BTCF offers a variety of fund types that allow donors and community groups to build charitable resources and make grants and other awards over time to achieve their philanthropic goals. BTCF has also proactively established funds to address a specific issue in our region or to develop permanent charitable resources to serve a set of communities. This has resulted in the creation and growth of 11 area funds, 33 educational enrichment funds that serve every public school district in our region, and special initiatives to address regional challenges, such as the shortage of high-quality early childhood programs and affordable housing options.\n\nIn total, the foundation manages more than 550 funds totaling nearly $200 million in combined assets that together make over $10 million in grants and other awards each year.
