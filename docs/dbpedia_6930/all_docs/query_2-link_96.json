Each character in the VIN number has a significant meaning. Together, they create a number that provides information about the vehicle and its unique history.\n\nWhere is the VIN located?\n\nThe VIN can be found on the VIN plate located on the driver's side of the dashboard just below the windshield (1). The VIN can also be found on the driver-side doorframe label (2), as well as on documents related to the vehicle's registration, title and insurance."
