        "text": "After many years of use, the potable waterline and related infrastructure at Chain Lakes and Beauvais Lake Provincial Parks require assessment and design services to identify options for refurbishment, replacement and/or reconfiguration in order to address the changing needs of the public and to continue to provide an enjoyable and safe camping experience. This project will review the existing waterlines, and provide recommendations for modernization of the system. Including the installation of new waterlines where needed, new infrastructure (faucets, fire-hydrants, vaults, cisterns, valves, etc.), and new service connections to buildings/park facilities throughout both Provincial Parks. Alberta Parks owns and operates the water treatment plants (WTP) at both Provincial Parks and both WTP’s were recently upgraded so minimal work is anticipated within the buildings but assessments and licenses to operate will need to be completed and reviewed.\n\nThe purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is for interested professional engineering firms to prepare and submit a formal response to the request per the requirements outlined within.\n\nAssuming availability of appropriate funding, the successful Proponent will be responsible for working towards and advancing the projects listed below. The following is an overview of the projects included in the RFP and their respective goals and objectives:\n\ni. Chain Lakes Provincial Park – Potable Water Main Line Replacement\n\nThe overall intent of this project is to modernize the existing potable waterline and related infrastructure throughout the Provincial Park where applicable and ensure minimal environmental disturbance. This also includes service connections to each day-use & group-use, campground, staff housing, shop, dump station, concession, and MD of Ranchland office. In 2008 – 550 metres of 50mm DR11 waterline was installed from the WTP the Staff house #1 – refer to Appendix A – Chain Lakes PP.\n\nii. Beauvais Lake Provincial Park – Potable Water Main Line Replacement\n\nThe overall intent of this project is to modernize the existing potable waterline and related infrastructure throughout the Provincial Park where applicable and ensure minimal environmental disturbance. This also includes service connections to each day-use & group-use, campground/walk-in tenting, staff housing, shop, dump station, and the Parks office. The main distribution valves are located in the Valve House which requires heating throughout the winter months, the intent would be to bury those valves and remove the building – refer to Appendix A – Beauvais Lake PP. The water tower is also old and the goal would be to replace it with a buried tank. In 2013 the waterline in the\n\ncampground and related infrastructure was replaced (50mm DR11 pipe) – refer to Appendices A – Beauvais Lake PP – 2013 Work."
