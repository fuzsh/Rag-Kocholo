        "text": "Texas Monthly, owned by Texas Monthly LLC, and the City of Grand Prairie have formed a multiyear partnership to curate special events that celebrate Texans and Texas culture. Those events will include the official Texas Country Reporter Festival, a much-anticipated Texas Monthly taco festival, and a new event for barbecue lovers. The collaboration not only brings Texas Monthly’s premier events to North Texas, but it also highlights Grand Prairie as a top destination in the state.\n\nThe official TCR Festival, previously held in Waxahachie, will relocate to downtown Grand Prairie in the spring of 2025 with an array of vendors, food, music, and headliner entertainment.\n\n“We are excited to join forces with such a great organization and designate Grand Prairie as the new home for one of the state’s most anticipated events,” said Grand Prairie mayor Ron Jensen. “Visitors from all over will soon experience firsthand why Grand Prairie is touted as the ultimate staycation destination.”\n\nIn addition to the TCR Festival, Texas Monthly will launch a new barbecue-centered event, as well as introduce a taco festival based on the magazine’s upcoming “best taquerias and tacos” list by taco editor José R. Ralat, to Grand Prairie’s Epic Central. The 172-acre entertainment district—one of the state’s newest—includes an indoor water park, a Vegas-style water and light show, waterfront dining options, live music, playgrounds, hotels and a convention center, and an indoor family adventure park.\n\nEpic Central is also home to the city’s Epic Arts and Music Festival, for which Texas Monthly will serve as a media sponsor this year. The festival will be held on October 19 and 20. There, fans of the Texas Country Reporter series will get a chance to meet the show’s new host, J.B. Sauceda, as well as some of TCR’s favorite vendors. The fifty-third season of Texas Country Reporter begins airing in September.\n\nThese events are just a few of the many festivities Texas Monthly and the City of Grand Prairie plan to collaborate on moving forward.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Grand Prairie for years to come on events that bring Texas Monthly and Texas Country Reporter to life in a setting that is truly spectacular,” said Scott Brown, the multimedia company’s president."
