The parking program includes a mix of free, paid, and offshore parking spaces.\n\nRECONCILIATION: Historically, there have been about 140 parking spaces assigned to offshore residents. Of those spaces, around 40 are assigned to the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation (as of 2023). This designation comes after extensive conversations between the District of Tofino and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation on matters regarding reconciliation. The designation of these parking spaces recognizes Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation’s traditional territory.\n\nWORKING TOGETHER: The District of Tofino regularly meets with the leadership of both Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation and Ahousaht First Nation to discuss parking challenges. Finding a lasting solution will likely require involvement from higher levels of government, beyond our local government. As communities continue to grow, parking challenges will only worsen without new land development.\n\nTAKING ACTION\n\nThe District of Tofino is currently working towards the following in regards to offshore parking:\n\nA covered shelter will be installed at First Street Dock with seating and temporary storage. Estimated Completion: Late 2024/Early 2025\n\nDesignated parking for Tla-o-qui-aht, Ahousaht, and Hesquiaht elders with valid Offshore Parking permits will be offered on First Street, between Main Street and the First Street Dock. A new stairway will soon provide improved access to the dock. Estimated Completion: Late 2024/Early 2025\n\nA transit stop has been installed at First Street & Main Street to allow for closer bus access to offshore parking: Completed Summer 2024\n\n12 additional Offshore Parking spaces located on Gibson Street were added. Completed Spring 2024\n\nDistrict staff will continue to work with partners from all levels of government to bring parking solutions to the downtown core. Ongoing\n\nOffshore Parking Contacts\n\nTla-o-qui-aht First Nation: 250-725-3350\n\nAhousaht First Nation: ​250-670-9563\n\nHesquiaht First Nation: 250-670-1122\n\nPay Parking FAQs\n\nIn the past, parking congestion at Tofino's beaches and downtown core has negatively impacted the experience of both visitors and residents. Informal and poor parking habits frequently resulted in degraded road safety, infrastructure damage, high enforcement needs and reduced parking convenience and access.\n\nIn 2021, the District of Tofino committed to improving public parking layout and design to address this issue. Beach and Downtown pay parking was introduced to cover the costs related to parking, including the dedicated enforcement resources. Up until now, parking-related costs have been funded by taxation.\n\nPay Parking is a proven method to increase parking availability in publicly used spaces, which provides more opportunities for shared access to public assets. Parking revenues also offer a new and important funding source for programs, services, and facilities benefiting the community.\n\nNo. Municipalities are prohibited from assisting businesses under section 25 of the Community Charter. Providing a free parking pass for a business-owned vehicle would violate this rule. However, business owners can pay for hourly, day, and annual passes, and parking receipts can be recorded as business expenses.\n\nParking passes can be purchased at the pay stations or via the online parking apps highlighted on the pay parking signage throughout the community.\n\nAnnual commercial passes can be purchased in person at the Municipal Hall at 121 Third Street.\n\nRevenues from parking throughout Tofino (including beach and downtown pay parking) go towards the District's Pay Parking Reserve Fund, which helps to fund various initiatives throughout the District, including:\n\nRecreation Facilities & Equipment\n\nRoads, Sidewalks and MUP Infrastructure\n\nParks Facilities\n\nTransit\n\nCustomers can pay and manage their parking needs via the parking meter (credit card or coin payment), via digital apps such as Honk Mobile App, Pay By Phone App and also payment through a 1-800 number listed on the parking signage.\n\nCampbell Street is a provincial highway under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI), and it is not included in Downtown Pay Parking.\n\nCampbell Street does have free time-limited parking available.\n\nAll available parking spaces are on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nOvernight street parking is not permitted except for downtown residents with a permit and displayed vehicle decal.\n\nOvernight camping in any vehicle throughout the District of Tofino is not permitted at any time.\n\nThe Municipal Hall lots are designed for long-term parking.\n\nResidents with a free Downtown Pay Parking permit who can not park at their place of business are encouraged to park on Gibson Street and side streets. The goal is to free up parking availability nearest Campbell Street so that residents and visitors can have easier access to local businesses.\n\nA Downtown Pay Parking permit cannot be used to park at the Municipal Hall lots. Separate payment is required if parking at these lots.\n\nIt is recommended that those who work in the downtown area consider alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, or taking public transit.\n\nNo, the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve has its own pay parking system.\n\nYes, the decals that downtown residents receive, allowing them to park on their street, are renewed annually and must be collected from the Municipal Hall prior to May 1 each year."
