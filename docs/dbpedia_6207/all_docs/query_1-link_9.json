Many of the sites are not even close to level, and we paid $38 for no services. It was $46 for power. Apparently it closes Sept 18 for the season as well.\n\nReport Check-In\n\nA fine provincial park - had a good enough cell signal for some work and work calls, access to fresh water, laundry facilities ($2.50 wash, $1.25 dry) and showers.\n\nReport Check-In\n\nstayed one night. self check in after dark, 38.7 a night with a tent and car. pretty pricey, would not stay again unless I specifically wanted the provincial park amenities.\n\nReport Check-In\n\nThe campground is in the Provincial Park Aaron.
