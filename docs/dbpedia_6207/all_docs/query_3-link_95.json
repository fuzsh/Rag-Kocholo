But Ontario isn’t just green in cottage country – we have urban parks, beautiful gardens, conservation areas, and nature centres scattered around our cities and lush plant life all over. How about soaking up the sun and sand? While Ontario isn’t known as a place for a beach holiday, we have dozens of gorgeous ones, many of which have achieved Blue Flag status.\n\nNarrow your selection by choosing a region from the pulldown list above"
