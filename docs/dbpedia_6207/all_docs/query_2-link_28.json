        "text": "authority\n\nPercival Baxter submitted legislation in 1939 that established the Baxter State Park Authority as the sole governing body of the Park consisting of the Director of the Maine Forest Service, the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Maine Attorney General.\n\nMembers of the Baxter State Park Authority:\n\nAaron M. Frey – Maine Attorney General\n\nIn January of 2019, the House and Senate jointly elected Rep. Aaron Frey, D-Bangor, to succeed Governor-elect Janet Mills as attorney general. Frey, born and raised in Bangor, graduated from Saint Anselm with a Bachelor’s degree in politics and later received a Juris Doctor degree from Roger Williams University school of law. Prior to being elected to serve as Maine’s 58th Attorney General, Mr. Frey worked in private legal practice in Bangor, focusing on matters involving criminal defense and family law. He represented part of Bangor and part of Orono for three terms in the Maine House of Representatives, from 2012 to 2018. In the Legislature, he was a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee. Mr. Frey presently resides in Bangor.\n\nThe Attorney General is Maine’s chief law enforcement officer and represents the state in legal matters ranging from child support enforcement, civil rights and consumer protection to the prosecution of homicides, felony drug cases, and major frauds. “I am honored and excited to lead a department with such a talented professional staff who work tirelessly on behalf of the people of Maine,” said Frey. “I look forward to working productively with Maine’s Legislature and the executive branch in what I hope will be a new era of cooperation and civility in state government, leading to positive results for our state.”\n\nJudy Camuso – Commissioner, Inland Fisheries and Wildlife\n\nDepartment of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Commissioner Judy Camuso, appointed to the position by Governor Janet T. Mills, was Director of the Wildlife Division since 2013 and has 10 years experience with MDIFW. Judy lives in Freeport, Maine, and is responsible for the division’s $12 million annual budget, directing a staff of 45 wildlife professionals, including field staff, species specialists, and group and section leaders.\n\nCamuso previously served as an assistant regional wildlife biologist and as a special projects coordinator. Before joining IFW, Camuso worked as director of Gilsland Farm Audubon Center in Falmouth, where she was responsible for the management of Maine Audubon’s headquarters facility, oversaw operations of the nature center and sanctuary property, and coordinated educational programming for families, adults, and children.\n\nIn 2015, she received the department’s Employee of the Year, Governor’s Award. She also is a licensed bird bander and an avid birder, as well as a hunter who likes to hike, canoe, and bike. She is a graduate of the University of Vermont and holds a bachelor of science degree in wildlife biology.\n\nPatty Cormier – Director, Maine Forest Service\n\nAs Director of the Maine Forest Service, Patty Cormier also represents the final triad of the completely new BSP Authority in 2019. In her position as director, Cormier will interface with federal and state agencies, representing the forestry interests of Maine, and will oversee three divisions – Forest Protection, Forest Policy and Management, and Forest Health and Monitoring. Bringing over 30 years of forestry experience to her position, Director Cormier is well poised for the opportunities and challenges this new position brings. As for her additional role as Baxter’s new Authority member, Cormier stated, “ I am completely humbled to be part of one of Maine’s earliest efforts for land conservation. To be part of the Baxter Park Authority is not something to be taken lightly, and I appreciate the trust put in myself and the other members to uphold the values Percival P. Baxter worked so hard for, for the people of Maine.”\n\nClick here for information about BSP’s four all-volunteer Advisory Committees\n\nBSP Staff 2024"
