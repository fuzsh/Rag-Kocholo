        "text": "Welcome to Bear Lake State Park!\n\nNOTICE: Bear Lake State Park is currently under Stage 1 Fire Restrictions. No open fires are allowed except within established campfire facilities in our improved campgrounds and picnic areas. Visit Utah Fire Info’s website for more information on these restrictions. #FireSense makes sense\n\nBrilliantly blue waters combined with sandy beaches are what call park visitors to play, fish, boat, and camp here at Bear Lake State Park. Minerals (calcium carbonate) suspended in the lake’s waters are what help create its spectacular aqua-blue color.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Bear Lake Valley in Rich County, there are three distinct recreation areas: Marina, Rendezvous Beach, and the Eastside, which offer a variety of recreational opportunities. Whether you plan on spending a day, weekend, or more, Bear Lake offers some of the best picnicking, camping, boating, fishing, or hiking that you will find in the great state of Utah. For more information on the three areas of Bear Lake, please check out our Facilities page.\n\nSo come to take a break with us and enjoy some time in the great outdoors that is the beautiful natural resource known as Bear Lake State Park.\n\nLearn More"
