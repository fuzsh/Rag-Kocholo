        "text": "EDMONTON — The main east-west highway through Jasper National Park is expected to reopen to all traffic Friday -- the first time since a wildfire forced 25,000 people to flee more than two weeks ago.\n\nBut when the road opens, there’s no stopping, not even for bathroom breaks.\n\nJoe Zatylny, with Alberta's emergency management agency, said drivers cannot stop or exit Highway 16 given there are still active wildfires in the park.\n\n\"Everyone should make sure they have a full tank of gas before entering the park,” Zatylny told reporters Thursday.\n\n“There will be no washroom breaks or refuelling.”\n\nDrivers were encouraged to drive cautiously through the park, and follow speed limits and road signs.\n\nThe road, which opened last week to large commercial trucks, will stay open as long as it’s safe to do so given the fire in the park, which remains out of control.\n\nThe highway will open for 14 hours, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., unless fires threaten.\n\nThe Icefields Parkway, the north-south route linking Jasper and Banff national parks, remains closed except to those battling the fires.\n\nHowever, certain sections of that highway were expected to reopen to general traffic starting Friday.\n\nThe Jasper fire forced 20,000 park visitors and 5,000 town residents to leave just over a day before a fire destroyed a third of all town structures on July 24.\n\nEvacuees had to initially flee west to B.C. as the fire cut road access to the east and south.\n\nHomes and businesses were destroyed but key infrastructure, such as schools and the water treatment plant, were saved. A timeline for town residents to return has not been set.\n\nThe fire, which measured 340 square kilometres in size Thursday, destroyed 358 structures in the town.\n\nFlames damaged several bridges in the area, including the Moberly Bridge and the Old Fort Point Bridge.\n\nZatylny said the bridges mainly sustained cosmetic damage, adding that officials deemed the infrastructure safe.\n\n\"But of course, they're monitoring for any conditions to change,\" he said.\n\nIn the Jasper townsite, crews continued to clear away debris and reconnect gas, water and power.\n\nThey were also knocking over pieces of homes and buildings but only as a last resort if something like a chimney, tree or partial wall was proving a hazard and would prevent a homeowner or insurance adjuster from safely walking on the property.\n\n“Crews are not sifting through or removing any debris on private property,” said a statement from federal officials.\n\nAlberta Wildfire spokeswoman Christie Tucker said 115 wildfires were burning across the province, including 13 listed as out of control.\n\nTwo wildfires near Rocky Mountain House in central Alberta were being held, she said.\n\nTucker also said southern parts of the province have seen rain, reducing fire behaviour. With warmer temperatures expected in the north, resources from the south were being repositioned, she said.\n\nShe said 119 Canadian soldiers working on the Jasper fire were being redeployed north to High Level to help fight fires there.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 8, 2024.\n\nAaron Sousa, The Canadian Press"
