        "text": "Over the past several years, camping at Ontario Parks has grown steadily from 4.3 million reserved campsite nights in 2014 to over 6.6 million reserved campsite nights in 2021.\n\nWith reservations on the rise, Ontario Parks staff want to ensure that more Ontarians can enjoy campground campsites at some of the more popular parks during their busy summer season.\n\nTo help connect more campers with campground sites at their favourite parks, Ontario Parks is reducing the maximum length of stay at select parks between July 1 and the Saturday of the Labour Day long weekend.\n\nWhy they are making the change\n\nOntario Parks heard from countless visitors how frustrating it can be to miss out on a summer camping reservation. With reservations in high demand, it can be difficult to get a campsite at some of the park campgrounds.\n\nWith this change, they are giving more people the opportunity to go camping. Reducing the maximum length of stay at some of the parks will help provide more people with the chance to camp and experience Ontario Parks.\n\nHere’s what’s changing\n\nAt select parks, they are be reducing the maximum length of stay from 23 nights to seven or 14 nights for campground sites during our busiest camping season, starting in 2023.\n\nThe reduced maximum length of stay applies to trips between July 1 and the Saturday of the Labour Day long weekend. Outside of these dates, the maximum stay will be 23 nights.\n\nBooking five months in advance? Don’t worry. When you’re reserving your July stay in February, this change will be in effect.\n\nNote: This change will not impact backcountry camping or roofed accommodations.\n\nFind more information about our reservation rules and regulations.\n\nWhat about people who want to camp for longer?\n\nOntario Parks does understand that this change may be disappointing to those who usually enjoy camping for longer periods of time. We want to give more people the opportunity to camp and make their own memories at our parks.\n\nIf you prefer a longer stay, try:\n\nvisiting one of the many parks with a maximum stay of 23 nights\n\nroad-tripping from park to park\n\nbooking an off-season stay when the maximum reverts to 23 nights.\n\nWhich parks will have reduced maximums?\n\nThe changes will be in effect at these parks:\n\nMaximum 7-night stay:\n\nAlgonquin Provincial Park\n\nBon Echo Provincial Park\n\nKillbear Provincial Park\n\nSandbanks Provincial Park\n\nPinery Provincial Park\n\nMaximum 14-night stay:\n\nArrowhead Provincial Park\n\nAwenda Provincial Park\n\nBalsam Lake Provincial Park\n\nBass Lake Provincial Park\n\nBlue Lake Provincial Park\n\nBonnechere Provincial Park\n\nCharleston Lake Provincial Park\n\nChutes Provincial Park\n\nCraigleith Provincial Park\n\nDarlington Provincial Park\n\nDriftwood Provincial Park\n\nEarl Rowe Provincial Park\n\nEmily Provincial Park\n\nEsker Lakes Provincial Park\n\nFairbank Provincial Park\n\nFinlayson Point Provincial Park\n\nFitzroy Provincial Park\n\nFushimi Lake Provincial Park\n\nGrundy Lake Provincial Park\n\nHalfway Lake Provincial Park\n\nInverhuron Provincial Park\n\nIvanhoe Lake Provincial Park\n\nKap-Kig-Iwan Provincial Park\n\nKettle Lakes Provincial Park\n\nKillarney Provincial Park\n\nLake St. Peter Provincial Park\n\nLake Superior Provincial Park\n\nLong Point Provincial Park\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park\n\nMara Provincial Park\n\nMarten River Provincial Park\n\nMcRae Point Provincial Park\n\nMikisew Provincial Park\n\nMississagi Provincial Park\n\nMurphys Point Provincial Park\n\nNagagamisis Provincial Park\n\nNeys Provincial Park\n\nOastler Lake Provincial Park\n\nPancake Bay Provincial Park\n\nPoint Farms Provincial Park\n\nPort Burwell Provincial Park\n\nPresqu’ile Provincial Park\n\nQuetico Provincial Park\n\nRainbow Falls Provincial Park\n\nRene Brunelle Provincial Park\n\nRestoule Provincial Park\n\nRideau River Provincial Park\n\nRock Point Provincial Park\n\nRondeau Provincial Park\n\nRushing River Provincial Park\n\nSamuel de Champlain Provincial Park\n\nSauble Falls Provincial Park\n\nSelkirk Provincial Park\n\nSharbot Lake Provincial Park\n\nSibbald Point Provincial Park\n\nSilent Lake Provincial Park\n\nSilver Lake Provincial Park\n\nSix Mile Lake Provincial Park\n\nSleeping Giant Provincial Park\n\nSturgeon Bay Provincial Park\n\nTurkey Point Provincial Park\n\nWheatley Provincial Park\n\nWindy Lake Provincial Park\n\nMaximum 23-night stay:"
