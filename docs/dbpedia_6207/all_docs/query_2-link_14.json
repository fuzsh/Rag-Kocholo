        "text": "Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, a Swim Drink Fish initiative, inspires and stokes water watchers. It safeguards swimmable, drinkable, fishable water for everyone in Lake Ontario’s watershed through grassroots participation. It encourages people to document observations while spending time on the water.\n\nRecreational Water Monitoring Hubs in Toronto and Kingston, ON are both hosted by Lake Ontario Waterkeeper. The Toronto Monitoring Hub was established in 2016 by Swim Drink Fish. The Toronto Hub currently monitors 8 different locations along the Toronto shoreline. Volunteer citizen scientists work with the hub coordinator to sample in the Toronto Inner Harbour twice a week during the swimming season and external monitors samples weekly on Toronto Island and Humber Bay. In 2019 over 500 volunteers helped to sample the waters at four locations along the Inner Harbour waterfront. To get involved with the Toronto Monitoring Hub, sign up to volunteer and look for the volunteer posting for Toronto.\n\nThe Kingston Monitoring Hub was established in 2020 by Swim Drink Fish. The Lake Ontario Waterkeeper organization has a long history of involvement with water-related projects in Kingston – the first Lake Ontario Waterkeeper boat launched from Kingston in 2001 – and the creation of the Recreational Water Monitoring Hub is an extension of its ties with the Kingston community.\n\nWith the help of several volunteer citizen scientists, the Kingston Hub monitored Olympic Harbour Beach and Hospital Beach weekly during the 2020 season. In 2021, the Hub will add a third monitoring site – the shoreline at Doug Fluhrer Park in Kingston’s Inner Harbour. Water samples from these sites are analyzed at the Hub’s lab, located at the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes at Portsmouth Olympic Harbour. Kingston’s Recreational Water Monitoring Hub was established with funding from Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Great Lakes Protection Initiative. To get involved with the Kingston Recreational Water Monitoring Hub, sign up to volunteer and look for the volunteer job posting Kingston.\n\nBoth the Toronto Hub and the Kingston Hub are Swim Drink Fish citizen science monitoring hubs that received funding by Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Great Lakes Protection Initiative.\n\nContact\n\nphone: 1 (416) 861-1237\n\nfacebook: facebook.com/LakeOntarioWaterkeeper\n\ntwitter: twitter.com/LOWaterkeeper\n\naddress: 600 Bay Street Toronto, ON M5G 1M6\n\nAs of 2018:"
