        "text": "FAQs\n\nWhat is a fellowship?\n\nThe role of a fellow is multi-faceted. In working within a host organization for a year, fellows are full-time employees that add capacity, perspectives, and skills to teams and meaningful projects. At the same time, a fellowship also offers unique opportunities to balance experiential learning, exposure, and professional development with work products and networking – both as an individual and together with a cohort of peers. In 2024, the one-year fellowship program begins on Aug. 1.\n\nWhat benefits and opportunities are generally included as part of the fellowship?\n\nOver the course of their program year, Public Service Fellows receive compensation and access to insurance, retirement, and PTO/sick days as aligned with full-time employment at their host organization. Training and professional development days are coordinated for the entire cohort an average of 14 hours per month. These sessions have focused on topics such as communications, network management, racial equity and inclusion, leadership, and more. Fellows select and then work individually with an executive coach for 5 sessions. Informally, there are also opportunities to network, attend local forums and events, meet with alumni, and conduct informational interviews. It is important to note that, while general compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities will be coordinated across fellows, there may be some differences based upon an individual’s host organization, project, and scope of work for the year.\n\nAre the host agencies different every year? How are they selected?\n\nYes, the host agencies vary every year following an application, screening, and selection process. Organizations need to have a meaningful and robust project that a fellow would be able to move forward over the course of a year well as the capacity to offer ongoing supervision, mentoring, and access to leadership. Beyond this, the timeliness or urgency of a project, skills required of a fellow, and geography or population(s) served may also be considered holistically.\n\nWhat is the selection process for fellows?\n\nThere are three general steps in the selection process for applicants:\n\nInterested candidates complete a general application for the program. Applications are screened with a focus on alignment with eligibility requirements, commitment to public service, indicated skills, and writing.\n\nSemi-finalist interviews are conducted with candidates to learn more about their individual goals, prior experiences, and the host organizations that they believe are best aligned with their skills and interests. These interviews are facilitated by Cleveland Foundation staff, alumni of the program, and/or community leaders with time reserved at the end of questions. Full position descriptions and the names of interviewers will be shared in advance of this stage.\n\nFinalist interviews are coordinated directly by host organizations. This stage provides an opportunity for candidates to meet directly with organization staff that they may be working with, to learn more about the project(s) for the year, and to ask specific questions related to the position and workplace. Each finalist candidate is guaranteed an interview with at least one host organization.\n\nWhat generally characterizes the most successful fellowship experiences?\n\nWe encourage participants to continue to reflect upon their individual goals and objectives as they “carve out” their own fellowship experience. Generally, fellows tend to maximize their engagement with the program when they are open to new opportunities – even those that are slightly outside their comfort zone, invest in meeting and building relationships with new people, and remain committed to learning and growth.\n\nWhat are some examples of fellows’ transitions at the end of their program year?\n\nPlease reach out to alumni on LinkedIn to ask this question directly as paths vary widely! At least 50% of fellows transition to full-time employment either at their host organization or within another agency in Cleveland. Fellows may also pursue graduate studies or law school, move on to other fellowship programs, remain based in Cleveland but work remotely (or vice versa), or pursue career opportunities in other cities across the U.S. (still largely with a focus on public service).\n\nSamia Azizuddin, City of Cleveland – Planning\n\nSamia is a recent graduate from Cleveland State University, studying Urban and Regional Studies and Political Science, with minors in French and Women’s and Gender Studies.
