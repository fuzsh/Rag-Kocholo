        "text": "Awesome Grains & Seeds: A Garden to Kitchen Guide, which includes 50 Vegetarian Recipes, by Dan Jason and Michele Genest (Madeira Park, B.C.: Douglas & McIntyre, 2018) 208 pp. paper. Indexed. 100 full colour photos throughout. Canadian $24.95.\n\nIn the \"Foreword\" by Carol Pope, Associate Editor, we are introduced to how ancient grains and seeds are managed, then learn about how we can grow them for ourselves and ensure sustainable living. Readers may prefer to source them from a local market. There are quick-to-fix and more elaborate special occasion meals, all vegetarian and family friendly, some international dishes. Jason, in the Preface, shares his some thirty-years of experience, with crops, heritage grains, a precious heritage from past generations.\n\nOur diet has to do with carbon footprint and greenhouse-gas emissions. Organic plants are grown without biocides and synthetic fertilizers, in home gardens or on acreages. Sowing of them is said to be easy. Saving seeds is also simple. Harvesting is done by hand, threshing follows. The basic seeds and grains are: amaranth, barley, buckwheat, flaxseed; styrian pumpkin seeds, quinoa, soybeans, and wheat. The section on \"Soaking and Sprouting Grains and Seeds\" contains step-by-step instructions. An example is \"10 Steps to Sprouts\" and \"How to Grind Flour\". The Recipes range from: Breakfast, Appetizers, Soups; Hearty Salads and Main Dishes; Breads, Flatbreads, and Crackers; cookies, cakes, bars, and desserts. The instructions for \"Pumpkin Seed Butter Cookies\" were adapted from The Joy of Cooking's Peanut Butter Cookie recipe and this one contains no peanuts. There are extensive Endnotes for online sources and a Gardening Index.\n\nIn addition to Jason's Salt Spring Seeds Cookbook, he has written Some Useful Wild Plants; The Whole Organic Food Book, Saving Seeds as if Our Lives Depended on It; and The Power of Pulses: Saving the World with Peas, Beans, Chickpeas, Favas, and Lentils (Douglas & McIntyre, 2016).\n\nGenest is the author of two cookbooks, The Boreal Gourmet and The Boreal Feast (Lost Moose, 2010 and 2014). She was dining editor of enRoute Magazine. She writes a regular cooking column for Yukon, North of Ordinary Magazine.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nOctober 2018\n\nA Field Guide to Insects of the Pacific Northwest, by Robert Cannings (Madeira Park, B.C.: Harbour Publishing, 2018) pamphlet folder, 10 pp. paper Canadian $7.95.\n\nThe basics of What is an Insect, How do Insects Grow, and Why are Insects So Important are prologue to an assisted study of insects in their natural habitat. The reader will find about fifty of the common insect types, such as silver fish, mayflies, damselflies and dragonflies; darners, rock crawlers, cockroaches and termites; earwigs, and many others. The proper nomenclature for each is offered, as well as habitat, distinguishing features, if any, and full colour photo identification. The omission of five orders of insects was a conscious choice. Their species are rare or hard to see. Among them are jumping bristletails, parasitic lice, and bark lice. Thrips, twisted-winged insects, and fleas are mentioned only in passing. This eight-fold field guide is an introductory companion for those who wish to pursue more information about insects, representing eighty-percent of the 1.5 million named species of animals.\n\nDr. Robert Cannings, who has devoted his life to the study of entomology, is Curator Emeritus of Entomology at the Royal British Columbia Museum. He has written several books on insects, Introducing the Dragonflies of British Columbia and the Yukon; Checklist of the Lepidopters of British Columbia, Dragonflies of Conservation Concern in Northern British Columbia. The latter was with a systematic review, in a joint study, for the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund and the Ministry of Environment, since dragonflies are among his favourites.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nOctober 2018\n\ncalgary city of animals, edited by Jim Ellis (Calgary Institute for the Humanities & University of Calgary Press, 2017) 125 pp., notes, works cited, sepia and full colour photographs throughout, paper or available as an e-book, open access PDF 144 pp.\n\nWe would like to extend an invitation for you to join us at the Calgary Institute for the Humanities 37th annual Community Forum CALGARY: CITY OF ANIMALS, which takes place April 29, 2016. This year's forum brings three outstanding Canadian scholars from the fields of history, animal studies, and geography together with members of the Calgary community, to explore the roles that non-human animals have played and continue to play in the life of our city. The seminar will think about how our interaction with animals has shaped Calgary, and the traces they have left on the city's geography and identity. We the routes that animals have taken through the city, and the places where they currently live. We will think about the different ways we categorize urban animals ‒ wild and domestic, livestock and entertainers ‒ and consider the implications of these categories. Most importantly, we will think about the implications of seeing the city as an ecosystem that includes animal life, and the implications of seeing humans as one animal among many in the urban environment.\n\nAs President of the Friends of Nose Hill Society, I was an observer and avid participant in the 2016 seminar which prompted this collection of essays. Lunchtime discussions at our table centred on \"Silence of the song dogs\" on the decline of wildlife near the University due to ongoing development of campus land for commercial purposes. A table mate begged to differ and praised the care of animals in the Stampede rodeos from her first-hand experience. Another observation was the choice of luncheon menu: meat eaters, vegetarian, vegan. When a City representative recommended slaughtering the goats after an invasive plant species pilot programme, and providing the meat to corporate sponsors, there was an audible and collective gasp in the room. Someone commented, \"After the animals work hard and well over the summer, then they are butchered?!\"\n\nSince I represent a group of stakeholders \"Friends of Nose Hill\" in effect I also bring with me \"Citizens for Nose Hill\", longstanding members who are responsible for preservation and conservation of the Park.\n\nI should add that they have more than a passing interest in the Durban Accord and implementation of the City's ten-year Biodiversity Strategy. One of our members is engaged in advocacy about light pollution on ecosystems through the Dark Sky Preserves, Urban Star Parks Nocturnal Preserves, and International Dark Sky designations. Another is a proponent of the Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society. Editor Jim Ellis is Professor of English and Director of the Calgary Institute for the Humanities at the University of Calgary. He has written widely on art, literature and film and has served on the boards of Truck Gallery and Calgary Cinematheque. Ellis draws on the City's ten-year biodiversity strategy, in his Introduction. \"How do we categorize the different animals that live among us (pets, livestock, entertainers, pests?) what does it mean to think of humans as one animal among many in an urban biosphere?\" Generally, municipalities in the nineteenth century managed many aspects of Public Health concerns through regulations and a series of bylaws. However, the growing population of wild urban animals, including raccoons, coyotes, and rats meant livestock and wildlife interactions increased but were not one of the considerations.\n\nAccording to \"how canadians used to live with livestock in cities\" there was a pilot project, in Edmonton, on Urban Hen Keeping with the River City Chickens Collective. In 2014, eighteen of the nineteen sites were found to be compliant with bylaws and regulations. Six of the sites received animal control complaints. There were none over predatory wildlife, such as coyotes. In the second phase, the program was renewed and expanded.\n\nIn 1919, the Stampede excluded events designed for animals \"to bleed, pass out, break legs, or lose body parts (horns) before an audience (although all of these things happened occasionally anyway.\" (p. 17) (\"outlaw horses & the true spirit of calgary in the automobile age\") The contributor Susan Nance is said to be working on a new book, Born to Buck: Rodeo, Animals, and the Myths of the West. As a historian of animals and of live entertainment, she offers a case study of \"Greasy Sal\" a grey mare, in relation to the Calgary Stampede, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, insofar as this pertains to horses \"employed\" there as \"outlaw\" bucking stock. The rodeo was (and is) stylized to bring urban and rural together for entertainment purposes and commerce.\n\nArtist Yvonne Mullock's installation \"Dark Horse\" at Stride Gallery ran from June 3 to July 15, 2016, overlapping the dates of the Calgary Stampede. In \"Her Dark Materials\", Ellis observes that the crushed stetson, a key symbol of the cowboy and the west, could be interpreted as a sign of the horse's revenge. Horses have been used for entertainment purposes. See also: \"Yvonne Mullock and the New Stampede Aesthetics\", an interview by Leah Sandals, in Canadian Art, Summer, 2016.\n\nAre animals found in cities (except for pets) interlopers or pests? Culling coyotes to keep green spaces safe is not only ineffective but upsets the predator/prey balance of nature. This view extends to raccoons, beavers, skunks, and others, such as white-tailed deer, Richardson's ground squirrels, and Canada Geese.\n\nShelley Alexander, a professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Calgary, researches Animal Geography, Geospatial Analysis, Human Dimensions of Wildlife, and Road Ecology. (www.ucalgary.ca/canid-lab) She has over twenty-five years of experience studying wolves and coyotes, with Compassionate Conservation, non-invasive methods in wildlife research.\n\nIn \"silence of the song dogs\", Alexander imagines a more tolerant society, beginning with understanding coyote ecology in the city, rather than blindly accepting what the media reports, so we can foster a different approach to co-evolution, coexistence, and even co-flourishing. Her research explores the animal as \"trickster, song dog, shape-shifter, and creator\", while also acknowledging its rapid and routine execution across North America. Leg-hold traps are no solution for zones of human settlement (whether city, agricultural, hinterland). From coyote ecology, she indicates three key conflict drivers: during the pup-rearing season (April-June); ravines, river valleys, or small green spaces; areas in which coyotes ate more garbage.\n\nGus Yaki is an eighty-four-year-old birder who leads nature lovers on walking trips and fundraises for conservation groups across the country. Now retired, he operated Nature Travel Service guiding participants on wildlife viewing around the world. Yaki will speak in Calgary at the Edworthy Park Heritage Society at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 15. He is a nominee for a new Calgary Award called the Top 7 Over 70 and the gala is Oct. 2. (www.top7over70.com) Angela Waldie's account of his monthly Elbow River Bird Survey is based on her first-hand experience. There is a diversity of species despite noise, invasive species, and habitat loss. Waldie teaches at Mount Royal University. Her PhD research focused on species endangerment and extinction in literature. Her first poetry collection A Single Syllable of Wild explores wildlife practices in the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks.\n\nAny artificial light disrupts nature and is a new environmental concern, due to melatonin hormone production. Light at night impacts foraging patterns due to light attraction or avoidance, reduces the ability of some species to find mates; inhibits the ability of birds, insects, mammals, and humans to use the stars, and interferes with the natural circadian rhythms.\n\nSandy Cross Conservation Area, (ASCCA) is a 4,800-acre day-use natural area. Originally a ranch, the donated land is a conservation area for the protection of native wildlife habitat; provides space for native species of wildlife; and offers conservation education programs that do not jeopardize wildlife and habitat (\"light pollution in an animal city\", by Maureen Luchsinger and Laura Griffin, educators about a love of the natural environment).\n\nASCCA was Canada's first Nocturnal Preserve, in 2015, led by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC). Dark Sky Programs, Nocturnal Preserves, and International Dark Sky (IDA) designations are an integral part of ecosystem health. RASC differs from the IDA in several areas. One of the more basic differences involves the requirements for the designations.\n\nThe RASC developed specific lighting guidelines that significantly reduce the ecological impact of artificial light at night (ALAN). It was then discovered that \"what is good for the ecology is also good for astronomers\". The RASC Guidelines for Outdoor Lighting (GOL) are based on nocturnal biology, animal behaviour, and human vision. As such it differs significantly from typical urban lighting. The IDA adopted these Guidelines but compliance is not required for IDA designations.\n\nThis highlights a second difference between the RASC and IDA. The IDA allow urban lighting in their Dark Sky Places, whereas the RASC required a different character of lighting. This makes it more difficult to achieve compliance with the RASC-GOL and its Programs.\n\nThank you to Robert Dick RASC-LPAC and Roland Dechense, in Calgary, a senior member of the National and LPA Committee for these comments:\n\nWe agree with the IDA that being in a city, Nose Hill would not qualify as a Dark Sky Preserve. However, the RASC has developed a program for urban Parks ‒ called the Urban Star Park Designation. There is no difference from the DSP except an USP has a brighter sky glow component. Otherwise the GOL has the same ALAN requirements, or restrictions.\n\nSean Kheraj produces Nature's Past: Canadian Environmental History Podcast and is also the author of Inventing Stanley Park: An Environmental History. In \"how canadians used to live with livestock in cities\", he points to the fact that Calgary City Council has twice rejected pilot programmes for raising urban chickens, or practising urban livestock husbandry. However, there is currently a pilot programme for goat herding, whereby invasive plant species (commonly known as \"weeds\") are controlled from spreading. Ellis, alludes to this purpose in his \"Introduction\". I should add that, to its credit, City administration has devoted some time to researching how permits and zoning might be amended to permit urban grazing by farm animals in Calgary (outside Confederation Park.) There are community gardens and even human foraging activities proposed to augment other sources of food.\n\nHowever, this spirited initiative does not, at least at this time, extend to supporting domestic urban livestock within the City boundaries. In 1993, when I was elected President of my Community Ranchlands, I was made aware of a little-known clause in the legislation that one could be fined for permitting one's rooster to crow before daybreak. This has since been eliminated and replaced by the Responsible Pet Owner's Bylaw. Ranching of horses was once situated next to the University of Calgary. Horses were boarded on Nose Hill. There were feral dogs, in 1978, which roamed in packs, while jack rabbits, coyotes, hawks, and other wildlife still abound in Northwest Calgary.\n\nMohammad Sadeghi Esfahlani is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication, Media, and Film at the University of Calgary. His research includes new social movements, social innovation, and energy systems transformations. As Acting Project Manager for the Calgary Institute for Humanities, Esfahlani organized the 34th Community Seminar, in 2016. He offers background research in humanities literature, concerning animals, and our relationship with them. His essay spans the development of critical animal studies; its background, scholarship, and institutions. \"Critical: Animal Studies\" as an academic discipline, has a strong affinity with feminism, post-colonial theory, ecofeminist writings of the 1970s and 1980s. Other applications are to radical environmentalists, renceadicalism, how exploitation of animals is related to dominant categories of gender, race, and class. From this discourse, he moves on to \"Practical issues: problems and solutions\". Among them are: \"The Animal Industrial Complex\" and capitalist societies, where vivisection and experimentation are practiced. At lunch, participants overwhelmingly chose the vegan option.\n\nAndrea Hunt, Executive Director, and Jenna McFarland, Animal Care Operations Manager both work at the Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society. Together, they oversee four hundred species of wild animals, since 1993; specifically the injured and orphaned animals, for example, Canada geese, white-tailed jackrabbits, mallards, robins, magpies, and crows. With caring for two thousand animal patients a year in their nonprofit hospital, they concur that, yes, the striped skunk, Richardson ground squirrel, and others such as the beaver are well worth protecting. (\"wild animals in the city\")\n\nIn terms of the arts and other genres, One Yellow Rabbit Performance offers \"Calgary,/ I Love You, but You're Killing Me\" at their 30th High Performance Rodeo in 2016. Paul Hardy is an internationally recognized fashion designer. \"Kaleidoscopic animalia\", an exhibition designed and curated by Hardy, was made possible by Melanie Kjorlien, Vice President Access, Collections and Exhibitions, at the Glenbow Museum. Hardy was artist in residence for 2015. There were images of the fur trade, brand products, Haida carvings, \"beastly fetishes\" of mother-of-pearl, feathers, leather, buffalo hide, and tortoiseshell. Exotic animals were featured in circus posters from the Glenbow Archives, becoming popular in the late 1800s.\n\nFor \"becoming insects: a new universe\" Kimberly Cooper, the Artistic Director of Decidely Jazz Dance Works, took inspiration from cockroaches, dung beetles, scorpions, spiders, dragonflies, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, ants, wasps, stick insects, flies, and the praying mantis. Lisa Brawn, a Calgary-based artist, has worked in a variety of media, including installation art, and she paints graphic images or woodcut portraits. One group was of pop culture icons: movie monsters, country singers, artists, and musicians. The other major group are portraits of wild birds. Her works were featured on Calgary banners, in Calgary's Festival Hall. Her 2016 show combined exotic characters from film with wild birds. She presents woodcuts from her exhibitions in galleries across North America. She supplied the cover art, for purposes of calgary city of animals, with an interview and samples of her portfolio. In all, the artist mentions: magpies chickadees, crows, sparrows, pigeons; swallows, black birds, finches, ducks and gees; gulls, hawks, falcons, downy woodpeckers; northern flickers, waxwings, nuthatches, and robins.\n\nEllis concludes that Plato used animals to help define what it means to be human. He rejects the dichotomy of \"Cities are for people. Animals found in cities are interlopers or pests\". Rather, \"we are part of the animal world, and they are part of ours, since we share the same fate.\" Indeed.\n\nSome resources are on the website of the Calgary Institute for the Humanities at the University of Calgary. https://arts.ucalgary.ca/cih/news/calgary-city-animals.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nSeptember 28, 2017\n\nNature Place and Story: Rethinking Historic Sites in Canada, by Claire Elizabeth Campbell (Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2017) 214 pp. indexed, Endnotes (pp. 133-207) black and white photographs throughout. Cloth $34.95\n\nThe author draws on John Newlove, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Charles Dickens, Robert Kroetsch's Badlands. This book visits five historic landscapes across Canada, L'Anse aux Meadows, Grand Pré and the Annapolis Valley, Fort William, near Like Superior, the Forks of the Red River in Winnipeg, the Bar U Ranch in Alberta. Among the issues are climate change, agricultural sustainability, wilderness protection, urban reclamation, and oil and gas extraction. A synthesis of a national environmental history, a mari usqu ad mare, and a syllabus for \"A History of Canada\" are all important aims. The national historic sites system plan depends on human achievement rather than nature. National Parks have been described as cultural landscapes not wilderness. UNESCO represents heritage and environment.\n\nPublic memory, ideology, and human history are interrelated. The 1930 National Parks Act, The Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters, and Sciences during the 1950s, Centennial projects in the 1960s, park creation in the 1970s, 1980s' national Historic District, and a 1982 federal report on cultural resources are how our understanding has evolved. The Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places, in 2003, were subsequently revised. There are fewer historians at Parks Canada.\n\nThe Little Ice Ag was AD 1300-1850, preceded by the Medieval Warm Period. L'Anse aux Meadows is a national historic site and village, along with The Viking Trail, representing profitable heritage tourism. Grand Pré is a memorial to the Acadian deportation by the British before the Seven Years' War. Fort William was reconstructed but not until 1970-1975. The Historic Sites and Monuments Board was created in 1919 and the site designated in 1923. The Forks of the Red River in Winnipeg is Manitoba's most visited attraction and important in Western Canada. Parks Canada issued Ten Principles of Environmental Citizenship in 1995. The Bar U Ranch was established in 1882. It preserves an older view of the frontier. Ranching was part of colonization, capitalism, and modernity. This was the geography of displacement, the end of the buffalo hunt, removing indigenous species; replacing them, with large lease ranches. Calgary Stampede in 1912 was by the \"big four\" (two of whom owned the Bar U.) In the 1970s, there were heritage projects. Turner Valley required remediation for hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Fescue is the provincial grass of Alberta, since 2003. The language of \"tar sands\", economic exploitation, and the arc \"of hope and ruin\" are reserved for Calgary. Then, environmental citizenship and stewardship replaced by marketing for adventure, wedding venues.\n\nClaire Elizabeth Campbell is an associate professor of history at Bucknell University, a private liberal arts college along the West Branch Susquehanna River, in the town of Lewisburg, in central Pennsylvania\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nSeptember 29, 2017\n\nSome Useful Wild Plants: A Foraging Guide to Food and Medicine from Nature, by Dan Jason (Madeira Park, B.C.: Harbour Publishing, 2017) revised edition, illustrations by Robert Inwood, 192 pp, paper, $16.95\n\nThis guide was originally published in 1971, with plants found in the B.C. Interior, then expanded to North America. Jason lives on Salt Spring Island, B.C. where he operates Salt Spring Seeds and wrote The Power of Pulses (Douglas & McIntyre, 2016) with Hilary Malone and Alison Malone Eathorne. Some food uses of palatable plants are to be found here in recipes for tea, beer, soup, salad, or ground, as syrup, and in wine. Medical uses range from athlete's foot, ear ache, indigestion, ulcers, sore throat, warts, and wounds. However, the author cautions that St. John's wort contains a phytotoxim or phototoxic called hypericin that causes photosensitivity when exposed to strong sunlight. Other uses are as a dye, fibre, insect repellent, scent, shampoo, soap, and tooth cleanser. The compact field guide is organized by types of plants, Herbs & Shrubs, Berries, Seaweeds, Trees, and poisonous; with an Appendix and Index of Plants. There is some overlapping, for example, with berries only a few are described in a discrete section. Seaweeds are attached marine algae; there are five hundred species identified near the B.C. coast. Jason delineates Pacific kelp, in addition to brown, green and red versions of algae. (There is an alert for blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, a fluorescent scum.) The book has an extensive section on trees: the alder, birch, cedar, cherry, fir, hazel, and hemlock. Mountain hemlock and Western hemlock are promoted, not Water hemlock which is poisonous. Furthermore, he examines juniper, pine, poplar, spruce, and willow. First Nations used syrup from the poplar bark for setting fractures. The major focus is devoted to Herbs & Shrubs, beginning with Alfalfa, a cough remedy; Goldenrod, a dye; Skullcap, a member of the mint family; Vanilla Leaf, and Watercress. A typical entry delineates where a plant can be found; a description of its appearance or characteristics; nutritional value, and common uses. Whether you seek tea or a broth; an astringent and tonic; pain reliever or even a hair tonic; the ubiquitous Yarrow Achillea millefolium Astraceae is recommended. While First Nations chewed the leaves or boiled the roots of the Gumweed Grindelia spp. for a stomach tonic, today Western medicine recognizes its anti-spasmodic effects similar to atropine. The black-and-white line drawings are attractive and together with the straight forward text represent a sample selection from the over seven hundred varieties of plants the author maintains. The addendum suggests further research, since many food and medicinal plants could not be included. Some of these are less useful, uncommon, or could easily be confused with look-alike poisonous plants. He lists seventeen in this category. However, the author observes that there is probably more danger from cultivated plants and vegetables (their leaves, sprouts, seeds, and pits). The most delicious berries can be eaten raw though others are unpalatable. Water hemlock is more dangerous than lobelia and wild tobacco. Baneberry, a member of the buttercup family, contains a poison. Avoid nightshade in all its varieties. Death camas can be mistaken for camas and wild onion.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nSeptember 29, 2017\n\n100 Easy-to-Grow Native Plants for Canadian Gardens, by Lorraine Johnson, (Madeira Park, B.C.: Douglas & McIntyre, 2017) Revised third addition, full colour photographs throughout by Andrew Leyerle 160 pp. paper. $26.95.\n\nA native plant is one that grew in a region prior to European settlement. Not all wildflowers are native. Non-native can be exotics, aliens, introduced species, and weeds. The aims and aspirations of growing native plants can be summarized as supporting a complex web of ecological relationships as the basis of a healthy, resilient ecosystem. In short, \"Dig in ‒ the roots of change need to be anchored deep...\".\n\nNearly ninety plants in a number of categories are represented, with a useful series of terms, such as common and botanical names, height, blooming period, exposure; moisture, habitat, range, description, maintenance and requirements; propagation, good companions, related species, wildlife, and finally miscellany, \"a catch-all category for tidbits.\"\n\nJohnson is a prolific author on green future, composting, urban food growing, and wild, naturalized gardening. The topics are organized with a Foreword, List of Entries, Introduction, 100 Easy-to-Grow Native Plants; Ethical Gardener's Guidelines, Propagation, Plants for Specific Conditions: Quick-Reference Charts, Resources, and Index of Plants by Botanical Name.\n\nThe Guidelines are reprinted from the North American Native Plant Society. Among them, we are advised to keep accurate records, obtain permission before transplanting, do not disrupt native plant communities; attract birds, butterflies, and moths; and share your knowledge through public education.\n\nIn this edition, there is more information about native plants in relation to native bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects and pollinators. In the section on \"Propagation\", the author admits that starting plants from seed does take patience and there are some special requirements, especially for ferns. The alphabetical charts pertain to specific conditions for a variety of areas. Some are Woodland, Meadow, Prairie, Northwest, and Northeast. Others must have drought-tolerance; there are dry and acidic soils, deep shade, moist areas, and to attract butterflies and other such pollinators.\n\nAs the author suggests, there are hundreds of other plants native to your region, so consult a field guide, join a native plant organization, visit a local garden, or ask for information. She recommends three online sources: the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada, the USDA Plants Database, and E-Flora B.C.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nSeptember 29, 2017\n\nThe Birder's Guide to Vancouver and the Lower Mainland: An Essential Companion for Birders Exploring the Metro Vancouver Area, edited by Colin Clasen, Revised and Expanded Edition, Nature Vancouver (Madeira Park, B.C.: Harbour Publishing, 2016) 272 pp. Indexed, paper $26.95.\n\nThere are an estimated 450 bird species in Canada, of which more than 400 are found in the Metro Vancouver area (in 33 unique habitat areas). Nature Vancouver was previously known as Vancouver Natural History Society. The goals are to enjoy, study, and protect nature in Vancouver and throughout B.C., as well as to educate its members and the public. Activities include habitat restoration, a Christmas bird count, raptor survey, coast bird survey, and a Wildlife Tree Stewardship program.\n\nThis new and expanded edition, with more than 100 additional colour photographs, is organized by places: Vancouver, North and West Vancouver, Fraser Delta, Burnaby, Fraser Valley, Straight of Georgia (part of the Salish Sea). Other topics are the seasonal status and a select list of Vancouver Bird Species, online resources, reporting tagged or banded birds, photography etiquette, reporting harassment, nature organizations, transit and weather information, tides, black bears, cougars, and other wildlife.\n\nThe \"Foreword\" is by George Clulow, President of the B.C. Ornithologists, who also updated the \"Introduction.\" This is a new edition, since 2001, which was revised, updated, and rewritten. Nature Vancouver offers 150 field trips annually and this field guide is also useful for the tourist or vicarious traveler, because it is lushly supplied with full-colour photographs of birds and their habitats. The maps are excellent and directions clearly delineated.\n\nEach section is discrete with an introduction and detailed directions, with descriptions for each subsection. Overall, the approach is by locality, \"Which species can I expect to find in a particular area?\"\n\nThe section on \"Vancouver\" covers Stanley Park, Pacific Spirit Regional Park, Jericho Beach Park, Queen Elizabeth Park, and Fraser River Park. The section on \"North and West Vancouver\" covers Maplewood Conservation Area, Lighthouse Park, Ambleside Park, Lionsdale Quay; Mount Seymour Provincial Park, and Cypress Provincial Park.\n\nThe section on \"Fraser Delta\" covers George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Westham Island, Ladner Harbour Park, Tsawwassen Ferry Jetty, Brunswick Point; Point Roberts (Washington), Boundary Bay Regional Park, Serpentine Wildlife Area; Blackie Spit, Kwomais Point Park, Iona and Sea Islands, Lulu Island; Sturgeon Banks, Burns Bog Area, The Fraser River Delta Reserve.\n\n\"Burnaby\" covers the Lake Regional Park, Deer Lake Park, the Burnaby Mountain Conservation Area, the Fraser Foreshore Park, Barnet Marine Park. The \"Fraser Valley\" section covers Minnekhada Regional Park, Pitt-Addington March Wildlife Management Area, Colony Farm Regional Park, Brydon Lagoon, Campbell Valley Regional Park, and Golden Ears Provincial Park.\n\nThe \"Strait of Georgia\" covers birding from BC Ferries to Vancouver Island, the main ferry routes, as well as others.\n\nThe \"Seasonal Status of Vancouver Birds\" contains areas covered, a checklist divided into two parts: a list of 268 reported annually and 152 not reported every year. Some bird species are regularly occurring and others are only seasonal, casual, or accidental. There are helpful bar graphs for sightings A \"Selected List of (88) Vancouver Bird Species\" answers: \"Where can I find a particular species?\" Some are common in North America and others are not. For avid bird watchers, uncommon or rare species sightings locally (or rare and absent elsewhere) are desired. \"Online Resources\" send the reader to a (Yahoo Group) free online birding group with 600 members in VANBIRDS; in addition to \"eBird\" a free international online database, \"eBird Rare Bird Alert\", and \"BC Rare Bird Alert\", with a free blog, and regional reports (see: Vancouver and Fraser Valley at bcbirdalert.blogspot.ca).\n\nReporting wing-tagged and leg-banded birds of prey contains important contact information. Be ready with details, especially about public lawbreakers. Be respectful with a Code of Birding Ethics, and mindful of the Boundary Bay incident. There were onlookers harassing birds, using bait, loud sounds, and repeatedly flushing birds out. \"They have very little space left in which to feed and rest.\" (p. 253)\n\nThere are citations for nature-related organizations in the B.C. area, valuable online bird research information, hands-on research-based groups, rehabilitation and rescue groups; groups offering casual outings and nature information; public transit and weather information contacts; tides for watching water birds and shore birds. An article on black bears, cougars, and other wild animals indicates that we share the wilderness areas, so avoid such encounters whenever possible. There are additional references for further research.\n\nAll in all, The Bird's Guide to Vancouver and the Lower Mainland is an excellent and rewarding resource, whether for immediate use in the field by a birding specialist or casually consulted by the general public; in other words, for anyone who has even a passing interest in nature.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nCalgary Alberta\n\nJuly 31, 2016\n\nThe Calgary Herald (August 31, 2016, sec A, p. 2) reported on beekeepers who will be wearing their beekeeping suits when they take on the Canmore Quad Challenge. Their purpose is to raise funds and awareness about their Bee Aware AB project. (\"Couple to tackle race in beekeeping suits: Canadians seeks to raise awareness about declining bee populations.\") Another report claims \"Chestermere is the most bee-friendly city in the West.\" (Both articles were written by Volande Cole). This is a timely and topical subject in which there is definite public interest.\n\nAnother article about the perceived global glut of honey and questionable trading practices have driven the production costs up, while revenue has fallen. Statistics Canada estimates 95.3 million pounds of honey worth about $232 million were produced in 2015 (Alberta produced about half of that) 42.8 million pounds ‒ up 20 percent from 2014. (\"Honey producers feel sting of low prices\", Calgary Herald, Sept. 3, 2016, section C, pp. 1, 5.) An accompanying photo is of a local bee keeper near Innisfail.\n\nReview of Victory Gardens for Bees: A DIY [Do It Yourself] Guide to Saving the Bees, by Lori Weidenhammer (Madeira Park, B.C.: Douglas & McIntyre, 2016) 240 pp. paper Indexed. Full colour photographs throughout.\n\nEarly beekeeping occurred in northern Europe, so that now we can give back to nature by caring for our gardens, pastures, and other green spaces.\n\nBeekeeping during World War I was practiced by women to help feed their families and it came to be regarded as a \"gold rush\", until too many failed. Victory bee keeping alludes to World War II beekeepers who were allowed a sugar ration to feed their bees. It also invokes the sense of defence against Colony Collapse Disorder, although the practitioners of keeping bees need to be educated about competing interests of imported bees, with wild bees and other honeybees, for pollen and nectar.\n\nThis book is dedicated to future gardeners, farmers, and ecologists. The layout uses full colour captioned photographs, elaborate and decorative charts, inserts of pertinent information, pithy quotations, and observations on bee biodiversity.\n\nThe ten fulsome chapters deal with charts of weeds to leave for bees, bee plants with benefits, edible herbs for bees; vegetables for bees, new world natives, bee pasture plants; trees for bees, shrubs for bees, perennials for bees.\n\nIn \"Weeds to leave for Bees\" there is a seasonal planting chart, including plant origin, bloom period, hardiness, and bees attracted. \"Bee plants with benefits\" is a companion planting chart. \"Bees of all stripes\" promises the reader will \"become a bee spotter\". Healthy herbs for pollinators and people precedes \"Edible herbs for bees\" another seasonal planting chart, bee-licious edible gardens, and vegetables for bees. Those who venture afar will want to consult \"Wild for Indigenous Bees\" and learn more about nesting sites and materials; how to make a \"stumpery\" by collecting rotting wood stumps. Hollow stem \"hotels\" of twigs can replace Old Bee Logs or Cane Bundles which have been phased out. Beware of disease or microscopic pests. New World Natives, Bee Pasture, Trees for Bees, Shrubs for Bees offer more seasonal planting charts. Bee Hedgerows (deer resistant and bee rich) are dense borders of trees, shrubs, and vines. Eco-agriculturalists are turning to an ancient model of farming.\n\nThe penultimate chapter \"Victory Borders for Bees\" calls for a long-time commitment with a \"Perennials for Bees\" seasonal planting chart. \"Growing to Love Bees\" encourages a flight from indoor technology to community and family building outdoor pursuits.\n\nThis compendium is suitable for neophytes without a green thumb, as well as the mature and experienced. Anyone with an interest in joining the lifecycle of nature, of which we all form a part, in some manner or other. The text is readable, design engaging, and with more than enough suggestions.\n\nThe selection of sources contains inspiring and useful websites, helpful blogs; seed companies, online publications, useful and inspirational books.\n\nThe author is a Vancouver-based artist, from Cactus Lake, Saskatchewan. She appears in costume as The Queen Bee at schools and community events. She is a member of the Second Site Collective and Women Who Run with the Bees.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nPresident\n\nFriends of Nose Hill Society\n\nReview of Hiking Trails of Montréal and Beyond and Trails of Prince Edward Island, by Michael Haynes (Fredericton, N.B.: Goose Lane Editions, 2015) paper Indexed.\n\nThese compact companion guides are part of an extensive series on Nature and the Outdoors. The first-mentioned extends to Laval, Lanaudière, the Laurentians, Montérégie, and the Eastern Townships. There are fifty walking routes proximate to Montréal, ranging from city parks to wilderness treks, and the research resulted from preparation for the Hiking Trails of Ottawa. It contains a Glossary of French Hiking Terms to render the content accessible to Anglophone users. The Trans Terrebonne is part of the Trans Canada Trail network. Some unique features are the Lachine Canal National Historic Site, St. Lawrence River, Parc du Mont-Royal, Laurentian Highlands, and St. Lawrence Lowland. Indeed, the author alleges that the hiking trail network in Québec is far more extensive than anywhere else in Eastern Canada. There are more hiking trails proximate to Montreal \"than in any Canadian city east of Calgary,\" except, perhaps Quebec City. Surprisingly, the Québec park system is equaled only by that of British Columbia, \"if at all.\" (p. 10)\n\nGiven the context a hiker encounters the bad with the great: poison ivy and mosquitoes, white pine, red pine, purple aster, giant hogweed; larch, yellow birch, hemlock, sugar maple, chickadee, and the Great Blue Heron, wild turkey. Among the animals are: wolf, coyote, black bear, turkey vulture; thrush, grouse, turtle, pheasants, raccoon; woodpecker, moose, beaver, loon, deer, butterflies, and geese. There are web pages listed with resources on Outdoors Associations, Park/Trail Web Sites, Animals/Plants, General Interest, Weather, and details about cell phone coverage (or lack thereof).\n\nThe second volume includes Confederation Trail, Queens County, Kings County, and Prince Edward Island National Park. Web pages are current as of Dec. 2014, on Parks, Trails, and Outdoor Associations; General Interest, Animals/Plants, and cell phone coverage. There are fifty-six walking and biking routes, the entire Confederation Trail, at nearly 450 kms., is the only provincial portion of the Trans Canada Trail to be completed. Some unique features are: fox farming, lady's slippers, bald eagle, aster, owl, blueberries, blue jay, red elderberry, chickadee; white spruce, sugar maple, larch, ducks, grouse, blue heron, potato blossoms, hemlock; white pine, red pine, beaver. The coyote, \"the most recent wild animal to be classified as dangerous,\" p. 253) is cited among woodpecker, muskrats, \"singing sands one of the seven wonders of Canada.\" The Green Gables is a national historic site, paired with ticks, piping plover (of which there were eight breeding pairs in 2014); raccoon, poison ivy, loon, dunes; red fox, pheasants, mosquitoes, blue heron, and others.\n\nBoth trail guides contain engaging prefaces, informative introductions, maps, full-colour and black-and-white photographs, and come complete with assessments of their \"walkability\" and GPS coordinates. Some common features are the \"Trails at a Glance,\" permitted uses, website addresses (subject to change); \"Index of User Tips and Sidebar\" notes as capsule descriptions on some of the plants, animals, geological features, and human institutions, such as fraternal provincial hiking organizations you might want to encounter on the various trails.\n\nThere is a degree of interaction, since you can post comments on: http://hikingmontreal.blogspot.ca.where updates since Dec. 2012 are added.\n\nHaynes is the author of several bestselling trails guides, among them Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia, Hiking Trails of Cape Breton, Trails of Halifax Regional Municipality; Hiking Trails of Ottawa, the National Capital Region and Beyond, and numerous articles about Canada's outdoors. He is a regular contributor to CBC radio, has worked for numerous trail organizations, including \"Go for Green\" and the Nova Scotia Trails Federation. He is now the Director of TransActive Solutions and conducts workshops and presentations on trail development and use, in order to improve the \"walkability\" and \"bikeability\" of Canadian communities.\n\nSome other titles in the series are: Birding in New Brunswick, by Burroughs; Birds of a Feather, by Johns; Trails of Fredericton, by Thorpe; Trails of Greater Moncton, by Merlin; Hiking Trails of New Brunswick, by Eiselt; Waterfalls of New Brunswick, by Guitard; Woodland Canoeing, by Spakman.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of A History of the Nature Conservancy of Canada, by Bill Freedman (Toronto: Oxford University Press, 2013) 242 pp, cloth, Indexed.\n\nNatural is a term used in reference to the predominately non-human world or a reference to habitats or ecosystems that have developed unaided by humans and that are dominated by native species.\n\nThe present text charts the first five decades of the Nature Conservancy of Canada and concludes with the author's personal view of possible outcomes over the next several decades. A strategic plan for 2012-2017 was developed to consider a Business Model, the next level of Business, Conservation Planning, Direct Conservation Action; Non-traditional Regions for NCC Action in Canada, International Work, Influence and Outreach. Since insufficient financing could hinder these objectives, private-sector conservation initiatives and a larger community of donors will be sought.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC), or The Conservancy, is a nonprofit organization intended to conserve the natural world through land trusts, stewardship plans, and by creating protected areas in carefully selected places; and to make a difference to the survival of native species and natural ecosystems; to create more and larger protected areas. This preservation and sustainable conservation of extensive private lands are used to augment public lands as parks. NCC has a non-advocacy mandate, except for tax treatment of donations, legal and funding issues; operating in collaboration with philanthropists, foundations, companies, other environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs), and governmental agencies. One of the aims of land trusts is to acquire such areas and fund them, if possible, through voluntary taxation by donations to environmental charities.\n\nConservation is sustainable use of a renewable natural resource or stewardship of the habitat of native species and other natural values in ways that allow them to be sustained.\n\nWe are experiencing a modern biodiversity crisis, a mass extinction that is happening today and is being caused by anthropogenic influences, especially the destruction of natural habitats. There are: threats to the natural world, natural extinctions, resulting in this modern biodiversity crisis, with alien species and pathogens, nature is at risk in Canada.\n\nA protected area is a tract of natural habitat set aside from intensive economic use, such as a park, nature reserve, ecological reserve, or wilderness area. A special management area may be protected, but is usually of economic importance such that hunting, forestry, and some other extractive industries may be permitted.\n\nIn a brief Preface, the author surveys the near losses of the whooping crane, plains bison, and trumpeter swan. Is there a global biodiversity crisis, due to irresponsible economic development, given the loss of the passenger pigeon and the great auk? Others are: the Labrador duck, sea mink, deepwater cisco, eelgrass limpet; Macoun's shining moss, blue pike, and Queen Charlottes Islands caribou. Some of the information is culled from the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Among the species now locally extinct, or extirpated, are the Atlantic whale and the blue-eyed Mary. Of those at imminent risk of extinction or extirpation (in all but an important portion of their range) or known as endangered are: the Vancouver Island marmot, whooping crane, piping plover, and thread-leaved sundew. Classified as threatened, is a species that is likely to become endangered, unless factors affecting its risk are mitigated. Classified as: of special concern means a species is at risk of becoming threatened because of small or declining numbers or occurrence in a limited range (also as vulnerable). Some of the endangered are: the tall-grass prairie, a native grassland, of which less than 1 percent survives; the mixed-grass and short-grass depleted the Carolinian forest; dry open forest, dry coastal forest, semi-desert, old-growth forest, and natural communities of fish.\n\nConservation refers to the judicious use of renewable resources, animals and timber, with ecologically wise use. The history of the national park movement leads to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) under the United Nations program, 1993; and the Federal Species At Risk Act, 2003. Currently we have protected areas: parks, wilderness areas, ecological reserves, and comparable tracts. According to Freedman, there are 58 natural communities, with the rare tall-grass prairie, savannah woodland, southern hardwood forest, and various wetlands.\n\nNonprofit land trusts have a board of directors, own property, are independent, and entrepreneurial, with corporate structure, and intended conservation, as members of the Canadian Land Trust Alliance (CLTA), 2006. They work with willing landowners. A bargain sale is a land purchase for a price that is substantially less then the appraised value of the land and that usually results in a charitable tax receipt for the difference between the appraised value and the purchase price. This is what is known as a split-receipt transaction or other binding conservation agreement, associated with the appraised value, and controls the kinds of activities that can be undertaken on a property. Other factors to be considered are: a conservation covenant, conservation planning, and research.\n\nThe history of the NCC, from the beginning in 1962-71, is in Ontario and by 1962 the NCC is trustee-governed, as a no-share capital corporation (not-for-profit corporation) under the Canada Corporations Act, with charitable status under the Income Tax Act. Some of the aims are for education, to acquire land, and to solicit donations, etc. The author cites The Ontario Naturalist (1963) article.\n\nOf note is that, as early as 1937, there existed a privately-held Province of Quebec Society for the Protection of Birds (Bird Protection Quebec). The survey moves to: The Organization, 1972-80, when Xerox Canada offered a multi-year action plan, for the conservation program, followed in 1972-80, all culled from the minutes of board meetings, endowments, and matching funds.\n\nWorking from Coast to Coast to Coast, in 1990-97, the organization, and industry players were: Shell Canada, Amoco, Tembec, and World Wildlife Fund. They continued the campaign for conservation, 1998-2005. Paul Martin abolished capital gains taxes, which were changed to environmentally friendly tax legislation for land trusts.\n\nThe campaign for Conservation, 1998-2005, adopted The One Conservancy principle which is intended to ensure that the NCC is committed to assisting financially those regions with a lesser ability to raise the necessary revenues locally to achieve the Conservancy's mandate.\n\nThe outcome is that NCC has become a Force for Nature, 2006-2011. The Nature Conservancy of Canada \"at Fifty\" is examined thoroughly for governance, planning, securing of properties, stewardship, fundraising; communications with the general public, individual donors, high net-worth individuals, foundations, the Corporate Sector, governments, financial system, with a winning formula for success. In one graph we read of indicators to growth of the revenues and conserved areas of the NCC.\n\nThere are positive indications about \"Further down the road\" accompanying The Natural World's biophilia, hidden biodiversity, natural heritage or native species, alien species as biological pollution; of intrinsic or inherent value, bioresources, with full-colour photographs.\n\nIn addition there are: a helpful Glossary, Appendix 1: Members of the National Board of Directors of the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and Appendix 2: Chief Executive Officers of the Nature Conservancy of Canada.\n\nFreedman is an ecologist and professor in the Department of Biology at Dalhousie University and a long-term member of the Board of Directors of the Nature Conservancy of Canada, serving a term as it chair. He received a Career Achievement Award from the Canadian Council of University Biology Chairs (2007) and a Canadian Environment Award, Gold Medal Level, in the category of Community Awards for Conservation from the Geographic Society (2006).\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of Wilderness and Waterpower: How Banff National Park Became a Hydroelectric Storage Reservoir, by Christopher Armstrong and H.V. Nelles (University of Calgary Press, 2012) 286 pp. paper $34.95 Maps, photos, tables, appendix, notes, and indexed.\n\nAs this book went to press, the coauthors received a copy of Powering Generations: The TransAlta Story 1911-2011 (Calgary: TransAlta, 2011) by Robert Page and David A. French. A note says they had supplied the authors with pre-publication drafts of earlier versions of the present account which assisted them in their project. The beautifully illustrated account of the whole range of company activities provides context for the present focused examination of hydroelectric development by the company on the Bow.\n\nAn introduction parses path dependence, waterpower or hydropower, and wilderness. There are political ends of the spectrum on \"wilderness\"; this is augmented by founding of The Alberta Wilderness Association and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society.\n\nThe present authors contributed \"Car Parks: The Influence of Auto Tourism on Banff National Park, 1905-1918,\" in Alberta History (Winter 2008).\n\nThe authors acknowledge William Cronon's launch of the debate in one of his essays, in a collection he edited, on Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature (N.Y.: Norton, 1995). This essay was published in Environmental History, which provoked responses to the text, such that the influence of Cronon's essay can be tracked. The present text references Nature's Metropolis, Chicago and the Great West (N.Y.: Norton, 1996), by William Cronon.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to acknowledge the influence of this [Cronon] book, inspired as it is in part by the 'metropolitanism' tradition of Canadian historiography.\" (p. 230, note 13)\n\nHe loosely defines first nature as original, prehuman nature and second nature as the artificial nature that people erect atop first nature. He explores the interaction of the two natures (in the hinterland and in the city) under the dominion of urban capitalist commodity flows in separate chapters devoted to grain, lumber, and meat. (pp. 259-260, note).\n\nThey co-authored Monopoly's Moment: The Organization and Regulation of Canadian Utilities, 1830-1930 (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1986); also by Armstrong and Nelles, who coauthored Southern Exposure: Canadian Promoters in Latin America and the Caribbean, 1896-1930 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1988)\n\nThe duo researched The River Returns, in which they promised a forthcoming fuller treatment of the subtle and complicated matters, and are now able to offer extended coverage of the conflict between hydroelectric development and park policy.\n\nAs a result, they co-authored, with Matthew Evenden, The River Returns: An Environmental History of the Bow (Montreal and Kingston: McGill Queen's University Press, 2009).\n\nWhile Walter Hildebrandt released a brief guide, An Historical Analysis of Parks Canada and Banff National Park, 1968-1995 (Banff: Banff-Bow Valley Task Force, 1995), Armstrong and Nelles acknowledge there are polemical ends of the spectrum on parks policy. For example, a thesis that making a profit from tourism was more important then promoting preservation, is argued, in Parks for Profit, by Leslie Bella (Montreal: Harvest House, 1987). From a political science perspective, see: Paul Kopas, Taking the Air: Ideas and Change in Canada's National Parks (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 2007).\n\nFor ecological integrity, see: E.J. Hart's J.B. Harkin: Father of Canada's National Parks (Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 2011). E.J. Hart also produced two volumes, The Place of the Bows and The Battle for Banff (Banff: EJH Literary Enterprises, 1999 and 2003). A Parks Canada centennial collection of essays was edited by Claire Campbell, A Century of Parks Canada 1911-2011 (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2011).\n\nThe present study builds on the standard account of Canada's national parks policy in Fergus Lothian's four-volume A History of Canada's National Parks (Ottawa: Parks Canada, 1976).\n\nThis is number five in the Energy, Ecology, and the Environment Series.

According to the \"Foreword\", by the Chair of IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas, the number of protected areas globally exceeds 200,000; and covers over 14 percent terrestrially and over 1 percent of the world's oceans. Further expansion by 2020 will be 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Among the acknowledgements, the editors compare international peace parks with international, trans-boundary, collaborative efforts. A continuous ecological and cultural system connects the landscapes, cultures, and wildlife along and across the Rocky Mountains.\n\nQuinn offers an Introduction on the historical, jurisdictional, and geographical divisions of the Rocky Mountains, beginning with the indigenous Chief Mountain, Ninastakis, and Miistákis. Canada and the United States shared their common borders, boundaries, frontiers. There are four categories or divisions which align with the Parks for Peace in collaboration and partnership. In an overview, the locations of parks discussed in this volume are identified. There was a conference, in 2007, at the town of Waterton Park, which was impacted by security concerns since September 2001. There is a Conclusion devoted to securing a peace park between the United States and Mexico, under homeland security. One of the aspirations is that another such conference will be held. The chapters are organized into broad themes.\n\nSection 1 \"Lessons From The Field\".\n\nSection 2 \"The Southern African Experience\".\n\nSection 3 \"Education And International Peace Parks\"\n\nSection 4 \"Peace Park Proposals\", including the Peace Park between India and Pakistan in northern Kashmir in the western Himalayas; a demilitarized zone between North and South Korea; The Niagara International Peace Park as a legacy twenty-first century symbol.\n\nThe Notes on thirty-four Contributors serve to display their impressive credentials in a global context.

Sovada and Ludwig Carbyn (Regina, SK: Canadian Plains Research Centre, 2003) 236 pp. paper $39.95. Full colour cover, Indexed, black-and-white photographs.\n\nThere have been few incentives, in the past, for landowners to maintain wildlife habitat. The Nature Conservancy of Canada is an important component of wildlife and habitat conservation, in addition to the roles played by industry, business, government, and First Nations.\n\nOnly 25 to 30 percent of the prairie ecozone of Canada now consists of rangeland or grazing lands. It is estimated that as much as 14 percent of the 353 species at risk occur in the prairie ecozone. Public lands play a significant role in conservation. They also provide significant outdoor recreation and wildlife viewing opportunities.\n\nConservation of all grassland flora and fauna (since land use decisions and activities have largely neglected conservation of wildlife) must be bolstered by restoration efforts in parks management. The imperiled and depauperate status of grassland ecosystems and their species is a legacy of this neglect and the dramatic anthropogenic changes on the landscape.\n\n(Source: The Socio-Economic Context for Swift Fox Conservation in the Prairies of Canada, by David A. Gauthier and Daniel S. Licht)\n\nThe province of Alberta has been part of the success story of reintroducing the swift fox to the wilds. However, the methods and means of capturing wild species for purposes of scientific study will be of particular interest to Nose Hill and Calgarians, given the recent controversial leg-or-paw-hold trapping of coyotes (and some domestic dogs) in public parks (including Nose Hill, Fish Creek, and Bowmont) by University of Calgary researchers.\n\nSwift foxes were extirpated from Canada in the 1930s, but reintroduced since 1983, and their population by 1997 was approximately three hundred, which means they are still highly endangered. Of one-hundred-and-twenty-five individual animals trapped in 273 captures, fifty-three radio-collared foxes died during the study. There were no injuries (at least by sight), minor injuries, and no major injuries. Foxes were re-caught as frequently as six times in one trapping session and fourteen times over the course of the study. Table 1 demonstrates the number of swift fox captures, with no injury and with minor injury in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, from January 1995 to February 1998. Table 2 demonstrates comparative causes of mortality for radio-collared foxes in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, between January 1995 and February 1998 that experienced minor injuries versus those that did not.\n\nThe causes of death for injured and uninjured were: predators, human, starvation, and unknown agents. The maximum amount of time that injured foxes were in traps was longer than that of uninjured animals. These scholars recommend a test for stress in captured animals. For the study area, human habitation was sparse. Foxes resisted removal using the noose by bracing against the trap, biting the chord, or biting the trap. One field worker restrained the fox, while the other performed parasite counts, canine measurements, and body condition assessments. Foxes were sexed, ear tattooed, treated, and radio-collared, vaccinated; then checked for no external wounds, limb irregularities, tooth breakage, chipped teeth, broken claws sheaths, external lacerations, breakage or dislocations of limbs.\n\n(Source: Reducing Capture-Related Injuries and Radio-Collaring Effects on Swift Foxes, by Axel Moehrenschlager, et al.)\n\nCaptive breeding of the swift fox began in Canada in 1972, six years before the species was declared extirpated in Canada. The goal is to reproduce swift foxes for reintroduction into protected areas of their historic range. Swift foxes are largely monogamous and it was important that the pair bond be maintained; pairs should not be separated unnecessarily.\n\nSwift foxes have been bred in captivity for over twenty-five years, but little has been published on the methods or results of the program. Data was collected and obtained from the breeding records, and from daily observations of the foxes. Injuries as a result of active digging along the wired perimeter fencing were common. Because of the lack of information on litter sizes in wild populations, it is difficult to make comparisons between captive-bred and wild-born litters.\n\nWild animals being brought into an existing colony should be examined, immunized, and quarantined for a minimum of sixty days. (Source: Captive breeding of the Swift Fox at the Cochrane Ecological Institute, Alberta, by Clio Smeton, et al.)\n\nThis is a peer-reviewed volume of twenty-four papers of swift fox ecology and status in North America by experts in the state-of-the-science. The topics are: conservation, distribution, habitat loss, taxonomy, and physiology. The intended readers are scientists, resource managers, and students.\n\nThe germ of the project was a 1998 International Symposium on Swift Foxes, held in Saskatoon, with papers from biologists and endangered species experts from fifteen states, three provinces, and seven countries. This is a collation of papers presented, as well as additional research since then. The five major sections are: Part I Setting the Stage; Part II Distribution and Population Shifts; Part III Censusing and Techniques; Part IV Population Ecology; and Part V Taxonomy/Physiology/Disease.\n\nIn summary, the papers consider swift fox issues in general; explore the current distribution of North American species; evaluate scent stations for surveys; along with a review on mitigating capture-related injuries. The reader will understand the dynamics of changes, related to loss of suitable habitats, due to human activities and climate change.\n\nAccording to Axel Moehrenschlager, et. al., the trapping of wild mammals can lead to decreases in fitness by causing stress, physical injury, immunosuppression, or a change in scent that may subsequently affect survival. (p. 107) In North America, box and leg-hold trapping and darting from helicopters has occasionally resulted in overstress, injury, or death of coyotes, red foxes, and wolves. Radio collars have been found to affect their body weight and survival, in the first 30 days after collaring, together with neck abrasions, a paw trapped, loose collar or when a young animal outgrows it.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of Natural Neighbours: Selected Mammals of Saskatchewan, (Regina, SK: Canadian Plains Research Centre, 2001) 206 pp. paper $19.95\n\nAccording to this competent and attractive resource, there are over 4,600 species of mammals on earth, including Homo sapiens. There are 78 species of wild mammals in the Province. The vertebrate class is Mammalia. There are suggestions for further reading. The present text contains both black-and-white and full colour photographs. There are also line drawings by a local artist-illustrator for this collective project.\n\nThis publication was a joint project with Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management. The book contains a selection of mammals, some of which are widely distributed and others are fairly unique and/or endangered. There are species accounts of insect-eaters, rabbits and hares, gnawing mammals, flesh-eaters, and even-toed hoofed animals. It describes their appearance, habits, food, habitat, survival strategies, ecological relationships, status and range.\n\nThere are four Appendices: 1 is a Listing all the Saskatchewan Mammals, 2: Mammal Specific Viewing Site Information, 3: An Ecological Perspective on processes and the Ecological Land Classification System of Canada and Saskatchewan, and 4: more detailed information on the characteristics, in an Overview of the Ecozones/Ecoregions in Saskatchewan.\n\nThis is a title in the several planned for Discover Saskatchewan sub-series on the flora and fauna of the Province. The present text is an update of the Resource Reader, first published in the late 1960s as a school textbook. Future books will describe interconnected animal and plant life. The next title will contain selected birds and further books may focus on reptiles, amphibians, trees, shrubs, native plants, fish and insects.\n\nFor further research, The Ecoregions of Saskatchewan, a technical document, reveals that the Prairie Ecozone extends into Manitoba and Alberta. You may also consult A National Ecological Framework for Canada, 1996, and Ecological Regions of North America, 1997.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of 620 Wild Plants of North America, Fully Illustrated, by Tom Reaume (Regina, SK: Canadian Plains Research Centre, 2009) 784 pp. cloth $80.\n\nThe author teaches plant taxonomy at Luther College at the University of Regina. He was not trained in botany or as an illustrator, but his interest in plants and drawing skills are advanced. He suggests that Universities make it mandatory for each student working on an advanced degree in the natural sciences to visit the herbarium and maintain dot maps for 30 species during their years of research. \"That way, someone with an interest in birds, beetles, or bats might actually get to know a few plants by the time they finish their academic training.\" (p. 22)\n\n\"It is, perchance,\n\nthat sweet scent of the earth\n\nof which the ancients speak.\"\n\n—Henry David Thoreau\n\nThis is a prodigious resource with 89 Families and 620 Species, accompanied by illustrative pen-and-ink, black-and white-line drawings, in alphabetical arrangement. Each of the plant species has a letter-size page with readable print, a map of its range and large, labelled drawings in ink.\n\nAccording to the author the internet was a valuable resource (cited H.D. Wilson, 2001). Some maps online are based on published books. As the Flora of North America volumes are published (two per year) their maps become available online at www.fna.org. The author admits it was impossible to recheck the original identifications or to make adjustments for some taxonomic changes.\n\nThis sumptuously produced reference work contains a Foreword, by the Academic Dean and Professor of Biology, Luther College at the University of Regina, who espouses \"the beauty of the drawings, the beauty of the plants shown, the beauty of the poetry and ecological insights, and the beauty of this part of the world\". (p. 8)\n\nIn the Preface, Reaume opines, \"From a naturalist's perceptive, all plants are native to this planet and were drawn with little thought to their place among undulating human attitudes.\" (p. 9). Among his acknowledgements are: Nature Manitoba (formerly Manitoba Naturalists Society), University of Winnipeg, and University of Manitoba, the Living Prairie Museum in Winnipeg, and others.\n\nIn his Introduction, he observes, \"At the fundamental level nature, for whatever reasons, prefers beauty.\" (cited David Gross, p. 13) This section outlines Field play; Arrangement of Species; Names, Illustrations, Species Descriptive Text; Measurements, Native Plant Restoration, and Maps of Plant Ranges.\n\nIn addition, there are: a glossary, references, and maps, the area covered for the range of each species, general location of mountains and four vegetative types presented with five patterns or ecozones of Boreal Forest, Tundra, Mountains, Prairie or Great Plains, and Deciduous Forest.\n\nThis is an essential tool for scientists and would-be scientists to learn about the taxonomy of plants, amid the wealth of the natural world, depicted and respected for its endless variety.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of Wolves in Canada, by Erin McCloskey (Edmonton: Lone Pine Publishing 2011) paper 208 pp. $18.95; Mammals of Canada, by Tamara Eder and Gregory Kennedy (Edmonton: Lone Pine Publishing, 2011) cloth, 448 pp. $39.95.\n\nMcCloskey has edited and written several nature guides for Lone Pine Publishing, including her recent Bear Attacks books. She has a Bachelor in Science, with a major in conservation biology and management from the University of Alberta. She surveys current wolf management across Canada: culling, hunting and trapping; aerial shooting, poisoning, and sterilization. There are some other strategies which involve non-lethal measures, as well as mitigation of human impact on wildlife. She observes that the wolf is now primarily a Canadian species, although there has been some reintroduction to the United States. In general, wolves will avoid urban areas, while coyotes can become habituated to garbage. The animal story is a Canadian genre. The word bounty has been replaced by incentive and compensation. This book contains maps, black-and-white photographs, and References.\n\nTamara Eder has a degree in environmental conservation sciences. Gregory Kennedy is a naturalist and historian, producer of film and television programs. Their book, with a Quick Reference Guide, contains full-colour photographs and illustrations; maps, a glossary, selected references, and an index. We find: hoofed animals; whales, dolphins, & porpoises; carnivores, rodents, hares & pikas; the mole family of insectivores & opossums; with keys to bats and shrews. Among the carnivores, in the dog family, are: coyotes, grey wolf, arctic fox; swift fox, red fox, and grey fox. Although rabbits and hares belong to the same family, you will learn their distinct differences.\n\nOnly nine humans have been killed by wolves in North America in the past 110 years. As the number of moose, elk, deer, and other prey species grow, so do the number of wolves. (Source: Controlling the wolf population won't save caribou, biologists say, by Ed Struzik, Edmonton Journal, Monday, June 13, 2011, B3.)\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of The World of Wolves: New Perspectives on Ecology, Behaviour and Management, edited by Marco Musiani, Luigi Boitani, and Paul Paquet (University of Calgary Press, 2010) 352 pp. Indexed. paper $34.95\n\nWith an informative introduction on The Key Role Played by Wolves in Community Ecology and Wildlife Management Planning, this collection of nine essays has been divided into two Sections. Section I Re-discovering the Role of Wolves in Natural and Semi-natural Ecosystems deals, in part, with the population genetics of wolf-like canids, establishing What, if anything, is a wolf? The articles examine the recovering of wolves in Banff and Yellowstone National Parks, as well as comparing the future of wolves and moose.\n\nThe Section II Wolves Role in Wildlife Management Planning includes a study of Human Impacts in Protected Wolf Populations, Hunting and Removal of Wolves. The articles analyze anthropogenically-modified snow conditions on wolf predatory behaviour; re-colonizing the wolf population in two Scandinavian countries; as well as wolf management in Eastern Europe, in comparison with North America. In addition, a snowmobile wolf hunt in the North West Territories is described, with reducing wolf depredation risk in Alberta.\n\nIn Alberta, wolves are relatively abundant in northern and central Alberta; wolves in southern Alberta are restricted to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains along the southwest forest and agricultural fringe. The authors observe that non-lethal means, such as relocation, to protect livestock may be essential to maintain a viable wolf population in southern Alberta. (p. 262)\n\nGrizzly bears are hit and killed by trains in Banff National Park. Biologists and ecologists study bear-and-wolf behaviours, with radio-or-satellite-collars. To capture wolves, nets are cast from a helicopter and the wolves anaesthetized. Wolves use roads for easier transportation because they are free of obstacles and thick vegetation. In Canada, wolf hunting and trapping are both allowed. Ranchers can kill wolves that are considered a threat to their livestock year-round. Governments may kill wolves to protect prey populations.\n\nComplementing the text are 38 colour photographs, grouped at the back of the book, 44 black-and-white figures, and 9 pencil drawings. There is a profusion of tables and figures, with a bibliography of Literature Cited (pp. 287-352).\n\nThis is number 3 in the Energy, Ecology, And The Environment Series, preceded by Place: Linking Nature, Culture, and Planning, by J. Gordon Nelson and Patrick L. Lawrence, Number 1, and A New Era for Wolves and People: Wolf Recovery, Human Attitudes, and Policy, edited by Marco Musiani, Luigi Boitani, and Paul Paquet, Number 2.\n\nBoth Musiani and Paquet teach at the University of Calgary. Paquet was the founder and director of the Central Rockies Wolf Project in Canmore, Alberta.\n\nThe List of Tables and Figures, with Biographies for the Editors, Contact Authors and Artists, should have been placed near the end of the book.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of Birds of a Feather: Tales of a Wild Bird Haven, by Linda Johns (Fredericton, N.B.: Goose Lane Editions, 2005) 263 pp. paper\n\nThis joy-filled narrative is a recent contribution to the grand tradition of the animal story, practiced by Edward William Thomson (1849-1924), author of Old Man Savarin Stories; and Americans Ernest Thompson Seton and Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nSome of these were fictionalized accounts of animal-human interactions, based in first-hand experience. More recently, a journalist's 2005 bestseller about a family dog, (after a move from Michigan to Florida) as the memoir by John Grogan, Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog became a movie. The title was abbreviated from the adage Birds of a Feather, Flock Together written by and for a naturalist; of interest to birders, child and child-like readers.\n\nThis title, which incorporates some of her fan mail from readers, contains black-and-white illustrations by the author, who is also an artist, sculptor, and poet. The chronology cycles through spring and summer, ending with winter solstice. Johns lives and paints in rural Nova Scotia. She manifests maternal pride in her adopted babies, youngsters, and adolescents, who seem like new kids in a schoolyard (p. 228)\n\nGannets are among her avian convalescents, while starlings and deer make their appearances in this back-garden-centric setting. Her attempts at gardening are sometimes foiled by raccoons, snakes, mice, and squirrels, much as prey animals are sanctioned by predators. A queue of cow, sandpipers, cats, and starlings accompany her efforts and, with varying results, to release some of them into the wild.\n\nMore often, rehabilitated grosbeak, raven, ladyhawk, falcons, and woodpeckers must be fed, on occasion by bug and worm hunting, in order to provide for their growing menage of animals. Naming plays a significant role in habituated pets, such as the goats, Mower and Munch, her robins and turkeys, her husband Mack, Kiwi male and Starr a female, Beejay and Pip bluejays, to promote her anthropomorphic point of view.\n\nRehabilitation of injured wildlife may prepare them only to become part of a domestic household as family members. Johns named her rabbit Edna, after Edna Staebler, a dear friend and long-time writer of cookbooks. Blossom, a chicken, leads a variety of pigeons, warbler, ducks, Whiskey a grey jay, and assorted woodcocks.\n\nI concur with a reader, that: \"I now see animals and other living creatures with an entire[ly] new perspective. I always knew they can show emotion as well as deep feeling, but it is the birds that surprised me most of all.\" (p. 61)\n\nJohns is the author of Sharing a Robin's Life (1994) which won the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction, the only such award in Canada, endowed by Staebler (1906-2006) and administered by Wilfred Laurier University). Other popular titles are: In the Company of Birds; For the Birds; A Feathered Family; and Wild and Woolly.\n\nAnne Burke\n\nReview of Best Groundcovers & Vines for the Prairies, by Hugh Skinner & Sara Williams (Markham, Ontario: Fitzhenry & Whiteside Ltd, 2008) 234 pp. paper $24.99 Indexed."
