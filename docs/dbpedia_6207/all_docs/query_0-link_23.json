        "text": "Last spring the bugs feasted on Milo the poor AwesomeDog and me, and it was miserable. I tried all the things: a smoky fire (I suffered respiratory distress before the bugs did), citronella candles (no effect), essential oil repellants for both Milo and me (not strong enough), dousing myself in enough Deet to melt every piece of plastic I touched (gross). The only moderately effective and not disgusting tactic was fire up a powerful fan.\n\nI promised myself that this year would be different. I did some research and bought myself a Clam Quick-Set Screen Tent for my birthday.\n\nOMG! It is fabulous. Thank you, Self, for getting me such a great present!\n\nIt is 11 feet across and more than 7 feet tall in the centre. I set it up, by myself, in less than a minute. Seriously, less than a minute. And, it doesn’t take any longer to take it down and stow it away.\n\nSome of the reviews complain that it’s tricky to take down. It isn’t—read the instructions. If reading instructions is not your thing, there’s a bunch of instructional YouTube video’s waiting to be watched.\n\nThis tent’s big enough for a picnic table, but I outfitted it with a comfy chair, a dog bed, an inflatable air mattress, and a cooler. I sit in there in the evenings sipping a beer while Milo chews a bone, and occasionally in the afternoons, I bring out a magazine and nap on the air mattress. Heaven.\n\nDon’t be stingy, buy the optional wind panels too. Because this tent pops open, the sides protrude beyond the roof. If it rains, some rain will come in through the mesh. The side panels attach with Velcro—super easy—and will deter the rain.\n\nI don’t usually do product endorsements, but this screen tent is worth every penny.\n\nHappy camping!\n\nMilo the AwesomeDog and I enjoyed some pleasant hiking at Inverhuron Provincial Park last week.\n\nChain Trail:\n\nWe stayed at the Holmes Bay Campground and it took us about 25 minutes to walk along Chain Trail to the Dog Exercise Area. Once there, Milo enjoyed a swim in Lake Huron, and we turned around and walked home.\n\nThe trail is flat, well-maintained, and dry, all of which makes for an easy stroll. Our walk snaked between the lake shore and the campgrounds, offering both shade and lake views. Those views tempted Milo the AwesomeDog to give a few mighty yanks on his leash. I tried explaining to him that we were in fact on our way to a spot where he could swim, but delaying gratification has never been his strong suit.\n\nEncountering an emergency alert siren for the Bruce Nuclear Power Station, which is less than three miles away, freaked me out. I’m glad there is an alert system, but the juxtaposition of the siren tower with the sound of the waves and the wind in the cedars was disconcerting.\n\nRiver Trail:\n\nRiver Trail is a sort of bait and switch. The pamphlet describes it as moderate to difficult with large hills and rough surfaces. But, it starts out as a wide gravel path leading over an arched bridge of worn wood that would be right at home in The Shire. Up until that point, a person could manage in flip flops. But, believe the pamphlet and wear good shoes. Some of the hills were very steep and ran alongside the eroding riverbank—not a great place for kids or strollers. It was useful to have Milo on a harness for part of that hike. He knows that “hup, hup” means lean into the harness, and I appreciated the help on some of those uphill scrambles. Also, this poops him out, which is good for both of us when we get home for our afternoon nap.\n\nPay attention during your hike because some of the trail markers are faded and difficult to spot.\n\nRiver Trail skirts along the riverbank and winds through groves of cedar trees. Milo and I finished this pretty loop in about an hour.\n\nBeach\n\nBoardwalks arc across the ecologically delicate sand dunes that separate the sandy beach from the parking lot, protecting the dunes from foot traffic erosion. Milo and I only got as far as those boardwalks because dogs aren’t allowed on people beaches in Ontario – I suspect this has something to do with not wanting kids making castles with urine-soaked sand. Whatever the reason, Milo and I didn’t actually go to the beach. I only mention it here to let you know that even though the water level in Lake Huron is high this year, there is still a good-sized strip of soft-looking sand along the water’s edge.\n\nIf you would like to know about Holmes Bay campground at Inverhuron click here.\n\nMilo the AwesomeDog and I spent last week at Inverhuron Provincial Park in our 18-foot travel trailer. I give the place two thumbs up.\n\nCampsite 247 is excellent—level, covered in gravel with good drainage, ringed with sweet smelling and privacy providing cedar trees. It is a pull-through site with long driveways at each end, which provided a buffer to the road and other campers. The lakeshore is a two-minute walk away, as is Chain Trail, a well-maintained path that skirts along the Lake Huron shore and provides a scenic a 25-minute walk to the dog exercise area.\n\nThe park website noted that campers might need an extension cord to reach the electrical outlets. I always bring one and so was a bit smug about what I thought was advice for newbies. But, I had to sign out a third cord from the park office. Be warned, they require a $150 deposit. The deposit makes sense because I could easily imagine driving off with that cord without thinking about it and $150 was enough to remind me to give the darn thing back.\n\nAll of this wonderfulness is somewhat tempered by the intermit low-level hum of the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. A few years ago, the sound would have bugged me. But, the park was so pretty that it put me right in my happy place and I just thought, “Oh well, it’s making electricity. I’m using electricity. Fair enough.”\n\nBe warned, if you camp here, be sure to check out the pictures and the privacy ratings of your site on the Ontario Parks Online Reservation System when you book your trip. A woman staying at an interior, non-reservable site told me that her place was surrounded by unsightly felled trees. Ick.\n\nMilo and my trip to Inverhuron benefited from some good luck: the wood was dry, the other campers were quiet and friendly, and the sunsets were stunning. We’ll be back.\n\nNote to self: next time try to get site 261. Even though it is a back-in site, because of the layout backing up will not be complicated and it is gorgeous.\n\nMilo the AwesomeDog and I spend lots of time RV camping. When we started traveling together I packed waaaaay too much stuff for him, which made getting ready to go camping a big ordeal. I’ve since streamlined the packing process. Now, I only bring what he needs and it just takes a couple of minutes to throw his stuff in the camper.\n\nHere’s my RV camping packing list for Milo:\n\nObvious things\n\nFood\n\nPoop bags\n\nFood and water bowls\n\nComfortable housing\n\nI keep him with me almost all the time. When I’m sitting at a picnic table or relaxing in front of a campfire Milo rests in an exercise pen. I can attach a tarp to one side of the pen in case I need to shield him from unruly kids or dogs, and I have a fabulous reflective sunshade that keeps him cool on hot days. I’ve recently started bringing an electric fan that I set just outside his pen. It does a great job of keeping the mosquitos away.\n\nx-pen\n\nsunshade\n\ntarp\n\nstrong fan to keep the bugs off\n\nHiking, swimming, and kayaking stuff\n\nI take him kayaking with me, and so he needs a lifejacket. And he carries his own snacks and water on long hikes, so he needs his backpack too. Sometimes I run his short leash through my belt and sometimes I hold it, but I find that all we need is one 6-foot leash.\n\n6-foot leash\n\nhis backpack\n\nhis life jacket\n\nSafety\n\nI always keep a copy of his papers in my vehicle, and when we’re camping I write my cell phone number on his collar with a Sharpie in case he loses his tags. I also bring a flyer with his picture and my phone number on it (just in case). Finally, I keep a canine first aid kit in the trailer, which I supplement with Benadryl, because Milo occasionally eats bees, and a tick remover.\n\nPapers and tags\n\nProof of vaccinations\n\nLost dog flyer (just in case)\n\nFirst aid kit\n\nBenadryl\n\nTick Twister\n\nFun\n\nIn addition to his toys, I bring cans of wet dog food and a couple of Kong chew toys. I have a freezer in my trailer, and I make him frozen Kongs so he has something to do on rainy days.\n\nTug toy\n\nWater retrieve toy\n\nLand retrieve toy\n\nKongs\n\nCans of wet dog food for easy frozen Kong filling\n\nDe-skunking potion ingredients\n\nI always keep the ingredients for a de-skunking wash in my trailer. I’ve never had to use them, but I have a friend who had to make a long drive home with a very skunky dog, and I never want to be in that position.\n\nhydrogen peroxide\n\nbaking soda\n\ndish soap\n\ndisposable tarp\n\nI bring fewer things for Milo than I used to, and we still have a great time.\n\nHere’s Milo at campsite 220 at Grundy Lake Provincial Park. He’s in his 48-inch Precision X-pen. This pen is a bit pricey, but it’s worth it. It’s a safer and more comfortable option than a tie-out. The black wire blends into the background and the pen has a walk-through door that is easy for people and not just dogs to use. It is simple to set up and is sturdy.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAs a philosophy professor (my day job) I spend a lot of time thinking about the hidden curriculum. The hidden curriculum includes things that get taught and learned, without anyone intending to teach or learn them.\n\nFor example, if I asked you to name a bunch of philosophers, you might mention Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, or Locke. It just so happens that all of these philosophers are white guys.\n\nSadly, it is not hard to find philosophy classes that only cover things that white guys wrote. In these classes, the explicit curriculum, which the professor intends to teach, concerns the ideas of great philosophers like Aristotle and the other guys on the list.\n\nBut we need to be careful about what the hidden curriculum is saying. It would be a shame if the students ended up learning that philosophers are white guys (which might be happening since white guys comprise the vast majority of philosophy majors). No one intends to teach this, but most teaching and learning is not intentional.\n\nWhy am I talking about the hidden curriculum on a “Training Tuesday” post while Milo and I are on vacation?\n\nBecause there is lots of overlap between teaching people and training dogs. I kid you not, working with Milo has made me a much better professor. In this case, though, it is the other way around, thinking about teaching humans and the hidden curriculum is making me a better dog guardian.\n\nDogs and people are learning all the time. Just because a student doesn’t sit down to learn that philosophers are white guys in the same way that they sit down to learn that Aristotle lived between 384-322 BCE, doesn’t mean that they don’t pick up both messages. They don’t stop encoding memories at the end of each lecture.\n\nImagine using punitive methods to train a dog to sit. The explicit curriculum is about teaching the dog to sit when it’s told to do so. The hidden curriculum teaches the dog that mistakes are dangerous, that the handler is not a friend, and that the world is scary and capricious.\n\nOn the other hand, training the same behavior using positive methods, exemplifies a very different hidden curriculum. Dogs trained in this way learn that it is good to try new things and that working with their handler is not only safe but is more like play than like work.\n\nJust because Milo and I are on vacation (and I forgot a bunch of our training equipment at home), it doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to learn anything on this trip. In other words, there is a hidden curriculum embedded in our relationship and Milo is learning that curriculum even when we are not formally training.\n\nThere are some things I do not want him to learn on this trip. For example, I don’t want him to learn to ignore my recall when we are on the shore of a beautiful big lake, and I don’t want him to learn to grab a hotdog when I am toasting it over the fire (you know how this one got on the list…).\n\nThere are also lots of things I do want him to learn, even though they are not in any training plan. I want him to learn that he and I can have delightful adventures together, that there are lots of happy, friendly people in the world, and that no matter what we’re doing or where we are, I’ve got his back.\n\nMilo doesn’t stop learning just because I stop training.\n\nMilo has already learned that Lake Huron has an abundance of excellent sticks.\n\nI spent last summer camping with an 18-foot trailer and a 90-pound German Shepherd Dog named Milo. Looking out at the mounds of snow in my backyard, I’m longing for some summer camping. And since you can reserve campsites in Ontario Provincial Parks five months in advance, it is time to start booking sites. I want to return to the best Ontario provincial parks for camping that I visited last summer.\n\nAs I was scrolling through last summer’s blog posts, I realized that I was happy in every single place, even the ones that were less than perfect. I’m mostly just happy to be camping. But some places were nicer than others and so here are my reviews of the Ontario provincial park campgrounds that I stayed in last summer:\n\nAaron Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nBalsam Lake Provincial Park: A good place for human contact (no ghosts)\n\nLots of sites (not all of them but lots of them) at Balsam Lake are just parking places in a big field. If you want to stay here, book early and look closely at the pictures of your potential campsite to make sure it is a place you really want to be.\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park: Needs hobbits\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park: Quick notes on the campground\n\nGrundy Lake Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nI was leery when I arrived because my site was in a campground called “Trailer,” but it was gorgeous, so don’t be put off by the name.\n\nSwan Lake Trail (at Grundy)\n\nKakabeka Falls Provincial Park: Great for people, stinky for dogs\n\nKillbear Provincial Park\n\nLookout Point Trail at Killbear Provincial Park\n\nThe off-leash dog beach is fabulous at Killbear\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park: Beautiful sunsets over Lake Huron\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park: Yurts and how to say “Hi” to Milo\n\nMississagi Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada: Here be dragons\n\nWhen I was at Mississagi, it was wild and empty. 😀\n\nThe Beach at Pancake Bay Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nPancake Bay has a super dog beach.\n\nRainbow Falls Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nWhite Lake Provincial Park, Ontario: Home away from home\n\nHappy Camping Friends!\n\nWhen it comes to RV traveling and full-time RV living, space and weight are limited. Anyone who spends a lot of time in an RV already has everything they need, and probably can’t carry much more than they already have. So, how on earth do you choose a gift for them? I surveyed friends and Facebook and came up with lots of ideas:\n\nGift cards. A gift card can be a very thoughtful present for some who travels a lot. My Mom sent me a Tim Hortons card, and I thought of her fondly every morning as I sipped my coffee. Here are some gift card ideas:\n\nAmazon\n\nCanadian Tire\n\nGas Cards\n\nStarbucks\n\nTim Hortons\n\nRestaurant chains\n\nMountain Equipment Co-op\n\nGift certificates. If you want to make someone happy, buy them a massage after a long drive. Yum.\n\nSpa day\n\nPedicure\n\nCamping stores\n\nConsumables. The goodness of most of these things is obvious. But an RV traveler might be the only person who would actually appreciate charcoal for Christmas.\n\nChocolates/cookies/candy\n\nCoffee/tea/hot chocolate\n\nCheeses/jerky/salty snacks\n\nWine\n\nS’more fixings\n\nHome baked goods\n\nFlowers\n\nSunscreen/bug spray\n\nMatches/lighters/candles\n\nCharcoal/wood/fire starters\n\nCozy, comfy things. Things to fight off the early morning chill are always nice.\n\nElectric blanket\n\nEssential oil dispenser and some essential oils\n\nSparkly things to hang in the windows\n\nNice throw\n\nFleece pj’s\n\nHoodie\n\nGood socks\n\nFuzzy footed onesie\n\nWoolen hat and mittens\n\nUseful things. Utilitarian presents are only good if the recipient actually needs them, so you have to do your homework. If they have everything they need, remember that a nicer or newer or upgraded version of something they already have can also be a great gift. Pay attention to what they complain about—it will give you an idea of what needs upgrading.\n\nSolar powered flashlight\n\nSolar powered lamp\n\nSolar powered USB charger\n\nHeavy-duty flashlight\n\nHeadlamp\n\nCooler\n\nCompass\n\nHeavy leather woman-sized work gloves\n\nInsulated water jug with a spigot\n\nGood doormat\n\nBoot scraper for outside the door\n\nPricier items. Notice that these items are small and useful.\n\nKindle\n\nTablet\n\nCamera\n\nBinoculars\n\nWhat items would you add to this gift list?\n\nThis blog is about RV travel, dogs, and science. Stay tuned for the dog and science-themed gift lists. 😉\n\nAt 22 I was finishing up my undergraduate degree and itching to see the world. I needed to get off the Canadian Prairies, away from Saskatoon where I was going to school, and escape any and all things related to farming. So, I bought a good pair of shoes, a backpack, and a plane ticket and was off to eat my way across Europe.\n\nI devoured curry and toured the Tower of London, nibbled Pain au Chocolat after climbing the Eiffel Tower, picnicked with a grey-eyed man on the Piazza San Marco and then we strolled arm in arm along Venice’s canals. I gorged on goulash and spaetzle before retiring to Budapest’s Roman Baths, snacked on Sachertorte after seeing The Magic Flute at the Vienna Volksoper, and drank beer under Munich’s Glockenspiel. And, I wallowed in homesickness as powerful as it was unexpected. I would never have predicted that the best part of that trip would be returning home.\n\nJohannes Hofer combined the Greek words for homeward journey, ‘nostos,’ and ache, ‘algos,’ to give us ‘nostalgia,’ which originally meant, quite literally, ‘homesickness.’ He coined the term to describe an illness rampant among Swiss mercenary soldiers in France who were incapacitated by a melancholic yearning for their mountain homes.\n\nMy travels always ended with nostalgia, until now.\n\nIf it weren’t for the brutal facts that winter is coming, and that I need to, eventually, show up at work to get money for gas, beer, groceries, and campground fees, I would have happily kept on trucking. Not for a single second did I ache for home.\n\nMilo and I in our travel trailer—like turtles, our home was always with us. And I realized that, for me, home is where the puppy is.\n\nI understand the urge to squeeze every possible moment out of a weekend camping. Lots of families roll into a campground on Friday night and check out at the last possible minute on Sunday.\n\nThat’s a lot of people leaving at the same time. The last stop for most RVers before heading home is the park dump station, which means that around checkout time on Sunday there is always, always, a line. If there are ten RV’s in front of you, you’ll be hanging out, at the sewer, for an hour waiting your turn.\n\nThere’s a difference between knowing something and really knowing something. You really know about the campground sewer bottleneck once you’ve been stuck in it. The last time I was in a bathroom line this long was when I went to see The Who.\n\nYou can’t see the whole line because it is curved, it is longer than it looks here, my truck is the blue one pulling the Sportsmen.\n\nFor me it wasn’t actually that bad –I just gave Milo a chew toy, pulled out a book, and put on some music. There weren’t any fires I needed to put out.\n\nBut, some of those vehicles were full of tired families. That had to be a long, long wait for those parents of colicky babies and sunburned kids who wouldn’t stay on their side of the bench seat and whose bladders were filling up as the minutes ticked by.\n\nSo, here’s a piece of advice. If check out time is 11 AM, don’t show up at the dump station between 10 and noon on a Sunday. While you have to be out of your campsite by 11, you can stay in the park all day. Why not leave the site and have a picnic lunch before hitting the dump station?\n\nI don’t really care about the line, this is just some friendly advice for families. I could see the will to live gradually seep out of parents as they waited to deal with their kids’ sewage, for the second time, and that is no way to end a camping trip."
