        "text": "Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness\n\nSuperior National Forest\n\nClick \"Show\" to read the latest BWCAW Alerts banner!\n\nA Place Worth Preserving\n\nThe BWCA Wilderness is a unique area located in the northern third of the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota. Over 1,098,000 acres in size, it extends nearly 150 miles along the International Boundary adjacent to Canadaâs Quetico and La Verendrye Provincial Parks, bordered on the west by Voyageurs National Park with Grand Portage Monument to the east. The BWCAW contains over 1,200 miles of canoe routes, 12 hiking trails and over 2,000 designated campsites.Â\n\nThis area was set aside in 1926 to preserve its primitive character and made a part of the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1964 with subsequent legislation in 1978. Wilderness offers freedom to those who wish to pursue an experience of expansive solitude, challenge and personal connection with nature. The BWCAW allows visitors to canoe, portage and camp in the spirit of those travelers that came before them centuries ago.Â\n\nThe BWCAW Act of 1978\n\nIn 2018, we observed the 40th anniversary of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act (PL 95-495). The 1964 Wilderness Act created the National Wilderness Preservation System that included the BWCA. The BWCAW Act of 1978 added more acreage and specific management direction with the purpose to protect, manage, enhance and restore the area. Learn more about the BWCAW Act of 1978\n\nPlan Ahead and Prepare\n\nFor the most current, comprehensive information on planning a trip to the BWCAW, please review the BWCAW Trip Planning Guide from the U.S. Forest Service to help you plan a safe and successful trip, and learn more about the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area.Â\n\nNotifications and Alerts\n\nReminders about BWCAW rules and best practices:\n\nOne permit per day, per permit holder: When a permit holder makes multiple reservations on the same entry date or has overlapping reservations, all but one permit will be cancelled by the Forest Service without notification.

Check the box under a group memberâs name to select an alternate who can pick up the permit if the group leader canât go.\n\nIssue Stations: Pick an issue station near your entry point prior to making a reservation. Check the âIssue Stationsâ tab for hours and locations.Â\n\nNon-profits: Click for information about reserving BWCAW permits for a non-profit organizationÂ\n\nPlan Ahead and Prepare: All permit holders are required to watch three Leave No Trace education videos and review the BWCAW Regulations and Rules prior to receiving their permit:Â\n\nWatch parts 1 & 2 of the BWCAW Leave No Trace video series prior to departing. To receive credit, click the links in the emails sent to the permit holder to access the videos (use Chrome to avoid errors). If you have not viewed parts 1 and 2 of the video series before arriving at your issue station, you will need to watch the complete BWCAW Leave No Trace video series before receiving your permit.Â\n\nThoroughly review the BWCAW Trip Planning Guide.
