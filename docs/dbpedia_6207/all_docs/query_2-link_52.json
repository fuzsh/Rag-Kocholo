The 390-million-year-old fossil beds are among the largest exposed Devonian fossil beds in the world. The park features a spectacular interpretive center overlooking the fossil beds featuring new interactive, immersive exhibits.\n\nWhile fossil collecting is prohibited on the fossil beds and river bank, the park staff encourages visitors to explore and discover the many different types of fossils that can be found on the ancient sea bottom. Collecting piles (with rock and fossils from quarries) are the only place where rocks may be removed at the Falls of the Ohio. They are located by the parking lot behind the interpretive center.\n\nAugust through October provides the best accessibility to the 220 acres of fossil beds, as the river is at its lowest level during this period.\n\nStay connected\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFalls of the Ohio Foundation\n\nThis property is a stop on the\n\nLearn more at www.indianabirdingtrail.com.\n\nFalls Facts\n\nMore than 600 species of fossils have been described at the Falls, two-thirds of which have been “type specimens,” which are fossils described for the first time. More than 250 species of corals have been identified.\n\nIn 1778, George Rogers Clark established the first permanent English-speaking settlement in the Northwest Territory on Corn Island. Later he lived on the shore and founded Clarksville. His homesite, below the Falls, is now part of the state park, though his cabin no longer exists.\n\nIn 1806 Aaron Burr trained troops in Jeffersonville and built ships at Silver Creek for a possible invasion of Mexico.\n\nWilliam Clark, younger brother of George Rogers Clark, set out from here with Meriwether Lewis to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase.\n\n“The rumbling sound of the waters as they tumble over the rock-paved rapids, is at all times soothing to the ear.” —John James Audubon. Audubon made more than 200 sketches of 14 species of birds while living in the Falls area.\n\nOver 270 species of birds have been recorded at the Falls.\n\nMark Twain and Walt Whitman both wrote about the Falls area.\n\nThe primitive paddlefish is but one of the 125 species of fish found at the Falls.\n\nHard limestone layers presented an obstacle to navigation for early explorers and settlers. This was the only place between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, (where the Ohio River starts) and New Orleans, Louisiana, where boats had dangerous rapids or a low water barricade of rock.\n\nActivities\n\nBoat Launch Ramp/Ohio River\n\nEducation Programs\n\nFishing\n\nHiking Trails\n\nInterpretive Naturalist Services\n\nInterpretive Center at Falls of the Ohio\n\nSpecial programs & events\n\nGeorge Rogers Clark cabin\n\nKids Indoor Activities\n\nPicnic areas\n\nBrochures\n\nBirds of Falls of the Ohio State Park checklist\n\nCorals of Falls of the Ohio State Park\n\nDiscovering Fossils\n\nInformation\n\nLocal map\n\nLocal tourism info\n\nRegional tourism info\n\nMore info: Falls of the Ohio\n\nDirections\n\nFalls of the Ohio State Park Events\n\nSun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat\n\nToday's Events\n\nView All Events\n\nLoading events"
