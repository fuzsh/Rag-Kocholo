Sharing camera monitoring techniques with partners\n\nTaking a liking to lichen: Indigenous partners supporting lichen collection\n\nUpdated Tonquin population estimate\n\nCougar specializing in caribou prey\n\nConservation breeding centre construction progress\n\nFollow caribou conservation in Jasper National Park! Join our mailing list to receive a newsletters each season.\n\nNew to the caribou recovery program? Learn more at parkscanada.ca/caribou-jasper\n\nCollaboration and engagement\n\nSay cheese! Sharing camera monitoring techniques with partners\n\nIndigenous partners from Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Mountain Cree spent two days in the field with the Caribou Recovery Team to learn how we set up and maintain remote wildlife cameras. We visited ten different cameras over the two days in Jasper.\n\nTaking a liking to lichen: Indigenous partners supporting lichen collection\n\nCaribou living in the Conservation Breeding Centre will require a lichen supply for their general nutrition, to help transition caribou to and away from pellet feed, and to passively move caribou within the breeding centre. While lichen is present in the breeding centre site, the caribou that first live there will quickly eat it and lichen is very slow to re-grow.\n\nIndigenous partners to Jasper National Park are working with Parks Canada to create lichen collection programs in their communities so that they can harvest lichen to feed caribou in the Conservation Breeding Centre. These programs can bring together members of the community of all ages, especially Elders and youth, to connect with the land and each other.\n\nIn early June, twelve Indigenous partners and biologist Carmen Richter of Saulteau First Nations joined Jasper National Park staff to discuss techniques for sustainably collecting lichen and to put those techniques into practice.\n\nLichen is a vital winter food source for caribou and takes many years to regenerate. For this reason, choosing where to collect lichen and picking sustainably is important to ensure lichens remain on the landscape.\n\n“It brings me great joy to see my kids and my wife out there, you know, working together, being proactive... It's like picking berries. It's soothing. It's comforting. It's relaxing… It's uplifting, really [that Indigenous knowledge is being prioritized within this project.] It's invigorating… It's traditional, inherent knowledge that existed in this element, in this realm, for a long time and that's why us as First Nations, we're created to bring balance to this natural environment…”\n\nFrank Roan, Mountain Cree\n\n“...[Parks Canada] is going to have a fairly large mama herd to maintain, when [they] finally get everything up and running. So if all the nations help out in their areas over the years to help sustain [the program], that would be wonderful. I've met so many other people from different nations around Alberta, B.C. and I'll get to see them next time around. And then you kind of form a bond with some of them because we're all working towards the same goal.”\n\nGloria Raicos, Lac Ste. Anne Métis\n\nResearch and monitoring\n\nUpdated Tonquin population estimate\n\nA minimum of 34 individual caribou were observed during the most recent visual survey in fall 2023. Further analyses using all available data to estimate the Tonquin population’s size, including scat DNA, indicate there are 45 caribou (95% credible interval of 42 to 47) with an estimated 10 reproductive females (95% credible interval of 7 to 13).\n\nThe Tonquin population is showing a declining trend for 2023 and 2024 after several years of a stable-to-increasing trend. Population growth is expected to be slower in the coming years due in part to a randomly high number of male calves born in 2022 and recent cougar predation leading to lower survival rates for adult females.\n\nBrazeau population estimate\n\nThe Brazeau population is too small to use statistical modelling. During aerial surveys in October 2023, only caribou tracks and scat were spotted near McGuire Lake.\n\nIn November 2023, one male and one female caribou near Poboktan Pass were observed from a helicopter. Though scat was collected at both locations, the samples came back as the same two individuals, a male and a female. Despite setting up two small-scale feeding sites with remote cameras, we did not observe caribou at either location this winter.\n\nCougar preying on Tonquin caribou\n\nFollowing the deaths of two collared caribou this spring (one pregnant female on April 27 and a male on May 3, 2024), Parks Canada has identified specialized hunting behaviour by a single cougar family in the Tonquin caribou range.\n\nThis cougar family has now been linked to the mortalities of four collared caribou in the Tonquin, using data from satellite collars, field investigations and DNA sampling. Investigations show that a female cougar with two kittens killed a caribou cow in August 2022. Her young male offspring then preyed on a caribou cow in September 2023 and the collared female and male this spring. (See our winter newsletter for more information about caribou mortality monitoring.)\n\nThese mortalities are unusual in Jasper. Only one caribou carcass of the 39 Parks Canada investigated between 2000 and 2022 is linked to cougar predation, and that one occurred at very low elevation.\n\nCougars are known to specialize in hunting one type of prey and passing their hunting knowledge to their offspring, which can put a small prey population like caribou at significant risk. Given the repeated predations in the Tonquin area, this young cougar likely learned from its mother to hunt caribou specifically.\n\nThe Tonquin herd cannot afford to lose more females – with fewer than 10 adult cows, losing one individual represents a 10 percent decrease in reproductive females. Every female caribou currently on the landscape is critical for recovering populations in Jasper National Park.\n\nTo protect the survival of the Tonquin caribou, a species at risk, Parks Canada is attempting to locate the male cougar involved in the most recent mortalities. Cougars are difficult to track, and their territories may span hundreds of square kilometres of wilderness, which makes finding a specific individual very challenging. Parks Canada continues to try to locate this individual cougar and adapt to changes in predation risk on caribou in Jasper National Park.\n\nConservation breeding centre\n\nConstruction progress\n\nMajor milestones have been accomplished at the Conservation Breeding Centre since the last newsletter in April. With warmer temperatures and the ground finally snow-free, work has resumed preparing the pens for their future caribou residents.\n\nFence posts for the breeding centre’s three-kilometre perimeter fence have been installed, along with a chain link “dig barrier.” This barrier prevents predators and other wildlife from getting in by digging underneath the perimeter fence. Once the dig barrier is installed, the contractor will then install wire mesh fencing on the posts.\n\nOver the summer, the contractor will install 16 kilometres of fencing for the 36 caribou pens inside the perimeter fence. Watering stations (“drinkers”) have been installed in each pen to provide the caribou with drinking water year-round.\n\nRoofing and siding have been installed on the three buildings.\n\nOver the summer, work will continue finishing the interiors and installing equipment. Other structures are also being built, including caribou feeding stations and shelters next to the handling barn and yearling pens (where caribou will enter for veterinary care and monitoring).\n\nTraffic control on Geraldine Road June 9 to October 1\n\nTo ensure the safety of visitors to Geraldine Lakes and Fryatt Valley, travel on Geraldine Road is allowed by vehicle only from June 9 to October 1, 2024.\n\nDuring working hours (typically 7 am to 7 pm), visitors must use the radio in the entry kiosk to request an escort for their vehicle through the first 1.44 km of Geraldine Road that is in the construction zone. During non-working hours, the road is open to all users. Use caution when traveling through the construction area.\n\nRead more\n\nCaribou Recovery Program Snapshot: Spring Newsletter 2024\n\nArchived Newsletters\n\nContact us\n\nDo you have a question or comment?

Learn more at parkscanada.ca/caribou-jasper\n\nCollaboration and engagement\n\nIn the lab: sharing monitoring technologies\n\nMembers of Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Mountain Cree joined the caribou recovery team for two days in December 2023 to talk about caribou and wildlife monitoring. They shared the monitoring and remote camera work they are using in their communities and learned more about Parks Canada’s remote camera monitoring.\n\nTogether we discussed approaches to placing cameras and sorting, tagging and analyzing the large quantity of images the cameras take each year. The partners spent time in the lab learning how Jasper National Park collects, stores and swabs caribou scat for DNA analysis. This two-way knowledge-sharing highlights the importance of a collaborative approach to caribou recovery in the region.\n\nSource population working group\n\nEstablishing a captive breeding population requires capturing wild (source) caribou and moving them to live in the Caribou Conservation Breeding Centre. Details on how many caribou will be captured, and from which populations, are not yet confirmed. Decisions will be based on the best available information about genetic and behavioural suitability, the impacts of removing animals from wild populations, and discussions with provincial, federal and Indigenous partners. It is imperative that source populations not be imperilled by moving females into the breeding program.\n\nParks Canada has formed a Source Population Working Group — together with Alberta’s Ministry of Environment and Protected Areas, British Columbia’s Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship and Environment and Climate Change Canada — to evaluate options for sourcing caribou for Parks Canada’s conservation breeding program.\n\nWith facilitation, technical expertise and the best available statistical tools and models from the not-for-profit Biodiversity Pathways, this working group is evaluating the potential impact on southern mountain caribou populations in Alberta and British Columbia if animals were moved to the conservation breeding program. When more technical information is available, we will continue discussions with Indigenous partners and the working group to request further guidance about capturing caribou from source populations.\n\nRecovery strategy amendment workshop\n\nMembers of the caribou recovery team attended Environment and Climate Change Canada’s workshops with Indigenous partners in Edmonton, Alberta and Prince George, British Columbia, to discuss proposed amendments to the Recovery Strategy for southern mountain caribou.\n\nThese workshops were an important opportunity to hear Indigenous partners’ perspectives on the proposed amendments, to hear from several Indigenous communities about the work they are doing in support of caribou recovery, and to share Parks Canada’s conservation breeding program.\n\nAlberta Chapter and Canadian Section of The Wildlife Society conference in Jasper\n\nThe Alberta Chapter and Canadian Section of The Wildlife Society held a Wildlife Research in Action Conference in Jasper in early March 2024.\n\nThe caribou monitoring team presented the conservation breeding program and deer monitoring project to 250 colleagues from universities, governments, consultancies and other environmental organizations. This conference was also a great opportunity to gain information on current research and techniques in ungulate and monitoring ecology.\n\nResearch and monitoring\n\nResearching caribou genetics and nutrition for conservation breeding\n\nJasper National Park is partnering with genetics researchers at the University of Calgary to better evaluate and track the genomics (fine-scale genetics) of southern mountain caribou in the region. This foundational work will ensure we have the best knowledge of wild caribou genetics to effectively manage caribou in the conservation breeding centre.\n\nParks Canada is also working with a researcher on a project to collate information on captive caribou diet and nutrition requirements. This report will be used to inform future animal care protocols in the conservation breeding centre.\n\nCaribou population monitoring\n\nFieldwork for the winter season is complete! The team completed aerial surveys in the Brazeau, Tonquin and À la Pêche caribou ranges to obtain a minimum count of animals and to collect scat for DNA analysis. Over 350 scat DNA samples have been swabbed and sent to a genetics laboratory to identify individual caribou. While we wait for those results, the team is working on a progress report for the years 2021 to 2023. Stay tuned!\n\nUpdate on small-scale feeding site in Brazeau caribou range\n\nFor many years, fewer than 10 caribou have been counted in the Brazeau caribou range. In an effort to improve our ability to locate caribou in the Brazeau population, the monitoring team and Frank Roan from Mountain Cree distributed pellet feed at two sites in high-altitude caribou habitat in November 2023.\n\nAfter three months, no caribou have been detected on the remote wildlife cameras at the feeding sites. This highlights the difficulty of monitoring a small population over a large area. Any feed left undiscovered will be removed before the end of winter.\n\nWolf population monitoring\n\nMonitoring predators in Jasper National Park, particularly wolves, is a critical component of caribou monitoring and management. Wolves are a keystone species with an important role in the natural environment. Scientists in Jasper use remote cameras and radio collars to understand how this important predator uses habitat in the national park. Wolf density near caribou habitat can significantly impact caribou population growth and is estimated yearly using images from over 110 remote cameras.\n\nOver the winter, the monitoring team reviewed images from July 2022 to July 2023 to calculate an estimated wolf density of 1.6 wolves in a 1000 km2 area, among approximately eight or nine main wolf packs.\n\nMany factors make tracking and capturing wolves challenging. In January and March of this year, specialists contracted by Parks Canada were able to add radio collars to wolves in three different packs using the Athabasca, Miette and Whirlpool river valleys.\n\nConservation breeding centre\n\nConstruction progress\n\nWork on the Caribou Conservation Breeding Centre has steadily progressed throughout the winter. The recent aerial image above helps illustrate the full footprint of the 65-hectare site and is very close to what the breeding centre will look like once complete. The wide clearing visible around the perimeter of the breeding centre is a 30-metre fireguard to mitigate the risk of wildfire.\n\nMechanical forestry work was completed in January 2024, with dead pine trees being split into campground firewood. Since then, crews have been cleaning up and burning the fine woody debris left behind.\n\nBurning debris piles has proven challenging this winter with the unusually low snowpack; snow is crucial to burning safely. This forestry work will mitigate the risk of wildfire affecting the breeding centre while retaining the younger forest regeneration layers within the caribou pens and reducing the risk of injury from deadfall.\n\nThe three buildings needed to operate the centre — the administration building, handling barn and storage shed — are taking shape!\n\nThe metal roofing and siding are almost complete, and on the inside, the walls are up with utilities and drywall installation progressing quickly.\n\nOnce the snow melts and the ground thaws, the contractor will begin installing watering stations in the caribou pens, installing many fences and gates, and preparing the alleyways and corral systems. ATCO will return to rehabilitate the ground disturbance where a buried high-voltage power line has been installed along Wabasso Road (93A) from the breeding centre towards Wabasso Campground.\n\nGeraldine Road is closed to traffic for the winter season\n\nPublic access on the first 1.44 km of Geraldine Road is restricted to ensure safety during construction. Geraldine Road will be accessible to vehicles beginning on June 9, 2024, using the same radio kiosk and escort system as last year. This ensures that visitors can safely move through the construction zone during working hours.\n\nTravel on Geraldine Road during construction of the Conservation Breeding Centre\n\nRead more\n\nCaribou Recovery Program Snapshot: Winter Newsletter 2023\n\nArchived Newsletters\n\nContact us\n\nDo you have a question or comment?

Caribou will require lichen as part of their diet in the future conservation breeding centre. While there is some lichen at the site, caribou will eat it quickly.\n\nA small group of Indigenous partners joined the caribou recovery team in November 2023 to discuss what a lichen collection program for Jasper might look like. Indigenous communities experienced in organizing lichen collection programs, like Aseniwuche Winewak Nation, will be key partners in the development of this program. We continue to work together, along with biologist Carmen Richter who specializes in sustainable lichen collection, towards the goal of having the first collection in spring 2024.\n\nSite visit with government partners\n\nIn October 2023, Parks Canada invited colleagues in conservation from the governments of Alberta and British Columbia and Environment and Climate Change Canada to visit the conservation breeding centre, currently under construction. The group discussed details of the program, including the design of the breeding centre, the science and monitoring aspects of the program, and ways to work together to support shared caribou recovery goals.\n\nCaribou Reproduction Workshop at Toronto Zoo\n\nJasper National Park caribou biologist Lalenia Neufeld attended the Toronto Zoo’s Caribou Reproduction Workshop from November 29 to December 1, 2023. The workshop was a great opportunity to present Parks Canada’s conservation breeding program and network with researchers, practitioners and Indigenous community members with common goals and an interest in caribou reproduction.\n\nResearch and monitoring\n\nMinimum population count of Tonquin and Brazeau caribou\n\nEach autumn, biologists survey caribou by flying over caribou habitat in a helicopter and counting the number of caribou they see. Despite delays due to low snow again this year, we conducted aerial surveys and collected caribou scat for DNA sampling at the end of October. Caribou and their tracks are easier to see when snow on the ground.\n\nThe monitoring team confirmed a minimum of 34 caribou in the Tonquin population as of October 2023.\n\nDuring the survey, the team observed 33 caribou, including caribou c99 (or c73) — the oldest known caribou in the park — who is a minimum of 17 years old. A collared male not observed during the survey, though known to be alive from his collar signal, is also included in the count. The team identified 19 males, 10 females, two yearling females and two female calves. Although these are much lower calf numbers than we have observed in the past, it is positive that all the young caribou are female.\n\nDuring the October survey, only tracks and scat were spotted in the Brazeau caribou range. Later in November, the monitoring team observed one male and one female caribou near Poboktan Pass. Remote wildlife cameras in the Winston Churchill Range on the west side of the Brazeau caribou range have captured caribou on camera several times; however, the images indicate no more than three or four animals.\n\nThe Brazeau population has declined from an estimated 45 animals in the 1980s to a minimum of four known animals in 2022. Although small populations can persist for many years, their survival is precarious. We plan to bring the remaining animals to the conservation breeding centre when it is operational to potentially increase their chances of survival.\n\nFinding Brazeau caribou\n\nDue to the small number of caribou in the Brazeau population, it is difficult to locate them in the wild reliably. Jasper National Park is testing the use of a small-scale feeding site to help locate and improve our understanding of how many caribou are in the Brazeau population. Together with Frank Roan of Mountain Cree, the monitoring team placed pelleted feed and harvested lichen in high-altitude caribou habitat at a site where we have recorded caribou before. They installed a remote camera to observe whether caribou come to feed and to count any that come by the site. Any feed left undiscovered will be removed before the end of winter.\n\nThe group took the opportunity to do a secondary survey of the Brazeau caribou range. They located a male and female near Poboktan Pass. After the caribou had moved on, the monitoring team and Frank collected scat for DNA sampling and Frank led the group in a smudge ceremony.\n\nCaribou mortality monitoring\n\nParks Canada began to use satellite-based GPS collars to monitor adult females in the Tonquin population in 2021. One of the uses of these collars is to help us better understand how, when and where female caribou die. As populations decline, they become more vulnerable to natural threats such as predation, disease and accidents. Information about caribou mortalities may help Parks Canada prevent deaths in a critically small caribou population and will be valuable for the success of Parks Canada’s new conservation breeding program.\n\nWe are already learning from the three collared caribou females that have died since we began GPS monitoring. One caribou was preyed on by a cougar in August 2022. A second caribou’s collar notified biologists of a mortality in May 2023. The cause of death is unknown because the collar and carcass were in an unsafe area to walk into; however, evidence viewed at the site later indicated a grizzly bear had eaten the carcass. In September 2023, another collared female was preyed on by a cougar. The caribou monitoring team removed the caribou carcass for future necropsy and health analyses.\n\nPredator monitoring in the Tonquin caribou range\n\nJasper National Park uses a network of remote cameras to monitor large mammals like caribou, deer and moose and predators like cougars, grizzly bears and wolves. As part of the conservation breeding program, we particularly want to understand current predator populations in the Tonquin Valley and monitor them to see how they may or may not change when caribou are eventually reintroduced from the conservation breeding centre into the wild.\n\nWe have started a pilot study using remote cameras to specifically monitor the number of predators in the Tonquin caribou range. These cameras are set up at random wilderness locations in the Tonquin Valley away from trails. Images will be used to estimate the abundance of predators.\n\nConservation breeding centre construction\n\nConstruction progress\n\nParks Canada is making significant progress towards building the caribou conservation breeding centre. Aerial images show how the site is starting to look like the design drawings. With snow on the ground, it’s easier to see the outlines of the future caribou pens, alleyways and sorting corrals.\n\nMost of the site is being prepared for caribou to eventually live and reproduce in the conservation breeding centre.\n\nThroughout the winter, forestry work will continue to remove dead pine trees and vegetation and clean up woody debris.\n\nThis is critical to protecting caribou from the risk of wildfire and injury within the pens. Smoke will be visible from the construction site as pile burning continues throughout the winter.\n\nFoundations and framing for the three buildings needed to operate the centre — the administration building, handling barn and storage shed — are complete. This winter, the three buildings will have metal roofing and siding installed and work will continue on the interiors.\n\nThe contractor has installed underground utilities needed to power the buildings and provide water to the pens throughout the site. ATCO has also begun to install a buried high-voltage power line along Wabasso Road (93A) from the breeding centre towards Wabasso Campground.\n\nGeraldine Road closed on October 1 for the winter season\n\nPublic access on the first 1.44 km of Geraldine Road is restricted to ensure safety during construction. Fryatt Trail is accessible from Athabasca Falls on a user-set winter route along the Athabasca River, once the wetlands and lake it crosses are frozen. This route is not a maintained trail.\n\nTravel on Geraldine Road during construction of the Conservation Breeding Centre\n\nAccessing Fryatt Trail in winter\n\nRead more\n\nCaribou Recovery Program Snapshot: Fall Newsletter 2023\n\nCaribou Recovery Program Snapshot: Summer Newsletter 2023\n\nArchived Newsletters\n\nContact us\n\nDo you have a question or comment?

Join our mailing list to receive the newsletters each season. Share with caribou-loving friends!\n\nIn this newsletter:\n\nFieldwork with Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Mountain Cree\n\nVisit to the Klinse-Za maternity penning project\n\nWhistlers Campground summer speaker series\n\nCaribou population monitoring update\n\nDeer density monitoring\n\nConservation breeding centre construction progress\n\nIndigenous awareness training and plant harvesting\n\nGeraldine Road information\n\nCollaboration and engagement\n\nOver the summer, Parks Canada met with interested Indigenous partner communities to discuss opportunities for collaboration on the conservation breeding program. Throughout the fall, there are plans for partners to come to the park for collaboration, knowledge-sharing and ceremony.\n\nFieldwork with Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Mountain Cree\n\nIn July, Shelley of Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Frank of Mountain Cree joined Parks Canada caribou technician Madeline to move and install wildlife cameras as part of ongoing wolf monitoring in the park.\n\nShelley and Frank shared stories about wildlife and plants in the area and their work to support caribou recovery in their territories. Madeline shared information about the remote camera monitoring work Parks Canada is doing.\n\n“Working with the caribou team at Jasper National Park recognizes the need for continued collaborative efforts. We look forward to sharing recovery work measures for southern mountain caribou that our nations are doing independently with the Jasper caribou team.” - Shelley\n\nIt was a great day spent together on the land. We are excited to continue working with these nations and others on other fieldwork and learning together.\n\nVisit to the Klinse-Za maternity penning project\n\nThe Caribou Recovery Team visited the Klinse-Za caribou maternity pen near Mackenzie, B.C. in July. The maternity pen is a partnership between the West Moberly and Saulteau First Nations and Wildlife Infometrics to reverse declines in the Klinse-Za caribou population. Maternity pens protect cows and calves from predators during calving season. The team learned about fence design, daily management of caribou and collaboration with partners. The two programs will continue to exchange information and lessons learned in the future.\n\nWhistlers Campground summer speaker series\n\nThe Whistlers Campground summer speaker series featured caribou technician Madeline in August. An audience of around 50 visitors attended to learn about the state of caribou in the park and how biologists keep track of animals in the field. Adults and children alike had the chance to come up afterwards to test out monitoring equipment and take a closer look at photos and antlers.\n\nResearch and monitoring\n\nAutumn is rutting season\n\nIn fall, mountain caribou gather together in larger groups for the rutting (or mating) season. Mature males round up groups of females above the tree line where it is easier to keep watch. A dominant bull spends a lot of time and energy chasing away younger competitors – these big guys barely have any time to eat or rest. When nobody backs down, they will battle it out to see who is strongest.\n\nThe rut is also an important time for Parks Canada’s monitoring program. It is easier to spot caribou when they are gathered in larger groups and with snow on the ground. Biologists take to the skies by helicopter to conduct an annual aerial survey and collect scat.\n\nCaribou population monitoring\n\nA new monitoring and research web page is now published on the Jasper National Park website. It features updated population estimates and information about caribou monitoring methods and research in Jasper National Park.\n\nDespite poor survey conditions during the first round of scat collection in the fall of 2022 (no snow on the ground), we were successful in finding samples from which usable DNA could be extracted. Over the summer, we received DNA data from those samples from our partnering laboratory and analyzed the information to estimate population size.\n\nTonquin population estimate\n\nA minimum of 44 individual caribou were identified by both scat DNA and the visual survey in 2022. Further analyses using all available data to estimate the Tonquin population’s size indicate there are 50 caribou (47 to 54), including an estimated 11 reproductive females (8 to 14), with a 95% confidence interval.\n\nWe collected DNA from 15 females (and observed another known female but did not get a sample of her scat). Although used primarily to inform population size, DNA findings inevitably provide other interesting results!\n\nIn 2022, we collected DNA from female Caribou 178 after three years of finding no samples of her scat.\n\nWe collected DNA from female Caribou 235 for the ninth year in a row.\n\nWe can estimate the minimum ages of these females because we have been collecting scat DNA for so many years. Six females are 2 to 3 years old, five are between the ages of 6 and 8, and three long-lived females are 12, 14 and 16 years old (at minimum)!\n\nThe Tonquin population has had a stable-to-increasing trend since 2015, indicating good ecological conditions within the range during these years. This is also reflected in annual average survival rates of 93% for adult females based on monitoring data. However, due in part to a high number of male calves born in 2022 (eight of ten total calves), we expect slower population growth in the coming years.\n\nBrazeau population estimate\n\nThe Brazeau population is too small to use statistical modelling. During aerial surveys in October 2022, monitoring staff counted a minimum of two individuals as well as tracks from additional caribou. The minimum count from scat DNA for the Brazeau is four individuals, of which three are male.\n\nDeer density monitoring\n\nThe density of deer near caribou habitat can significantly affect predator population growth. Landscape changes such as prescribed fires and wildfires create favourable habitat for species like deer, which in turn provide food for predators such as wolves and cougars.\n\nA pilot study to monitor deer density surrounding the Jasper townsite was conducted from November 2017 to May 2018 using 36 remote cameras in random, off-trail locations in the valley. The study estimated 124 white-tailed deer and 75 mule deer in the study area. Additional remote cameras were added (for a total of 84) in winter deer ranges around Jasper townsite in 2021 to get more refined population estimates and monitor changes in deer density.\n\nImages from the remote cameras were collected in late 2022. The cameras recorded over 1.4 million photos including more than 15,000 photos of white-tailed deer and 11,000 photos of mule deer. The images are being reviewed throughout the fall and a density estimate is expected to be available in early 2024.\n\nConservation breeding centre construction\n\nConstruction progress\n\nThe conservation breeding centre is starting to take shape. Concrete foundations and underground utilities for the three buildings are nearly complete. Throughout the summer, crews installed potable water reservoirs, water mains and service lines to the eventual buildings.\n\nOne of the challenges encountered this summer was finding shallow bedrock in several areas. The bedrock must be broken and excavated to ensure the water lines are buried deep enough to protect them from freezing in winter.\n\nIn September and October, the contractor will begin framing the buildings and continue to install water mains, water service lines and underground power lines. Landmark Solutions will also restart vegetation thinning and woody debris clean-up activities now that the migratory bird nesting period has closed for the year. Later in the fall, ATCO plans to begin installing a buried power line on Wabasso Road (93A) towards the breeding centre.\n\nIndigenous awareness training\n\nParks Canada provided Indigenous awareness training to roughly 20 employees and contractors of Landmark Solutions and Greyback Construction working on the breeding centre construction. The training aimed to broaden their understanding of Indigenous connections to the lands that are now Jasper National Park and the importance of caribou recovery to the Indigenous partners. Several of the employees and contractors commented on how meaningful this job was to them because of the conservation purpose of the project.\n\nPlant harvesting\n\nDuring consultations in 2022, Indigenous partners requested an opportunity to harvest plants at the construction site. It is a common practice to facilitate harvesting culturally important plants before they are destroyed or disturbed by construction projects. Parks Canada and Landmark Solutions are facilitating safe access to the site so Indigenous partners from five different communities can harvest plants in September 2023.\n\nBalancing visitor experiences\n\nAccess to the Fryatt and Geraldine Lakes trailheads was maintained throughout the summer. Trail users were safely escorted through the construction site by Landmark Solutions.\n\nGeraldine Road closes to the public on October 1 for the winter season. The road reopens in May 2024.\n\nFor more information visit Jasper National Park’s important bulletins.\n\nContact us\n\nDo you have a question or comment?

This summer newsletter is the first of Parks Canada's new quarterly updates about all things caribou in Jasper National Park. Join our mailing list to receive the newsletters each season. Share with caribou-loving friends!\n\nCollaboration and engagement\n\nCeremony\n\nBighorn Chiniki Stoney Nation conducted a pipe ceremony in March to guide the conservation breeding centre construction. We are grateful to the pipe holders for ensuring construction began in a good way.\n\nConversations with Indigenous partners about how they would like to collaborate on the conservation breeding program took place during the Jasper Indigenous Forum in April and will continue throughout the program.\n\nKnowledge exchange\n\nIn May, Jasper National Park caribou biologist Lalenia Neufeld and caribou recovery program manager Jean-François Bisaillon presented at the North American Caribou Workshop in Anchorage, Alaska. They were able to share with and learn from an international group of people working together to protect and conserve caribou and other arctic ungulates.\n\nIn May and June they also visited and exchanged knowledge with colleagues from the R.G. White Large Animal Research Station at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Wildlife Service Finland’s MetsäpeuraLIFE (Wild Forest Reindeer) Program. The Large Animal Research Station is a 130-acre research facility primarily studying musk oxen and reindeer. MetsäpeuraLIFE is a program reintroducing wild forest reindeer to their native habitat in southern Finland.\n\nResearch and monitoring\n\nCaribou population estimate\n\nParks Canada uses a statistical model (developed with the University of Montana) to calculate an annual population estimate for the Tonquin herd. The model combines all the data we collect to generate more accurate population information than any one method alone. Based on data in 2021, the Tonquin population is estimated to be 45 to 50 individuals. During aerial surveys in October 2022, monitoring staff counted a minimum of 44 individuals in the Tonquin caribou range, with 8 to 13 reproductive females.\n\nThe Brazeau population is too small to use statistical modelling, but we can use aerial surveys and scat DNA analysis to estimate the minimum number of animals. The Brazeau population is estimated to have fewer than 10 individuals. During aerial surveys in October 2022, monitoring staff counted a minimum of 2 individuals as well as tracks from additional caribou.\n\nCaribou scat DNA analysis\n\nInvestigating animal scat is a great way to get useful information without bothering the animals too much. Scat was collected in the Tonquin and Brazeau caribou ranges in October 2022 and in the À la Pêche caribou range in February and March 2023.\n\nAlmost 400 scat samples were swabbed for DNA and are currently at a laboratory for analysis. The lab can identify individual caribou by analyzing their genetic makeup. Results from DNA samples collected this past fall and winter are expected back in the fall of 2023. The genetic data will then be put into statistical models to update population estimates.\n\nCaribou mortality\n\nTen adult female caribou in the Tonquin population were fitted with satellite-based GPS collars in March 2021 and 2022. Newer technologies can provide quick notifications about mortalities and movements. When a caribou dies, the collar sends an instant notification to a cell phone. Monitoring staff can then go to the site to determine the cause of death.\n\nSince deploying the GPS collars, two caribou have died. One collared female was preyed on by a cougar in August 2022. Another mortality notification was received in early May 2023. Monitoring staff quickly flew to the location, but sighting conditions were poor, and it was unsafe to land. The team returned to the carcass on foot a couple of weeks later to find clear evidence that a grizzly bear ate the caribou and cached the remains. It is uncertain but likely that the bear killed the caribou.\n\nWolf population density\n\nThe density of wolves near caribou habitat can have a significant effect on caribou population growth. Wolves in Jasper National Park are primarily monitored using remote cameras. Individual wolves can be identified by the colours and markings on their fur. This past winter the monitoring team reviewed images of wolves (taken between July 2021 and July 2022) from more than 110 remote cameras. Using this information, the estimated wolf density for 2021-2022 is 1.9 wolves in a 1 000 km2 area.\n\nOver the 2022–2023 winter, there were likely eight main wolf packs using habitat in and around Jasper National Park. One female wolf in a pack close to the Brazeau caribou range was fitted with a GPS collar in January 2023. The monitoring team attempts to collar wolves each winter, but many factors make tracking and capturing wolves challenging.\n\nConservation breeding centre construction\n\nConstruction progress\n\nConstruction of the caribou conservation breeding centre in Jasper National Park is well underway. The majority of the centre’s 65 hectares will be forested pens for different combinations of males (bulls), females (cows), and newborns (calves).\n\nIn the spring, most of the work involved selectively removing and thinning trees and vegetation.\n\nThis will protect caribou from injury in the pens and reduce wildfire risk. About 10 hectares were cleared to prepare the areas where buildings, utilities, access roads and fences are being built.\n\nThroughout the summer, the contractor is installing underground utilities including water, sewer and electricity. They are also beginning to construct buildings—starting with soil excavation and concrete foundations.\n\nIndigenous participation\n\nThis spring, Indigenous businesses completed a substantial portion of the log-hauling and vegetation clean-up work on the construction project. Later in the project Indigenous businesses and community members will provide services in fence construction, carpentry and the work camp.\n\nParks Canada and Landmark Solutions are committed to providing subcontracting, labour and training opportunities to Indigenous partners. Progress on these commitments will be reported on in the fall newsletter.\n\nBalancing visitor experiences\n\nGeraldine Road has been graded and compacted to make the surface safe for public and construction traffic. Parks Canada and Landmark Solutions are working together to ensure safe access to backcountry hiking and camping at Geraldine Lakes and Fryatt Valley. A kiosk with a radio is available for motorists to request an escort through the construction zone during work hours.\n\nFor more information visit Jasper National Park’s important bulletins.\n\nContact us\n\nDo you have a question or comment?

Parks Canada is focusing our efforts where they can make the most difference – in the Tonquin and Brazeau herds.\n\nIt is important to increase our efforts to protect caribou in the Tonquin and Brazeau caribou ranges and to maintain the ecological conditions needed to support a potential conservation breeding program. New conservation actions include extending the seasonal closure in the Tonquin Valley from November 1 to May 15 and discontinuing private horse use in the Tonquin Valley.\n\nChanges to seasonal closures in the Tonquin Valley and other caribou ranges\n\nThis year, seasonal closures in the Tonquin, Brazeau, and À La Pêche caribou ranges of Jasper National Park again take effect on November 1 but will remain in place later than previous years. Access to these backcountry areas in critical habitat for caribou will be prohibited between November 1, 2021, and May 15, 2022.\n\nIn addition to extending the dates of the seasonal closures in all occupied caribou ranges, there are changes to the closure boundaries in the Maligne and Brazeau caribou ranges:\n\nIn the Brazeau caribou range, boundaries will be expanded on the west side of Highway 93 (in the Winston Churchill mountain range) to include areas where caribou have been observed in surveys and on remote cameras over the past five years.\n\nThe Maligne caribou range will have no access restrictions because there is no evidence that caribou remain in the Maligne herd. If caribou are observed in the Maligne caribou range in the future, the closure will be reassessed and reinstated if appropriate. Critical habitat for caribou in the Maligne range remains protected under the Canada National Parks Act and Species at Risk Act. The northern portion of the Brazeau caribou range that was historically used by both Maligne and Brazeau herds remains closed.\n\nFor a full description of the closure areas and to view detailed maps of the seasonal closures please visit: parkscanada.gc.ca/caribou-winter-access\n\nThese new measures represent stronger protection for the Tonquin and Brazeau herds and increase the likelihood of successfully rebuilding caribou herds in Jasper National Park.\n\nThis year’s changes to seasonal closures for caribou are based on ongoing research and monitoring by Parks Canada and recommendations from a scientific review of Parks Canada’s conservation breeding proposal in January 2021.\n\nBudget 2021 made over $24 million available through the Nature Legacy program for caribou conservation in Jasper National Park. Following consultation and completion of an impact assessment, Parks Canada will decide whether or not to move forward with building a conservation breeding facility in Jasper National Park. If built, young animals born in the facility would be released into the wild Tonquin herd.\n\nBackground\n\nParks Canada has a responsibility to protect critical habitat for caribou under the Species at Risk Act. Seasonal closures and access restrictions are just one way that Parks Canada is protecting caribou.\n\nClosing critical habitat for caribou in winter prevents the development of packed trails into high elevation caribou habitat.\n\nResearch shows that trails packed by backcountry skiers, snowboarders, and snowshoers from the valley bottom to high elevation areas can lead wolves to prey on caribou in the very places caribou go to avoid predators.\n\nParks Canada continually reviews and evaluates conservation measures to adapt to changing conditions using the best available information and science.\n\nWhile Parks Canada has taken steps to reduce many of the threats to caribou and create better conditions for their survival and recovery, populations are now so small that they cannot recover on their own. When caribou herds get too small, the herds become more vulnerable to natural threats such as predators, disease, and accidents.\n\nThe current predation risk to caribou from wolves is low, but wolf distribution can change quickly and have large impacts on small caribou herds in a very short time. For example, until this summer, Parks Canada had not documented wolves entering caribou habitat at high elevations at any time of year since 2016. However, GPS collars on the Sunwapta wolf pack showed the pack spending time in the Tonquin caribou range in August and September 2021.\n\nCaribou numbers are low and their survival is precarious. Losing any of the few female caribou left in the Tonquin and Brazeau herds is one step closer to local extinction.\n\nCurrent conditions in Jasper National Park support rebuilding caribou populations.\n\nJasper National Park has abundant habitat for caribou and ecological conditions are favourable to support caribou recovery. Using information gathered from sightings, surveys, and GPS collars, we have confirmed that there are at least 9 females in the Tonquin herd. We have also confirmed that three of these females are with calves born this spring, and there are likely four more pairings of cows and calves. This is a good indication that the Tonquin caribou are doing well despite their low numbers.\n\nThis fall, Parks Canada will continue to find out more about the Tonquin and Brazeau herds when we collect remote camera images from the last several months and conduct annual aerial surveys in October.\n\nThe long-term recovery of caribou in Jasper National Park requires a collaborative effort between Parks Canada, provincial governments, Indigenous peoples, and park users. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, nor is there one approach guaranteed to restore nature’s balance. Continued caribou monitoring and research will guide how Parks Canada adapts its conservation measures, based on changing ecological conditions and threats to caribou survival and recovery.\n\nInformation\n\nTo learn more about caribou in Jasper National Park:\n\nVisit parkscanada.ca/caribou-jasper\n\nEmail caribou@pc.gc.ca\n\nJoin our mailing list to receive information about the caribou conservation program in Jasper National Park, including research, monitoring, conservation breeding, and consultation.

Caribou that live in Jasper National Park are part of a subset of woodland caribou herds called southern mountain caribou. Many of these herds have been getting smaller over the last several decades and both the Maligne herd and Banff herd have disappeared.\n\nCaribou continue to persist in small numbers in the Tonquin and Brazeau herds of Jasper National Park, and in larger numbers in the À La Pêche herd on Jasper’s northern boundary.\n\nAn ongoing conservation program has helped to identify and reduce threats to this species-at-risk. Parks Canada is implementing actions set out in the Multi-Species Action Plan for Jasper National Park (2017) to support caribou conservation and recovery. Parks Canada is using the best science available to make evidence-based decisions about the actions that will most benefit caribou.\n\nCaribou recovery in Canada requires diverse actions that will vary according to local populations' habitat conditions and status\n\nEfforts to protect caribou and critical caribou habitat in Jasper National Park are part of a broader effort by federal and provincial governments as well as Indigenous partners, peoples and communities to support the recovery of woodland caribou across Canada.\n\nIn 2020, the Government of Canada reached agreements for the protection of southern mountain caribou with the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations of British Columbia, and with the Provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nParks Canada is committed to building strong and mutually beneficial working relationships with Indigenous peoples. Jasper National Park is located in Treaty 6 and Treaty 8 territories, as well as the traditional territories of the Beaver, Cree, Ojibway, Shuswap, Stoney and Métis.\n\nMore than twenty Indigenous communities, representing six unique linguistic and cultural groups, have a historical connection to Jasper National Park including First Nation, non-Status, and Métis groups in Alberta and British Columbia. Together, we address common interests and work on achieving common goals that support healing and reconnecting to the land.\n\nParks Canada is working with Indigenous peoples, provinces and territories to protect, manage, and recover caribou across the country, including in Jasper National Park. Recovery actions for caribou in Jasper are guided by the Recovery Strategy for the Woodland Caribou, Southern Mountain population (2014) and the Multi-Species Action Plan for Jasper National Park (2017), both of which were developed in cooperation with Indigenous partners, local and regional stakeholders, and provincial and federal agencies.\n\nCritical caribou habitat throughout Jasper National Park is protected under the Canada National Parks Act and Species at Risk Act\n\nCritical habitat for Woodland Caribou, Southern Mountain population is identified within the Recovery Strategy for the Woodland Caribou, Southern Mountain population in Canada (2014).\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada is currently leading a process to update this Recovery Strategy to better include Indigenous Knowledge and language, and to clarify the identification of critical habitat (including the development of more fine-scale maps).\n\nParks Canada has mapped and protects the different types of critical habitat in Jasper National Park that are identified within the Recovery Strategy. This includes the core ranges that caribou use and surrounding habitat, called matrix ranges, where changes to predator and prey species like wolves, deer, elk, and moose have important influences on caribou.\n\nParks Canada is collaborating with Environment and Climate Change Canada to include these fine-scale maps of the critical habitat that is protected in Jasper National Park in the upcoming amended Recovery Strategy.\n\nThere is strong scientific support for using conservation breeding to rebuild caribou populations in Jasper National Park\n\nWorking with partners and experts, Parks Canada has developed a proposal to rebuild the Tonquin and Brazeau caribou herds, and eventually the Maligne herd, in Jasper National Park through conservation breeding.\n\nIn January 2021, Parks Canada hosted a virtual workshop to review the scientific evidence that Parks Canada had developed towards conservation breeding in Jasper National Park, facilitated by Foundations of Success.\n\nA group of nearly 50 specialists in caribou ecology and conservation breeding came together from academia, environmental non-governmental organizations, research institutes, international conservation organizations, zoos, and federal and provincial governments and Aseniwuche Winewak Nation, a steward community of the À La Pêche herd on Jasper’s northern boundary.\n\nAs a result of this scientific review, Parks Canada is confident that there is strong scientific support for using conservation breeding as a way to increase caribou populations in Jasper National Park.\n\nFollowing the scientific review, Parks Canada is confident that:\n\nwithout our help, the Tonquin and Brazeau herds will disappear and caribou will not return to the historic Maligne Range\n\nother strategies to increase the population size of caribou herds in Jasper National Park are not likely to be effective\n\nthe threats that originally caused the decline of caribou populations in Jasper National Park have been reduced as a result of our conservation actions and long-term changes to elk and wolf populations in the park\n\ncurrent conditions in Jasper National Park support rebuilding caribou populations\n\nThe proposed conservation breeding program is feasible, as long as:\n\nParks Canada can secure suitable sources of wild caribou\n\npredators and long-term climate changes are monitored and mitigated\n\nParks Canada continues to review conservation actions to support caribou recovery, including mitigations for winter activities in the Tonquin Valley\n\nthe program is adapted based on what is learned along the way\n\nThe scientific review workshop helped to identify areas that require more consideration, including:\n\nwhere source animals will come from\n\nhow to give caribou the best chance of survival once they are released back into the wild\n\nhow to protect a conservation breeding facility from wildfire\n\nhow to mitigate the long-term effects of climate change\n\nThe broad support of the scientific community suggests that Parks Canada is on the right track with its measures to support caribou recovery in Jasper National Park. While science is the basis for decisions about caribou recovery, it is just one piece of a puzzle.\n\nParks Canada is committed to continuing to involve Indigenous peoples early and in the planning stages of the proposed conservation breeding program and facilitating ceremony throughout the process.\n\nMoving forward, Parks Canada will work with Indigenous partner communities to:\n\nformally review the conservation breeding proposal\n\nconsult on ways to integrate Indigenous Knowledge into the proposed conservation breeding program\n\nensure there are economic and employment opportunities throughout the construction and operation of the proposed conservation breeding program\n\nensure there are opportunities for Indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making in the program’s proposed governing committees\n\nParks Canada has a solid foundation to move forward with other pieces of the puzzle, including reviewing our current conservation measures, increasing monitoring of the Tonquin herd, securing suitable source animals for conservation breeding, addressing areas identified in the workshop that require more consideration, assessing the environmental impact of the project, consulting Indigenous peoples and Canadians, and refining the details of the conservation breeding and herd augmentation proposal.\n\nResearch and monitoring: How do we know what we know?\n\nDecisions made by Parks Canada regarding caribou recovery rely on scientific evidence and are based on the knowledge that Parks Canada biologists have acquired as part of a dedicated research and monitoring program for caribou in Jasper National Park.\n\nJasper National Park uses a variety of methods to collect information about caribou, deer, elk, and wolves. This information helps us understand the relationships between these animals, how they use habitat in the park, and trends in their populations over time.\n\nPopulations are now too small to calculate population estimates in the Brazeau herd, but we are able to determine a minimum number for the herd based on the number of animals seen and the results from DNA genetic analysis of caribou scat.\n\nAerial surveys\n\nAerial surveys of caribou are done by flying over caribou habitat in a helicopter and counting the number of caribou that are spotted.\n\nBiologists can collect information from this count about the minimum number of caribou that they saw and the number of calves and cows.\n\nThis data is critical to helping us understand how the population is changing.\n\nScat samples\n\nScat samples are collected during the survey to help estimate population size, survival, the ratio of males and females, and the number of calves.\n\nFrozen scat carries the animal’s DNA and allows us to identify individual caribou by comparing their genetics.\n\nScat DNA takes time to collect, process, genotype, and then run through statistical models, which means the results are typically delayed by a year.\n\nRemote cameras\n\nWe use images from nearly 100 wildlife cameras to understand how animals are using their habitat within the park.\n\nFrom these images, we can learn a lot about where caribou and wolves spend their time and at what time of year, how many wolves are in a pack, and when wolves are spending time in caribou habitat.\n\nRadio collars/GPS tracking\n\nRadio collars are used to monitor a variety of species in Jasper National Park. The collars collect animal location data and transmit data to biologists via satellite.\n\nParks Canada previously collared caribou in JNP between 2003 and 2010. Parks Canada stopped collaring after 2010 to use less invasive monitoring techniques including aerial surveys, scat DNA analysis and remote cameras.\n\nIn order to collect additional information about caribou in the Tonquin range, Parks Canada worked with experienced professionals to fit six female caribou in the Tonquin with GPS collars in March 2021.\n\nUsing collars again will allow us to understand the current causes of mortality in the Tonquin herd (where, when and how), and will help us better understand how to prevent caribou deaths. GPS monitoring is also needed to inform a potential conservation breeding program.\n\nPopulation modelling\n\nParks Canada worked with the University of Montana to develop an Integrated Population Model for caribou data.\n\nThis means that we can put together all of the data we have collected about caribou to get better information about the number of animals in the herds, the survival and reproductive rates of males and females at different life stages, and population trends.\n\nParks Canada is reviewing both the boundaries and dates of winter access restrictions in caribou habitat for winter 2021–2022\n\nIn addition to year-round conservation measures and habitat protections, seasonal closures in all caribou ranges have been in place from November 1 to February 15 in the Tonquin range and March 1 in the Maligne-Brazeau and À La Pêche ranges since 2014.\n\nIn winter, caribou are protected from predators by their high elevation habitat, where the snow is too deep for wolves to move around without sinking. Area closures prevent people from packing down trails into caribou habitat. Wolves can then use to access areas that are naturally less accessible to them in winter.\n\nThe reopening dates between February 15 and March 1 were selected in consultation with experts and stakeholders in 2013. Parks Canada's considerations included information about caribou populations and habitat use, wolf behaviours and habitat use, and opportunities for people to access the backcountry in Jasper National Park.\n\nParks Canada has always maintained the possibility of adapting winter access restrictions in response to changing conditions. Caribou populations and the density of wolves and how they use habitat in Jasper National Park have changed since closures were first implemented in 2009 and then expanded in 2014.\n\nWolf populations are dynamic and play an important role in caribou conservation.\n\nData about wolf habitat use collected through radio collars and remote cameras shows that wolves are spending most of their time in the valley bottoms where they find their primary prey of elk, deer, and moose. As a result of winter habitat closures and declining wolf numbers, we have not documented wolves entering caribou habitat at high elevations at any time of year since 2016. The current predation risk to caribou from wolves is lower than ever.\n\nIt is important to know, however, that wolf distribution can change quickly and have large impacts on small caribou herds in a very short time. While wolves in Jasper National Park are currently using lower elevation habitat, we continue to see wolves travelling on packed trails throughout the park and any trails into caribou habitat can increase the risk of caribou encountering a wolf.\n\nThe number of caribou in the Tonquin and Brazeau herds is very low, and although their population has stabilized since 2015 and is no longer in a steep decline, their ongoing survival is precarious and could change quickly.\n\nWhile the current winter access restrictions are effective and have support and compliance from recreation users, caribou in Jasper National Park are still in danger of extirpation. Parks Canada is reviewing both the boundaries and dates of winter access restrictions in caribou habitat for 2021–2022 to ensure our efforts are focused on what is most effective.\n\nParks Canada would like to thank the individuals and experts from the following organizations and groups for their contribution to the caribou program and the scientific review workshop:\n\nAseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada\n\nAfrican Lion Safari\n\nCalgary Zoo Foundation\n\nCanadian Wildlife Service\n\nCaribou Conservation Breeding Foundation\n\nDeerLab\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada\n\nfRI Research\n\nGovernment of Alberta\n\nGovernment of British Columbia\n\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature\n\nKirby Smith, Borealis Wildlife Services Ltd.\n\nKorkeasaari Zoo\n\nMetsähallitus\n\nOso Mono Ltd.\n\nSmithsonian Conservation Biology Institute\n\nSpeedgoat Wildlife Solutions\n\nThe Wilds\n\nToronto Zoo\n\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks\n\nUniversity of British Columbia\n\nUniversity of Calgary\n\nUniversity of Montana\n\nUniversity of Northern British Columbia\n\nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service\n\nWildForestReindeerLIFE\n\nWildlife Preservation Canada\n\nWildlife Service Finland\n\nYellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative\n\nYukon Wildlife Preserve\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about caribou in Jasper National Park visit our website at: parkscanada.ca/caribou-jasper Email: pc.caribou.pc@canada.ca\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nIf you would like to receive information about the caribou conservation program in Jasper National Park including research and monitoring and conservation breeding please sign up on our website at: parkscanada.gc.ca/jasper-mailing-list\n\nMedia inquiries\n\nSteve Young, Public Relations and Communications Officer\n\nTel: 780-852-6109\n\nEmail: steven.young@canada.ca\n\nPlain text version\n\nParks Canada is committed to preserving national parks and protecting the wildlife that are an integral part of these places\n\nJasper National Park is fortunate to be home to one of Canada’s most iconic wildlife species, the woodland caribou. An ongoing conservation program has helped to identify and reduce threats to this species-at-risk. This caribou research and monitoring program provides Parks Canada with the ability to make evidence-based decisions, using the best science available, to assist in caribou recovery.\n\nParks Canada has acted to reduce many of the influences on caribou decline in Jasper National Park, including:\n\nhandling roadkill differently to prevent predator population growth;\n\nrestricting access to occupied caribou ranges in winter so human trails and roads don’t give wolves easy access to the herds;\n\nprotecting caribou from being disturbed by drones and aircraft;\n\nprotecting caribou from traffic incidents with reduced speed zones.\n\nTaking these steps created better conditions for caribou survival as well as caribou recovery. Research and monitoring now indicate that current conditions in Jasper National Park can support larger caribou populations, however, the remaining herds are too small to recover on their own.\n\nCaribou recovery in Canada requires diverse actions that will vary according to the habitat condition and status of local populations.\n\nCaribou continue to persist in small numbers in the Tonquin and Brazeau herds of Jasper National Park, and in the À La Pêche herd on Jasper’s northern boundary. Parks Canada has determined that a fourth herd, the Maligne, is no longer present.\n\nParks Canada is implementing actions set out in the Multi-Species Action Plan for Jasper National Park (2017) to support caribou conservation and recovery, including assessing the feasibility of additional measures to enhance protections for caribou and their habitat and to augment caribou populations in Jasper National Park towards self-sufficiency.\n\nParks Canada has been investigating the feasibility of developing a caribou conservation breeding program and is now at the point where a proposal will undergo a review by external experts.\n\nEfforts to protect caribou and critical caribou habitat in Jasper National Park are part of a broader effort by federal and provincial governments as well as Indigenous partners, peoples and communities to support the recovery of woodland caribou across Canada.\n\nThe Government of Canada is working with provinces and Indigenous peoples to stabilize caribou populations and help them recover. The government is investing in measures to preserve critical habitat and, in February 2020, finalized two agreements for the protection of Southern Mountain caribou with the Province of British Columbia and the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations. The Government of Canada also announced on October 23, 2020, that a conservation agreement under the Species at Risk Act has been signed with the Province of Alberta that commits to taking actions required to support woodland caribou recovery in Alberta.\n\nCaribou in the Maligne Valley persisted with less than ten animals for nearly 15 years until they were last observed in 2018.\n\nThere is no evidence that caribou remain in the Maligne Range. Six separate aerial surveys of the Maligne Range (three in fall 2018, two in 2019, and most recently in October 2020) have not located any caribou or caribou tracks. In Jasper National Park, annual surveys of caribou are done by flying over caribou habitat and counting the number of caribou that are spotted. This number is a minimum count – biologists can say for certain that there is at least the number of caribou that they saw. This is done in the fall when there is snow on the ground and caribou or their tracks are most easily seen in the alpine.\n\nThe Maligne herd experienced its most rapid decline between 1998 when biologists counted 68 caribou, and 2005, when the herd consisted of less than five females and ten animals total. While this very small herd of caribou persisted in the area for nearly 15 years, a population with less than 10 reproductive females is considered functionally extirpated.\n\nIn October 2017, DNA evidence and observations in Hardisty Pass indicated that the Maligne herd had four members, consisting of an adult female called C118 and three younger animals. Five months later, in March 2018, the adult female was found dead of unknown causes. C118 was the last collared caribou in the Maligne herd and was ten years old at the time of her death. It was unknown how many other caribou remained, but tracks and scat at the site offered evidence that other caribou were present with the collared female. Surveys in the years following found no signs of caribou in the Maligne Range.\n\nAdding to year-round conservation measures and habitat protections, seasonal closures in important winter caribou habitat come in to effect on November 1.\n\nWinter closures protect over 3200 km2 of winter habitat for caribou in Jasper National Park from November to March. The purpose of these closures is to prevent people from creating trails that wolves can use to prey on caribou in places that are otherwise inaccessible. Research shows that trails packed by backcountry skiers, snowboarders, and snowshoers can lead wolves to prey on caribou in high elevation areas where caribou go to avoid predators.\n\nSince seasonal closures in caribou winter ranges were first implemented in 2009, Parks Canada has collected data about wolf habitat use through radio collars and remote cameras. This tracking data shows that wolves are more likely to use caribou habitat and valleys when trails exist and that because of closures and declining wolf numbers, fewer incursions into caribou habitat have been documented. Seasonal closures remain an important conservation tool in all occupied caribou habitat in Jasper National Park.\n\nFor maps of the seasonal closure areas, visit our website at parkscanada.ca/caribou-winter-access.\n\nBoundaries of the winter caribou habitat closure in the Maligne Range will change for the 2020-2021 season.\n\nParks Canada reviewed the closure boundary based on the evidence that no caribou remain in the Maligne Range. Considerations included the likelihood that caribou remain in the Maligne Range, patterns of caribou and wolf use in the area, the number of wolves in the park, Parks Canada’s responsibility to protect critical caribou habitat under the Species at Risk Act, high compliance with the existing closure, and feedback from environmental organizations and park users.\n\nAs of November 1, 2020, the boundaries of the winter caribou habitat closure in the Maligne Range will change to allow some limited opportunities for recreation, while maintaining 96% of the area of the Maligne-Brazeau seasonal closure that keeps a large area of the park free from human disturbance for four months of the year.\n\nThis means that winter access to some terrain in the Bald Hills and the area between Big Shovel and Little Shovel Passes is no longer restricted. Two trails allow access to these two separate areas:\n\nJeffery Creek Trail, accessed by crossing the Maligne River at Rosemary’s Rock\n\nBald Hills Trail, accessed from the parking lot at the end of Maligne Lake Road\n\nTravel along the Skyline Trail between Little Shovel Pass and the Bald Hills will not be permitted until after March 1, 2021.\n\nCritical caribou habitat throughout the national park remains protected under the National Parks Act and Species at Risk Act.\n\nIn the event that caribou are observed in the Maligne Range in the future, the closure will be reassessed and reinstated at any time if appropriate. There is no change to seasonal caribou closures in the Brazeau, Tonquin or À La Pêche Ranges from 2019-2020.\n\nDogs remain prohibited from all alpine environments in the Maligne Range year-round, including the Bald Hills and Skyline trails. For the safety of visitors, dogs and wildlife, dogs are not allowed in some backcountry areas of national parks to protect sensitive environments.\n\nInformation\n\nTo learn more about caribou in Jasper National Park visit our website at parkscanada.ca/caribou-jasper.\n\nMedia inquiries\n\nSteve Young, Public Relations and Communications Officer\n\nTel: 780-852-6109\n\nEmail: steven.young@canada.ca\n\nPlain text version\n\n*Updated* Rental Housing Development - Parcel GB - 801 Connaught Drive - Parks Canada Approval Process\n\nOver the past months, Parks Canada has received a number of comments related to the potential rental housing project on Parcel GB. We appreciate the questions and would like to take this opportunity to clarify some misconceptions and answer your questions.\n\nBackground\n\nAffordable, comfortable housing is necessary to the long-term sustainability and vitality of the community of Jasper and its residents. In recent years, the Jasper Community Housing Corporation (JCHC) has been working on advancing the development of new housing in Jasper. Through extensive community consultations to determine community needs and best use of available land, the Connaught Drive parcels (GA, GB and GC) were identified as preferred locations for the development of additional housing to meet community demand.\n\nIn 2017, in an effort to get more housing into the community as swiftly as possible, Parks Canada and the JCHC agreed to enable Parcel GB to be released for potential development, with the conditions that the units be high density (more housing), and rentals only, not for purchase. Parks Canada began the process of advertising Parcel GB for purchase across Canada. In 2020, a developer entered into an agreement to lease Parcel GB; Parks Canada has been working with them since that time to get to the development permit stage.\n\nTo enable the development of new housing, Jasper Municipal Council approved a project to install municipal utility services in the area, including water, sewer and stormwater (deep services). Complete parcel servicing of other utilities (non-municipal), including gas and electricity, is also planned, so the parcel can be ready for development. This project is anticipated to be completed in November 2021; approximately half the cost will be borne by any projects that are constructed on the GB or GC parcels.\n\nReview and approval by Parks Canada\n\nIn June 2021, the Planning and Development Advisory Committee (PDAC) advertised and held a public consultation meeting on the requested variances for the development of Parcel GB. Many members of the public, municipal representatives, and the builder were present and made comments.\n\nThe variances listed below were requested by the developer. After hearing from the developer and those in attendance at the meeting, PDAC recommended that the variances be accepted with some conditions. Parks Canada approved the proposed private development variances based on PDAC’s recommendations. To ensure the public has accurate information, we have explained below the details of each variance.\n\nA. Exceedance of maximum building height, as measured from grade level by 3.67 m.\n\nBuilding height is measured from where the grade meets the building. Although the proposed building technically exceeds the maximum height by 3.67 m, based on the slope of the lot, the roofline is actually at the same elevation of a 3-storey building when viewed at street level on Connaught Drive. This approach enabled the proponent to create a walkout basement level suitable for additional rental units that would not be visible from the street.\n\nB. A conditional reduction in parking stalls from 159 to 125.\n\nThis variance was granted with the condition that the developer work with the Municipality to identify opportunities to provide more parking stalls. The proponent reasoned the proximity of the apartments to the town’s central business district and services would attract residents with less need of a vehicle as has been done in many other communities. It is common in many municipalities to reduce parking requirements for developments close to downtown and in our community, active transportation will play an increasingly important role to help to resolve the housing crisis.\n\nC. Reduction to the size of the units from 90 m2 to 76.38 m2.\n\nThis variance was granted to enable an increase in the overall number of new housing units the development would deliver.\n\nD. The exceedance of maximum eave height by 3.45 m to 10.05 m.\n\nThis variance was granted for the same reasons as the maximum height variance described above in A.\n\nSummary\n\nThe review and approval of the proposed variances on Parcel GB followed the established process and procedures set out by Parks Canada. This development will follow the Land Use Plan in all other respects, including the Architectural Motif Guidelines for the Town of Jasper. These approvals were for variances only and the project still needs to be granted development and building permits in order to proceed.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Realty and Municipal Services section on our website by clicking here.
