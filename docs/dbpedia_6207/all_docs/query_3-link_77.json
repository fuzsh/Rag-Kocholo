        "text": "Campground Description\n\nWelcome to Black Nugget Lake Park, where history and nature come together to create a fantastic family-friendly retreat! Our park used to be a coal mine, but today, it's all about having fun and making memories.\n\nImagine a long, winding lake, perfect for gentle adventures in kayaks, canoes, and other non-powered boats. And the best part? You can go fishing! We've stocked the lake with rainbow and tiger trout, so everyone in the family can enjoy casting a line and trying to catch some fish.\n\nBut that's not all – we have lots of other activities too! Play volleyball, shoot some hoops on the basketball court, or let the kids loose on our playground.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, we've got hiking trails where you can explore the great outdoors. And if you're a bird lover, you're in for a treat – we have lots of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife for you to spot and enjoy.\n\nAt Black Nugget Lake Park, we're all about making family memories and having a great time. So, come on over and join us for some fun in the great outdoors. Your family's adventure starts here!\n\nCancellation Policy\n\nThere are no refunds for inclement weather, late arrivals, or early departures.\n\nBookings cannot be amended within 5 days (120 hrs.) of arrival.\n\nFor any changes or cancellation to this reservation, you must go to login/My bookings and select Modify/Cancel Booking\n\n“No Shows” will not be refunded under any circumstances. If you do not show up by noon the next day or make prior arrangements regarding a late check in, we reserve the right to re-book your vacant campsite.\n\nIf you wish to cancel your reservation and receive a refund, we require a notice of a minimum of 5 business days (with noon being the starting time). All cancellations will be subject to a $5 service fee. There will be no exceptions, regardless of the circumstances, so please see the examples below.\n\nExample 1: You have a reservation for a long weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights). On Sunday, you have a family emergency and you know that you will not be able to go camping on the weekend. If you contact the OFFICE by telephone or email before Sunday at 4:00:00 pm, you will qualify for a refund. This allows 5 complete business days before the 4:00:00 pm check in time at the campground on Friday. If you call at any time after 4:00:00 p.m. on the Sunday, you will not receive a refund. No exceptions.\n\nExample 2: You have a reservation that starts next Tuesday. On Thursday you decide that you have to cancel your reservation. If you contact the OFFICE by telephone or email before Thursday at 4:00:00 pm, you will qualify for a refund. This allows for 5 days notice (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday) before the 4:00:00 pm check in on Tuesday. If you call at any time after 4:00:00 p.m., you will not receive a refund. No exceptions."
