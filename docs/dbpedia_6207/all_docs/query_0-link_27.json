        "text": "Ben Haggar\n\nBen is a freelance photographer, writer, and content creator based out of Squamish, British Columbia. He also works as an Assistant Expedition Leader running logistics and executing trips in the Arctic and Antarctica. His goal as a photographer and general human being is to inspire people to go a little further, break out of their comfort zone, and discover new places and experiences at home or abroad. He specialize in taking photos of the activities he is most passionate about: remote travel and expeditions, action sports, environmental conservation, and the underwater world.\n\nLiam Binnema\n\nLiam Binnema is a Vancouver-based graphic designer. His love for the outdoors can be traced back to camping across B.C. as a child. These experiences helped develop a playful imagination, while also garnering sense of both the power and vulnerability of nature. Liam is currently in his final year of studies at Emily Carr University of Art + Design, working towards a bachelor's of design degree. His design practice (and mindful daydreams) are often exploring the contradictions of living an increasingly digitized life within an era where protecting and relating to nature is vitally important."
