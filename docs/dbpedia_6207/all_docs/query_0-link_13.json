        "text": "You can walk to Cooper Park from downtown Dryden. It's a very popular waterfront spot for picnicking and birdwatching, and the Cooper Park pathway forms part of the Dryden Signature Trail. Along the Wabigoon River, you can walk, jog and bike on a brick pathway and many people use the path to walk their dogs.\n\nYou can also play volleyball on the courts (sign-up with Riverview Lodge, 807-223-4320), use our boat launch and sight see the many nearby attractions. Parking and washroom facilities are also available for you to use. View a map of Cooper Park.\n\nThe North Dryden Rotary Park is home to our soccer complex, also called Raposo Fields. There, you'll find three available fields. You can email us to book a soccer field, or call our administration department at 807-223-1425, ext. 3.\n\nThe skatepark is also available for bikers, skaters and scooters. View a map of Dryden Skatepark/Rotary Park."
