Reflecting the overwhelming richness and variety of Ontario’s ecological, geological, and recreational treasures, each of our 115 operating provincial parks offers a unique experience for visitors. Complementing the spectacular scenery are the innovative public education programs and fascinating visitor centres found at many parks. Did you know that while all Ontario Parks are pet-friendly, some offer special designated pet exercise areas and beaches?

Before planning your visit, read up on the services and facilities available at the park. Use Ontario Parks’ handy park locator map to select a park based on its distance from your home, or by the activities and facilities that you want during your visit.

Some Ontario Parks are day-use only, while others accommodate backcountry camping or provide drive-in tent and RV campgrounds and cabin or yurt facilities.

Backcountry paddling and hiking requires some specialized skills, and safety is very important. Local outfitters/adventure companies offer exceptional planning and outfitting services for guided or self-guided trips. Here’s a complete list of the best backcountry parks and the services offered.

Snow sports enthusiasts can choose from 31 provincial parks open through the winter season. Fourteen parks offer up to three options (heated roof accommodations; trailer/tent camping, or interior/backcountry camping) for staying overnight in the winter. For a list of seasonal operating dates for each park, check here.

If you’re planning an overnight stay during peak summer season (late June through Labour Day)—or hoping to book roofed accommodations at any time of the year—it’s recommended to reserve in advance to avoid disappointment. Reservations can be made online or by phone (1-888-ONT-PARK) up to five months before your arrival date.
