The campground is in the Provincial Park Aaron. It works just like any other Provincial or National Park. You get to pick your own spot and they are not too expensive (Canada Explorer Pass does not apply here since it is Provincial). We stayed here one night and it was alright. There were no sinks to wash dishes which was unusual for parks like this. There's two very short hikes (around 1.2km each) in the park. The showers were still closed because of covid but bathrooms were available.

This is quite a pretty campground although very expensive. Many of the sites are not even close to level, and we paid $38 for no services. It was $46 for power. Apparently it closes Sept 18 for the season as well.

Report Check-In

A fine provincial park - had a good enough cell signal for some work and work calls, access to fresh water, laundry facilities ($2.50 wash, $1.25 dry) and showers.
