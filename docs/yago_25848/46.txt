One of Xenia's descendants would currently be the Head of the Romanov Family, but all of her children married morganatically, thus Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna currently holds that position.

Following the revolution Xenia and her husband separated. She became a dependent of the British Royal family who in addition to an income, granted her a grace and favour house first in Windsor Great Park and then in the grounds of Hampton Court Palace, London.

Layla;

if you can , read a book called 'The Exile' by Allan Folsom (there's an Imperial Romanov eagle on the cover). THe plot explores a very similar scenario, and problem for the family which you brought up in your previous post. Well said also!

Does this sound like the book you were talking about?

Night in the California desert. Undercover members of an elite Los Angeles Police Department homicide squad board a train in an attempt to take a cold-blooded killer into custody. But their quarry is all too aware of their presence and plots deadly, evasive action. As daybreak comes and the train nears Los Angeles, fate and the ambitions of others take a hand. Suddenly the cat and mouse game widens and John Barron, the youngest and newest member of the squad, finds himself in a brutal, deeply personal war with the killer, Raymond Thorne, that involves the LAPD, Barron's beautiful sister, Rebecca, and a rich, mysterious French baroness.

The Exile is a fierce, complex, unputdownable thriller in which the action spreads like wildfire from the sun-baked streets of Los Angeles across the face of Europe to Moscow, and then to the gilded palaces of St Petersburg where the long, exhausting trail of murder, passion and fate at last ends in a final, bloody and harrowing climax.

If it is the same book I'll have to read it to understand the similarities!

I can also recommend 'Once a Grand Duchess'. A biography of GD Xenia by Coryne Hall and John van der Kiste. Ad just recently a new book came on the market, published by Arturo Beeche (who is also one of the co-authors) about all russian grandduchesses since Paul I. Marlene Koenig has also written some chapters in this book (she is a frequent poster of royalty message boards, as is mr Beeche).

"The Grand Duchesses" by Eurohistory, I hear, is very good. I'm not sure who belongs to this forum but I know Art Beeche and Mrs. Koenig belong to the AP. Eurohistory also sells a bunch of other books including the van der Kiste book on Ksenia and the Coryne Hall one (which is autographed).

Olga and Xenia became very involved in the Anna Anderson case after they moved to Denmark with their mother. Olga Alexandrovna actually went to see Anna Anderson when she was suffering from tuberculocous in a hospital. Olga was very touched by Anderson, who was then called 'the ivalid', and said to Ambassador Zahle. "My reason cannot grasp it, but my heart tells me it is she." She spent several days with Anna Anderson, and sent her five letters with gifts. One letter said, "We shall never abandon you." A few weeks later however, Olga delivered a statement that she had known INSTANTLY Mrs. Tchaivkovsky was NOT Anastasia Nicholaevna.

Xenia was charming and practical and had a wonderful family, six sons and a daughter. Alix was neurotic and shy and demanding. It was better that she had more daughters than sons, as her sons stood a great chance, as her one son did, of having hemophilia. She had no trouble having children, just more daughters than sons, which is the luck of the draw. Xenia and Alix were friends, but as time passed Alix walled herself off from most everyone, including the family, thus causing distrust from all sides. Xenia, also felt she had too much control over the Tsar and meddled in affairs that she should not have.

Viv, not quite helpless, really, Olga just went in a different direction than her sister and was of a very different personality. She also married beneath her and that was a sore spot with relatives for a long time.

I sometimes wonder if Xenia milked it that she was the long suffering wife given GDA's womanizing ways.

You've got a point, Russophile, never really thought

about it because Xenia had her sidekicks too, didn't she?

As for the Kulikovskis: They had a long and loving marriage, but at a

price! I've been wondering whether "the sore spot" has been passed

on to the descendants of Xenia rsp. Olga?

Massie writes in his "The Romanov's The Final Chapter" about when the bones are found and they want samples of DNA from the family, the boys of GDO (Guri and Tikhon) were very suspicious about the whole affair and had a chip on their shoulders saying that people didn't believe they were descended from royalty.

As for Xenia's brood, they sort of faded into the melting pot. The only info. I know is about the one Prince that committed suicide after his father passed from and illness. Peter Kurth knew him.

At least Goerge V gave her an income and a home after she fled Russia. But I don't think he did this for Olga but do not know the reason why.

I'll have to look up the thing about the income. It's been a while since I read about Xenia and her situation but if memory serves me, and sometimes it doesn't, I think he only gave her a home because May was coveting her jewelry. But then again, I'm not sure. . .
