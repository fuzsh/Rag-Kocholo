        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II's husband is the grandnephew of the last tsarina, Alexandra Romanov, and great-great-grandson of Nicholas I. His DNA was used to identify the murdered Romanovs' remains. His descendants, including princes Charles, William, and Harry, are therefore related to the Romanovs as well.\n\nHis grandmother was first cousin to Nicholas II, and he was one of the living Romanov relatives whose DNA was used to help identify the remains of the tsar's family. He is also first cousin to Queen Elizabeth II. In England his frequent use of royal perks earned him the tabloid nickname Rent-a-Kent.\n\nAfter the unexpected death of his father in August, 25-year-old Hugh became the 7th Duke of Westminster, a billionaire, and, as the Telegraph put it, \"Britain's most eligible bachelor.\" Grosvenor is a descendant of Mikhail Romanovâ€”and, incidentally, Alexander Pushkin.\n\nThe last king of the Hellenes; his great-grandmother was a Romanov grand duchess. He was dethroned in a coup in 1967 but moved back to Greece in 2013 after a 46-year exile. King Constantine is the grandfather of T&C Modern Swan Princess Olympia of Greece.\n\nVladimirovna's son will become head of the Imperial House on his mother's death. He recently started Romanoff & Partners, a consulting firm specializing in politics and public affairs.\n\nImage of The Czar's Place, Kremlin, Moscow, Russia. Picture of Grand Duke George Mikhailovich not available.\n\nOne of Olga Andreevna's four children, Mathew is a photographer and occasional actor. He played himself in season two of Secret Princes, a TLC realty show.\n\nPicture of Franceis-Alexander Mathew not available.\n\nDaughter of Prince Andrei Alexandrovich, Nicholas II's oldest nephew. She lives in Kent, England, and organizes the annual Russian Debutante Ball in London. Currently working on a tell-all book about her royal connections.\n\nPicture of Olga Andreevna Romanoff not available.\n\nHe was born in Illinois, but Rostislav is one of the few Romanov relatives who actually live in Russia. He is the great-grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna. Based in Moscow, he is director of a watch factory founded by his ancestor Peter the Great.\n\nPicture of Prince Rostislav Romanov not available."
