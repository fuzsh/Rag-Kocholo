        "text": "Lord Louis and a Tsar’s daughte? I think not, however well bred he was on his mother’s side of the family. But after 1914 German Royal Houses would have been out as Russia and Germany were at war. In a way it’s a pity that GD Olga and CP Carol of Romania didn’t take a fancy to each other when they met, as, even though he was a nasty piece of work, Olga’s sisters could have reached sanctuary with the Romanian royals and survived the war.\n\nI agree a wealthy Russian aristocrat with a bit of Romanov blood would have been ideal, but would they have been able to leave Russia with their wealth intact before the Revolution? Doubtful imo, unless they had settled in the South of France or similar before the war.\n\nDon’t forget that his ancestress, Julia Hauke was no aristocrat, but the daughter of a secratry so middle class. Plus they followed the Germanic style of equal marriages for the most part. The Yusupovs and a few other smart Russian aristocrats did leave for France and had homes there and took whatever valuables they could.\n\nDuring Napoleon's reign as Emperor of the French, the future Leuchtenbergs were not only associated with him, but formal members of the French imperial family (the future first Duke of Leuchtenberg was the emperor's adoptive son and the house laws recognized him as a prince of the French imperial family).\n\nIn any case, your original point was that Prince Louis of Battenberg would never have been allowed to marry a Russian grand duchess. Stefan's counterexample strongly suggests the opposite.\n\nThe Leutchenbergs were nobles long before being associated with Napoleon. The Russians accepted the Leutchenbergs because at one point they were allied to Napoleon, under typical circumstances, a better match to a sovereign German Protestant House would be the usual route.\n\nAdopting the Leutchenbergs was just a way of using them to integrate and influence. Also, the Battenbergs were the product of a morganatic union and were impoverished.\n\nNicholas II would be a hypocrite to accept this hypothetical match when he exiled and castigated other male members for marrying those deemed as socially unsuitable for marriage.\n\nWho and what one Royal House deems as socially acceptable for marriage is down to the respective royal houses, one house can deem a particular royal spouse as unsuitable, others may deem that person as suitable. Also there might be a particular reason/circumstance (rare) for a particular royal head to accept a spouse traditionally as not a good match, but accept them.\n\nI think most people would agree that the Leutchenbergs would be a better match socially than the Battenbergs whose first member was the daughter of a general whose ancestors were middle class.\n\nDuring Napoleon's reign as Emperor of the French, the future Leuchtenbergs were not only associated with him, but formal members of the French imperial family (the future first Duke of Leuchtenberg was the emperor's adoptive son and the house laws recognized him as a prince of the French imperial family).\n\nThe Leutchenbergs were nobles long before being associated with Napoleon. The Russians accepted the Leutchenbergs because at one point they were allied to Napoleon, under typical circumstances, a better match to a sovereign German Protestant House would be the usual route.\n\nThat does not alter my point that the future Leuchtenbergs were members of the French imperial family and members of Napoleon's immediate family, not merely \"associated\" and \"allied\" with him.\n\nAdopting the Leutchenbergs was just a way of using them to integrate and influence. Also, the Battenbergs were the product of a morganatic union and were impoverished.\n\nBut once more, your argument was about Prince Louis of Battenberg versus Prince Maximilian of Leuchtenberg. So, are you stating that Louis was uninfluential and impoverished compared to Maximilian?\n\nWho and what one Royal House deems as socially acceptable for marriage is down to the respective royal houses, one house can deem a particular royal spouse as unsuitable, others may deem that person as suitable.\n\nI fully agree. In many debates, including parts of the current one, you have appeared to be arguing the opposite, so it is nice if you have reconsidered.\n\nThe Russian born and raised Duke Georg of Mecklenburg (1899-1963) (born Count of Carlow), who was a member of the Russian branch of Mecklenburg's and so close to the Imperial Family, talks about his childhood romantic feelings for Grand Duchess Anastasia in his memoir about his early life in Russia, Meine Erinnerungen an Rußland 1899 - 1917.\n\nExtracts below (machine translated into English from German)\n\nI paid a lot of attention to the youngest daughter of the imperial couple, the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolajevna. She was not very pretty, but had a colossally lively and expressive face and her eyes were extremely mobile with a very humorous and mischievous expression. You could see that she understood everything very quickly and saw it from the humorous side. This feeling grew within me in a very short time into a really serious one and had a far-reaching influence on my entire development. I imagined that one could get engaged at such a young age, as I had read in a biography of Henry IV of France that he was engaged to Marguerite de Valois when he was 8 or 10 years old. I heard a lot of talk about how the Emperor and Empress often talked about how difficult it would be for them to marry their daughters abroad and to be separated from them. At the beginning of 1914, one of the emperor's nieces, the daughter of his sister, the Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and the Grand Duke Alexander Michailovic, was to marry Prince Yusupov. In terms of age, I was only two years older than the little Grand Duchess. I said to myself, I was 14 years old, why shouldn't such an engagement be possible when Henry IV was already engaged when he was 8 or 10? And now something began that might seem crazy at first glance, but in reality became the beginning of my prayer life. I prayed intensively for this fantastic engagement to come about, systematically with almost physical effort.\n\n………………\n\nI usually left Petersburg by train around three o'clock and was in Carskoye after half an hour. A cozy tea awaited me and sometimes Ssandik there until it was finally time to go to the Imperial Cathedral for the evening service. There we stood in the low choirs, in a kind of box. In the middle of the church stood the Cossacks of the escort and the soldiers. Next to us stood various personalities of the entourage, such as Generals Komarov and Vojeykov, who was the palace commander at the time. The emperor arrived almost unnoticed from a side door and positioned himself to the right (from the epistle side) of the central gate of the iconostasis. The Empress stood more to the right and could not be seen. During the service, the little Grand Duchess turned around very often, which from time to time provoked comments from her older sisters.\n\n…………………\n\nAt the end of the service the emperor came out from his place in the middle to kiss the cross. He was followed by the Empress and then her daughters. When it was Anastasia Nikolajevna's turn, she looked at me very quickly, so one of her sisters pushed her so that she could get to the cross more quickly. Then they all got into a car and drove straight to the train station.\n\nThat does not alter my point that the future Leuchtenbergs were members of the French imperial family and members of Napoleon's immediate family, not merely \"associated\" and \"allied\" with him.\n\nBut once more, your argument was about Prince Louis of Battenberg versus Prince Maximilian of Leuchtenberg. So, are you stating that Louis was uninfluential and impoverished compared to Maximilian?\n\nI fully agree. In many debates, including parts of the current one, you have appeared to be arguing the opposite, so it is nice if you have reconsidered.\n\nNot sure why Maximillien is being brought into the debate. He is not related to the French connected Leuchtenbergs.\n\nMaximillien yes was high born, the younger son of the Elector of Bavaria, and his mother was an Austrian Archduchess. But he died childless and his duchy was absorbed once again.\n\nThe Leuchtenberg line that married into the Swedish royal house etc is not connected to Maximillian. Yes they had noble blood but far more minor, and would have been considered a morgantic marriage without Napoleon. If his mother had not married the French emperor, Eugene would have simply been the son of a minor Viscount.\n\nBy any marriage that considers marriage to the nobility to be morgantic aka the Russians, neither the Battenbergs nor the Leuchtenbergs would have been acceptable on any front.\n\nLouis' father certainly was. Louis' Aunt was the wife of Alexander II. But his marriage to Louis' mother made Louis and his siblings unacceptable for an equal marriage.No matter how much wealth or influence they could build up, they could not over ride their lack of royal status. Fortunately for Philip, the Brits did not have rules about morgantic marriages.\n\nNot sure why Maximillien is being brought into the debate.

In 1839 he married Grand Duchess Maria of Russia, the daughter of Emperor Nicholas I.\n\nThe Maximilian of Leuchtenberg I believe you are referring to was Maximilian of Bavaria Duke of Leuchtenberg (1638-1705), the son of Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria and wife Maria Anna of Austria.\n\nThe two Maximilians were distantly related, through the younger Maximilian's maternal grandfather (and namesake) King Maximilian I of Bavaria."
