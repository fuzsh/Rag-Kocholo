        "text": "It is often claimed by the members of the Romanoff Family Association that their antecedents “never” recognized Grand Duke Kirill or his son, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. It is possible that family “oral tradition” has changed through the years, but documents from the period which survive tell a clear and different story.\n\nIn 1938, an important document was released by the surviving members of the Imperial House. It provided the names of all living males who were members of the Imperial House, listed in order of primogeniture, and it omitted the names of all living males who were NOT members of the Imperial House and therefore did NOT have rights to the throne, due to the unequal or morganatic marriages of their parents\n\nThis letter, dated 1 November, 1938 is from H.H. Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia, the eldest son of the Emperor’s sister, H.I.H. Grand Duchess Xenia, and her husband, H.I.H. Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia. The text reads as following:\n\nDear Andrei (1),\n\nMama (2) showed me the content of your letter and the statement that you have prepared for distribution. I have not signed it because I was not at the family meeting and I do not know what you all decided, and secondly I do not see why the Family needs to sign this statement when it all goes without saying (3). After the death of Cyril as the head of the imperial house, of course his son succeeds to the Headship. I personally recognized the father as I now recognize the son.\n\nVladimir, however, must issue his address himself, to confirm his position as head of the house\n\nI embrace you firmly,\n\nYour Andrei\n\nGreetings from Andy (4) and from both of us (5) to Your wife and Vova (6).\n\nThis letter confirms that H.H. Prince Andrei Alexandrovich, the father of Andrew Andreievich Romanoff and Olga Andreievna Romanoff duly acknowledged the headship of the Romanov Dynasty of first Grand Duke Kirill and subsequently, his son, Grand Duke Wladimir.(7)\n\nH.I.H. Grand Duke Andrei Wladimirovich\n\nH.I.H. Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna.\n\n“all goes without saying” meaning that the succession is clearly indicated by virtue of the Fundamental Laws.\n\n“Andy” the 15-year-old Andrew Andreievich Romanov (b. 1923),\n\n“both of us” Prince Andrei Alexandrovich and his morganatic wife, the former Princess Elisabetta di Sasso-Ruffo, and\n\n“Your wife and Vova” Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich’s wife and son Princess Mathilde Romanovsky-Krassinsky (nee Kschessinskaya) and Prince Vladimir Romanovsky-Krassinsky.\n\nIn 1924, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and 4 of his 6 sons signed a formal oath of allegiance to Grand Duke Kirill Wladimirovicb as head of the House and with Wladimir as Tsesarevich. His son, Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich did not sign as he was in NY - but Prince Dmitri later recognized Grand Duke Kirill, and asked him for a morganatic title for his wife, Countess Marina Golenischeva-Kutuzova. Grand Duke Alexander’s son Prince Vassily was not asked to sign in 1924 because he was a minor. Prince Andrei Alexandrovich, as 6th in line after Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich (directly after Grand Duke Gavriil Konstantinovicn) was asked to sign the 1938 declaration, and this letter explains why he thought this was not necessary."
