        "text": "Investigating the Regional Labour Market for Indigenous Language Teachers, Administrators and Service Providers was spearheaded by Shingwauk Education Trust to inform future program development for Shingwauk Kinoomaage Gamig’s Anishinaabemowin BA program. The project consisted of two phases, the first being an environmental scan of previous program graduates to assess (1) What careers program graduates pursued after completing their degree, and (2) what factors of the program enhance graduates’ employability. The second phase consisted of a labour market survey focused on employers and service providers of Anishinaabe communities. The labour market survey investigated (1) in which industries is there demand for fluent Anishinaabemowin speakers, and (2) what specialized skills graduates require for these occupations. Additional policy recommendations are proposed to respond to the needs of speakers, the labour market, and community desire to promote the use of Anishinaabemowin.\n\nIn this article I examine the structural barriers in the recertification trajectory of internationally educated teachers (IETs) in British Columbia (BC). By applying the Bour-dieuian concept of field, I extend from IETs' experiences in the recertification process to institutional and political factors that affect these experiences. I demonstrate how policies and regulations that govern the field as well as the interplay between its main institutional players, namely, the Teacher Regulation Branch, teacher education programs, and school districts, result in unequal opportunities for IETs to be certified and hired as teachers. As a result, IETs' potential contribution to diversifying the teacher force in BC is diminished. Canadian Journal of Education / Revue canadienne de l'éducation 40:3 (2017)\n\nThe calls by the Ministry of Education for extended teacher education in 2012 reflect restructuring without reconceptualization, which, Grimmett (1995) argues, “does not lead to genuine change in teacher education” (p. 202). As we stated in our introduction, our reconceptualization of teacher education was informed by Grimmett’s three approaches to restructuring; namely restructuring that arises out of reconceptualization. In Ontario, with the severely restrictive time allowed to reconceptualize and restructure new programs for 2015, we continue to question if we have been able to engage in a rich reconceptualization of teacher education alongside of the externally imposed restructuring to the degree that we would wish. To meet the goals articulated by Grimmett (1995), Korthagen (2001), Kincheloe (2004), Loughran (2006), and Russell and Loughran (2007) to name but a few who call for reconceptualization of teacher education, we need to break free of the old ways of thinking about teacher education. Here, Thomas and Kane (2016) suggest that this would require significant shifts in the ways we as university-based teacher educators view our roles in the preparation of teachers, our commitment to partnerships with school-based teacher educators and how we understand one becomes a teacher. It will also most importantly require authentic and sustained collaboration with teachers and schools and key partners within the wider community. This is one of the directions we are heading as we continue to work toward developing, implementing, and living a teacher education program that reflects a reconceptualization grounded in innovative practices and partnerships. The promises of such reconceptualization take time. Only now are we seeing some of the recommendations of the 1990s come to fruition. Time will tell, if our program lives up to its future promises."
