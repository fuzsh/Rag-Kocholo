The ministers responsible for education in the provinces and territories come together as the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada, CMEC, to discuss or take action on matters of mutual interest. (From the CMEC website). Links to the provincial and territorial departments of Education are also available on the CMEC website.\n\nOntario Ministry of Education\n\n(MOE) is responsible for delivering early years, child care and publicly funded education from kindergarten to Grade 12 in Ontario. The role of the MOE is to:\n\nDevelop policy and programs to support child care and early years programs for children and families.\n\nMake sure child care settings are safe and follow the law by funding, licensing and inspecting licensed child care providers.\n\nFund and provide guidelines for the delivery of core services at EarlyON child and family centres.\n\nFund and oversee publicly funded elementary and secondary school education.\n\nDevelop and publish curriculum documents and teaching resources for Kindergarten to Grade 12.\n\nSet provincial standards and guidelines for all assessment, evaluation and reporting for all students who attend public or private schools in Ontario.\n\nOversees and sets policies for the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO), which administers provincial assessments to help improve student learning in reading, writing and math.\n\nSet requirements for student diplomas and certificates.\n\nProvide funding to build new schools and expand, retrofit or repair existing schools.\n\nOperate schools for blind, deaf and deafblind students.\n\nRegister and inspect private schools that offer credits toward an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD).\n\nOntario College of Teachers\n\n(OCT) The Ontario College of Teachers was created after the Ontario government passed legislation to allow the teaching profession to regulate itself.
