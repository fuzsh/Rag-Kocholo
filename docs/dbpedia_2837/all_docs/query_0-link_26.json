        "text": "This online master’s degree program is offered through Niagara University’s main campus in Lewiston, NY to individuals interested in becoming certified teachers.\n\nOur 39-credit hour online program leads to certification in either:\n\nEarly Childhood and Childhood Education (Birth-Grade 6/Primary-Junior grades)\n\nMiddle Childhood and Adolescence (Grades 5-12/Intermediate-Senior grades)\n\nThis program is designed for candidates who wish to become certified teachers in New York State. For international students including those in Canada, this program may meet certain requirements for certification in other jurisdictions.\n\nOur master’s degree is designed as a three-semester program for full-time study. Students can begin their program in either the summer (May), spring (January), or fall (August) semesters. A summer start allows students to complete the program in one calendar year. Students who begin in the fall or spring can complete the program in 15 months. Coursework and 150 field hours are completed during the first two semesters, and the final semester includes student teaching and seminar. Part-time options are also available.\n\nAll coursework for the program is completed fully online with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous course offerings. Most courses will be offered synchronously and are scheduled 2-3 days per week. Students must also factor in time for their field experiences during the week.\n\nWe utilize a cohort-based model which allows our students to develop more meaningful professional relationships with one another. This adds to the peer support that candidates experience within their group while at Niagara University, in field experiences, student teaching, and later as alumni.\n\nThe College of Education at Niagara University has proven a record of quality programs that provide students with extensive practical field experience, state of the art\n\ninstructional technology and an outstanding career placement reputation. Upon completion of the program, Ontario students are able to apply for both certifications in New York State and Ontario."
