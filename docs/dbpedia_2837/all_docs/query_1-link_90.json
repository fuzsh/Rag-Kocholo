        "text": "What it Takes to be a Personal Support Worker\n\nThe Personal Support worker is an integral part of the team that provides care to seniors in their homes, retirement residences or long-term care facilities. The Personal Support Worker (PSW) role involves multiple aspects of daily living activities. These can include:\n\nPersonal care; helping a person with bathing, grooming, oral care, dressing, toileting, and feeding.\n\nHelping with mobility and transferring such as assisting a person with walking, positioning, and transferring from bed to chair.\n\nHousehold management, such as menu planning, meal preparation, cleaning, laundry, and grocery shopping.\n\nIf you have an interest in and enjoy working with the aging population in a variety of healthcare and community settings, this program may be for you.\n\nWhat Can I Expect?\n\nWhat can you expect in the Humber PSW program that is exciting and interesting?\n\nYou will be part of a very culturally diverse student population. This will help you to increase your awareness of your own culture and the positive aspects of other cultures.\n\nIn the first semester of the PSW program there are over 100 students. While this sounds large, the class sizes are small. There are approximately 45 students per theory section and 8-10 students per clinical group. Within those groups you will develop support systems, networks, and friends to help you.\n\nYou will have professors and clinical teachers who are extremely well prepared academically and professionally. All professors and clinical teachers are registered nurses or registered practical nurses who have worked in long-term care, hospital, or community settings before their work in post-secondary education.\n\nThe goal of all the professors is to help you succeed in the program; however, your success is a shared responsibility, and you must do your part by attending classes and clinical, completing assignments on time, and studying for examinations.\n\nThe program includes mandatory field placements where you will have the opportunity to practice your newfound skills and knowledge with supervision. It is paced to match the level of knowledge you have gained from the theory courses. Field experiences include long term care and community agencies. Humber has relationships with more than 100 agencies and makes every effort to give you the best possible experience in all the areas you could potentially work in after you have graduated."
