        "text": "It is fitting, in ETFO’s 10th anniversary year, that we celebrate its successes. However, we must also look, acknowledge and reflect on the challenges that bind the 155,000 members of the Ontario Teachers’ Federation (OTF). One of these is the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT). Since its inception in 1996, many aspects of the college have been a source of grave concern for federation.\n\nFirst, it is important to differentiate between the mandates of the two organizations. OTF is responsible for advocating on behalf of the profession, while the college regulates the profession in the public interest. Often in the years since its formation, the college has been perceived as straying beyond its mandate and undertaking initiatives that are both costly and unnecessary. This has led to numerous discussions about the OCT fee between OTF and the college.\n\nTeachers want their college to use their fees prudently. Most members believe that the OCT annual membership fee of $104 is too high. They will be disappointed to learn that the college’s governing council recently endorsed an annual fee of $120 for three years beginning in 2009. The chair of council, an elected member, justified this increase in a recent article of ProfessionallySpeaking by indicating additional need in the areas of accreditation, investigations, and hearings as well as the need to purchase a building or secure office space.\n\nLet’s be clear: councillors should fulfill their mandate and their fiduciary responsibilities. Indeed, it is a legislative requirement. However, the funding of activities that stray beyond the OCT mandate should not be tolerated. The excessive manner in which the college undertakes some of its initiatives (for example, OCT’s attendance at job fairs in Quebec, New Brunswick, and New York) must be curtailed. College staff presenting professional learning activities for teachers around the province is an undertaking not contemplated in its mandate and therefore should cease.\n\nThe college offices are currently located in the Bloor-Church area of Toronto, prime real estate that the college is continuing to consider for its permanent facility. Its proximity to Queen’s Park should not be a factor. Real estate in other areas serviced by Toronto’s transit system could be significantly cheaper and still accessible for members and staff. The selection of a facility must be guided by fiscal responsibility.\n\nOver the course of a decade, there have been improvements in the OCT’s governance structure. When the Harris Tories passed the OntarioCollegeofTeachersAct in 1996 it established a governing council of 31 members, 17 of them elected. Of these, only 13 were OTF members.\n\nThe federation had numerous concerns. The College was seen as the vehicle by which the government carried out its policies and regulations (Ontario teacher qualifying test, recertification, teacher performance appraisal). As a result, the college had very little credibility among the members. The entire notion of a self-regulating body was fundamentally flawed because the governing structure did not have a majority of teachers.\n\nIn 2006, following an intensive lobbying campaign by OTF members, the Liberal government amended the Act. OTF members now have a slight plurality on the governing council.\n\nOverall a more constructive relationship now exists between OTF and the college. Nevertheless, there are numerous outstanding issues. Hopefully, when ETFO celebrates its 20th anniversary, a more positive reflection will be outlined."
