        "text": "Our Story\n\nHow CANTEACH Got Started\n\nCANTEACH is the Official Canadian agent for Universities in New Zealand, Scotland and Wales (exclusively).\n\nCANTEACH was created for Canadians who want to do their Teachers College in New Zealand, Scotland, Wales or Australia and obtain their teacher certification. As a Canadian, who has studied and taught abroad, I am aware of the many benefits that this type of experience has to offer. During my time teaching at a teachers college in Buffalo, NY, I was amazed at the length and effort students would go to to obtain their teaching certificate. When I moved to New Zealand, it became apparent that Canadians needed to come to New Zealand for Teachers College. The UK was also a destination that I added and has many benefits for Teacher Training abroad in both Scotland and Wales.\n\n**CANTEACH students are able to apply and attend CANTEACH University options abroad for the July 2024, Fall 2024 and Feb 2025 academic year and beyond. Teacher Education Programs are available for CANTEACH students at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT-NZ), the University of Canterbury (UC), the University of the West of Scotland (UWS-Scotland) and Cardiff Metropolitan University (Cardiff Met-Wales).\n\nJuly 2023 and January & February 2024 CANTEACH groups are currently studying in Auckland, New Zealand (AUT) and Christchurch, New Zealand (UC). CANTEACH students are completing their programs at Cardiff Metropolitan University and the University of the West of Scotland May & June 2024. AUT July 2024 students (AUT) will be heading to New Zealand soon. Students attending Cardiff Met and UWS will also be heading to the UK in August. October 20th marks the January and February 2025 Pre-departure meetings for UC and AUT and an Information session for UWS and Cardiff Met Fall 2025 groups (last updated July 17th, 2024).**\n\nThe CANTEACH Advantage for you\n\nOriginally, the opportunity to travel while doing a one (1) year Teachers College program abroad, studying in New Zealand, Scotland or Wales, had many benefits to offer: wonderful people, the experience of a different culture, obviously living abroad and the chance to take part in world class training programs for preparing Teachers and Professionals. These benefits continue to be available to CANTEACH students and now, with the additional benefits of: saving a year of study, one (1) year abroad instead of two (2) in Ontario, saving approximately 12-15K for the second year’s living expense in Ontario; and the ‘opportunity cost’ of working and Teaching for a year instead of being in University in Ontario. The option of going abroad for Teachers College has really solidified itself as the option of choice for CANTEACH students. Upon completion of the program, Mike Johnson assists ALL CANTEACH students in receiving their full certification back in Ontario/Canada through a tried process set up for all Canadian students that attend CANTEACH University Programs.\n\n“I am Canadian and I live in Christchurch, New Zealand. The combination of my 31+ years of experience, being Canadian, living abroad and enthusiasm for the teaching profession, I guarantee that I will take care of you. I look forward to working with you.”\n\nBackground and Experience\n\nThe Director of CANTEACH has been working with Canadians training abroad since 1992.\n\nMany Canadians look to broaden their personal and professional horizons by studying for their Teaching Certificate abroad. Mike Johnson has taught and/or worked with Canadians studying abroad to obtain their teaching certificate for over 31 years.\n\nCANTEACH chooses only those Universities that liaise with governing boards like the Ontario College of Teachers, and other governing boards, for certification purposes in Canada and that support students to get Certified in Canada. These Governing Boards evaluate the programs promoted by CANTEACH and it’s member University programs meet the requirements to allow students to be able to become certified Teachers in Canada.\n\nMike’s Profile:\n\nDirector of CANTEACH for over 21 years (since March 2003).\n\nWorking with Canadians abroad for over 31 years (since August 1992).\n\nFormer Director of Student Teaching (Placements/assessment in Schools)\n\nFormer Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Assistant Professor\n\nTeaching Experience in Canada, New Zealand and USA\n\nMike Johnson is a certified Teacher in Ontario and Alberta\n\nCertification workshops and instructions provided to all CANTEACH Students by Mike Johnson\n\nEvery CANTEACH student that has completed their teacher training program abroad has been certified in Ontario/home province.\n\nCANTEACH has quality programs for Canadians wanting to become Certified Teachers in Canada."
