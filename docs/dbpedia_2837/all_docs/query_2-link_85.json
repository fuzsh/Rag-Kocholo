        "text": "It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education to oversee all aspects of Ontario’s public education system.\n\nThe Education Act\n\nOntario’s Education Act is the main law that governs how public school education is delivered. Section 0.1(2) of the Act states that “the purpose of education is to provide students with the opportunity to realize their potential and develop into highly skilled, knowledgeable, caring citizens who contribute to their society”.\n\nThe Act sets out the duties and responsibilities of the Minister of Education, school boards, supervisory officers (superintendents), principals, teachers, parents, and students.\n\nWhat are the duties of principals?\n\nPrincipals are responsible for the management of individual schools. Principals can have one or more vice-principals to assist them with the management of a school. As set out in section 265 of the Act, the following is an overview of the main duties of principals:\n\nOverseeing the teaching and curriculum in the school.\n\nSupervising teachers and other staff that work for the school, including the assignment and evaluation of teachers.\n\nAccepting students into the general and special education categories.\n\nCreating a budget for the school and ensuring all the school’s facilities are maintained.\n\nAllocating staff to the appropriate departments and appointing department heads, arts specialists, or library staff.\n\nMaintaining student records and ensuring report cards are sent to parents.\n\nOverseeing student discipline and making decisions about suspensions and possible expulsions.\n\nWhat are the duties of teachers?\n\nTeachers are certified and qualified professionals who teach in Ontario’s public and independent schools. Every public school teacher must be licensed by the Ontario College of Teachers. The primary duties of teachers as per section 264 of the Act are to:\n\nPrepare lesson plans, teach classes, and evaluate student progress\n\nMaintain discipline in the classroom\n\nRun extra-curricular sports, clubs, and activities (voluntary)\n\nCommunicate with parents about a student’s progress\n\nWhat is considered a breach of duty for principals or teachers?\n\nIf a principal or teacher does not fulfill their respective duties as set out in the Education Act, it may be considered a breach of duty. For example, if principals do not maintain the facilities in their school, this behavior would be considered a violation of the Act. If a teacher failed to evaluate a student’s progress, this would also be a violation of the Act.\n\nOntario College of Teachers / Ontario College of Teachers Act\n\nIn addition to the duties of principals and teachers set out in the Education Act, educators must also conduct themselves professionally. The Ontario College of Teachers Act, under the Ontario College of Teachers sets and maintains the professional standards that educators are expected to follow. For example, an educator cannot use social media to connect with students about intimate or sexual matters. The responsibility is always with the educator to set and maintain the appropriate professional boundaries.\n\nFor more information on professional standards, refer to the Ontario Teacher’s College’s Ethical Standards for the Teaching Profession.\n\nWhat are the consequences if a principal or teacher breaches their duties?\n\nUnder the Ontario College of Teachers Act, members found guilty of professional misconduct may lose their license to teach and be subject to other types of member discipline. The College of Teachers is responsible for investigating these types of complaints made against its members and disciplining members accordingly. For information on what constitutes misconduct, view the Ontario College of Teachers Act, Professional Misconduct Regulation. View the College of Teachers Complaints and Discipline Process for more information on how complaints are handled.\n\nA breach of duty under the Education Act is dealt with through an internal complaint process, which may begin with a complaint made to the principal. If the matter is not resolved or involves a principal, the School Board will then become involved. Most complaints are resolved informally. More information can be found from the Ontario Ombudsman for Education.\n\nIn rare cases, an educator may also face civil and criminal prosecution if the conduct constitutes criminal behavior and is considered a Criminal Code offense.\n\nMore info\n\nFor more information regarding the duties and responsibilities of educators, view the Education Act.
