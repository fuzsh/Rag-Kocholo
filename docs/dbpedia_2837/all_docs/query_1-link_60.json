Students should expect to be involved in the program five days each week, completing a combination of coursework and community/school placements.\n\nApplication Deadlines\n\nPlease be advised that programs in the Faculty of Education are intended to be delivered on campus or in official offsite locations in Toronto; community placements can only be completed in partner organizations and school placements can only be completed at partners school boards, which are located in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
