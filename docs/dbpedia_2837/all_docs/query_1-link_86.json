        "text": "Peterborough, ON (Aug. 6, 2024) - High School Students Learn Skilled Trades During Summer START!\n\nDozens of students from three area high schools came together at the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre for an immersive, hands-on experience during the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board’s annual Summer Start! program.\n\nOpen to students entering Grade 9, this event involved over 150 students from Bowmanville High School, Cobourg Collegiate and Thomas A. Stewart Secondary School. Students who complete all four weeks of the program receive a high school credit.\n\nStudents spent one day each week at Fleming College, working with Fleming staff who set up interactive workshops in plumbing, carpentry, welding and trade sciences. During these sessions students were given projects to design and work on.\n\nThese unique summer workshops gave students a chance to explore skilled trades under the guidance and mentorship of Fleming’s faculty.\n\nStudents also had a chance to see the innovative resources and programming Fleming offers at the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre and explore the possibility of training for an exciting career close to home.\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\n\nSarah Deeth\n\nCommunications Officer\n\nsarah.deeth@flemingcollege.ca\n\n705-749-5530 ext. 1161\n\nAbout Fleming College\n\nFleming College respectfully acknowledges that we are situated on Michi Saagiig Anishinaabeg lands and territory. Located in the heart of Central Ontario, Fleming College has campus locations in Peterborough, Lindsay, Cobourg and Haliburton. Named for famous Canadian inventor and engineer Sir Sandford Fleming, the college features more than 100 full-time programs in Arts and Heritage, Business, Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, General Arts and Sciences, Health and Wellness, Justice and Community Development, Skilled Trades and Technology, and Continuing Education. Fleming College has more than 6,800 full-time and 10,000 part-time students, and 80,000 alumni.\n\nWeb: flemingcollege.ca\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/flemingcollege\n\nTwitter: @FlemingCollege\n\nInstagram: @flemingcollege\n\nTikTok: @flemingcollege\n\nPeterborough, ON (July 24, 2024) - Fleming College is proud to announce that it has been awarded a College Fund research infrastructure grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI).\n\nThis significant investment of $227,753 from CFI, combined with other secured grants, will cover the costs for Fleming to purchase a state-of-the-art laser machining technology. At a price tag of approximately half a million dollars, the sought-after technology will be used to design and produce complex Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).\n\nThe funding was part of an announcement made in late June by the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of National Revenue, on behalf of the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry.\n\nPCBs are essential components in nearly all electronic products, including household appliances, automotive systems, healthcare devices, and more.\n\nThe research team at Fleming College’s Centre for Advancement in Mechatronics and Industrial Internet of Things (CAMIIT) boasts an extensive track record in designing and creating PCBs and has the capability to prototype a wide range of PCBs in-house.\n\nHowever, like many others in Fleming College’s region, CAMIIT has often had to outsource the production of complex PCBs to foreign manufacturers. This process could take several weeks, and lead to increased research costs and a heightened risk of intellectual property infringement.\n\nThanks to this new funding from CFI, Fleming’s CAMIIT researchers can now produce complex PCBs in the lab in Peterborough, significantly enhancing their research capabilities, efficiency, and security. Using a high precision laser cutter, this will enable CAMIIT to create PCBs for a variety of industries in as little as two days.\n\n\"This CFI College Fund grant is a game-changer for Fleming College,\" said Fleming College President Maureen Adamson. \"CAMIIT’s new laser machining technology will fill a significant gap in our region's innovation ecosystem, empowering our researchers and students to engage in cutting-edge research and development projects. It's a transformative step for our institution and the broader community.\"\n\nAfter its doors opened in 2021, Fleming College’s CAMIIT quickly became a hub in Eastern and Central Ontario for conducting applied research projects that lead to the design, development, prototyping, and improvement of products and technologies for use in the Mechatronics, Wireless Communication, Artificial Intelligence, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) markets. CAMIIT’s impressive laboratory and research space at Fleming’s campus in Peterborough has been designed to meet the needs of industry-focused projects.\n\n“The acquisition of this technology opens up new avenues for collaboration with industry partners from our region and beyond,” continued Adamson. “This will undoubtedly enhance our applied research program and help foster a new generation of skilled professionals ready to meet the demands of the evolving tech landscape.”\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\n\nSarah Deeth\n\nCommunications Officer\n\nsarah.deeth@flemingcollege.ca\n\n705-749-5530 ext. 1161\n\nAbout Fleming College\n\nFleming College respectfully acknowledges that we are situated on Michi Saagiig Anishinaabeg lands and territory.
