Applicants are encouraged to review this content carefully to ensure they are following the most up-to-date instructions.\n\nOverview\n\nTo teach in Alberta, you must hold a valid Alberta teaching certificate issued by Alberta Education. Alberta Education is the only body that can assess credentials for teaching authority in Alberta.\n\nGenerally, you will need to:\n\nApply for Interim Professional Certification so that Alberta Education can assess your educational and professional qualifications.\n\nIf you meet the requirements, you will be issued Interim Professional Certification, which allows you to teach in an Alberta-accredited school and is valid for 3 years.\n\nWhen you meet all the requirements for Permanent Professional Certification, your school authority must recommend you for a permanent certificate.\n\nBefore you apply\n\nYou can apply for teacher certification as a graduate from a teacher preparation program from Alberta, another province or territory in Canada or outside of Canada. However, there are some special considerations to note as you complete your application.\n\nAlberta applicants\n\nHere is a brief video on how to apply for teacher certification for students graduating from an Alberta teacher preparation program.\n\nTemporary teaching authority\n\nAlberta applicants with an employment offer ahead of graduation are eligible for a 90-day temporary teaching authority.\n\nSubmit your Interim Professional Certification application, including all required documentation and fees, at least 8 weeks before the end of your degree program.\n\nWe will process your application for a pre-certification letter in approximately 20 business days.\n\nRequest an offer letter from your prospective employing school authority.\n\nTake the pre-certification letter and the offer letter from your employer to the dean of your Education faculty and request an early clearance letter stating you have successfully completed your program and will be recommended for teacher certification.\n\nWith these 3 letters, you are authorized to teach for 90 days.\n\nWhen the dean’s recommendation list is received by Alberta Education, your Interim Professional Certification will be issued and mailed to you.\n\nCross-Canada Labour Mobility applicants\n\nUnder the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, teachers who hold a valid teaching certificate from another Canadian jurisdiction are eligible for certification in Alberta without requiring additional education, training or examination.\n\nIndividuals must still apply for Alberta teacher certification and may be eligible for either Interim Professional Certification or a Letter of Authority with the same scope of practice as authorized by your valid teaching certificate from the other Canadian jurisdiction.\n\nInternationally-educated applicants\n\nAll applicants must meet the below criteria. Academic credentials will be assessed on a course-by-course basis. If your program is not acceptable to the Minister of Education, you may need to take additional courses to qualify for Interim Professional Certification.\n\nWhen your assessment is complete, you will receive a letter of assessment in the mail that details the outcome of your application.\n\nApply for Interim Professional Certification\n\nApplications will not be processed until the application fee is received.\n\nApplicants have one year to complete the application. Applicants must ensure all required documentation has been provided within one year, after which time the application will be closed.\n\nStep 1: Check your credentials\n\nAll teachers in Alberta require at minimum 4 years of university education, inclusive of a recognized degree and pre-service teacher preparation program from an approved institution.
