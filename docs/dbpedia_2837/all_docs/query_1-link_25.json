        "text": "A statement of intent is not required. Instead, you must enter your response to each question in the text box provided in the online application. Do not upload a separate document.\n\nIn the Master of Teaching (MT) Program, there are three divisions to choose from - Primary/Junior, Junior/Intermediate, and Intermediate/Senior. The online application system requires a separate application for each division. If you’re applying to more than one MT division, please rank order your applications and be sure to use the exact same application materials (resumé, responses to faculty questions, referees, transcripts, instructional experience chart). With the exception of your rank order, you will need to copy and paste your responses to the Faculty Questions to subsequent MT division applications, therefore, keep a copy to reuse. Do not apply to the same MT division more than once.\n\nOISE is committed to admitting teacher candidates who show openness and commitment to working towards equity and socially just practices within diverse classrooms, schools, families, and communities. See the OISE Guiding Principles on Equity and Diversity. You will be asked to answer the following questions.\n\nQuestion: Describe significant teaching and/or teaching-related experiences (up to a maximum of three experiences, at least one with a group) you have had with learners in school, work, or community settings. Reflecting on the insights that you have gained; how can you contribute to supporting and teaching students in school? How does this relate to what you can bring to the teaching profession? (maximum 500 words)\n\nQuestion: Describe a challenging situation you had with a learner or group of learners during one of the experiences mentioned in Question 1 above. How did the challenging situation impact the learner(s)? What did you learn about teaching and learning from this specific situation? (maximum 500 words)\n\nQuestion: Describe an experience that deepened your understanding of equity and social justice (you may wish to reference your own identities). How might this knowledge enable you to support the growth and success of diverse classrooms, schools, communities and/or learners? (maximum 500 words)\n\nApplicants who identify as Black my choose to indicate this on their application which will direct your application into the Black Future Educator's Pathway (BFEP). BFEP applicants will follow the same admissions requirements listed on this page. There are no additional application requirements for BFEP. Learn more about the Black Future Educators' Pathway (BFEP).\n\nThe MT program requires two reference letters (1 professional and 1 academic). The professional reference letter should preferably be written by a person who supervised you during one of the teaching-related experiences that you described in your responses to the Faculty Questions. The academic letter should come from a University professor who has taught you in the past. If you graduated more than 3 years ago, the program will accept a second professional reference letter in its place (in this case you should direct the most suitable referee to include some comments pertaining to your intellectual abilities and potential). Full information about submitting reference letters.\n\nYou will be required to enter information for two (2) referees. Your referees will automatically receive a notification email that they have been requested to complete a reference for your application, along with instructions to submit their reference letter in the application system.\n\nIf you need to send a reminder email to your existing referees, you can do so through your applicant portal after submitting your application.\n\nThe Master of Teaching program coursework details are as follows:\n\nStudents must complete 11.0 full-course equivalents (FCEs) or 22 half courses consisting of:\n\n8.0 FCEs: 16 half courses (or equivalent) compulsory core courses; Primary/Junior and Junior/Intermediate divisions include quarter-credit courses.\n\n1.0 FCE: 2 elective courses.\n\n2.0 FCEs: 3 practice teaching courses: CTL7080H (.5 FCE), CTL7081H (.5 FCE) and CTL7090H (1.0 FCE). There is one placement per course, totalling three teaching placements.\n\nOn successful completion, students receive the MT degree and a recommendation to the Ontario College of Teachers for an Ontario Teachers' Certificate of Qualification.\n\nAdvanced standing is not granted in this program.\n\nStudents registered in the Primary/Junior and Junior/Intermediate divisions must successfully complete the non-credit seminar course CTL7100H Mathematics Concepts for Elementary Teacher Candidates (0.0 FCE), also known as MathPlus, during their first session of registration."
