        "text": "There are a lot of differences between what happens in BC and what happens in Ontario.\n\nFor starters, parents in Ontario get a copy of what parents submit to the college when a complaint is filed by a parent.\n\nIn BC, we have to submit a Freedom of Informaiton request, and we are blocked from accessing such information. (OIPC complaint in process. I’ll keep you posted on that.)\n\nBut for now…\n\nLet us start by comparing websites.\n\nWebsite Comparison\n\nOntario Teacher’s College\n\nThey have a tab called “Public Protection” & They have a “Parents” tab\n\nUnder Public Protection, you can see that they easily have a tab for professional standards.\n\nThey also have their accessibility policies easy to access.\n\nEasy to find the annual reports listed in the tab below.\n\nBC Teacher’s Regulation Branch Website\n\nNo easily accessible information for parents. I feel that their website is a maze of information and you just have to move through everything. This is not accessible to various groups of people.\n\nI cannot find anything about accessibility policies or any kind of commitment to anti-oppression, equity, diversity and inclusion. If it’s there, I don’t know where. And here is a game to play. Who can find the annual reports? I know where they are, so I know how hard it is to find them. Let’s see if you can find them?\n\nLet’s look at their website and if you were a parent, how would you find out about information regarding this process and what you would need to file a complaint.\n\nThis is the main page that you start off looking at.\n\nUnder the Information about teaching in British Columbia, you can click on the 3rd item where it says “Read the standards of the Teaching profession”. Which in my mind, looks like an area for teachers.\n\nThen the “Make a complaint or report about a certified teacher” will bring you to Commissioner page. (This has recently been redesigned)\n\nYou then need to lick on Make a Teacher Complaint.\n\nOr, you can click on the Discipline Outcomes.\n\nYou reach this area.\n\nThen you need to click on the find out more about the discipline process.\n\nThis has recently changed since January 8th, 2024.\n\nThen you need to click on Make a Teacher Complaint. This is the first page that says the word “parent”.\n\nIt used to look like this.\n\nThey have two paths to find the teacher standards.\n\nOne way, is through the discipline outcome page. To find the teacher standards document to know if they have even broken one in order to file a complaint, you need go back to this page.\n\nAnd click on “read about the standards for educators”\n\nAnd then search on this page.\n\nAnd then click on “BC Educator Standards” to be brought to this page.\n\nTo yet, then need to continue to click on another link, the standards for certificate of qualification.\n\nTo then know to click on the first link to be finally be brought to the PDF standards document.\n\nSeriously, they couldn’t make it any harder if they tried.\n\nYou need to be willing and able to spend hours just going through the maze and reading everything.\n\nOR the second way is to click on Make a Teacher Complaint and find the link in the second paragraph. Then you will still be brought back to the other pages as I showed above.\n\nSo, this is the page that explicitly says who can file a complaint and info intended for parents.\n\nSo now, who was able to find the annual reports?\n\nYou have to go back to MEET THE COMMISSIONER and scroll all the way down to the bottom on that page.\n\nYou literally just have to spend hours clicking on all of the links, because just by hovering over the tabs it doesn’t indicate to you what the other tabs are inside. So…grab some coffee and hunker down.\n\nIT IS A MAZE!\n\nNow, let’s look at other differences.\n\nOntario Teacher’s College and why they exist. What pops out to me is the focus on public interest.\n\nTeachers Regulation Branch\n\nI have no idea where their mandate or goals, or guiding principles are located.\n\nIs it this?\n\nIs this it?\n\nTo anyone in the Minstry of Education, can you please redo your website (again) and make it more accessible for parents to access information?\n\nClearly, not in the public interest.\n\nThank you."
