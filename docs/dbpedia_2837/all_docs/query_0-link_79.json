        "text": "The Canadian Centre for Education Statistics provides the latest information on education, training and learning by bringing together data, tools and reports.\n\nThis data portal offers access to a centralized collection of information on learners and the systems that support learning in Canada. These data are available thanks to the participation of Canadians in our surveys and our partnerships with provincial and territorial education authorities and organizations.\n\nThe transition from school to work\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training: A regional analysis and international perspective. Over the course of the pandemic, measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 posed unprecedented disruptions for youth aged 15 to 29 with the shift to virtual learning, loss of employment opportunities and the decline of mental health and wellbeing.\n\nThe Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform (ELMLP) is a platform of securely integrated anonymized datasets which are longitudinal and accessible for research and statistical purposes.\n\nThe Platform enables analysis of anonymized data on past cohorts of college/university students and registered apprentices, in order to better understand their pathways and how their education and training affected their career prospects in term of earnings.\n\nIntegrated datasets allow us to know more than what a single dataset or survey can provide. Datasets are integrated using an anonymous linkage key.\n\nThe data available within the Platform is also linkable longitudinally, allowing researchers to better understand the behaviours and outcomes of students and apprentices over time.\n\nFor more information, consult the Overview of the Education and Labour Market Longitudinal Platform and Associated Datasets and the ELMLP Technical Reference Guides, or browse findings available on the Statistics Canada website, including information on student pathways through postsecondary education, labour market outcomes for college and university graduates, earnings and mobility indicators for newly certified journeypersons in Canada, and pathways indicators for registered apprentices in Canada."
