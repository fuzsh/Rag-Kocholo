        "text": "This is the ﬁrst of a four-part history of Ontario public elementary teachers and their federations.\n\nWe will learn about ETFO and its predecessor organizations, the challenges they faced and the victories they achieved. We will learn that:\n\nFederations work steadfastly to promote and protect the interests of their members\n\nFederations were and continue to be leaders in advocating for the rights of teachers and the broader society\n\nFunding for elementary education has been an issue since the 1800s\n\nLegal or collective agreement rights are never completely secure; the Federation and its members have had to be vigilant in keeping elementary education issues in the public eye and on the government agenda.\n\nThis overview captures some of ETFO’s more public achievements during the last eight years. ETFO also performs a great deal of work on behalf of members through professional relations services, equity and women’s services, professional development, public relations, communications, collective bargaining, research, leadership development, and much more. There is outreach to equality-seeking groups, to community, labour, and social justice groups, in addition to the work ETFO does on the international scene. I will highlight some of that work in future installments. I will go back in history but will not leave ETFO behind: past issues remain relevant and ETFO continues to address them today.\n\n1998 – what a year to be born as a federation! It was the year of “the big ice storm” in Eastern Ontario and Quebec. Google was founded and Sesame Street turned 30. It was the year Swissair flight 111 crashed off Peggy’s Cove in Nova Scotia. Air Canada pilots went on strike for the first time in the company’s history. The Calgary Stampeders won the Grey Cup and the New York Yankees won the World Series. Bill Clinton was president of the USA. Jean Chrétien was the prime minister of Canada and Joe Clarke had been elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Par ty of Canada again. Mike Harris was premier of Ontario. And the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (ETFO) began.\n\nThe Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario was created by the amalgamation of two predecessor organizations, the Federation of Women Teachers’ Associations of Ontario (FWTAO) and the Ontario Public School Teachers’ Federation (OPSTF). When ETFO began operating as a federation on July 1, 1998, it continued the work of two federations that had worked to promote and protect the interests of public school educators for 80 years.\n\nThe year 1998 was a time of massive change in Ontario education. The provincial government forced Ontario’s 129 school boards to merge into to 72 organizations, 31 of them public boards. Some of these new boards were huge, covering, in one instance, an area the size of France.\n\nNew funding arrangements meant boards could no longer raise money from their local tax base. Teachers were brought under the OntarioLabour RelationsAct. Occasional teachers became members of teacher federations but principals and vice-principals were removed. Thousands of veteran teachers and administrators took advantage of a new opportunity – the 85 factor – for early retirement. Added to this was a new curriculum (with no resources for implementation), new report cards (with none of the technical support needed to produce them), and the threat of ongoing teacher testing.\n\nThese were not ideal conditions in which to launch a new federation but elementary teachers proved once again they were up to the challenge.\n\nThe critical first year…\n\nA hectic year of activity followed ETFO’s inaugural Annual Meeting in 1998.\n\nIn collective bargaining the Federation and the newly conﬁgured school boards had to rec- oncile old agreements – sometimes six or more agreements had to become one. Many of the beneﬁts teachers enjoyed were removed from the EducationAct and had to be renegotiated. School boards, crying poverty in the face of the new funding formula, were eager to strip hard-won clauses on working conditions, stafﬁng, and ben- eﬁts. Their idea of reconciling salary grids was moving to the lowest wage.\n\nIt took tough bargaining, determined members, more than 20 takeovers, and three strikes (including one lockout), but ETFO locals prevailed. Salaries were reconciled up and working conditions preserved; in both cases some mod- est improvements were made. One local even managed to reinstate a retirement beneﬁt lost in 1979.\n\nBut bargaining wasn’t all ETFO did that ﬁrst year. The programs and services that the two federations had offered also had to be merged. Education and training programs offered in that ﬁrst year included a training program for local leaders, summer curriculum courses, professional growth workshops, and credit courses.\n\nCurriculum Connections and Presenters on the Road were launched.\n\nThere were workshops for Aboriginal and racial minority women members, and leadership, employment equity, and collective bargaining training for women. New curriculum resources were created, including the nationally acclaimed anti-bias cur- riculum, We’reErasingPrejudicefor Good.\n\nETFO consulted members from equality-seeking groups to see how the organization could meet their needs. It created a program to welcome new members and made presentations to future members at the faculties of education. To keep in touch with its members ETFO launched a new website and created Voice magazine, which was mailed to each member’s home. Information packages sent to stewards at every school included the newsletters Link and Women’sIssues.\n\nETFO responded to government initiatives, presented position papers, lobbied the government, and developed relationships with the broader labour and social justice communities. And ETFO also provided advice and assistance to hundreds of individual members. Not bad for a ﬁrst year!\n\nThe 1999 spring election\n\nDelegates to the 1998 ETFO Annual Meeting voted unanimously to work to defeat the Mike Harris government and to elect MPPs who would promote high-quality public education. During the provincial election held in June, ETFO worked with other teacher federations, unions, and community groups to raise the proﬁle of public education. ETFO produced billboards, leaﬂets, radio ads, and co-sponsored TV advertising. The provincial organization and many locals released members to work in Liberal and NDP campaigns. Mike Harris’s government was re-elected, but 17 Conservative incumbents lost their seats. These included three cabinet ministers, one of them former Education Minister David Johnson.\n\nTeacher testing\n\nWhen the government threatened to force teach- ers into a cyclical testing program to maintain their certiﬁcation, ETFO took control of the issue, and, before any details were announced, released EnsuringProfessionalStandardsinOntarioEducation:AResponsetotheTeacherTestingProposal.The document showed that teacher testing failed to assess teacher competency, wasted taxpayer’s money, and had no precedent in Canada or the US. ETFO proposed alternatives that would ben- eﬁt the education system, students and teachers.\n\nThe paper called for:\n\nEnhanced, government-supported teacher professional development\n\nDevelopment of a provincial model for teacher evaluation and professional growth, in partnership with education stakeholders\n\nCreation of a mentoring program for new teachers.\n\nFunding for elementary education\n\nWhen the 2000-2001 grants provided additional funding for secondary programs but no new money for the elementary panel, ETFO responded. OutofFocus:HowStudent-FocusedFundingUndervaluesElementaryEducation detailed how each grant shortchanged elementary students. As a direct result of ETFO’s actions, the next provincial budget included additional money for the reduction of primary class sizes, $70 million in special education funding for junior kindergarten and primary students, and an additional $70 million for early-years reading initiatives.\n\nKeeping extra-curricular activities voluntary\n\nOther problems were also brewing. The EducationAct increased the course load of secondary teachers and, as a result, many refused to volunteer for extra-curricular activities. Bill 74, the EducationAccountabilityAct, made extra-curricular activities mandatory anytime, any place, and any day in the school year for both elementary and secondary teachers. It also denied teachers the right to bargain conditions around extra- curricular activities.\n\nETFO fought back. With our partners in the Ontario Teachers’ Federation, ETFO explored a CharterofRightsandFreedoms challenge to the bill and a complaint to the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nETFO consulted its membership. Over 99 per cent of them agreed Bill 74 represented an unwarranted intrusion into their professional role and was a direct attack on collective bargaining rights. With this strong mandate ETFO advised teachers not to take on extra-curricular activities during the 2000-2001 school year.\n\nKeeping extra-curricular activities voluntary became one of ETFO’s bargaining goals. ETFO’s public relations campaign, No More Bullying, included radio spots, newspaper ads, and a special website that allowed members to fax their MPPs and put on the record their opposition to both Bill 74 and the recertiﬁcation scheme. At the height of the campaign, the website attracted over 1,000 visitors a day, more than ﬁve times the normal trafﬁc.\n\nTeachers won. On June 12, the Minister announced she would not proclaim the part of Bill 74 that dealt with extra-curricular activities and, in the future, would deal separately with the elementary and secondary panels.\n\nBuildingpartnershipsandpresence\n\nThat summer delegates to the 2000 Annual Meeting voted overwhelmingly to join the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL), making ETFO the largest teachers’ organization in the country afﬁliated with the labour movement. ETFO recognized that participation in the labour movement would give the federation added power to advance the cause of public education, high-quality public services, and the rights of workers.\n\nCapitalizing on the success of the ETFO media campaigns, delegates also voted to establish a provincial political action/public relations fund to support activities to reclaim the education agenda, forge alliances with parents and the public, and protect and improve the working conditions of teachers and the learning conditions of students.\n\nProtecting teachers as professionals\n\nOn June 12, under the guise of improving education and ensuring teacher competency, the government ﬁnally unveiled its teacher recertiﬁcation plan. Bill 80, the StabilityandExcellence inEducationAct,2001, required members of the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) to participate in a ﬁve-year recertiﬁcation cycle during which they would have to successfully complete 14 professional development courses. The prescribed set of courses gave teachers little ﬂexibility. It did not take into account students’ learning needs, teachers’ own professional development goals, or what stage they were at in their careers.\n\nThe OCT would administer this Professional Learning Plan (PLP) and would randomly select the ﬁrst cohort of 40,000 practising teachers who would start their ﬁve-year cycle in September 2001. Those remaining would start the following year. Fighting recertiﬁcation was a challenge for teachers because many members of the public believed it would create greater accountability.\n\nETFO had to show that this was a myth: teachers were taking part in professional development; accountability mechanisms such as performance appraisal were already in place; and the Federation had a credible alternative plan. ETFO needed to educate members to ensure their sup- port for strong and united action, and also win the support of parents and politicians.\n\nETFO’s campaign – AccountabilityYES/RecertiﬁcationNO – was a call to members to boycott the PLP plan while continuing to engage in and document their professional growth activities. It continued for three years and involved every service area, provincial and local leaders, and each individual member.\n\nThe campaign was a prime example of a multi-pronged approach to defeat a government initiative: legal action, data gathering to put an elementary face on the issue, swift consultation with members to get their support for action, partnerships with other stakeholders to strengthen the opposition, a media campaign that told the real story behind the legislation, and extensive public and private lobbying with government representatives.\n\nThe results were outstanding. Fewer than 14 percent of teachers complied with the PLP. But the government didn’t budge. It was clear that winning this ﬁght would require a change of government.\n\nFair funding – A member priority\n\nGovernment underfunding of education was widely criticized: teacher federations, school boards, and parents all spoke out. In the spring of 2002, the government appointed Mordechai Rozanski to head the Education Equality Task Force which would review the funding model. ETFO told the Task Force what members had said: class sizes were too large and supports too few, specialist teachers and programs were lost, special education was in crisis, workloads had increased, and the difference in per capita funding for elementary and secondary students was not only unfair but illogical.\n\nThe Task Force reported in December and conﬁrmed that public education in Ontario needed an infusion of $2 billion. The government quickly announced more funding for salary benchmarks, somewhat easing the 2002-2003 collective agreement negotiations.\n\nDespite the extra money, boards were still under extreme ﬁnancial pressure. Three public boards – Ottawa-Carleton, Hamilton-Wentworth, and Toronto – refused to make the spending cuts required to achieve a balanced budget. The government response was swift and brutal: they stripped these boards of their powers and appointed supervisors to oversee them.\n\nIn the spring ETFO launched FairFunding forPublicEducation with a full public relations campaign based on the message Restorefunding. Restore programs.Restore democracy. The speciﬁc plea to the public was Helpushelpyour kids. Though Toronto, Hamilton-Wentworth and Ottawa-Carleton were targeted, the campaign rolled out across the province prior to the anticipated provincial election.\n\nKeeping in touch with members\n\nFrom its inception ETFO reached out to members, checking on their attitudes to and their knowledge of their union. Did they read ETFO publications? Were they satisﬁed with ETFO programs? The responses were overwhelmingly positive.\n\nFor several years ETFO also gathered informa- tion through school-based surveys completed by ETFO stewards. These responses told the real story of the impact of funding cuts – bigger classes, heavier workloads, more paperwork, fewer programs, and crumbling schools.\n\nAt the same time, ETFO professional relations staff detected some alarming new trends – more teachers under review; more stress-related LTD claims; increased workloads due to the loss of administrators, support personnel, and specialist teachers; lack of supply teachers to cover absences; inadequate training and supports for teachers in new positions.\n\nETFO distributed this information widely. More importantly, however, the Federation was able to develop strategies to address the issues members identiﬁed.\n\nAnalyzing the landscape – 2003\n\nFor four years ETFO worked with parents, the public, its locals, and opposition parties to make education a major focus of the next election campaign. Both the Liberals and the NDP gave ETFO written commitments that they would rescind the recertiﬁcation legislation and reform the OCT to make it a truly self-governing body. Both parties adopted the ETFO class size policy. All ETFO collective agreements were due to expire on August 31, 2004, creating both challenges and opportunities for the organization. Workload was a major issue – teachers were seeking improvements and boards wanted to strip workload provisions from agreements.\n\nThe funding formula was also a problem.\n\nAlthough the EducationAct provided for an average of 200 minutes of preparation time for elementary teachers, the formula only funded 137 minutes. There were no provisions for special programs, lunchroom supervisors, or other supports necessary to run an effective school.\n\nAll of these factors converged to lead to the launch of BuildingforTomorrow.\n\nBuilding for Tomorrow\n\nDelegates to the 2003 Annual Meeting approved a multi-year initiative to enhance bargaining and revitalize the organization. BuildingforTomorrow included hiring additional bargaining staff; additional training for local negotiating teams, stewards, and members; a public relations campaign; and putting in place enhanced technology to support bargaining.\n\nElection 2003\n\nWhen the Liberal party won the October 2 election it promised to bring peace and stability to the education system. It pledged to treat teachers with respect, to form a genuine partnership with education groups, to inject more money into the system, to do away with PLP, to make the OCT truly self-governing, and to reduce primary class size.\n\nDuring its ﬁrst ﬁve years ETFO proved that it could advance and protect the interests of members, negotiate sound collective agreements, mobilize against regressive legislation, provide professional development, train new leaders, advance social justice, partner with other unions and education stakeholders, and win the support of parents and the public. And it did all this in the face of a hostile government.\n\nNow ETFO would demonstrate that it could work co-operatively with government while maintaining an unwavering commitment to its members and the issues that mattered to them.\n\nCampaign 200 – the campaign for more preparation time\n\nCampaign 200 – Planning Today, Building forTomorrow, the ﬁrst public manifestation of ETFO’s multi-year plan, was unveiled in February 2004. With a government committed to reducing the size of primary classes, ETFO could concentrate on other member issues. Its bargaining priorities for teachers and ESP/PSP members were 200 minutes of preparation time, a cap on supervision time, real salary increases, and improved leave and beneﬁt plans. Occasional teachers’ bargaining priorities included ensuring the occasional teacher got the same timetable as the teacher being replaced and improved daily rates of pay. The demand for increased preparation time addressed workload issues but it also meant more programs and more specialist teachers.\n\nOn June 2, all ETFO locals signed takeover agreements making the provincial organization their bargaining agent. Bargaining began in earnest in the fall of 2004. During the winter teachers voted overwhelmingly in favour of going on strike to back their bargaining demands.\n\nETFO forges a new approach to bargaining\n\nETFO’s bargaining goals had a hefty price tag and paying for them would require a funding commitment from the province. ETFO took advantage of the Minister’s invitation to teacher unions to explore the feasibility of establishing a provincial framework for negotiations. For four months the Federation worked with the minister and with the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association to develop a provincial framework for salary, preparation time, and supervision time issues. Agreement was reached in April. The four-year accord included 200 minutes of preparation time by 2008, caps on supervision time, and a 10.6 per cent salary increase. The government would fund the framework. Negotiations on the framework and on local issues proceeded with each district school board.\n\nETFO paved the way for a unique form of bargaining. It secured funding from the province for common issues but negotiated local issues and the application of the framework with individual school boards. By the end of June, all teacher locals had successfully negotiated new collective agreements.\n\nThere’s no substitute …\n\nOccasional teacher bargaining followed. Occasional teacher leaders received training and another public relations campaign was unveiled to support bargaining – ThereIsNoSubstitute foraSubstituteTeacher.\n\nBy the end of the year all occasional teacher locals had collective agreements that included the bargaining demands: timetable of the teacher being replaced and gains in their daily rate, some in excess of 25 per cent, closing the gap between the highest and lowest rate signiﬁcantly. In May the Near North Occasional Teacher Local staged a three-week strike before it was able to successfully conclude an agreement. As we begin a new school year all members are covered by signed collective agreements, an historic ﬁrst.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nIn the eight years of its existence, ETFO has served its members and won the respect of the public and recognition from the government.\n\nBut elementary education is still underfunded. Elementary teachers are still overworked. School boards and administrators are still trying to undermine collective agreements. Elementary students arrive at school each fall, eager to learn. But some are hungry, some are sick, and some need resources our schools aren’t providing. So the work continues, as it has for the past 100 years."
