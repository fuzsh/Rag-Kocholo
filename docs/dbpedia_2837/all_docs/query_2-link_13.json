        "text": "The Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF) represents all of the teachers in Ontario’s publicly funded schools. Per its website, \"OTF’s primary role is advocating for the teaching profession, for its member teachers and for publicly funded education. It is OTF’s statutory duty to work explicitly and implicitly in the interest of the province’s teachers. Unlike the Affiliates, OTF does not engage in collective bargaining. However, OTF does take positions to support teachers’ ability to offer the best professional service and speaks out on issues of general education policy.\"\n\nWatch the following video which introduces the Ontario Teachers' Federation:\n\nIn accordance with the Education Act, all teachers in Ontario's publicly funded schools are members of the Ontario Teachers' Federation, as well as an OTF affiliate (â¾). The OTF affiliates are:\n\nAssociation des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO)\n\nmembers are teachers in francophone school boards (both public and Catholic)\n\nElementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO)\n\nmembers are elementary teachers in English public school boards\n\nOntario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA)\n\nmembers are teachers in English Catholic school boards\n\nOntario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF)\n\nmembers are secondary teachers in English public school boards"
