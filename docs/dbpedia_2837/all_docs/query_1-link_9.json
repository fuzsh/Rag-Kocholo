        "text": "The Ontario College of Teachers (College) is the self-regulatory professional body for the teaching profession in Ontario. Established in 1996, the College has a mandate to establish and enforce professional and ethical standards for its members, to investigate complaints involving members for professional misconduct, incompetence, and fitness to practise, and to accredit teacher education programs provided by post-secondary institutions and other bodies. The College licenses all elementary and secondary school teachers, vice-principals, principals, and academic supervisory officers in Ontario and maintains a public register of licensed members.\n\nThe Council of the Ontario College of Teachers (College) has a legislated responsibility for regulating the teaching profession in Ontario and for governing its members. Council members have a primary duty to serve and protect the public interest in carrying out this duty. The Council focuses on strategic oversight of corporate governance and risk management, with separate committees made up of non-Council members that are responsible for regulatory and statutory functions such as registration, accreditation, investigation, fitness to practise, and discipline.\n\nCouncil members also serve on three sub-committees of Council that are responsible for all corporate matters relating to the appointment of Council and committee members and the human resources and financial affairs of the College: the Selection and Nominating Subcommittee, the Finance and Audit Subcommittee, and the Human Resources Subcommittee."
