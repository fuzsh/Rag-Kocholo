However, little is known about how EMCAs learn.Objectives:The intent of this study was to explore the distribution of learning styles, preferences for major learning environment characteristics, and the associations between these two factors among the EMCA population in Ontario, Canada.Methods:Following review of the literature, a 32-item survey of learning environment characteristics was constructed to measure the respondents' preferences. Using a random number generator, 386 EMCAs were selected for participation. Each received: a) an explanatory cover letter; b) a copy of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI) questionnaire; c) a second questionnaire consisting of learning environment characteristics; and d) a stamped, return addressed envelope. Completed surveys were scored to determine the respondent's Learning Style. The LSI and Learning Environment survey results were entered into a data base and subjected to Dual Scaling analysis in order to 1) Identify the distribution of learning styles; and 2) Explore associations between styles and environmental characteristics.Results:A total of 75 completed surveys were returned, each of the four styles of learning (Converger; Diverger; Assimilator; and Accommodator) were identified in the sample. Dual Scaling analysis indicated a noteworthy association (R(jt) correlation >0.300) between learning style and 10 of the 32 environmental characteristics. The data describe the usefulness of each of the learning styles.Accommodators believed courses with a strong emphasis on practical applications and working in groups to be very useful, but were less interested in courses with a strong emphasis on theory. Assimilators felt lectures and courses with a strong emphasis on theory very useful, but were less interested in providing input into course objectives. Divergers found that a lot of verbal explanation is useful, but were less interested in working with teachers who act as coaches. Convergers believed that working with teachers who act as coaches is useful. They also preferred courses with a strong emphasis on practical applications, but were less interested in courses with a strong emphasis on theory.Conclusion:The findings in this study, provide some additional insight into the connections between learning style and elements of the learning environment, and their application may contribute to operationalizing learning theory.\n\nOsmond-Johnson, Pamela. \"Contextualizing Teacher Professionalism: Findings from a Cross-Case Analysis of Union Active Teachers.\" Alberta Journal of Educational Research 62, no. 3 (January 18, 2017): 268–87. http://dx.doi.org/10.55016/ojs/ajer.v62i3.56217.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper draws on data collected as part of a study of the discourses of teacher professionalism amongst union active teachers in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario. Interviews revealed a triad of influences on the professionalism discourses of participants: engagement in teacher associations, the larger policy environment, and teacher agency. The manner in which this triad played out in each case, however, was unique to the particular political and organizational contexts framing the spaces in which such discourses were created. Using cross-case analysis, this paper specifically highlights the complex and contextualized nature of teachers’ conceptions of professionalism, paying particular attention to the nuanced enabling and limiting conditions identified between the cases.\n\nEngel, Judith S. \"Students Questioning Students (SQS): a Technique to Invite Students' Involvement.\" Gifted Education International 5, no. 3 (September 1988): 179–85. http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/026142948800500310.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nA most successful teaching strategy has been developed in my gifted/talented classes. Students question their peers about classwork, homework problems or aspects of the lesson, instead of doing the explaining themselves. Using the Students Questioning Students method (SOS), students stimulate their class-mates to think. Since students are involved in questioning, they become more attentive listeners to other students and to me during the lesson. Often the more capable students ask questions which reflect a high level of thinking skills. The students are taught strategies for asking questions and strategies for providing positive and specific feedback to their peers. With SQS, students have a piece of the action in learning. Their personalities emerge and the process is great fun! The students report that they wished SQS were used in all their classes at The Bronx High School of Science. SQS was a segment of the American Federation of Teachers program, “Teaching Children to Think,” in the series, “Inside Your Schools,” hosted by Steve Alien and shown on national TV in February, 1986. The entire series of programs for 1985–1986 was shown in the New York City area on educational TV in May, 1986.

Our research project explored how community-based programming can be adapted and mobilized to mitigate opportunity and achievement gaps for Black, Indigenous, people of colour (BIPOC), and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The project as a case study examined an afternoon and weekend supplementary academic program called the Community School Initiative (CSI), offered from September 2020 to May 2021 to members of the Jane and Finch community in Toronto, Canada at a subsidized cost. CSI is a partnership between the non-profit organization Youth Association for Academics, Athletics, and Character Education (YAAACE) and the for-profit enterprise Spirit of Math. It delivers a structured math curriculum to students in grades two to eight aged 8 to 14 years, old supported by a team of caring adults including parents, coaches, and Ontario certified teachers. The efficacy and outcomes of the CSI was assessed through surveys with parents (n=33), students (n=33), and teachers (n=4), and a focus group with seven teachers delivering the curriculum in the CSI. We also discuss the significance of how the research was conducted in the wake of COVID-19. Hence, this article is about the findings from the data, but just as much about the community-driven approach to how the research was conducted, by the community and for the community.\n\nCAVANAGH, SHEILA L. \"The Gender of Professionalism and Occupational Closure: The management of tenure-related disputes by the 'Federation of Women Teachers' Associations of Ontario' 1918-1949.\" Gender and Education 15, no. 1 (March 2003): 39–57. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0954025032000042130.\n\nFull text\n\nReid, Steven. \"Knowledge influencers: leaders influencing knowledge creation and mobilization.\" Journal of Educational Administration 52, no. 3 (April 29, 2014): 332–57. http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jea-01-2013-0013.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nPurpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of leaders on knowledge creation and mobilization. Design/methodology/approach – This mixed methods study included three high-performing districts based on provincial assessment results and socio-economic factors. Interviews and questionnaires were used to gather data from 53 participants including: 11 principals, 11 teacher leaders, 26 teachers, and five system leaders. Findings – The findings of the study emphasized the importance of leaders supporting knowledge creation and mobilization processes through practices such as engaging school-based knowledge influencers and fostering cultures of trust and risk taking. The author defined knowledge influencers as leaders, formal or informal, who have access to knowledge creating groups at the local and system level. These leaders influenced knowledge mobilization at different levels of the district. Research limitations/implications – A research limitation of this study was present based on the sole use of high-performing districts and schools. Participation was determined via comparisons of provincial assessment results (Ontario, Canada) and socio-economic status (SES) factors. Although causal effects are cautioned, districts and schools from various SES communities (high, medium, low) were chosen to support broad generalizations and associations. Practical implications – This study provided pragmatic considerations and recommendations for system and school leaders, those charged with increasing student achievement (e.g. use of knowledge influencers and an expanded array of data use while creating knowledge). Originality/value – A knowledge creation model was developed by the author based on a synthesis of the findings. The model and study will be of interest to those wishing to further implement or study the creation and mobilization of knowledge within organizations.\n\nNurse, Kimberly, Magdalena Janus, Catherine Birken, Charles Keown-Stoneman, Jessica Omand, Jonathon Maguire, Caroline Reid-Westoby, et al. \"38 Developmental Screening Using the Infant Toddler Checklist at 18 Months and School Readiness at 4 to 6 Years.\" Paediatrics & Child Health 27, Supplement_3 (October 1, 2022): e19-e19. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxac100.037.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract Background The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental screening at multiple visits using both a general developmental tool and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific tool. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends screening at a single visit at 18 months. There is no consensus on which tool is best suited for one-time screening. The Infant Toddler Checklist (ITC) identifies children who are at risk for communication impairment, may detect ASD, and may be a useful screening tool at the 18-month visit. Objectives To examine the screening test accuracy of the ITC at the 18-month visit to predict school readiness at kindergarten age. Design/Methods This prospective cohort study included children who attended primary care health supervision visits in Toronto, Canada. Parents completed the ITC at the 18-month visit and teachers completed the Early Development Instrument (EDI - a population-level measure of school readiness in kindergarten) at 4-6 years. An ITC screen is positive if there is concern for expressive speech delay (speech composite below the 10th percentile) and/or other communication delay (social composite, symbolic composite or the total score below the 10th percentile). Children were considered overall vulnerable on the EDI if at least one of five domains was below the 10th percentile of the Ontario population: language and cognitive development; physical health and well-being; social competence; emotional maturity; communication skills and general knowledge. We calculated screening test properties with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using EDI vulnerability as the criterion measure. We used multivariable regression models to examine the association between the ITC and EDI domains. Results Of 293 children, 30 (10%) had a positive ITC. At follow-up, 54 (18%) children had a teacher-reported EDI vulnerability. The specificity (range, 87%-96%) and negative predictive value (range, 83%-95%) for the ITC were high; false positive rate was low (range, 4%-13%); sensitivity was low (range, 11%-37%). A positive ITC was associated with a lower score in EDI language and cognitive development (b= -0.62, 95% CI: -1.25, -0.18; P=0.046) and EDI communication skills and general knowledge (b= -1.08, 95% CI: -2.10, -0.17; P=0.036). We found no evidence of an association between ITC and EDI vulnerability. Conclusion The ITC at 18 months had high specificity (87%-96%) suggesting that most children with a negative ITC will demonstrate school readiness at 4-6 years. False positive rates were low, minimizing over-diagnosis. The ITC, with its focus on speech and language, communication disorders and ASD, may be a candidate for screening at the 18-month visit.\n\nCavanagh, Sheila L. \"Professionalism as a legislated code of moral conduct the government of the woman teacher in education, Ontario, 1918-1949 /.\" Thesis, National Library of Canada = Bibliothèque nationale du Canada, 1999. http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk1/tape10/PQDD_0011/NQ39258.pdf.\n\nFull text\n\nDixon, Robert Thomas.
