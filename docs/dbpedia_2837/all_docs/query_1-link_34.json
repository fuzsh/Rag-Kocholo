This mode of delivery allows for immediate feedback and direct engagement between the participants and the instructor, fostering a collaborative and dynamic learning experience. In-person delivery is often considered more personal and interactive than remote or online delivery methods and provides opportunities for hands-on activities, group discussions, and other forms of interaction.\n\nFAQs\n\nStudents that complete all the requirements of this program may be eligible for a three-year Post-Graduate Work Permit, but the final decision is determined by Immigration, Refugees, Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nAs of March 19, 2024, spouses/partners of ITT students are no longer eligible for a SOWP.\n\nYes. You can do it here: Applicant Eligibility Assessment | Ontario College of Teachers (oct.ca). Remember, the self-assessment only gives you a general idea of your eligibility for the OCT certification. It is strongly recommended that you apply to OCT first. You maybe eligible for OCT without any conditions. If not, they will give you detailed recommendations as to the additional work for you to acquire OCT registration.\n\nYes, but please make sure you select the correct receiver, PS Queens. This applies to IELTS results only.\n\nYes. English is the primary language of instruction and communication at the ITT program and Queen’s University. Applicants must demonstrate an adequate level of proficiency in English, regardless of their citizenship status or country of origin. However, knowing French will be an asset when it comes to finding teaching jobs in Ontario.\n\nNo. Montessori follows an independent approach, and their program does not meet the OCT’s registration requirements. We recommend that candidates with Montessori background apply to OCT first and then apply to our program with proof of OCT eligibility.\n\nThe OCT accepts distance education programs, if they included a face-to-face practicum. We recommend that candidates with degrees completed online apply to the OCT first and then apply to our program with proof of OCT eligibility.\n\nPlease refer to Country Specific Information on OCT website to see if you need to provide teaching qualifications during the time of application. If the answer is yes, you must submit active teaching qualifications. Those qualifications should be verifiable when needed.\n\nNo, but it will enhance your application and help us plan the practicum component in the ITT program.\n\nWhile Queen’s University will work diligently to provide you with information and training within the ITT Program to support your journey towards Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) certification, we cannot guarantee that you will attain OCT certification upon completion of the program. Obtaining OCT certification is dependent on various factors, including meeting the OCT's requirements, completing necessary assessments, and fulfilling any additional conditions that may be attached to your application. Queen’s is committed to assisting you throughout this process, but the ultimate decision regarding certification rests with the OCT. We encourage you to actively engage in the program, seek guidance from faculty and advisors, and diligently fulfill all requirements to enhance your chances of achieving OCT certification.\n\nIf the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) attaches specific conditions to your application, it typically means that they have identified areas where additional qualifications or coursework are needed for you to become certified as a teacher. This may involve completing additional undergraduate coursework or undertaking additional Additional Qualification (AQ) programs. These additional requirements could incur extra costs outside the Internationally Trained Teachers (ITT) Program. Furthermore, you may find yourself needing to teach a different age group than the one you are currently qualified for.\n\nPolicies and More Information\n\nProfessional Studies Program Policies\n\nFees, Refunds and Financial Support"
