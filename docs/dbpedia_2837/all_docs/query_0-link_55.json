        "text": "Start your new adventure teaching English to second-language learners.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nCELTA, TESL Canada and TESL Ontario: three certifications, one program\n\nWhat’s the “Plus” in TESOL Plus? In one program, you’ll be able to earn three certifications — CELTA, TESL Canada and TESL Ontario. Employers look for these qualifications. If you want to teach ESL learners in Ontario, across Canada or abroad, these highly-respected certifications will qualify you to teach anywhere.\n\nTeach English abroad with CELTA certification\n\nIf you want to teach English abroad, the Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (CELTA) may be your ticket. CELTA is known around the world, and many employers ask for it by name. Sheridan is an official CELTA Centre, accredited by the University of Cambridge. You’ll get the practical training that meets Cambridge’s high CELTA standards—and be certified when you graduate.\n\nTeach in Canada with TESL Canada or Ontario with TESL Ontario\n\nTESL Ontario sets the standards for ESL teachers in the government-sponsored sector and is perfect for those who want to teach in Ontario. If you want to teach anywhere in Canada, you’ll need qualification from TESL Canada. When you successfully complete Sheridan’s program, you may apply for both your TESL Canada (Standard 2) certification and your TESL Ontario certification.\n\nTeach English while you study\n\nGet the practical skills to teach English to a range of ESL learners. In this program, you’ll observe experienced instructors, while learning current methodologies and developing your teaching skills and techniques in authentic ESL classrooms. You’ll also have a dedicated practicum course in both terms, where you may work with ESL students at Sheridan, newcomers to Canada through our Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) program or students off-campus.\n\nIn your first term practicum, you’ll have an instructor for a maximum of 6 students, and in your second term practicum, you’ll have a mentor to guide and support you throughout your teaching.\n\nBuild an e-portfolio and gain PBLA (Portfolio-based Language Assessment) instruction\n\nSheridan's TESOL Plus program gives you the opportunity to create an electronic portfolio containing your assignments, lesson plans and other resources. You will also receive valuable instruction in PBLA, key content for school board and LINC employment which can put you ahead of the game for employment in all sectors. Upon graduation, you can show your e-portfolio, complete with PBLA content, to potential employers to highlight your skills and make yourself more marketable."
