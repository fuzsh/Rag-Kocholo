The Ontario College of Teachers licenses, governs and regulates Ontarioâ€™s teaching profession in the public interest. It was created by the Ontario College of Teachers Act to:

issue, suspend and revoke teaching certificates

set ethical standards and standards of practice

investigate and hear concerns and complaints about members

accredit teacher education programs and courses.

All publicly funded school teachers and administrators in Ontario must be certified by us and be members of the College.

Our Council

A 12-person Council, comprised of six Ontario Certified Teachers and six members of the public, governs the College. Council is responsible for setting the strategic objectives of the College in order to achieve its statutory mandate.

College Council, statutory committees, regulatory committees, and rosters of panellists were established through a competency-based selection process.
