Norway's Mol and Sørum took revenge over Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh of the United States after losing to them in the Gstaad Elite16 final earlier this month.

They produced a comeback to take the first set 21-17 before falling to a 21-15 defeat in the second.

This set up a tiebreaker that was clinched 15-10 by the Tokyo 2020 gold medallists to clinch their third triumph on the Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour this season.

"How could we not have fun with this crowd?" said Mol.

"It was amazing here.

"The fans really pushed us hard.

"I don't know why they are cheering so much for Norway here, in Canada, but we love it!

"We really played a great game today, but so did they.

"So we had to push really hard.

"They make us be better beach volleyball players and that's good for the sport.

"We just have to thank the Americans for a great game."

Alex Ranghieri and Adam Carambula of Italy got the better of Brazilians Evandro Oliveira and Arthur Mariano 24-22, 22-20 in a thrilling bronze-medal match to make up the podium.

Humana-Paredes and Wilkerson delighted the home crowd with a second gold on the Tour this year.

They combined to beat Betsi Flint and Julia Scoles 21-15, 16-21, 15-13 and subject the US to another silver medal.

"This one will be in my memories forever," said Wilkerson.

"This is our first Elite16 gold together as a team, in front of a Canadian crowd with this much energy, this much love.

"This was the first time my family got to watch me play live, so there were a lot of firsts here; you couldn’t have written it up any better.

"It was a tough win.

"We had to battle in every single moment and it was beautiful!

"People are here at the Elite16 for a reason.

"It's a gold medal match for a reason.

"It's never going to be easy, but we stepped up and we proved ourselves."

Bronze went the way of China's Xue Chen and Xia Xinyi who narrowly prevailed 21-17, 20-22, 15-12 against The Netherlands Katja Stam and Raisa Schoon.
