More or less are you “hands on” with your sound in the live setting?\n\nMatt: Pretty hands on, my tech knows what I like he’s very good\n\nJoão: Matt, what are you listening to lately? what bands ?Foo Fighters…do you enjoy ?\n\nMatt: Not much Foo Fighters , Queens of The Stone Age , Killers !\n\nVictoria: Hi Matt! wich was youe best show and why? or wixh show did you most enjoy? thanks and kisses from Argentina!\n\nMatt: So many great shows I can’t really say Rock n Rio Was a highlight\n\nMike: Do you ever see Izzy? He’s gotta be the most “incognito” ex-gunner. I like some of his solo stuff, though. Any speculation as to why he never stayed on in VR? Him and duff could handle vocals, IMO… Plus the riffs him and slash make- “Ghost” was a shining example.\n\nMatt: We worked with him on a bunch of songs but he just has always done his own thing\n\nAbigail: Hi Matt! I was wondering, what did you think of Axl when you first met? How was his attitude and character? Did you like being in Guns N’ Roses?\n\nMatt: He was cool to me\n\nI think you are one of the greatest drummers of all time, and I love all of your work!\n\nMatt: Thanks!\n\nTJ: Matt what are the chances of ever seeing you in Telluride? Ohh man just think of it thunder off the mountians of gold!! I can hear it now. You friend TJ\n\nMatt: Man beautiful place would love that\n\nMartin Hudson: have you listened to a song of Chinese Democracy? which one?\n\nMatt: No I havent\n\nDarryl Rowell: Second question–yeah I’m greedy– excluding your own- who’s snare sound do you just “love?”\n\nMatt: Always like Phil Rudd and Alex Van Halen\n\nNelson: Hi matt! apology brand of gloves used to play drums in the era of guns n ‘roses greetings!!\n\nMatt: When I wore gloves they were Easton\n\nSayma: you can speak Spanish? Slash how often you see? and as you go with your career? (:\n\nMatt: Poquito, I see Slash all the time and things are good\n\nSayma: OMG!! this is good!! Good Luck!! and God Bless ^^ You think they ever come to Mexico and may have a meet and greet and please tell him I admire Slash too and I would like to have some of the for me (:\n\nMatt: Cool let’s do it\n\nNelson: Hi matt! apology brand of gloves used to play drums in the era of guns n ‘roses greetings!!!\n\nMatt: Easton gloves\n\nNelson: Hi matt! apology brand of gloves used to play drums in the era of guns n ‘roses greetings!\n\nMatt: I played with Easton gloves\n\nJack Graham: Hey Matt (second question aha), I’m currently trying to record a few songs in my room where I play every instrument, considering sending the finished three or four songs to a record label, any suggestions musically or otherwise?\n\nMatt: Do exactly what you feel don’t try to force it, make sure your songs are great\n\nThere are less record deals than before\n\nPekka: Are there possibly any rehearsal recordings from 95-96 where Slash is on lead guitar and Axl on rhythm guitar? I suspect all songs/recordings from those days are in “GNR vaults”?\n\nMatt: That’s correct everything was on adats\n\nJake Howe: Whatever happened to Camp Freddy radio?\n\nMatt: The station went off the air after we were on for 6 years so did Jonesy jukebox which was great\n\nDave: Hi Matt, What is the deal with Velvet Revolver? are we ever going to see you guys recording again? I was at on of the last shows before the break up in Dublin and it was one of the best gigs I’ve ever been to. Thanks\n\nDave\n\nMatt: I certainly hope so\n\nStradlin: you didnt receibe any calls for an guns n roses reunion?\n\nMatt: Youre funny\n\nLaura Reed: Hey Matt when is Cherri Currie’s cd coming out that you produced ?\n\nMatt: In the next few months I hope\n\nGBondarenko: Hi Matt, when you come to Brazil?\n\nMatt: Soon I hope maybe in April\n\nBrett: Hey matt! any tips for a me towards drumming? And by the way are you going to make a record?\n\nMatt: Practice to great records and develop your own style\n\nFazyl: Hi Matt! I am a guitar player. GnR have influenced me very much. Indeed, it is one of my all time favorite bands. Since I am hugely influenced by you guys, my dream is to get your feedbacks on my music. Can you listen to one of my songs please please please and give a feedback? Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFxKucES9Gk\n\nMatt: Cool I listened good ideas I think you could tighten up the arrangement. Maybe a better chorus remember the chorus has to be the hook or the payoff of the song. Seems like to much verse at the top. Simplify a bit including the solo bring some more melody like Slash would do. And the Vocal is a little loud. Send again\n\nJoanna: Hey Matt (2nd question, I’m a big fan) If you couldn’t play the drums what other instrument would you like to play?\n\nMatt: I play guitar, bass and keyboards\n\nTrond Erik Vee Aune: Duff has also said he’ll attend HOF and Steven couldn’t be dragged away from the HOF by seven wild horses. So that makes three of you. Since you talk to Slash all the time, will he attend? Are you worried that old guns being inducted will take focus away from all the great stuff that current guns is doing?\n\nMatt: Not sure what’s happening with Slash yet, not worried about it\n\nJulio Freitas: Matt, if you had to make a dream today, what would it be? could share with us?\n\nMatt: Living on the beach next door to Sammy Hagar in Cabo\n\nPekka: Thank you for answering my questions! I’ve been wondering some of this stuff for 15 years. Was Axl playing rhythm guitar also during 1997 GNR rehearsals?\n\nMatt: Yes Axl was playing guitar and having a lot of fun doing it\n\nTrond Erik Vee Aune: As the “new guy” in the band, why didn’t you confront Axl with showing up late for gigs in the 90′s?\n\nMatt: I did\n\nPablo: Matt gives me your msn? KKKKK joke\n\nmatt you plan to go to the Hall of Fame playing with guns n roses in April?\n\nMatt: Yes inm attnding\n\nSamantha: Hi Matt!

Hugs from Bulgaria!\n\nMatt: A hat, cohiba, rings , necklace , brachlet\n\nJoe: What 3 thing would you bring with yourself if you have to stay alone in a deserted island?\n\nMatt: Haley berry and Selma Hayek and Ace Harper\n\nMatt: Really my French bulldogs Lola and Bowie and my fiancé Ace\n\nGBondarenko: How was the NAMM 2012? had many novelties?\n\nMatt: The craziest ever, lots of nutty people too\n\nZane Duffner: Have you ever played “Think About You” off of Appetite? It’s such an underrated song.\n\nMatt: I don’t think so, yes it is a good song\n\nchris Dickson: Ok Matt, another question: When regarding venues small like Kool Haus in TO or TokyoDome. Which do you feel more comfortable at? Or does it really matter ?\n\nMatt: I like playing all size venues, the big huge ones are less intimate but still a rush\n\nJay: If you had 1 “do over” during your career, what would it be?\n\nMatt: Nothing I guess , it’s all been very interesting wish we could have kept Gnr together\n\nDaniela Aguiar: How was it working alongside Duff for all these years?\n\nMatt: Duff is like a brother to me, we are still very close and always speak the truth to each other\n\nunapiba: Matt, tell me where´s Izzy.\n\nMatt: I have no idea where he is, he’s always travelling\n\nChristian: Hey Matt Have you ever considered Gilby Clarcke instead of Dave in the early VR days?\n\nMatt: No not really we were trying to do something a little different\n\nJulian: I know you came to Sydney recently for the Hard Rock how was the show?

I wish you do. Love you so much\n\nMatt: Working on something now\n\nJúlia: You can speak Portuguese? Are you excited about the Rock n ‘Roll Hall of Fame?\n\nMatt: Obrigado and tudo bein\n\nGustavo Mendieta: Don´t know if you´ve heard Chinese Democracy, but did you work on any of its songs prior to your departure from GN´R? Much respect and admiration.\n\nMatt: I think I did, not sure haven’t heard the record\n\nPedro: Is there any possibility of Rod Jackson (lead singer of the of the second lineup Slash’s Snakepit) be the new singer of Velvet Revolver? *sorry for my bad english\n\nMatt: No I don’t think so\n\nAlisson: Hi Matt!
