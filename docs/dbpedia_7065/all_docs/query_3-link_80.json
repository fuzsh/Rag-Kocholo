        "text": "Taking stock of Matt Sorum’s music career is no easy feat.\n\nThe California-born musician was part of Tori Amos’ first band, Y Kant Tori Read and went on to play drums in The Cult, Guns N’ Roses (with whom he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012), Velvet Revolver, briefly with Motorhead and others, and he’s also part of the all-star groups Camp Freddy, Kings of Chaos and the Hollywood Vampires. He’s also released a pair of solo albums and co-produced ZZ Top guitarist Billy F. Gibbons’ 2021 solo album “Hardware.”\n\nSorum, 61, writes about all this and more in a new memoir, “Double Talkin’ Jive,” just published after its original September date was postponed. It’s revealing and insightful, and, much like the man himself, plain-spoken and passionate…\n\n* Sorum says by phone from Los Angeles that the idea for “Double Talkin’ Jive” (named after a song on Guns N’ Roses’ “Use Your Illusion I” album) came from being “the token rock guy at a party where people would want to hear a story. So you’d tell a story and they’re like, ‘You should write a book!’ I heard that a lot. There were a few other times where I tried to write it earlier on, and then I got approached by these guys from Sweden, (Leif Eriksson and Martin Svensson) and I really liked their vibe. I’d just moved to Palm Springs at the time and a lot of change was happening in my life, so I had time to reflect and was like, ‘OK, why don’t you guys come out and we’ll get started.’ It was a pretty long process and it’s exciting to finally get it out.”\n\n* Sorum’s goal for the book was “just to be honest and tell my side of the story. I had to kind of shape who I am, so I wanted to write about how I did that and maybe why I ended up where I ended up. It’s my life story really. I didn’t tell some of the inner-workings of my family life, but (writing the book) helped me realize why alcohol and drugs became an important role in my life at that time. But at the same time there was this really driving force in my life to become a rock ‘n’ roll drummer. Everything I went through in my childhood drove me to go to Hollywood and become this rebellious rock ‘n’ roll guy and end up in these great rock ‘n’ roll bands.”\n\n* Sorum notes that while he’s now “an older, mature guy” he “had to take on the role of the earlier, younger guy to tell the story correctly…That was the height of shenanigans for that era of sex, drugs, rock ‘n’ roll — the kind in a candy store, smorgasbord kind of activity. I did everything I thought was supposed to do at that time. So maybe I sound a little bit adolescent, but at the time I was adolescent, so I wanted to take on that personality and make you feel like that guy is still there.”\n\n* Guns N’ Roses was the most famous of Sorum’s bands. He served from 1990-97 and his happy to see co-founders Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan back in the band together now. “We were all younger, and it was too much confusion and it was so big and everybody was pulling at everybody, and there was alcohol and too much of this, too much of that. We were never able to sit down and take it out, working it out musically or whatever. Obviously the two guys who wouldn’t work it out (Rose and Slash) are back together, probably making more money than they ever made back in the day. My only thing is what could we have done in those years, musically? There could’ve been a lot of great records — or we could’ve made a real (bad) record and the band would’ve fallen off the face of the Earth. Who knows?”\n\n* Of all the bands he’s been involved with, Sorum says his greatest regret is that Velvet Revolver — which he formed with Slash, McKagan, Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland and Wasted Youth’s Dave Kushner — only lasted for two albums, though it did win a Grammy Award in 2005 for the song “Slither.” “That was the one band I was really bummed that we couldn’t keep going. We were a fired-up, rip roarin’ rock ‘n’ roll band in the beginning. I truly thought we could keep the machine on the tracks, but we went out on the road for, like, 18 months, just kept touring, and I felt the burn factor kick in and old habits were creeping up and then I fell off the wagon and it just went downhill. I was like, ‘Aw, (expletive), not this again…'”"
