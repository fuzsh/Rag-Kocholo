        "text": "Rockers from Guns N’ Roses and Velvet Revolver to Tori Amos and Billy Gibbons have all been lucky enough to turn around and see drummer Matt Sorum behind them on stage keeping the rhythm going. I spoke with Sorum about his healing work with the Raven Drum Foundation, his early days in Hollywood and why you never want to be responsible for Charlie Sheen’s wine bill.\n\nWhat was your first drink?\n\nBeer. I had two older brothers and you know, it was the sixties. My parents got divorced and my dad was just like this wild man. He would take us camping in Death Valley and I remember getting that first beer. I think I was — God, it might've been nine.\n\nSounds like the beginnings of a Rock ’n’ Roll lifestyle.\n\nI did my first real tour when I was 19. I went down to the Deep South and we were in New Orleans (laughs) and that's when I really learned how to drink. Because you could take a glass and walk down the street and they'd fill it. And then coming back to Hollywood — the Rainbow Bar and Grill was my watering hole.\n\nWhat was the Rainbow like for someone just starting out?\n\nI came to Hollywood in 1979. Straight outta high school. And that was the place to go to just meet other musicians. There was no internet. (Laughs) We were still passing out flyers. So if you wanted to connect you had to be in the scene. There was also the Whiskey and the Roxy, so that was the hub.\n\nHow did you make the leap from the bar to the stage?\n\nBefore it was the Viper Room the place there was called The Central. There was a Tuesday jam night there and I got my first gig out of that place at 19. The drinking was all part of it. If you were cool enough to meet some guy that thought you were cool and he bought everyone drinks — that was like oh! I learned early on, way before I was ever well-known, there were music fans that wanted to hang out with you and buy you cocktails.\n\nPeople would come up and go “hey play ‘Freebird.’” And we’re like ok, if you buy us a round of kamikazes (laughs). That was the way the band got drunk. ‘Cocaine’ by Eric Clapton, Loverboy ‘Working for the Weekend’ – all those you have to pay us with cocktails!\n\nLoverboy should have been two cocktails.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nDid people you were hanging with suddenly became famous and you’re wondering when it’s going to be your turn?\n\nOh yeah. I had guys take off before I did. One of my good buddies got in Lita Ford’s band and then in Ozzy Osbourne’s band. I was still sleeping on people’s couches. Kingdom Come — I was in a band with those guys in the early ‘80s and then I went and saw them in a stadium.\n\nI didn't get in The Cult until I was 28 and in those days 28 was old! So I was getting nervous. And then I got that break.\n\nWhat was life with The Cult like?\n\nTalk about a beer-drinking band. We go to England and I’ve never traveled to Europe. Ian Asbury takes me out to this pub and we get a drink called the Snakebite. It's half beer and half cider. I drank two of those — man I was toast. Hanging in England, you know, I understood why so many English bands were great. I figured it out.\n\nAnd the secret is?\n\nWell here I am from California. You’ve got options. You can go surfing. You can go skateboarding, go ride on your bike. Take a nice walk down the beach. England — it rains all the time. (Laughs) You're indoors. You're either in a pub or you're in your house practicing your guitar and your drums. So if you look at the per capita of great music that came from such a small continent — that's my theory.\n\nMatt Sorum just solved the British Invasion.\n\nThere's no other options.\n\nWhat’s your drink of choice now?\n\nRight now I'm having a cool brew. It's so much different now. You go backstage at a concert and they’ve got yoga and green juice. I think what happens for a lot of rock bands is survival. At some point everyone’s worried about you and you know, we lose people from over-abuse. But at this point I’m in my healthy-folk phase.\n\nI tailed down and got really into wine. I love drinking nice wine. To the point where my business manager called me and he said what is this case of ’61 Chateau Latour? I won't name names but a guy who I was in a band with — his business manager was saying he was spending something like $20K a week on Château Lafite Rothschild.\n\nHow did you develop your taste for fine wine?\n\nI remember when I had my first expensive bottle of wine — it was with Charlie Sheen. He took me to Vegas to see a Tyson fight and flew us on a private jet. And I said ‘I want to repay you. Let's go to dinner.’ So we went to this place called Drai’s. And Charlie goes to the waiter ‘would you bring over that nice bottle of 1945 Rothschild I see on the menu’ — and I’m paying for dinner. I look and it’s like two grand at that time. I’m like whoa okay.\n\nI’m guessing it gets worse from there.\n\nWe drank two of those! Then he ordered a Magnum of — I think it may have been ’59 Chateau Latour or one of those. (Laughs) And that was a five grander! I’m already in for ten grand. And he keeps going. We drank two of those. I'm starting to get sweaty.\n\nWhat was the final bill?\n\nRight before the check comes Charlie leans over to me and goes “Matt, I just went to Japan and did a commercial. I made a million dollars. I got the dinner. And by the way — the wine came out of my private locker here.”\n\nYou survived a night out with Charlie Sheen — physically and financially.\n\nHe loved the band so I sent him this Guns N’ Roses pinball machine. That was my payback. I couldn't even keep up with that guy.\n\nLet’s talk about your work with the Raven Drum Foundation.\n\nMy good pal Rick Allen (Def Leppard) and his wife Lauren Monroe are amazing. We sponsor veterans, first responders, people that have been through very traumatic situations to come in and join us in a circle of drummers. The old version was kind of a hippie thing but we're using it as a therapeutic approach to connecting people and feeling the same heart rhythm. And it really is a beautiful ceremony. These people come in with us and work through things that they aren’t able to vocal vocalize and just be able to find some center.\n\nFor this next event we're going to Wyoming to a really cool ranch. A lot of great drummers are coming. Rick and his wife will be there, and I'm traveling up. I find it very impactful. We all have fears. We all have anxiety. We all have complications in our life and trauma on a daily basis. The Raven Drum Foundation is an amazing group of people. I'm really excited to go."
