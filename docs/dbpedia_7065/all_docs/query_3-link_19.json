        "text": "According to Matt, he walked out after a massive argument with Axl - about Slash. They had been talking in the studio when Paul Huge remarked he had seen Slash play with his band, the Snakepit, on the David Letterman show the previous night and that it had “sounded like shit and looked like shit.” Says Matt now: “He was just bagging on Slash. I said, 'Listen motherfucker, when I'm sitting in the room, I'd appreciate it if you don't fucking say shit about Slash. He's still my friend. You can't even hold a fucking candle to that fucking guy. He's got more talent in his little toe than you, motherfucker, shut up!' And then Axl got in my face. I said, 'You know what, Axl, man? You're fucking smoking crack if you think this band's GN'R without Slash. You're gonna go play 'Sweet Child O' Mine' with fucking Paul Huge? Sorry, dude, it ain't gonna sound right. Fucking 'Welcome to the Jungle' without Slash?' [Axl] says, 'I'm Guns N' Roses - I don't need Slash'. I said, 'You know what? No, you aren't'. We got into a big pissy match; it went onto a bunch of other bullshit for about another 20 minutes. And then he finally said, 'Well, are you gonna fucking quit?' I said, 'No, I don't fucking quit'. And then he said, 'Well, then you're fucking fired.\n\n“Paul Huge chased me out to the parking lot and said, 'What the fuck, man? Just come back in and apologise!' I said, 'Fuck you, Yoko! I'm gone!' And that was it. I went home to my fucking six-level palatial rock star estate with two elevators and my Porsche. I was producing a band called Candlebox at the time, they were living in my house. And I said, 'I just got fired'. They said, 'Ah, fuck he'll call you back', and I said, 'No, not this time'. Cos he'd fired me before but he always called me back. I said, 'No, I don't think so'. And about a month later I got the letter from the lawyers.” - MICK WALL'S BOOK\n\n- From an \"alleged\" GnR insider on Matt's firing [from a source who was actually there to witness everything firsthand]:\n\nI think most of it actually was true tho I'm not sure about the Slash on Letterman bit. I thought the Matt fight was around Jan or Feb. ? of '97. Slash had left the previous fall. Matt was in a pissy mood, he didn't want to go to the studio, it was his gf's birthday or something, but did when Axl called of course, and then Axl was just playing piano. Matt was steaming. He said something to one of the crew about expecting to get fired that day before it even happened. I think they started arguing before Paul started badmouthing Slash and it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. They all really hated Huge, Matt and Slash especially. And I think the argument went on for quite awhile, lots of shouting, before the 'are you going to quit? you're fired' bit. And Paul did follow him out to the parking lot, trying to get him to come back. Somebody told me Axl was peeking around the corner watching the whole thing. ( )\n\nI saw Matt in May (97) and he was acting like he was still in the band. He really deflated when I told him I knew what went down. He probably already had the letter by then. But that said, Doug was also still saying for months after that that Matt's participation wasn't ruled out, even while Vrenna, Abruzzese, etc, were around. With Axl, the rule is to just wait it out. Matt (and everybody else) had probably been fired a half-dozen times before. As for Matt sounding like he has a connection, they all know the people still in the loop, I'm sure Matt would have heard from a number of people that Axl wasn't happy with his Spin quotes.\n\nhttp://www.gunsnfnroses.com/index.php?/topic/5291-matt-sorums-account-of-leaving/\n\n[2001]\n\nI never thought The Cult got their full shake; I thought they should've been way more successful as a band. A lot of people were influenced by Ian a lot of people (by) his persona and his stage thing. He gave Axl his first headband. He told him to take that puffy hair and comb it straight, put that headband on. Because all those other bands in L.A. were doing it. If you watch the 'Welcome to the Jungle' video, you can see the difference in Axl's hair between that and 'Sweet Child of Mine.'\"\n\nQ: What happened with Guns N' Roses?\n\nA: \"There was so much time going by. We ended the tour in the summer of '93. Me, Slash, Gilby (Clarke, another GNR guitarist) and Duff spent some time writing some music, and Axl didn't like it. Then me and Slash went and did the Snakepit album and all this political (expletive) started happening. And years and years were going by, like three years. And I was just hanging out in Hollywood and partying. Finally, me and Duff put another band together called Neurotic Outsiders, and as soon as we did that Axl called us back into the studio. So we started rehearsing with Guns we'd show up every night and Axl would come in at like midnight and we'd rehearse until six in the morning, seven, eight o'clock in the morning. It was ridiculous. My drug use was getting out of control. Everyone was just trying to stay up because of the ridiculous hours. Then Slash didn't want to come down to rehearsal, and he and Axl were having some differences in the musical direction.\n\nIn '97 I got into a little bit of an argument with Axl about the state of the band. He'd brought in another guitar player, Paul Huge, and none of us really wanted to play with him. Axl really wanted him in the band and we didn't really want to play with the guy. Me and Duff were showing up, trying to be professional and get the work done but it just didn't seem to be going anywhere, and obviously it still hasn't. I'm so glad I left because it was just stagnant. It didn't make any sense to be a musician to be sitting there not being able to put any of your creative energy out to the world. All my stuff was on some tapes on a shelf and four years had gone by. I was still making a lot of money. The band was paying me really well, and I was a member. I was getting a big check every month and living the high-life up in a big six-level house with a Porsche and all my (expletive). One day I just said (expletive) this. I want to play you know, let's go! Me and Axl had an argument and I said, 'You should get Slash back and we should put the band back together. Get out there and do it.' He was like, 'I don't need Slash.' And I said, 'Well I think you do.' And he asked me, 'Are you gonna quit?' And I said, 'No I'm not going to quit.' And he said, 'Well you're fired.' So I left, and I remember walking out the door and I went back to my six-level palatial estate, where I was producing a band called Candlebox, they were in my house. And I said, 'I've just been fired from Guns N' Roses.' And we sat down and we celebrated.\"\n\nQ: Did you think the band had gotten sort of bloated toward the end?\n\nA: \"With all the horn players and (expletive)? That was boring, wasn't it? I wanted to kill those (expletive) girls by the end of that tour. They were in my dressing room. Behind my drum riser, I used to have my own room and I had a bar in there and I used to have little groupie chicks running around naked. Then these (expletive) girl horn players and background singers came on the tour, and they used to have to sit in my room sitting down there doing their makeup. And Axl was doing all these costume changes and I'm like, 'What happened to this (expletive) band?' So finally we all agreed to get rid of the horn players. We did a tour after that, the 'Skin and Bones' tour. That was our anti-statement to Axl: 'Let's get rid of these (expletive) horn players.' But I understood a lot of what Axl was doing. He wanted to heighten; he wanted to cross Guns over into super group. And he was very smart about the way he did it. He used to bring artists onstage with us: Elton (John), Brian May, Lenny Kravitz, Stephen Tyler and Joe Perry. And his whole thing was you are who you hang out with. To a certain degree, I think the band achieved super group status because of the strategic things that Axl always thought up. It was his thing to put out the double album very smart guy, very intelligent. At times it gets the best of him. I don't know WHAT he's thinking right now. I don't know where his head's gone, I can't get inside his head. He's created some sort of mystique for himself that's actually legendary now.\"\n\nhttp://www2.ljworld.com/news/2001/jun/28/seven_questions_with/\n\n- The decision to fire Sorum may have been on Axl's mind since late '96 when they were gearing up to release the album with Slash. The Paul Huge/Sorum showdown in March/April '97 was probably just the last straw.\n\nQuote\n\nDuff: [...] Matt was never a full member of the band, he was on an ejector seat and Axl said : 'I'm gonna fire him.' I answered that this decision required more than one person to be taken since we were a band, that he alone didn't own the majority. All of this because Matt told him he was wrong. The truth is, Matt was right, and Axl wrong indeed.\n\nHard Force: Wrong about what?\n\nDuff: About schedules and the way Axl was late for the next album.\" (Duff, Hard Force, 1999)\n\nQuote\n\nH.R.: Duff told us that the deadline is for Spring 97...\n\nMatt: Absolutely! We want to tour next summer. [...] And now, we work together and an album will be released in 97.\n\nH.R.: How would you react if you received a fax saying that Slash is fired?\n\nMatt: It would be difficult.\n\n(Matt, 09/23/96)\n\nQuote\n\n\"We're definitely getting geared up to do another record,\" says Sorum, who brings his all-star side band, Neurotic Outsiders, to the Warehouse on Sunday. \"We're already starting to make tour plans. We've got a possible tour starting in South America in January and then we're going to stop and finish the record and probably tour next summer.\" (Matt, Toronto Sun, 09/04/96)\n\nAxl tossed out the '96 album with Slash in early January '97 - this would have immediately halted their touring plans in South America for January '97 and delayed the album indefinitely from a projected summer '97 release. Something serious concerning the band's future went down between Axl and Duff/Matt between Duff's December 1996 interview (below) and the first two weeks of January '97 (new drummer auditions started in mid-January).\n\nMy guess, Duff/Matt wanted to tour and complete the '96 album [the initial plan after Slash quit] but Axl changed his mind - he didn't want to tour and opted to reboot the project entirely by scrapping the '96 album.\n\nQuote\n\n12/17/1996\n\nDUFF chat\n\nDuff, are the rumors true about you not being in GNR?\n\nDUFF McKAGEN\n\nI will not elaborate, but yes I am & everything is going to be cool as far as that is concerned.\n\nDuff, what are Axl's plans for GNR now?\n\nDUFF McKAGEN\n\nAsk AXL!\n\nDuff, do you feel like you have to jump when Axl says to, or you are out?\n\nDUFF McKAGEN\n\nAbsolutely not when it comes to AXL's permission. What was printed in Rolling Stone is incorrect & I'm pissed off about it.\n\nIs Guns N' Roses going to release something new soon?\n\nDUFF McKAGEN\n\nWe are starting the record in February.\n\nGuns is doing a record so of course Matt & I will be in the studio for at least 3-4 weeks in February\n\nDuff, do you think that GNR is better off now than it was a year ago?\n\nDUFF McKAGEN\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nDuff, do you have any song titles or an album title for the new GNR CD?\n\nDUFF McKAGEN\n\nWe have song titles, but no album title. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag.\n\nhttp://www.gnrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?id=2968\n\nQuote\n\n\"[The 1996 tracks are] not something I would want to approach (without Slash), because, at the time, there was only one person that I knew who could do certain riffs that way. [...] That's the reason why that material got scrapped.\" (Axl, press release, 08/14/02)\n\nQuote\n\nMatt's situation turned out to be uncertain as well, as the frequent Prince collaborator Michael Bland auditioned for the drumstool in January.\n\n\"I auditioned for them in '97. I think Josh Freese was originally supposed to do the gig. I went to the NAMM show [on 01/16-19/97], and I ran into Axl at the Anaheim Convention Center in California, and then I went to the audition later that night. He was very cool to me. He didn't seem at all like the person the press makes him out to be. The audition went well, but I knew they weren't going to hire me, with them being a bunch of skinny white dudes...[laughs]\" (Drummerworld, 09/06)\n\nQuote\n\n\"MTV Brazil reported late last month that Guns N' Roses had unsuccessfully made overtures to Sepultura drummer Igor Cavalera.\" (All-Star Online, 04/08/97)\n\nQuote\n\n[...] 'At the risk of sounding like a sleazy music biz guy, I met with Axl last week to hear their new demos,' said Moby while he was discussing the future of electronica on a panel at Austin, Texas' South by Southwest Conference. 'They're writing with a lot of loops, and believe it or not, they're doing it better than anybody I've heard lately.'\" (Moby, Allstar, 03/18/97)\n\nThe stuff I've heard is much more concise than, say, 'November Rain.' Not bombastic. Very stripped down. Very intense. It's not hard-rock music in the way that 'Welcome to the Jungle' was.'\" (Moby, Icon Magazine, 10/97)\n\nOne of the demos Moby might've been presented with was the work-in-progress track, Oh My God. Mentioning Matt suggests the song existed in some form in February/March '97.\n\n\"Musically the song was primarily written by Paul Huge [in early 1997], with Dizzy Reed writing the musical hook of the chorus. Former member Duff McKagan as well as former employee Matt Sorum failed to see its potential and showed no interest in exploring, let alone recording the piece.\" (Axl, Press Release, 09/22/99)\n\nQuote\n\nFormer Employee\n\nThe inclusion of Robin proved out to be Matt's last significant contribution for the band.\n\n\"I told Axl to see him and he said 'That's our guitar player,'\" says Sorum. \"I said, 'Bring in Robin to play alongside Slash,' but Axl said, 'I want him to play lead.'\" (Spin, 07/99)\n\n\"Matt Sorum introduced Rose to former Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, advising that he would make a great foil for Slash - who could then be restored to the line-up.\" (Q Magazine, 05/01)\n\n\"The lead guitar spot remains open and Slash's return is not out of the question. However, according to our source, the guitarist and Rose haven't spoken at all this year.\" (Addicted to Noise, 03/19/97)\n\n\"Axl had come to simply see the circus (laughs) and he and I had never met and he didn't know I was there. One of the guys Axl was with in the grandstands pointed and said (in hushed excited voice), 'Axl, you see that guitar player down there? That's Robin from Nine Inch Nails.' ... Axl was telling me this after the fact. And he just kind of scratched his head and was sitting there thinking, 'What is he doing here?'\" (Robin, Ultimate Guitar, 01/17/14)\n\n\"I got a call from Axl Rose [while in Cirque du Soleil], who I never met at the time. He invited me to the studio as he was writing and recording songs. It was an invitation for a casual listen. Eventually, after about eight weeks, we started playing together.\" (Robin Finck, 2000)\n\nAxl called Robin no later than mid-January, as he was already playing with the band when Moby came aboard. From 01/29/97 onwards, Cirque du Soleil's Quidam was based in Orange County, between their two stays in Santa Monica, enabling Robin to divide his time between GNR and the circus.\n\n\"At that time Axl was no longer playing with Slash but the rest of the original guys were still together. ... He invited me to play with he and the rest of the Guns N' Roses guys at the studio space they were kind of housed in. It was a welcomed opportunity just to play that one day. ... We played Guns songs and some cover songs.\" (Robin, Ultimate Guitar, 01/17/14)\n\n\"I played with Robin a few times and he's a great guy.\" (Duff, Hard Force, 07/99)\n\nhttp://www.gnrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?pid=54758#p54758\n\nSorum probably gets fired in late March/early April which fits in with the known timeline of events. Around that time it seems possible that Matt had jammed with Finck at a few rehearsals [early-mid March]. The band's lineup at this point: Duff, Sorum, Finck, Huge w/ Moby in talks to produce.\n\nGiven Axl was even auditioning drummers as early as January '97, months before Sorum's offical departure. - it would appear the decision had probably been made unofficially in early January of '97 to fire Matt. As per the GnR insider source [see post #1], Matt probably gets his official dismissal letter in late April/early May '97.\n\nQuote\n\n\"I came home, and I said 'I've just been fired'. I remember what time of the year it was... I think it was summer time. Might have been April... March or April. I think so, 1997.\"\n\n(Matt, Lost Rose, 11/21/01)\n\nQuote\n\nApril 18th, 1997 [MTV]\n\nWhile the recently departed Slash hasn't taken Rose to task legally or in the media -- he's kept the door open for a possible reconciliation -- the two are not currently speaking. Slash left the band late last year by mutual agreement over musical direction and personnel disagreements. The former saw Slash partial to the rawer blues-rock sound and Rose, who is currently talking to techno whiz Moby about production duties, pushing for the elaborate. The personnel problem involved the presence of guitarist Paul Huge, Axl's childhood friend, who was openly disliked by Slash.\n\nMatt Sorum, who was playing in both Guns n' Roses and Slash's sideproject Snakepit, is in the middle. Industry reports, denied by G n' R management, have been surfacing that Sorum was no longer with Guns n' Roses and that Chris Vrenna and his former Nine Inch Nails bandmate Robin Finck are working with G n' R.\n\nVrenna, though, has told press sources that he's only met with Guns n' Roses and that Finck has been jamming with Rose, bassist Duff McKagan, parttimer keyboardist Dizzy Reed and the aforementioned Huge.\n\nhttp://www.mtv.com/news/1429820/days-of-guns-n-roses/\n\nQuote\n\n\"April of '[97], right after Matt Sorum left the band... I got a call from those guys about going down and jamming... Duff was still in it... They had already gotten Robin Finck... [Axl] is super well-listened. He was always a big Nails fan... They wanted the option of experimenting with electronics... My role was supposed to be drumming and programming.\" (Chris Vrenna, Spin, 07/99)\n\nQuote\n\nThen during that time I checked my machine one day and Axl Rose called and that’s when that whole Guns N' Roses thing happened.\n\nDRE: What did you do with them?\n\nCV: When Axl was rebuilding the band every week I was the first guy that was going to be the new drummer after Matt Sorum left. So I was going to be the programmer, drummer and Moby was going to produce. It was like the first incarnation of new people. Duff was even still there and Buckethead wasn’t.\n\nDRE: Got any shit to talk about that?\n\nCV: [laughs] There’s nothing to talk about. Everyone was really nice but I just didn’t really want to do that. I just got out of ten year group and if I was going to do it I would have had to sign a long term commitment. I said “If you’ve already spent right years trying to make a record and you’re only still doing this. Then it could be another eight years.” It was not long after that when I started jotting down stuff about tweaker.\n\nhttp://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/news/shownews.php?newsid=1044\n\nQuote\n\nJan 12, 2010\n\nRafi: I know you worked with Axl Rose on Guns N’ Roses for a bit, but then declined to be part of the band. What happened there?\n\nChris Vrenna: Well that was right after I had left NIN and Robin Finck was in the band as well after leaving NIN and Cirque du Soleil. Axl Rose is a much more forward thinking person than people give him credit for, very smart and well read guy. Axl really loved NIN, in one of his music videos he is even wearing the old white NIN “Sin” t-shirt. I was in the band for a few months and Moby was going to produce the album at the time. It was a brutal schedule of working five nights a week from 10am to 6pm, Axl came down there maybe a hand full of times. It was just not what I was looking for at the time, I knew that this process was going to last a few years, and I had just left NIN so I was really anxious to get back out there and work with other people. But it was really cool, getting to hang out with all of them. We ended up playing the whole ‘Appetite for Destruction’ album from top to bottom, which really made me happy to get that opportunity.\n\nhttp://vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=447&t=Interview%20with%20Chris%20Vrenna%20%28NIN%20/%20Marilyn%20Manson%29\n\nQuote\n\nOctober 26, 1997\n\nDave Abbruzzese (ex Pearl Jam, current Green Romance Orchestra drummer) confirmed that he got together with Axl at some point. He won't be working with GN'R, but he says that it'll be great when they're done.\n\nWhen asked who was in GN'R, he replied \"G & R are made up of a bunch of great guys! You'll know who when \"they\" tell YOU!\".\n\nhttp://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/news/shownews.php?newsid=32\n\nQuote\n\nNext to try out the drum stool was former Pearl Jam member Dave Abbruzzese.\n\n\"Dave Abbruzzese (ex-Pearl Jam) has been rehearsing with GN'R in Los Angeles.\" (MTV Brazil, 05/01/97)\n\n\"Abbruzzese reportedly flew to Los Angeles from Seattle last week to work on the project.\" (All-Star Online, 04/29/97)\n\n\"Matt confirmed that both Chris Vrenna (ex-Nine Inch Nails) and Dave Abbruzzese (ex-Pearl Jam) has been/is working with GN'R (according to Matt, Dave is now in the studio with the band). He also confirmed that Moby was working with them.\" (Allstar, 05/13/97)\n\nQuote\n\nDel James: Who's your favorite drummer you've worked with?\n\nAxl: The rehearsals with [Dave] Abruzzesse and Pod [Vrenna] as a duo were really cool; it was a shame then that it didn't work out but seemed for the best once we found Josh. In regard to old Guns, I don't listen much and for different reasons -- more because of the drums than anything else.\n\n(Axl, Spinner, 02/27/09)\n\nQuote\n\nJuly 4th, 1997\n\nAccording to MTV, both Geffen and Big FD has denied the reports that Matt Sorum has been fired.\n\nGN'R are supposed to be in the studio with Mike Clink and Moby.\n\nhttp://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/news/shownews.php?newsid=22\n\nQuote\n\n02/20/1998\n\nAs for bassist Duff McKagan, Goldstein reports that the G n' R bass slot will be held open until McKagan -- who's recently become a father -- decides on his future plans. \"The jury is still out on [drummer] Matt Sorum,\" Goldstein admits, adding that Axl has tried out different drummers. . . .\n\nhttp://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/news/shownews.php?newsid=44\n\nBetween May '97 - Feb '98, they left the door open through official channels for Matt. Was it to see if Matt would apologize to Axl and grovel enough to get the job back? Doubtful. Given the January drummer auditions, I suspect Matt was getting fired one way or another. I doubt he had a place in the band or with Axl in '97 - they may have toyed with the idea of keeping him \"in play\" as a backup while the Vrenna/Abruzzese sessions went nowhere [April - June '97] and the band had no official drummer.\n\nAfter Duff's resignation, it seems like Matt's attempts to reach out to Axl were ignored. Matt says in 2001 he had made 4 calls to Axl. [Major speculation here] : Any guesses that the 4 calls may have been spaced out between Christmas '97 - '00? Maybe that Christmas '97 call from Matt made Axl consider the idea of reinstating him [Goldstein's Feb '98 quote about Matt still being an option] but within a few months, Freese is in and signed by mid-late March '98.\n\nQuote\n\n03/06/1998\n\nL.A. session drummers are fervently hoping there's truth to the rumor that Josh Freese has accepted or is about to accept an offer from Guns N' Roses.\n\nFreese is one of the most desirable skin beaters on the market and certainly one of the busiest. He's best known as the drummer for The Vandals and former Replacement leader Paul Westerberg, but his credits also include Devo (he played with them on this past year's Lollapalooza tour), Juliana Hatfield, Tracey Bonham, the Daredevils and Thermadore among many, many others.\n\nSources close to Freese confirm that he's been joining Axl Rose in the studio late at night while continuing to do his regular sessions in the daytime. When asked if Freese was the new G n' R drummer, a spokesperson for Geffen, quoting the band's management, told MTV News, \"There's nothing we can confirm at this time, hopefully soon, but not now.\"\n\nG n' R's manager, Doug Goldstein, recently told \"Rolling Stone's\" Matt Hendrickson that former Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck has become a fulltime member of the band. He also said that Rose is writing and jamming with keyboardist Dizzy Reed and guitarist and longtime Rose collaborator Paul Huge and that the bass slot was being left open until Duff McKagan makes a final decision on his plans for the future. Goldstein told Hendrickson that they were \"three to five months away from actual recording\" and not to expect a record until 1999.\n\nhttp://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/news/shownews.php?newsid=46\n\nQuote\n\nOn May Day '98, Geffen Records officially acknowledged the departure of Slash and Duff from GNR.\n\n\"Since 1992, [GNR and Geffen Records] have executed various amendments to the Recording Agreement, including most notably, two amendments dated as of May 1, 1998.\n\nOne of these amendments [...] confirmed Slash's and Duff's departure from the band and their status as \"Leaving Members\" under the 1992 Recording Agreement, thereby relieving them of charges against their royalty accounts for the enormous recording costs and other expenses being incurred by Axl Rose in connection with the recording of the new Guns N' Roses studio album.\n\n- It looks like for the entirety of 97/early '98, Axl appears to have been holding out for his #1 choice Josh Freese [Prince's drummer confirms in an earlier quote above that he thought Josh Freese was originally supposed to do the gig prior to his January '97 audition.] - More proof that Sorum was finished in the band by late '96/early Jan '97. Axl probably reached out to Freese around that time to take the drumming gig.\n\nFreese accepts the position 13 months later and the door officially closes on Sorum. The following month, Freese helps recruit Tommy Stinson into the band and that closes the door on Duff coming back and torpedoes any remote chance of Matt returning.\n\nQuote\n\nA year later, a final insult from Axl to Matt:\n\nLive Era 87-93 releases in late '99:\n\nThe album has generated a fair deal of controversy. Firstly, drummer Steven Adler and rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin are listed in the credits as Guns N' Roses members, while drummer Matt Sorum and rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke are simply listed as \"additional musicians\", despite playing on the majority of the tracks on the album.\n\nhttp://www.gunsnroses.wikia.com/wiki/Live_Era:_'87–'93\n\nL.A. Weekly reporter Art Tavana was recently interviewed on Appetite for Distortion and discussed Guns N’ Roses’ rumored 2016 offer to Matt Sorum. Alternative Nation transcribed the quotes.\n\n“This is not a secret, Matt Sorum was offered the similar kind of Steven Adler thing, where hey, you can play a couple shows.”\n\nHe added, “He was offered spots, and he refused because he wasn’t getting paid what he thought he should have gotten paid is what I’m told.”\n\nMatt Sorum tweeted in April that he ‘wasn’t asked’ to take part in the Guns N’ Roses reunion. “No sir, they didn’t ask me.”\n\nTavana also discussed Steven Adler.\n\n“[Steven] Adler’s back is too injured to be a full time member of the band. I don’t think would have ever been a full time member of the band, even if he was fully healthy, because Frank [Ferrer] is an Axl guy, the same way Richard Fortus is, so that will never change. I don’t personally think [Adler] will be involved in songwriting, I don’t think he ever was. I love Adler, I think he’s one of the best parts of [Appetite for Destruction].”\n\nMatt Sorum was interviewed by WRIF in June, and before the pre-recorded interview played, the host mentioned that he was asked to not ask about Guns N’ Roses during the interview. Despite this, Sorum hinted and alluded to his exclusion from Guns N’ Roses’ ‘Not In This Lifetime’ tour a few times during the interview. Alternative Nation transcribed some quotes from the 25 minute interview.\n\nSorum discussed his place in bands he’s been in, “I’ve always been a little bit more of an outspoken guy in a band, and maybe that’s why I move around so much (laughs).”\n\nHe later said, “Obviously there’s bands of mine that I’ve been playing with over the years that are out on the road doing different things. People go, ‘Hey Matt, Don’t you wish you were doing that?’ I go, ‘No, I like what the next thing brings.'”\n\nSorum later discussed having faith in rock and roll, and his outlook on life, specifically when it came to being left out of things.\n\n“Don’t ever get like oh hey, I got left out of that, or I got left out of this. The idea is gratitude. I heard Hillary Clinton talk about this the other day. They were asking her about her faith, and she said she studies gratitude every day. I thought if we have a President who is pushing a sermon of gratitude, that sounds pretty good to me. Because we’re always kind of nay saying on everything in life, but we seem to forget what we have.\n\nI always reflect on what I’ve been given. You don’t get it for free, you’ve got to go out and work for it, and you have to have a certain talent, and I don’t take my talent for granted. So when I go into a situation, I come in there ready, professional, with the best attitude possible. I’ve been blessed, I go, I’m grateful. That’s not always been me, I’ve got to be honest, but as you get a little older in life you go oh wow, life’s pretty good.”"
