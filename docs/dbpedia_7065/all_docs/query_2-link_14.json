But, that has a tendency to be unending work--with no relief in sight. Relief showed up recently in this poem by Martha Postlewaite. The idea of \"creating a clearing in the dense forest of our lives\" and waiting there patiently is an extraordinary wake up. To slow down. To be present. For me, it is only in the spacious quiet in my life that I can hear the song of my calling.\n\nQuestions for conversation or reflection:\n\nWhat processes have you found for creating that clearing? What are the circumstances in which it occurs for you?\n\nWhere do you find support for that process?\n\nHow do you balance the practical demands for action with the deeper need for the clearing?"
