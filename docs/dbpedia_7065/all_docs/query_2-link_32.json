        "text": "Reigning Olympic and world champions, FIVB World Ranking leaders and defending Ostrava trophy-holders Anders Mol & Christian Sorum triumphed once again at the Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour Elite16 menâs tournament that finished on Sunday in Czechiaâs third largest city. It was the Norwegiansâ third overall podium-topper in Ostrava, after they also won the 4-star event on the 2019 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour. The Beachvolley Vikings have now raised their Beach Pro Tour medal count to 10 items, including a record-breaking six gold medals.\n\nÂ·Â Watch Beach Pro Tour Ostrava Elite16 replays onÂ VBTV.\n\nThe silver medals went to Qatarâs Cherif Younousse & Ahmed Tijan. For the Tokyo 2020 Olympic bronze medallists, it was the first podium of the season and fifth overall on the Beach Pro Tour since it was launched last year.\n\nUSAâs Miles Partain & Andrew Benesh, seeded 13th in the main draw bracket, made their way to the podium after starting their Ostrava quest from Wednesdayâs qualifiers. Their bronze was the pairâs second medal on the Beach Pro Tour, after the gold they took at the first Dubai Challenge in October.\n\nIn Sundayâs gold medal match, Mol & Sorum dominated the first set to edge forward on the scoreboard, but seventh-seeded Cherif & Ahmed fought back in the second to push the final to a third-set decider. Regaining control on the court, the Norwegians made sure they stay in front on the way to Molâs kill block that ended it at their way. Molâs blocking efforts accounted for as many as six of his 28 points in the match. Sorum finished with 19 points as both he and his partner managed to ace twice each during the game. Ahmedâs 22-point tally included an ace and a block, while Cherif raised three stuffs towards a 15-point total.\n\nâThis means everything! Itâs so special to play here in Ostrava, in front of all these amazing people,â said Mol at the end of the match. âI also want to thank my partner. He did a great job today. The Qatar boys really gave us a super strong match. They hit around my block every single ball, so it was really, really tough and we are just super happy. Thank you so much to the organizers for bringing out this event, because itâs one of the greatest events of the year and we hope to play here for the next 10 years at least...â\n\nâI have Anders Mol by my side. Heâs been amazing once again the whole tournament and itâs just an honour to play by his side and especially in front of so many awesome people and against so many great opponents that push us to play better. Team effort from everyone...â Sorum pointed out.\n\nIn the third place game, Partain & Benesh had to go against home favourites Ondrej Perusic & David Schweiner and the fantastic Ostrava crowd on the centre court stands that cheered the Czech team on. However, that seemed to be counter-productive for the Perusic & Schweiner this time as they made far too many unforced errors allowing the Americans to dominate throughout the match and celebrate a upset of the fourth-seeded opponents. Schweiner was the best scorer of the match with 18 points, while defender Perusic finished with seven. Benesh had 15 and Partain â 13.\n\nâIt feels great!â exclaimed Partain. âIt was such a miracle to qualify and then just being able to break pool and just play one point at a time... Thank god for it because qualification was really difficult. We had pretty much already lost and somehow we were able to come back.â\n\nâIt was really fun to play in front of the Ostrava fans,â Benesh added. âCongratulations to Ondrej and David too! They are a really great team, one of the top teams in the world. And yes, Iâm pretty tired and I am going to go take a nap pretty soon.â"
