        "text": "Adler is one of the best drummers from that era... Sorum played with no soul and the subtlety of a sledgehammer! And he endorsed those awful black plastic sticks.. Enough said!!\n\nIt's like Dave grohl vs Taylor Hawkins.. Grohl is a monster of a player with amazingly musical parts and feel.. Whereas Hawkins is all arms and grunts but no soul.. IMO\n\nAdler.. Clive burr... Dave grohl.. My fave drummers of the 80's and 90's and up there with the very best... RIP Clive\n\nI'd hate to denounce Matt Sorum. I haven't really listened to his work with the Cult or anything. As I recall on UYI he was supposedly recorded separately from the other members who were recorded separately from each other with each one coming in and doing just their part. I haven't listened to Spaghetti. So I'll say that the results on UYI I & II were less than inspiring. Matt Sorum may clearly be a MORE SKILLED drummer than Steven Adler... but the sound of the band on Appetite is just a whole different one from Use Your Illusion. Adler has SERIOUS deficiencies as a drummer.. which puts him in good company in classic rock!\n\nI recall interviews at the time where Sorum talking about Axl telling him to play like Nigle Ollson: those big long fills, which were great with Elton John, but ..... who wants to be told to play just like another guy? ..... Also, Guns was getting bloated by the time Sorum came on: keyboards, back-up singers etc, so it was likely a tough spot to be in .... Sorum is fantastic on the Cult albums. He's like a Phil Rudd type guy on that stuff...... But with Guns it was just weird, and I don't blame him at all. Also, Sorum was behind the kit when they were playing the most gigantic of gigantic enormo-halls. Therefore different moves were called for.\n\nHowever: Adler was just THE perfect fit. He swung, he dragged the beat, he had attitude, pocket, and just enough skill and finesse.... He was just everything you want/need in a rock n roll drummer. The band lost a lot when he was sacked, thought I don't blame them in the least for sacking him.\n\nHow is Adler as a drummer today compared to before, that is what I would like to know? I've seen a few videos and he's pretty messed up from all the drugs that led to his stroke. I would love to see him get another chance and Guns N Roses getting all back together but I doubt that will ever happen.\n\nOf course, Steven still kills it on Appetite songs (heck, he had 25 years to practice 12 songs, sure hope he does!):\n\nBut considering his past health history, I doubt he'd be able to handle a full blown GNR reunion tour if there ever was one. Not to mention I wouldn't want to hear him on stuff like Estranged or Nov Rain."
