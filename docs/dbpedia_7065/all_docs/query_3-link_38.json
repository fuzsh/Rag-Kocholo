        "text": "The Beachvolley Vikings were the worldâs number one team when medical problems forced them to stay off the Tour for about three months earlier this year, from March to June, and the absence caused them to lose their leading position; that and, of course, Swedish pair David Ahman & Jonatan Hellvigâs fantastic results in the mean time. Mol & Sorum gave up the number one spot to Ahman & Hellvig on April 22. They fell further down from the number two spot on May 27 and then sank as low as number 11 right before rejoining the Tour with an Ostrava Elite16 fourth place and starting their climb back up the chart.\n\nDespite a bronze medal finish at their next event in Gstaad, the Norwegians were still ranked eighth before last weekâs Vienna Elite16, partially because they had collected only seven point-carrying appearances over the past one-year period (with the best eight results counting towards the World Ranking). Hence, they held on to the entire 1,200 points that came with their first place in Austria and sky-rocketed up to the number two position in the chart on a new total of 7,860 points. That is 300 clear of previous number two Andre Stein & George Wanderley of Brazil, who did not net-gain any new points in Vienna, but still a solid 1,880 points below leaders Ahman & Hellvig, who did not compete at last weekâs Elite16 event.\n\nWith Mol & Sorumâs rise, the several teams they surpassed each dropped a spot down, including Germanyâs Clemens Wickler & Nils Ehlers, who achieved a fourth-place finish in Vienna. Despite gaining a net of 140 points, the Germans still descended from number three to number four on a total of 7,360 points. One of the four fifth-placed teams in the menâs tournament, Netherlandsâ Stefan Boermans & Yorick de Groot, also shifted down a spot, from fourth to fifth, on 7,260 points. The other three duos that were eliminated in the quarterfinals kept their current positions: USAâs Miles Partain & Andrew Benesh in number nine, Steven van de Velde & Matthew Immers in number 10, and Spainâs Pablo Herrera & Adrian Gavira in number 17."
