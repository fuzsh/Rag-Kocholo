        "text": "“I really miss rock stars,” explains drummer, Matt Sorum. “I used to go to shows and see excess and the rock and roll life style, it was great…there was Zeppelin, Sabbath and the Stones and they were all flashy and full-on rock stars. Back then they were my bands, you know, and if anyone talked shit about them…we’d go to blows! But nowadays that’s all changed, ever since punk and grunge, it seems like everyone and anyone is in a band. There are a lot of bald heads and loud guitars out there, but none of it is rock and roll.”\n\nWell, fear not my fellow friends of blistering guitar discord, the days of rock and roll excess, may soon be resurrected if the Cult have their way. Originally called the Southern Death Cult, the band was formed in Brixton London back in early 1981 by Ian Astbury. Astbury, the son of a naval merchant soon recruited ex-Theater of Hate guitarist Billy Duffy, who once played in a pre-Smiths combo with Morrissey. Eventually the band’s name was simplified to the Cult and their line-up solidified, well…for a short while anyhow. Throughout their career they’ve exchanged a large amount of bassists and drummers and have enjoyed success and fame all the while creating a massive genre hoping anomaly.\n\nIn the beginning, the Cult’s ethereal 1985 debut, Dreamtime, (released on the tiny U.K., independent label called Beggars Banquet) garnered the band a very small following back home. Fortunately their fan base grew and spread across the pond by the following year when Sire records picked them up and released their major label debut album titled Love. By the time of their next release, Sonic Temple, the group had worked with producer extrodinare Rick Ruben, (Beastie Boys, Run DMC) charted with two U.K. top twenty singles and was on their way to playing big-time metal. To some, the Cult and their never ending quest to try out new genres and styles was a brilliant parody and to others the Cult was the real thing. In 1989 Sonic Temple (Sire) went platinum, in 91 the band released Ceremony, which did not do too well in the eyes of critics or with their fans. After a three-year hiatus, the band released their self-titled Cult album.\n\nThen came the tumultuous late ‘90s. Throughout the 80’s and early ‘90s things were going well for Astbury and the rest of his Cult. The band’s genre hopping even provoked Astbury to take this idea a step farther. Brilliantly, he combined bands from all over the map to play together. And in the early ‘90s he organized the pre-Lollapalooza “Gathering of the Tribes” festival tour. Unfortunately by 1995, rock and roll; the drugs and the excess, started to take a toll on the band. Tensions mounted between the guitarist and singer, who had just lost his father, and the Cult sadly broke up in 1995.\n\n“I was playing with my current project a few years back,” explains ex-Guns n’ Roses drummer, Sorum, who telephoned before sound check from Arizona. “I invited Ian and Billy up on stage to jam, it went well, you know, so we decided to get the band back together.”\n\nYes, you heard right the ever genre-hopping Cult are back after a seven year hiatus and are ready to bring back good ol’ rock and roll. Last year the band quickly sold out the 3,850-capacity Roseland Ballroom in New York City and did nine sold out nights at L.A.’s House of Blues. The Cult, this summer, will tour nationally and play several radio shows with bands nearly half their age. How will the Cult come across to the average 13-year-olds who have shown up to see the likes of Linkin Park and Papa Roach? “We’ll go out and show them what the fuck rock and roll is all about,” says Sorum. “It’s time for a change in music and we’ll start that change. It’s not that I think there is anything wrong with that sort of music, in fact we listen to it to stay current. We want to be current…we want to be now.”\n\nThe beginning of June saw the release of the much anticipated “BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL”, released on Lava/Atlantic records. The new album is not a rehashing of worn out Cult faves, but rather new Cult music capturing the band at a crossroads and possibly it’s heaviest. “We’re very fucking proud of this album and to be signed to Atlantic Lava,” says Sorum. “I miss records like this one.” Produced by Bob Rock, the album isn’t overly flashy or too polished, it’s not filled with de-tuned guitars and mushy bass lines, it’s loud, abrasive and pure rock and roll. Billy Duffy is back on guitar, Sorum is behind the drums and Ian Astbury, minus his signature long tresses, is back leading the band down a path of rock and roll excess once again. “When we came back together again we realized we weren’t done, Astbury says. “I feel like we were exiled to the mountain and now that things aren’t working we’ve been called back.”\n\nSpeaking of mountains, Astury recently had quite an experience on mountains far away from home. Several months ago, before the Cult reunited, Astbury found himself in a struggle for life high up in the Himalayas. During a trip to find himself, Astbury and twelve other extremists nearly died in the Yeti fraught wilderness of Tibet. Their truck broke down, hypothermia began to set in, and Astbury had dislocated his shoulder. After hours of agony and struggle the singer had made peace with death and the thought of leaving behind his two young children. But Astbury survived and is much stronger as a result-both physically, mentally, and spiritually. The trip cleansed the singer, “(in Tibet) I saw a guy dragged out of his shop and dumped into the back of a truck,” says Astbury. “I’ve seen a soldier take a rifle butt to the back of an old man’s head to move him along. But it’s everywhere in the world. If you have any kind of resistance to the mainstream you’ll quickly be shut down-either violently or you will be absorbed by society. There’s a strange, oily feeling in the world right now. You can’t quite get a grip on it, it’s intangible. I think it’s due to a lack of spirituality. Rock right now is full of crying, complaining and aggression. There’s a lot of ‘fuck you’s’ and ‘I’m not going to do what you tell me.’ But what are you going to do? No one’s offering a solution. I’ll offer one: read books. Find your role model.”\n\nRole models…well maybe it’s not role models but rock stars, again that is the something that is missing in today’s rock and roll. “I remember getting really excited about going to shows,” admits Sorurm. “But, nowadays there isn’t anything left to get excited about…but that’s where we fit in. We’re trying to bring back rock and roll and with this album and tour, we will.” Currently embarked on a nation wide tour, the Cult are not nostalgic. “This is a spiritual holy war,” says Astbury, “if you’re going on stage to perform, you’ve got to be fucking good in contemporary terms.”"
