        "text": "We could all learn a little bit from each other and it’s not always easy to stop and have a conversation in the middle of a WOD. This series will give you some inside information on some of our most loyal members. Today we’re talking with Jim Sorum.\n\nQ: What do you do for a living?\n\nI am a Cardiac Monitor Technician at St. Marys.\n\nQ: What’s your favorite thing to do outside of the gym?\n\nRead, play with the dog, or watch movies.\n\nQ: Favorite genre of music?\n\nRock.\n\nQ: Favorite cheat day meal?\n\nPho and Bean Sweetie at Pho Chau, Pizza and BMW at The Thirsty Belgian, Mango Souffle at La Plobana.\n\nQ: Chalk or no chalk?\n\nNo chalk.\n\nQ: Do you hate wall balls as much as the rest of us?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nQ: What’s your favorite movement?\n\nDouble unders, box jumps, rope climbing, tire flipping, pull ups (not the silly chest to bar kind), sledge hammering.\n\nQ: What’s your least favorite movement?\n\nWall balls, muscle ups, dips.\n\nQ: What goal(s) are you currently chasing?\n\n175 unbroken double unders, 200# C&J, improved handstand walking, doing my best each day.\n\nQ: Best piece of advice you’ve gotten from a coach?\n\nI get so much good advice most days.\n\nQ: How do you make time to get to the gym?\n\nAs a single non-parent, I don’t have much else to occupy my time and most everything else in my life is scheduled around the gym. So I don’t have to make time for the gym. I love CrossFit. I should try harder to make time for other things.\n\nQ: Why do you make time to get to the gym?\n\nMainly because I enjoy it and think it is great fun. But also I’m not the most social person so it gives me time to be around people, besides work.\n\nQ: How has your outlook on fitness changed since starting CrossFit?\n\nWhen I started, functionality in exercising wasn’t really emphasized and while I also thought it was important, since staring CrossFit I see how extremely important it should be.\n\nQ: How has your outlook on yourself changed since starting CrossFit?\n\nI’m more confident, happier, and more content.\n\nQ: How would you explain the feeling you have before you get to the gym each day?\n\nAnticipation, nervous energy, excitement for what I may be able to accomplish.\n\nQ: How would you explain the feeling you get after you leave the gym each day?\n\nHopefully a sense of accomplishment and feeling ready for the day.\n\nQ: How has your life outside of CrossFit changed since joining CFP?\n\nI was doing CrossFit for many years alone before joining CFP so it hasten’ really changed that much. Most of the outside the gym benefits I had already experienced before getting to CFP. Now I’m just not as lonely and odd looking in my fitness pursuits.\n\nQ: What has been your fondest memory during your time at CFP?\n\nGreg Glassman, CrossFit Co-Founder, and most of the top people in CrossFit have said repeatedly that the secret to CrossFit is the people. The exercises are nothing new and the programming while different isn’t why CrossFit is growing rapidly. It is the people. I’ve met some great people through CrossFit and get to interact with many of them 5-6 days a week to this day.\n\nQ: What brought you to CFP?\n\nI had been doing CrossFit on my own for years and heard some guys were looking to open a gym. I got Josh’s name from a friend and connected on Facebook. I didn’t join since I was working at a gym at the time but kept in touch and when I left the gym I was working at I got a punch card but knew quickly I needed a full membership.\n\nQ: What keeps you at CFP?\n\nI love it.\n\nQ: What would be your one piece of advice for someone who’s just joining CFP?\n\nIt’s going to be hard and many days you may want to quit but keep at it. You will see the results you want. Also, get involved in the community; that is the magic.\n\nJim is like an iceberg. What you see on the surface is just a fraction of what he has to offer. Chances are you could learn a lot from Jim by just watching him but stop and chat with the self proclaimed introvert next time you see him because make no mistake… this guy’s a badass and I’m not just talking about his cheat day meals."
