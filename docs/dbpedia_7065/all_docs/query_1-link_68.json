        "text": "While everyone wants to be a rock star, very few can pull off leather pants, or the \"Steven Tyler Look\" (an assortment of interlocking scarves). For a classier breed of rocker-wear, try Sorum Noce.\n\nHoused in a chandeliered gents' boudoir, SN comes from the seemingly random pairing of fashionisto Max Noce (Valentino, D&G) and Zildjianisto Matt Sorum (G N'R, The Cult, and the recently Weiland-bereft Velvet Revolver). The gear's all custom-fitted, and rests on Noce's timeless inspiration -- \"elegant, English tailored, black, and small\" -- but draws rock from the likes of Thin-White-Duke-era Bowie and Depeche Mode, who wore black, and were small. Pieces range from silk-lined vests and suit jackets with working-button sleeves, to polka-dotted button ups, to leather jackets conforming to a Slash-requested design: Italian zippers on the sides, and an extra-wide pocket for his lighter and Gitanes."
