        "text": "Matt Sorum was born in Long Beach, California in the rock ânâ roll heyday of the â60s.\n\nAt 14-years-old, Sorum was wailing with his band The Prophecy alongside the likes of Van Halen and Devo at The Whisky-A-Go-Go and Crazy Horse West. Over the next few years, Sorum honed his chops in numerous session gigs with artists such as Shaun Cassidy, Belinda Carlisle and King Solomon Burke, solidifying his reputation as a go-to studio drummer.\n\nIn the midst of balancing 40 gigs at a time, Sorum crossed paths with Tori Amos while she was playing in a hotel piano bar. Immediately, they connected, forming Y Kant Tori Read. After rocking clubs for two years, Atlantic signed the band. Amos went solo shortly after, but opportunity came to Sorum. He joined The Jeff Paris band, recording for Polygram in 1987.\n\nThe next step skyrocketed him into the consciousness of music fans worldwide though. Hearing about auditions for The Cult, he tried out. Bashing out each track with unshakable conviction, he got the job. For two years, Sorum rocked all over the world in The Cult on tours with Metallica and Aerosmith. The jaunt brought Sorum back home in the summer of 1990. Duff McKagan and Slash of Guns Nâ Roses caught that particular tour-ending gig and were blown away by Sorum, quickly asking him to join GNâR.\n\nWith a mere month of rehearsals, the band recorded the landmarkâUse Your Illusion 1 & 2. A marathon of touring followed for three years, playing stadiums with sit-in guests such as Brian May, Jeff Beck, Ronnie Rood, Steven Tyler and Elton John. GNâR hit The Freddie Mercury Tribute at Wembley Stadium as well as four sold-out nights in Los Angeles at The Forum and Madison Square Garden .\n\nGNâR dropped The Spaghetti Incident? in 1993 and received two Grammy award nominations and two MTV Awards. Selling thirty-million records with Guns Nâ Roses, Sorum joined forces with Steve Jones [The Sex Pistols], John Taylor [Duran Duran] and Duff for Neurotic Outsiders, recording an album for Maverick rocking star-studded weekly gigs at The Viper Room in 1996. While Guns went through various evolutions, Sorum crushed on solo tracks for Duff, Slash and Gilby Clarke.\n\nOfficially moving on from GNâR in 1997, Sorum brought his talents behind the board. He produced a Top 40 single for Poe entitled âAngry Johnnyâ as well as tracks âHelloâ and âA Rose is a Roseâ for Hollywood Records. Realizing he had a natural knack for bringing the best out of artists, he formed Orange Curtain productions. He completed six film scores and produced platinum-selling artists including Candlebox, Sen Dog of Cypress Hill, Little Milton and Ronnie Spector.\n\nHowever, drums always beckoned him back. Upon finishing a two-year stint rocking with The Cult, Sorum found himself in the studio with McKagan and Slash. The three shared a chemistry that could never be matched, and they founded Velvet Revolver. With Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots singing, Sorum released two explosive albums with Velvet RevolverâContraband in 2004 and Libertad in 2007. World tours saw the band etch a legacy of their own buttressed by the hits âFall to Piecesâ as well as âSet Me Freeââpropelled by a riff Matt wrote. In addition, âSlitherâ garnered the band a Grammy for a âBest Hard Rock Performanceâ and the band received another three Grammy nominations. Contraband also debuted at number one on the Billboard Top 200, selling three-million copies. Matt was inducted into The Rock N Roll Hall of Fame with fellow Guns N Roses members in 2013.\n\nBetween the madness of touring with Velvet Revolver, Sorum recorded his first solo record, Hollywood Zenâa pensive, poignant and poetic offering that saw Matt singing as well as playing guitar and drums. As if that werenât enough to keep him busy, he also joined Los Angelesâs coolest cover band Camp Freddy with Janeâs Addictionâs Dave Navarro. Camp Freddyâs Los Angeles shows have become legendary with guest appearances ranging from Ozzy Osbourne and Corey Taylor of Slipknot to Juliette Lewis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park.\n\nMatt also joined up with Alice Cooper, Joe Perry and Johnny Depp to tour Europe and the US with Hollywood Vampires starting with warm up gigs at the world famous Roxy on the Sunset Strip followed by a headlining slot at Rock N Rio in Rio, Brazil.\n\nThe Vampires also appeared on the 2016 Grammy awards performing an original track entitled âBad as I amâ followed by a tribute to the late Lemmy Kilmister with a rowdy version of âAce of Spadesâ\n\nMatt was also a member of supergroup Velvet Revolver earning Sorum three Grammy nominations and one win with their hit Slither. Sorum has a Billboard , two MTV award and one American Music Award.\n\nSorum is also a member of his touring project, Kings of Chaos with Billy Gibbons and Robin Zander among others as well as Supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper , Joe Perry and Johnny Depp , Matt did two stints with The Cult. He also did one tour with Motorhead .
