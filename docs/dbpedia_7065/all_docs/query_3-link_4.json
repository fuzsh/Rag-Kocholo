The idea of a regular Mol option game is simultaneously incredibly attractive and terrifying.\n\nPost by guest2 on\n\nThis is a horrendous idea for them. Mols armswing range is built for the Right side. He become more predictable and not as dominant on the left. AdditionLly, Sorum on the left gives him options to run both forward and back sets.\n\nDo the Czechs run a lot of option balls? No. They run an offense designed around getting the attacker to his spot and chopping with his options. If what it takes for the Vikings win percentage to drop to 50% is Sorums back, then hire a new trainer and get healthy.\n\nDid I assert that the Czechs play the option a lot?\n\nTo your point about Mol's alleged inability to play the left, players with swings seemingly designed to play one side or the other (I am thinking both Rosie, Steffes, and Phil here) have successfully transitioned when they put in the time and work. Can't really think of any top player that really dedicated themself that was unable to switch sides, particularly one as physically dominant as Mol.\n\nSecond, if Mol is marginally less effective on normal sideouts (i.e. when the ball is served to him) so what? Since it is extremely rare he will be the primary target anyway. This team's issues are: 1) Sorum's sideout game and 2) They don't score as well as they used to.\n\nThird, this would freshen up their play, which is excellent but stale. With these two where they are, everyone knows them, has scouted them, has seen them for years. Showing teams a new look would change the way other teams play them.\n\nRight now they are basically playing evenly (6-5) with three teams that they are superior to both physically and skill-wise. That only leaves strategy that needs to change. You also mention that Sorum's health caused them to drop to .500 while ignoring they got a ton of injury breaks this year. I believe they played 2 events where the Czechs, Swedes, and Miles/Andy were all healthy and entered. (Vikings lost both)\n\nNot sure that 1) Its possible for Sorum to be consistently 100%. These injury issues with him seem to be consistent and 2) Not sure even a healthy Sorum gets them much past where they were this year in a season where Sweden, the Czechs, and the US are all healthy (and if the Russians come back?)\n\nThey will win a lot, and do it consistently, but if they want to dominate again, I think something needs to change\n\nPost by guest2 on\n\nThis is a horrendous idea for them. Mols armswing range is built for the Right side. He become more predictable and not as dominant on the left. AdditionLly, Sorum on the left gives him options to run both forward and back sets.\n\nIf teams aren't serving Mol does it matter?\n\nIf we take the assertion at face value - that Sorum's sideout ability determines their win chance in a top 5 match - then they either need to increase his sideout or remove service pressure from him.\n\nI wondered how accurate my perception was, so I looked back at the matches they lost this year, its nice its so few that its not a big problem to look at them all. I added info about how many attempts each had when there was a disparity. I think its fair to say a small rise in Sorum's hitting percentage probably gets them two more wins this year (Uberlandia and Gstaad). Maybe also affects WCs and Hamburg because those were close losses, but Sorum was pretty effective there, so not sure how much better option support would have made him in those matches (and since those weren't finals losses, who can say if they go on to win the whole event).\n\nTepic Final (skunked by Sweden)\n\nBoth guys hit around the same poor percentage on the same attempts\n\nUberlandia (lose 3 setter to Czechs)\n\nSorum hits .290 (about twice as many attempts)\n\nMol .400\n\nGstaad (Menesh -Final)\n\nSorum .230 (twice as many attempts)\n\nMol .320\n\nGstaad (Pool play)\n\nSorum .340\n\nMol .380\n\nHamburg (Italy) - This was a more traditional Vikes loss where the other team just played over their heads.\n\nSorum .440\n\nMol .430 - But struggled in Game 3\n\nWCs (Czechs)\n\nSorum .380 (on 50 attempts)\n\nMol .210 (on 14 attempts)\n\nPost by guest2 on\n\nHuh?\n\nNorway. Healthy. 4-0. Dominating fashion. But a side switch is needed.\n\nAnd if they should lose 1 of the next 2 matches? That would not prove I was right, anymore than making a semi (which they did in every other event this year except 1) proves I was wrong.\n\nWinning this event also doesn't prove that since if you had read what I actually posted, I said if they don't switch they will continue to win events.\n\nThe only way they prove me wrong is if 1) they get back to regular, consistent, dominance or 2) they switch and it doesn't work."
