        "text": "The culture in NYC is shocking as a first-timer. I grew up in the Midwest where most people are willing to help you fix your flat tire. But they also typically suffer from closed-mindedness. Here in NYC, it seems like everyone is fending for themselves - looking out for #1. But there‚Äôs also a sense of pride and community. Everyone is just trying to make it - together. This is why collective consciousness is so interesting to me. We have this ego - this character we play. A separate sense of self. And this is a helpful vehicle in the journey of life. But we also get glimpses that there‚Äôs more to us than meets the eye. We‚Äôre all connected and we‚Äôre learning more and more about what that means. I like to take a balanced approach to philosophy and life in general - so I think it‚Äôs important to gain clarity on the ego AND explore the concept of a collective self. This strategy has allowed me to become more like my highest self while also feeling more connected to the people around me. And that‚Äôs what we want, isn‚Äôt it? A life of beauty and wonder for all of us? That‚Äôs exactly what I help my clients do: conquer self-doubt, ignite their true identity, and embrace a life of purpose and abundance in just 90 days - guaranteed or you don‚Äôt pay.

When was that moment you realized you had found your purpose? And when you lose that flame, what do you do to get it back? For me it‚Äôs -Focus on the relationships and remember what and how you make a difference. -Get your hands dirty. Grab that paint brush or hair net. Get back to your AIT roots. -Switch up the routine. Be spontaneous, it‚Äôs one of the perks of working in senior living. How do you reconnect to your passion for serving the most vulnerable members of our community?\n\nTODD'S TAKE: EMBRACING THE JOURNEY (PHOTO: My college apartment) Moving my daughter into her new house at the University of Delaware this weekend got me thinking about my own college days at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania. I dug up a picture of the basement apartment I shared with five other guys. It wasn't fancy‚Äîwood-paneled walls inside, brick fortress outside‚Äîbut we never thought of it as humble. We were just thrilled to be there, enjoying every step of the way. Here‚Äôs what those days taught me: Enjoy the Ride: We focused on the good times and the friendships we built. In business and life, it‚Äôs essential to appreciate the journey and find joy in the moment. Perspective is Everything: Our basement apartment felt like the perfect spot for us. It's a reminder that your outlook can transform any situation. Embrace where you are and make the most of it. Building Bonds: The best relationships often form in the simplest places. It‚Äôs not about where you are, but who you‚Äôre with. This holds true in business‚Äîstrong teams thrive on genuine connections and shared experiences. Looking back, those were some of the best times of my life, not because of where we lived, but because of the bonds we formed and the fun we had. As my daughter moves out of the dorms and into her own place with friends, I hope she finds the same joy and builds friendships that last a lifetime. Here's to appreciating the present, embracing every challenge, and finding happiness in the journey. Got a picture of your first place that you want to share? I'd love to see it and hear your stories! #ToddsTake #CollegeDays #LifeLessons #TKEforLIFE P.S. Worried about your office space? At least you‚Äôre not fighting for shower time with six guys and a single bathroom!\n\nAre you a first or second mountain person? Spoiler alert: We have all been at least one! Almost three years ago I came across New York Times columnist and author David Brooks. He authored a book called Second Mountain that deeply resonated with me. I always felt my life was about the distance I have travelled rather than qualifications, awards and status. Let me explain why. The first mountain describes when we focus in life on ourselves. From.... üßëüèæüíª getting a great job with a known brand üí∞ getting promoted and pay rises üß† becoming known as an expert The descent from the first mountain can be humbling resulting from things such as: üöß layoff from a job üò∑ COVID making you question your purpose and desired lifestyle ü•∫ Going through personal adversity such as loss of a loved one As a result as you wander and discover more of who you are, what you enjoy, what you are passionate about and how you want to spend your time, you start to ascend a second mountain. This mountain, however is more about: ü´∂üèæ Being in service to others as a source of satisfaction üß© Operating from a place of values e.g. working with value-aligned colleagues üßéüèæ Ubuntu: I am because we are Second mountain people make a strong commitments to one or all of these things: a vocation, a spouse and family, a philosophy or faith, a community. What mountain are you currently on ‚õ∞Ô∏è?\n\nSpring is a time of renewal ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs the flowers or your career. Just ask Nicole Miller, EarnIn‚Äôs Associate General Counsel (and Minnesota native), who cherishes the growth spring brings‚Ä¶ What about spring do you find most inspiring or rejuvenating? Spring is my favorite season. Growing up in Minnesota, which has very long and very cold winters, spring was always an exciting time. People were in good spirits and we would wear shorts and sweatshirts on 40-degree days! Even now, living in California, I love the blooming flowers, the longer days, and the return to more sunshine after the rainy season. It‚Äôs hard to stay inside when the sun feels like a warm hug! What advice would you offer for the season ahead? Get outside as much as you can, while the weather is mild. Watch the trees budding, listen to the birds chirping, and enjoy some fresh spring strawberries and cherries. Why should someone consider working at EarnIn? The people here are great and really focused on making a difference in everyday people‚Äôs lives. Everyone I work with is kind, funny, collaborative, smart, respectful, and helpful. We all want EarnIn and its mission to succeed, which leads to great teamwork and creativity. Plus, there are a lot of opportunities for career growth and development. If change is in the air in your career, check out the opportunities with Nicole and the rest of the EarnIn team on our careers page: https://bit.ly/48iksmZ #LifeAtEarnIn #EarnIn\n\nThe 100 Miles of Dialogue‚Ñ¢ continues, most recently on a 4-mile walk with Tammie Leftwich. We walked in the Nations starting at Office Evolution Nashville, the place where we first met and my current office space. Tammie was a rock for me during the COVID period when I would come into the office waive, talk from a distance, and then head to my safe space, the closed office. Our conversation covered many topics, but here are a few that stand out to me now: - #Kindness - A warm smile backed up with such a helpful service approach can really create the path for a relationship. - #Diversity - People often find commonality amongst each other when they have a sense of being at home. - #Friendships - We have new opportunities for friendship in each chapter of our lives. It‚Äôs just making the time. - #Initiative - We have opportunities that require effort or even small commitments. Each of us has lost people that we wish were close to now. If you have the chance, take the walk. - #Smiling and #Laughing - If you don‚Äôt have either where you spend your work time, get access ASAP. - #Listening - We all have stories that we want to share, find a story buddy. - Life Conversations - Co-working spaces while centered on work can create an opportunity for affirming conversations and chance encounters. - #Connection - Being out in nature can present a really unique opportunity for getting to know one another.
