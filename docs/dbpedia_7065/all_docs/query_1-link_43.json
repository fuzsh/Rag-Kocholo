        "text": "Chase Budinger’s bid for a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics came to an end Monday.\n\nThe former Arizona basketball star-turned-pro beach volleyball player lost in the Round of 16. Budinger and partner Miles Evans lost to Norway’s Christian Sorum and Anders Mol 2-0. Budinger and Evans dropped the first set 21-16, then lost the second set 21-14 to the defending Olympic gold medalists.\n\nBudinger and Evans were one of two pairs from Team USA to advance to the knockout stage of the beach volleyball tournament. The duo made it the Round of 16 by way of winning a “Lucky Losers” match on Saturday, beating a team from Australia 2-0.\n\nAfter falling short at the Olympics, Budinger will continue to compete on the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball tour.\n\nThe 36-year-old Budinger turned pro in beach volleyball after a seven-year career in the NBA. He played for the UA from 2006-09."
