        "text": "I’ve happened onto a new process with poetry and I want to share what I’m learning from it. When someone finds a use for a poem of mine, I take that as a signal that the Universe wants me to pay attention to the poem myself, and to learn something new from it. Always there is something new. I may have had something in mind when I first wrote the poem, but other people see different things in it. And so might I in this moment. Things I’d not seen before. Here’s my most recent example of that practice.\n\nOut of the blue, I got an e-mail from a stranger named Justin Wise in the UK with a link to a half-hour podcast that he and colleague Lizzie had done, about my poem Fire and what it suggests to them. Justin was reflecting on his habit of piling on more work. And Lizzie who is three weeks into motherhood, sees the poem as guidance and encouragement. I'm delighted (it's always a gift to know that our work in the world has been of use, near or faraway). The words of the poem are my own. But I'm curious about their take on it. So I listen.\n\nYesterday, a friend was searching for a poem to share with people who are training to be coaches—life coaches not football coaches. (Although come to think of it poetry for football coaches might be a good thing.)\n\nAs I thought about it, I realized that when I need coaching, myself, (which is fairly often) it is usually because I am feeling stuck, confused, mired in.\n\nAnd what came to mind for me were these words by the farmer poet Wendell Berry:\n\nOften, I find myself stuck in an old way of seeing things. Or fearful of the way things are unfolding around me. Seeking a path forward. Not seeing one. The poem below (prompted by the kaleidoscope which I keep on my bookshelf) emerged in a gathering in my living room as friends and colleagues explored their own role in leadership development. It reminds me of the need for breathing space, a chance to “turn” the kaleidoscope of images, to seek and practice new ways of seeing, of being wholly ourselves.\n\nMy friend Mennie Scapens in New Zealand wrote the message that follows—about Spring and possibilities. I found her words and her questions for us very thought provoking. I asked if I might share them with you—making Mennie my first “guest blogger”. Thanks Mennie!\n\nSpeaking of opening our minds to possibilities—note that Mennie wrote this in October which is springtime in New Zealand.\n\nTime magazine recently ran a piece on all the factors that contributed to the closing of Ringling Brothers Circus. Not the least of which has been the rise of a different kind of circus:Cirque de Soleil. While I've been fascinated with the ascent of Cirque, I am\n\nhaunted by a photo that accompanied the Time magazine story--a photo of the empty Ringling Bros circus circle with the lion tamer and lion together in what could only be described as an embrace. A last embrace."
