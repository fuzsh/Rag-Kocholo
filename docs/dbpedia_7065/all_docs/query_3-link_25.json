He is a philanthropist, activist and co/founder of Adopt the Arts a 501c3 Non- Profit for music and Art in k- 6 public schools in LAUSD\n\nThank you so much for joining us! What is your “backstory”?\n\nWe started our charity 7 years ago and have been working within the public school system at K-6 getting music and art to kids in LAusd during the school day. We’ve done over 1 thousand guitar donations as well as other instruments like Keyboards, Drums and any other instruments the kids need.\n\nWe pay our teachers and have created a curriculum of modern music as well as classics and jazz to give our kids a well-rounded history of music and art.\n\nWe’ve done partnerships in Art with IFAW teaching kids about animals and the environment.\n\nCan you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your career?"
