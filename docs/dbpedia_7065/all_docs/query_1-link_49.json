        "text": "Ever since I was born, I was drawn to nature, the sea, and the ancient’s wisdom and energy. This is exactly how numerology entered my life. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the science of numbers found me and not the other way around. One day, I was literally knocked over by a huge book about numerology in the library and, as I am similar to a kitty, therefore curious, I took it home with me. The new-found knowledge helped me understand myself better. And the rest is history.\n\nFast forward to today\n\nI am constantly improving and nurturing my knowledge, discovering new layers of deeper meanings. It is my opinion that these are lifelong processes that should never end. I’m not looking for an easy path, but the right one. I don’t like definitions because they limit us, so, I avoid them. Tags such as author, TV host, coach, counselor, motivational speaker, internationally renowned numerologist are just tags. Each of us is much more than a label. To say I have been a professional numerologist since y. 2003 sounds so cold.\n\nSo, in simple terms:\n\nWhenever I have the opportunity, I help, whether it is a fellow human being or an animal in need. I want to contribute to a better life today for Indigenous peoples who are still being subjected to genocide. Our Mother Earth needs our attention and immediate change, otherwise, it will be too late for life as we know on this beautiful planet. Describing me without mentioning our mother nature, animals, Indigenous human rights, and environmental warnings would not describe me. As much as I am able to, I am involved with grassroots organizations, such as IEN, It takes roots, even the UN.\n\nBack to numbers\n\nMy path started in Slovenia and soon crossed the borders. I have been professionally collaborating as a teacher of numerology for new practitioners as well as being a speaker, personal coach in the USA and Spain. Today I am said to be the most respected numerology expert in Slovenia, trusted by celebrities and those in need of advice. I host my own TV show every Monday evening. My articles are published by all major media outlets of Slovenia, and I love to (as much as time allows me to) communicate with people around the world.\n\nTo me, we are all related and equal. I will treat you no different than I would treat Jennifer Lopez.\n\n“In lak’ ech, Hala ken”\n\n( “I am you, as you are me” or “I am another you, as you are another me” – Mayan)"
