In 1995, a group of committed families in the Roanoke Valley took on a “God-sized task” when they sought to develop a new school of academic excellence committed to a Classical curriculum. They desired a school that would incorporate a Christian, biblical worldview, within the context of a non-denominational and independent setting. In 1997 the school became a reality, opening its doors to 47 students in grades six through eleven, in space leased from Virginia Heights Baptist Church in Historic Grandin Village. The following year, under the leadership of Head of School Chuck Evans, the school graduated its first class and expanded to 60 students.

Samuel P. Cox became Head of School in 2001, and with the board of directors, made the decision to add the K-5 grammar school and to hire Diane Kelly to develop this school division. Steady growth in enrollment to 96 students led the board and administration to decide, in the summer of 2003, to move the campus to Cave Spring Baptist Church in southwest Roanoke County. The new location provided larger classrooms, a gymnasium, cafeteria, and room to establish a grammar school. In the fall of 2004, the grammar school opened with 79 students, and with 108 students in the middle and upper divisions, enrollment reached a record of 187 students.

In 2005, we broke ground on twenty-seven acres along the Blue Ridge Parkway in southwest Roanoke County. We opened our doors in August 2007 to a new building and enrollment of nearly 300 students.

Peter G. Baur, former head of Westminster Academy in Memphis, TN, was hired as Head of School in 2014. With increasing enrollment, staff now number 50 full- and part-time employees. Programs of academic excellence continue to be developed. Humanities, Science & Technology, and Fine Arts prepare students for the rigors of college-level work. Athletics programs have expanded with some teams competing at the national level.
