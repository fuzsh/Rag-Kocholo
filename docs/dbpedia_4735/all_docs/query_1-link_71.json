        "text": "We believe there is only one true God, the Creator and sustainer of all things, who eternally exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are one in essence and unity, yet distinct in person and function, and are commonly referred to as the Trinity, or the tri-unity of the Godhead. (Gen. 1:1, 26; Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19).\n\nWe believe that the Father is the first person of the Trinity, and He is the source of all God is and does. He is the designer of creation and the author of redemption. (Gen. 1:1, 3-27; John 10:29; John 12:49; 1 Cor. 8:6).\n\nWe believe the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, proceeding from the Father and Son, and equal in deity. He is the giver of life (the One through which Jesus gives eternal life), the agent of inspiration and new birth, the restrainer of sin and Satan, and the One who lives in and sanctifies believers. (Gen. 1:2; John 3:5-8; John 6:63; John 14:16, 26; John 15:26; 2 Cor. 3:6, 17; Acts 5:3-4; Rom. 8:11)\n\nWe believe the Bible, comprised of both the Old and New Testaments, though written by men, was supernaturally inspired by God so that all that its words reveal are the true revelation given to man by God. In the original manuscripts (recorded by men, inspired and directed by the Holy Spirit), it is inerrant and authoritative in all matters because it reveals the truth from God. We believe in a closed canon of Scripture, beginning with Genesis and ending with Revelation. We understand that not all translations today reveal the intended message from God to mankind. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 3:15-16; Deut. 4:2; Deut. 12:32; Rev. 22:18-19).\n\nWe believe that each person can be saved only through the work of Jesus Christ, specifically by accepting His gift of salvation through repenting of sin and placing faith in Jesus alone as Savior. (John 14:6; Eph. 2:8; 1 John 1:9; Rom. 10:9-10; Acts 2:38; Col. 1:14).\n\nWe believe the Holy Spirit indwells all who are saved, conforming believers to the likeness of Jesus Christ. Every believer is responsible to live in obedience to the Word of God, which includes separation from sin. (John 20:22; Rom. 8:15; 1 Cor. 2:12; John 14:17; 1 Cor. 6:19; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor. 5:17; 2 Cor. 6:14-18).\n\nWe believe in the imminent return of Christ. We affirm that believers will be caught up in the air to be with the Lord, followed by a great tribulation period upon the earth. To end the tribulation and save the remnant of Israel, the Lord Jesus will return to establish His earthly kingdom for a thousand years. After that, the unsaved will be raised and judged according to their works and separated forever from God. The saved, having already been raised, will live on forever in fellowship with God. (Rev. 22:7, 12, 20; 1 Thes. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-57; 1 Thes. 1:10; Matt. 24:3-51; Dan. 12:1; Rom. 11:1-29; Matt. 25:31-46; Rev. 19:1-21; Rev. 20:1-15; Rev. 21 & 22)."
