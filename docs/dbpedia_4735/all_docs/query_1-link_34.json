        "text": "Phil and Catherine Dow and their two daughters, Emma and Sophie serve as the Headmaster at the Black Forest Academy (BFA) in Kandern, Germany. Black Forest Academy is a Christian school whose students are made up primarily of children of missionary families serving abroad. Previously they served for twelve years at Rosslyn Academy in Nairobi, Kenya. God recently led them to this new work in Germany. The Dows sum up what their work means at BFA by saying, “We feel like the work that God has called us to at Black Forest Academy is the culmination of everything He has been doing in our lives to this point. We can’t imagine a more significant Kingdom role than the one that we get to play at BFA – both in discipling and developing the next generation of global Christian leaders and in supporting missionary work in some of the most challenging places in the world, by educating the children of these missionaries.” Please keep the Dow family in your prayers as they advance the gospel through their ministry in Germany.\n\nIf you would like to support Phil & Catherine separately from BRBC’s regular budgeted giving; you may donate online at their website https://www.dowsatbfa.com/, or read their blog posts.\n\nJoe and Denise Holman, former pastor and wife of BRBC, became missionaries to Bolivia in 2006. After 15 years in Bolivia, the Holmans have moved to Ghana (January 2023). As always, evangelism is a priority. But their primary focus in Ghana is the training and discipleship of national pastors, evangelists, and church planters. This involves teaching courses in seminaries and Bible Schools, speaking at conferences and preparing twice weekly radio broadcasts. Pray for their adjustment to a new country and that their two teenage girls will settle in well.\n\nMike pastors a local church; La Iglesia de Baratillo; as part of a mission effort under the auspices of Vida Nueva Ministries. The ministry is diverse and includes discipleship of their local church body; homeschool seminars; and publishing a Spanish language homeschooling magazine.\n\nThe Richardsons were called to Mexico in 1994 and BRBC began supporting them shortly thereafter. Their passion is to evangelize and disciple in Spanish-speaking countries. They live in Arteaga; a very rural and rustic mountainous area of Mexico. It is a few hours drive from McAllen; TX; where they get their mail.\n\nIf you would like to support Mike and Pam separately from BRBC’s regular budgeted giving; you may donate online at Vida Nueva Ministries.\n\nLuke is a general surgeon at the Bach Christian Hospital; while Nancy is a nurse and does ultrasounds for female patients.\n\nBach Christian Hospital is an outreach of TEAM; which describes the ministry in the following way:\n\n“BCH was established to promote spiritual; mental and physical wholeness for people living in the mountainous regions of northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Its services are offered regardless of status; religion; gender; race or income. Since its earliest days BCH has provided medical care for people living in the underserved valleys of Kaghan and Kohistan.\n\nIf you would like to support Luke & Nancy separately from BRBC’s regular budgeted giving; you may donate online at the TEAM website:\n\nhttps://team.org/regions/asia/ pakistan\n\nThe Pakistan Children’s Rescue is a direct outreach to the unsaved children in the worst of Pakistan’s ghettos – the brick kilns. The project’s primary content goal is to expose the children to God’s salvation, by bringing them, and when relevant their families, out of the brick kiln ghettos over a multi-year process with the goal to be totally self sufficient at the conclusion of three years. The center will be foster caring for 10 boys initially and hope to be able to look after a maximum of 15 boys.\n\nFor more information, pictures, and a video click HERE.\n\nDr. Ambrose serves the people of Pakistan in many ways. One way he serves is at the Bach Christian Hospital as not only a physician, but also the medical superintendent. Another ministry founded by Dr. Ambrose is Healing Journeys Foundation which is working on a small scale, but in a really fruitful manner through medical mission and compassionate serving. Their medical outreach in the outskirts of Faisalabad is a ray of hope for so many in the area who otherwise can’t afford a trip to the hospital. Medical grounds are the best way to gather people to provide them the Word of God. Salvation is preached directly and indirectly through their medical work. The children’s center at Lahore, also founded by Dr. Ambrose, is effectively nurturing 8 boys from the brick kilns. Whenever he sees those boys and remembers where they came from and what situation they were in when he first met them, his heart is filled with joy and gratitude. He feels that those boys are the fruit of his ministry. All of them are growing not only physically, but spiritually as well.\n\nFor more information about the Pakistan Children’s Center, pictures, and a video, click HERE.\n\nSmyrna Ministries International is an organization dedicated to praying for and financially assisting persecuted Christians in the Muslim context throughout the world. Smyrna partners with Christian ministries in nearly 20 countries throughout the Muslim world.\n\nThe passion of Smyrna Ministries is to 1) provide tools that will help you prayerfully intercede for Christians who are being persecuted under Islam; and 2) serve the persecuted Church by providing our international partners with the materials and funds they need to minister effectively.\n\nFind out more at smyrnaministries.org\n\nBRBC is privileged to be connected with a number of national missionaries through Smyrna Ministries.

We partner financially, in prayer, and in one-to-one communication. The faith of these extraordinary brothers and sisters has tangibly blessed us and helps to build up our faith.\n\nSteve counts Blue Ridge Bible Church as his home church in the U.S. He has been ministering for many years as a single man to the French population, in Normandy, France. Steve’s primary emphasis is to reach the French populace with the Gospel. Because of France’s history of revolution connected with the church, it is very difficult to engage them in spiritual conversation. The average citizen typically turns off anything related to religion. So by friendship development, avenues for sharing the Gospel are sought. He also hosts groups of American college-age students at the center to introduce them to the French culture and customs. Over the years, BRBC has sent several short-term mission groups to Normandy to participate in the center’s work, and future groups from BRBC are in the development stage by the BRBC Global Outreach Committee.\n\nIf you would like to support Steve separately from BRBC’s regular budgeted giving; you may donate online at Chez Vous Normandy, or sign up to receive email updates at https://chezvousnormandy.org"
