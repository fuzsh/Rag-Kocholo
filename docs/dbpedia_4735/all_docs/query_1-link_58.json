        "text": "What are the academic requirements for Vox?\n\nAt Vox School of Discipleship we like to say we value credibility over credits, but that doesn’t mean that credits are not important to us. We simply realize that while some students may excel in the classroom setting, they can still have challenges outside of the classroom. Conversely, while some students excel in vocational life, they may not excel in the classroom. All that to say, we do still factor academic performance and GPA values into admittance decisions, but we do not have a specific GPA threshold for who is admitted and who is not. Instead, we evaluate each student’s capacity to be successful at Vox School of Discipleship on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOur learning environment has proved to be beneficial to some students who historically haven’t done as well in the classroom because we provide a combination of classroom instruction, hands on experience, and great adventure. However, it should also be noted that in order to attain transferable credit for your coursework at Vox, students must be able to meet the academic requirements of each course.\n\nWhen is the deadline for application?\n\nThe sooner the better! We accept applications until our subsequent year's class is full. Once our class is full, we create a waiting list of students to fill any spots that may open up prior to move in.\n\nIf you don’t choose to do Vox for credit, do you still get to do the same classes?\n\nClassroom instruction is a vital element of our goal to help students gain clarity and understanding for who they truly are and what God has called them to do. Therefore, if a student elects not to accept credit for their coursework, they will still be required to participate as if they were receiving credit. Additionally, these students will be unable to use federal student aid to help pay their tuition.\n\nCan I come to Vox for a visit during my Junior or Senior year?\n\nAbsolutely! For more information on scheduling a Vox Visit, click on the button below.\n\nDo I apply to Vox and Columbia International University (CIU)?\n\nStudents apply to CIU after acceptance to Vox is completed, and we will walk you through that process.\n\nIs Vox School of Discipleship denominationally affiliated?\n\nVox School of Discipleship is a non-denominational protestant evangelical Christian gap year school. We have partnerships with multiple Bible believing ministries and churches that share our ethos. Those ministries range in denominational ties, but they are all Christian ministries. Our students come from all different backgrounds. By looking at our partnerships, our curriculum, our students, and where and how we serve - one can get a good picture of our Christian values. If there is any one particular topic or position that is important to you we would love to talk about it more. Overall, our goal is to develop clarity around who God is and what he is doing through the work of His Son - Jesus - and the indwelling presence of The Holy Spirit, who you are in Christ, and the part you play in God's story. We do this through bible-based instruction, hands on learning, serving, and adventure -all of which is carried out against the backdrop of a Christian worldview.\n\nTuition & Fundraising\n\nWhat does tuition cover?\n\nTuition covers full program costs. This includes all college credits/tuition, all textbooks, room and board (i.e. residence and meals), and travel costs for ALL trips. The only additional funds a student may wish to bring would be for spending money while off campus or for incidentals. Incidentals might include coffee, movies, off-campus meals students elect to check out for, personal snacks, hygiene items, etc. Tuition for the 2023-2024 school year is $27,600.\n\nWe’re concerned about money.\n\nIn our Introduction to Personal Finance, Economics and Ethics course, our President Josh Pedersen shares with the students that money is simply an “agreed upon storehouse for value.” We believe that Vox School of Discipleship is an extremely valuable experience for those God calls to participate. We also believe that God is a provider and will be faithful to those he calls. For that reason, if money is a concern for you, creative financial options are available, including fundraising, third party financing, and payment plans. Additionally, because of our partnership with Columbia International University, all the student aid that would be available to you at any other public or private institution is also at your disposal. If money is one of the only elements holding you back from something you feel God is calling you into, please contact us by clicking on the button below.\n\nStudent Life\n\nCan I bring a vehicle to Vox?\n\nYes. Students are allowed to bring their vehicle and leave campus when there is no scheduled programming on nights, weekends, and over breaks.\n\nCan I have a job while I attend Vox?\n\nBecause of our full schedule at Vox School of Discipleship including classroom instruction, hands-on experience, community service, and approximately one week of travel per month; students are unable to have normal jobs while attending Vox. It is logistically challenging for students to be reliable employees in a normal job setting with the full schedule we have at Vox School of Discipleship. However, students will have the opportunity to work with our partner ministry Look Up Lodge to earn a bit of extra spending money by picking up shifts when our schedule allows.\n\nWhat type of facilities do Vox students live in?\n\nVox School of Discipleship uses resident housing provided by our ministry partner Look Up Lodge. Look Up Lodge is a non-denominational Christian camp located in Travelers Rest, South Carolina. We are privileged to have access to a beautiful lakefront campus on 230 acres of land in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Students currently use two dorm-style facilities with shared bedrooms and bathrooms. Central to our core curriculum is the importance of living in Christian community and dorm-style housing naturally encourages the process of developing Christian community.\n\nDo Vox students have breaks for holidays during the school year?\n\nYes. Vox School of Discipleship follows a schedule very similar to any other college or university. Students have three full days off for Thanksgiving (plus the weekend), three weeks off for Christmas, and one week for spring break.\n\nWhat type of meals do Vox students eat?\n\nMeals and meal preparation are essential skills to life and because of that we incorporate meal planning and preparation into our curriculum. Approximately half of the meals are prepared by our partners at Look up Lodge, the other half are prepared by our students. With the guidance of Vox staff, students are assigned to teams, given a budget, and tasked with planning, purchasing, and preparing meals for the student body on a rotational basis.\n\nCan Vox students go home on the weekend?\n\nYes. Students are free to go home or off campus over the weekends. We encourage students to find an appropriate balance in taking weekends away from Vox to help them build deep Christian community in order to maximize their experience at Vox School of Discipleship. We help facilitate this healthy balance at the start by keeping students on campus (with the exception of significant events, like weddings) for the first several weekends to get them in the swing of things, then encouraging weekends to continue as usual. Additionally, on a few weekends over the course of the year, Vox has scheduled activities or trips so home visits or weekend check-outs are not possible in those instances.\n\nWhere do Vox students attend church?\n\nAt the beginning of the school year, Vox staff introduce students to four partner churches in our area. After those introductions are complete, students choose to go to one of those partner churches or request permission to attend another church. As part of Vox School of Discipleship, students need to attend a local church regularly and submit written reflections of their experience at their church on a weekly basis.\n\nDo I have to be an avid adventurer to attend Vox?\n\nNo. In fact, most of our students do not have much experience in adventure, but just a big appetite to adventure and learn. We give you that opportunity and we make sure that you are 100% safe doing it.\n\nAre Vox students more likely than others to become summer staffers at Look Up Lodge?\n\nNo preferential treatment is given to Vox students when it comes to the hiring of Look Up Lodge summer staff.\n\nHow many students participate in Vox?\n\nCurrently, Vox School of Discipleship has 12 male spots and 12 female spots available each year for a total of 24 students.\n\nWhat is the cell phone policy?\n\nAt the onset of the year students commit to exempting from their phones during 1) official Vox programing and 2) on all trips, whether adventure or service based. This in part helps eliminate distraction but most largely enhances our student’s experiences and accelerates their ability to engage, absorb, and make the most of this extraordinary experience. Other than those slots of time, healthy device practices are allowed and encouraged.\n\nCan friends/family come visit?\n\nFamily and friends are welcome to come visit students and can even stay at Look Up Lodge if space allows! Students are asked to verify details with staff prior to family or friends arriving.\n\nDo we have access to the outside world?\n\nYes! In fact, we encourage students to use their free time and weekends to explore the upstate of South Carolina and Western North Carolina.. The city of Greenville is consistently voted a top tourist destination. Additionally, the upstate of South Carolina and Western North Carolina have all sorts of great hiking, biking, camping, and scenic destinations to explore."
