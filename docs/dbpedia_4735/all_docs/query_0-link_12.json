        "text": "Updated November 21, 2023\n\nAlabama Christian Academy is a college preparatory school founded by the Church of Christ in 1942.\n\nAre you ready to discover your college program?\n\nI want my\n\nIn\n\nFocusing on\n\nRankings of the Best Christian High Schools\n\nIn this article, TheBestSchools.org showcases what we regard as the 50 best Christian high schools in the United States. This is not a ranking—the order of schools is alphabetical.\n\nIn selecting Christian high schools for inclusion on this list, we used the following criteria:\n\nCoeducational day schools (no boarding schools)\n\nAcademic excellence\n\nExtracurricular richness (fine arts, athletics, social activities, etc.)\n\nGeographic and demographic diversity\n\nChristian faith taken seriously.\n\nIn compiling this list, we took into account reviews by parents and students, especially if several negative reviews underscored the same concern (unchecked bullying, for example).\n\nWe thought that geographic and demographic diversity was important to this list because we wanted to highlight the best in Christian secondary education across America.\n\nIn other high school articles at TheBestSchools.org, we have tended to put a premium on academic excellence and rigor (see, for instance, “The 50 Best Public High Schools in the U.S./” and “The 50 Best Private Day Schools in the United States/”).\n\nBut for families with students at Christian high schools, the overriding concern is to provide a rounded education that gives due respect to academics but refuses to idolize it, instead always holding faith at the center.\n\nThis article attempts to capture what is best and paramount for Christian high school education in America.\n\nBest Christian High Schools in America (arranged alphabetically)\n\n1. Alabama Christian Academy\n\nMontgomery, AL\n\nWith nearly 1000 students in Pre-K through grade 12, ACA is a college preparatory school founded by the Church of Christ in 1942. With an emphasis on college preparation and an active spiritual life, students begin each day with chapel that varies in format, but with aiding the spiritual maturation of the students as its goal.\n\nAll students have a daily Bible class. Frequently after chapel, students break into smaller groups for Bible study and discussion led by a faculty member or with select juniors and seniors who are members of SALT (Student Action Leadership Team) and were previously trained as small group leaders. Ninth and 10th graders can be members of LIGHT, which prepares them to become members of SALT. They receive training at Camp Chandler during a weekend retreat.\n\nStudents participate in a variety of community service projects, including Eagles for Christ Day where high school students go out before Thanksgiving and work with community agencies and groups. Bible teachers plan service opportunities throughout the year to continue this mission, as do the athletic teams.\n\nSeveral AP classes are offered, as well as honors classes and dual-enrollment classes, through Faulkner University. Band, choir, art, and theater are offered as electives.\n\nStudents participate in a variety of sports, including golf and a bass fishing team that qualified to compete at the State level. In 2014, ACA had one male athlete sign with Auburn University and a female athlete sign with Texas A&M University. A female golfer—a junior—won the Greater Montgomery Open and an ACA senior was named a National Merit Finalist.\n\n2. Archbishop Carroll High School\n\nWashington, DC\n\nFounded in 1951, ACHS combines faith and duty in a college preparation program that prepares students for life as a Christian professional. ACHS has always been an integrated school, accepting students of all races and religions. At its founding, ACHS was four years ahead of the Supreme Court who did not declare segregated public schools to be unconstitutional until 1955.\n\nIn 1989, three diocesan high schools were closed and merged with ACHS, which today enrolls more than 600 students.\n\nThe school provides a Writing Center to assist students in improving their academic and creative writing. The Freedom Writers are a group of students who stay after school working to improve their academic writing through the use of portfolios that chart their progress. A Poetry Slam allows poets to read their work aloud. Carroll poets visit local grade schools and hold writing workshops with younger students in a program called Young Poets to Young Poets. The school also produces a literary magazine, So It Shall Be Written.\n\nAn International Baccalaureate Diploma program is available that is a two-year course of study in seven areas. The IB diploma program also requires 150 hours of Creativity, Action, and Service. Some colleges will grant college credit to IB diploma holders and others actively recruit those with an IB diploma.\n\nACHS does not make community service mandatory for graduation; however, students who do not complete their mandatory community service hours are ineligible for extra-curricular activities in clubs or sports.\n\n3. Asheville Christian Academy\n\nSwannanoa, NC\n\nACA serves children in grades 6 to 12. The school is split into middle school (6–8) and upper school (9–12). Students in the upper school attend a leadership retreat if they are student government representatives or class officers. All students in the upper school may attend an overnight service retreat where spiritual teaching is punctuated by community service projects.\n\n“Winterim” term is from the end of February to the beginning of March, during which time students participate in a variety of learning experiences like foreign missions or local internships. The possibilities are quite broad, but for international or national travel, early planning is necessary, so students are encouraged to register for their Winterim term at the beginning of the school year. Students do not need to leave home, however, in order to find enriching experiences during Winterim. Classes not offered during the regular school year are offered during this interval.\n\nStudents take field trips and overnight trips throughout the school year to enhance the curriculum. At the end of the school year, the upper school classes spend the day at Camp Cedarcliff having a day of fun and games.\n\nAn after-school EXCEL program is available for enrichment, offering sports, fine arts, and academic offerings in math, science, technology, and world languages. The PASS (Programs for Academic Support and Success) program strives to assist struggling students or students who have unique learning challenges.\n\nACA strives to help all students achieve academic success while developing a biblical worldview. Acquiring a biblical worldview does not occur solely in the classroom, however. From class trips and small groups who meet in faculty homes, to service retreats and class trips students are taught not just how to learn, but how to live as a child of Christ.\n\n4. Barrington Christian Academy\n\nBarrington, RI\n\nAlthough a small school, BCA provides a quality Christian education in a town of a little over 16,000 people. In addition to providing a spiritual refuge for children K–12 in Barrington, the school is attended by international students from South Korea, China, and Vietnam. International students live with families who volunteer to bring foreign students into their homes, and most foreign students graduate from BCA.\n\nHigh school students at BCA take four years of math and English, three years of science and social studies, four years of Bible and earn two full credits in fine arts (over four years), P.E., and a language. Electives include various concentrations of religion and Bible, college preparation/independent study, choir, robotics, accounting, business law, nutrition and wellness, psychology, health, theater, various art classes, and woodworking. Seniors may take painting, art history or Senior Studio. AP courses are offered in history, chemistry, and English.\n\nChapel for grades 6–12 are held on Tuesdays from 8:30-9:15, when students are addressed by guest speakers, faculty, musical groups, or visiting missionaries, as well as BCA students. Chapel is also live-streamed through High School Cube–so anyone can watch it!\n\nStudents have the opportunity to take private piano lessons, participate in intramural sports or with one of 18 interscholastic teams, and participate in an instrumental or guitar ensemble, as well as in other clubs and activities.\n\nBCA teams have won league championships in HS Girls Basketball and HS Baseball. Other interscholastic sports include soccer, basketball, softball, baseball and track and field.\n\nIn addition BCA has a notable high school choir that has been on two traveling tours and participates in the RI Music Educators Association competition each year.\n\nService projects include a wide array of activities that allow students to discover their personal gifts. These projects include building homes with the Perkins Center in Jackson, Mississippi, working with My Brother’s Keeper in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and delivering furniture to families in need, assisting with Christmas store preparations at the Providence Rescue Mission, and many others closer to home. For two years now BCA students have also traveled to Dominican Republic for a week-long mission trip, working with the Good Samaritan Hospital in La Romana.\n\n5. Berean Christian School\n\nKnoxville, TN\n\nA K–12 school, Berean offers a faith-based academic program with daily Bible classes and weekly chapel programs. Students participate in service projects, including high school students ministering to the lower grade students.\n\nA fall retreat offers students the opportunity for fellowship and to grow spiritually while setting the tone for the school year. Students can participate in the creation of the yearbook, as well as the drama, music, band, and art programs.\n\nStudents are taken through an academic program that stresses excellence with a biblical worldview. The curriculum is aligned with state benchmarks and national standards. Berean does not offer football, softball, or baseball; however, Berean does have a co-op arrangement with Gibbs High School so that students may participate in those sports. Berean offers swimming, basketball, soccer, and volleyball.\n\nThe SOAR program works with students with special needs to help them achieve success and come to experience their full potential. It is an all-day program, separate from the rest of the school, with professional support from an educational psychologist and learning specialist.\n\nBerean is accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The school is a ministry of Berean Bible Church and is also a member of the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association.\n\n6. Bradford Christian Academy\n\nHaverhill, MA\n\nBradford Christian Academy provides rigorous college-preparatory academics customized to each student’s strengths, gifts, and challenges in an environment that nurtures faith.
