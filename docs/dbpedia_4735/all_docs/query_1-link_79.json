The curriculum consists of three years of study in Theology, three years in Philosophy, two years in English Language and Literature, two years in Classical or Modern Language, two years in History, one year in Political Science and Economics, one year in Mathematics and Natural Science, and 4 years of “Education for Life” career preparation coursework.\n\nThe College’s Front Royal campus overlooks the Shenandoah River with scenic views of the neighboring Blue Ridge Mountains. Students from over 45 states and 7 foreign countries are attracted to the College’s Catholic family atmosphere and its dedication to the restoration of a truly Catholic culture.\n\nThe College offers two daily Masses; daily Confession, Rosary, and Eucharistic adoration; and celebrates together many liturgical and cultural feasts."
