        "text": "Established in 1845, Limestone University is a non-denominational Christian institution founded on the principles of the liberal arts. Located on the site of a former limestone mining quarry in Gaffney, South Carolina, Limestone has been referred to as “The Rock” for countless decades.\n\nYour support, now more than ever, is needed to transform our Saints athletics facilities, elevate the student-athlete experience, and enhance the gameday atmosphere on our campus. Our dedicated Saints deserve the amenities necessary to thrive in their sports, while remaining focused on their academic aspirations. Limestone University is competing to attract talented student-athletes from our region, across the nation, and around the globe. Providing an exceptional student-athlete experience is critical to our recruiting, retention, and development of championship teams – and that will require exceptional support from LimestONEnation.\n\nTogether, we will “Protect The Rock.”\n\n“Protect The Rock” isn’t just the battle cry of fiercely competitive Saints.\n\nIt’s a promise to provide our student-athletes with access to unrivaled facilities that will help them achieve their full athletic potential while maintaining their academic pursuits. Limestone’s athletic teams are vital to our enrollment and financial sustainability, while also being a tremendous source of pride for our students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, and fans.\n\nWe look forward to partnering with even more shareholders and the larger Saints community to elevate Limestone University to even greater heights."
