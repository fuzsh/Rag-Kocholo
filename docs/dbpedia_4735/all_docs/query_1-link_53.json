        "text": "What To Expect\n\nAt New Life, our weekend services are an opportunity for you to connect with God as well as other believers in a casual, inviting atmosphere. Our services include contemporary worship often blended with older hymns, a relevant message, and a time of ministry and prayer. We offer children’s ministry , birth through fifth grade, at all of our services. When you visit New Life for the first time, make sure to stop by our welcome center—just outside the Auditorium—after the service to pick up a small gift, talk and get to know more about us.\n\nOur Mission\n\n“Building Relationships, Transforming Lives”\n\nWe believe we are called to be in relationship with God through faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Only through our relationship with God, can we ever truly be in a proper relationship with others.\n\nWe believe It’s through relationship with Him, that our lives are transformed. As we yield to the truths of God’s word our lives are transformed to the image of Christ Jesus. We bring the mission full circle by reaching from Blue Ridge to the ends of the Earth sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ and teaching these truths of His word as we go."
