        "text": "I disagree with Mr. Bauerlein's take on this. I am fairly involved in K-12 Catholic education, and the constraint in my experience is not decent faculty candidates. Good K-12 teachers do not need masters level degrees to be effective in the classroom - many students with bachelors degrees from The Cardinal Newman Society-list-type Catholic colleges have sufficient substantive preparation to teach in a classical environment. They may need coaching in the art of teaching, which they may or may not get from a masters degree. Mr. Bauerlein says, \"Lots of donors are out there, too, angels who recognize the needs and understand the long-term impact of multi-year formation in the Catholic tradition.\" Really? Where? There may be some, but in my experience the vast majority of big donors to Catholic schools are still supporting business-as-usual diocesan schools, most of which are indistinguishable from public schools in terms of curriculum and culture. I am not opposed to more graduate (and undergraduate) programs for good Catholic educators - and there are many more programs out there than Mr. Bauerlein lists, albeit not specifically advertised for \"classical\" models (Augustine Institute, University of Mary, Benedictine College, Ave Maria University, and Franciscan University of Steubenville to name a few). But credentialed or no, many, many good educators teach for a year or two and then walk away because schools cannot pay them a living wage. THIS is the pinch-point to a true renaissance in Catholic education today.\n\nAs I consider my and others' experiences and observations of Christian higher education, two things come to mind. - Christian colleges and universities often cannot compete with larger institutions when it comes to salary. However, they absolutely could with benefits such as leave. There is no reason Christian institutions should not be leading the way when it comes to parental leave, vacation, mental health, and sick time. Right now? The opposite is true for many organizations. - Christian institutions need to focus on internal communication. Despite the smaller size of many of these schools, information often does not flow freely. The facts back up the truth that organizations with intentional internal communication strategies, seeking to establish cultures of symmetrical communication, cultivate more committed, loyal, and creative employees. Christian higher education is valuable and to survive, it needs to lead the way with compassionate and Christ-like attitudes toward their faculty and staff. If these higher learning institutions truly mean to model Christ, quite a few could begin by treating their employees as neighbors, communicating with, supporting, and trusting them.\n\nLegaciesâ€¦why do we remember people for what they have done? Because legacies are what allow us to move forward and keep our goals in mind. As I think about people who inspire me to continue the work I do, I canâ€™t help but remember who inspired me. Dr. Spann is a legacy so many people talk about in my circle. She taught us how to teach but also how to respect those we teach. When I think back to what I learned as a young adult, I think back to the stories shared with me by my professor, Dr. Spann. I still go to her at times for advice or to share what is working today. Even in those times she shares tidbits that remind me of my purpose in special education and the work and purpose for what we do in our field. Legacies remind us of what we work towards being. We learn from them, apply what we learn from current research , and hold ourselves accountable. We want the best according to those legacies but also based on what we are learning as an intellectual community. Legacies have inspire us to be more! What are we doing to work towards a legacy?\n\nFrom the Future of Education is Evolution: To this day I can recite (only) two facts about my required World History class from my undergraduate degree. 1. The Catholic Church discouraged laymen from reading the Bible on their own. 2. Erasmus, Calvin and Martin Luther encouraged laymen to read the Bible on their own. Neither my BA in Elementary Education nor my MA in Language, Reading and Culture mentioned this information nor did they mention the idea that the beginning of 'reading' could play such an important role in present-day READING. Yet, it seems pretty obvious that our schools also come from one of these two ideologies: We'll tell you what we think the texts says or you tell us what you think the text says. Which do you prefer?\n\nThe horrors and injustices committed by polite and civilized white society against Black slaves are not one iota less criminal than the holocaust against the Jewish people by Nazi Germany. The coverup of that history is a crime. The criticism of those who bring it forward is a crime against humanity. Because the current economy wastes more wealth than it distributes, we could close racial, gender, and other disparities faster than the Sharing Economy created millions of jobs and billions of dollars of new wealth in only a couple of years.
