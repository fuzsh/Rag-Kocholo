        "text": "Family Serve Day is a designated day where our students, parents, teachers, and staff join together in teams to serve others throughout our community. As we unite with our families to develop true servant-leaders, our prayer is that service becomes a lifestyle for our families at MPCS. We believe if families serve together, they are able to grow closer to God together. Through this initial day of serving, perhaps our families will continue their service together throughout the year at one or more of these ministries.\n\nListed on this page are all of the locations to which we will be sending teams to serve. When you click on a location, you will find a link to the ministry's website where you can read more about the ministry. Also included in the dropdowns are the hours of service any age limitations, and ways in which that team will serve. When registration opens simply click on the registration button, and you will be linked to a sign-up page. If the team still has openings, you will be guided through the registration process.\n\nRegistration will open to all lower school families on March 18 to allow families with younger children to pick sites suitable for their younger children. Registration will open to all MPCS families on March 21.\n\nAll families will receive a link to our Sign Up Genius on the designated date (March 18 for lower school families and March 21 for all families). You will sign up for a site by selecting the number of family members who will be serving with you. After the registration process has closed, you will receive information from the MPCS staff member who will be leading your chosen site. You will also receive a DocuSign, which will be required for most locations.\n\nYes, a parent or guardian can sign a waiver for their child when they register online to serve with another family. The other family must be willing to take responsibility for your child and transport your child directly to and from the site (not MPCS campus).\n\nIf your child does not go with friends, your child can be transported to and from the MPCS campus to Camp Gideon, our off campus \"student-only\" site. We also have several on-campus, student- only sites: MUST, CHOA distraction bags, Campus Clean Up, Stadium Clean Up, Dog Leash Project, Teach One to Lead One, and Keep Cobb Beautiful.\n\nParents will be responsible for drop off and pick up from MPCS campus at the appropriate time for the on-campus, student-only teams.\n\nParents must register their own student. Students serving without a parent will either choose between the available on-campus sites or Camp Gideon.\n\nCamp Gideon is a designated off-campus Family Serve Day for which transportation will be provided. Bus times for Camp Gideon are 8:45 a.m. departure from the MPCS campus and 12:00 p.m. parent pick up at the MPCS campus.\n\nStudents in grades PK-2 will have a half day of school on April 26. No after school care will be offered on Family Serve Day. Families with younger students who will be serving with their grades 3-12 students will need to choose a Family Serve Day site that allows for pick up of younger students. There will be no After School Care or EAZ on Family Serve Day.\n\nFamily Serve Day Early Dismissal Times\n\nPK/TK and Kindergarten, 1st-grade, and 2nd-grade students with preschool siblings will need to be picked up at the cottage at the following times:\n\nPink Carpool: 11:30-11:45 am\n\nTan Carpool: 11:45-12:00 pm\n\nWhite Carpool: 12:00-12:15 pm\n\nAll other K-2 students (who do not have preschool siblings) will need to be picked up at the Dining Hall area between 12:00-12:15 pm."
