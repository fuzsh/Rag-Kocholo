We are training students to become disciples of God who are awakened and attuned to His beauty, goodness, and truth. It means that students are taught according to the Trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric), which emphasizes that as children develop cognitively, they learn differently. It means our students are developing skills that are essential in higher education and throughout life – independent scholarship, critical thinking, logical analysis, and a love for learning.\n\nOUR SCHOOL\n\nPRE-K\n\nK\n\nGRAMMAR\n\nSCHOOL\n\n1-6\n\nUPPER\n\nSCHOOL\n\n7-12\n\ndive deeper into the WCA community\n\ntestimonials\n\nhear what our community has to say about wca\n\npodcast\n\njoin our head of school and principals as they explore the distinctives of classical christian education\n\npublished articles\n\nWCA articles highlighting the building blocks of a classical christian education and its results"
