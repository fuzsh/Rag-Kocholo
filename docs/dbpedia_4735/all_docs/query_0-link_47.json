We offer a unique learning environment based on God’s holy word, teaching students to think well, serve with love, and seek God’s will for their lives.\n\nOUR SCHOOL\n\nEquipping Students with Christian Character\n\nAt ECA, we believe that developing the hearts and minds of students to be life long learners with Biblical foundations is paramount. Through our Classical Christian curriculum students are achieving high academic success as well as cultivating a personal relationship with our Savior and Lord. High School students even have the opportunity to earn college credits through our Dual Enrollment partnership with Colorado Christian University.\n\nPre-Kindergarten\n\nOur Pre-Kindergarten program provides a fantastic place in which children learn the love of Christ, practice important social skills, and develop a love for learning. 2-day, 3-day, and 5-day programs are available.\n\nElementary/Grammar\n\nKindergarten – 5th grade Grammar school builds the foundations of Classical Christian learning. Students focus daily on the word of God in all subjects. Classroom structures support students as they learn to love the Lord, be a great friend, serve others, and follow Jesus all in an academic structure that highlights the natural development of children as learners.\n\nMiddle School/Logic\n\nLogic level instruction for 6th to 8th grade focusing on the natural development of middle school students to see the world through a critical lens. Structured classroom discussion, in depth research, introduction to debate and logic, and exploring Biblical foundations in history as well as literature solidify the fundamentals and principals of students being equipped to pursue their purpose in Christ.\n\nHigh School/Rhetoric\n\n9th – 12th grade students participate in a wide variety of courses designed to emphasis the Rhetoric level of learning. Biblical worldviews are foundational to all courses including history, literature, science, and math. Students are preparing to be persuasive in their faith as they step into the world beyond ECA. Dual enrollment through Colorado Christian University offers students an additional option for earning college credit while taking ECA AP and Honors courses.\n\nThe Collegium Study Center\n\nEvangel Christian Academy hosts the Collegium Study Center for Homeschool Families. Since the early 2000’s, Collegium has been partnering with homeschooling parents for Classical Christian education. High quality instruction and curricula engage students at all levels. Classes are available several days per week for students of grades 2 through 12. Tuition costs are about $750 to $1,000 for each student per semester and varies dependent upon the age and course-load of the student.
