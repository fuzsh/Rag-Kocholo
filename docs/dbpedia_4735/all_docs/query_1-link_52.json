        "text": "What is YMCA Christian Values Conference (CVC)?\n\nThe YMCA Christian Values Conference brings together young people who have graduated from 8th grade to 12th grade from across the country. The conference is held in July at the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly in Black Mountain, North Carolina. The conference includes 5 days, 4 nights.\n\nCVC builds the skills and support system teens will draw on to tackle challenges and opportunities throughout the year, from school and extracurricular stressors to pressure that comes from peers and social media to home life challenges and rewards.\n\nYou do NOT have to be a YMCA Member to attend, nor do you have to adhere to any specific religious group or affiliation.\n\nThe setting cannot be more beautiful, surrounded by views of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nCVC MISSION\n\nOur Mission is inspired by John 17:21, “that they all may be one.” At the conference, we promise to:\n\nCreate a diverse atmosphere that is welcoming to all\n\nExemplify sound moral beliefs & emphasize the importance of being an example to peers on and off the mountain\n\nProvide positive, consistent discipline\n\nProvide a safe, positive, Christian environment\n\nProvide caring adults who are dedicated to the spiritual, mental, and physical growth of all teens\n\nProvide active steps in spiritual growth\n\nSupply positive life skills for teens\n\nCreate diverse, unique, challenging activities that encourage continued participation"
