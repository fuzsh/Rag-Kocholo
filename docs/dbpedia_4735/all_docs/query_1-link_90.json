        "text": "Not so surprisingly we Christians do have a role to play in God‚Äôs Kingdom Building. Are you spending more time critiquing others than sharing the Gospel? Is it easier for you to give suggestions to fellow Christians but remain quiet towards non-believers? Then today's YouVersion Devotional will inspire you to learn about: üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá ‚úùÔ∏èThe Call of Every Christian‚úùÔ∏è In the book of 1 Corinthians, the apostle Paul uses metaphors that were part of their culture to communicate essential truths. Paul relates the work of evangelism to a farmer's work in the field: \"So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.\" 1 Corinthians 3:7 Paul's message is clear: while every Christian is empowered with the task of evangelism, it is ultimately God‚Äîthe Holy Spirit, who grows the seed of faith in an unbeliever's heart. This means others' response to the gospel is not on us as believers; our responsibility is to faithfully share the good news of eternal life. But, if we're honest, many of us Christians keep our faith to ourselves. There are people who are ready and willing to hear and respond to the gospel message of Jesus Christ‚Äîthe hope of eternal life. And God wants to use us. He wants to use you! Today, right where you are‚Äîin your job, in your neighborhood, in your family, and in your friend group‚Äîeverywhere you walk with others, God wants to bring the good news of Jesus Christ. And you're never alone in this call. The Bible says that God promises His Spirit will be with and lead you, giving you the right words to say as you step out in faith (Matthew 28:20). So take a moment and consider what next step you can take to begin sharing Jesus with others. Prepare yourself to have conversations about Christ with your neighbors, coworkers, or friends. And ask God to give you courage, so that the good work He has started in you might also take root in others. #beblessed #God #TheFather #JesusChrist #HolySpirit #simplistictheology #witness #theGoodnews #theGospel #SharingYourFaith\n\nBusiness and Faith: Walking in Christ‚Äôs Path In the realm of business, we are called to walk a path that reflects the teachings of the Lord and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. As we engage in our daily endeavors, it is vital to remember that our actions should mirror the deep introspection and adherence to the principles of morality, justice, and righteousness that the Bible teaches us. ‚ÄúSeek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you‚Äù (Matthew 6:33). This scripture reminds us that in all our pursuits, including our business ventures, our primary focus should be on aligning with God‚Äôs will and demonstrating trust in His word. Through the lens of Christian philosophy, we understand that our work is not merely a means to an end but a form of worship and a testament to God‚Äôs favor in our lives. The theology of work suggests that our labor is a reflection of our partnership with God in His creation, and through our businesses, we have the opportunity to showcase God‚Äôs love and the transformative power of repentance. Evangelism in our professional life is not about overt proselytizing but about living out the Gospel through our actions and decisions. It is about being a beacon of God‚Äôs light, guiding others towards the path of salvation and eternal life beyond this world. As we conduct our business, let us do so with the integrity and love that Jesus exemplified, knowing that ‚Äúthe righteous shall live by faith‚Äù (Romans 1:17). Let us encourage one another in this journey, sharing how the application of biblical principles has not only brought success in our ventures but also a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment in serving the Lord through our work. #GospelTruths #Faith #SoundScripture #Morals #Atonement\n\nOh Christian, don't be carried away! In the midst of our fast-paced, ever-changing world, the seductive whispers of the world can mislead us and we may find ourselves caught up in the pursuit of wealth, prestige, or fleeting happiness, neglecting our spiritual growth and neglecting our relationship with God. Here are some signs that we might be drifting away from our true purpose: 1. Prioritizing earthly matters over spiritual ones. When your time, energy, and resources are increasingly directed towards worldly pursuits, leaving little room for prayer, worship, and service. Matthew 6:33 2. Seeking validation and fulfillment from the world. When you find yourself chasing external approval and comparing ourselves to others, neglecting the internal peace and joy that come from faith. Galatians 1:10 3. Losing sight of our values and principles. When the temptations of the world leads you to compromise your morals and make choices that contradict our Christian beliefs. Romans 12:2 If you find yourself in this situation, it's not too late to refocus your attention and re-align your life with God's will. Here are some steps you can take 1. Go back to the place of prayer. Reconnecting with God through prayer and quiet reflection can help you identify areas where you are straying from the faith. Revelation 2:5 2. Let nothing move you. Don't be easily moved by the things of the world. They're temporary and in a few years, they will make way for newer inventions. Acts 20:24 3. Be Patient. One of the best things you can do for yourself as a Christian is to have patience. God's promises over you will come to pass no matter how long it takes. You only need to keep doing his will and be patient. Proverbs 16:32 #ChristianLiving #Faith #focusongrowth #church #Jesussaves #biblestudy\n\nThe book God's Greenhouse poses the question, \"Is our church a spiritual greenhouse that grows strong Christians?\" Most churches are not. This hands-on transitional tool uses skits, handouts, teaching AND a small greenhouse (the ladies will beautify your auditorium with flowers) to re-acquaint stagnant churches with their biblical purpose: the Great Commission of world evangelization and discipleship. 15 Spiritual Laws is the sequel to God's Greenhouse. The first book explains \"who we are and what we do.\" 15 Spiritual Laws explains \"why we keep doing it.\" This book, the simplest of the four, should be read by your workers (not merely staff) once a year to keep them on track. You may order discounted bulk orders for your workers directly from the author by writing pdcpastort@gmail.com. Sanctification: How God Creates Saints out of Sinners is the deepest of the four books and perhaps the only one of its kind on the market. It explains all three phases of sanctification: Positional (salvation), Practical (Christian growth) and Perfection (the believer's final glorified state). A detailed scripture index is provided in the paperback. God Speaks--Today! explains not only how God is revealing Himself to modern man but also what God has said. God's opinion truly matters! These books are available in both e-book and paperback formats. Godsgreenhouse.net provides spiritual growth resources for the disciples of Jesus Christ. Tom pastored Baptist churches for 37 years before recently retiring to do interim work (currently serving as interim pastor at North Dayton Baptist Church) and continue writing spiritual growth materials including on-line daily devotionals. #christian #religion #baptist #biblestudy #jesus #god #spiritual #ministry #preach #pastor #deacon #elder #evangelism #transition #discipleship #greatcommission #missions #abwe #garbc #sbc #pcc #bju #dayton\n\n(From our Wednesday Newsletter on Facebook (https://lnkd.in/g-rUqFBq) The 22nd Parable of Christ Jesus \"The Wicked Tenants\". Matthew 21:33-46 Theology: In Matthew 21:33-46, Jesus tells the parable of the wicked tenants to convey profound truths about God's kingdom. A landowner plants a vineyard, leases it to tenants, and goes on a journey. When he sends servants to collect the fruit, the tenants mistreat and kill them. Finally, the landowner sends his son, thinking they would respect him, but they conspire to kill him, seeking to seize the inheritance. This parable reflects God's dealings with Israel. The vineyard represents God's people, the tenants are the religious leaders, the servants are the prophets sent by God, and the son is Jesus. The rejection and killing of the son foreshadow Jesus' crucifixion. The parallel of this parable is found in Isaiah 5:1-7, where God's people are likened to a vineyard that yields wild grapes. The imagery of a vineyard symbolizes God's care, and the expectation of fruit signifies righteousness. Israel's failure to produce good fruit leads to judgment. The application extends beyond Israel. In Ephesians 2:20-22, believers are described as living stones in God's spiritual house, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus as the cornerstone. Matthew 21:33-46 serves as a warning against rejecting God's messengers and, ultimately, His Son. It underscores the consequences of spiritual disobedience and the importance of acknowledging Jesus as the cornerstone of our faith. As believers, we are called to bear fruit, recognizing the authority of Christ in our lives, and ensuring that our actions align with God's kingdom principles.

God has not forsaken you nor left you alone; He is with you. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è Even though we Christians are mocked, we still can demonstrate God's love and truth. üôå #ChristianStrong #FaithOverFear John 14:6 English Standard Version 6 Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Today‚Äôs YouVersion Devotional is about: üèÉ‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úùÔ∏èRun Your RaceüèÉ‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úùÔ∏è We all know it - life isn‚Äôt easy. Sometimes challenges can arise that are so difficult we may want to throw in the towel. Whether it's an overwhelming circumstance, the demands of family life, or the pressures of work, it can feel like it's just too much. When we find ourselves wanting to quit, the book of Hebrews gives us a powerful encouragement to hold onto: \"Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.\" - Hebrews 12:1 NIV ‚ÄúWitnesses‚Äù refer to believers who have gone before us, those whose lives are a testament of faithfulness to God. Their presence reminds us that we're part of a larger story, a legacy of faith that spans generations. This scripture also urges believers to \"throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.\" Hindrances may be easy to see, such as sinful distractions that hold us back from fully running after God. They may also be internal, like fear and shame. Whatever form they may come in, we throw them off. And yet, we don't just throw off things that entangle us and sit down. \"...let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.\" The call is to keep moving forward, no matter how tough the journey may seem. Guided by grace and fueled by faith, we press on.#beblessed #God #TheFather #JesusChrist #HolySpirit #simplistictheology #runtherace #perseverance\n\nSetting a Good Foundation ‚Äì Committed Relationships. The Apostle Paul begins by giving us 3 committed relationships every Christian should have. The first is found in the words, ‚ÄúPaul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.‚Äù Paul tells us two very important things about himself ‚Äì who he is, and what his purpose is in life. Have you ever thought to yourself, why am I even here on earth? What difference am I making in anyone else‚Äôs life? These kinds of questions come when we do not have the stability we need in our relationship with Jesus. Let‚Äôs look at Paul‚Äôs words. He says he‚Äôs an apostle. How could he be an apostle when he didn‚Äôt even believe in Jesus until after Jesus went back to heaven? Only Jesus‚Äô disciples were called Apostles. Do you think Paul ever felt undeserving of that title ‚Äì especially since he had killed Christians before his conversion (see Acts 7:58)? He gives us the answer, not only for himself but also for us. He is an apostle, by the will of God. Just as Paul‚Äôs purpose is found in the will of God, so is ours. God‚Äôs will, as we will see in the lessons of this study, gives us the best stability our lives could possibly have. The next relationship needed for a stable life is in the words ‚Äúand Timothy, our brother.‚Äù God never meant for any of us to live this Christian life by ourselves. We need others for fellowship, for encouragement, to keep us accountable before God. Timothy was a personal friend of Paul‚Äôs. Choose your close friends carefully for they will influence your life and your actions. Proverbs is full of warnings about false friends, see 22:24-27 as just one example. The third relationship God designed us to need is other people. But we need those who are the same as us. Such people we find in a God-fearing/worshiping church. They are those who are followers of the will of God, those who are brothers and sisters in Christ. We come from every nation and every tribe. Together we find grace and peace from and in Him. *What are the examples of false friends in Proverbs 22:24-27? *Who is the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù in Proverbs 18:24?\n\nThe church in Thessalonia is being persecuted for their devotion to Christ. We find Paul addressing the church in the book of 1 Thessalonians and he has the challenging job of uplifting these believers in the midst of their harassment. Have you ever felt defeated before you even began? Or you think you‚Äôre doing the right thing and don‚Äôt see the fruits? Instead you‚Äôre getting the opposite results of what you were hoping for? Sometimes we want to handle life by ourselves. We think we can do it alone. We don‚Äôt want anyone else‚Äôs help. We believe our way is the only way. Proverbs 3:5 reminds us to trust in the Lord with our whole heart and not to rely on our own understanding, since we are flawed, biased, and affected by our past hurts and traumas. In all of our ways, everything we do, we should acknowledge God so that our paths can have meaning, purpose, and direction. Verse 8 of 1st Thessalonians 5 reminds us to have faith, walk in love, and cling to hope despite what life is throwing our way. Paul tells the Thessalonians to comfort and strengthen each other. Be a source of support and encouragement. The scripture says to work with each other and continue to build each other up. The Greek words used here are house builder, edify, embolden and construct. These are what we ought to be doing for each other. 1 Thessalonians 5:11 - Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. The last part of the scripture lets us know that, the Thessalonians are already doing this. Where are you practicing this in your life? How can you apply it to your existing relationships?"
