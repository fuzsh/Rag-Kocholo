        "text": "May 14, 2021\n\nIn recent months, our Admissions Office and Administration have interacted with hundreds of families from a variety of schools and communities as more parents consider a private or Christian school for the first time. Not surprisingly then, we have also encountered an increasing number of inquiries about Wesleyan’s position on a range of cultural issues and current events.\n\nWhile this is not entirely uncommon, the uncertainty surrounding ideological shifts in our culture coupled with the rising tide of state legislatures adopting new worldviews as part of their school curriculum has served to cause considerable concern for these parents.\n\nWe want to reassure you that for 50 years, Wesleyan has faithfully held to a Gospel-centered, Christian worldview. When cultural trends or issues arise that impact our families, our leadership has remained committed to seeking and submitting to God’s clarity from His Word first and foremost. In addition, it has always been Wesleyan’s desire to graduate historically literate students with a biblical worldview—students that understand both the sequence of World and U.S. History and the fortunate blessing and responsibility we all have of being citizens in our country. Each of these principles live and breathe in the foundation of who we are as Wesleyan Christian Academy.\n\nTherefore, as Wesleyan seeks to equip our students to know and embrace Christ and to influence our culture, our leadership team and School Board regularly review and assess topics that may impact Christian education. Consequently, we spend a considerable amount of time talking, reading relevant books together, and making ourselves familiar with a wide spectrum of resources. Like many other Christians and Christian organizations, there are times when it is important to examine topics that impact how we live out our faith, as we have with the biblical definition of marriage, political discourse, and diversity over the years.\n\nEmerging Socio-Cultural Issues\n\nBecause of the rapid popularization of cultural worldviews like Critical Race Theory, which is aligned with social Marxism; the speed with which it has been accepted by some states as law; and the division this issue is causing, we have been asked in recent months where we stand on this movement.\n\nFirst, we all know that the issue of racism has long been egregious and divisive in our society. We believe that a biblical worldview understands the Gospel as the only true solution, not only to the obvious sin of racism and discrimination, but also to all the alienation and hatred that exists between people and that is perpetuated by people who hold these secular worldviews.\n\nAs we face challenges together, we are reminded of Paul’s words to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 1:10, “I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.” Therefore, we wanted to pause and review for you Wesleyan’s convictions on this topic.\n\nJust as we openly and clearly share Wesleyan’s beliefs in our Statements of Faith, including the aforementioned biblical definition of marriage, gender, sexuality, diversity, etc., we believe it is important to address the topic of racism, and more specifically, how it relates to Critical Race Theory, in the same manner.\n\nThe Sin of Racism as it Relates to Critical Race Theory\n\nOur administration and faculty are well read on the nature of intentional division and racism from a biblical perspective. In addition, especially over the past year, we have included the Critical Race Theory worldview and its beginnings in our research. Resources we have found insightful have included (but not limited to):\n\nConfronting Injustice without Compromising Truth: 12 Questions Christians Should Ask About Social Justice, Thaddeus Williams\n\nBrave: By Faith, Alistair Begg\n\nFault Lines, Voddie Baucham Jr.\n\n“Race & Reconciliation”, sermon by Dr. Tony Evans, Oakcliff Bible Fellowship, November 15, 2020\n\nWith all of this taken into account, it is the belief of the leadership of Wesleyan Christian Academy that the Critical Race Theory worldview is antithetical to the Gospel and a Biblical Worldview, as well as our country’s long history as a free democracy. Therefore, we reject the tenets of this ideology and believe it incompatible with our Statements of Faith. Below you will find an overview of why we believe this to be true, alongside what we have taught for decades, supported by Scripture.\n\n__________________\n\nWe believe that the Bible is the infallible word of God. 2nd Timothy 3:16\n\nWe believe in a Gospel-centered, Christian worldview, and we hold views that are consistent in God’s Word. John 3:16-17, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nAll men and women are created in the image of God. Genesis 1:26-27; Psalm 139:13-16\n\nThere is only one race, the human race, created by God and for God, possessing diversity and beauty within it. Genesis 1:26-27; Genesis 2:7; Romans 5:12-14\n\nThe fall has created disharmony and alienation amongst all people; the sin of racism is a result of the fall. Genesis 3, 4; Genesis 6:5; Romans 1:28-31; Titus 3:3|\n\nGod makes it clear that he hates when a person or organization stirs up dissension, or anything that creates division within the body of believers.\n\nProverbs 6:16 and 19, Proverbs 10:12\n\nThe gospel is the only true solution, not only for racism and discrimination, but to the alienation that exists between people that is perpetuated by some in our culture. Ephesians 1:9-10; Ephesians 2:11 – 3:13; Gal. 3:27-28; Colossians 3:9-11\n\nA Christian’s primary identity is rooted in Jesus Christ, not in their political persuasion, class, gender, ethnic or demographic group.\n\nGal. 3:27-28; Colossians. 3:9-11; Philippians 3:3-11; 1 Peter 2:9-10\n\nOur identity in Christ redefines everything about us and all other identities are diminished.\n\n2 Timothy 1:7, 1 Corinthians 12:27, Galatians 3:27-28, Colossians 3:3\n\nThe saving blood of Jesus Christ unites and draws people together from all kinds of backgrounds, cultures and differences.\n\nJohn 17:20-26; Romans 8:17; Philippians 2:1-2; Colossians 1:20\n\nIn the greater body of believers recognized as the Church, and consequently in our school, God has reconciled believers into one lineage as sons and daughters of God where he calls us to unity, peace, and love for one another.\n\nEph. 2:11-3:13; Revelation 7:9-10\n\n__________________\n\nParents, we are humbled that we continue to enroll families like yours who want to partner with us in the upbringing of their children in a distinctively sound, Christian environment committed to academic excellence and distinction.\n\nWe are blessed that parents are overwhelmingly supportive of who we are, what we teach, and the mission to teach our kids “to know and live the truth.” As with any secular topic or worldview, these ideas are reviewed more thoroughly on the high school level so that our students are fully prepared to defend and articulate their beliefs. You can be assured that we do not recoil from critical issues like these as we pursue God’s excellence and prepare your children for their future.\n\nWe cannot say it often enough…thank you for entrusting us with this great privilege and responsibility of teaching your children God’s desire for us to embody the fruits of the spirit found in Galatians 5:22: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control…and to “above all else, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins” (1 Peter 4:8).\n\nOn behalf of the School Board and Administration,\n\nDr. Rob Brown\n\nHead of School\n\n(2009-2022)\n\nA Letter to Wesleyan FamiliesContinuing our theme of Unity in Christ, with full transparency, Wesleyan has always operated as a conservative Christian institution and our standards and beliefs are publicly stated and taught. As a religious 501(c)3 corporation, we do not endorse particular candidates or parties, however, we are allowed and have often taken a stand to support specific legislation that is obviously in alignment with our values such as pro-life, pro-families, pro-religious liberties and expression, and pro-school-choice.\n\nOver the years, our leadership has worked with care to honor the Lord as we seek to provide excellence in Christian education through our focus on academic distinction, servant leadership, Christian community and a solid biblical foundation. By God’s grace, He has maintained our witness as a Christ-centered academy, created and united for His purposes. As we shared in last week’s message, we have all been thrust into operating and responding to the calamities of COVID-19, cultural unrest, and political vitriol; as followers of Christ, we seek to remain obedient to Christ’s calling to unity under His supremacy.\n\nPreserving Our Unity\n\nBelow, the Apostle Paul shares his desire for the Ephesians to seek and protect their unity as followers of Jesus Christ …\n\n“I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.”\n\n– Ephesians 4:1-3\n\nWesleyan’s leadership continuously works to encourage and protect the unity that God has graciously provided the Wesleyan community. Not surprisingly, this can be challenging when there are differences of opinions or beliefs, even amongst followers of Christ.\n\nWhen faced with differences of opinion or beliefs within a body of Christ followers, our approach is very different from that of the world where differences in beliefs are often a matter of the heart—frequently rooted in pride or fear. That said, because we are living in a culture that functions far from respectful discourse and problem-solving, it’s difficult not to be influenced by it.\n\nMany of us are bombarded daily by disparaging dialogue via social media and a 24- hour news cycle. Much of this dialogue is instigated by today’s media, public and private corporations, politicians, and even professional sports figures. But as followers of Jesus Christ, it is our personal and institutional responsibility to guard our words, messages, and hearts against those things that would divide us.\n\nValuing Unity\n\nWith this spirit of unity in mind, Wesleyan has always asked students to refrain from promoting political causes or candidates, waving banners or wearing potentially contentious statements that can unnecessarily create discord and be counterintuitive to the unity and positive family culture found at Wesleyan. By doing this, we hope to teach our students to value others above themselves as God’s Word exhorts us in Philippians, and to encourage healthy discussions around age-appropriate questions without allowing the tone of the world to impact our thoughts or actions, as we noted with the questions in last week’s letter.\n\nIn Proverbs 6:16-19, we are reminded that God said it is detestable for a man “who stirs up dissension among brothers.” This important truth—and conviction—has served and guided our school’s leadership, faculty, and student body for generations. And as challenging as it can be to enforce this value, our school, staff, parents, and students have enjoyed the full blessing of adhering to this truth.\n\nThe Unity of the Gospel\n\nIt is our desire as a school to align ourselves with the authority of God’s Word in all things, and that the body of believers at Wesleyan Christian Academy will set our hearts on the unity of the Gospel as we partner together in the upbringing of your children. We are strengthened and encouraged knowing that in our mutual identification in Christ, there is great hope for our children as they begin to understand the beauty and power of Christian unity.\n\nAt a time when moral and social decline seems to overwhelm the church, Christians can often be vilified. While recognizing real pain and suffering in various communities, our desire is to navigate through these complex issues and teach our children how to love one another with the love of Christ, even when we disagree. We believe that learning these valuable theological lessons is vital to each child’s walk of faith—and to our 50-year-strong mission to partner with parents to equip students to impact the world for Christ.\n\nUnity as Wesleyan’s 2020-2021 Spiritual Life Focus\n\nIn our weekly chapels over these past several weeks, we have expanded on God’s command to Christian unity and have delved into the fundamental truths of the Christian faith. As part of this focus during weekly chapels, devotionals, and discussions, our students have reflected on the best ways to work through potentially divisive issues.\n\nWe are encouraged to see our students find answers to these difficult issues through God’s Word. Although much of the world can quickly assign blame and create discord, we can find answers, purpose, and hope. In the coming weeks, during Middle and High School Chapels, we look forward to exploring more topics with Pastor Deon Parker, our Principals, local pastors and myself including:\n\nUnited with Christ\n\nUnited Against Division\n\nUnited under God’s Authority\n\nUnited in Repentance\n\nUnited against Racism\n\nUnited Against Idolatry\n\nUnited by Grace\n\nUnited in Celebration\n\nUnited for God’s Glory\n\nUnited to Worship\n\nUnited for Empathy\n\nUnited by God’s Call\n\nAdditionally, Elementary Chapel themes will focus on values important to unity such as forgiveness, wisdom, thanksgiving, generosity, determination, contentment, honesty, obedience, and orderliness. We are thrilled to provide our students with a better understanding of who God is and His desire for us as the body of Christ.\n\nA Word About The 2020 Election\n\nAs we approach the upcoming presidential and state elections, we know only one candidate or party can prevail in each office, and some people may be disappointed with the results. Thankfully, as believers, we can encourage one another to remain hopeful no matter the end result because God is sovereign no matter who wins (Job 42:2). We are hopeful also because we are a community built around unity, humility, love, service, and the centrality of the Gospel message. This will not change, no matter who wins.\n\nWesleyan, we are confident that together we can help lead the way to encourage and witness to a hurting and lost world who needs to know the same hope of eternity that we do.\n\nServing our families, for His Glory,\n\nDr. Rob Brown,\n\nHead of School\n\n(2009-2022)\n\nA Letter to Wesleyan Families\n\nWhen Wesleyan was established in 1971, our founders’ and leaders’ heart was to develop a school with a mission: “To partner with families by providing a biblically-based, college-preparatory education so that students will be equipped to serve Christ and influence the world.” Since then, Wesleyan families, alongside our nation, have navigated difficult seasons surrounding events such as the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the Iran Hostage Crisis as well as the Gulf Wars and 9/11—not to mention cities that have experienced unrest, injustices, and violence over the years.\n\nThrough these events and others, Wesleyan’s leadership has treasured the faithful commitment of our families to uphold our biblical foundation no matter what crisis our nation may be going through. This remains true today.\n\nAside from God’s grace and provision, we have enjoyed this blessing due in part to the fact that we purposefully plant seeds as early as the first moment a new family walks through Wesleyan’s doors. Through initial discussions with our admissions office, guidance counselors, and principals, each new family is introduced to the history, culture, and Christian convictions of the school. During the admissions process, we carefully communicate our Mission, Vision, Core Values, and beliefs, and how we choose to practice these principles. In so doing, our goal is to create a unified understanding of what is important to the heart of Wesleyan while introducing standard practices and principles based on God’s word for the entire Wesleyan family to embrace in the daily life of our school.\n\nAs we stand in the midst of three momentous waves of change both caused by and as part of the Coronavirus pandemic, national unrest, and a highly divisive election year, it is as critical as ever that we hold fast to these principles and the biblical foundation and purpose that Wesleyan was founded on so that every child fully embraces what it means “To Know and Live the Truth.”\n\nSeeking God’s Truth\n\nUnderstanding the importance of unity within our community, our leadership collectively works very hard and intentionally to develop close, supportive relationships within the Wesleyan family. We also pay close attention and regularly seek wisdom that is consistent with our beliefs and values as we deal with various issues. It is our desire to teach your children to do the same. But first, they must understand how to apply critical thinking skills and gain knowledge through the filter of God’s word.\n\nFor this reason, one of eight of our Core Values states … “Students will be able to demonstrate their understanding of essential knowledge and skills by the use of critical thinking and integrated application.” This one, in particular, has been at the top of our list since last March. We believe the ability to apply knowledge and critical thinking skills is a vital first step in our students’ walk of faith and to their 21st-century education, as they too will need to navigate through future times of transition and upheaval.\n\nFor Such a Time As This\n\nThe statement above brings us to one very important truth: God has sovereignly and precisely placed each family and staff member here, at this time, with the responsibility of raising, teaching, and equipping our children. As followers of Jesus Christ, we also know that God calls us to unity within the Body of Christ, especially in times when the dominant culture demands conformity to its own worldview.\n\nOur School Board, Administration, and Faculty are convinced that this new environment in which we live requires a renewed focus and resolve to stand firm, to abide in Christ, and apply His Word as we interact with one another and represent Christ to those around us.\n\nWith the purpose of unity in mind, through your support and our shared Core Values, we are determined to help you and your children with tough and necessary questions like:\n\nAre we creating division or building unity in our speech and expressions?\n\nAre our actions making things better or worse?\n\nAre we conforming to the mind of Christ or being submissive to our personal worldview or bias?\n\nAre we looking to our politicians or government to meet our spiritual objectives, or God?\n\nWhat kind of attention are we seeking through social media posts?\n\nIn addition to …\n\nHow do we best show love, respect, patience, and humility to those we disagree with?\n\nHow do we empathize and respond to injustices that plague a fallen\n\npeople?\n\nHow do we create awareness and a safe place to discuss age-appropriate\n\ncultural issues, yet still allow room for respectful disagreement?\n\nHow do we keep our children focused on their faith while the world and much of the media and entertainment industry is focused on dividing and shaming?\n\nHow do we teach to love our neighbors as ourselves while some are hostile to those who display their Christian faith or express traditional values?\n\nHow do we teach our kids to be effective communicators, actively listen,\n\nappreciate differences, offer solutions, and most importantly, being the light in times of adversity?\n\nHow do we best model civil discourse, respecting the law, order, and justice\n\nwhen much of what our kids see and hear from leaders, athletes, newscasters, and entertainers don’t set the example?\n\nAnd finally …\n\nHow do we best ensure that our children do not find their main identity in a\n\nparticular candidate or political party, professional athlete, or any person of influence or social movement … but in Christ alone?\n\nHow do we best model and teach our kids that embracing their design and purpose is our highest responsibility?\n\nThese are all worthy and important questions to ask ourselves as individuals. And as a school committed to partnering with parents to equip your children to influence the world for Christ, it’s equally important that we seek God’s wisdom and truth in these moments and provide a biblical framework and answers to support their solid foundation in Christ.\n\nNext week, in Part II of “Unity In Christ,” we will share specific ways with you that we will continue to walk alongside you and your children as we navigate these days together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Rob Brown,\n\nHead of School\n\n(2009-2022)"
