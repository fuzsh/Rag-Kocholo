Those who pursue a higher life with limitless possibilities.\n\nWe cannot predict your future, just as we could not predict the futures of other great thinkers and doers and creators who have found themselves on our campus. So, we will teach you all we know to be true. You will learn about classic literature and chemistry. Art, music, and physics. The sweet alchemy of a banana and sugar. The twisting trails and towering trees that frame our campus. The constellations over Mount Pisgah.\n\nThe power of friendship. The rewards of being curious and receptive and open. To believe that you belong here—just as you belong everywhere.\n\nIt is a privilege to learn and live in this small and special enclave among ancient mountains, and your role in our community is vital. You will graduate a truer, braver, wiser version of yourself. And what you share with others will be something unique. It will be you.\n\nIn four years, you will teach us more than we could have imagined. You will say the same of us."
