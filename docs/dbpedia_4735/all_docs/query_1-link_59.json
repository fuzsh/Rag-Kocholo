Our mission is to facilitate an environment for children to focus on their academics with support, guidance, and positive motivation.\n\nMost online homeschooling programs and public schools’ requirements state that the parent or other responsible adult will be the students learning coach and an active participant in their child’s education. Often this demands continual delivery of lessons and materials consuming your time and energy, depleting yours and your child’s patience while adding undue stress. We recognize this problem…how can you handle it all? That’s where we come in! Essentially, we partner with you. Atlantic Academic Partners allows you to be in more than one place at a time.
