        "text": "As your little ones get older and you begin thinking about their education, the options for preschools can seem overwhelming! There are many factors to consider such as the curriculum that is being taught, the option for part-time vs full-time, locations, style of education, etc. While we have quite an extensive number of daycares and preschools in Harrisonburg, VA, I have compiled a list solely of local preschools. A preschool differs from a daycare in that a typical preschool day is much shorter than that of daycare, usually just a few hours in the morning or afternoon, though some do last a full day. Preschools have a set curriculum, typically taught by certified teachers, and are usually open to ages 3-5. So, whether you are looking for a church-based preschool, secular school, Montessori school, or an outdoor preschool in Harrisonburg VA, this list will help you find the right fit for your child!\n\nReligiously Affiliated Preschools in Harrisonburg VA and Surrounding Areas\n\n1.
