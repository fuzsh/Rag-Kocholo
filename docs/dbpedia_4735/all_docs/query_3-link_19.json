Exposure to music and song begins at the earliest ages with the Kindergarten Christmas Play. Expression through vocal and instrumental music extends through middle and upper school in formal Choral and Band performances. Trinity offers a superior, multi-faceted band program that provides a variety of musical and performance opportunities. The award-winning Wildcat Pride Marching Band continues their record of excellence, receiving straight superior ratings at statewide competitions. The Middle School Concert Band, the first of its kind in the city, and the Symphonic Band allow students to increase their proficiency through rehearsing and performing concert band literature.\n\nService: Serving others is paramount at Trinity. From the first day of Lower School to the last day of Upper School, Trinity’s focus is on putting others first. Trinity’s school-wide (K3-12) mission project, Change 4 Change (C4C), has donated over $100,000 in the past five years to charitable organizations in Montgomery and throughout the world. Trinity’s junior and senior classes annually serve over 1,100 hours of community service with local organizations, such as Common Ground, Habitat for Humanity, and The Salvation Army. Trinity believes students benefit greatly—both academically and emotionally— from volunteering their time and giving to make the community and world a better place. Therefore, a variety of service opportunities are provided to Lower School students. They practice leadership, problem solving, collaboration with others, time management, and communication. Trinity believes that while completing community service projects, students develop real-world skills that will help them succeed in middle school, high school and beyond.\n\nTechnology: Trinity was the first school in the River Region recognized with this prestigious honor and has now achieved Apple Distinguished School status for five consecutive years. Trinity’s curriculum offers several technology courses, including Coding, Robotics, Broadcasting/Digital Video, College Tech Basics, and Computer Graphics. Dedicated to a learning environment utilizing the tools and resources of the 21st century classroom, Trinity was the first school in the River Region to implement a grade-wide laptop initiative, providing students equal access to technology. Every student in Grades 6 to 12 is issued an Apple laptop for use during the school year. Macbooks and iPads are available for lower school students to use daily in the classroom.\n\nRecognitions: Trinity graduates have received over $35 million in merit-based scholarships over the last 5 years. One hundred percent of Trinity graduates are accepted to post-secondary institutions, with the majority of students attending their first choice of a college or university. Trinity School offers over 34 Advanced Placement (AP) courses and Honor courses. Taking advantage of an extensive amount of AP courses on campus and online, a vast majority of Trinity’s AP students score between a 3 and a 5 on their exams, with many students being able to nearly complete their freshman college studies before ever graduating from Trinity. The Lower School STEAM Studio is inspiring critical thinking in students (K3-5th grade), where they are engaged by stimulating curriculum that increases achievement and creates positive attitudes towards the study of STEAM-related fields—science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics. The Lower School Media Center encompasses a library and an innovation lab, providing project-based learning activities to Lower School students."
