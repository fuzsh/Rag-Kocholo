        "text": "Have you ever wondered how people in the Bible shared the Gospel and did evangelism way back then?\n\nLast week, we looked at our discipline of discipleship and saw that we have the very same Gospel, the very same mission, and the very same power source: the Spirit of God. This week we need to go onward to examine exactly how they communicated that Gospel.\n\nJust as in the Four Gospels, we see Jesus Christ communicating the Gospel, so we see those closest to Him taking that message He taught them and passing it on. What exactly was the way the disciples and the rank-and-file New Testament church members explained the plan of salvation? That is perhaps the most fascinating of the elements of disciple-making that I can think of.\n\nTHE GREATEST EVANGELISM COURSE OF ALL\n\nThere are 22 carefully recorded witnessing events in the Book of Acts.\n\nThese descriptions of the disciples’ witnessing follow the three-plus years of evangelism school Christ had led them through as He trained them to be the Apostles of His Church.\n\nIn the Gospel by Matthew, we find Jesus explaining the Gospel 39x; in the Gospel by Mark, we see Him doing so 10x; Luke has 29x; and the Gospel by John has 24x. So we can say that the Four Gospels have recorded 96 scenes of Jesus Christ, Who came to seek and to save the lost, actually at work presenting the Gospel.\n\nTHE ESSENCE OF THE GOSPEL WE ARE TO SHARE\n\n(ESH-15; 140511AM)\n\nJoin the LAND OF THE BOOK channel to access weekly video releases over the next year totaling 50+ EXCLUSIVE VIDEOS featuring weekly in-depth Bible Study lessons with John & Bonnie.
