We have grown rapidly into a Preschool and K-8th grade school filled with students, faculty and staff who love being in our special community. Our small student to teacher ratio in elementary and middle school helps our teachers meet the needs of each student. The small size of the school as a whole also allows for close interaction among the faculty.

An Arbor Montessori education cultivates concentration, motivation, self-discipline and love of learning in every child. It’s not just what your child will learn, but how they will learn and how they will feel about learning for the rest of their life that makes an Arbor education remarkable.\n\nWe teach them math, science and language so they can thrive anywhere academically. We encourage independence, self-direction and critical reasoning so they have the tools to make good decisions anywhere their life takes them. We teach collaboration, cooperation and peace because we know our children can be agents of change anywhere they go in the world. In addition to an outstanding academic curriculum, Arbor offers art; music; Spanish; a before and after-school program; and an athletic program.\n\nSince 1970, Arbor Montessori has been the flagship of Montessori education in Atlanta.

Our innovative curriculum and highly qualified faculty are preparing students for success in college and beyond. In keeping with our mission of “excellence with honor in the personal and educational experience of EACH child,” Athens Academy offers an unparalleled education and a wide variety of academic, athletic, art, service, and leadership opportunities.\n\nRanked in the top 10 college prep private schools in the state by Niche, Athens Academy serves students from 19 counties across Northeast Georgia. The campus is situated on 152 rolling green acres in Oconee County, just down Highway 316 from metro Atlanta. But a pleasant drive isn’t the only thing Athens Academy has to offer. The faculty have an average of 18+ years’ experience in education. STEM (science, technology, and mathematics) education is an integral part of the curriculum, with programs in media production, robotics, coding, and virtual reality. Every second grader learns to play the violin, and orchestra education continues throughout Upper School. Service and leadership opportunities abound and are embraced by students in all grades. With 20 varsity sports teams and 52 state championships, the athletic program is one of the best in the state. The 90 members of the Class of 2023 earned an impressive $7.5 million in merit scholarships, not including HOPE, and they are currently attending 42 different colleges across the country. The list goes on and on of the many academic, athletic, leadership, and fine arts opportunities at Athens Academy.\n\nBut the stats only paint part of the picture, because the educational experience at Athens Academy is far from “cookie cutter.” The talented faculty is supported by the Learning Support Program, allowing the school to accommodate students with differing learning styles within a family and within the larger community. A differentiated, hands-on learning experience complements a challenging curriculum that prepares students for college and life-long learning.

Our innovative environment builds on their passions, and embraces a strong partnership between family, home, and school, instilling a strong sense of identity and values.\n\nThe Epstein School prepares students to become confident, engaged learners, critical thinkers and committed community leaders who are grounded in their unique Jewish identities. As one of the best private Jewish day schools in the nation, we continually seek to set higher standards for education and have been identified as a United States Department of Education Innovator and were selected as a Microsoft Showcase School.\n\nWith the school’s whole child educational philosophy and unique dual language program, including its integration of advanced technology, creative arts, and athletics programs, Epstein students are provided a well-rounded educational experience.

Our Pre-K through 8th grade school program provides small class sizes and challenging academics in a diverse environment, drawing on the Quaker values of simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality and stewardship to empower our students to go out into the world with conscience, conviction and compassion.\n\nWe believe that all students have within themselves unique capacities for learning and achievement. The learning program provides opportunities for students to achieve their highest academic levels. In a supportive learning environment, students develop their capacities through independent thought, service and responsible action, thereby fostering lifelong learning, self ­confidence and respect for others. We provide a caring, cooperative atmosphere encouraging students to support each other as equals and discourage that which would set one student above another.\n\nThe belief of Friends that individuals must find their own way leads to respect for the faith of everyone. Following the Quaker tradition of meeting corporately in reflective silent worship, an integral part of the school is the weekly meeting where the community gathers in silence to attend to the inner voice of the Spirit. This is a time to reflect upon experience, share thoughts with one another and seek truth.\n\nQuaker values, based in the worth of each person, are reaffirmed in the school by listening and negotiating in the spirit of unity. These same values lead us to strive for diversity among students, families, faculty and staff, the Board of Trustees and in all areas of school life. As students incorporate the value of human respect into their lives, we believe they will take their wisdom and turn it toward social issues that extend beyond the immediate community to the world at large.\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School, PreK\n\n862 S Columbia Drive\n\nDecatur GA 30030-4159\n\nfriends.school@friendsschoolatlanta.org\n\n404-373-8746\n\nhttp://friendsschoolatlanta.org\n\nLocated in historic Chastain Park, The Galloway School is a community where learning is joyful, individuals are valued, and self-discovery is encouraged.

Galloway serves a diverse student body of approximately 770 students in PreK3 through grade 12, representing 618 families in 77 zip codes.\n\nThere is a reason that, among the independent schools in Atlanta, Galloway stands out, with a one-of-a-kind learning model and educational approach that values the intrinsic gifts and identity of every individual. For more than 50 years, our philosophy has encouraged academic excellence while maintaining a student-centered focus. The value placed on the unique qualities of each child is reflected in small classes, personal interaction between students and teachers, and flexibility in planning the best learning approach for each child. Teaching and learning is a community enterprise: students, staff, faculty, administration, and parents are all partners in this venture.\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School, PreK, Upper School\n\n215 Chastain Park Ave, NW\n\nAtlanta GA 30342-3223\n\nadmissions@gallowayschool.org\n\n404-252-8389\n\nhttp://www.gallowayschool.org\n\nHeritage Preparatory School is a PreK-10th grade classical Christian school located in the Buckhead/Midtown area of Atlanta. We are excited to add 11th grade in 2023, followed by 12th in 2024.\n\nHeritage offers a classical education that is traditional, time-tested, and intellectually rigorous. One of the distinctions of classical education is the insistence on presenting students with the great works of Western civilization, masterpieces that span the fields of art, history, language, philosophy, and literature. Thus students come to understand the present and gain perspective on the future through knowledge of the past. A classical education is based on great ideas, great books (including primary sources when possible), foundational truths and principles, and enduring traditions and skills. It holds to long-established standards.\n\nHeritage focuses on the integration of faith and life. Heritage acknowledges Jesus Christ as Lord over all of life and the Bible as the final authority in matters of life and thought. All academic subjects are taught as parts of an integrated whole with scripture at the center. Students are encouraged to become “thinking Christians” and to develop a solid biblical worldview.\n\nDetailed information about our school program can be found by visiting our website at heritageprep.org.

From their vision, Pace Academy was born. We’d like to think that our school community today is exactly what our founders had in mind. With 1,100 students in Pre-First through 12th grade and a 9:1 student-teacher ratio, Pace focuses on developing each child’s passions and strengths through academics, athletics and the arts. But we also understand that education today is more complicated than the three As; it’s about providing global perspectives in the classroom and an integrated experience before and after the bell rings. That’s why we emphasize diversity, inclusion and Judeo-Christian values, and why building character is at the heart of everything we do. Pace students, guided by our outstanding faculty and staff, develop a deep understanding of the world and the people around them. Our students graduate as global leaders who want to be successful, and they realize that true success means making a positive difference. Because of our founders’ ability to THINK BIG, we now create prepared, confident citizens of the world who do the same.\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School, Upper School\n\n966 West Paces Ferry Road, NW\n\nAtlanta GA 30327-2648\n\n404-262-1345\n\nhttp://paceacademy.org\n\nPaideia is a school of around 1,000 children age 3 through 12th grade. Our main campus is in the Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta near Emory University with athletic fields in Avondale Estates. We balance challenging academics with a commitment to the arts, athletics, and service learning, a combination we believe inspires students to stretch to new levels of achievement. Each year, Paideia graduates typically attend over 50 different colleges and universities.\n\nThe school was founded in 1971 by parents who wanted a personal, creative, and intellectually demanding education for their children. In naming the school they chose an ancient Greek word, “paideia” (pie-DAY-uh), the meaning of which reflects the conscious pursuit of a child's total education by a community. In addition to advocating intellectual, civic, artistic, and physical development, Paideia seeks to cultivate the development of a child’s ethical self. We strive for racial, cultural, and economic diversity within our student body and work hard to be a place that embraces students and families from all backgrounds. We approach children as individuals and encourage them to be cognizant of their relative strengths, interests, and dispositions. True to our founding values, parents continue to play an integral role in the governance and life of the school.\n\nWe encourage you to learn more about Paideia--by talking to teachers, students, and parents involved at our school, by exploring our website, by visiting, and by asking questions.\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School, PreK, Upper School\n\n1509 Ponce de Leon Avenue, NE\n\nAtlanta GA 30307-1617\n\nadmissions@paideiaschool.org\n\n404-377-3491\n\nhttp://paideiaschool.org\n\nPINECREST ACADEMY is a private, Pre-K 3 through 12, college preparatory Catholic school, located in South Forsyth, GA, just minutes from Alpharetta, Milton, Johns Creek, Duluth, and Suwanee.

Founded by David Schenck in 1959, The Schenck School is widely regarded as one of the top schools for dyslexic students in the United States. Our strategy is the focused, accelerated remediation of dyslexia, and students typically are enrolled for two or three years before returning to a mainstream school. Unlike other schools, we celebrate when our students leave to further their education elsewhere.\n\nWe have 250 students enrolled in grades Kindergarten through sixth, with a five-to-one student-teacher ratio. Our highly trained faculty use research-based, multi-sensory teaching methods to help students achieve academic success. At the very heart of all we do at The Schenck School is the teaching of reading. Our students are here because they are not strong readers, and we address this challenge every day. Research shows that the most successful intervention for dyslexia is intensive instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness, and our use of the Orton-Gillingham Approach provides this intervention daily throughout all grades. Our reading curriculum also focus on comprehension, fluency, vocabulary, written expression, grammar, and spelling.\n\nWhile reading and writing are central to our curriculum, The Schenck School offers a comprehensive educational program to help students develop intellectually and to prepare them to reenter mainstream schools successfully. Math concepts and skills are taught with manipulative-based programs that emphasize understanding processes while encouraging critical thinking and problem solving. The science curriculum encourages investigation, exploration, and observation. Teachers capture students’ natural interests and curiosity about the world around them through the study of the earth and its diverse regions, our solar system, plant and animal life, and the physical properties of matter and energy. The social studies curriculum helps students understand and value the connection between themselves and others in the community, the country, and the world, as well as understanding the historical context in which they live. In addition to the core subjects, students engage in art, music, technology, library, and physical education classes. The Schenck School has occupational therapists and speech and language pathologists on staff to work with students as needed.\n\nThrough the Parent Education Series and outplacement services, we help parents understand how to advocate for and support their children and guide them in selecting the right school destination after The Schenck School. Our active Alumni Association stays in touch with students and parents and offers different opportunities to return to the School for social and educational activities.\n\nWhile at The Schenck School, students learn to advocate for themselves and to celebrate their dyslexia. They view themselves as smart, independent learners capable of great things. Our mascot is the Phoenix, and our motto is “Read, Rise, Fly.” At The Schenck School, we look forward to the day our students fly away, ready for the next stage in their educational journey.\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School\n\nSpecial focus: Learning Differences\n\n282 Mt.

Our school has incredible access to green space. Because 70% of the land in Chattahoochee Hills will never be developed, our students will always have trees to climb and streams to explore. From the ecological design of our new campus to how we teach our students to be responsible stewards of the land, Terra School honors and reflects these values.\n\nWe offer programs spanning from 8 weeks through 12th grade and extend a warm welcome to all families in search of a school dedicated to challenging lifelong learners. Our goal is to nurture students who thrive in a diverse and ever-evolving world, equipped with resilience, intellectual humility, an ethical compass, and boundless curiosity.\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School, PreK, Upper School\n\nSpecial focus: Montessori/Waldorf\n\n255 Prom Field Road\n\nChattahoochee Hills Georgia 30268\n\nadmin@terraatserenbe.org\n\n770-463-0081\n\nhttps://www.terraatserenbe.org/\n\nFrom pre-K to senior year, Woodward Academy creates opportunities for each child to thrive, whether they excel in math, get inspired by robotics, or flourish in literature and art classes. Our Academy is the most diverse and inclusive independent school in Atlanta where students learn organically from exposure to perspectives different from their own. We immerse our students in intentional programs to teach tolerance, respect, and compassion—all so they can find their unique way into the world.\n\nWoodward is a place for nurturing conversations and understanding. We do that through our 25 AP classes, a renowned Transition Program for students with mild learning differences, more than 100 student clubs and cocurriculars, 75 yearly arts performances, and 18 varsity sports. Our Global Connections Program offers extensive international study abroad programs, and our innovative STEAM programs are woven into the curriculum at every step of the way. A typical Woodward Academy graduating class attends more than 100 different colleges and universities, devotes 5,000 hours to community service, and earns more than $20 million in scholarship awards.\n\nWith two convenient metro Atlanta campuses in Historic College Park and Johns Creek, the Academy is linked by an expansive bus system, carpool, and a MARTA shuttle, servicing families from 20 counties and 100 zip codes.\n\nPlease visit woodward.edu for additional details.\n\n1662 Rugby Avenue\n\nCollege Park GA 30337-2116\n\nadmissions@woodward.edu\n\n404-765-4000\n\nGrades offered: K, Lower School, Middle School, PreK, Upper School\n\n1662 Rugby Avenue\n\nCollege Park GA 30337-2116\n\nadmissions@woodward.edu\n\n404-765-4000\n\nhttp://woodward.edu"
