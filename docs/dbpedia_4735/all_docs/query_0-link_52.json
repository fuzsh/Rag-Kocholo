We do this across multiple locations; our New London and Bedford campuses, and online.\n\nAt Blue Ridge we believe that being the church is more important than doing church. God created us to function best in community, supporting and encouraging one another as we journey through life together. Are you curious to know more about Jesus, wanting to join a group of people who will help deepen your walk with Christ, or find committed followers of Jesus who want to live on mission with Him? We have a place to help you to take that next step.\n\nJust like the rest of Blue Ridge, kids & youth believe we’re here to help people follow Jesus. Everything we teach is based on God’s Word and the Good News that God loved us so much that He sent His Son Jesus, so that we might have a relationship with Him.\n\nWe are excited to have you join us and become a part of our family!\n\nVisit Blue Ridge Community Church\n\nLocation\n\n20957 Timberlake Road\n\nLynchburg, VA 24502\n\nService Times\n\n9:15 am | 10:30 am\n\nThe Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God’s revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.\n\nVisit Calvary Baptist Lynchburg\n\nLocation\n\n118 Davis Cup Road\n\nLynchburg VA, 24502\n\nService Times\n\n9:30 am\n\nAs a church, we meet every Lord’s Day to celebrate our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Our services are simple and biblically saturated so that we are God-centered, not man-centered. Thoughtful contemplation of the Bible and its doctrines, sincere corporate singing, and friendly interaction with one another and our guests characterize our services.\n\nCCF is a reformed Baptist church that treasures the truths of God’s Word. We believe and proclaim the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ as defined in the Bible. We not only believe the gospel, but we also believe the doctrines that the Scriptures teach. We believe that right doctrine leads to right living, so we aim to protect the Christian faith’s core doctrines with our words and our lives.\n\nVisit Christ Covenant Fellowship\n\nLocation\n\n31 Cross Roads Lane\n\nFishersville, VA 22939\n\nService Times\n\n10:30 am | 6:00 pm\n\nEverybody needs a home. A home is where people grow together and learn life’s most important principles. It’s where children are raised, lifelong bonds are formed and love is taught. It provides shelter from outside elements and a place of rest for the weary. It’s where laughter is heard, tears can freely flow and a listening ear is always available. Having a good, solid home is critical for every man, woman, boy and girl. We invite you to our church home this week; you might just find the home that you’ve been looking for!\n\nVisit Crossroads Baptist Church\n\nLocation\n\n7640 Alpine Road\n\nRoanoke, VA 24019\n\nService Times\n\n9:15 am | 11:00 am\n\nOur vision at Fellowship is not centered on a movement or a particular way of doing ministry. Our vision is centered around the person and work of Jesus Christ. We believe Jesus is the only hope for salvation, so we do everything we can to make His name great in the Roanoke Valley and the world. We take a biblical approach to what we think, teach, and believe about Jesus of Nazareth. The apostle Paul writes the following words to the church in Corinth concerning Jesus, ‘And I, when I came to you, brothers did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified’. 1 Corinthians 2:1-2\n\nVisit Fellowship Community Church\n\nLocation\n\n1650 Hooper Road\n\nForest, Virginia 24551\n\nService Times\n\n9:00 am | 11:00 am\n\nAt Waymaker.Church, our mission is to make a way for the “new and deeper” with Jesus Christ. We exist to remove obstacles and build bridges for people to be who God has created and called them to be. To make sure we do this in a manner that honors God and stays faithful to His instructions, we want to anchor Waymaker.Church in the truth of God’s character and commands. As such, this statement sets out the basic foundation of our beliefs.\n\nVisit Waymaker.Church"
