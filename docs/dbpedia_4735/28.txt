…not just how to make a living, but how to live.

New Covenant Schools is an educational community founded in 1991 in the classical, Christian tradition. Unique in its approach among schools in Central Virginia, New Covenant serves about 450 students in grades PK-12 with the finest classical, Christian program of study in the region. The school is fully accredited with the VAIS, and is affiliated with the Reformed Episcopal Church, serving students from more than 60 churches and a variety of denominations. Our campus is located on 50 acres at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Lynchburg, Virginia.

“New Covenant’s unique approach to writing and research built a strong foundation that supported me through college and has allowed me to excel in my career as a Product Manager creating solutions to complex problems.”

“New Covenant Schools gave me the opportunity to be a big fish in a small pond; the smaller class sizes and teacher to student ratio allowed me to grow as an individual rather than be a number. This has translated directly into my current field of work where I am a leader in pedorthic intervention around the greater Lynchburg area.“

“At New Covenant, my teachers encouraged me to share ideas and held my thoughts with respect. Being treated as a peer in conversation with adults who I looked up to has shaped a confidence in my own thinking. This has had a positive impact on every aspect of my life after graduating.”
