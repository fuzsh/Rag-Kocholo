At Blue Ridge Church we have 3 convenient service times each Sunday. Our in person and online (live stream) service times are at 8:30 am, 9:45 am, and 11:00 am. We are located at 1655 Roanoke Street in Christiansburg (Behind Long John's).

The first thing we'll ask of you is simple -- RELAX! You do not have to dress up. The pastor will be in blue jeans. We do not care who you voted for in the last election. And please don't feel you need to pretend to be someone you aren't!

What you can expect at our services:

60-minute services

Friendly people who will help you find your way around

A message that is relevant to your life

Fun, age-appropriate kids' programs: birth - middle school

Great music

Whether you are single, married, single again, married again, with or without children - no matter your past or your present - we invite you to experience Blue Ridge Church.

And in case you are wondering, we are a non-denominational Christian church.
