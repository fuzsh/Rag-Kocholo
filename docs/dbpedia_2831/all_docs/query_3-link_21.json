But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [including] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. And sometimes you learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize because you were careless.\"[3] Based on the lyrics, critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend, The Twilight Saga actor Taylor Lautner.[2][4] Lautner has confirmed these rumors. \"Back To December\" was first released as a promotional single from Speak Now on October 12, 2010, as an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store leading up to the album release.[5] On November 15, 2010, the song was then released as the second single from Speak Now.[6]\n\nCommercial performance[]\n\n\"Back To December\" is one of fourteen songs on the standard edition of Speak Now which has charted within the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100.[7] Upon its release as a promotional single, \"Back To December\" debuted at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 with sales of approximately 242,000 digital downloads, on October 12, 2010.[8] Following its single release, the song re-entered Billboard Hot 100 at number seventy-four on the week ending November 27, 2010.[9] The song has since reached a position of number twenty-five.
