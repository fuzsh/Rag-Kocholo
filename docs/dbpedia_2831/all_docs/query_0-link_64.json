        "text": "Post by snakelady on\n\nI read this list now of the best selling artists, and Status Quo are not even mentioned..? Anyone on the Wikipeida here that could make a difference? At least 118 million albums I recall, sometimes even 120..? en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists\n\nI don't think Quo have sold 118 million albums. They themselves never say 'albums', they say units. So my guess is that the 118 million incudes absolutely everything; albums, singles, DVDs etc (maybe even t-shirts and patches)!!\n\nI heard a quote from Alan recently saying he thought they only sold about 35-40 million albums.\n\nThe most recent figures that have been used for 2-3 years maybe are 128 million.\n\nI've read somewhere that the number includes albums, singles and videos. No idea if that's correct ?\n\nWhy would Alan, who hasn't been in the band for 30+ years know anything about Quo's sales and more so than the actual band ? That figure is certainly founded on less facts than any other number IMO.\n\nFor a band that has been around that long and sold that well in so many countries I'd not say 100+ million is that improbable. They may not sell huge quantities of new material in any one country, but 50 000 in one, 20 000 in the next a.s.o. add up even if it aren't the same big figures the band was used to once. And at the same time hits packages are selling constantly, newer fans add the back catalogue or older ones replace albums, buy special editions and whatever. None of that is enough to make the sales charts for any single one of these, but over 5 decades, two of which generally had big sales figures, I do consider 128 million very probable.\n\nFor some strange reason many Quo fans think Quo were smaller than they actually were and to a degree still are. Maybe to do with the fact that over the last 1-2 decades or so music history has been kind of reinvented and various acts been bigged up - due to reunion tours/gigs ? - while others with a less commercial marketing angle and who've mainly been around all the time or, to a lesser extend, who've long since disappeared completely, dropped of the radar. The media love a good story and xy simply touring once again isn't one. This hyping of reunions or tours/gigs or albums once in a blue moon has a lot to answer for ..\n\nPost by nino on\n\nThe most recent figures that have been used for 2-3 years maybe are 128 million.\n\nAnd when I became a fan it was 118. That was in 2005. So you really think they sold 10 million units in 10 years? No way! Just look at the awards the albums got:\n\nQuid pro Quo as last \"normal\" album got a silver award which means between 60.000 and 99.999 albums were sold.\n\nAquostic got a gold award which means between 100.000 and 299.999 albums were sold.\n\nAnd I can't recall them being awarded anything else outside the UK lately, which means add maybe 50.000 sales from the rest of the world and thats it.\n\nPost by snakelady on\n\nThe most recent figures that have been used for 2-3 years maybe are 128 million.\n\nAnd when I became a fan it was 118.

Only I think that small numbers from many countries and over many years do add up to big numbers as well. And we know the awards are neither accurate nor up to date. Bula Quo charted exactly the same as QPQ in GB, so the numbers sold should be roughly the same too (and with it the award) and some older albums are completely missing from the list despite their chart positions indicating otherwise (from memory RTYD).\n\nYou've mentioned numbers from the UK, although just part of the overall sales. Say Quo sold 50000 Aquostic albums in Germany plus 5000 of the various hits collections plus 500 from all their studio albums each (and I assume that's a pessimistic estimation) - plus say 10000x Aquostic in Holland plus 1000x hits .., same in Belgium, France, Austria, Switzerland and many more countries.. and all that in just one year. Merely small numbers and not enough for an award in any of them, but they add up to a total something. Not millions per year like they used to sell, but millions over a decade.\n\nAnd we mustn't forget that videos are included as well and Quo videos usually sell very well, so that's some 10k/year additionally.\n\nWhat I've no idea is how general hits collections count with merely one or two Quo songs included. If they're classed the same as singles, then that's further sales figures to be added even if the band earns as near as nothing from the rights.\n\nPost by snakelady on\n\nAnd there are the live recordings sold after gigs. They must have sold a lot of these from the reunion tours.\n\nYes indeed, we haven't mentioned the FF material so far. All of it will have sold reasonably well, but again not enough for any one single issue to make the charts. And then there are all the other live recordings from the winter tours, sold at the gigs and online.\n\nIMO it's extremely difficult to add up all these small numbers and come up with something that's even close to accurate. And it'll probably even be the same for the band themselves with that many different companies and business partners involved ..\n\nPost by asthequoflies on\n\nThere were a few topics on this on the other message board, and I agreed really- there is no way Quo are up there with the biggest sellers and the 118 units it more than likely half of that.\n\nQuo sold around 30-40 million units up to mid eighties apparently, they are a popular band in the UK and Europe but since 1986 to present day, are they really on par with international colossal acts like Metallica and Bon Jovi. Metallica have sold 110 million units since the mid eighties, and they are truly international. Any act to sell major numbers has to break America and sell vast quantities, it is just not feasible that Quo have sold that much. From 1986-2017, albums sold - under 5 million, even liberally speaking? They just do not sell albums like Metallica, Bon Jovi, Green Day..etc; all of those acts are around the 100 million mark (that is always units, not just albums). The Stones are on 234 million units but they sold all over the world, particularly in America.\n\nIf Quo sold 5 million albums (doubtful) since the late eighties, did they really sell a further 85 million DVD's and singles in that time?? 85 million?^ A unit = one album, or 3 singles, or a DVD. etc.\n\nQuo for the last 30 years have not been major sellers, you certainly wouldn't put them anywhere near acts like Green Day, Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, Coldplay..etc; common sense tells you that.\n\nQuo's sales, as a band who never broke America and sold in vast quantities is logically nowhere near the biggest acts of our times, they are probably on about 40-50 million. Have no idea where the oft-quoted 118 million comes from, but I'd think it's p.r.; good p.r., but not a kernel of truth to it.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nThe numbers never change. They haven't for years now and the figures are churned out in support of every marketing campaign and gig promotion they get involved in. They won't be 100% accurate but are anyone's? People - lay people - believe this stuff.\n\nTo be fair, Quo have sold a ridiculous number of records in the past, particularly singles. These are 'units' as well I'd have thought.\n\nI honestly wouldn't be that surprised if they'd out-sold acts like Metallica and Coldplay. Not if we go back 40 odd years even given those bands' stateside success. Albums, even successful ones, don't sell in the same volume that they did in, say, the 70's. And these artists do not have the singles success behind them that Quo do.\n\nI'm not disputing that they are much wealthier and more popular in real terms than Quo but the whole shifting units thing might be closer than we think.\n\nPost by asthequoflies on\n\nNot really; I know where you're coming from alright with sales and 40 years, but there were some very good posts on this a few years ago and even links to articles - countdown of top music sellers in history over 80 million and Quo did not make any of the lists.\n\nA good mate of mine had a Dad who worked high up ion the US music industry throughout the 70s and 80s, a unit is not one single; one album is a 'unit' but it takes 3 single sales to make a unit. DVD's and the like are also a unit; so if Quo sold 10 million singles then that is only 3 million units.\n\nTo sell 100 million records you have to have broke the US, there's just no way Quo have outsold Bon Jovi, even given the time they've been in the business. Bands that sell over 100 million are the type with diamond selling albums, 10 million copies or more.\n\nAlan Lancaster is quoted as 30-40 million units up to the mid eighties were Quo's sales, and I would think that's a very good estimate. Quo never sold in the USA, and to be fair, since the mid eighties I would think it almost a certainty that they are not measured anywhere near big sellers; they're just not that kind of band with as wide an appeal.\n\nMainly though, it's just sensical - bands like them who sold big numbers in Europe but never broke America are all around the 40-60 million mark; if you look up the lists on Wikipedia or through music sales websites, acts as popular as Quo were in the 70s with a following still today, and crucially without selling in the USA, they are all of the same level. I would think myself Quo's sales are around 40 million.\n\nPost by asthequoflies on\n\nLol I know what you mean mortified\n\nEven if singles were one unit, quo'a 118 mill would be a tall order. It makes sense when you think of record industry - 3 singles around same price as one album; one unit.\n\nThere was a brilliant 50 page document compiled on Stones last year, after a year or two collating figures; displaying how the total figure was derived. Very well done and a lot of it notated with their sources. Based on actual figures from soundscan and others from 1991 onwards, and from multiple record industry sources pre 1991. They are in the record industry themselves. The album sales made up a large percentage as most studio albums are in the millions, with some near the 10 million mark. Thats what we need for Quo!\n\nPS forgot the example; 2 and 1/2 million singles is 800,000 x 3. Units 800,000.\n\nPost by snakelady on\n\nI still think 120 million \"units\", not albums is easily possible for a band like Quo who have been around for 50 years, when you take into account singles, LP's, DVD's, CD's (inc. remasters etc)and videos.\n\nIf you consider the territories they have been popular in over the years and for how long it soon adds up.\n\nI think they now claim 128 million units.\n\nAnd as per the discussion above, 3 singles equals 1 unit apparently (not disputing it).\n\nAnd as Snakelady usually says, we are talking about sales across the whole world, not just the UK.\n\nI'm sure it's pretty close to be honest. Maybe slightly exaggerated!\n\nYep, it went up from 118 to 128 million within the last 10-15 years (although some sources still quote old figures). Not a lot actually for a band that popular and probably very realistic IMO. Like (nearly) everybody else's their sales figures have severely suffered in the age of illegal downloads. We've known that for a long time ..\n\nPost by asthequoflies on\n\nI really wouldnt think so, 10 million units over last 10 to 15 years, for Quo?? A band may be very popular as a live draw, that may not translate at all into unit sales. Fleetwood Mac sell substantial quantities of their back catalogue, all over the world, and they have not sold 10 million over last decade.\n\nI dont understand the \"theyre so popular so 10 million not a lot and very realistic\" - its anything but realistic lol (no offence meant at all snakelady) ...10 million albums is a huge number and only attainable by the highest sellers over last decade! Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd - extraordinary sales figures throughout career, and only around the 10 million mark over last decade with huge reissue campaigns. There is just no way Quo outselling these acts. Led Zeppelin not reaching the 10m but Quo are? And this the era of declining music sales, so only the biggest international acts sell in these quantities.\n\nLook at QPQ as an example, Quo are popular live act, the album only actually charted in 9 countries, and only for one or two weeks - only three of those were even in top 20. France was No. 157 for example. The album sold under 100,000 to date. This is a very good barometer for their studio albums. The chartings are all online for the studio albums. Only exception was Aquostic, so combined the sales last 10 or 15 years would not be 2 million. DVDs and singles; even very high charting DVDs from Metallica and major sellers over last few years would only top 250,000. I really dont think Quo DVDs outsell them.\n\nThe Stones sell almost a million catalogue albums per year, as do Eagles, Bon Jovi, Metallica..etc. Quo are a hugely popular live draw, always have been, but they really are not big album sellers. You just dont sell millions of albums because youre around a long time and are popular - if you dont sell anything in America you're not selling in the millions like the big acts. Catalogue sales are what propel the artists selling over 100m; Qup's back catalogue was essentially out of print for a long time. Twofer's were available; the budget issue, the actual studio albums were only reissued a decade ago. And they would sell nowhere near the levels if the Zeppelin and Floyd reissues, which sold between 5 and 10 million.\n\nQuo's chartings and album sales tell the logical story. I would think 2 million would be fairly accurate. There was a link to Quo on the biggest selling lists in the 40-60 million category few years ago. The link was on the old board and prompted the discussion as many believed the \"120 million album\" hype; if I locate that link will add it here."
