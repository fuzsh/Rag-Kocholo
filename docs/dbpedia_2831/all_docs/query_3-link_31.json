        "text": "Fifteen years ago, in October of 2006, the world was graced with the soul-filled R&B album Back to Black by the one and only Amy Winehouse. The album represented the essence of heartbreak, pain, grief, and mental stress, told by an artist who sang every word with pure emotion. The raw passion of this album continues to resonate to music lovers and artists everywhere, impacting and even impacting later musicians such as Adele. Famously known for its hit single of the same name, Back to Black mixes a blend of jazz, pop, R&B, with a nod to ‘60s girl groups. In doing this the album forever carries a taste of nostalgia. That being said, what makes this album truly special is the story of the musician behind it.\n\nComing from a family of jazz musicians, Amy Winehouse was no stranger to the components of the genre. She bought her first guitar at the age of 14, using this acquisition to begin writing her own music and playing with local musicians. While she was signed by her first management company at the young age of 19, they kept her a secret, causing her to later move under the management of Island Records. After the release of her debut album Frank, Winehouse was met with great praise for her soulful voice, writing, and “cool, critical gaze over the music scene”. The album introduced the world to her jazz-induced pop that would soon become internationally acclaimed. After Frank’s release, Winehouse became a bit more reclusive after her first experiences with fame, only keeping up appearances playing pool at pubs. At this time she also began her relationship with her infamous ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil. Winehouse throughout this time developed drug and alcohol addictions, as well as mental health problems. She also faced a lot of ridicule by the British press and found herself in a dangerous relationship with Fielder. During their co-dependent yet on-and-off relationship, he slept with many other women — once even leaving Winehouse for his former girlfriend — inspiring the heated lyrics behind the hit song “Back to Black.”\n\nWinehouse’s pain and experiences were key elements that brought emotion to her work. In an interview featured in the “Amy” documentary, the singer said, “I wouldn’t write anything unless it was directly personal to me just cause I wouldn’t be able to tell the story right or really fill out the song with words because I wouldn’t have done it.” Although given a natural gift for music, Winehouse truly found her passion for the art through her own emotions, using music to wear her heart on her sleeve. Her experiences did not make her; rather, she made herself utilize them. She continued in the interview, “So you know all of it is stuff that I’ve been through and even though some of it is personal in a sad way, you know I would never let it just be that it’s very funny like I’ll put humour, a punch line in a song always.” This was made the most clear to the audience with the release of Back to Black. Winehouse comes across to her listeners with a uniquely crafted brassy voice that transforms any statement enough to pierce the skin."
