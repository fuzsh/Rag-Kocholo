        "text": "For the second day in a row we feature a song written by John Fogerty. When Fogerty wrote ‘Rockin’ All Over the World’ for his second solo album in 1975 he could not have imagined the symbolic significance it would take on approximately ten years later. Here is a brief story.\n\n“Rockin’ All Over the World’ was the first single from the album known as ‘Fogerty’ but Fogerty himself referred to it as ‘Old Shep’ because that was the name of his dog, who appeared with him on the cover.\n\nThe song did not register with the public in the same way as a CCR song. It only made it to #78 on the charts. It took on another life when it was recorded by the English band Status Quo in 1977. Status Quo is a fascinating band that has roots going all the way back to 1962, when they began as The Scorpions, which was changed to The Spectres in 1963. Key members include Francis Rossi who incredibly, has been with them from day one, Alan Lancaster, who formed the group with Rossi in 1962, and remained through July of 1985, and Rick Parfitt, who joined them as part of The Spectres in 1967, and remained until his death in 2016. It was shortly after Parfitt’s arrival that the band changed their name to The Status Quo from their most recent moniker, Traffic Jam, which had evolved from Traffic after a dispute with Steve Winwood’s band Traffic over who had come up with the name first. By 1969 the group agreed to drop the ‘The and they became known as simply Status Quo…Got it? Good! For those of you following along at home the band had three names in the calendar year 1967 alone. It took me half an hour to write this paragraph as I scanned back and forth through the bands history in an effort to get the timeline correct. In the early days they were a typical rock and roll act who evolved into a late ‘60s psychedelic act before abandoning that format to become a more boogie rock band similar to T-Rex. This gave way to a rock style which led to the hard rock format that produced the cover of today’s feature song. To draw an analogy, Status Quo is kind of like the U.K.’s version of Spinal Tap without the parody and string of bizarre deaths involving their drummers. Here, it must be acknowledged that Status Quo, in their various incarnations had a string of hits and enjoyed tremendous adulation in their home country. For some reason it never translated to success in North America. Consider this; they have had 60 songs hit the charts, 22 of which reached the U.K. Top 10. They have sold over 118 million albums worldwide. When Bob Geldhof was looking for the ideal band to kick off the 1985 Live Aid Festival for Ethiopian Famine Relief he felt he needed to look no further than this accomplished act with a fascinating history.\n\nIt is estimated that 40% of the world’s population were watching Live Aid on July 13, 1985. When Status Quo took the stage they opened their set and the concert event itself with ‘Rockin All Over the World’. It was an appropriate choice for the band because it was one of their most recognizable songs, but even more the piece spoke to the significance of this event that aimed to unify the world in an effort to help those in Ethiopia dealing with a combination of famine and government corruption. The video at the outset of this feature shows an energized Status Quo powering their way through the song before an enthusiastic Wembley Stadium audience. It is one of many amazing moments from that memorable day. Interestingly, the Live Aid show was Alan Lancaster’s last show with Status Quo. He left the band due to concerns about inner turmoil, related to rampant drug and alcohol use and creative direction. He did rejoin for a series of dates in 2013. The final date of that tour on St. Patrick’s Day was at Wembley Arena and it was the source of a DVD released in September of that year. One of many highlights of Status Quo’s fascinating journey was being honoured with the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1991. To put some perspective on this recognition. The previous year this award was bestowed upon Queen in what was widely acknowledged to be Freddie Mercury’s last public appearance.\n\nSo, turning this post upside down, because on some occasions I do lead with the cover version and then go to the original, please note that ‘Rockin’ All Over the World’ all began with the very influential John Fogerty back in 1975. Here is his version.\n\nThis is a little harder than CCR and the typical John Fogerty style. He really rocks out on this track, but it may have been a little too raw for his devoted fans. I love it though. Gotta love the graphic from the Youtube post that shows the album cover I mentioned above. Good ol’ Shep is right there. A little ode to man’s best friend.\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this post that takes us back to two acts that are still performing in some capacity. Over 57 years of ‘Rockin’ All Over the World’ and counting."
