        "text": "I know this post is a bit late, but hey, better late than never. Anyway, what I came on here to talk about is the above album- Hello by Status Quo. Released on the 28th September 1973, it recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, and as far as I’m aware , it received very little coverage apart from a cover piece in Classic Rock magazine. In my humble opinion it is Status Quo’s greatest album, and one that had a massive impact on me the first time I heard it. You could say it changed my life.\n\nI was 12 years old in 1973 and already obsessed with music. I already owned three Beatles albums, Sgt Pepper and the recently released Blue and Red compilations, and I’d been buying singles for over a year, and was well into Glam Rock, Slade, 10cc etc. I was mainly into singles, while my brother four years older was into albums, especially the heavier variety, Led Zep, Sabbath, Floyd etc , which didn’t interest me at all at that age( they would years later).\n\nOne evening towards the end of the year, he asked me to listen to a song from a new album he’d bought. I said ok, but I don’t like you’re stuff. He said try it, and I did. The song was Caroline and I was blown away. I played the whole album, couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and apart from my Beatles albums, it is probably the most played album in my life. It is joyous, 39 minutes of pure pop, rock and roll, glorious riffs and great musicianship from Francis, Rick and Alan, all just 24 years old, whist John was a bit older at 27.\n\nLet’s look at why I think this is such a classic album.\n\nSide One\n\nTrack 1: Roll Over Lay Down- What an opener, a stone cold classic it hits you like a runaway train. The build up to the ending is superb and so powerful.\n\nTrack 2: Claudie- A wonderful song, that could almost be a country song. The song I used to play along to with my cheap plastic guitar in front of my bedroom mirror.\n\nTrack 3: A Reason For Living- The first Rick vocal, it always felt religious to me talking about owning up to my Maker and saying prayers. A great song though.\n\nTrack4: Blue Eyed Lady- What a classic riff to open a song with. A powerful song, the first of two Lancaster/Parfitt numbers.\n\nSide Two\n\nTrack 1: Caroline- Listen to it as if for the first time. Nothing more to say!\n\nTrack 2: Softer Ride-” I ain’t gonna work, I ain’t gonna work no more.” What a lovely sentiment, and another great record. Don’t be fooled by the quiet opening.\n\nTrack 3: And It’s Better Now- “Got to have something to sing about, everyone must have a song”. I love this song. The guitar and bass middle bit is just wonderful.\n\nTrack 4: Forty Five Hundred Times- Quo’s Magnum Opus? Most Quo fans think so, but I’m not sure. Their longest record at just under 10 minutes, it is certainly a classic. The first time I heard it live at Cardiff Castle in July 1976 will stay with me forever. There is a great version on the 1977 Live album at nearly 17 minutes long.\n\nSo there we have it . A classic album by a band that took over my life for the next 6-7 years. My interest was already waning by the late 70s, but when John Coghlan left in 1981that was it.\n\nI had no interest when the band reformed in 1986(did anyone), but I still continue to play those 70s albums to this day.\n\nSo do yourself a favour. Put Hello on, crank up the volume, and enjoy 39 minutes of pure joyous music. You won’t regret it.\n\nPs. Could someone post a couple of videos for me for Roll Over Lay Down, and Caroline.\n\nCheers Alan"
