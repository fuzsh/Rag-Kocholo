        "text": "The incredible inspiration behind Paul McCartney's song, which gave its name to the final Beatles album and film.\n\nFilmmaker Peter Jackson's Beatles documentary Get Back was the surprise hit of 2021.\n\nThe series was compiled from over 55 hours of unseen footage shot by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg in January 1969, which was originally intended for a TV special that would see The Beatles perform live, in front of an audience, for the first time in three years.\n\nThe live show idea was ultimately scrapped, so the documentary became about The Beatles making a new album... but the footage was sat on for a year, before being premiered in theatres in May 1970 as the feature film Let It Be. By that point The Beatles had split up. Now, the original theatrical cut of Let It Be is available for the first time in decades via Disney+.\n\nRead more: The Beatles' Let It Be film to be released on Disney+\n\nWritten and sung by McCartney, Let It Be was the last Beatles single to be unveiled before he announced his departure from the band.\n\nSpeaking to James Corden on the his segment of Carpool Karaoke in 2018, McCartney has recalled how his late mother - who died from cancer when he was 14 - inspired him to write the track.\n\nThe Liverpool legend explaned: \"I had a dream in the Sixties where my mum who died came to me in a dream and was reassuring me, saying: 'It's gonna be OK. Just let it be...'\"\n\nMcCartney's mother was also named Mary, which has been cited as an inspiration for the \"Mother Mary\" lyric.\n\nHowever, when in asked if it had any reference to the Virgin Mary, The Beatle has been known to leave it up to fans' interpretation.\n\nHowever, there is one other version of the story.\n\nMal Evans was one of The Beatles' right hand men. Together with Neil Aspinall (who ended up managing the band's Apple empire), Evans was the Fab Four's road crew, personal assistant and general go-to good guy and mate.\n\nIn 1975 TV special hosted by David Frost and called A Salute To The Beatles, Evans explained that it was him - and not Paul's mum - that was going to be the subject of the song,\n\nSpeaking to Frost, Evans said: \"Paul was meditating one day and I came to him in a vision, abd I was just standing there saying “let it be, let it be…” And that’s where the song came from… It's funny because we were coming home from a session one night, and it was 3 o’clock in the morning, raining, dark in London, and Paul was telling this, saying I've written this song.\n\n\"It was gonna be Brother Malcolm but I’ve had to change it in case people get the wrong idea!”\n\nWas Mal talking rubbish? A lot of people thought so and the \"Mother Mary Dream\" tale became the official version of the genesis of Let It Be. That was until an outtake appeared on the 2018 50th anniversary reissue of the classic \"White Album\", in which Paul tries out Let It Be while the band are midway through recording the song Piggies in September 1968. And there, in all its glory, are the lyrics: \"When I find myself in times of trouble, Brother Malcolm comes to me...\"\n\nSo who was right? Mal Evans died in January 1976 after a confrontation with armed police in Los Angeles. So, it would seem, Paul has the last word on this one..."
