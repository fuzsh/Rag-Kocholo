        "text": "Future has started his new record HNDRXX at the top of the Billboard 200, and in doing so, he has made history with what sounded like an impossible feat until he made it happen. The rapper has now debuted back-to-back albums at No. 1 on the all-genre tally, something that has not only never been done, but few (if any artists) could even say they attempted something so impressive.\n\nLast week, the hip-hop titan scored his fourth consecutive No. 1 record with his self-titled effort, which began at the top of the Billboard 200 with 140,000 equivalent units. Just a handful of days into FUTURE’s first tracking week, the rapper revealed that he had another full-length proper album coming on Friday, and true to his word, HHDRXX was released exactly one week after FUTURE.\n\nFrom the moment it was announced, HNDRXX was on track to rule, and now it has become so. The title begins in the driver’s seat with 121,000 copies, 48,000 of which are pure sales.\n\nFuture has now sent five albums to the top of the Billboard 200, and he has done so in a remarkably short period of time. He first reached the top of the tally with DS2 (which stands for Dirty Sprite 2) back in July of 2015. He followed that up in no time by again debuting in the highest position with What A Time To Be Alive, the mixtape he collaborated with Drake on. That title, which gave both artists their second No. 1 that year, ruled for a single frame in September of that year.\n\nNot one to rest for very long, Future then released his next album EVOL in February 2016, and it too started at the top. At the time, he made headlines, as all three albums had reached the pinnacle in a span of just seven months, which proved the hip-hop star to be a force that couldn't be ignored.\n\nFuture has now snatched five chart-topping titles in just under two years, which is an incredible showing of his unstoppable and unmatchable work ethic and his incredible popularity. Even the biggest names in the music business can have a difficult time beginning new full-lengths at the peak of the albums ranking, but Future doesn’t seem to know how to do anything else these days.\n\nIf you’re not impressed yet, consider this—these five collections only represent the majority of his musical output during that time period, not everything. He has also released three mixtapes in that time in between albums in order to keep his fans happy as he works on another full-length. While a mixtape and an album aren’t always interchangeable terms, both projects do require a great deal of work and time, and the fact that Future has dropped eight full releases in less than two years is unbelievable, but yet somehow true."
