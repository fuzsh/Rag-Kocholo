        "text": "Post by fretbuzzzzz on\n\nThe band went into the studio and put down their tracks for the song but went off on tour (Australia?) before it had been mixed etc Roger Glover had been asked to produce the single and decided to reconstruct a few things and mess with the tempo.\n\nAlan had put down a bass track/s in the studio but in the end Roger Glover decided to re-record the bass. It is Roger on the bass on the single. I suppose he could do it if anybody could, as bass player with Deep Purple etc.\n\nAs the band said...when they came back home, they came back to a different sounding track than the one they thought they had recorded.\n\nPost by swingseat on\n\nI think this an excellent song -its worth listening to the original and see how it was completely re-worked to retain the country feel but also allow for the typical Quo like sound to come through and change the accent of the song to something quite different, yet somehow still complimentary to its origins. Most fans strongly dislike Quo doing cover re-works, but they have been more skilled than many artists/bands at this in my opinion. As one who likes country music with both blues and rock influences within, it remains a good reason to like this song.\n\nPost by unspokenwords on\n\nI think that the band were thinking of a new direction and I remember an interview at the time where Rossi and Parfitt were sitting in one of their country piles, talked about this and also about the American market etc., They were wanting to soften and commercialise the sound more and Rossi had both the Eagles and Abba as the direction he wanted the band to go in (not realising he did not have the same song writing skills and talent or musical ability as these bands).\n\nFor this various producers were being considered including Roger Glover, Dave Edmunds etc., as part of this new direction and Wild Side of Life was part of the experimenting with the sound and producers.\n\nThey also recorded the Apollo live album as part of the leaving of the old sound behind.\n\nAs such Quo softened, just when punk was hitting the airwaves, and also decided that they would jettison the sound they had perfected over the classic series of albums up to Blue For You (although they did not fully seem to know that the softening was doing this)...and of course they opted for Pip Williams as part of the thought out strategy to become global and be like the Eagles, forgetting that they were actually Status Quo and had forged their own sound!\n\nDepends on opinion as to whether they succeeded in this, for Rossi still has a career of sorts and this may be sign that it worked, and who knows if things would have turned out better career wise if RAOTW had have followed in the footsteps of its predecessors. It did however create problems for they seriously struggled thereafter to get back to that classic run of albums quality when initial indications were that fans were not happy but also it did not make them The Eagles or Fleetwood Mac.\n\nWild Side of Life had in my opinion a pivotal role in this but only as the test bed for a softer Quo direction.\n\nPost by freewilly on\n\nIn my opinion, they(he?) barked up the wrong tree.\n\nThey went from making music they felt like making, to making music they thought was appealing to a mass audience. They weren't ABBA, The Eagles or Fleetwood Mac and a listen to any of their albums would indicate Quo(Rossi) were well out of their depth. It wasn't them.\n\nLOAI, A Year, Lonely Man, Rock n Roll, Who Am I, songs like that in my opinion, are absolutely brilliant. Sure they're different from the norm but, you felt something because it's what the band felt and wanted to portray to the listener. They mean't it. The Wild Ones, Alan may have got the credit for it but, it was Francis who fell in love with it and turned it and arranged it into what it became.\n\nBy comparison, songs like Address Book, Tommy, Looking Out For Caroline are so contrived and forced that it leaves one thinking they're in a fucking elevator. It's almost saying \"Look what we(I) can do!!!\"\n\nSad in my mind. Ego ruins a good thing.\n\nWSOL is a good track though"
