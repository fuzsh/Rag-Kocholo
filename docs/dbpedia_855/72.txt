The building was known for art galleries, many of whom left after disputes, and for extraordinarily high rent charged to Abercrombie and Fitch, which also vacated due to cost. It is estimated that the building is now over half vacant, with a number of remaining tenants known to be moving to less costly premises. The vacancies have started to make the building know in central as “ghost building”, “ghost art building” and “haunted building”.
