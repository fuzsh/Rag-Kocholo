It runs south–north from Queen's Road Central, continues through Des Voeux Road Central, and ends at its intersection with Connaught Road Central.\n\t\n\tThe street was named after Lieutenant William Pedder, first lieutenant of the Nemesis, Britain's first ocean-going iron warship, and the first harbour master of Hong Kong. Pedder Street was established at the centre of Hong Kong's commerce in the early colonial days.\n\t\n\tThe premises of Hong Kong's two most powerful trading hongs at the time, Dent & Co. and Jardine, Matheson & Co., were located on The Praya Central, Victoria's original waterfront, on the opposite sides of Pedder Street. Dent & Co., one of the key founding members of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, had a sprawling complex which stretched along the Praya, and a west wing which abutted Pedder Street.\n\t\n\tOriginally, Pedder Street ran from Pedder's Hill, where the Harbour Master's Office was established, south to north ending at Pedder's Wharf on the Praya. The street was extended north by 1904 when the Praya Reclamation Scheme finished transforming the old Praya into the modern day Des Voeux Road, along with a further stretch of land running north up to Connaught Road on which the General Post Office and Union Building were built.\n\t\n\tThe new pier built at the end of Pedder Street following the reclamation was named \"Blake Pier\" after the city's 13th Governor.",
