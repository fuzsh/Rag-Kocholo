        "text": "DED Period: Feb. 6, 2023 – Feb. 5, 2025 EADs Auto-Extended Through: Feb. 5, 2025 Federal Register Notice Citation: 88 FR 28589\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2021, President Biden issued a memorandum to defer for 18 months the removal of certain residents of Hong Kong who were present in the United States as of Aug. 5, 2021,\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2023, President Biden issued a memorandum to defer for 24 months the removal of certain residents of Hong Kong who were present in the United States as of Jan. 26, 2023, as well as those who were covered under the initial period of DED, except for those:\n\nWho have voluntarily returned to Hong Kong or the People’s Republic of China (PRC) after Jan. 26, 2023;\n\nWho have not continuously resided in the United States since Jan. 26, 2023;\n\nWho are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));\n\nWho have been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet the criteria in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));\n\nWho are subject to extradition;\n\nWhose presence in the United States the secretary of homeland security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or\n\nWhose presence in the United States the secretary of state has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\n\nEmployment Authorization\n\nYou are eligible for employment authorization under the DED period if you:\n\nAre a Hong Kong resident as described in the Federal Register notice cited above;\n\nWere present in the United States as of Jan. 26, 2023;\n\nHave continuously resided in the United States since Jan. 26, 2023; and\n\nAre otherwise eligible for DED.\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Hong Kong residents are defined as individuals who have met the requirements for, and been issued, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) passport, a British National Overseas passport, a British Overseas Citizen passport, a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card, or an HKSAR Document of Identity for Visa Purposes.\n\nExamples of documents that you can submit to establish nationality/identity include copies of any of the following:\n\nHKSAR passport;\n\nBritish National Overseas passport;\n\nBritish Overseas Citizen passport;\n\nHong Kong Permanent Identity Card; or\n\nHKSAR Document of Identity for Visa Purposes.\n\nExamples of documents that you can submit to establish presence/continuous residence include copies of any of the following:\n\nPassport;\n\nForm I-94, Arrival-Departure Record;\n\nEmployment records;\n\nRent receipts, utility bills (gas, electric, telephone, etc.) or receipts, or letters from companies showing dates when the applicant received service;\n\nPassport entries;\n\nBank books with dated transactions;\n\nSelective Service card;\n\nAttestations by churches, unions, or other organizations of the applicant’s residence;\n\nAffidavits;\n\nMoney order receipts for money sent into or out of the United States;\n\nBirth certificates of children born in the United States;\n\nCorrespondence between the applicant and others; or\n\nSocial Security card.\n\nHow to File for an Employment Authorization Document\n\nIf you are covered under DED for Hong Kong and you want a DED-based Employment Authorization Document (EAD) valid through Feb. 5, 2025, follow the instructions provided in the Federal Register notice on how to apply for an EAD.\n\nYou must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and pay the associated fee (or request a fee waiver). On Form I-765, indicate that you are covered under DED for Hong Kong by putting “(a)(11)” in response to Question 27. You may request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request.\n\nIf we need biometrics to produce a secure EAD, we will notify you of your appointment to appear at a USCIS Application Support Center.\n\nYou may check general processing times for Form I-765 on our processing times page.\n\nHow to Request Authorization to Travel Outside the United States\n\nDHS may provide travel authorization as a discretionary benefit of DED for eligible Hong Kong residents. You must file for advance parole if you wish to travel outside of the United States temporarily. Advance parole authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to allow you to return to the United States during a specified period. A CBP inspector will make the final decision on your reentry. If you leave the United States without first receiving advance parole, you may no longer be eligible for DED and may not be permitted to reenter the United States.\n\nTo request advance parole, you must file Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, and pay the associated fee. The filing instructions on Form I-131 list all the documents you will need to provide to USCIS. You may also find information about acceptable documentation and DED eligibility on USCIS’ Deferred Enforced Departure webpage.\n\nYou may file Form I-765 and Form I-131 together or separately."
