        "text": "Central is the main business and financial hub of Hong Kong. With the most prestigious addresses, it is also where most of the largest names in the art gallery world can be found. Located within commercial buildings, the galleries are easily located and easily accessible – it’s hard to get lost. Pedder Building and H Queen’s are the two main ‘art buildings’, and other galleries are all within close proximity. Two international auction houses also call Central home, hosting pre-auction viewings at the galleries inside their offices.\n\nGalerie du Monde\n\nStart by paying a visit to local powerhouse Galerie du Monde on Duddell Street. The gallery was established in 1974 and operates under the directorship of Fred Scholle and Kelvin Yang, showcasing modern and contemporary works by internationally-established Chinese artists in its expansive space, such as Wang Gongyi, Wu Chi-Tsung, and Fung Ming Chip. The gallery also offers a highly-regarded bespoke framing service for clients.\n\nWhile you’re on the same street, why not check out the latest exhibition going on at Duddell’s. The destination is Hong Kong’s popular one-star Michelin dining and social club with a vibrant art programme, with curated exhibitions and art lectures throughout the year.\n\nFun fact: take note of the granite steps by the Duddell Street cul-de-sac, constructed between 1875 and 1889. According to records of the Hong Kong and China Gas Company, the four gas lamps flanking the steps are the sole surviving working gas street lamps in Hong Kong since 1967.\n\nHauser & Wirth\n\nVisit Hauser & Wirth at its new location in the heart of Central. Named after its founders and established in Zurich in 1992, the world-renowned gallery has built a reputation for its dedication to artists and the support of visionary projects worldwide, from major 20th century modern masters to leading figures in contemporary art. A commitment to education underpins all Hauser & Wirth exhibitions, with lectures, interactive seminars, innovative workshops, and special events developed for a range of target audiences.\n\nOpera Gallery\n\nA few doors down, Opera Gallery is an international art space founded by Gilles Dyan in 1994, showcasing modern and contemporary art globally. With locations in over 10 countries, Opera Gallery is a constant presence at international art fairs, focussing mainly on the secondary market. In Hong Kong, its new location on 9 Queen’s Road Central since 2021 has given it more presence and visibility.\n\nAuction powerhouse Christie’s, which also has an art gallery, is in Alexandra House across Chater Road. Besides Chinese ceramics, paintings, jewellery and contemporary art, Christie’s also holds regular auctions for luxury handbags! In additional to regular in-house exhibitions, Christie’s holds its impressive large-scale pre-auction preview at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre twice a year.\n\nPEDDER BUILDING\n\nIf you’re still hungry for more art, why not pay a visit to the international galleries in Pedder Building on the other side of The Landmark on Pedder Street. A Grade II historical building in the Beaux-Arts style, it’s hard to miss.\n\nDesigned by Palmer and Turner Architects in 1923, it is the last surviving pre-WW2 building on Pedder Street – one of the grande dames of Central.\n\nGagosian\n\nGagosian is situated on the 7th floor of Pedder Building and needs no introduction. The eponymous gallery was founded in LA in 1980, and represents some of the world’s most influential artists and estates of the 20th and 21st centuries – Jeff Koons, Jenny Saville, Anselm Kiefer, Taryn Simon, and Zeng Fanzhi, to name a few. Their exhibitions are always well-curated and highly-anticipated, with the security details to match.\n\nPearl Lam Galleries\n\nPearl Lam Galleries, named after its Hong Kong founder, is on the 6th floor of the same building. Founded in 2005, it plays a vital role in stimulating dialogue and cross-cultural exchange between East and West. With a sister gallery in Shanghai, it is one of the most influential local galleries in Hong Kong. To date, our favourite exhibitions have been those by Chun Kwang Young, Zanele Muholi, Yinka Shonibare CBE, and Su Xiaobai.\n\nH QUEEN’S\n\nNext, head to H Queen’s on Queen’s Road Central next to the iconic steps of Pottinger Street. Designed by Hong Kong architect and art collector William Lim’s firm CL3, the building was completed in 2017. Home to several high-end restaurants and luxury brands, it is also known for being an ‘art building’, housing many international galleries. Hart Hall on the ground level is a pop-up space showcasing a diverse programme of art, innovative retail and design – worth checking out if you have the time.\n\nPace\n\nStart on the 12th floor to visit Pace, a leading gallery which operates several spaces around the world. Founded in 1960 in Boston, the gallery is a vital player in the art world in presenting rich programmes that shape the history, creation and engagement with modern and contemporary art. Notable artists represented include Yoshitomo Nara, Mary Corse, Zhang Xiaogang, and Loie Hollowell.\n\nTang Contemporary Art\n\nNext, pay a visit to Tang Contemporary Art on the 10th floor. Founded in Bangkok in 1997, the gallery is committed to producing exhibitions and projects, especially producing critical projects and exhibitions. The gallery promotes experimental contemporary art regionally as well as worldwide, and has shown the likes of Ai Wei Wei, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Nam June Paik, and Zhu Jinshi in Hong Kong.\n\nWhitestone Gallery\n\nThe interior of Whitestone Gallery on the 8th floor was designed by world-renowned architect, Kengo Kuma. Founded in Tokyo in 1967, the gallery’s zen aesthetics provide a serene viewing experience in the promotion of Japanese and Asian talent worldwide. The gallery is also known for being a platform to showcase Gutai and post-war art, as well as emerging contemporary art of the region. Memorable exhibitions in Hong Kong include presentations by Yoshitomo Nara, Dale Chihuly, Florentijn Hofman, and Philip Colbert.\n\nDavid Zwirner\n\nLastly, visit David Zwirner on the 5th and 6th floors – the New York gallery founded by the German-born gallerist in 1993. Influential for representing the biggest names in the industry, and for promoting contemporary art globally for the past 30 years, the gallery reported in 2018 an annual revenue of USD500 million. Taking the gallery’s world renowned artists, estates, and exhibition programmes as the starting point, David Zwirner Books is the publishing arm of the gallery, and is dedicated to publishing the highest quality art publications from monographs, artist books, collected writings and interviews. A visit here would complete your tour of the H Queen’s galleries.\n\nWhite Cube"
