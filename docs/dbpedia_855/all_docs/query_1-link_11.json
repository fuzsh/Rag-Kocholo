        "text": "When I landed in Hong Kong 21 years ago, I assumed I’d find streets like this one.\n\nSadly, that wasn’t the case.\n\nMy mom took this photo in 1962 in Hong Kong’s Central district. Now Pedder Street looks more like New York than a outpost of the British Empire. Gloucester Building and its clock tower are long gone, as are the traffic police and those funky pagodas.\n\nIt seems like for every decade of Hong Kong’s rapid development, dozens of colonial buildings have met with the demolition ball.\n\nAnd now only a dozen or so of these colonial gems remain. The Peninsula Hotel is one, as is the Legislative Council Building. There’s also the former French Mission Building and the Foreign Correspondents’ Club.\n\nThe Hong Kong Tourism Board lists others here.\n\nSure, Hong Kong has witnessed much progress since the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but at what cost?"
