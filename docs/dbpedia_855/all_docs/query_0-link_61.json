        "text": "Condé Nast Traveler Global Affairs Editor DORINDA ELLIOTT shares her favorite Hong Kong shops\n\nSHANGHAI TANG I know, it’s become a cliché, but Shanghai Tang is still a super-cool store where you can always find some chic, kitschy twist on 1930s-style Chinese clothing or objects. The Art Deco building housing the store in Central is gorgeous, one of Hong Kong’s great sights (Pedder Building, 12 Pedder St.; 852-2525-7333)\n\nG.O.D. Every time I land in Hong Kong, I head to G.O.D, or Goods of Desire, a favorite with Hong Kong’s young and hip. It takes its inspiration from old Hong Kong/Cantonese culture, with 1950s British influences—the store sells Cultural Revolution–inspired T-shirts, fun bags printed with Hong Kong images, and other quirky objects (like coasters printed with the images of buttered toast sold at old tea shops). It’s a great place for gifts (flagship store, Central, G/F & 1/F, 48 Hollywood Rd.; 852-2805-1876)\n\nYUE HWA CHINESE PRODUCTS This used to be the place to load up on Communist-era steals, from intricately painted kites to chic, underpriced padded Chinese jackets. The Chinese Products emporiums around town have changed over the years, as China’s exports have become more sophisticated, but you can still find lots of fun stuff here, from acupuncture needles and penis-enhancing pills to Chinese drums and (somewhat fancier than before) padded jackets (301-309 Nathan Rd., Kowloon; 852-3511-2222)\n\nHANART TZ GALLERY I am always on the lookout for interesting avant-garde art from mainland China, and I know that I will always find something exciting at Hanart, a gallery in the center of Central district. Johnson Chang, who practically singlehandedly brought China’s art scene to Hong Kong almost two decades ago, is one of the city’s—and the world’s—leading experts on the topic (407 Pedder Building, 12 Pedder Street, Central, Hong Kong; 852-2526 9019)\n\n** HOLLYWOOD ROAD** You haven’t been to Hong Kong if you haven’t wandered along Hollywood Road, which is home to the city’s top antique and junk shops. I usually start at the top to the west, at Wing Tee, a dusty old shop that sells tomb relics and pottery, just next to a traditional coffin shop. A little ways down the hill and across the street to the east, Dragon Culture (G/F, 231 Hollywood Rd.; 852-2545-8098) sells some high-quality tomb figures. Don’t stop there: Keep walking to check out the Man Mo Temple and its clouds of incense smoke, and the smarter furniture shops approaching Central.\n\n_\n\nImage Courtesy of G.O.D._"
