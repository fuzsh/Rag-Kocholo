        "text": "A definitive Account\n\nfrom over twenty five first hand accounts incluing Chan Chaks journal\n\nPreface\n\nBritain had adopted double summer time so even in winter Britain was GMT +1 hour. Hong Kong War-time was GMT+7.5 hours. Seven and a half hours after the attack on Pearl Harbour the Imperial Japanese Army attacked Hong Kong. Within days Churchill, with a party numbering eighty, including all his Chiefs of Staff, was racing across the North Atlantic onboard the battleship HMS Duke of York to North America. Most of the staffers were constantly seasick as the battleship steamed at full speed pitching and rolling through the turbulent winter waters. Churchill was not and he kept his staff busy keeping in contact with all the battle fronts using his portable war room. What followed was a most remarkable chain of events culminating in East meeting West. I have no doubts in believing that this story started with the summit, code-named Arcadia, between Churchill and Roosevelt in the White House which started three days before Hong Kong capitulated. The Arcadia agreements remained secret, the main thing was Churchill had persuaded FDR to concentrate on Europe first. Appeasing Chiang Kai‐shek in his battle with the Japanese was crucial.\n\nThe story of this epic escape has been written about many times, but the reason for the escape has remained a mystery. Just what did invoke this epic escape, those involved were sworn to secrecy. Never in the annuls of the Royal Navy have they willingly handed over a ship to a foreign native, now the order came through to hand an entire flotilla over to a Chinese Admiral. Why was it so important to risk the lives of British crews on the far side of the world and on whose orders. Following years of research I think I have found the answer and it will surprise all who read it about it.\n\nThis story of daring-do was told to me and my siblings many times by our father, Petty Officer Bud Hide late of MTB 07. We lived in Gosport, across the water from Portsmouth, close to the MTB base HMS Hornet, where dad used to take us on regular trips, often meeting his former Hong Kong escapee colleagues. Many years later, long after father's untimely death, I was invited out to Hong Kong by Admiral Chan Chak's twin sons, Donald and Duncan. They knew every detail of their father's escape from the island and duly showed me all the points of interest, from his private office on the 4th floor of the Pedder Building and the site of his official office on the corner of Queens Road and Pedder Street to the crevasse where he sheltered alone on a deserted island at the end of Aberdeen Channel. That same year I was also given the Fair Log of MTB 07, my father's boat, covering the second half of 1941 including the battle for Hong Kong and subsequent escape. The Chan twins gave me access to their father's journal covering the same period.\n\nI have now acquired more than 25 first-hand accounts of the escape, the most comprehensive collection of this most daring of wartime escape.\n\nSub-Lieutenant Lewis Bush HKRNVR Lt-Com Gandy RN (Rtrd) Commanding Officer of the 2nd MTB Flotilla, ordered preparation of the remaining boats for a long voyage and provisions were to be made for scuttling them if necessary and for long marches across country and mountain climbing. [91]\n\nThe 2nd MTB Flotilla evaded capture, and escaped from Hong Kong, engaging in secret negotiations with Chinese guerrillas before scuttling their boats deep behind enemy lines. The crew of the 2nd MTB Flotilla were to be the armed guard of the legendry one legged Chinese Admiral Chan Chak as they marched overland through the Japanese occupied mountains to Free China. Later the Navy party were aided by allied special forces as they crossed into Burma.\n\nThey were feted at every city they passed through and at one stage were entertained for three days by Dr Robert Kho Seng Lim, Surgeon-General of the Republic of China.\n\nIn Rangoon they fought insurgents and fifth columnists alongside the elite volunteer Force Viper Marines before escaping on the last merchantman out.\n\nSworn to secrecy most took their secrets to the grave, leaving their diaries and accounts to whom it may concern. It is an epic tale of East meets West with consequences that reverberate around the world and across time.\n\nIt is their story in their words. Hong Kong could not be held but had to be defended.\n\nResearch compiled by Buddy Hide Jr\n\nThe Chinese had been at war with Japan since 1937 and following the invasion of Hong Kong on 8th December 1941 the IJA pushed the British back to Hong Kong Island where they established a bridgehead in just ten days. HMS Duke of York was nearing Norfolk, Virginia and Churchill was making plans for his meeting with FDR. The Hong Kong situation was a huge embarrassment and it was obvious that they could not hold out for long. Churchill was seeking to gain something positive from the situation. In Hong Kong orders were received stating that the Chinese delegation led by Admiral Chan Chak, must be returned to Free China at all costs in the event of a surrender. The mission was delegated to the Senior Service with their flotilla of high speed low profile motor torpedo boats. On Christmas Day as the Colony succumbed to the overwhelming force of the Imperial Japanese Army the planned escape was put into action. Of the seventy two men who set out and attempted to escape, sixty eight landed on the beach at Nanao behind enemy lines the following morning.\n\nI grew up with this incredible story, for my father was one of those men. In 1959 I joined my elder brother, David, at the Royal Hospital School where I met other sons of the Christmas Day Hong Kong escape party.\n\nTo me and my siblings the green and white Gosport ferry was the 'Star Ferry' and Portsmouth was 'Hong Kong Island'. The MTB base, HMS Hornet, in Gosport just added spice to our fertile minds.\n\nOne of those was Pony Moore who was later asked by HRH Prince Philip to regale the escape several times in after dinner stories at the estate in Anglesey where HMS Conway, a naval college was based. HRH came for an annual shoot on the estate. With my father keeping his copy of the iconic Waichow photo hanging in the family home I was never going to forget this amazing event.\n\nTo me and my siblings growing up in Gosport before we emigrated the green and white Gosport to Portsmouth ferry was the 'Star Ferry' and Portsmouth was 'Hong Kong Island'. The MTB base, HMS Hornet, in Gosport just added spice to our fertile minds.\n\nAfter my father's untimely death, and the first stirrings of a public internet system I decided to see if I could utilize it to bring the iconic Waichow photo to life and trace my father's former colleagues in Hong Kong, or their descendants. I published a one page web site back in 1997/8, and, to my amazement I got some response. An early contact was from the son of Admiral Chan Chak. This was the start of a lifelong friendship with the Admiral's twin sons Donald and Duncan.\n\nThe Chan family gave me exclusive access to their fathers journals, meticulously written up by Admiral Chan Chak. In 1999 we spent an entire afternoon and evening discussing the escape and our plans to retrace the early stages of the escape. Chan Chak had a copy of the iconic 'Waichow Photo' with all the names and under the gaze of a large portrait of Chan Chak we vowed to bring the photo to life and retrace the route to Waichow now Huizhou. This we achieved ten years later in 2009 along with over eighty other descendants. We had also arranged an exhibition entitled 'Escape from Hong Kong the road to Waichow' which was on display at the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence attracting just under 500,000 paying visitors over three years.\n\nSome of my other very early contacts included Alex Kennedy’s widow Joy, David MacDougall’s family, Ted Ross’s son Warwick, and Lawrence Kilbee, late O/C MTB 08 who lived local to me here in Sussex. Although Lawrence was put ashore by Gandy just as the Chan Chak party turned up, he was a mine of information on the build-up to the MTB departure.\n\nAnother very early contact was Tony Banham of Hongkongwardiary dot com. Even though Tony held a degree in computing he had not thought of utilizing the world wide net for his research. It was not long before he followed my example, reaping the benefits of people coming to him rather than him chasing them. I was able to supply the MTB information for his first publication “Not the Slightest Chance”.\n\nOver the years I have tracked down and obtained every known first-hand account of this most ordacious of escapes. In 2003 a Professor at the University of Minnesota faxed me a first-hand account held in the archives of the escape party arriving in Guiyang after one of their Lorries had overturned. Yet more came from church archives in New Zealand. I passed on some of those accounts to others who went on to publish their interpretation of the events.\n\nWith the many first-hand accounts I have obtained I believe this is the closest that can be achieved after such a long gap from the time of those most extraordinary events on Christmas Day 1941 in Hong Kong.\n\nThis is the written words of those who escaped.\n\nWhen in Hong Kong, I, of course prefer to cross over to Kowloon on the \"Star ferry,\" rather than the newer road tunnels, or the MTR. There is something about it that reminds me of my innocent youth in Gosport dreaming of Hong Kong.\n\nLieutenant-Commander Gerard H Gandy RN (Ret) pulled off this most audacious escape right under the noses of the Japanese. Prevailing against all the odds, he marched his ships company three thousand miles overland through the mountains of southern China and Burma to freedom without serious loss or injury.\n\nSeveral books have been published extolling the virtues of the staff officers from Battle HQ, who volunteered to look after the Admiral, and escort him to the rendezvous with the Motor Torpedo Boats. But were they team players and heroes, or were they just a bunch of self-opinionated \"Hooray Henry's\" whose only concern was saving themselves!\n\nRead the most comprehensive account ever written at www.hongkongescape.org and judge for yourself.\n\nThis is the words of those who escaped, you decide.\n\nLieutenant-Commander Gerard H Gandy was undoubtedly the hero in pulling off this most audacious escape right under the noses of the Japanese. Prevailing against all the odds, Gandy escaped and marched his ships company three thousand miles overland through the mountainous terrain of southern China to freedom without serious loss or injury.\n\nNobody has lived with, and researched this episode in the battle for Hong Kong for as long, or as passionately as I have.\n\nPlanning the Admiral's Escape\n\nF W Kendall SOE Returned to Hong Kong after his mining consultancy in southern China was interrupted by the Japanese occupation. Mike, as he was known was recruited by Jim Gaven when he visited the Colony. In July 1941 Mike, along with Eddie Teesdale went on an STS101 course in Singapore. On their return to Hong Kong they recruited ten operatives to join the newly formed Reconnaissance Unit. In August 1941 Christopher Hudson was appointed as the first head of the SOE Far East branch in London. [67]\n\nMaj-Gen S. Woodburn Kirby (Author) \"The Far Eastern situation was examined in 1921 by the Committee of Imperial Defence which came to the conclusion that there was no possibility of making Hong Kong sufficiently secure against attack. Thus it could no longer be considered an adequate base for British naval forces in the Far East.\" [96]\n\nThe Admiralty telegram declaring war arrived at 05.12 local time on the 8th December 1941. Just under three hours later the first air raid from Canton was bombing Kai Tak airport destroying the old RAF fleet along with the Pan Am Clipper preparing for take-off from Kowloon Bay.\n\nAll shipping had been cleared by 02.00 with 39 scuttled, 13 seized, 1 sunk by air attack, and 3 captured at sea, with 6 unknown.\n\nAn estimated 15,000 Sampans and Junks had collected in Yaumati Typhoon Anchorage between Stonecutters Island and the Mainland. With River Steamers scuttled across the entrance and the outer approaches mined.\n\nAll but one of the SOE were behind enemy lines when the Japanese invaded. He, Mike Kendall, reported to Colonel L A Newnham, GOC1 at Battle HK. Newnham was later executed while POW. [11]\n\nAfter just twelve days of hostilities the Japanese were swarming over Hong Kong Island. Following Germany and Japan both declaring war on the United Staes Churchill telegramed Roosevelt with an offer to meet him in Washington. Churchill, with all his Chiefs of Staff, was greeted by President Roosevelt at Washington airport on 22nd December and stayed with the President as a guest at the White House where they worked very closely together and dined together every night for almost three weeks discussing the war against Germany and Japan.\n\nF W Kendall SOE \"About a week before Hong Kong fell I was asked to prepare an escape route. We had five MTB’s there, all fully equipped and what not and the night of the surrender we took off these, I was the leader of that group which had got these MTB’s with about seventy odd people on board. Key personnel from Government and key military personnel, people who could tell the story of Hong Kong outside.\" [67]\n\nStaffies in the Battle-Box HQ soon got wind of the navy's intended mission, prompting a few to start scheming how to tag along.\n\nMaj Goring BHQ \"One night I found myself alone with the General [Maltby]. I told him that, In the event of surrender, I intended to attempt an escape. How do you propose to do it?\" he asked. Take a sampan and sail away I suppose. I replied.\n\nThe General informed me that there was a plan afoot for a small Naval party to smuggle out a very important Chinese naval officer, a certain Admiral Chan Chak, provided there was a suitable boat left un-sunk. If I cared to see the organizer [Mike Kendall] there might be room for me; and, since I knew Admiral Chan Chak personally, I might be given the task of escorting him to the rendezvous when the moment came.\" [17]\n\nThe General and his commanding officers told the staffies who requested to flee the Colony that they could go when the end came, not before. They would have to make their own arrangements if they wished to join the official escape party.\n\nThose who knew Mike Kendall cotacted him to make arrangements to join the escape party, others apparently just tagged along.\n\nGeorge Wright-Nooth (Author) \"It was about this time that I had an offer to join an escape bid to get out of Hong Kong at the eleventh hour, which we could all see was fast approaching. It was Robinson, the fellow policeman whom I had got to know quite well, who offered me a passage on one of the boats.\" [42]\n\nGeorge Wright-Nooth failed to join the escape party in the end.\n\nSq-Ldr Max Oxford RAF \"One of the queer organizations we had for operating behind the enemy lines was led by a Canadian adventurer [Kendall] I had known for some time and he asked me if I would care to join him in a break for freedom when the end came.\" [85]\n\nCapt Freddie Guest BHQ \"Captain Peter Macmillan, a staff officer like myself, and I decided to to take our chance and contact the Chinese Admiral, Chan Chak, with the object of trying to make an escape.\n\nAfter some difficulty we managed to find him with his ADC Henry Hsu and told them that although we had no set plans we were prepared to try to escape with them to the Chinese mainland.\" [29]\n\nTed Ross MoI \"We contacted some daring Chinese junkmen and made tentative plans to have them smuggle us out at a thousand dollars a head. This plan failed because we couldn't leave until after the surrender. The junks couldn't hang around waiting indefinitely as the Jap's were capturing one place after another along the coastline, and we could give them no indication when or where we'd be when the white flag went up.\" [28]\n\nPhilip Snow (Author) \"In Hong Kong itself a close link was developed with Chan Chak, a Nationalist Admiral raised in the Colony who hobbles onto the stage like a Chinese Long John Silver with a wooden leg and prominent, pugnacious jaw.\n\nShortly after Canton fell in 1938 this picturesque figure had been sent to Hong Kong by Chiang-Kai-Shek to take charge of the Nationalist underground there.\" [71]\n\nOliver Lindsay (Author) \"The Admiral was a flamboyant and ruthless character. He had lost a leg in a naval action against the Japanese on the Yangtze River. The mission’s second-in-command, Major-General S K Yee, represented the Chinese Secret Service. During the fighting for Hong Kong both these officers assisted the British with counter-espionage measures and in the liquidation of Chinese fifth-columnists.\" [80]\n\nAdm Chan Chak ROROC Had earned a fearsome reputation defending Sun Yat Sen, the Father of the Nation and was known locally as the Nelson of the East. In the early 20th century Chan Chak had been incarcerated in Ap Chau Prison in Macau by the Portuguese. Sun Yat-sen's first wife lived at No1 Bastilles Street and brought meals and canned fruit to him on a regular basis. Sun Yet-san sent a representative, Sun Ke, with a 5000 Yuan guarantee to have Chan released but it was turned down. Sun Yet-san's negotiator spent six months negotiating his release before Chan and his twenty two colleagues were designated political prisoners and finally released. [6]\n\nHe had enjoyed a guided tour of his hero's flag-ship, HMS Victory during an official visit to England in August 1933. From then on he made it his business to be close to the British in Hong Kong. [6] [90]\n\nChan Chack had been the Chairman of the Kuomintang in Hong Kong and Macau since June 1941 with offices on the 2nd floor in the Asiatic Building in Queens Road under two cover companies, Wah Kee Hong and Wing Kee Hong trade companies. In reality they were the cover for the General Party Branch of the Kuomintang. They represented both the Party and the ROC government. Through this office Chan Chak kept close liasons with theBritish political and military authorities. Much of his dealings were with David MacDogall, head of the Ministry of Information.\n\nColin McEwan S.O.E. \"They were the Nationalist government's representatives in HK trying to establish contact with the guerrillas in the HK border area, whom we would supply with arms in turn for their interfering in the Japanese lines of communication.\" [11]\n\nThirty seven old David MacDougall was on his second posting to Hong Kong with the Colonial Service, having first arrived in 1928 as a cadet after graduating with an M. A, from St Andrews University in Scotland. When hostilities erupted in Europe he returned to Hong Kong as Secretary to the Far Eastern Bureau of the Ministry of Information (MoI). Mac was answerable to John Galvin, Deputy Head of the Far Eastern Bureau of the Ministry of Information, based in Chungking. [26]\n\nMac had offices on the 1st floor of the Hong Kong Bank building. Along with many others he was forced to evacuate to the Gloucester Hotel in Des Voeux Road on the corner with Pedder Street.\n\nChan Chak had been wounded while defending Canton from the Japanese and came to Hong Kong in the Spring of 1938 for medical treatment. Chan was treated in the French Hospital, St Pauls, where his left leg was amputated below the knee.. He soon recovered and worked on his fitness. Chan Chack was appointed Chairman of the Kuomintang in Hong Kong and Macau since June 1941.\n\nTwo stock-broker trading companies, Wah Kee Hong & Wing Kee Hong, with offices registered in Shell House, formerly the APC building at 24-32 Queen's Road Central, were set up as covers for the Chinese political parties. The General Party Branch of the Kuomintang representing and the ROC central government. Chan Chak was appointed overall commander of both. Much of Chan's dealings were with David MacDogall, head of the Ministry of Information. His mission consisted of 37 year old Colonel S. K. Yee, known as S.K, posing as an insurance salesman from Shanghai who spoke perfect English without an accent. Twenty nine year old Flag Lt-Commander Heng Hsu ROC, ADC to Chan and known as Henry, along with 45 year old Coxswain Yeung Chuen his bodyguard and martial arts expert.\n\nThe wily Admiral controlled a network of informers, spies, as well as pirate-come-smugglers from the Dapeng Peninsula on the far side of Mirs Bay. They operated in and around Hong Kong waters and the Pearl Delta. Western commodities especially petrol were highly sought after in what was predominantly a chaotic and lawless part of China.\n\nWhen the Japanese invaded Chan secured a residence on the 4th floor of the Pedder Building, close to the Gloucester Hotel. Under British Colonial law, no natives of the empire could overnight in a European hotel.\n\nA keen sportsman Chan was not deterred by his disability. He enjoyed prolonged swimming sessions in the numerous bays around Hong Kong, as well as regular knockabouts on the tennis court with David MacDougall amongst others. [6]\n\nKendall the leader of \"S.O.E.\" only had two of his team in Hong Kong when the Japanese invaded, Colin McEwan as his 'runner' and John Talan his undercover man in HK. The remainder were trapped behind enemy lines. [11] Their tasks were many and varied.\n\nColin McEwan SOE \"Frances Woodley Kendall, Mike, as he was generally known, came from Vancouver although he had lived in Hong Kong for several years. He was originally a mining engineer with a knowledge of explosives. His wife was Chinese and he was also a Cantonese speaker with some knowledge of other dialects.\n\nKendall, who was not a member of the Volunteers, was in Hong Kong officially to advise on refugee camps and that was said to have been his 'cover'. As officer commanding S.O.E., Kendall reported directly to Colonel Newnham (Chief of Staff and GOC1) at military headquarters.\" [11]\n\nKendall and his team engaged in the art of \"ungentlemanly warfare\" and were known as the 'Recce Unit'.\n\nWith the planes now destroyed the Governor and C-in-C of Hong Kong, Sir Marc Young was going through the options to facilitate extracting the Chinese Military Council headed by Admiral Chan Chak out of Hong Kong and safely back to Free China in order for Britain to save face with the Nationalist Chinese Government.\n\nWhen Christmas Day dawned none had any idea of the events that lay ahead. These events would be etched in their minds for the rest of their natural lives. With all Royal Navy ships scuttled except for the 2nd MTB Flotilla and its support vessels, the Royal Navy was now fighting on the front line alongside the military as infantrymen in the trenches.\n\nAs the Imperial Japanese Army overwhelmed the defending forces, it was the Senior Service that was called upon to extract the Chinese Military Mission led by Admiral Chan Chak from Hong Kong. The 2nd MTB Flotilla accomplished this most dramatic saga on Christmas Day 1941 following the fiasco in Aberdeen Channel. They endured murderous machine gun fire in broad daylight tearing their flimsy craft apart, followed by non-stop bursts as they swam for their very lives towards the nearest isle.\n\nFifty four year old Cmdr Hugh Montague RN (Ret) also escaped with a crew of two officers and four ratings after salvaging the yellow funneled Dockyard diesel launch C.410 in Aberdeen Channel, and joined up with the MTB's in Mirs Bay the following day.\n\nFollowing secret negotiation with a Chinese gang ruffians who survived on the proceeds of piracy & smuggling, they landed deep behind enemy lines on the Dapeng Peninsula in Mirs Bay.\n\nCarrying fifty-sixty pound packs over mountainous terrain and fording rivers they endured four days and nights of forced marching, passing through the Japanese lines, all the time being guided by the Chinese Guerrillas. They finally reached the relative safety of the bombed out city of Waichow now Huizhou in Free China, being subjected to yet another air raid. Some had bullet wounds, others injuries picked up during the march, with more suffering severe illness. Some had footwear that fitted, some not.\n\nIt was the beginning of a nineteen thousand seven hundred mile odyssey, with 3000 miles of hostile mountainous terrain across southern China and Burma by foot, river, truck, and train, all the time being targeted by Japanese bombers. They encountered the harsh Chinese winter, sometimes sleeping rough out in the open, in cleared out floating brothels, and even places with bubonic plague.\n\nFinally they reached their goal, Rangoon in Burma. They had triumphed over adversity only to be confronted with the Japanese invading forces in that place and were forced to escape all over again, sailing out right through the inbound Japanese armada.\n\nOf the sixty eight men who landed at NanAo deep behind enemy lines on the Dapeng Peninsula in Mirs Bay, sixty four survived the war to witness peace again, some were back to witness the Japanese surrender in Hong Kong in 1945. Others went on to hold high office as Law makers, Governors, Mayors, and an Olympic Committee Member. One went on to be hailed as arguably the most famous Coastal Forces Commanding Officer of WW II.\n\nThe flotilla & escape party were honored with twenty one awards for their exploits in Hong Kong and subsequent escape\n\n1 K.B.E. 1 C.B.E. 1 M.B.E. 2 O.B.E.s 2 D.S.C.s 14 M.i.Ds. 1 KGC.\n\n7th Dec 1941 (Sun)\n\nEddie Brazel HKRNVR \"All the land volunteers received their mobilisation orders, which were to be completed by 10.00 hrs the following day.\" [46]\n\n8th Dec 1941 (Mon)\n\nShips Log (MTB 07) \"07.30 Monoplane, 10,000 feet; course 180o, Overhead.\" [5]\n\nChan had been woken in the early hours and informed of the Japanese invasion of Malaya, followed two hours later with the attack on Pearl Harbour. He in turn roused his family and made an early start, catching the Star ferry to the Island city of Victoria Chan took his family to Henry Hsu's house. During the crossing the Imperial Japanese Air force (IJA) attacked Kai Tak airport in neutral Hong Kong. The local time was 08.00 hours and Chan and his family had a clear view of the Twelve Tachikawa Ki-36 \"Ida\" Army bombers of the 45th Sentai based at Canton escorted by nine Ki-27 \"Nate\" fighters attack on Kai Tak airport, Kowloon. The Idas bomb from low level, while the Nates strafe. They destroyed all the planes at Kai Tak airdrome including the Pan Am Hong Kong Clipper preparing to take off from Kowloon Bay. The Japanese simultaneously invaded the New Territories with an overwhelming ground force outnumbering the allied troops 4-1. At the same time an Imperial Japanese battle-fleet carrying more than three hundred planes attacked Pearl Harbour. Winston Churchill was dining at Chequers with the US Ambassador and special envoy when he received the news. Churchill telephoned President Roosevelt who remarked \"we are all in the same boat now\". Churchill had wooed, cajoled, and flattered Roosevelt since the beginning of the European conflict had started in 1939 and following his phone call with FDR he recorded “Being saturated and satiated with emotion and sensation, I went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful.” In the early hours Churchill was informed that that the Imperial Japanese army had invaded Hong Kong and bombed Kai Tak airdrome. The Japanese Military High Command, not the Imperial Japanese Government, declared that a stae of war existed with Great Britain and the United States of America.\n\nA Pan Am Sikorsky S-42 similar to the Hong Kong Clipper destroyed by bombing as it prepared to take off from Kowloon Bay\n\nGordon E Torrey \"I finally got a passage booked on a vessel called \"Kung Sang\" sailing from Hong Kong 8th Dec 1941.

Later that morning they were all shifted round to Aberdeen where they were moored single line ahead and presented such a target that of course we had two raids the following day with one or two near misses. After that all ships were transferred to Deep Water Bay with the “Cornflower” as H.Q.\" [56]\n\nSq-Ldr Max Oxford RAF \"During 17 days of fighting we had no air support, but Gen Chiang Kai-Shek kindly offered to send a Chinese Air Force to help us, and we were very happy to see them.\" [85]\n\nGen Chiang Kai-Shek sent planes from the China National Aviation Company (ROCAC), to evacuate Chinese VIP's including Madam Sun Yat-Sen with her sister Soong Ai-ling and her husband, the KMT Finance Minister H.H. Kung. They were escorted to Kai Tak by Two-gun Cohen. The eight American pilots flew a total of sixteen sorties evacuating 275 persons under cover of darkness to Chungking between the 8th and 10th December.\n\nGeneral Zheng, a staff officer from Chungking, along with Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Owen-Hughes made the last flight out. Owen-Hughes took on the role of liaison officer to the Chinese military in Chungking. The pilot's were Charles L. Sharp, Hugh L. Woods, Harold A. Sweet, William McDonald, Frank L. Higgs, Robert S. Angle, P.W. Kessler and S.E. Scott. [95]\n\nJean Moore: A member of the Hong Kong Volunteers, Lt-Col Harry Owen Hughes, had been flown out of Hong Kong to act as liaison officer with the Chinese military. We invited him to stay in our home and a delightful guest he proved to be. Every morning, attired in Moois sports jacket, as he had left Hong Kong in uniform, he would borrow a bicycle and ride along the river bank to military headquarters.

Gangs were sent around the streets to pick up all cars and drive them to car dumps, the main reason being to clear the streets for essential traffic, and secondly so that those authorised to drive could go to the dump and pick up a car. In effect, as cars were damaged by shell fire or collision, got flat tyres or run-down batteries, they were simply left for wrecking crews to pick up, and the drivers went to the dump for another one.\" [28]\n\nSimilarly all marine vessels requisitioned for use by the navy and military.\n\nTed Ross MoI \"I picked myself a peach of a big new Buick Special. Glass and debris littered all the main streets, but none were completely blocked.\n\nWe used it for everything; dashing up to headquarters three times a day for communiqués, distributing leaflets and pamphlets, picking up gasoline, oil, and food supplies.\n\nI drove it right through the siege, through streets littered with debris, broken glass and hanging trolley wires, and never even got a puncture.\" [28]\n\nChan Chak decided the only way to control the Triads on the island was to raise money to out-pay the Japanese.

There was considerable bombing and shelling of Aberdeen and a determined bombing attack on HMS CICALA which had been firing on enemy batteries on the hills above Repulse Bay. At about 10.00 Hrs nine bombers attacked Cicala and the ninth scored hits with a straddle of 5 bombs which holed her but did not explode to any great extent. MTB 10 received signal to all MTB's from SNO Aberdeen Cicala on fire, take off crew and proceeded alongside taking off all officers and crew, and on consulting with the Commanding Officer, Lt Commander John Boldero, R.N. (retd) MTB 09 was instructed to hasten the sinking of Cicala with depth charges and this was done. After putting crew of Cicala (some wounded) on shore at T-head pier, MTB 10 proceeded down Aberdeen Channel to contact the Flotilla and at the narrowest part came under shell fire which wounded the 1st Lt who was landed, and CPO Gilbert Thums D/J 96352 late Coxswain of the CICALA, taken in his place, together with a Telegraphist from CICALA to cope with V2's W/T work. As I had been Commanding Officer of Cicala from May 1940 to April 1941 I was well acquainted with this Chief P.O. and found him of great assistance to me particularly in his cheerful and tactful attitude to officers and ratings.

Constant interruption of shelling and bombing, and here at last my first impressions of the Navy acquired during our first visit to the Aberdeen H. Q. were completely dispelled. Here was the best morale I had seen, and that too among men who had, in their frailest of craft, no protection against shells or bombs, except wits, courage— and Lewis guns for any low flying craft.\n\nMoored as they were, all one could do was duck and hope —yet the atmosphere was most cheerful, and the relationship between officers and men most pleasant. I made my first acquaintance with those heavenly twins 'Navy Rum and Navy Tobacco whose praises should be sung in verse and not in mere prose.\n\nThe news came that the whole flotilla — or rather what was left of it, was coming on our expedition and the same evening the crews were given an idea of what was afoot, and advice on 'kit requirements'. There they were, 'all sailors' many of whom we found later had done practically no walking, looking forward with equanimity to the prospect of becoming guerillas.\n\nPacking of kit required a fair amount of tact, since each man took a deal of persuading that a load of 50 lbs. would weigh heavily even on a stalwart pair of shoulders after a few miles. Still the packing was done and the most difficult part of the business now was in trying to cool their ardour and make them see that, quite probably, they would not move off the next minute.\" [11]\n\n22nd December 1941 (Mon)\n\nLt-Cdr Gandy RN (Ret) (MTB 10) \"Other MTB's this day prepared stores and arms for possible escape.

To the anxious onlookes all seemed to be over, when out through the curtain of spray dashed the 'Bedpan', but with no sign of Pethick.

We therefore had to anchor all over the place, behind little islands and in little coves, changing our position several times a day to avoid being spotted by enemy planes.\n\nI imagine that there was hardly an hour during those last few weeks when there was not an enemy plane in the sky somewhere. That meant that we had to keep a constant lookout and the guns manned nearly all the time. We got precious little peace or rest as we were three hours on, three hours off on watch.\" [18]\n\nThe MTB's were stood down from front-line duty and put on immediate 24/7 notice with Mr F.W.K.
