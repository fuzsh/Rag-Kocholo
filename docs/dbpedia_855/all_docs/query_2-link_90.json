        "text": "This post may contain affiliate links.\n\nHong Kong is the perfect place for an obsessive shopper, especially when it comes to designer outlet shopping. Here’s my experience, and a guide to the best outlet stores and factory outlet locations.\n\nUpdated 2019\n\nHong Kong outlet stores\n\nIf you’re in Hong Kong, and designer bargains are on your mind, how can you not want to shop? Hong Kong is like crack for shopaholics. Many designers have their clothes made in China and factory outlets are where overruns, excess stock and seconds go to die.\n\nWhen I used to teach English in Korea, I’d make regular pilgrimages here to outlets like the Kaiser Estates for deals on Armani and Anne Klein, and there was no better cure for travel burnout. But you have to keep up with the times. These days, old favourites like the Kaiser Estates and the Pedder Building have been trumped by newer, shinier places, though some old standbys still remain.\n\nOn my last trip to Hong Kong, I received an updated version of what’s new on the Hong Kong factory outlet scene and where to find designer discounts, and now I’m sharing my experience with you.\n\nPreplanning is essential when outlet shopping in Hong Kong\n\nSince factory outlets in Hong Kong are spread far and wide, preplanning is necessary. So, armed with a list of Hong Kong shopping factory outlets, I showed it to the concierge at my hotel, the Island Shangri-la Hong Kong.\n\nTactfully, he advised me to refresh my itinerary, suggesting Horizon Plaza and the Prada Miu Miu Outlet (formerly called Space Warehouse) in the area of Aberdeen.\n\nFor a minute I brushed him aside. I didn’t want to go to Aberdeen. On the south shore of the island, it’s an area known for its floating seafood restaurants and picturesque fishing boats. The only cheap shopping I knew of in the south was Stanley Market, better for souvenirs and bargain T-shirts than high-end designer goods. And it was a good distance away.\n\nAn expert’s advice\n\nThe concierge read me like a shopping flyer. “The Prada outlet,” he repeated.\n\nWhy didn’t he say so before? Or maybe he had and I just hadn’t been listening. Grabbing the mimeographed map he was offering me, I tore out the door shouting, “Taxi!”\n\nThe driver took me to a fairly modern building in a residential area. Where the heck am I, I wondered? I strode up the steps and landed in a dentist’s office.\n\nBacktracking I found a discreet sign for Prada and Miu Miu with an arrow pointing around the corner. From the smattering of chic Asian couples going inside, I knew I’d found the right place.\n\nI’ve never met a Prada outlet I didn’t like\n\n“Prices are 20% cheaper here than in regular Prada stores,” I heard a salesman tell a customer.\n\nEven that would be stretching my wallet, but surely one splurge could be excused. After all, it’s an investment, I told myself. I’ll probably be able to resell it in a few years for a profit. And that’s only the regular prices. I was after an even bigger deal.\n\nI aimed for the purses and stopped to caress the soft leather of a amber-coloured purse. It fit under my arm nicely and the logo was tasteful rather than in-your-face. Was it a love match? I wasn’t sure.\n\nAnd here lies the dilemma of shopping at Hong Kong outlet stores for designer discounts. If I didn’t buy it now, it would be out of my hands forever. I’d never have time to make it back to the Prada Miu Miu outlet as it’s not exactly near my hotel.\n\nBut. If I bought it and found something I liked better down the road it would be a costly mistake. Gambling on cheaper bargains elsewhere, I moved on.\n\nHorizon Plaza Hong Kong\n\nA five-minute cab ride from the Prada Miu Miu Outlet took me to Horizon Plaza, a huge warehouse complex. Since the Prada outlet is close to Horizon Plaza, if you’re going to visit one, you might as well visit both.\n\nThe Horizon Plaza is in Ap Lei Chau, an island off the south of Hong Kong, and is known for its discount designer fashions as well as furniture stores.\n\nThis spacious collection of factory outlet shops is located in a converted warehouse building, and its 25 floors hold almost 100 shops.\n\nThese include:\n\nThe Ermenegildo Zegna Outlet Store, which is a high-end men’s clothing store from Italy.\n\nThe I.T. Outlet, a trendy fashion boutique that sells a number of international brands at discounts.\n\nSaint Laurent\n\nRalph Laurent\n\nMax Mara\n\nThe Swank Outlet and so many more.\n\nOn the 25th floor at Lane Crawford, Hong Kong’s answer to Saks Fifth Avenue, I scooped up a tiered cream skirt for $10. It’s was a dream bargain, but only an appetizer, a warm up for bigger and better deals to come. At least that’s what I hoped.\n\nMethodically I shopped through each outlet but even a trim green jacket at the popular Joyce Warehouse wasn’t as tempting as the amber-coloured Prada bag I’d left behind.\n\nDesigner outlet shopping is exhausting\n\nSeveral hours later, my legs were aching and my vision was blurred. Too tired to continue, I took a cab back to my hotel for some much-needed downtime.\n\nWe were almost at the hotel when I spotted the Pedder Building, a pre-war colonial structure from 1923. One of my old outlet haunts, it used to house several floors of small outlet shops above the (non-outlet) Shanghai Tang department store.\n\n“Stop!” I shouted.\n\nIt was nearly closing time so I raced inside and rifled through racks. A Burberry-style jacket with ¾ length sleeves and a cut out label almost won me over, but I knew it wasn’t me. While the Pedder Building has few bargains these days, it’s central location and still fun to rifle through the boutiques.\n\n“This is like a treasure hunt,” an American girl said as we trooped down the stairwell in tandem.\n\nThe hunt for factory outlet bargains\n\nOutlet shopping in Hong Kong is a lot more fun if you find treasure, though. And I wasn’t having much luck.\n\nI began to have visions of that Prada handbag back at the Prada Outlet. As I faced the prospect of leaving Hong Kong with only one measly cream skirt, the Prada bag I’d left behind began to assume mythic proportions. With sudden clarity I saw how my life would change for the better with a chic Prada handbag.\n\nIn desperation, I phoned the Prada Miu Miu Outlet back in Aberdeen. If they opened early enough the next day, I could get there before my mid-morning flight.\n\n“Sorry, we open at 10,” said the salesman.\n\nFoiled! Back at the Shangri-la, I soaked out my dejection in the outdoor Jacuzzi. Surrounded by gleaming high rises and city lights, I perked up.\n\nEven if I was leaving without a suitcase of designer bargains, Hong Kong is still a fantastic place to shop. Plus, if I got to the airport early enough I’d have time to go to the Citygate Outlet Mall nearby. And, if all else failed, there was always duty free."
