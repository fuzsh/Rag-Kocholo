        "text": "In recent days, Hong Kong has gotten into heated discussions on the review of its school textbooks to correct past mistakes or inaccuracies. One major correction centres on the factual statement that “Hong Kong was not a colony”. I would like to examine this issue from the perspective of international law.\n\nUN Deleted Hong Kong from the list of colonies in 1972\n\nOn 8 March 1972, China’s permanent representative at the United Nations (“UN”) wrote a letter to the chairman of the UN’s Decolonization Committee, reiterating China’s long-standing view regarding the questions about Hong Kong and Macau. The letter pointed out that both cities were Chinese territories forcibly occupied by Britain and Portugal respectively, and as such can not be categorised as “colonies”. Consequently, both cities should be excluded from the list of colonies covered by the UN Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples (“the Declaration”). The UN Special Committee on Decolonization concurred and on 15 June of the same year passed a resolution that struck Hong Kong and Macau from the list of colonies. On 8 November of that year, the 27th UN General Assembly, by a vote of 99 in favour and 5 opposed (which includes the US, the UK, France, Portugal and South Africa), passed the resolution, reaffirming China’s position and accepting its demands on this issue.\n\nBorrowed Place Borrowed Time\n\nThe Preamble of Hong Kong SAR Basic Law (“Basic Law”) states, “Hong Kong has been part of the territory of China since ancient times; it was occupied by Britain after Opium War in 1840……Upholding national unity and territorial integrity, maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and taking account of its history and realities, the People’s Republic of China has decided that upon China’s resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, a Hong Kong Special Administration Region will be established in accordance with the provisions of Article 31 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, and that under the principle of “one country, two systems”……”\n\nIt is noteworthy that on 1 July 1997, Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China came about not by China’s “taking over the sovereignty” but by “resuming the exercise of sovereignty”. It is a “transfer of power”, not a “transfer of sovereignty”. China always claims sovereignty over Hong Kong. Even when Hong Kong was occupied and ruled by Britain from 1842 to 1997, China only recognised that Hong Kong was under British rule but Britain never assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong. One must note that, every single word in the Basic Law was articulately chosen to reflect the exact position of Hong Kong in history. Richard Hughes once described Hong Kong as “the Borrowed Place, the Borrowed Time”.[1] “Resuming the exercise of sovereignty” in the Basic Law carries the meaning that China has never lost the sovereignty of Hong Kong.\n\nInternational law does not recognize unequal treaties signed under force\n\nHistory records dated as far back as 4000 BC suggest that our Chinese ancestors had lived and worked on the land in Hong Kong. Chinese troops were garrisoned here and charged with carrying out maritime patrols. This is proof that since time immemorial Hong Kong has been Chinese territory. It was forcibly occupied by the British as a result of its acts of aggression that led to the imposition of three unequal treaties on China. The first was the Treaty of Nanking between the Qing dynasty and Britain on 29 August 1842 whereby Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in perpetuity. The second was the Treaty of Peking on 24 October 1860, whereby Kowloon to the South of Boundary Street was ceded to Britain in perpetuity. The third treaty was signed on 9 June 1898. Britain, on the pretext of gaining parity of power with France, forced the Qing dynasty to accept the Treaty covering Kowloon to the North of Boundary Street and the New Territories and all the surrounding offshore small islands under a lease of 99 years in 1898.\n\nAccording to Article 2(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention”) agreed upon in Vienna on 23 May 1969, “” treaty” means an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation”. Vienna Convention in its introduction recognizes \" the ever-increasing importance of treaties as a source of international law and as a means of developing peaceful co-operation among nations , whatever their constitutional and social systems , noting that the principles of free consent and of good faith and the pacta sunt servanda rules are universally recognized ; affirming the disputes concerning treaties, like other international disputes , should be settled by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law; recalling the determination of the peoples of the United Nations to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties can be maintained ; having in mind the principles of international law embodied to the Charter of the United Nations such as the principles of the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, of sovereign equality and independence of all States , of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States and prohibition of the threat or use of force ...”\n\nViewing these fundamental principles of a valid treaty in the Vienna Convention, it is not difficult for one to see that the three treaties concerning Hong Kong which China was forced to enter in 1842, 1860 and 1898 under Opium War were not in accord with the above principles of “free consent and good faith”.\n\nArticle 52 of the Vienna Convention states, \" A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. \"\n\nThe three treaties concerning Hong Kong all resulted from military aggression. Successive Chinese governments had never recognized these treaties. Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other nations is the cornerstone of international law. These treaties were the product of military plunder by Britain and are therefore in serious contravention of international law. It is a clearcut case that they are invalid from the perspectives of international law.\n\nOne should also note that self-determination in the Vienna Convention is based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. The self-determination of China as one sovereign country refers to 1.4 billion people of the mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as one whole piece.\n\nClear UN Resolution\n\nChina has insisted that it has always possessed sovereignty over Hong Kong. Upon the founding of the new China in 1949, the Chinese government consistently declared that Hong Kong is an integral part of Chinese territory, that it does not recognize the validity of the three unequal treaties, and when conditions are ripe, China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. During a visit to Beijing by a delegation of Chinese and foreign professors from the University of Hong Kong on 27 December 1955, Premier Zhou En-lai made the point clear that Hong Kong had always belonged to China, even though it was occupied by Britain and was temporarily under British rule at that time. In the early 1960’s the UN General Assembly passed the declaration giving people in colonial territories independence, directing that all manner of colonialism must be expeditiously and unconditionally terminated, so that colonies could march towards freedom and independence. Nonetheless, the British government promptly declared that the action taken by the UN General Assembly in no way affected its legal status in Hong Kong. This position of Britain in 1960’s in fact confirmed the position of the Chinese government internationally. It pointedly declared that in the UN record of colonies did not include Hong Kong and Macau as both cities had never been colonies.\n\nMoreover, UN Resolution no. 2908 stated, “…the Special Committee agreed that it should recommend to the General Assembly the exclusion of Hong Kong and Macau and dependencies from the list which the Declaration applies…”\n\nThe UN’s resolution no. 2908 is a clear record in international law that:\n\nHong Kong and Macau did not belong to UN-recognized colonies;\n\nHong Kong and Macau never enjoy the right of self-determination as colonies stated in the UN declaration;\n\nIt is only up to the sovereign country China to resolve governance issues of Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nTherefore, Hong Kong was not a colony before the handover is not only a political claim but also an international legal fact."
