        "text": "The Beginning of the Hong Kong Post Office\n\nThe First Postage Stamps\n\nIn 1862, Hong Kong issued its own postage stamps for the first time. Bearing the head of Queen Victoria, they came in denominations ranging from two cents to 96 cents. Their use became compulsory by 1864.\n\nHong Kong Joined the Universal Postal Union\n\nIn 1877, Hong Kong joined the Universal Postal Union (UPU). By 1879, the postage rates to any country in the UPU from Hong Kong was a flat rate of ten cents, a six-cent drop in price.\n\nThe First Commemorative Stamp\n\nHong Kong celebrated its 50th Anniversary as a British colony in 1891. To mark the occasion, the Post Office issued a commemorative stamp, a limited edition of the two-cent carmine Queen's head, overprinted with \"1841 Hong Kong Jubilee 1891\".\n\nPosting Boxes\n\nThe posting boxes in Hong Kong came into existence back in the Victorian days. The boxes in those days bore the royal cypher \"VR\" (the monogram for Victoria Regina). The surviving Victorian posting boxes is now on display at the Hong Kong Museum of History and the Postal Gallery in the General Post Office.\n\nThe Oldest Post Office still in service\n\nStanley Post Office, which has been in operation since 1937, is the oldest post office still in service. It is in its original building situated at 2 Wong Ma Kok Road. Refurbisment works were carried out in 2007 to restore Stanley Post Office to its original condition.\n\nOpening of Central Mail Centre\n\nThe Central Mail Centre in Kowloon Bay was fully commissioned in October 2014.It amalgamates the International Mail Centre in Hung Hom and the sorting office at the General Post Office in Central into a unified postal facility. Adopting a green building design, the Central Mail Centre is installed with advanced postal equipment, which helps enhances operational efficiency.\n\nLooking ahead, pursuant to the mission of \"Linking People, Delivering Business\", Hongkong Post will continue to provide a diverse range of products and services to the public and corporate clients in response to their service needs."
