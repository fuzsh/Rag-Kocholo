Some nice fountains and flowerscapes complete the experience.”\n\n“I hate shopping but this place was great, mostly outdoors and you just hop from shop to shop…. They have everything you didn’t know you needed.”\n\n“Adorable fun place to visit, shop and dine… You are allowed to walk with a drink in your hand here, which is nice on a beautiful day.”\n\n“I am from Virginia and this was my first time at Peddler’s Village. There were so many shops I didn’t even get to see them all. This is definitely more than a one-day adventure. There are several food vendors to choose from. I had tons of shopping bags and a full belly when I left. Can’t wait to go back again.”"
