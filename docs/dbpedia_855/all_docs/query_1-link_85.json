        "text": "At 13 Central and Tsim Sha Tsui sites residents and visitors will be able to peek into history and compare the locations with the present at the same time, made possible through a combination of multimedia and augmented reality, that can be accessed online and at the sites during a walk.\n\nThis is being made possible by the Tourism Commission, which joined hands with City University of Hong Kong. They have rolled out the 'City in Time,' app which offers a panoramic comparison of Hong Kong sites then and now.\n\nThe AR markers seen on a street pole can be located on the internet.\n\nA resident or a visitor on a stroll in Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, can point a smartphone at the QR code on the AR marker and download the app. Point the device at the clock-like feature to activate the information about that site. One can compare the existing view with that of a 3D rendering of the historical view.\n\nThe mobile app also has a selfie function. Users can also understand more about the history of Hong Kong by browsing photos and information of the iconic spots with the mobile app, the Tourism Commission says.\n\nThere are seven sites in Central and six in Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\nThe seven locations in Central are Edinburgh Place, Chater Road (near the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong), Des Voeux Road Central (near Chater Garden), Statue Square, Pedder Street (near World-Wide House), Hollywood Road (near PMQ) and Pottinger Street (near Tai Kwun), while the six locations in Tsim Sha Tsui are Kowloon Park Drive (near the YMCA of Hong Kong), Nathan Road (near the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel & Towers), Salisbury Garden, Salisbury Road (near the Hong Kong Cultural Centre), the Former Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower and the Tsim Sha Tsui Waterfront Promenade.\n\nThe mobile app is available for free download at the Apple App Store and Google Play. Locals and tourists can also embark on virtual journeys on the City in Time website (cityintime.hk).\n\nThe Yeung Kin Man Chair Professor of Media Art at the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Jeffrey Shaw, and his team were commissioned by the Tourism Commission to develop and produce the City in Time project."
