        "text": "This collection of essays explores the development and legacy of British colonialism in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong’s place in Chinese history from the mid-Qing through the Republican and PRC eras. After a substantial introduction by the editor, the nine contributors to this volume analyze (1) the formation and vestiges of British colonialism in Hong Kong, (2) Hong Kong’s role in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century history of the British empire, the Qing dynasty, and subsequent Chinese governments, and (3) the incorporation of Hong Kong into the PRC in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Their detailed essays critically document the political and cultural processes by which colonial structures were constructed and maintained in Hong Kong under British rule. They also offer illuminating analysis of the discourses on “reunification” that have played out in Hong Kong in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and the aptness of recent characterizations of Hong Kong’s recent history as a process of \"recolonization.\"\n\nContributors:\n\nKaori Abe holds a Ph.D. in history from the University of Bristol and is a former postdoctoral fellow at Nanyang Technological University.\n\nSonia Lam-Knott is a postdoctoral fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore, and a postdoctoral associate at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, University of Oxford.\n\nCarol A.G.
