        "text": "Founded in the early 1830s, the Jardine Matheson Group has been one of Asia's most dynamic trading companies for nearly two centuries, adapting and reinventing itself in the face of both challenges and opportunities in order to survive and prosper. The Group has developed a market-leading portfolio of businesses and has grown and evolved with the communities in which it operates.\n\nThese historical chapters chronicle a selection of key milestones, major developments and achievements of a very unique company.\n\n1832\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1832\n\nJardine, Matheson & Co (JM & Co) was founded in Canton in July 1832 by Scots William Jardine and James Matheson. Following the end of the East India Company’s trading monopoly with China, Jardine Matheson sent its first private shipments of tea to England in 1834.\n\n1839\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1839\n\nJM & Co saw the development potential of Hong Kong as a trading base and moved its operations temporarily from Macao to Hong Kong.\n\n1841\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1841\n\nJM & Co purchased the first plots of land at East Point for £565. The Firm's Chinese name 'Ewo' – 'the state of happy harmony' – was adopted the following year.\n\n1844\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1844\n\nJM & Co completed the move of its main office to Hong Kong and opened its office in Shanghai when it purchased Lot No. 1 in 1844. More offices were subsequently opened in Canton, Amoy and Foochow.\n\n1855\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1855\n\nJM & Co inaugurated the steamer cargo line from Calcutta to the Far East. The Firm became the first foreign trading house to establish in Japan by acquiring Lot No. 1 in the first Yokohama land sale. Offices were later opened in Kobe, Nagasaki and other ports.\n\n1864\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1864\n\nIn the 1860s, JM & Co’s trading activities were enhanced by the expansion of its shipping, banking and insurance interests. The Firm moved its main office from East Point to Central Hong Kong in 1864.\n\n1889\n\nEarly Trading Years, Building Hong Kong as a Trading Port\n\n1889\n\nSir Paul Chater, in partnership with JM & Co, formed Hongkong Land.\n\n1906\n\nBusiness Transformation and Regional Expansion\n\n1906\n\nJM & Co became a limited company. British & Chinese Corporation (BCC), formed by JM & Co and HSBC, signed a contract for the construction of the Kowloon-Canton railway the following year. In 1908 BCC signed a contract for the construction of the Shanghai-Nanking Railway.\n\n1923\n\nBusiness Transformation and Regional Expansion\n\n1923\n\nJardine Engineering Company (JEC) was formed in Shanghai, playing a major role in providing machinery, equipment and services for the growing infrastructure developments in Hong Kong and Chinese mainland. In the same year, the sale of part of east Point was completed and the Tokyo earthquake demolished JM & Co’s Yokohama office.\n\n1930\n\nBusiness Transformation and Regional Expansion\n\n1930\n\nBy 1930, JM & Co’s main offices were in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In this year, JEC installed the first lift in Tianjin, China, while in the following year the first Schindler lift was installed in Hong Kong. JEC also pioneered ammonia-type air-conditioners and led in the areas of heating and sanitation during this time.\n\n1941\n\nBusiness Transformation and Regional Expansion\n\n1941\n\nThe entry of Japan into the World War II forced the closure of JM & Co’s offices in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, although a presence was maintained in Chongqing.\n\n1947\n\nBusiness Transformation and Regional Expansion\n\n1947\n\nJM & Co was one of the first companies to resume operations in Hong Kong and Shanghai after the War. The Firm’s business in Japan was re-established and its shipping activities were also revived. In the same year, Jardine Airways was formed with one of the first clients being the forerunner of British Airways.\n\n1954\n\nBusiness Transformation and Regional Expansion\n\n1954\n\nJM & Co closed its offices in China. Nevertheless, the Firm maintained its links with the Mainland.\n\n1957\n\nDiversification\n\n1957\n\nDuring the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, the Group went through another period of transformation. Jardines’ head office returned to Hong Kong in 1957 and the old Jardine House on Pedder Street was replaced by the new one (now Wheelock House).\n\n1961\n\nDiversification\n\n1961\n\nJM & Co became a public company, with the initial offer oversubscribed by some 56 times.\n\n1963\n\nDiversification\n\n1963\n\nHongkong Land opened the Mandarin Hotel, while JM Australia began operations in Sydney.\n\n1964\n\nDiversification\n\n1964\n\nDairy Farm acquired the Wellcome grocery chain in Hong Kong.\n\n1970\n\nDiversification\n\n1970\n\nJM & Co pioneered merchant banking in Hong Kong and the region with the establishment of Jardine Fleming in a joint venture partnership with Robert Fleming. A representative office was opened in Jakarta in 1971.\n\n1972\n\nDiversification\n\n1972\n\nThe Excelsior hotel in Hong Kong was opened in 1972 at the site of Jardines’ original land purchase. This was followed by the acquisition of The Oriental, Bangkok in 1973 and hotels in Manila and Jakarta in 1976 and 1978.\n\n1974\n\nDiversification\n\n1974\n\nJM & Co moved its head office to Connaught Centre (renamed Jardine House in 1989). The Group opened a branch office in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n1975\n\nDiversification\n\n1975\n\nThe Firm acquired Gammon Construction, Hong Kong’s leading construction company, now a 50-50 joint venture with Balfour Beatty. It also acquired a majority stake in Zung Fu, Hong Kong’s Mercedes-Benz distributor, which became the core business of Jardine Motors.\n\n1979\n\nDiversification\n\n1979\n\nJardines was one of the first companies to re-establish relations with Chinese mainland with the opening of a representative office in Beijing in 1979, followed by offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\n1980\n\nDiversification\n\n1980\n\nThe first industrial joint venture in Chinese mainland was formed by Jardine Schindler, while Maxim's Caterers made history by entering the first joint venture providing air catering services in the Chinese mainland. In the same year, the Group acquired a 40% interest in Hongkong Land Co, cementing a closer relationship between the two companies.\n\n1981\n\nDiversification\n\n1981\n\nThe Group opened the first 7-Eleven convenience store in Hong Kong. A major insurance broking operation was acquired in San Francisco and the Group’s motor business was extended to the UK.\n\n1982\n\nDiversification\n\n1982\n\nJardines celebrated its 150th anniversary and established the Jardine Foundation offering scholarships to students from the region attend Oxford and Cambridge universities. The Jardine Ambassadors Programme was also launched, with the objective of providing young Jardines executives in Hong Kong with the opportunity to serve the community.\n\n1984\n\nDiversification\n\n1984\n\nJardine Matheson Holdings Limited (JMH) was formed as the Group’s holding company incorporated in Bermuda. The Group withdrew from ship-owning activities.\n\n1986\n\nBusiness Repositioning\n\n1986\n\nThe Group undertook a series of corporate moves in which Dairy Farm and Mandarin Oriental were listed in Hong Kong, and Jardine Strategic Holdings Limited (JSH) was formed to hold stakes in a number of Group companies.\n\n1987\n\nBusiness Repositioning\n\n1987\n\nJardines took on the Pizza Hut franchise in Hong Kong. The Group continued its expansion in consumer marketing with acquisition of the IKEA franchise in Hong Kong and a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz in Southern China.\n\n1990\n\nBusiness Repositioning\n\n1990\n\nJardine Matheson, Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm and Mandarin Oriental established their primary listings on the London Stock Exchange and Jardine Strategic was listed the following year, while the main Asian share trading activity moved to Singapore.
