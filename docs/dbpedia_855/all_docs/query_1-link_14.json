        "text": "Yes, we actually used to have castles in Hong Kong. Eucliffe (sometimes also spelt Eucliff), is one of the most famous castles belonging to millionaire Eu Tong Sen, occupying the entire western side of the cliff above Repulse Bay beach. Built in 1933, this 105,000-sq ft summer home, well known for its collection of antique western armour and stained glass windows, boasted three tall towers and vast grounds which contained swimming pools, tennis courts, and a greenhouse.\n\nEucliffe has seen its fair share of society balls, galas, and even fashion shows, as Hong Kong’s well-heeled and well-connected social circles frequented the spot, along with the neighbouring Repulse Bay Hotel owned by the Kadoorie family. With the opening of Repulse Bay Road, the area was easily accessible with a mere 20-minute drive from the city.\n\nAfter it was taken over by Japanese troops during the Occupation and later used as a filming location, the castle was eventually demolished in 1988 and the high-end residences of Royal Cliff, 56-58 Repulse Bay Road, now occupy the location where Eucliffe used to stand.\n\nThe General Post Office has had four different locations on Hong Kong Island since 1841. But its most iconic stood at the junction of Des Voeux Road and Pedder Street from 1911. Known as the ‘Old Lady of Pedder Street’, the Edwardian architecture, red bricks and granite made it stand out in Central. It was demolished to make way for the MTR station in 1976 and relocated to Connaught Place, where it stands today."
