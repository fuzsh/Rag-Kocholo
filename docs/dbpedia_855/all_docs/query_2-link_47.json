        "text": "Lan Kwai Fong Pictures\n\nLan Kwai Fong is located between Wyndham Street and D'Aguilar Street on Hong Kong Island. This Central hot spot is famous for its night scene and award-winning dining. As the most famous bar street in Hong Kong, 80 restaurants and bars are spread in this narrow L-shaped lane. Central, the economic and financial center of Hong Kong, has a concentration of foreign enterprises, multinational companies, government headquarters, and office buildings with famous attorneys. To get to know what the elites at those places look like after work, one is destined to go to Lan Kwai Fong.\n\nLan Kwai Fong is dominated by white collar workers and foreigners. The best time to view its energy is on Friday and Saturday nights, when it is most crowded with people looking for entertainment. Generally speaking, an evening here is divided into two parts: Happy Hour and Spree Hour. Happy Hour is for white collars from 17:00 to 21:00. To lure them, most bars offer promotions, such as buy one and get one free for drinks and half price for food. Spree Hour starts at 22:00 when many university students and foreigners join the group. Although it is a place mostly for white collars, it is not an expensive place to hang out. A glass of beer costs about HK$40 to HK$50, which is half price during Happy Hour. Fees are paid for the service, however, in most cases paid with service charges and tips.\n\nThe names and furnishings of dining places in this unique cultural district are all westernized. The bars have simple d√©cor, a bar, bar stools, and a bar cabinet with all kinds of beer and drinks. Wing Wah Lane is a gourmet street with many foreign cuisines, such as the Japan style sheet iron fever, Indian curry rice, and gourmet food from Malaysia and Thailand. English has historically been the social language of this district, yet with more and more mainland visitors, some bar waitresses have started to speak mandarin.\n\nWhen New Year's Eve, Christmas and other grand occasions come, there will be activities held along the streets in Lan Kwai Fong, such as game stalls, competitions, and entertainment performances. People also flock to this street to count down to a special moment. During All Saints' Day, people in disguise themselves as ghosts, horses, angels, devils and mummies. Visitors should not miss it if they come during the festival.\n\nPopular Bars\n\nA bar: La Doice Vita 97\n\nC Bar\n\nA small yet lively bar. The seats in front offer a view of the bustling crowds. Service hours last as long as 16 hours from 09:00 to 01:00 the next morning.\n\nFONG\n\nIn the heart of Lan Kwai Fong, the first floor has bar stools and the second floor has a glamorous lounge bar.\n\nPOST 97\n\nA classic brand, serving traditional British breakfasts and self-help drinks at night, each of which costs HK$97\n\nLa Doice Vita 97\n\nThe most popular bar. Offering Italian gourmet food during the day, it is a music bar at night with live shows each Thursday and Saturday.\n\nThe Whiskey Priest: An Ireland theme bar. It is a good place for live ball game broadcasts, serving authentic Irish dishes and black beer.\n\nConsumer Budget\n\nEach bottle of the beer cost HK$40 to HK$50 generally, but the cocktails favored by many women may range from HK$70 to HK$150. Some bars may charge an admission fee, changeable with the time period and ranging from HK$150 to HK$400, so ask about the charges before going into any one of the bars. Some bars also have Ladies' Night, when ladies get free admission or a free drink.\n\nOpening Hours\n\nBars in Lan Kwai Fong\n\nMost bars in Lan Kwai Fong are closed during the daytime. It is advised for visitors to get there after 18:00 and stay until the next morning.\n\nHow to get to Lan Kwai Fong\n\nBy MTR\n\nTake Tsuen Wan Line or Island Line to Central, then exit from D1; turn right to Pedder Street and walk until you reach Queen's Road Central, turn left when you get to D'Aguilar Street, walk straight along D'Aguilar Street and you will reach there. It takes 10 minutes or so to walk. (Note that the MTR generally runs to half past 12 at night and starts at half past 5 in the morning, so visitors have to take a taxi if they stay too late.)\n\nBy Bus\n\nTake Bus 12, 12m, 13 or 40m to Lan Kwai Fong, D'Aguilar St.\n\nTake the Peak Tram down the hill and get on bus 15C at lower terminus. Alternatively, take minibus line 1 at the square of the peak, (the road is bumpy) and then walk about 10 minutes from the Central bus station."
