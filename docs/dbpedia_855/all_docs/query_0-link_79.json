        "text": "The Chinese phrase kuli (苦力), meaning those who engage in hard labour, was the origin of the term “coolie trade”, a description used by Westerners to refer to businesses related to the recruitment and transportation of Chinese labourers. Even in present-day Hong Kong, the undertaking of gruelling labour is called being a guli (咕喱) in Cantonese, which is based on the words kuli and “coolie”.\n\nThe growing demand for labour from the expansion of capitalism in the West surged even further when gold was discovered in America and Australia in the mid-19th century. Meanwhile, many Chinese were forced to work in the Americas and Southeast Asia either for escaping poverty or being cheated or kidnapped during the late Qing era. The profiteering coolie trade was formed under these conditions. Most labour would receive a prepayment prior to leaving the country, although part of it was deducted by the middlemen who recruited them to pay for finders’ fees, ship passage, and other fees. The recruits were then at their handlers’ mercy and had no choice but to follow every order. They were treated much like livestock - the reason the coolie trade was also called the “pig trade” by Guangdong (廣東) locals.\n\nIn early years, Hong Kong was an important transfer station for the coolie trade, and most labour from southern China departed the country via Hong Kong. According to statistics, the number of coolies shipped to the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia between 1851 and 1872 reached 320,349. Many coolies lost their lives in foreign lands due to the terrible living and working conditions, and the harsh treatment. A great number died of disease while making the overseas voyage, and never arrived at their destinations. Ironically, this despicable coolie trade lined the pockets of its dealers."
