        "text": "Located in the historical Pedder Building at the heart of Central, Hong Kong, Club Bâtard, the highly anticipated new private members' club, is set to open this summer.\n\nSpanning three storeys with high ceilings, the club will occupy an expansive 18,000 square feet within this iconic heritage building. The heart and soul of the exclusive club will be Hong Kong’s largest walk-in wine cellar, offering more than five thousand references, all available to drink at the club’s bars and restaurants at retail prices without any restaurant markups.\n\nThe club is conceived by Michael Wu, founder of The Fine Wine Experience, Hong Kong’s leading wine merchant, and seasoned restaurateur Randy See, managing partner of Bâtard and Piccolo Concepts, a subsidiary of Singapore’s Les Amis Group.\n\nGlobal award-winning luxury hospitality designer Joyce Wang is leading the conversion. The Joyce Wang Studio’s design will refresh and revitalise the Beaux-Arts style Pedder Building, a landmark colonial era site, which first opened its doors 100 years ago, in 1924.\n\nClub Bâtard takes its name from restaurant Bâtard, the highly popular venue for French dining currently located within The Fine Wine Experience in Sai Ying Pun, which will relocate to Club Bâtard as one of the three restaurants open exclusively for members and their guests. The equally hard to book Hop Sze restaurant, famed for its traditional home-style Hong Kong specialties, will also relocate to Club Bâtard from Sai Wan Ho.\n\nThe third, Le Clos, will offer members all-day options, from breakfast and coffee meetings, lunches through to late night suppers, and evening drinks that feature cocktails crafted by Raphael Holzer. All three dining options are anchored by the 3-storey glass-fronted wine cellar, the centrepiece of Club Batârd.\n\nClub Batârd will also feature OBE, a whisky-focused bar that will present some of the world’s finest and rarest selections curated by former head of Whisky Asia at Bonhams, Diego Lanza. OBE stands for “Old Bottle Effect”, which is the bottle aging that occurs naturally over time in a whisky bottle. An experience we look bring to our members. The club will limit recruitment to just 1,200 members, offering a high level of access within the three spacious floors.\n\nClub Bâtard is currently offering a limited release of memberships at a special pre-opening joining fee rate of HK$100,000. The membership joining fee will thereafter be HK$150,000."
