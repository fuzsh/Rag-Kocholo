Named Victoria when the British first came in 1841, Central is now home to Hong's Kong's towering financial palaces as well as a number of colonial-era buildings, parks, churches and gardens.\n\nThe main east-west streets running through Central are Connaught Road, Des Voeux Road and Queen's Road. Arriving along the elevated walkway from the Star Ferry terminal, the soaring skyscrapers of high-finance tower above you.\n\nCentral's Buildings\n\nThe 88-story Two International Finance Centre (2 ifc) was once Hong Kong's tallest building at 415 meters and was completed in 2003. The building was designed by the Argentine architect Cesar Pelli. The adjacent One International Finance Centre (1 ifc) opened in 1998 and a swish shopping mall connects the two. The tallest building, presently, in Hong Kong is the The International Commerce Centre (ICC) at 484 meters with 108 floors in Kowloon, part of the Union Square project on top of Kowloon Station.\n\nThe Airport Express train for HKIA leaves from Hong Kong Station located in the ifc complex. Check-in facilities are available on the premises.\n\nExchange Square\n\nExchange Square contains the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and faces Jardine House across Mau Yin Street.\n\nThe 180 meter-tall Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank (HSBC) skyscraper was the most expensive building in the world when it was completed in 1985. Designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster, the building makes impressive use of natural lighting in its vast atrium and the tower's cooling system is run on sea water. Two bronze lions guard the entrance to the bank.\n\nThe 300 meter high glass and steel Bank of China is the work of US architect I.M. Pei and was completed in 1990. There is a public viewing space on the 43rd floor that offers incredible views. Both the HSBC and Bank of China buildings were built with one eye on the principles of feng shui, though not without criticism from its staunchest adherents.\n\nStatue Square\n\nBelow the Bank of China building is the rather forlorn Statue Square, an area of empty space compared with the massive towers that surround it. The area contains the Cenotaph - a memorial to Hong Kong's war dead in World War I and II.\n\nTo the right is the colonial period Legislative Building, a domed, neoclassical building constructed in granite, that has served as Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) since 1985. Statue Square now has only one statue, that of banker Sir Thomas Jackson, as the others were melted down during the Japanese occupation in the 1940's. The square is now best known as a meeting place for Filipino migrant workers on weekends.\n\nBehind Statue Square and Chater Garden (a cricket pitch until the 1970s) lie the twin colonial buildings of the Court of Final Appeal and St. John's Cathedral - one of the oldest churches in Asia.\n\nCourt of Final Appeal\n\nThe Court of Final Appeal, the highest court in Hong Kong, is housed in the former French Mission Building dating originally from 1868. Walk along Battery Path along Cheung Kong Garden to reach both buildings. Climbing further up the steep hill is the old Government House and beyond that the pocket-sized Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens up from the Peak Tram terminal.\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) is located on Lower Albert Road. Since 1997, it has been the department responsible for the laws of Hong Kong headed by the Secretary for Justice. It is located at Department of Justice G/F, Main Wing, Justice Place, 18 Lower Albert Road, Central, Hong Kong.\n\nWest of Statue Square is the up-market shopping mall The Landmark (Tel: 2526 4416) - packed with designer stores: Dior, Gucci, Louis Vuitton et al. The retail section of the complex is in the Atrium with office space in the three towers of York House, Edinburgh Tower and Gloucester Tower.\n\nHeading up Pedder Street and Wyndham Street from Central MTR Station is the Lan Kwai Fong area of bars and restaurants. West of here is the SOHO area of more fashionable bars and eateries.\n\nThe Hong Kong Maritime Museum is a modern, interactive, and interesting museum at Pier 8 in Central.

Highlights of the museum include a ceramic model of a 2,000-year-old boat from the Han Dynasty and an early 19th century, 18-metre long, ink-painting scroll, Pacifying the South China Sea.\n\nEast of Central is Admiralty.\n\nCentral Market & Mid-Levels Escalator\n\nCentral Market was the first wet market in Hong Kong. It reopened in 2021 after 4 years of refurbishment with a mix of small shops, eateries, and public space. Nearby, the 800 meter-long Mid-Levels Escalator is the world's longest outdoor covered escalator and rises up over 130 meters. The Mid-Levels Escalator connects Des Voeux Road in Central with Conduit Road in Mid-Levels.\n\nCheung Kong Center\n\nCheung Kong Center was the third-highest skyscraper in Hong Kong at 283 meters (928 feet) when it opened in 1999. Designed by Argentine-American architect Cesar Pelli, it is the HQ of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited. Illuminated at night, the skyscrapers stands between the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building and the Bank of China Tower. The small but lovely Cheung Kong Park is nearby.\n\nCheung Kong Park\n\nAmongst the hustle and bustle of Central is a quiet and quaint public area known as Cheung Kong Park. The park is situated right next to Saint John's Cathedral and is just off from Queen's Road Central.\n\nSt. Paul's Church and Vicarage\n\nSt. Paul's Church and Vicarage (聖保羅堂) in Hong Kong was built in 1911 and is a grade 1 historical building. In terms of design, it is a mix of styles and these include Neo-Gothic with features and motifs drawn from Tudor, Dutch and Classical Revival architecture. Address: 1 Glenealy, Central.\n\nHelena May Building\n\nThe Helena May main building was constructed in 1914. It is a unique private members' social club which can be used for weddings and community events. It also has an extensive library and is well known for its fine dining facilities. It is still used by many people for high end parties and community events.\n\nThe building was officially opened on 12 September 1916 by Lady May, daughter of Lieutenant General George Digby Barker, British Commanding Officer in China and Hong Kong from 1890 to 1895. The building was seen as a respite and safe place for unaccompanied women arriving in Hong Kong for the first time; here they could meet people and socialize with others and build a community.\n\nAfter being the preserve for women for years, in 1985, the Helena May started accepting male members into its ranks.\n\nAddress: 35 Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong\n\nTai Kwun (大館)\n\nTai Kwun is a cultural and heritage complex located in Central. It occupies the site of the former Central Police Station, Central Magistracy, and Victoria Prison (see image above). The name \"Tai Kwun\" translates as \"big station\" in Cantonese, reflecting its historical significance as a law enforcement and judicial complex.\n\nThe revitalization project of Tai Kwun was completed in 2018 and transformed the historic buildings into a vibrant cultural hub. The restoration aimed to preserve the heritage value of the site while providing a space for arts, culture, and heritage appreciation.\n\nThe complex consists of 16 heritage buildings, including the Barrack Block, the Central Police Station, the former Victoria Prison, and the Magistracy. These buildings have been carefully restored and now house various cultural and artistic facilities. Tai Kwun offers a range of experiences for visitors, blending heritage, contemporary art, and lifestyle offerings.\n\nWithin Tai Kwun, you can find several art galleries, exhibition spaces, and performance venues. These showcase local and international contemporary art, as well as host exhibitions, installations, and cultural events. The complex also houses a range of dining options, from casual eateries to fine dining restaurants, offering a diverse culinary experience.\n\nTai Kwun is a good place to learn about Hong Kong's history. Visitors can explore the prison cells and pick up information on the city's legal system through guided tours and exhibitions. The site offers insights into the colonial past, the criminal justice system, and the social history of Hong Kong.\n\nApart from its cultural and heritage significance, Tai Kwun often serves as a venue for various community events, workshops, and educational programs. It aims to engage with the local community and promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of arts and culture.\n\nHotels in Central\n\nWan Chai to the east has a greater selection of hotels than Central where banks and office blocks take pride of place.
