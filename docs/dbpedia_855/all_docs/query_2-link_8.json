        "text": "Throughout the British colonial period, numerous architectures and landmarks were constructed with western influences, some of which are still standing in the urban city today. Check out some of the iconic 1900s landmarks below!\n\nVictoria Peak\n\nVictoria Peak or commonly known as just The Peak was primarily a place for summer homes, however when the tram was developed, it became more accessible so that people could live there throughout the year. As such, there was an upsurge in the number of expatriate residents at the Peak once the Peak Tram was developed. Extending 1,350 metres and connecting five intermediate stations, the Peak Tram, commenced its service on 30 May 1888, becoming the very first cable funicular in Asia. Today, the tram is still in operation, carrying enthusiastic tourists up to Victoria Peak to enjoy beautiful views of Hong Kong Island.\n\nPedder Street Clock Tower\n\nBefore the demolition in 1913, the Pedder Street Clock Tower was a notable landmark in the 1900s. This 80 feet tall, five-storey building was originally designed to house the town clock, later also served as a lookout to watch for fires in the city.\n\nTsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower\n\nCompleted in 1915, the 44-metre tall Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower was a part of the Kowloon-Canton Railway system. The clock tower was built using red bricks and granite in an Edwardian Classical Revival Style, and used the clock from the demolished Pedder Street Clock Tower. It is also the only part of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Station that remains today.\n\nExplore Hong Kong History with the Hong Kong Observation Wheel Augmented Reality App presented by AIA"
