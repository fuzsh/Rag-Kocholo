        "text": "The Maximum City is full of stories which will leave you mesmerised. Mumbai has transformed manifold over a period of time. Be it the popular food streets or simply the popular market areas, the city has much more to narrate than what meets the eye. Looking back in time, all these places have an interesting history. Strolling down the city streets, we do not realise what that place would have been like some decades back in time.\n\nThese widely familiar streets have a little story each behind their existence. Here’s what you would love to know:\n\n1. Dadabhai Naoroji Road\n\nFormerly known as Hornby Road, D.N. Road is the nerve center of Mumbai, South-bound starting from the Crawford Market and going all the way to the Flora Fountain via Victoria Terminus/CST. It is an arterial road in South Mumbai’s Fort area, adorned with neo-classical and gothic revival architecture.\n\nThis road is one of the busiest streets in Mumbai. It boasts off some classical and heritage buildings which one cannot ignore much. The sidewalks are lined up with local vendors selling pirated copies of books, movies and cassettes.\n\nIt was earlier named after the William Hornby, the Governor of Bombay back in 1771. The British East India Company built the Fort between 1686 and 1743, which was later demolished in 1860s to provide adequate space to meet the civic requirements. The area was re–structured and the small Hornby Road was converted into a broad avenue. The buildings today on the stretch are the remnants of the nineteenth century, which was famous for Victorian neo–Gothic, Indo–Sarcenic, neo–classical and Edwardian structures and architecture.\n\n2. Linking Road\n\nFormerly known as Dadabhai Navroji Road, Linking road is one of the most popular shopping destinations in Mumbai suburbs. This street in Bandra caters to all kinds of people, irrespective of their pocket sizes and budget. It is a heaven for shopaholics, offering both street shopping as well as international brands like Nike, Zara, Marks & Spencers, Skechers, etc.\n\nLinking Road has been one of the first few arterial roads connecting the Bandra and Juhu suburbs during the 1940s. This shopping hub expanded over the years. Starting from S.V Road in Bandra, the road continues to Khar, extending northwards to Santacruz and Juhu.\n\n3. Colaba Causeway\n\nOfficially known as Shahid Bhagat Singh road, Colaba Causeway is one of the first few shopping destinations a person visits when he lands in Mumbai.\n\nBack in time, it was the southern tip of Mumbai and was declared as the cantonment area. Constructions by the civilians was prohibited here in the past, thus making the Fort area and the other parts of erstwhile Mumbai excessively crowded. The architecture of this area showcases the remnants of old Mumbai.\n\nWhen the boat traffic in the area grew causing several deaths due to capsizing of overcrowded boats, the British East India Company constructed a causeway.\n\nIts was completed in 1838, using Old Woman’s Island. Hence, the last two islands of Colaba and Old Woman’s Island (out of the seven islands of Bombay) had been linked with the mainland of Mumbai back then. 4. Lamington Road\n\nThe official name of this road is Dr. Dadasaheb Bhadkamkar Marg but it is rarely used. It is named after the Governor of Bombay back in 1903, Lord Lamington. It is popular as the ‘IT hub of Mumbai’ as it deals with the wholesale and retail of electronics.\n\nShops here sell all electronic items from latest computer goods, television equipment, and wireless equipment to outdated electronic parts like transistors, capacitors, cables, sound cards, TV tuners at a much cheaper rate than usual.\n\n5. Peddar Road\n\nOfficially known as Dr. G. Deshmukh Marg and named after W. G. Pedder, the Municipal Commissioner (1879), it is a busy arterial road of South Mumbai, passing through the neighborhood of Cumballa Hill. It is said that it is resting on what was earlier known as Padam Hill. The present name, Gopalrao Deshmukh Marg, is after a social reformer but it is still popularly known as Peddar Road.\n\nIt’s popular landmarks include the Jaslok Hospital, Sophia College, Films Division of India, etc and is the residence for many renowned celebrities like Asha Bhosale, Lata Mangeshkar, Guru Dutt and many more.\n\n6. Bandra Promenade\n\nWith the Bandra Fort as one of the major attractions of the area, Bandra Promenade is one of the most popular sites in Mumbai. It has a kilometer long walkway beside the sea. It is less than a decade old is a popular jogging track and a park. It also has the amphitheater towards the Land's End side. It is also the venue for the Mumbai Festival, Celebrate Bandra and other such events. Many Bollywood stars like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, John Abraham, Shabana Azmi, Rekha, and Katrina Kaif are known to live here.\n\n7. Pali Hill\n\nRunning parallel to the Carter Road, Pali Hill is an affluent residential area of Bandra suburbs. It gets it name for the rolling hills on which it is situated, with the steep and mellow sides. It was originally an area of untamed forests and mildly cultivated orchards and today, even after years of deforestation, this area has much of greenery around. One can often witness a variety of migratory birds visiting the area.\n\nWith Candies and some other awesome cafes, Pali Hill is quite a happening street in Bandra.\n\n8. Hill Road\n\nIt is a popular shopping street in Bandra with both old and new brands and local vendors. Another popular road in the Bandra suburbs, Hill Road starts at the intersection of Railway station road and S.V. Road, going up to Mehboob Studios and leading to Bandra Promenade.\n\nBesides being popular amongst shopaholics, this place is also important to foodies with many renowned restaurants in the area. A few these include Lucky Restaurant, Elco Arcade, etc.\n\n9. Carter Road Promenade\n\nA kilometer-long walkway along the sea on the west side of Bandra, Carter Road is simultaneously a popular spot to hang out next to Bandstand Promenade. Besides a joggers’ park next to the sea, this place has amazing street food. It is the ultimate destination for some midnight munchings and is a heaven for any foodie.\n\nThe walkway here is 4,800 ft. long with a small chess-board ground, a vermicompost bed a large gazebo and solar and wind energy.\n\n10. Altamount Road\n\nParallel to Peddar Road, Altamount Road is an upmarket residential area in Bandra, both of which meet at the Kemp's Corner intersection. It was recently rates as the 10th most costly street in the world."
