        "meta_description": "For over half a century of British rule (1842-1997), Hong Kong was run by a colonial and business elite who focused on economic development and political stability through a laissez-faire policy, except during the Second World War Japanese occupation and the last years of colonial rule when democracy was being gradually introduced. After the Handover which took place on the 1st of July 1997, the government of Hong Kong had to adapt to an unprecedented geopolitical context which combined an economic, legal and social structure inherited from its colonial past and a Chinese institutional framework, known as “one country, two systems” within which the liberal economy and political autonomy of Hong Kong would coexist with the interventionism of the communist regime in Beijing. This article will focus on policy inputs especially in health and education, in the context of the historical transfer of the territory of Hong Kong from a British colony to a Special Administrative Region of the Chinese People’s Republic and will integrate the analysis of these inputs into the wider framework of the assessment of wellbeing issues in Hong Kong. These are indeed two key sectors concerning the wellbeing of the population. Besides they are major sources of concern for families in Hong Kong due to pressures from demography and structural changes in the labour market, integration with the mainland (pushing for adaptation of programs and use of standard Chinese) as well as cultural factors. The Chinese have always valued good health and perceived education as particularly important for upward social mobility and economic success. This article will first examine the areas of health and education in turn in the context of British colonial rule, and move on to explore the most recent developments in those areas since the Handover. It will then assess how specific factors (geography, history, politics) may have influenced policy and finally, it will conclude on the main challenges in terms of public policies which lay ahead to measure wellbeing in these fields.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n1Hong Kong lies on the eastern side of the Pearl River estuary in the Guangdong Province of Southern China. The territory is one of the most densely populated in the world, with a population of nearly 7.5 million living in an area of 1,104 per square kilometre (426 sq. mi.), in other words, the density of 6,300 people per square kilometre (World Population Review, 2019). According to the 2016 by-census, 93.6% of the population are ethnically Chinese and there are three official languages spoken (Cantonese, Mandarin and English).\n\n2As a British colony from 1842 to 1997, Hong Kong was set apart from neighbouring China and ruled by a Governor who headed an executive-led government with advisory and consultative bodies. The system aimed at business efficiency through laissez-faire policies, administrative legality and social order. As specified in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law which is the meaningful constitution post 1997 establishing the structure and responsibility of the local government, Hong Kong is now a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People’s Republic of China. The territory has a high degree of autonomy with full power over internal affairs. The purpose of these Sino-British constitutional arrangements was that the Hong Kong legal, economic and social systems would remain intact and distinct from those of Mainland China, under the “one country, two systems” principle which guarantees the territory's capitalist economic system and autonomous government for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty.\n\n4Wellbeing started being considered per se only recently in Hong Kong, through the concept of “quality of life”. This concept became a topic of discussion for academics worldwide and developed as a major concern for the public and the government in the 1960s. Indicators of quality of life have been used as “measures of social wellbeing, its achieved level and changes over time” (Chan et al., 2005: 260). Quality of life usually differs from standards of living which rely more on material satisfaction. In addition to life opportunities and satisfaction in basic needs, quality of life also includes “satisfaction in emotional needs, such as being satisfied with freedom, justice, and opportunities for the complete development of individual capabilities” (Chan et al., 2005: 260). Quality of life research deals with topics as varied as health, wellbeing, satisfaction, family, work, housing, social networks, political life amongst others (Chan et al., 2005).\n\n6This article will focus on policy inputs especially in health and education, in the context of the historical transfer from a British colony to a Special Administrative region of China and attempt to link them to the assessment of wellbeing in Hong Kong. These fields are major areas of concern for families due to pressures from changes in the labour market, upward mobility, integration with the mainland and an ageing population in the face of what some referred to as a “silver tsunami” where almost one in three Hong Kong residents will be aged 65 or above by 2041 (The 2015 Policy Address, Hong Kong). Wellbeing obviously does not limit itself to those two policy fields. Nevertheless, according to statistics from Measuring What Matters, a survey report which was part of a reflection on a debate on National Wellbeing (ONS, 2011), health is one of the top things people say matter for them. The World Health Organisation (WHO), for its part, states that “wellbeing exists in two dimensions, subjective and objective. It comprises an individual’s experience of their life as well as a comparison of life circumstances with social norms and values.” The British Department of Health ranks health and education at the top of its list of examples of life circumstances (HM Department of Health, 2014). From a Hong Kong point of view, the fields of health and education also seem worth studying as they were among the most impacted by the evolution from a colony to a Special Administrative Region of China. Hong Kong has had to compress nearly a century of healthcare and educational development in the West into the last three decades (The Harvard Team, 1999). This situation has been further exacerbated by the fact that colonial powers commonly ruled through a local elite, originating mainly from the business sector and decided on policies and programs; the general public therefore depended on the good intentions of this elite for provision of such services (Goodstadt, 2007).\n\n7This article will first examine the areas of health and education in turn, insisting on the contexts in Hong Kong with reference to the colonial legacy and Chinese cultural environment and exploring more recent developments in both areas since the Handover. It will then assess how specific factors (geography, history, politics such as an authoritative form of local government and a special status in China) may have influenced policy. And finally, it will conclude on challenges which lay ahead to measure wellbeing with reference to those sectors in Hong Kong.\n\n2. Health context during the colonial period\n\n10On the Chinese side, some local magnates set up the Tung Wah Hospital in 1869 which provided free medical care and charitable services for the Chinese population of Hong Kong (Sinn, 1989). It is thus wealthy Chinese who were instrumental in addressing some of the early health issues of the Chinese population. In the 1930s, the Tung Wah group of hospitals had developed into the largest charity organization in Hong Kong, running hospitals and schools.\n\n11The Tung Wah Group, the city’s oldest and largest charity organization, originated from the Kwung Fook Temple founded by local Chinese in 1851 (Tung Wah Group of Hospitals website). To help those in need, a hospital using Chinese medicine which had always been widespread among the ethnically Chinese population of Hong Kong was founded on the same spot. However, the popularity of traditional medicine was severely affected by the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s. It remained without any official recognition in the colonial system (Yip et al., 2016) since there were no laws governing practitioners and its knowledge continued to be acquired through apprenticeships (Zanzanaini, 2016).\n\n12It was not until the return of Hong Kong to mainland China in 1997 that the role of traditional Chinese medicine was acknowledged and incorporated as part of the Hong Kong healthcare system (Chung et al., 2007). The Basic Law required the Hong Kong government to regulate Traditional Chinese Medecine and the Chinese Medecine Council of Hong Kong was established in 1999.\n\n13On the British side, several medical facilities were implemented throughout the duration of the colonial period with one of the earliest being the Royal Naval Hospital founded in 1841 and the British Military Hospital built in 1907 for the use of garrisons and their dependents. Civil hospitals were also established in 1849 for troops, convicts, civil servants but only wealthy Chinese were able to pay for established practitioners in Western medicine (Yip et al., 2016: 17; Hutcheon, 1999). Among major hospitals founded during the colonial era, the Queen Elizabeth (1963) once stood out as the largest district general hospital in the Commonwealth.\n\n14Following the end of the Second World War, while in the UK the NHS was established in 1948 on the principle of free healthcare “from cradle to grave”, Hong Kong developed public hospital services for the community to compensate for the low economic capacity of the public to pay for private healthcare services and to curb the recurrence of communicable diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis (Yip et al., 2016). Most public hospitals were thus built in the second half of the 20th century either with the help of charity or government funds to cater to the needs of a population which had more than tripled in the fifteen years which followed the end of the Second World War (Tang, 1998; Census and Statistics Department Website, 2015).\n\n15During the Post-war period, the government became more proactive in disease reduction and control measures as the population grew and the economic situation improved. To maintain a sustained rate of economic growth, the success of disease control became a priority in the mid-1960s. The post-colonial government had in fact inherited the system of the past known for its disease prevention measures. However, throughout the colonial rule, the government continued to place the economy first and rejected the idea of welfare in health policy formulation while maintaining a basic public health service to guarantee social peace and stability by covering all residents’ health needs and thereby ensuring acceptable levels of physical and mental wellbeing.\n\n3. Health policy since the Handover\n\n22The following declaration from the introduction of the Yearbook 2006 of Hong Kong Government outlines the mission of the healthcare system. “The Government aims to ensure no one in Hong Kong is deprived of medical care because of lack of means. It provides a wide range of public services and facilities to meet the healthcare needs of the community. It also works endlessly to safeguard public health – combating infectious diseases and promoting health education.” This definition of a universal public healthcare system is akin to that of the National Health Service NHS in the UK which claims that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery (Grosios et al., 2010) although officially there is a higher emphasis on fighting infectious diseases in Hong Kong.\n\n24According to the 1997 Harvard report, “hospitals are the dominant institutions providing healthcare in Hong Kong and priority is given to hospital-based services”, which constitutes the majority of the healthcare system. There are more than fifty public hospitals and twelve private ones (Lewis, 2008). Healthcare is therefore available for all at nominal charge in government hospitals and clinics (HK$100 (about US$13) for hospital treatment, HK$68 (about US$9) for outpatient treatment Hong Kong’s welfare system) (Wong, 2008: 6). Considering those minimal registration costs, it is clear that the Hong Kong government has basically achieved the goal that every resident can receive lifelong healthcare, and no one will be denied adequate medical treatment due to lack of means (Kong et al., 2015).\n\n25But, in Hong Kong, a continued lack of coordination in the health sector with an excessive reliance on public hospitals which have reached overcapacity adversely affects patients’ health and healthcare and unnecessarily increases the expenditures for health services as family and community medicine is underdeveloped and traditional Chinese medicine, which many chronically ill patients find beneficial, is excluded from the organized medical system. Most traditional Chinese practitioners are in private clinics and some operate in their own clinic. Over 40% of Hong Kong residents rely on Chinese medicine as an alternative option when they have a health problem, whilst 22% of medical consultations are provided by traditional Chinese practitioners (Who/ Department of Health, 2012) who are believed to offer a more holistic approach. Western-style pharmacy chain Watsons has introduced Chinese medicine services in some of its stores to bring traditions within a more modern setting (South China Morning Post, 2014), whilst offering elderly patients a 10% discount on the regular price of treatments. This is how private practice and initiative compensate for the public sector’s inability to fully take into account the patient’s cultural need.\n\n26In the mainstream health field, the public sector is taking care of 90 per cent of the city’s patients, while employing only 40 per cent of the doctors; whereas the lucrative private sector is taking care of only 10 per cent of patients while employing 60 per cent of doctors (South China Morning Post, 2016). The private system, on the other hand, takes on about 70% of all fee-for-service outpatient services compared to public outpatient clinics (Schoebe, 2016: 54).\n\n27Public hospitals, according to the Hospital Authority, currently operate with a shortage of 700 nurses and 250 doctors. New recruits in the profession are routinely lost to the more lucrative and relaxed private sector. It is projected that public hospitals will require an additional 6,200 medical doctor by 2041 in order to maintain the same level of service as today. Among measures to address the current staffing crisis in public hospitals, the Hong Kong government is increasing the number of medical graduates each year: from 250 to 320 last year, and to 420 in 2018 (Schoebe, 2016: 56). Meanwhile, the quality gap between treatments in a private clinic and public ones which have been struggling with large numbers and limited resources has increased over the years (South China Morning Post, 2016). As the superior medical service and treatment mode, private medical institutions are often particularly attractive for patients who have sufficient economic capability (Kong, 2014). The private sector medical care system which was gradually regulated in the 1990s parallels the laissez-faire development of the rest of the economy (Hay, 1995). And the local doctors’ union maintains that “the real issue is the inequitable resource allocation between the private and public sectors, and among different public hospitals” (South China Morning Post, 2016).\n\n28There is therefore some concern that the fragmentation between private and public health systems will accelerate and that only wealthy residents will be able to obtain quality treatment without delay (Schoebe, 2016: 54; Wong, 2008: 10). When needs are not catered for as well as in the past, one might experience stress and frustration, so an alteration of their wellbeing. The Willis Towers Watson 2017-18 Global Benefits Attitudes Survey (the third largest insurance broker in the world health surveys) reported that managing their health is a top priority for two thirds of employees (67%) in Asia and that over half (56%) say that they suffer from elevated levels of stress. As good health is correlated with higher life satisfaction (Department of Health, 2014), one’s health might in turn be altered, confirming that health and wellbeing are clearly interrelated (health influences wellbeing and vice versa). The provision of medical care for the whole population, welfare programs and some labour regulations are policies which make citizens happier. Mental wellbeing can guide people’s behaviour in terms of consumption and investments and at the same time, it improves their life spans (Li et al., 2008: 15).\n\n29Despite the persistent lack of coordination in the health sector, Hong Kong’s healthcare system has often been praised for achieving a better health outcome and being less costly in resources compared to European countries (The Harvard Team, 1999). The health outcome is good, no doubt. In Hong Kong, the ratio of healthcare professionals to the population has increased steadily in the past decade. Every 552 population was served by 1 doctor in 2012, a decrease by 12% compared to 2002 which is in fact an improvement of the situation (Wang, 2013: 1008). According to Healthy Hong Kong, Department of Health, compared with a few decades ago, Hong Kong people nowadays suffer less from infectious diseases (HK Department of Health, 2017). Hong Kong’s 7 million inhabitants are one of the healthiest populations in the world. Life expectancy is 84 for women and 78 for men, the second-highest worldwide (Lewis, 2008). Hong Kong’s Human Development Index (2003) ranked 22nd in the world, respectable among industrial economies, just behind Japan in Asia and on par with Singapore (Wong, 2008: 5).\n\n30Hong Kong's health system was established within the framework of a perfect market-oriented economic matrix, where there are wide ranging social security and medical service systems (Kong et al., 2014). This system of government-operated hospitals, open to all citizens, costs the Hong Kong government about 3% of GDP (6% including private hospitals) which is less than half of the 7.5% of GDP that is already being spent by US governments on healthcare (Lewis, 2008). Within the next two decades, public healthcare expenditure is due to increase up to 23% of the total government budget, a significant increase from its current 14%. Given the Basic Law, which states that, over time, the increase in total government expenditure should be kept in line with growth in GDP, funding for other public programs, such as education, housing and infrastructure, will have to be reduced when public health expenditure takes a larger share of the total budget (The Harvard Team, 1999). This seems to be preparing for an era in which not all aspects of public policy pertaining to individual and societal wellbeing will be covered, especially as demand for healthcare increases. Per capita expenditure on health grew from US$1,289 in 1999-00 to US$1,641 in 2009-10, an increase of 27.4%. The ratio of total expenditure on health to Gross Domestic Product stood at 5.2% in 2009-10 (Wang. 2009: 2).\n\n31Some believe that healthcare must be rationed to patients. The policy of rationing healthcare in Hong Kong amounts to examining which existing medical interventions provided by public hospitals should be subsidised and leaving out those that are not as effective (Yuen et al., 2006). Economists, since Adam Smith, have argued that “the invisible hand of free market prices is a superior rationing system […] to the iron fist of government”, or in other words, that “competitive markets provide the greatest good to the greatest number of people” (Hay, 1992: 65). Colonial authorities have always defended the free market and ultra-liberal system as a model for Hong Kong (Chan, 1996: 14). However economic freedom and legal rights have not always been protected and laissez-faire might have instead been an excuse for the government of Hong Kong to avoid any responsibility towards its people. It was only after the 1967 riots that the Hong Kong government began to adopt a more responsive social policy through social legislation and provision of social services such as labour law, welfare programs, and mass education entitlement (Chan, 1996:15). Besides Hong Kong is far from a free market as official patronage and special preferences have always dominated in key personnel appointments and major decision-making process, concerning public works contracts, real estate, monetary and financial measures (BBC News, Hong Kong, 2012).\n\n32During the mainland immigration flows of the 1930s, the need for public housing was already acknowledged by the government. Since 2006, private ownership has been going up slowly from 49% whereas public rental and subsidised sectors have gone down from 48.8%. As of the 2016 Population By-census, 45% of the population lived in public rental housing or subsidised home ownership housing compared to 53% in the private permanent housing. This shows that authorities have not just relied on market allocation but have instead controlled some key institutions which are essential to people’s wellbeing.\n\n33Healthcare like housing appears crucial to survival and to maintaining decent standards of quality of life. But it is less easy to obtain through a free capitalist market than thorough public administration. As healthcare is vital for one to remain in good physical and mental condition, some economists understandably argue otherwise that its quality and availability must be guaranteed by the government (Hay, 1995).\n\n4. Challenges ahead for the wellbeing of an ageing population\n\n34According to the Asian Urban Wellbeing Indicators Comparative Report, Hong Kong has assigned a high level of priority to medical care (Civic Exchange, 2016). Hong Kong has to face up to the ageing of its population but unlike developed countries, its population is confined to a very small territory. Crowded urban lodging increases the sanitary risk as the elderly form a vulnerable part of the population. Due to its unique geopolitical location, Hong Kong remains constantly on the lookout for new emerging diseases. Besides, wealthy families are still able to rely on paid labour to care for their seniors but that is not the case for the majority of the population.\n\n35It is predicted that the elderly population (aged 65 and above) will double to over 2 million by 2029. The elderly tend to visit medical facilities more often (in fact, 4.7 times more often) than younger patients, and they make up 42% of all inpatients in public hospitals (Localizz, 2017).\n\n36Satisfaction with medical care in Hong Kong is currently high: among those selecting this domain, 56% were satisfied with how fast and easy it is to see a doctor; 64% were satisfied with the availability of affordable care; and 74% were satisfied with the quality of care they received. But inevitably as the population ages, medical care will rise as a priority for Hong Kong residents, and the government will find it more difficult to maintain current levels of satisfaction (Civic Exchange, 2016).\n\n37As a result, healthcare for elderly people and their conditions such as dementia in primary care or in a community setting has become important priorities like in most developed countries. In 2014, Professor Lord Darzi, who led a delegation of UK companies to the Hospital Authority Convention in Hong Kong, concluded that they shared many similar healthcare challenges particularly that of a larger and ageing population and the increasing importance of improving primary care to reduce reliance on hospital care. According to him, the redesign of buildings and services to tackle this is simultaneously happening in Hong Kong and the UK and both could cooperate in sharing experience as they adjust to meet the challenges which lay ahead (Foreign and Commonwealth Office, 2014). On 15 October 2015, the UK and Hong Kong signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a period of five years on health co-operation, including healthcare policy and protection, technology and redevelopment of existing hospital facilities (Foreign and Commonwealth Office, 2015).\n\n38Some pilot schemes like cross-residential bounder care projects have been backed by charitable organizations in Hong Kong. Care homes on the Chinese mainland border where space is more readily accessible, the environment of better quality and costs of living generally lower once appeared as the solution for ordinary people. But this no longer seems to be a desirable option since the yuan appreciated against the Hong Kong dollar thereby rising living expenses and the new generation of elderly born in Hong Kong are less keen to move up north to the mainland where they have no connections (China Daily, 2017).\n\n39Handling healthcare challenges and assessing levels of satisfaction in the field remain as relevant as it is for education which will be developed in the next part.\n\n5. Educational context during the colonial period\n\n40There were initially twenty Chinese village schools in the 1860s but wealthy Chinese preferred to send their children to Canton for private education (Tang, 2006: 8). In 1862, the first government school, Queen's College (then Government Central School) was set up and based itself upon voluntary and philanthropic work. Educational initiatives tended to have a unique Chinese and British influence because of the region’s proximity to China and its position as a British colony, although a western education style including Christian beliefs remained key features.\n\n41By the turn of the 20th century, Hong Kong families had started to value the British education system as trade levels increased in the colony and the number of wealthy Chinese grew with more opportunities and influential networks outside. Besides, as a cosmopolitan city, it attracted diverse nationalities and remained a window to the outside world. British-style education proved to better prepare students for higher education, professional training, or further study abroad, all prerequisites to form part of the new westernized and modern elite. English was thus regarded as part of elite culture and gave access to a good career in government, education, academia and law and this is still true today (Cheng, 2014).\n\n42In addition, government funding was only offered to British and Chinese schools being administered through western models and not to the traditional Chinese institutions with a curriculum often based on teaching ancient texts of little relevance to the modern world. Hong Kong’s first university was founded in 1912 as an English-medium tertiary institution. The university supported the community by enabling those involved in education studies to combine their coursework with teaching experiences in the local communities, thereby raising educational standards for those previously devoid of such an opportunity and as a consequence, increase the attractiveness of the residential area in the vicinity (Martinez, 2013).\n\n43In the 1960s, government spending on schools was not seen as a priority. Government officials became increasingly committed to education in general, and as an investment in the workforce of the future and its productivity, most noticeably in the 1970s due to demographic changes in the population (Government Secretariat, Hong Kong, 1981). With a young and rapidly increasing population, it became clear that a massive school building program was needed and that the main priority was the development of primary education and teacher training. Nine years of free and compulsory schooling was thus adopted for all pupils in 1978 (extended to 12 years of subsidized education in 2008-2009) (Wong, 2008: 6). Another policy was the establishment of engineering, science, and business evening classes for students as well as evening training for teachers.\n\n44By contrast, two decades later, Hong Kong had developed from a manufacturing country in the 1970s and 1980s and evolved into a regional hub of business and service in the 1990s, thus witnessing a decline in employment opportunities in the secondary sector and a growth in the tertiary. Education then expanded as part of a government effort to develop Hong Kong into a knowledge-based economy and enrolments in higher education tripled from 1989 (Wu, 2010: 5-6). According to Wu, the young post-80s generation is the major beneficiary of the education expansion in the 1990s, and they have enjoyed more educational opportunities than those of the same age groups in earlier years. However young people remain frustrated in terms of opportunities and hopes for the future as the pro-democracy “Umbrella” protests showed in 2014 (Wu, 2010: i-ii).\n\n6. Education policy after the Handover\n\n45Since the post-colonial period, changing the medium of instruction in secondary schools has been one of the most controversial policies in Hong Kong’s education. Prior to the 1970s, English was still the only official language and it remains highly regarded today as an international language (Tang, 2006: 2). Most local schools used English for teaching different subjects although some classes were taught in Cantonese. Mandarin which is considered as standard Chinese started being introduced in schools as early as the 1980s but it was not until 1998 that it became an essential part of the local curriculum (Liu, 2017). Indeed, in April 1997, three months before the Handover, the new government published a document regarding compulsory Chinese medium instruction policy. It suggested that enhanced fluency in Mandarin would help students whose mother tongue is Cantonese and who use full-form characters instead of the simplified version widespread on Mainland China understand content better. However, in September 2007, the government retreated to give more freedom to schools to be exempt from this policy. As a result, only 25% of the secondary schools were approved to continue EMI (English as a Medium of Instruction) education, whereas the rest of the secondary schools must use CMI (Chinese as a Medium of Instruction) in teaching most subjects (Cheng, 2014). Furthermore, the new language policy required teachers to enhance their language proficiency. Thus, there was the emergence of Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers in 2008 to mainly assess the Mandarin and English skills both of which are not mother tongues in Hong Kong, a Cantonese stronghold (Cheng, 2014).\n\n46In 2012, another drastic reform was the application of the Chinese educational system, which follows the American model of “three-three-four” (middle school/ high school/ tertiary education) thereby extending university education from three to four years. This has affected all levels of local students and educators. Students end up having only one public examination, the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE). Another particularly controversial area was the introduction of civic education in 2012, perceived as a political step which caused a series of radical protests initiated by political parties and youth. Changing language policy in education was only the first wave of reforms that the Hong Kong government has recently initiated to gradually decrease British influence. The reactions of parents, students and teachers were very strong, reflecting not only how attached they are to English as a medium of instruction, but also how entrenched British educational values adopted during the colonial period remain today (Cheng, 2014).\n\n48More resources have been allocated to education. The total government expenditure on education amounted to US$10,031 million in 2012-13, an increase of 40.7% compared to US$7,128 million in 2002-03 (Wang, 2013: 1008). For 2017-18, the total government expenditure on education is estimated at US$11 million. The recurrent education spending is about 21.3% of the overall government spending (Lee, 2017). In 2015-16, about 3.3% of GDP was spent on education. This is, however, lower than other high-income economies and well beneath the OECD average of 5.9% a year (OECD, 2014). Furthermore, education in Hong Kong was largely modelled on that of the United Kingdom and is overseen by the Education Bureau and the Social Welfare Department which outlines the administration policies of government and aided schools. University education is subsidized for some 20% of relevant age cohorts (Wong, 2008: 6).\n\n49Education remains one of the most important public policy areas for the new leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, whose five-year term of Chief Executive began on 1 July 2017. She had promised in her election manifesto to increase financial resources to the education sector (Lee, 2017). In early July 2017, she announced in her first question-and-answer session in the Legislative Council that the government would be spending an extra HK$3.6 billion (US$450 million) for local undergraduate programs, to increase the ratio of classes to teachers in public primary and secondary schools with the creation of 3,200 permanent teacher posts within a year (2017-2018). Lam’s education policy direction is largely agreed to by different stakeholders in the education sector (Lee, 2017) and is part of a policy to transform Hong Kong into a regional education hub for higher education (Lee, 2014).\n\n50The outcome of these post-Handover education policies is that among population aged 15 and above, the proportion of those having attained secondary and post-secondary levels increased from 71.1% in 2001 to 77.3% in 2011. There has been a continued improvement in the quality of education in terms of pupil-teacher ratios. For primary level, it improved considerably from 19.8 in the 2002-03 school year to 13.9 in the 2012-13 school year; while that for secondary level also improved from 17.6 to 13.7 over the same period (Wang, 2013: 1008). Though pupils over 15 in Hong Kong perform very well in terms of mathematics and reading, student wellbeing (life satisfaction and sense of belonging at school) remains well beneath OECD average whereas schoolwork-related anxiety is higher than average (OECD a), 2017). Policies aimed at encouraging higher education should not only target the young, but also enhance positive valuation of education throughout one’s life. Awareness campaigns promoting the benefits of education, including practical or vocational skills, can help better promote the intrinsic value of education at all levels (ESRC, 2014).\n\n51Higher levels of education are associated with a wide range of positive outcomes - including better health and wellbeing, higher social trust, greater political interest, lower political cynicism, and less hostile attitudes towards immigrants (ESRC, 2014). Yet the emphasis on education today affects people with lower levels of education who may suffer from low self-esteem and as a consequence enjoy less personal wellbeing (ESRC, 2014).\n\n52Hong Kong has been the heir to the social welfare and educational traditions from her colonial past (missionary and charity works) as well as Confucian values of self-reliance and family duty. The integration of the two legacies produced a special mix of welfare values and educational practices from east and west. The legacy of a highly centralized and executive-led governance regime continues in Hong Kong today where there is little public input over education. In terms of education, the Chinese population in Hong Kong has always adopted a practical attitude in order to guarantee the success of its youth. Faith schools which enabled the best schooling in English were favoured over others because they either helped achieve a professional career in Hong Kong or enabled them to pursue higher education abroad in English-speaking countries. Parents continue to view schools as a path to upward social mobility (Postiglione et al., 1998: preface) especially since under the British colonial framework and up until the signing of the Sino-British declaration in 1984, the schools of Hong Kong have catered to the elite (Postiglione, 1992: introduction).\n\n7. Wellbeing, health and education in Hong Kong\n\n53Education has become one of the clearest indicators of life outcomes such as employment, income and social status, and is a strong predictor of attitudes and wellbeing. Education is often used by people to shape their ‘social identity’, sketching out their understanding of themselves and their relationships with other people. A positive, affirming social identity is associated with a range of positive outcomes in life, such as increased wellbeing, health, social trust and political engagement (ESRC, 2014).\n\n56Hong Kong has developed a unique social and economic model which has contributed to its economic success and is highly regarded in the world. Its position has been confirmed over time by one of the highest HDI among developed countries (Hong Kong ranked 7th in the 2018 UN Human Development Indicator, before the US and Great Britain). The efficiency of its administration, an extremely well-developed transport and communication network, sound education, health and public housing infrastructure, all contribute to this ranking. Besides English as a business and education language, together with Cantonese and Mandarin as official languages are assets on the world stage.\n\n57During the colonial period, while the British preferred to let the Chinese community solve their own problems without interfering in social policy (Goodstadt, 2007: 23), neither the colonial authorities nor the business sector, which supported them, had understood that economic growth would not be sufficient to solve Hong Kong’s social, political and environmental problems. Until very recently, the contrast between a thriving society and institutions, which were incompletely developed, remained stark. For instance, healthcare was fragmented until the creation of a Hospital Authority in 1990 with Chinese clinics being the most widespread offer for the local population until the 1960s (Goodstadt, 2007: 24). Health had been left at the mercy of citizens but with an ageing population (about 27% will reach the age of 65 by 2030), families who mostly lack time, space and finances to provide adequate care for their elder relatives have seen their burden increase. Another illustration of Hong Kong’s lagging behind other developed countries is that the workforce was not entitled to a statutory retirement pension scheme until December 2000 (Information Services Department, Hong Kong, 2015).\n\n61These findings seem to confirm the feeling that there is a growing disappointment from a Cantonese-speaking youth which has lost hope in a political and social system which no longer matches expectations. They feel stranded in between their family’s local expectations and social pressure for them to play a greater role in the People’s Republic of China's society (Ford, 1996: 80).\n\n62The conflict between the desire to have government ensured healthcare and education for all and the recognition that private markets provide goods and services more effectively than the government is nothing new (Hay, 1995). Veenhoven believes that the amount and extent of welfare are negotiable but he insists that it should not be written off altogether. Whilst they do not necessarily help much in producing more or less wellbeing, welfare systems nevertheless provide a neutral framework in which to develop wellbeing (Veenhoven, 2000).\n\n63The Happiness Index used for the Youth Quality of Life Report also demonstrates that many young people are unhappy with their lives as compared to previous years. But it does not help the government clearly identify the actual causes behind fluctuations in wellbeing which would also enable it to adopt more suitable policies. This report assesses a state without enquiring about the aspects of government performance that are creating dissatisfaction and trying to establish a connection between the deteriorating wellbeing of Hong Kong people to tensions with Mainland China and the Occupy Movement (Social and Economic Mobility, 2015).\n\n65In 2011, the OECD launched the Better Life Initiative, which aimed to measure wellbeing by looking at material conditions and quality of life through eleven dimensions ranging from income and health to work-life balance, civic engagement, and subjective wellbeing. The initiative was itself inspired by the Stiglitz 2009 Report following the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, which was created to identify the limits of GDP as an indicator of economic performance and social progress. It is likely that Hong Kong will follow the UK and Canada’s lead and find inspiration in the Better Life Initiative to formulate wellbeing indices (Social and Economic Mobility, 2015).\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n66After over a century of colonial rule and twenty years under a special status within China, Hong Kong has reached a state of economic development which makes it one of the most advanced places in terms of health and education. However, the population has mostly benefited from its newly-found wealth through the top down directives to improve overall wellbeing without any direct public consultation on citizens’ life expectations. Moreover, Hong Kong’s short-term future could be greatly affected by two main challenges: the Chinese government’s growing tendency to interpret and rely on the Basic Law to reaffirm full control over the most Southern part of its territory inhabited by a Cantonese-speaking population which has partly lost trust in their local political institutions and an ageing population with limited land resources. This demographic evolution is common to all Western and Asian economically advanced nations but Hong Kong will be particularly affected by old age and dependency due to its tight manoeuvring space, and it could thus develop as a platform to experiment with new ideas and concepts regarding forms of social organisations like cross-border care on the mainland.\n\n67Recently Hong Kong has adopted international criteria to assess wellbeing. Yet some questions remain as to how to use the wellbeing assessments, which overall reflect favourably on the government as Hong Kong’s GDP per capita ranks seventh based on purchasing power parity rates (Social and Economic Mobility, 2015). The Hong Kong Quality of Life Index asks participants to report stress levels and life satisfaction but it does not necessarily establish a causal connection. The Happiness Index used for the Youth Quality of Life Report also fails to guide policy makers on how to improve the lives of citizens as it does provide in-depth insight but only speculates over some of the possible causes affecting levels of wellbeing (Social and Economic Mobility, 2015).\n\n68Surveying institutions “should ask more in-depth questions when assessing subjective social indicators” in order to uncover not only how but also “why respondents feel more content or less content with their lives as compared to previous years” (Social and Economic Mobility, 2015). The Hong Kong government is currently proposing to implement a family impact assessment in any policy formulation. This latest improvement in the wellbeing index could be used to measure the government’s performance in some domains (Elliot et al., 2016).\n\n69In measuring the wellbeing fluctuations of a population, political aspects should also be explored on top of economic and social components and included in any assessment of health and education. The study case of Hong Kong with its unique geopolitical setting and top down approach to policy-making may be as interesting for China as it is for economically advanced nations."
