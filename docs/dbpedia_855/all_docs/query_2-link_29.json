        "text": "Cookies processed directly by VBC will not be disseminated, nor will they be transferred outside the European Union.\n\nThird-party cookies that are transferred abroad (United States) are those relating to YouTube. You can decide whether or not to consent to the data transfer. We urge users belonging to the European Economic Area and/or subject to the GDPR to be particularly careful before using YouTube as we believe that there may be several limitations to the rights normally recognised in Europe.\n\nCurrently, there is no adequate level of protection for data sent to the US under European law, even though the “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” has already been announced with the European Commission. There is therefore a risk that your data, depending on whether the services that you use in order to use this site relating to the use of the YouTube service to view videos made available on our site, may be subject to access by US authorities for control and monitoring purposes and that you may not have effective legal remedies against such processing. By clicking on “Accept Cookies”, you agree that cookies may be used on our website by us and by this third-party provider (also in the USA).\n\nWith the exception of YouTube, transfers of data abroad by VBC may be based on an adequacy decision or on the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.\n\nYou will find the details of the information relating to each cookie including storage times in this statement.\n\nIn any case, you can make changes to the settings by disabling or deleting the individual categories of cookie by accessing the “Show details” item on the banner and/or on the section dedicated to cookies by clicking here.\n\nFor Chinese users browsing this site, the European General Data Protection Regulation applies in addition to that related to their browsing experience outlined in the Chinese privacy policy available here.\n\nThe cookies that Vitale Barberis Canonico S.p.A. processes through its sites have three purposes applicable to all the Vitale Barberis Canonico S.p.A. sites summarised above:\n\nrelating to the execution of measures related to contractual or pre-contractual obligations: technical and functional access to the site and navigation that allows the user to customize his/her choice (e.g. selected fabric or tailor closest to the place he/she indicated). These purposes correspond to technical cookies;\n\nrelating to user browsing analysis that makes it possible to collect useful statistics for improving the service (through the Matomo Analytics service) and subject to the user’s consent. These purposes correspond to the analysis cookies;\n\nrelating to the best use of the service requested by the user if he/she wishes to view a YouTube (third party) video present on our sites and with the user’s consent. These purposes correspond to profiling cookies.\n\nThe provision of the above data is optional with regard to analysis and profiling cookies. In the first case, Vitale Barberis Canonico S.p.A. could not improve its services because it would not be able to access statistical information relating to the user’s browsing. In the second case, the user will not be able to view the video from YouTube.\n\nThe processing of such data will take place with electronic tools with the use of software systems and will be communicated within the competent company areas and to the designated Data Processors."
