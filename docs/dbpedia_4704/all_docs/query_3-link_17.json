        "text": "Looking for a fun thing to do in San Diego other than visiting Sea World, the San Diego Zoo, craft beer breweries, or going to Comic Con? K1 Speed San Diego provides a thrill like no other in town! Located in beautiful downtown San Diego, near the Gaslamp Quarter, East Village, and Petco Park, K1 Speed San Diego provides exciting racing action in an incredibly convenient location. Our K1 Speed San Diego location brings indoor go-kart racing to the heart of America’s Finest City! We invite you to come down today – it’s the same thrilling experience, much closer to home.\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Southern California!\n\nWe have a number of different ways to experience indoor go-kart racing at our San Diego location. By far our most popular is our Arrive & Drive option. With this package, individuals of all ages* can come in anytime and experience the thrill of indoor karting, without the need to schedule a reservation. Simply show up and start racing – it’s that easy! Our Arrive & Drive races are for best lap time, allowing individuals to race for the win regardless of where they slot in the starting order, providing for a fair and evenly matched playing field.\n\nFor groups of 8 or more people, we also offer a range of go-kart racing packages. These packages are great for groups, as they provide exclusive use of the track during your heats, reserved race times, and even a podium celebration for the winners! Perhaps best of all, our race packages are structured after a Formula One or FIA GT race weekend – rather than race against the clock, you race against each other for position! Whoever passes the checkered flag first wins!\n\nIf you’ve visited our K1 Speed Carlsbad location, then you know just how impressive our all-electric karts are. However, if you’ve never made the trek up north, or are new to the sport of indoor go-kart racing, you’re in for a surprise! The karts at our San Diego location features 20hp electric motors, providing them with superior performance to gas-powered alternatives. Around our roughly one-quarter-mile indoor kart track, they can reach speeds approaching 45mph! You can rest assured, whether you drive a Porsche every day or a bicycle, you will not be disappointed in the performance!\n\nWe have developed our San Diego indoor go-kart racing location with your needs in mind. If you and your friends are coming in on a Friday night or Sunday afternoon to take part in our Arrive & Drive program, you’ll find a spacious lounge, complete with black leather couches, plasma televisions, our Paddock Lounge eatery, and a collection of authentic racing memorabilia. We want you to feel like K1 Speed is the place to go to for karting!\n\nIf you are planning a party for multiple people, you will find a variety of private room rentals available, of varying sizes, as well as an extensive list of catering options. Your satisfaction is important to us at K1 Speed, and we have done everything possible to accommodate your needs and those of your party. If you are planning a large gathering, we are confident you won’t find a better option than our San Diego karting location! Experience indoor go-kart racing today! This location is in downtown San Diego, near the Gaslamp Quarter and East Village."
