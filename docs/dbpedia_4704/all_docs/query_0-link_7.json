        "text": "Height Requirements & What to Wear\n\nCheck Your Heights!\n\nWe do not have any age restrictions at K1 Speed, but we do have height requirements. To drive our junior karts, you must be a kid that’s at least 48″ (4′) or taller. For our adult karts, you’ll need to be at least 58″ (4’10”).\n\nNow, this is important: meeting the height requirement is not a guarantee you’ll be able to race our karts. Drivers will be measured at the location and must be able to safely operate all elements of the kart. Final approval will be at management’s discretion.\n\nThis is because sometimes your height is more in your torso, rather than your legs. So while you may be tall enough, your legs might not be LONG enough to reach the pedals. We need to make sure you can fully use the kart (depress the pedals down all the way, reach the steering wheel comfortably, etc.) before we let you race. This is all in the name of safety, mind you!\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nAnother thing you’ll want to know before you go is what to wear for go kart racing. We require that all racers wear closed-toe shoes, keep long hair tied back, and don’t wear anything too loose fitting. T-shirts, jeans/shorts and sneakers are appropriate attire for a day of go kart racing at the track. Keep in mind, indoor kart racing at K1 Speed is a very physical activity so dress accordingly!\n\nRead More: Check Out Our Merch!\n\nWhen you enter the building, head directly to the computers that you’ll see set up by the cashier. If this is your first visit, this is where you will register an account with K1 Speed. If you decide to opt into our emails (you really should), be sure your email address is correct. Our emails inform you about special events and deals throughout the year!\n\nIf you’ve already got an account with us, simply check in on the computer so that our cashiers can pull you up easily.\n\nIf this is your first visit to K1 Speed, you’ll be given a safety briefing prior to getting in to your go kart. If you’re a repeat customer, you’ll proceed to our helmets.\n\nOur safety briefing goes over all the rules of the track, how to operate the go kart, and what the various flags mean. Listen carefully to ensure you and the rest of your group have a trouble-free session without any unexpected speed penalties.\n\nYou’ll then pick your helmet. Our helmets vary by size, and are color-coded smaller to larger. Small is pink, medium is red, large is blue, and extra large is black. You’ll want a helmet that fits snug, but not too tight. Helmets that are too small will be difficult to get on and will feel like it’s crushing your head. Helmets too large will be too easy to put on and will feel loose around your head. Find that sweet spot that gives a little resistance when putting it on and feels comfortable while wearing.\n\nRead More: Why Go Kart Racing is Safer at K1 Speed >>\n\nFor additional comfort before indoor kart racing, leave your visor open. If you need help with the chin strap, let one of our staff know and they’ll be happy to assist.\n\nAfter you’ve got the helmet on, head over to the track worker by the computer in pit lane. He’ll tell you the number of the go kart you’re assigned to. Proceed to the go kart with that number.\n\nEnter the go kart and fasten your seat belts. Once seated, our track staff will turn on each kart, and assist you if you need additional help settling in. When instructed, close your helmet’s visor by sliding it down.\n\nKarts will enter the track single-file. For the first lap, you’ll find your go kart is not at its peak speed. Use this time to warm up your tires by safely swerving your kart to the left and right – just like the pros. Warming up your tires is crucial if you want your go kart to grip the track surface right away.\n\nWhen our track marshal waves the green flag, your race has begun, and you’ll be at the appropriate speed level. The race lasts until the fastest racer completes 12 laps around the track.\n\nNOTE: Our Arrive & Drive races are for fastest lap – not overall position on the track. Therefore, you will be ranked by lap time, rather than track position. If you’re interested in races for position at K1 Speed, look into our racing leagues or come out for Grid Night!\n\nNOTES ABOUT SPEED SETTINGS:\n\nOur electric go karts are not like the ones you’re used to at a family fun center. They are MUCH faster. Because of this speed, our go karts have several speed settings that are controlled by our staff. All first-time K1 Speed racers will be on the second-to-highest speed setting. This allows our staff to monitor your performance at that current speed without taking risks and throwing you into the deep end.\n\nThis is all in the name of safety, as we’d hate for you to injure yourself or another racer. Once our staff sees that you’re able to handle the current speed setting, your kart will be boosted to the highest speed setting. This may take a race or two of clean racing.\n\nAs long as you don’t do any of the above for a race or two, your speed should be at the highest setting. That said, there can be exceptions (for example, if it’s a busier track with lots of incidents, we may decrease the speed on everyone’s kart for safety reasons).\n\nIMPORTANT: Our races award the racer with the fastest lap NOT the first one to see the checkered flag. So if you find yourself stuck behind a slower driver and they’re not obeying the blue flag, then slow down and give yourself a gap. Then try to set a fast lap without any traffic in front of you. For more tips about how to win at K1 Speed, read our blog post by clicking the button below.\n\nEvery location has a giant screen with a real-time reading of everyone’s lap times in order. It’s important to quickly look at this screen when racing by. It’ll tell you what position you’re currently in, what your fastest lap time is so far, and the lap time you set on your previous lap.\n\nUse this screen to try different racing lines and braking points and see how it affects your times. This will allow you to discover what’s faster and what’s slower around the track so you can improve.\n\nWhen the checkered flag waves, return to pit lane and remain seated. Staff will let you know when it is safe for you to leave your kart.\n\nAfter you’ve left your kart and returned your helmet, proceed to the Pit Café or Paddock Lounge. A staff member will have a personalized scoresheet available for each racer in your heat.\n\nThis scoresheet includes the final results of your race. You’ll see each driver’s best lap time in order from fastest to slowest. You’ll also see everyone’s average lap time. In addition, you’ll see the time you set for each lap. Study this closely. It’ll clue you in on when you set your fastest lap, so you can think back to what you were doing when that occurred. An ideal graph will curve down and get lower and lower.\n\nUnless your group is ultra-competitive, ask the other racers how they were approaching different parts of the track. If that friend was faster than you, or quicker in a particular section, ask what they were doing and apply it during your next race."
