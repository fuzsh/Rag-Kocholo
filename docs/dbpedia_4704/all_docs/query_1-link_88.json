        "text": "Kyle recently visited Anaheim in May of this year, so he took the opportunity go back to K1 Speed after his interest in Karting started there over 4 years ago as a Junior League driver. This time around, he posted 4 first place finishes in 5 races. The other was a second place finish with just 0.119 seconds separating him and the leader.\n\nK1 does a nice job of keeping all of their driver race history online, so I can embed it here. In those results, you can also see his Junior League stats – the rows listed from 2010, and even click through to each of the individual races.\n\nK1 SPEED - Anaheim"
