        "text": "We’re excited to announce that we now have a second go kart racing location in LA County location – K1 Speed Burbank!\n\nPreviously, Angelenos searching for the best racing experience had only one option – our amazing K1 Speed Torrance. But now that K1 Speed Burbank is open, we have TWO locations in the Greater LA Metro-Area! We’re now more accessible to residents in the area than ever before.\n\nGiven our close proximity to the movie and television industry, our new Burbank center provides an exciting new location for video shoots to all the local studios. We’ve already been a part of ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, Nickelodeon’s JoJo Siwa, and Flo Rida’s music video for the hit single “Let It Roll”, plus many more. We can’t wait to see what’ll be filmed now that we’re neighbors with some of the largest studios in the business. If you work in the industry, consider this your invite *wink* *wink*.\n\nRead More: Why K1 Speed is An Exciting & Unique Venue for Your Next Film Shoot\n\nOf course, our signature attraction at K1 Speed Burbank is our indoor go kart racing experience! As you know, our electric karts are faster than gas-powered go karts and much better for both the environment and guests thanks to their zero emissions.\n\nKids can enjoy the exciting speeds of our Junior Karts, while older drivers can get an adrenaline rush in our Adult karts that approach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour – the fastest in the industry.\n\nThe indoor track is professionally designed to promote overtaking opportunities and presents a challenge to both amateurs and veteran racers alike. Lining the track are Protex karting barriers – the latest and safest barrier system on the market today. These barriers are illuminated with bright and colorful LED lights that transform the traditional go kart racing experience into something new and exciting.\n\nK1 Speed Burbank is not just a go kart racing track, but an indoor entertainment center for the whole family. In addition to racing, there’s more fun to be had off-track in our new game room! We’ve got the latest video games and prize machines, pool tables, basketball hoops, and air hockey! This room is fun for all ages!\n\nFor over two decades, we’ve been famous for our enormously fun parties and events – from small birthday parties to massive company parties. As such, K1 Speed Burbank has two private event rooms available for rent: the F1 Room and the MotoGP Room. To complete events, both casual and full-service catering options are available."
