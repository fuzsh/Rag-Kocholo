(ID required) – a $24+ Value!\n\nFREE use of our helmets\n\nOne FREE reusable headsock (additional headsocks available for purchase)\n\n10% off apparel & accessories (excludes K1 RaceGear and sale items)\n\nAccess to your racing score online\n\nStoring of your racing history in our database\n\nEmails with special offers\n\nHow Much Does the K1 Speed Annual License Cost?\n\nThe cost of a K1 Speed Annual License is only $7.95 and you get all of the above!
