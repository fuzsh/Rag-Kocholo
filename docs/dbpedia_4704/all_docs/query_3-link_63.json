As a result, many events (and finals) will take place in the morning U.S. time. NBC will air two daily Olympics shows, one that coincides with Paris’ prime time (from 2:00 p.m. ET through 5:00 p.m. ET) and another in traditional U.S. prime time, which will show highlights. You can also watch live on Peacock.\n\nHow can I watch the 2024 Olympics for free?\n\nYou won’t be able to watch every event, but NBC’s broadcast channel is the heart of the network’s coverage. The best way to watch that for free on a big screen is with a good HD antenna. Be sure to test the antenna in multiple locations in your home to find the most reliable signal.\n\nHow can I stream the 2024 Paris Olympics live online if I don’t have a cable subscription?\n\nPeacock is the streaming home of the 2024 Summer Games, carrying every event live and on demand as well as offering a daily recap for viewers. Peacock also has a fully interactive Olympics experience, letting you decide how you build your own schedule of events and catch key highlights, as well as a Multiview functionality that will let you watch up to four sports simultaneously.\n\nDon’t have a subscription? There are several other streaming options to choose from – some free, some with free trial periods and some requiring a log-in from your cable or satellite provider.\n\nNBC has set up the NBCOlympics.com website and offers the NBCSports app with the widest variety of options. Otherwise, try one of these:\n\nDisney+\n\nDisney’s bundle of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ no longer has a free trial, so you’ll have to pay $15 per month for all three combined (or $25 per month for no ads on Hulu).\n\nIncluding Live TV in the bundle bumps the price to $77 per month ($90 with no ads).\n\nHulu with Live TV\n\nThe free trial on this service is no longer offered, as well. It will now cost you $77 per month.\n\nYouTubeTV\n\nAfter up to a two-week trial, you can expect monthly charges of $73.\n\nSling TV\n\nDish Network’s Sling lower-tiered “Orange” plan will run you $40 per month. Adding the more comprehensive “Blue” plan bumps the cost to $55 per month. The seven-day free trial has disappeared, unfortunately.\n\nDirecTV Stream\n\nFormerly known as DirecTV Now, AT&T TVNow and AT&T TV, this oft-renamed streaming service will run you $75 per month and up after the free trial option.\n\nFubo TV"
