        "text": "Major investments are being made in the future of American motor sports.\n\nVerlinvest, an international, family-backed evergreen investment firm, is emerging as one of the leaders in investing in racing’s future. With recent investments in K1 Speed, Verlinvest is now positioned to accelerate the growth of electric kart racing as an affordable way for young racers to get involved.\n\n“In recent years, the motorsport market has grown immensely, and at the same time, we’ve seen new generations of consumers (i.e., millennials) focusing more on experiences such as sport, wellness, travel, live entertainment, fitness, and kids’ activities, rather than physical goods, when spending their time and money,” Clement Pointillart, managing director of Verlinvest, said. “K1 Speed has been at the forefront of these trends and is building a platform and a brand that consumers love.\n\n“U.S. karting is an attractive market, and David [Danglard], Susan [Danglard] and their team have built a great business over the last 20 years, providing consumers with a quality experience and sustainability at its core. As a family- backed investment company, with a long-term and global outlook, we at Verlinvest share their values and have decades of relevant experience in building internationally loved brands, so believe this will be a fruitful partnership.”\n\nKarting is seen as one of the first steps for young racers to develop the skills needed to become a professional years down the road. It’s known as the key form of racing for beginners, many of whom end up competing in Nascar, the NTT IndyCar Series, Formula 1 among many more divisions.\n\nThe American karting industry is larger than many consumers realize. Verlinvest said that U.S. karting is valued at over $1.3 billion and is projected to grow 5 to 6% through 2027.\n\nBy the end of 2024, K1 Speed plans to expand to over 100 locations, largely due to Verlinvest’s investment.\n\nK1 Speed’s executive leadership plans to capitalize on Formula One’s growing popularity by accelerating their expansion efforts in 2024 to provide more consumers with first-hand access to the thrill of European-style racing. The brand recently signed new leases for future centers in prominent domestic and international markets. The company is also opening its industry-defining outdoor racing circuit in early 2024 and finalizing plans to break ground on a pair of flagship locations in the United Kingdom and New York metropolitan area.\n\n“Netflix’s NFLX ‘Drive to Survive’ introduced Formula One racing to the U.S. and has helped to increase awareness of karting, where most F1 drivers began their careers,” David Danglard, CEO and president of K1 Speed, said. “The program broadcasted the sport in a way that has become appealing to younger race fans and since then, has been instrumental to the growing interest in racing and karting more broadly.”\n\nThe investment is highlighted by K1 Circuit, the outdoor circuit that will take the green flag this year in Winchester, California.\n\n“There’s a ton of potential and we plan to expand K1’s platform by leveraging the founding vision and ability to innovate, while building its substantial asset base into a global experience destination,” Pointillart said.\n\nThink of this type of investment as parallel to Josh Harris and David Blitzer investing in youth baseball. In order to secure the future of the sport, investments need to be made to assist the next generation of athletes.\n\nHarris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, the firm made an investment in Joe Gibbs Racing last year. As minority owners in Toyota’s largest and most successful Nascar team in history, they are helping majority owner Joe Gibbs, who coached the Washington Commanders to three Super Bowl triumphs, create a direction for the team’s future.\n\nLikewise with Nascar’s Trackhouse Racing, co-owned by Justin Marks and well-known entertainer Pitbull. Trackhouse Entertainment Group announced in late December that it is now in the private equity market in an attempt to raise capital to expand outside of Nascar.\n\n“If we think about the future for Trackhouse, it looks like we’re going to raise investment capital to have our powder dry so we’re able to take advantage of really unique and lucrative opportunities ahead of us, and there are many of them,” Marks told Sports Business Journal’s Adam Stern in December 2023. “I think really the next step is making sure we get that partner to really take advantage of that opportunity and scale the brand into a very valuable platform.” The timeline for a deal was unclear.”\n\nFor Verlinvest, the firm believes it is deepening its knowledge in the lifestyle category.\n\n“We’ve been looking for companies like K1 Speed, which has similar DNA to Verlinvest in terms of a long- term, global outlook, driven by family values and focused on consumers in everything they do,” Pointillart said. “We have also recently made investments in other sports and outdoor businesses like Pedego (e-bikes), so we are deepening our knowledge and experience in this category.”\n\nAs investments continue to be made in the future of motor sports, major organizations and series will look to see where to find the next generation of talent."
