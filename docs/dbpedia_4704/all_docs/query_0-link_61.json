        "text": "These are some of the most common types of difficulties or issues we can help with if you have been unable to resolve the issue by contacting USCIS. Also, see our Web Alerts for recent updates that may affect you if you want to request case assistance.\n\nUndelivered USCIS notices or decisions\n\nSuch as receipt notices, requests for evidence, appointment notices, or denial notices where USCIS systems indicate that it issued one, or instances where the U.S. Postal Service returned a card or document to USCIS as non-deliverable.\n\nAging out of eligibility\n\nCertain cases where the beneficiary may “age out” of eligibility for the requested immigration benefit. See USCIS’ Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) page for additional information.\n\nU.S. military personnel\n\nCertain cases involving U.S. military personnel and their families.\n\nImproper rejections\n\nApplications and petitions that were improperly rejected by USCIS due to clear errors of fact or obvious misapplication of the relevant law.\n\nTypographical errors\n\nTypographic errors (such as the wrong name or date of birth) in immigration documents, such as Green Cards or employment authorization documents.\n\nEmergency or hardship\n\nCertain cases involving an emergency or a hardship that fall under the USCIS expedite criteria.\n\nExpedites\n\nExpedite requests approved by USCIS more than 2 months ago.\n\nTransfers to the Department of State\n\nDelays in sending approved petitions to the Department of State.\n\nForm I-134A (only three types of issues)\n\nWe can help with only these three issues for Form I-134A cases for the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) parole processes. See our web alert for more information.\n\nCorrecting certain typographical errors (such as an email address or name) on your pending Form I-134A before U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issues the travel authorization;\n\nAssisting when some family members have received their travel authorization, but other family members are still waiting; or\n\nGetting a copy of the previously issued confirmation notice that was emailed to the beneficiary so they can set up their USCIS online account.\n\nWith few exceptions, we cannot help if:\n\nIt is before the case inquiry date for your case\n\nYou can find your case inquiry date on USCIS' Check Case Processing Times page under the \"When can I ask about my case?\" section after choosing your form category and USCIS location.\n\nThe two exceptions (cases we can help with) are:\n\nIf there is a statutory or regulatory processing time requirement (such as Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, for Special Immigrant Juveniles; Form N-400, Application for Naturalization; and Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, for L-1 petitions), or\n\nUSCIS approved your expedite request more than 60 days ago.\n\nThere are no published processing times and you have not waited 6 months\n\nWe cannot help if there is no published processing time for the form type, and less than 6 months have passed since you filed your form with USCIS and submitted a case inquiry to USCIS.\n\nYou are asking about Form I-134A delays, expedites, or overturning a decision\n\nWe cannot help if your concern is related to a Form I-134A processing delay or expedite request, or you want to overturn (or get an explanation for) a decision not to confirm or authorize travel. USCIS is not accepting expedite requests and does not provide explanations for these decisions.\n\nYour expedite request was denied\n\nWe cannot help if USCIS recently denied your expedite request.\n\nYou want legal advice\n\nWe cannot give you legal advice.\n\nYou want help with issues that do not involve USCIS\n\nWe only have the authority to work on issues involving USCIS.\n\nA congressional representative is currently inquiring for you\n\nWe cannot help if it has been fewer than 45 calendar days since your congressional representative made an inquiry to USCIS.\n\nWe also cannot:\n\nReplace the formal appeal or motion process or change the deadline for submitting an appeal.\n\nCommunicate with anyone other than the benefit requestor (the individual who signed the submitted form to USCIS) or the attorney without written consent from the benefit requestor.\n\nIf you are applying, or applied, for T, U, VAWA, or refugee status and do not have an attorney or accredited representative, your address must match the address in USCIS systems. We can only communicate with you via U.S. postal mail to comply with the law and keep your case confidential.\n\nCompel USCIS to take action on a pending application, petition, or request.\n\nFix actions resulting from bad information given by third parties, such as legal representatives or DSOs.\n\nHere are the steps in our case assistance process after you submit a DHS Form 7001, Request for Case Assistance. To ensure that you receive our emails, please add cisombudsman@hq.dhs.gov to your email contacts.\n\nYou will receive a confirmation email\n\nWe email you or your legal representative a confirmation that we received your case assistance request. The email will include your CIS Ombudsman Request Number and a copy of your DHS Form 7001.\n\nIf you submit DHS Form 7001 online, you will typically receive the email within 24 hours.\n\nIf you email or mail DHS Form 7001, you will receive your CIS Ombudsman Request Number by email or mail after we enter the information into our system. This can take two to three weeks or more.\n\nIf you requested that we communicate with you only by mail (or we are required to), we will mail you a letter with your CIS Ombudsman Request Number.\n\nIf you are an applicant or self-petitioner for (or were previously granted) T, U, VAWA, asylee, or refugee status, we can only communicate with you by sending mail to the address listed for you in USCIS systems to follow the law and keep your case confidential.\n\nWe can communicate with your legal representative if the information in USCIS systems matches the information in Section 10 of the DHS Form 7001 and a Form G-28 was provided to us for the form you are seeking assistance with.\n\nYou can use your CIS Ombudsman Request Number to Check the Status of Your Request.\n\nWe will assign your request\n\nWe review your response in Section 2 of the DHS Form 7001 to determine the primary reason you are seeking our assistance and how to prioritize your request.\n\nOur goal is to assign requests that fall under one of our priority issues to an analyst within 14 business days. Priority issues are ones that USCIS can quickly address.\n\nRequests involving only USCIS processing delays may take longer to be assigned to one of our analysts.\n\nWe are reviewing your request\n\nIf we need more information, we will email you and ask you to respond within 5 calendar days.\n\nUse the Upload Requested Documents (after submitting your request) tab on our online DHS Form 7001 page to submit the requested documents or other documents that you have not already submitted.\n\nWe research USCIS systems, applicable laws, regulations, and policies and review USCIS processing times to see if we can assist you.\n\nIf we cannot assist you, we move to Step 5 below.\n\nWe contacted USCIS about your request\n\nIf we can assist, we will contact the appropriate USCIS office about the issue described for the primary form listed on the DHS Form 7001, and we will email you to let you know.\n\nWe will follow up with USCIS (and notify you) until we receive a response that addresses the main issue in your request.\n\nWe closed your request\n\nWe close your request if it is not the type of issue we can help with.\n\nOtherwise, we close your request after USCIS addresses our inquiry.\n\nWhile we are working on your request, you do not need to contact us unless your situation has changed. For example, email us at cisombudsman@hq.dhs.gov if:\n\nYour case is resolved by USCIS after you submit a case assistance request (include your CIS Ombudsman Request Number).\n\nYour address changes. You must also change your address with USCIS (you will need the receipt numbers for all pending applications or petitions).\n\nYou have a new attorney representing you for the specific form listed on your DHS Form 7001."
