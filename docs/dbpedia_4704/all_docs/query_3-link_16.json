        "text": "When is K1 Circuit Opening?\n\nWe’re hoping to open K1 Circuit to the public soon, pending city/county approvals.\n\nHow Much Does K1 Circuit Cost?\n\nWe’re still finishing up the final pricing, but our tentative pricing is currently up on this website. For Arrive & Drive rental pricing, please visit our Kart Rental page, and for “bring your own kart” pricing, please visit our Kart Owners page.\n\nCan I Rent Out the Entire K1 Circuit Track?\n\nYes! Soon after we open up, we will allow people to rent out our entire track. Pricing for this is to be determined.\n\nWhat are the Hours of Operation?\n\nWhen we open, K1 Circuit will be open every day from 9am to 9pm. Open Practice for kart owners will be held from 9am to 5pm, while rentals will operate from 12pm to 9pm. After the completion of open practice, rentals will be available on two course configurations from 5pm to 9pm.\n\nHow Old Do You Have to Be To Drive the Rentals at K1 Circuit?\n\nAll drivers who want to rent our karts at K1 Circuit must be at least 16 years old with an active Driver’s License. Plus, drivers must be at 58″ tall and safely reach the pedals and steering wheel.\n\nALL drivers under the age of 18 will need a parent or legal guardian present with a valid ID to sign their waiver, including OPEN PRACTICE drivers – not just for rentals!\n\nHow Long Are Sessions at K1 Circuit?\n\nK1 Circuit will operate in 10-minute blocks. So it’s up to the driver as far as how many laps can be completed in that given time. Currently, our rental karts are capable of producing roughly 80-second lap times around the full Pro Track layout, but we do expect this to get shorter as the track “rubbers” in and gets more grip, which means more laps!\n\nWill You Run Group Events at K1 Circuit?\n\nYes, K1 Circuit will host group events sometime after we open!\n\nAre You Hiring at K1 Circuit?\n\nWe are not currently hiring at K1 Circuit, however we are accepting resumes if you are interested in working for us when we do start hiring.

Please visit our Kart Storage for more information about that!\n\nCan I Drive My Motorcycle or Car on K1 Circuit?\n\nNo, we will not allow people to drive their motorcycles or cars on K1 Circuit.

While K1 Circuit will only use electric karts for their rentals, those bringing their own karts can use traditional gas-powered go karts.\n\nWhat is the Best Way to Contact K1 Circuit?\n\nRight now, the best way to contact K1 Circuit is by either submitting our form located on our Contact Us page, or getting in touch with our General Manager, Mike Smith, directly at mike.smith@k1circuit.com.\n\nWhat Clothing Can I Wear at K1 Circuit?\n\nDrivers at K1 Circuit must wear abrasion-resistant uppers (either karting-specific jackets or motorcycle-style protective jackets), full-length denim jeans, a DOT-approved helmet with a full-face visor (no goggles), gloves, and closed-toe shoes. We strongly recommend a full karting suit (upper and pants). If you do not own any abrasion-resistant clothing, we will offer rental suits to wear during your visit. No Nomex suits!\n\nAll guests must wear shoes. No bare feet allowed.\n\nWill You Sell Karts There?\n\nYes, we will sell our OTL E-Pro Kart at K1 Circuit!

Specifics about that point system will become available later.\n\nWill You Provide Kart Maintenance at K1 Circuit?\n\nYes, we will provide kart maintenance at K1 Circuit for not only our own karts, but your karts as well.\n\nWhat Kart Series Will Run at K1 Circuit?\n\nK1 Circuit has had conversations with multiple karting series, including Los Angeles Karting Championship (LAKC), Tri-C Karters, SKUSA Pro-Kart Challenge, and the Challenge of the Americas Winter Championship.\n\nWill There Be Night Races at K1 Circuit?\n\nYes, there will be night races at K1 Circuit!
