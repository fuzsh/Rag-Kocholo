        "text": "K1 Speed is waving the green flag inside the Cambridge Centre mall today.\n\nThe electric go-kart track is officially open and welcoming racers.\n\nDaniel Zychlinski and Mark Bingeman are the two men behind bringing indoor go-karts to Cambridge.\n\nZychlinski, the managing partner for K1 Speed Canada, was thrilled when presented with the opportunity to take over the space where the old ice rink used to be.\n\n\"When we saw it, we thought 'what an unbelievable opportunity,'\" he said earlier this month.\n\n\"We rarely have an opportunity to be inside of a mall. It's hard to work with and make sure the site meets our requirements but this one did. The exposure we get from it is very rare to us.\"\n\nHe also believes having the attraction will benefit other businesses inside the mall, while providing a much needed source of entertainment to residents of Cambridge and the surrounding area.\n\n\"It'll bring people by other retail stores,\" he said.\n\n\"There isn't a lot of entertainment around and having Guelph and Kitchener nearby makes it a good opportunity for us. We believe people need this kind of entertainment.\""
