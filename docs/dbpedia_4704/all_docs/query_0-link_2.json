        "text": "All new riders will receive a mandatory briefing session on indoor kart racing safety and regulations. K1 Speed recommends racers wear closed toe shoes and long hair should be pulled back into a ponytail. We will provide you with all the racing gear needed. Please remember that indoor Karting is real racing and not an amusement ride. Accidents can happen if you do not follow the rules and pay attention to flags.\n\nWe cannot emphasize enough that indoor kart racing is a non-contact sport. We do not tolerate any bumping or blocking of go karts. If you are unable to pass a kart, there is no excuse for contact. K1 Speed has a strict, zero-tolerance policy regarding alcohol and/or drug abuse. Anyone who appears to be under the influence will not be permitted to race. Kart racing poses special risks to those with neck or back problems and heart conditions. Women who are pregnant, and anyone who should not be in a stressful or physically demanding environment, should not race. If you have any doubt, please check with your doctor prior to racing."
