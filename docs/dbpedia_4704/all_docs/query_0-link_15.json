        "text": "Everyone knows that K1 Speed is the place to visit for a safe, state-of-the-art, authentic racing experience. For the last 15 years, our indoor electric go-karting has attracted millions of racers, from your neighbor down the street to pros like Hamilton, Rossi, and Busch.\n\nBut what can you do once you’ve finished racing at K1 Speed? Or what do you do if adrenaline-pumping experiences aren’t for you? Or what if you need to kill some time while waiting for your next race, or while your child is racing? We also know not everyone can meet the minimum height requirement of 48” – what then? Well, this post will answer all those questions.\n\nTest Other Skills in our Arcade\n\nNearly all of our centers have a video game arcade where visitors can test other skills against one another. Perhaps you’re better at arcade racing than the real deal. Some of our arcades feature arcade driving games like Cruis’n Blast (pictured above). Or maybe you’re more of a first-person shooter kind of player – try out our action video games, like the Jurassic Park arcade game in Irvine, for example. Love old school arcade? Some locations feature pinball machines, like the AC/DC themed game! Check out or call your local K1 Speed and see what arcade games we offer there!\n\nCyberSport and Bowling\n\nAt Addison, we offer CyberSport , a combination of lacrosse, basketball and hockey while driving custom-designed Cyber Cars. You’ll love this unique experience not commonly found at a go-karting center!\n\nAt our Orlando center, visitors can enjoy our miniature bowling alley and compete for strikes in between races.\n\nPlay Old-School Games like Pool, Foosball, Jenga and Cornhole\n\nSo, video games aren’t your thing. We get it. Fortunately for you, we usually stock games that have existed for decades and still haven’t gone out of style.\n\nGo back to gaming roots with a rousing game of billiards on one of our pool tables, available at most of our locations. Some locations even have foosball tables, so you can channel your inner Messi. Your local center may also have an air-hockey table, so you can test your hand-eye coordination and reflexes which are crucial skills for a racing driver to hone.\n\nLove playing hoops? Show off your accuracy on one of our arcade basketball games. Or test yourself during a feat of strength with our boxing arcade game at select locations.\n\nAt Dublin, Austin, Boston, Ft Lauderdale, and Irvine, we even offer a large Jenga set and a cornhole setup free of charge for you to enjoy.\n\nBrowse our Apparel and Accessories\n\nWe’re constantly introducing new t-shirt, hoodie, and hat designs that appeal to racers of all ages – from more traditional-looking to the latest trendy designs, there’s a K1 Speed apparel item that has your name on it.\n\nOr represent your love for K1 Speed with one of our awesome accessories – like our K1 Speed license plate frame or set of decals to display on your vehicle.\n\nThose in possession of a K1 Speed annual license receive 10% off your apparel or accessories purchase, so take advantage of the money you can save!\n\nEnjoy Food & Beverages at our Paddock Lounge or Pit Café\n\nKarting is a physical activity. Make sure you stay hydrated by visiting our on-site Paddock Lounge or Pit Café for a selection of beverages. If you’re done racing and are of legal age, enjoy an ice-cold beer or relax with a glass of wine.\n\nYou can get pretty hungry after racing too – so load up on carbs and protein with our delicious food and snacks we have available. At our Paddock Lounge, we offer delicious food like our cheesy pizzas, hot wings, and layered nachos.\n\nStudy Other Racers on Track\n\nSometimes it’s difficult to gauge if what you’re doing on track is the fastest or not. One of the best ways to learn is by observing quicker racers than you. While you’re waiting next time, take a look at the racers out on track – are they posting faster lap times? Investigate what they’re doing that you’re not. Are they turning smoother or taking a different approach and line to a corner? Or maybe they’re just lifting instead of braking into the corner. This alone could shave some tenths off your time. If there’s slower drivers out there on track, try to pinpoint where you might be going faster than them and make sure you keep doing that correctly."
