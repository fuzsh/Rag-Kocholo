        "text": "K1 Speed is an American go-kart racetrack franchise based in Irvine, California.[1] The company was co-founded in 2003 by David Danglard and Susan Danglard, who had previously worked in the fashion industry.[2][3] That same year, K1 Speed opened their first go-kart track outside San Diego, California.[1]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Italian OTL electric karts used at K1 speed can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour once unlocked to their full horsepower potential. The Junior karts can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour.\n\nIn late 2018, K1 Speed said that they were partnering with virtual and augmented reality brand Oculus to use their Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and several cameras monitoring a track to give K1 Speed's go-kart users a virtual racing experience.[4]\n\nK1 Speed has over 90 locations across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Scotland, Mexico, Dominican Republic, South Korea, Puerto Rico, Kuwait, Italy, China and France.[1][5][6]"
