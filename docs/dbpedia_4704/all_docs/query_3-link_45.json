        "text": "As the petitioner or applicant (or attorney or representative), you must complete and sign Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, according to the instructions (PDF, 224.67 KB) on the current version of the form. If you are filing Form I-907 together with Form I-129 or Form I-140, you must file both forms according to the Form I-129 instructions (PDF, 549.11 KB)or Form I-140 instructions based on the form that you filed (PDF, 395.08 KB).\n\nIf you have already filed Form I-129 and you now wish to request premium processing:\n\nFile Form I-907 using the instructions on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, webpage, along with a copy of the Form I-797, Receipt Notice, for your Form I-129.\n\nIf we transferred your Form I-129 petition to another service center and you received a transfer notice, submit your Form I-907 to the location listed on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, webpage. You should also include a copy of the transfer notice with your premium processing request to avoid delays.\n\nIf you have already filed Form I-140 and you now wish to request premium processing:\n\nFile Form I-907 with the service center where your Form I-140 is currently pending, along with a copy of the Form I-797, Receipt Notice, for your Form I-140.\n\nIf we transferred your Form I-140 petition to another service center and you received a transfer notice, we strongly recommend that you submit your Form I-907 to the service center that is now handling your petition. You should also include a copy of the transfer notice with your premium processing request to avoid delays.\n\nFor Form I-140 and I-129 petitions that are filed together with Form I-907, we will reject both the underlying petition and request for premium processing if they are not filed at the correct location. The filing location is based on the underlying petition. A listing of those locations can be found on either the I-129 or I-140 Direct Filing Addresses webpage.\n\nFor Form I-140 petitions we will not reject any standalone Form I-907 that is mistakenly filed at a service center without geographic jurisdiction over the underlying Form I-140 petition. We will reject any standalone I-907 filed at a Lockbox, because it was not filed at the correct location. For incorrectly filed Forms I-907, the premium processing time period begins on the date the correct service center receives the file, as indicated in the Form I-907 filing instructions.\n\nFor Form I-129 petitions, we will reject any standalone Form I-907 that is not filed at the correct location listed on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, webpage. The underlying petition’s current location may not be the same as the proper filing location on this webpage. Once we receive the Form I-907 at the proper location as listed on the Direct Filing Addresses webpage, we electronically match the Form I-907 to your Form I-129 petition.\n\nIf you are an F-1 student and you have already filed Form I-765 requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension and you now wish to request premium processing, file Form I-907 online or with the Chicago Lockbox.\n\nFor Form I-765: (c)(3)(A), (c)(3)(B), (c)(3)(C) requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension, Form I-907 will be rejected if the application is not an eligible category for premium processing or if we are not able to match your Form I-907 with the receipt for your Form I-765 requesting OPT or a STEM OPT extension. Furthermore, if you submit a single payment for concurrent fillings, we will reject the forms for improper fee payment.\n\nSince June 13, 2023, USCIS has been accepting Form I-907 requests filed via paper form or online, for nonimmigrants who have a pending Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, and requested a change of status to one of the following:\n\nF-1 Academic Student or F-2 Dependent of F-1;\n\nM-1 Vocational Student or M-2 Dependent of M-1;\n\nJ-1 Exchange Visitor or J-2 Dependent of J-1.\n\nIf you already submitted Form I-539 to request a change of status to one of these classifications, and you want to request premium processing, file Form I-907 online or on paper with the appropriate Lockbox. You must file Form I-907 the same way you submitted Form I-539 (online or via paper form.)\n\nSince June 26, 2023, has been accepting Form I-907 requests filed via paper form or online, for applicants seeking to change into F-1, F-2, M-1, M-2, J-1, or J-2 status, when filed together with their Form I-539.\n\nFor Form I-539 requesting a change of status to F-1, F-2, M-1, M-2, J-1, or J-2 status, Form I-907 will be rejected if the application is not an eligible category for premium processing or if we are not able to match your Form I-907 with the receipt for your Form I-539 requesting a change of status.\n\nPlease note that when requesting premium processing, either by filing the Form I-907 together with the eligible form (such as Form I-140 or I-129) or for a previously filed eligible form, you must submit only one Form I-907 for the one eligible form or classification. Do not submit unrelated Forms I-907 in the same envelope. This will delay the processing of your request.\n\nFor example, if you are filing a Form I-140 and seek premium processing for that Form I-140, you would submit the Form I-140 with Form I-907. However, do not submit multiple Forms I-907 for the same Form I-140 and do not include Forms I-907 for other Forms I-140 that you might have submitted previously. This will delay the processing of your request.\n\nThose who pay for premium processing on petitions filed for nonimmigrant classifications that are subject to annual numerical (“cap”) limits will not have an unfair access to these limited immigration programs.\n\nIf necessary, we will apply a random selection process to all petitions received on the final receipt date for cap-subject H-2B and H-3 petitions, regardless of whether premium processing is requested. We will adjudicate these randomly selected cases and will reject and return the fees for any unselected cases, as well as cases that were filed after the final receipt date.\n\nIf necessary, for the H-1B cap, we will apply a random selection process to all registrations received during the initial registration period or final registration date. If we suspend the registration process, we will apply a random selection process to all petitions received on the final receipt date for cap-subject H-1B petitions, regardless of whether premium processing is requested. If the final receipt date is any of the first five business days on which petitions subject to the H-1B regular cap may be received (i.e., if the cap is reached on any one of the first five business days that filings can be made), we will randomly select from among all the petitions properly submitted during the first five business days the number of petitions deemed necessary to meet the H-1B cap. In either scenario, we will adjudicate these randomly selected petitions and will reject and return the fees for any unselected petitions, as well as petitions that were filed after the final receipt date."
