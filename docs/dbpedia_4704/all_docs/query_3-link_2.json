        "text": "Our original form of racing is still the most popular format of racing today at K1 Speed locations all around the world!\n\nThere’s no reservation or appointment needed to enjoy Arrive & Drive racing. As the name suggests, simply arrive at any of our K1 Speed locations and go racing!\n\nThese races typically last between 7-10 minutes and are an open time-trial session where you compete for fastest lap rather than position on track.\n\nPassing other karts isn’t a requirement in this format of racing. Quite the contrary, actually. You’ll want some clear space in front of you, so you can lay down the fastest lap you can. The racer with the fastest lap time is deemed the winner of the race.\n\nIf you have a group of 8 or more racers, then look into our group events! When you book a group event, you’ll not only have a reserved start time, but you’ll racing with only your group, and you’ll have a race for position!\n\nHere are the kinds of races available in our group event packages:\n\nPractice Race: this is all about getting used to the kart and the track. You’ll rank by fastest lap, but it doesn’t matter if you’re not the quickest in this session.\n\nQualifying Race: Set your fastest lap during this race session, as you’ll line up for the next race based on how well you finish. If you set the fastest lap time, you’ll get pole position. This means you’re starting in first position in the final race, and it’s down to you to keep it that way.\n\nFinal Race: The race that really counts! This race is for position, which means it doesn’t matter who sets the fastest lap. You just want to be the first person that sees the checkered flag! If someone’s in front, pass them! Got someone behind you? Don’t let them pass! The racers that finish in the top three positions are awarded during our podium ceremony.\n\nIf you’re looking for more of a challenge than just your friends, family, or coworkers, then participate in our competitive Junior/Teen League or Challenge GP races. Our fastest racers attend these events, so it’s a terrific way for you to gauge your talent and improve your racing skills.\n\nThese races are held monthly, and points are accumulated throughout the year – just like a professional championship.\n\nThe format is similar to our group event races in that you’ll race in a qualifying session and a final race for position. The final event of the year includes a practice session as well.\n\nFor more information about these racing series, including the cost and schedule, click one of the buttons below!\n\nDrift Night\n\nDrift Night is when we equip our go karts with drifting sleeves on our rear tires. As a result, the kart’s rear end loosens up, transforming it into a drift kart! Drift Night is a perfect opportunity to learn the basics of drifting in a safe, controlled environment without risking your car or other people’s property.\n\nThese races don’t have as many laps as our Arrive & Drive races, but then again, you’re not doing the same kind of lap times either. There’s a learning curve to this kind of racing, but once you get the hang of it, you won’t want to stop!\n\nK1NG of Speed\n\nK1NG of Speed is a popular event held three times a year. This event eliminates using our karts as an excuse for any lackluster lap time. Up to 16 racers compete in this knockout-style tournament that randomly pairs up drivers. Each driver then completes a session in both their kart and their paired rival’s kart. The driver with the fastest combined lap time progresses to the next pairing. This continues until we have a K1NG of Speed!\n\nEndless Racing\n\nOur Endless Racing event has only been held once in the company’s history, but you never know when it’ll surface again! Racers are given three hours to do as much racing as they can for one low cost. Races are limited to 10 laps and points are not rewarded. Instead, racers simply line up for races – as soon as they finished one, they get back in line to wait for their next one! It’s a terrific event, so it’s likely to make a reappearance – be sure to check your emails, follow us on social, and check this website often so you don’t miss the next one!\n\nEndurance Races\n\nThis event is probably the most rare and hasn’t even occurred at all of our locations yet. Typically our endurance race is a competition for tickets to a professional race, or to raise money for charity. Teams are usually broken into three different positions with their own duties: driver, driver on deck, and lap counter. Every member rotates between each position throughout the competition. Think of it as a relay race, K1 Speed-style!"
