        "text": "Irvine-based K1 Speed has acquired go-kart operators Autobahn and Accelerate Indoor Speedway in January, adding 11 more racing locations to its portfolio.\n\nThe deal marks the largest acquisition for the company to date. K1 Speed now operates 83 locations in seven countries, up from the 60 spots K1 counted at the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe 11 new locations bring K1 into four states, Maryland, New York, Wisconsin and Alabama, for the first time. K1 is renovating each go-kart center to match the look and offerings of its standard locations over the next few weeks by adding concession stands and arcades to the new spaces.\n\nThis year will mark the opening of K1â€™s first outdoor speedway as one of the newer concepts on tap for the company. Additional custom facilities are in the works as well.\n\nK1 Speed moved from Carlsbad to its Irvine headquarters in 2006 as it began to expand its footprint. Annual revenue is estimated by the Business Journal to top $120 million."
