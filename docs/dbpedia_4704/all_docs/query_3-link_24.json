        "text": "Race #1: July 12th\n\nReview: I was very disappointed with my results. I tried a bad technique that works in GT6, however all it does in real life it makes you slow down and violently vibrate, forming bruises within minutes.\n\nResults:\n\nQualifying:\n\nRound 1:\n\n1st............ 26.953\n\n2nd........... 27.087\n\n3rd............ 27.122\n\n4th............ 27.162\n\n5th............ 27.348\n\n6th............ 27.487\n\n7th............ 27.962\n\nRound 2:\n\nLost the scoring sheet. Oops. My time was 7th... with a 27.6 and the person in behind me got a 27.2 in.\n\nRace:\n\nCaution Lap 2: 2 Karts malfunctioned and automatically applied the brakes. The cars were in 3rd and 6th, I believe. I crashed into the 6th place one, but it was only a small 5 mph tap.\n\nAfter the caution was removed the now 7th and 5th place drivers had new karts, but lost valuable seconds of time.\n\nFinal:\n\n1.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.678, Points earned: 16\n\n2.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.886, Points earned: 12\n\n3.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.836, Points earned: 10\n\n4.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.942, Points earned: 8\n\n5.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.800, Points earned: 6\n\n6.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 27.132, Points earned: 4\n\n7.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.987, Points earned: 2\n\nRace #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1 ------ Race #1\n\nRace #2: August 4th\n\nReview: This race was absolutely amazing, I wish I had an onboard camera, I had a 13 lap battle for position that's gap was never more than 2 tenths of a second for the whole 16 laps of the race.\n\nResults:\n\nQualifying:\n\nRound 1:\n\nI was late and couldn't attend QP #1, so I also don't have a results sheet.\n\nRound 2:\n\n1st............ 26.597\n\n2nd........... 26.909\n\n3rd............ 27.162\n\n4th............ 27.226\n\n5th............ 27.680\n\n6th............ 27.700\n\n7th............ 27.943\n\n8th............ 27.950\n\nRace:\n\nThe battle: I started in 6th, the green flag dropped, I was on the tail of the 5th place car within half a lap. After a few laps I tried the inside, got side by side. But on the next turn he had the inside and retook his position. Two laps later I tried the same move again. Again unsuccessful. Now at approximately lap 9 we are approaching a lap car very quickly, I go for the inside, lock up my brakes! Nearly lose control, maybe even tap his kart! The pass would be successful, but the lapped kart blocks my line. And a few turns later 5th gets by him. Then 4 turns later I'm thinking, \"I need to pass this guy NOW!\" So I dive to the inside on a non-passing corner, and he lets me by. I promptly catch 5th over the next lap and a half. I GO TO THE INSIDE IN THE SAME CORNER AGAIN!! STILL SEARCHING FOR THAT PASS! I GET a NOSE ON HIM! Caution is out on lap 13. I slowly drive away after the drop of the green and finish in 5th place. This race was magnificent. I wish I had a reply to show you all. But I didn't have a camera attached. The car that was lapped had a go pro on it. But I don't think the driver will post it unfortunately due to his being lapped and all.\n\nFinal:\n\n1.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.736, Points earned: 16\n\n2.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.886, Points earned: 16\n\n3.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.990, Points earned: 12\n\n4.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 27.721, Points earned: 10\n\n5.............. 15 laps, Best lap: 27.380, Points earned: 8\n\n6.............. 15 laps, Best lap: 27.308, Points earned: 6\n\n7.............. 15 laps, Best lap: 27.975, Points earned: 4\n\n8.............. 11 laps, Best lap: 26.997, Points earned: 2\n\nRace #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2 ------ Race #2\n\nRace #3: September 6th\n\nReview: This race was good, but not as great as I had hoped. I learned a lot on this day, most of which I already learned from Gran Turismo 6, but had yet to be able to transition into the real world. And my results should've been better. in Qualifying #1, I started in the back and the traffic was terrible, I had 1 guy blocking me intentionally... IN QUALIFYING! Then after I got by him I caught the next guy in 2 laps, and he was nice and let me by, but I still lost time. Traffic was just really bad in QP#1. I started the race in 4th. But my karts speed limiter malfunctioned, and I started in 4th with a train behind me, 10 seconds behind 3rd place. Still good practice though. I got a lot of experience in being attacked, and how to push pesky wide karts out of the racing line tonight. Attacking is a lot easier than defense. More fun too.\n\nResults:\n\nNon-official Practice:\n\nPublic session (Slow traffic and yellows) Asterisk marks GP drivers*:\n\n1st............ 27.063*\n\n2nd........... 27.088*\n\n3rd............ 28.017*\n\n4th............ 30.353\n\n5th............ 31.869\n\n6th............ 31.893\n\n7th............ 32.795\n\n8th............ 33.623\n\n9th............ 34.408\n\n10th............ 34.485\n\nQualifying:\n\nRound 1:\n\n1st............ 26.809\n\n2nd........... 26.963\n\n3rd............ 27.169\n\n4th............ 27.224\n\n5th............ 27.302\n\n6th............ 27.620\n\n7th............ 27.700\n\n8th............ 27.986\n\nRound 2:\n\n1st............ 26.902\n\n2nd........... 26.967\n\n3rd............ 26.982\n\n4th............ 27.072\n\n5th............ 27.103\n\n6th............ 27.134\n\n7th............ 27.202\n\n7th............ 27.226\n\nRace:\n\nI have already expressed my discontent about the start of the race, but I don't think I have accurately described the battles on track. The 5th place car was quickly passed by a faster driver. Who caught me at around lap 11 out of 16. His average lap time was only 0.038 faster than mine. And he bumped me hard, trying to pressure me into making a mistake. But I took a defensive line. It slowed me down my 3 tenths a lap, but it blocked his passing opportunities, I was able to hold position to the checkered flag.\n\nFinal:\n\n1.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.748, Points earned: 18\n\n2.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.827, Points earned: 14\n\n3.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 27.031, Points earned: 12\n\n4.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.817, Points earned: 10\n\n5.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 26.633, Points earned: 8\n\n6.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 27.190, Points earned: 6\n\n7.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 27.200, Points earned: 4\n\n8.............. 16 laps, Best lap: 27.245, Points earned: 2\n\nRace #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3 ------ Race #3\n\nI went to K1 Speed for my first time in Poughkeepsie while I was visiting some family down there in NY. I immediately showed some decent speed, but for one reason or another, I didn't quite break in to the top weekly or monthly lap times 👎. I think I was about 2-3 seconds off pace. I really gave it my all (I was truly flying, I could feel the limits being pushed....quite a lot of fun:tup , but traffic definitely played a factor. Still, I was first in one race and 2nd in another, so I'll still take that!\n\nThere is another one about an hour and change in MA somewhere, but I feel if I'm gonna travel that far, why not just go to F1 Boston which is closer (have not been yet). Even better, there is a close by indoor kart track I gotta check out, so that's good. There is also some sort of real karting league at the NH Motor speedway, so that might be an option, albeit probably 10x more expensive!\n\nIt still would almost seem GT Academy gives me a better shot than actual karting when it comes to starting a racing career .\n\nBut back on the topic of K1, after I visited and noticed they have a league of sorts for each track, it got me thinking just like you. It's not like it isn't real racing, so it definitely helps experience wise. I imagine though if you wanted to get more serious you'd have to step up to karts with engines and race on official tracks."
