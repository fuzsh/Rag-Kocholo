        "text": "JACKSON TWP. – James Burley smiled and then paused.\n\nHis dream realized.\n\n\"Whew,\" Burley said, taking a breath. \"It's exciting. It's emotional.\"\n\nBurley owns the newest attraction in the Stark County area, K1 Speed Canton, an indoor electric go-kart track facility that opened Wednesday.\n\nMore: K1 Speed go-kart racing coming to Jackson Township\n\nMore: Time to hit the (non) ice! Jackson Twp. opens artificial skating rink\n\nK1 Speed Canton is at 8373 Port Jackson Ave. NW near the Center Ice Sports Complex and the Akron-Canton Airport.\n\nIt is the first Ohio franchise for K1 Speed, a California-based company and the world's largest indoor go-kart racing operator.\n\n\"I think it's nice because the closest place (for indoor, electric go-karts) around here is Medina,\" said Mitch Shannon, a North Canton resident who raced a couple times.\n\nHis friend Matthew Beaber, also of North Canton, added: \"It was fun. The turns are challenging but other than it's a good time.\"\n\nK1 Speed features include hybrid track\n\nThe franchise-owned K1 Speed in Stark County will feature the parent company's first hybrid indoor-outdoor track.\n\nThe outdoor extension remains under construction.\n\nIn the meantime, racers can enjoy the indoor configurations that include 12 laps and adult go-karts that reach speeds of 45 mph. The facility also has junior go-karts for children 4 feet or taller that max out at 20 mph. No one under 4 feet can race.\n\nThe track also includes a large LED screen that displays racer times.\n\nK1 Speed Canton also has an eatery that serves food and drinks, a private room for parties or other events and will add an arcade.\n\nBurley said the facility also will host go-kart leagues.\n\nUli Perez, international franchise manager and operations quality control manager for K1 Speed, has been helping Burley and his crew get the Stark County location open.\n\n\"With Mid-Ohio being a local race track out here,\" Perez said, \"there's a lot of racers that I see out here that are going to want to have their kids' birthdays at a race track, something they relate to.\"\n\nPerez said the facility can be rented for parties.\n\nStaying true to success\n\nPerez said K1 has 55 locations worldwide — 34 are corporate and the rest are franchises — with plans to expand. Among the international locations include Canada, China, Mexico and South Korea.\n\nHe said the company's success keeps its focus on its primary attraction.\n\n\"We don't veer from what we offer, which is the racing experience and being a family-oriented entertainment facility,\" Perez said.\n\nBuilding family relationships\n\nBurley, a Jackson High graduate, has enjoyed a lifelong passion for race cars. It started with his father, George, an engineer, who worked 40 years at Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.\n\nIn 1973, his father, now retired, helped create a new machine that labeled \"Firestone Firehawk\" on Indy Car racing tires. That drew Burley into the sport.\n\nK1 Speed Canton features an Indianapolis 500 race car as its centerpiece display.\n\nBurley said he had an itch to open an go-kart facility locally, and approached K1 Speed with franchise plans. The process took two years but he got the green flag to open Wednesday.\n\nAnd Burley, a former youth minister, said he hopes his facility won't just entertain but also strengthen bonds between families and friends.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's dads and sons, moms and daughters, or uncles and aunts,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter the relationship. If a facility like this can build family relationships, then we've done our part.\"\n\nReach Benjamin Duer at 330-580-8567 or ben.duer@cantonrep.com\n\nFollow on Twitter @bduerREP\n\nMore details\n\nWhat: K1 Speed Canton, a new indoor/outdoor go-kart business\n\nWhere: 8373 Port Jackson Ave. NW, Jackson Township\n\nCost: $24.95 per race; $44.95 for two races; $59.95 for three races\n\nHours: Noon to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday; noon to 12 a.m. Friday; 10 a.m. to 12 a.m. Saturday; and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday."
