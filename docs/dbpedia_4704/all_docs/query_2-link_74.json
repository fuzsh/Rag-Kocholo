        "text": "Clubspeed offers a robust list of features for karting and activity centers that continues to grow as the demands of our customers become more complex. The needs of karting facilities are unique and we are committed to delivering features that help our customers run their business with ease and efficiency.\n\nClubspeed proudly sponsored the Second Annual American E-Kart Championship (AEKC) held this past weekend at Accelerate Indoor Speedway & Events in Mokena, Illinois, showcasing 22 of the fastest indoor e-kart drivers in the country. The three day event began with qualifiers on Friday, August 23rd and completed on Sunday. Ryan Wilson emerged victorious, winning a cool $10,000 cash prize for first place. Coming in a close second, Koby Phipps walked away with $2,500 and third place Bailey Tolson is going home with $1,000.\n\nFounded in 2003, K1 Speed is a premier indoor go-karting center that has grown to over 40 locations in 7 countries. Offering highly-advanced, electric go-karts as well as large indoor entertainment venues that feature authentic racing memorabilia, pit cafes, meeting rooms and pool tables, K1 is a great place to visit with family and friends or to host a corporate event or party.\n\nGo karts may not be the only activity you offer at your family entertainment center, but they are surely a main attraction for customers to visit. Take your karting up a notch and add a layer of competition with timing technology.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we attended the International Kart Association (IKA) annual expo in Offenbach, Germany as an official exhibitor. We were able to talk with reps from karting tracks as well as industry experts from all over the world to learn about the latest trends in track design and kart innovation.\n\nAre you on a maintenance schedule for your karts? You likely know the basics like refueling when the tank is empty and filling tires with sufficient air. But without a formal schedule, there are certain measures you should be taking that could slip through the cracks. A well-maintained kart is more reliable and performs better, keeping racers safe and satisfied with their experience at your track.\n\nRead this checklist to help with your kart upkeep."
