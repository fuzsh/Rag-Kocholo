In addition to the track, the Sacramento center features a museum-quality collection of authentic racing memorabilia, including signed race apparel, full-size racecars, and collectible artwork.\n\nWhen not perusing through the collection, guests can relax in the spacious lobby, purchase snacks and refreshments at the Pit Café snack bar, play video games in-between races, or stay abreast of the on-track action with plasma screen televisions, which display live telemetry from each race. The aim is for guests to have almost as much fun off of the track as they do on.\n\nThe real reason to visit K1 Speed, however, is the racing. Take everything you know about go-karts and throw it out the window–if you haven’t raced the high-performance electric karts at K1 Speed, you haven’t gone go-kart racing. The center is open seven days a week and you are invited to come in to K1 Speed Sacramento today.
