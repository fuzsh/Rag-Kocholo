K1 Speed is the largest multi-site operator of kart racing centers globally, with a footprint of more than 83 high-speed, all-electric karting centers, spanning 29 US states and six countries (as of January 2024). Headquartered in Irvine, California, K1 Speed has grown to become the premier brand for kart racing – for weekend family fun-seekers, racing enthusiasts, and group and corporate events alike – with more than 50,000 visitors per center each year.

In addition to providing an unmatched electric karting experience, K1’s centers offer Food & Beverage via its Paddock Lounge, arcade games, race gear and other accessories, local leagues and championships, and more. K1 Speed is growing rapidly, both within the US and internationally, in order to provide access to new karters and expand its racing ecosystem.

Verlinvest invested in summer 2023 to partner with Susan and David Danglard on further growing K1 Speed into a global experience destination.
