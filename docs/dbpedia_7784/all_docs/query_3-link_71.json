        "text": "Hayek’s opposition to the historical approach to political economy was unwavering over the course of his career. Drawing on Menger’s Untersuchungen über die Methoden der Sozialwissenschaften, Hayek regarded the Schmollers and Brentanos as foreign to true economics - a dangerous, but transitionary, hiccup in the progression of economic theory. In spite of Hayek’s antagonistic attitude, this article argues that certain elements of his stance after “Economics and Knowledge” (1936) were raised by historical political economists in the final decades of the nineteenth century. The point is not to suggest a direct influence of historical economists on Hayek, but one mediated by the geographical, linguistic, and cultural proximity of Austria and Germany. As documented in section one, plenty of evidence indicates that the Methodenstreit between Menger and Schmoller did not entail a sharp separation between the two camps. The paper focuses on the following facets of Hayek’s thought: his concern with realism; the acknowledgement of complexity; the willingness to address policy issues, drawing on a peculiar history of modern thought; his ambivalence about value judgements; his focus on institutions and social rules; and a view of evolution as regulated by group superiority. It is argued that, in contrast to Hayek who advocated “the primacy of the abstract”, Schmoller can be seen as an upholder of the primacy of the concrete. Looking at Hayek through German lenses has four advantages. First, it widens the historical context of his thought by questioning the supposed gulf between the Austrian and the German schools. Second, it shows that Hayek’s interpretation of the “younger historical school” was severely biased. Third, establishing a link between the historical economists and a now revered author like Hayek may shed a new and favourable light on a group still viewed with disdain. Fourth, there emerges an interpretation of Hayek’s thinking centred on value judgements.\n\nIf anything like a change in direction can be distinguished in the development of the work of Friedrich August von Hayek, it does not lie in his supposed abandoning of the idea of equilibrium (which is based on a mistaken interpretation of his work). It is rather the transition of a radically systematic approach to problems and the elaboration of their solution that is characterized by a high level of analytic sophistication to a more associative approach. Examples of the former are Hayek’s theory of mind and his monetary, business cycle and capital theories; his theory of evolution and social and political philosophy are examples of the latter. Hayek’s economics constitutes a research programme. One of the factors that influenced its further development was Sraffa’s criticism of Hayek’s Prices and Production. In reply to this, Hayek developed his highly sophisticated capital theory and his ideas on neutral money and the international monetary order. I intend to show that the development of Hayek’s economic research programme can only be understood if one takes into account his radically systematic and analytical approach. ADDED COMMENT The paper has “radical ECONOMIST” in the title because I wanted to point out to the audience of the Department of Economics of NYU that the almost generally accepted idea that Hayek’s theory of capital is fatally flawed is wrong. It is one of the (alas!) several red herrings that keep freely swimming in the sea of Hayek research. In the early 1930s Piero Sraffa critized Hayek’s Prices and Production. One of his criticisms was that Hayek had not taken account of the fact that every factor of production has its “own rate of interest.” Hayek took this criticism seriously and with the thoroughness that is characteristic of all his work in all of the various disciplines – at least up till the publication of The Sensory Order in 1952 - set out to solve the problem Sraffa had indicated. That led to a series of articles and eventually The Pure Theory of Capital, in which he had meticulously constructed a highly abstract theory takes into account each productive input's own rate of interest. Hayek showed how entrepreneurial decisions on investment process involve all these own rates. The paper shows that this type of radicalism characterizes the rest of Hayek’s work, too. This more than once became a case of the better being the enemy of the good: because Hayek did not succeed in solving the (often very difficult) problems he had put on his agenda at all, or not in time, he either decided not to publish his attempt to solve it (in the case of his reply to Popper’s criticism of The Sensory Order – see my paper on “How artificial is intelligence in AI?”) or it was too late for the scientific community to take notice (the case of Sraffa’s criticism)."
