        "text": "The misconception that costs determined prices prevented economists for a long time from recognizing that it was prices which operated as the indispensable signals telling producers what costs it was worth expending on the production of the various commodities and services, and not the other way around. It was the costs which they had expended which determined the prices of things produced.\n\nIt was this crucial insight which finally broke through and established itself about a hundred years ago through the so-called marginal revolution in economics.\n\nThe chief insight gained by modern economists is that the market is essentially an ordering mechanism, growing up without anybody wholly understanding it, that enables us to utilize widely dispersed information about the significance of circumstances of which we are mostly ignorant. However, the various planners (and not only the planners in the socialist camp) and dirigists have still not yet grasped this.\n\n\"Coping with Ignorance,\" The Ludwig von Mises Memorial Lecture, Originally published in Imprimis 7 (Hillsdale, Michigan: Hillsdale College, July 1978). Later reprinted in Cheryl A. Yurchis (ed.) Champions of Freedom (The Ludwig von Mises Lecture Series Vol. 5; Hillsdale, Michigan: Hillsdale College Press, 1979).\n\nIt seems to me more and more that the immense efforts which during the great popularity of macroeconomics over the last thirty or forty years have been devoted to it, were largely misspent, and that if we want to be useful in the future we shall have to be content to improve and spread the admittedly limited insights which microeconomics conveys.\n\nI believe it is only microeconomics which enables us to understand the crucial functions of the market process: that it enables us to make effective use of information about thousands of facts of which nobody can have full knowledge.\n\n\"Coping with Ignorance,\" The Ludwig von Mises Memorial Lecture, Originally published in Imprimis 7 (Hillsdale, Michigan: Hillsdale College, July 1978). Later reprinted in Cheryl A. Yurchis (ed.) Champions of Freedom (The Ludwig von Mises Lecture Series Vol. 5; Hillsdale, Michigan: Hillsdale College Press, 1979).\n\nThe basic problem is that there are three Hayeks:\n\nthe--absolutely brilliant--price-system-as-information-aggregator Hayek.\n\nthe--absolutely bonkers--business-cycle \"liquidationist\" Hayek.\n\nthe--absolutely wrong--social-democracy-is-evil Hayek.\n\nThe first was a genius. The second was a moron--his could never make his arguments cohere either conceptually or empirically, but he kept doubling down on them and wound up in infinite reputational bankruptcy. The third was wrong--I would say blinded ex ante by ideology, others would say proved wrong ex post by events.\n\nThe problem is that the modern-day Hayekians are by-and-large uninterested in the good Hayek (1), and interested only in the bad Hayeks (2) and (3)...\n\nJ.
