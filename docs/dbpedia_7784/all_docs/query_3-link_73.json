There can be some changes made in the list probably. The works from the list range from Economics to Political Science to Psychology (and Cognitive Neuroscience) to Jurisprudence to Philosophy of Science to Social Philosophy. Hayek can be claimed as the greatest polymath in last two centuries (or further). He's probably the greatest economist ever who went on to inspire several economists and Nobel Laureates like John Hicks, Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, Ronald Coase, Vernon L. Smith, Amartya Sen, Elinor Ostrom etc. and himself won Nobel Prize in 1974. An underrated but very essential figure of social science. Friedrich von August Hayek!\n\nToday we launch The Center's LinkedIn site with our first press release announcing the launch of a new book series (De Gruyter Series in Oligarchs and Oligarchies) with our friends and colleagues at De Gruyter Business & Economics De Gruyter Brill. Shortly, we will be sharing a multi-disciplinary Request for Proposals for this series. Stay tuned! We are also pleased to announce that we have signed a contract for the first book in that series: The Oligarchs of the Americas--The Journey Through Uncertainty. Our Executive Director Valentina Rodríguez is the lead author, and our Executive Chair David Lingelbach the second author. This book continues the intellectual journey that began with #oligarchsgrip with a deep dive into the Western Hemisphere--the world's most oligarch-intensive region over more than 500 years--and its #oligarchs. From conquistadores to tech bros, the oligarchs of the Americas have played a central role in shaping this phenomenon.

These books have left indelible marks not just on academia but beyond it. A few such books are as follows: 1. \"The General Theory of Relativity\" - Albert Einstein's groundbreaking work, published in 1915, revolutionized our understanding of gravity by providing a new framework for describing the gravitational force as the curvature of spacetime, leading to predictions such as the bending of light around massive objects and the existence of black holes. 2. \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" - This seminal work by John Maynard Keynes, published in 1936, revolutionized economic thought by challenging classical economic ideas and introducing the concepts of aggregate demand, effective demand, and the role of government intervention in managing economic downturns. 3. \"General Theory of Law and State\" - This seminal work by Hans Kelsen, first published in 1945, presents his influential theory of law, which emphasizes the hierarchical structure of legal systems and the primacy of basic norms as the foundation of legal validity. P.S- In the pic, Einstein, Keynes, and Kelsen respectively. #thoughts #history #books #ideas #physics #economics #law\n\nMy first book is officially out today! And it's FREE for anyone who'd like to read it here: https://lnkd.in/da3kheMx So please pass it on to anyone with an interest in the future of humanity (hopefully that's you too!) Physical copies are also available here: https://lnkd.in/dEw4NAJ3 And here's some nice words that very clever people have said about it: “A uniquely rich and thoughtful account of one of the most destructive ideologies of our time. This is a book for anyone who wants a clearsighted view of the current political moment.” Alice Crary, University of Oxford \"Erudite and thorough - the most rational discussion of Transhumanism to date. No less than a seminal intervention in the field.\" Jonathan Hay, University of Chester, University of Chester “Thomas does a brilliant job of criticizing transhumanist thought...This full-length book is incredibly well researched and a timely addition to the current discourse.” Richard Lewis, University of Washington Bothell \"This is a brilliant, timely, and important contribution...A must-read for anyone interested in the future of humanity and how this future could go terribly wrong.\" Émile P. Torres, Case Western Reserve University “At the edge of academic debates, an increasingly powerful position has developed: transhumanism. Thomas exposes its celebratory take on capitalism, data and technology, and its false solutions to contemporary dilemmas. A much-needed guide.” Nick Couldry, London School of Economics and Political Science\n\nI am delighted to announce that my research paper, \"BRIDGING THE GAP: INTEGRATING PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION INTO ECONOMIC POLICY\" has been accepted for presentation at the 4th International Conference on Contemporary Problems of Law & Economics. The conference, organized by the Center for American and European Studies in collaboration with various universities worldwide, will feature my presentation at 9:30 on 6th July. Paper Overview: My paper, delves into the fundamental concept of law in philosophical thought, drawing inspiration from the seminal works of Friedrich Hegel and Hayek. I contend that the shortcomings of macroeconomic policies in achieving market equilibrium stem from inherent loopholes, and that a paradigm shift towards micro-data-driven policies is essential. By analyzing a decade's worth of research data (2010-2020), I reveal a striking trend of economic research prioritizing macroeconomic models at the expense of micro-level dynamics, neglecting the very variables that hold the key to true market understanding and equilibrium. Through this research, I aim to bridge the gap between philosophical foundations and economic practice, offering a novel perspective on the intricate relationship between law, philosophy, and economics\n\nProfessionally mourning Nobel Prize winner Prof. Robert Solow... since Sunday morning, the day I found out about his passing, also the day I learned who he was. A month after the fact, from a two weeks old issue of \"The Economist\" (I was the last one at the breakfast table)... The \"0 to 60mph in less than 3 seconds\" standard of the industry had nothing on the sudden deceleration of my dreams. Now, explaining through rolling tears to the standbyer husband how my dreams could have been related (at all, leave alone on that level) to a person whose life The Economist unveiled to me in tandem with his passing proved challenging. It had to do with Prof. Solow clearly being the philosopher-king (as portrayed by The Economist: knife-sharp philosophical levels of knowledge, the Occam's razor type—\"he liked formal models and mathematics. But nothing too fancy\", no “over-refinement”), a double-edged sword with the practical edge sharp enough to cut through the web of political power. He is portrayed as a man whose pursuit of knowledge and social virtue was immune to the allure of personal gain and corruption (while serving in wwii “He declined to become an officer so that he would not have to boss anyone around,\" accepting a job at MIT but asking \"what the lowest-paid professor earned, and accepted the same\"). Uniquely able to apply his knowledge for the good of the state through the new Institute for Equitable Growth... that is literally the definition of the philosopher-king, isn't it? So here I am, midweek, still feeling bereft of \"my chance,\" which “chance” thoroughly amused the bystander. Because, with zero formal econ education, I cried my lost chance to pitch to this philosopher-king who, (in the said professional dreams) would have totally listened to my framework and mathematical formulae for swiftly modeling growth and wealth distribution through the layers of the socioeconomic stackup. But I know he would have because he always \"made time for students\" and had deep sympathy for the \"foreman on the factory floor\"—because he seemed to have truly valued practical insights from unexpected sources…it might have come to nothing, of course, but I could have at least thoroughly amused him. 🚗💨😢 #Solow, #TheEconomist, #WealthDistributionJourney\n\nDear colleagues, Abstracts are invited for an edited collection of scholarly papers that utilize the afterlife and death (in general) as hermeneutical tools to understand our world today. The volume discusses that, if philosophy (as a way of life) has always been a means to deal with death, then also death (and its places) can tell us quite a lot about philosophy and, more in general, our way of life. For example, authors and critical thinkers like Giorgio Agamben, Hannah Arendt, Pascal Bruckner, Albert Camus, David Graeber, Jean-Paul Sartre, Wolfgang Streeck, just to name a few, all have used the afterlife and death as a hermeneutical tool to read aspects of their/our time (e.g. internment camps, social cohabitation, labour market, capitalism, etc.). I have dedicated two volumes to this hermeneutical reflectiveness of death and the afterlife (Limbo Reapplied [2018] and The Mirror of Death [2024]), but so much more can and should be said about it. Besides new or alternate readings of the authors and phenomena mentioned above, topics like Climate Change, Growing Old/Up (adults/children), Immigration, Integration, Pandemics (COVID-19 and others), Rise of Substance Abuse, Social Cohesion, Victimization, Wokeism, etc., all seem open to a similar hermeneutical reading with all the consequences that this involves. As such, I invite serious philosophical thought on this hermeneutics; wherein a diversity of views, direction, methodologies, approaches, etc. are strongly encouraged. Papers can come from the fields of Philosophy (so-called ‘Continental’ and ‘Analytical’), Theology, and from Literature and are not limited historically (the sources from which a text takes its original inspiration can be ancient, medieval, or contemporary). Papers should be the length of a typical journal article or book chapter. Both Rowman & Littlefield Publishers and Lexington Books have expressed interest. - Submit abstracts of no more than 600 words to: kkpvanhoutte@gmail.com - Abstracts due: September 1, 2024 - Notification of accepted abstracts: October 1, 2024 - First drafts of article-length/book chapter-length papers due: May 1, 2025 (date is flexible) Thank you for your consideration. Kristof K.P. Vanhoutte"
