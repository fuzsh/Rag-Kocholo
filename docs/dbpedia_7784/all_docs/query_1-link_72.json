        "text": "It is a bit of a paradox that economists have neglected, and continue to neglect, the part of Hayek's work for which he was awarded the Nobel prize in economics and which is characterized by a high level of analytical rigour. The paper compares Hayek's economics with Keynes'. It is curious, to say the least, that after 80 years, current debates on how to extricate ourselves from the economic crisis hail directly from Keynes' and Hayek's different theories and visions on economics and economic policy. This comparison will lead to a discussion of the links between politicians and economists in general. Introduction A period in the history of economic thought that still determines much of contemporary thinking in economics is the 1930s. The fact that there were – and, after almost 90 years, still are – two profoundly different theoretical orientations may cast doubt on the progress economics has made.1 Another aspect that deserves attention is that these two different traditions are based on very different theories about what caused the economic crisis of 1929 and what are the remedies to overcome the recession that followed it. Today, we are still suffering from the consequences of a financial and economic crisis that is at least as serious as that of 1929. Ten years after it exploded, no one is sure whether we have succeeded in pulling the global economy out of this crisis and even less if we have taken the necessary precautions to prevent another one. Have not economists learned anything in the mean time? Have not policy makers learned anything in the mean time? These are some of the questions I intend to deal with in the conclusion.\n\nIf anything like a change in direction can be distinguished in the development of the work of Friedrich August von Hayek, it does not lie in his supposed abandoning of the idea of equilibrium (which is based on a mistaken interpretation of his work). It is rather the transition of a radically systematic approach to problems and the elaboration of their solution that is characterized by a high level of analytic sophistication to a more associative approach. Examples of the former are Hayek’s theory of mind and his monetary, business cycle and capital theories; his theory of evolution and social and political philosophy are examples of the latter. Hayek’s economics constitutes a research programme. One of the factors that influenced its further development was Sraffa’s criticism of Hayek’s Prices and Production. In reply to this, Hayek developed his highly sophisticated capital theory and his ideas on neutral money and the international monetary order. I intend to show that the development of Hayek’s economic research programme can only be understood if one takes into account his radically systematic and analytical approach. ADDED COMMENT The paper has “radical ECONOMIST” in the title because I wanted to point out to the audience of the Department of Economics of NYU that the almost generally accepted idea that Hayek’s theory of capital is fatally flawed is wrong. It is one of the (alas!) several red herrings that keep freely swimming in the sea of Hayek research. In the early 1930s Piero Sraffa critized Hayek’s Prices and Production. One of his criticisms was that Hayek had not taken account of the fact that every factor of production has its “own rate of interest.” Hayek took this criticism seriously and with the thoroughness that is characteristic of all his work in all of the various disciplines – at least up till the publication of The Sensory Order in 1952 - set out to solve the problem Sraffa had indicated. That led to a series of articles and eventually The Pure Theory of Capital, in which he had meticulously constructed a highly abstract theory takes into account each productive input's own rate of interest. Hayek showed how entrepreneurial decisions on investment process involve all these own rates. The paper shows that this type of radicalism characterizes the rest of Hayek’s work, too. This more than once became a case of the better being the enemy of the good: because Hayek did not succeed in solving the (often very difficult) problems he had put on his agenda at all, or not in time, he either decided not to publish his attempt to solve it (in the case of his reply to Popper’s criticism of The Sensory Order – see my paper on “How artificial is intelligence in AI?”) or it was too late for the scientific community to take notice (the case of Sraffa’s criticism)."
