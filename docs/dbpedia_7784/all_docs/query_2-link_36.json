Hayek was compiled near the end of 1982 by John Cody assisted by Nancy Ostrem. We gratefully acknowledge the helpful suggestions of Kurt R. Leube (Editor-in-chief of the International Carl Menger Library, Vienna), Prof. Albert H. Zlabinger of Jacksonville University (and co-editor with Kurt Leube of Philosophia Verlag), Prof. Paul Michelson of Huntington College, Paul Varnell of Chicago, and members of the Institute for Humane Studies staff, including Leonard P. Liggio, Walter Grinder, and John Blundell.\n\nWhile aiming to be the most comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date listing of Hayekian scholarship yet assembled, this bibliography–owing to the prolific and dispersed nature of the materials involved—must unavoidably contain errors, incomplete citations, and omissions. Among the omissions are a great many of Hayek's voluminous letters-to-editors, short notes or comments, interviews (including tape recordings, video-cassettes, and films), and book reviews. Such journals as the Schriften des Vereins für Sozialpolitik, Jährbucher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik, Zeitschrift für Volkswirtschaft und Sozialpolitik (after 1927 superseded by Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie), and Economica contain many items not listed in this edition of the bibliography. Many additional bibliographical items by or about Hayek came to our attention only after our typesetting deadline precluded further citations. To remedy our omissions and to emend our in-accuracies for a possible subsequent publication of an enlarged Hayek bibliography we welcome our readers’ comments and assistance.\n\nEarlier bibliographical orientations to Hayek's writings that proved helpful in creating the present Bibliography are:\n\nErich Streissler, Gottfried Haberler, Friedrich A. Lutz, and Fritz Machlup, eds. “Bibliography of the Writings of Friedrich A. von Hayek,” in Roads to Freedom: Essays in Honour of Friedrich A. von Hayek.

Adhering to the fourfold classification system of Hayek's writings laid out in the Streissler 1969 Roads to Freedom, Hayek “Bibliography,” Machlup devised an alphabetical and numerical identification code for easy reference to Hayek's books (B-), pamphlets (P-), edited or introduced books (E-), and articles in learned journals or collections of essays (A-).]\n\n———.

Leube, “Vorwort und Bibliographie zur Weiderauflage F. A. Hayek: Geldtheorie und Konjunkturtheorie.” Salzburg: (W. Neugebauer) Philosophia Verlag, 1976. [Hayek's Geldtheorie (1929) together with its English translation (1933) is an expanded version of the paper (A-7a) delivered at a meeting of the Verein für Sozialpolitik, held in Zurich, in September 1928 (See A-7a with annotations). Hayek cites earlier studies as the foundations for his Geldtheorie: A-2a, A-6, A-7a, A-9a, A-13. Hayek presents, from the Austrian School perspective, a critical assessment of rival theories on the cause of trade cycle. He argues that the cause of all significant trade cycle fluctuations are monetary interventions which distort relative price relationships.].\n\nB-2 Prices and Production.

The “Preface to the Second Edition” of Prices (1935) states how Hayek developed Austrian capital theory following the four lectures. These developments were contained in the 2nd edition and prepared for by A-11a, A-12, A-13, A-14, A-21, A-22, A-23, A-24a, as well as by the first German edition of Preise (1931), the English version (B-1), and A-9a.

The first chapter, “Profits, Interest and Investment” is new; the other chapters are revisions of A-37a, A-27a, A-26, A-19, A-21, A-14, A-9a. Hayek's essays defend the Austrian School's theory of the trade cycle. He argues that monetary interventions cause far-ranging economic distortions that bring about malinvestment and unemployment.]\n\nB-5 The Pure Theory of Capital.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, Phoenix Books, 1956 (see B-13, chapt. 15) and also 1976 paperback edition by University of Chicago Press and Routledge and Kegan Paul.\n\n[Hayek wrote The Road to Serfdom in his “spare time from 1940 to 1943” while he was engaged in pure economic theory. The central argument was first sketched in A-37b (1938) and expanded in P-2 (1939). Hayek's thesis is that social-political planning endangers both political and economic liberties of the individual.]\n\nB-7 Individualism and Economic Order.

London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1951/1969; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951/1969, 320 pp.\n\n[During the 1920s the Mill-Taylor correspondence became available for scholarly assessment of how much ideological influence Harriet Taylor exerted on the political, economic, and social ideas of her intimate friend and eventual husband, John Stuart Mill.

Hayek analyzes the intellectual origins of social planning and engineering. Topics covered include: scientism and the methodology of studying society, collectivism, historicism, non-spontaneous or rationalistic social planning, as well as the role of Saint-Simon, Comte, and Hegel in legitimizing scientistic sociology.]\n\nB-10 The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology.

Reprinted Chicago: University of Chicago Press, Phonenix Book paperback, 1963 (out of print). University of Chicago Press has reissued the paperback in a Midway Reprint, 1976, with the Heinrich Klüver Introduction.\n\n[Though published in 1952, the “whole principle” of The Sensory Order was conceived 30 years earlier by Hayek in a draft of a student paper composed around 1919–1920, while he was still uncertain whether to become a psychologist or an economist. Three decades later his concern about the logical character of social theory led him to reexamine favorably his youthful conclusions on certain topics of epistemology and theoretical psychology: concepts of mind, classification, and the ordering of our mental and sensory world. In his 1952 Preface Hayek acknowledges his indebtedness “particularly” to Ernst Mach and his analysis of perceptual organization.]\n\nB-11 The Political Ideal of the Rule of Law. Cairo: National Bank of Egypt, Fiftieth Anniversary Commemorative Lectures, 1955, 76 pp. [Publication of four lectures Hayek delivered at the invitation of the National Bank of Egypt.

Mohr/P. Siebeck], 1971. (Spain 1961, Italy 1971, China [Taipei] 1975). [Hayek composed the Preface of The Constitution of Liberty on his 60th birthday (May 8, 1959). He intended this survey of the ideals of freedom in Western civilization to commemorate the centenary of John Stuart Mill's On Liberty (1859). In “Acknowledgments and Notes” he describes the various preliminary drafts and versions he incorporated into this volume; also see B-11. Hayek stresses the working of the liberal, spontaneous order of society, which is too complex to be subjected to social planning and engineering.]\n\nB-13 Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1967/1969; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967/1969; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1967/1969; x, 356 pp. Reprinted in paperback New York: Simon and Schuster Clarion Book, 1969.\n\n[This volume of 25 essays contains reprints of articles and speeches by F.

London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1978; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978. [This volume of 20 essays supplements Hayek's earlier Studies (B-13) by reprinting in a more accessible form some of his earlier articles and unpublished lectures not reprinted in Studies.

Ranging over themes from philosophy, politics, economics, and the history of ideas, Hayek analyzes such topics as constructivism, the ‘atavism of social justice’, liberalism, the dangers of economic planning, and the ideas of Mandeville, Smith, and Keynes.
