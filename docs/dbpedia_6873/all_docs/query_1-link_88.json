        "text": "A study commissioned by Podcast Radio shows 81% of respondents would be very likely or somewhat likely to listen to a radio station that broadcasts curated podcasting content.\n\nThe appeal and listener likelihood based on a description of Podcast Radio was measured among a panel of 500 18-64-year-old podcast consumers in the United States via Coleman Insights’ Pod Predictor service.\n\nThe study revealed that the Podcast Radio concept has broad, positive appeal across U.S. podcast consumers in geographic regions across the country with 25% saying they “Love it” and 28% saying they “Like it a lot”.\n\nGerry Edwards, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Podcast Radio, said: “Podcast Radio can help radio effectively play offense to the rise of podcasts as an in-vehicle, in-home and mobile entertainment choice. This new data reinforces that strong, engaging, spoken word content continues to evolve in exciting ways to meet the needs of U.S. listeners. That can enable radio to remain competitive and provide an attractive alternative for radio stations and radio groups.”\n\nGary Krantz, Founder and CEO, KMG Networks, noted: “Podcast Radio’s curated, customized, and localized podcast programming on the radio presents a tremendous opportunity for the radio industry and podcasters. The Coleman Insights study reinforces what we are experiencing in the first U.S. markets to introduce Podcast Radio: Podcast Radio is an innovative and highly appealing new option for spoken-word radio programming in the U.S. – and an idea whose time has come.”\n\nAJ Lurie, Vice President/Market Manager, Beasley Media Group-Southwest Florida, a Podcast Radio affiliate, commented: “Listeners are enthusiastic about getting high engagement podcasting content on their local radio stations – and that presents a premium opportunity for advertisers. In just a short time airing the Podcast Radio format on our stations, we have already started selling local programming and we are excited to see continued revenues and growth.”\n\nLast month, Beasley Media Group partnered with Podcast Radio and KMG Networks to unveil the new podcast multiplatform radio format in four regions across the company. The format is now available to listeners via broadcast in multiple regions on Beasley stations, including:\n\n1. Detroit: Translator 93.5 FM and WCSX-94.7 HD2\n\n2. Tampa: 1010 WJBR-AM (formerly WHFS-AM), WRBQ-HD2 and Translators 92.1 and 103.1\n\n3. Charlotte: Translator 94.7 FM and WSOC-HD3\n\n4. Ft. Myers / Naples: Translators 96.5 FM, 101.5 FM & 105.1 FM and WXKB-HD2\n\nIn addition, fans of spoken word content are also able to stream Beasley’s first four custom Podcast Radio stations and discover new podcasts via the PodcastRadioUS.com website. Each region’s podcast content is supported with localized imaging, promos, and IDs.\n\nPodcast Radio programming features live “Podjocks”, including former KROQ-FM (Los Angeles) Personality and Legendary Radio Hall of Famer Gene “Bean” Baxter. The format showcases the very best produced and popular podcasts from the U.S. and around the world, including audio content from TedAudio (TedTalk), Wondery, Evergreen, Corus, and more.\n\nPodcast Radio is available as a 24/7 format or as programming “blocks” that can run throughout the week. It is available now to radio stations and groups on a network/barter basis via KMG Networks.\n\nAdLarge Media handles network advertising sales for Podcast Radio."
