        "text": "The Jet-Puffed Marshmallow maestros, have decided that the natural progression from making fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth marshmallows is… making shoes. Yeah, Shoes. Now, before you start hyperventilating with excitement, let me just clear up a few things… These shoes are NOT for eating. I know, I know, it’s a tough pill to swallow. Or not swallow, because again, shoes are not meant to be consumed. Sorry, doggies with a taste for leather, your dreams have been shattered.\n\nSo, what’s the deal with these shoe monstrosities? Well, gather ’round because it’s about to get weird. According to Food and Wine, Jet-Puffed, in all their marshmallow wisdom, decided it was high time to expand their empire beyond the realm of marshmallow bags with S’mores shoes. Yes, Shoes that resemble s’mores. These aren’t s’mores shaped shoes. These are puffy slip-ons that “embody the essence of a s’more.”\n\nJet-Puffed Stuff:\n\nImagine you’re strolling down the street, casually flaunting your footwear that’s basically a marshmallow that got a tad too cozy with the campfire. The tops of these slip-ons are the color of graham crackers, because nothing screams “I’ve got a major case of the munchies like graham cracker-colored shoes. In addition, they’ve joined forces with a shoe company named Kizik, which sounds like the name of an alien species from a B-grade sci-fi movie. These shoes are listed on Kizik’s site as “Toasted Marshmallow Mars Roamers.\n\nThey can be yours if you’re ready to part with some hard-earned cash, you can snag a pair of these delightful delicacies for the small price of $119. That’s right, just a mere $119 for shoes that tell the world, “I’m passionate about both foot fashion and sugar-based confections.” But remember, no matter how convincing they may look, these shoes are NOT edible. So please, for the love of all things stylish and savory, keep them away from your taste buds. Trust me, they’re sole-ly for fashion.”\n\nBarbie Inspired Fashion Is Trending In Florida\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
