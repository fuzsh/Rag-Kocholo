        "text": "No one ever likes to hear about a Lee County scam. Let’s face it. Scammers are the worst. My Aunt had one of these crooks get to her once. They claimed to be the police and that she needed to pay a fine… With a gift card. I know. Would actually fall for that? Unfortunately, yes she did. But you or someone you know doesn’t have too.\n\nAccording to NBC2, there’s a Lee County scam everyone should know about. The Lee County Sheriffs Office is warning people about scammers targeting the our community. These scammers are pretending to be deputies and pressuring people to hand over money for making deals or to have their court cases settled.\n\nIt’s important to know that the sheriff’s office would never ask for money in this way. If something seems suspicious, it probably is. Now, here’s another tip, they won’t ever ask you to pay for a fine or anything, for that matter, with a gift card! Please don’t fall for that kind of Lee County scam.\n\nLee County Scam Calls:\n\nIf you happen to come into contact with a Lee County scam, here’s what to do. If you receive a call, just hang up! Don’t engage with these evildoers. Instead, if you have questions, reach out to the clerk of courts or your own lawyer, for guidance. Save the gift cards for yourself! You deserve to go out and have some fun. Just be vigilant when it comes to scammers. They are everywhere.\n\nBut if you’ve already fallen victim to these scammers, don’t panic. Sure you may feel silly or maybe even stupid. Especially after you paid for a parking ticket with a $500 gift card to Applebee’s. Just remember that you can stop them from making someone else their victim by calling the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at 239 477 1000. Report what happened!\n\nTop Mistakes That Can Get You Hacked\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
