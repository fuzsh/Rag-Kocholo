        "text": "Here’s some sound shark attack advice from a florida man survived one himself… Don’t be scared. Huh? Yeah, right. Easier said than done. One time I was in Mexico on vacation, having a grand old time, when someone suggested that we go swimming with seals! Now, being the adventurous type, I’m all in. But once I was in the water, reality set in… I was wearing this black wetsuit, and guess what? I look like a seal. And sharks eat seals. So I was basically with a group of people in the ocean, dressed like shark snacks. What a genius idea that was, huh?\n\nAccording to WFLA, St. Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach just spilled the beans on a wild shark bite case. And some shark attack advice from 24-year-old Marlin Wakeman. He’s a dude from Stuart, Florida. He had a gnarly encounter with not one, but two sharks. So, Wakeman was doing his thing on a boat fishing, while in the Bahamas, when he took an unplanned dip in the ocean. Suddenly, a Caribbean reef shark decided to take a nibble on his leg and kneecap!\n\nWakeman’s first reaction? “Oh s**t, I’m going to get bit by a shark.” Classic. But then another shark tried to take a chunk out of his shoulder! But luckily, it missed the mark. After the close encounter of the shark kind, Wakeman hauled himself back onto the boat, where the crew patched him up as best they could before rushing him to a nearby clinic. The pain knocked him out cold.\n\nShark Attack Advice:\n\nNow, when asked for some shark attack advice on dealing with shark run-ins, Wakeman dropped some wisdom. His motto? “Don’t be scared.” Sounds easy enough, right? Just remember, these sharks are top dogs in the ocean, so steer clear of their turf if you don’t want to be lunch. You know, like getting dressed up like a seal at feeding time. Probably isn’t the best of ideas.\n\nBut hey, it’s not all bad. St. Mary’s Medical Center says that Wakeman’s already out of the hospital and just has a follow-up appointment on the horizon. He made the escape and lived to tell the tale! So, his shark attack advice can’t be all that bad. Right? Next time you’re out on the water, keep Wakeman’s story in mind, and maybe invest in a utility belt with some shark repellent. Hey, it worked for Batman.\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
