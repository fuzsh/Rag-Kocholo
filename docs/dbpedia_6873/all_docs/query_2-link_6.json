        "text": "The Most Annoying Things About The Super Bowl are back.\n\nThe Super Bowl: the grandest stage in American sports, where the nation comes together to witness the biggest showdown in football. Or so they say. But let’s not sugarcoat it. According to Sports Illustrated, there are a few things about the Super Bowl that can drive even the most dedicated football fan up the wall.\n\nFirst on the list is the insufferable people who don’t watch football asking you who’s going to win the game. It’s like asking a fish to predict the weather – it’s just not their area of expertise. If you’re going to pester someone for their Super Bowl predictions, at least have a basic understanding of the teams in the game. Otherwise, it’s like trying to have a conversation about string theory with a toaster.\n\nSecond, we have the notorious “Big Game” debacle. Every year, the NFL restricts the use of its “Super Bowl” trademark, forcing us to call it the “Big Game.” It’s like calling a diamond a piece of carbon – technically correct but severely underwhelming.\n\nThird, the commercial spoilers. Gone are the days of eagerly waiting to see the new commercials during the game. Now, they’re all released on the internet ahead of time, ruining the anticipation and excitement. It’s like getting a sneak peek at your birthday presents a month before the big day.\n\nAnnoying Super Bowl:\n\nLast but not least, the Madden simulation. Every year, the EA video game “Madden” predicts the winner of the Super Bowl. And for some inexplicable reason, media outlets cover these predictions as if they carry any weight. The accuracy of these simulations is about as reliable as a flipped coin – in the past five Super Bowls, the Madden simulation has only been correct once.\n\nThe Super Bowl may be one of the biggest events of the year, but it’s not without its irritations. From football n00bs asking you who’s going to win to having to call it the “Big Game,” these annoyances are just a small price to pay for the excitement and thrill of the game. So, kick back, grab some nachos, and enjoy the Super Bowl…or the “Big Game” as the NFL would have it.\n\nThese Are The Richest NFL Players\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
