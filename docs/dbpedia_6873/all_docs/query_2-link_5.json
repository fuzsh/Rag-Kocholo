        "text": "So, you think your Southwest Florida backyard is a perfect oasis, huh? Think again. I just learned about a nightmare, called the New Guinea flatworm. They’re an invasive species that’s already taken over South Florida. According to WPTV, they’re found in almost every backyard! These guys are ready for a full on invasion of the entire state too. Yikes, and just like that… A new fear for 2024 has been unlocked.\n\nThese aren’t your garden variety pests. They’re coated in a toxin, but that’s not the main issue. The real danger is the parasite they carry. Ya know, these little critters called rat lungworms. They can carry a potentially deadly form of meningitis that affects animals and humans alike. Worms with worms. Awesome.\n\nOkay, now I feel like inspecting my own Cape Coral backyard. I always thought it was just me, my family and the dogs back here enjoying the Florida outdoors. Little did I know, those creepy New Guinea flatworms might be crashing our barbecue. The idea of these things in the dirt, especially with my dogs sniffing around, really bothers me. What if the dogs eat one? Oh, god. What if I eat one? Now I’m on high alert.\n\nFlorida’s New Nightmare:\n\nWhat’s worse? They’re practically indestructible! Getting rid of New Guinea flatworms may sound like a tough mission, but it’s not impossible. First and foremost, grab a pair of gloves because these worms have an evil superpower. Can you say allergy-inducing toxin? I feel itchy just thinking about it.\n\nThe best method, for now, is to pour boiling hot water on them. Sounds cruel, but it’s one of the most effective for killing them. Experts say to be persistent and check your garden regularly. Just when I thought things were looking up in 2024, now I got my face in the dirt looking for parasite-loaded creepy crawlers. Fun.\n\nThe Giant African Snail And 12 Other Animals That Are Trying To Destroy Florida\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
