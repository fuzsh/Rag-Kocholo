        "text": "Beasley Media Group is trying a twist on podcasting by launching a radio format called Podcast Radio U.S. in four markets.\n\nIt describes this as a “podcast multiplatform radio format” that will be heard via broadcast on stations in Detroit, Tampa, Charlotte and Ft. Myers/Naples. (The signals are listed at the end of this story.) The content can also be streamed via the website PodcastRadioUS.com.\n\nThe format was conceived by Podcast Radio in the United Kingdom, which describes it as a “speech format adapting podcast content into a radio-friendly listening experience.” Podcast Radio says the format uses “the familiarity and trust people have in radio” to help listeners discover and choose podcasts.\n\nBeasley said the stations and digital channels are branded as Podcast Radio Carolinas, Podcast Radio Southwest Florida, Podcast Radio Detroit and Podcast Radio Tampa Bay. “Each region’s podcast content will be supported with localized imaging, promos and IDs.”\n\nThe format will be offered to other radio stations and groups on a network/barter basis via KMG Networks. AdLarge Media is handling network advertising sales.\n\nBeasley Media Group Chief Content Officer Justin Chase said in the release, “Podcast Radio is an idea that Caroline Beasley and our team have been thinking about and researching for years and we’re excited to be the first to launch this format in the United States.”\n\nThe format features “podjocks” and showcases “produced and popular podcasts from the United States and all over the world, including audio content from TedAudio (TedTalk), Wondery, Evergreen, Corus and more.”\n\nThe Beasley signals that will carry it are a 93.5 FM translator in Detroit and its source station WCSX-94.7 HD2; Tampa’s 1010 WJBR(AM) (formerly WHFS); a 94.7 FM translator in Charlotte and its source WSOC-HD3; and Ft. Myers/Naples’ 96.5 FM/101.5 FM and WXKB-HD2."
