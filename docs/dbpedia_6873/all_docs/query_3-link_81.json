        "text": "Beasley Media Group is headquartered in Southwest Florida, and its stations serving the region stretching from Fort Myers south to Marco Island has just made a flurry of staff promotions.\n\nThis includes the naming of a new Program Director at “96 K-Rock,” the venerable personality-based station.\n\nTaking the PD role at WRXK-FM in the Fort Myers-Naples market is Jeff Zito.\n\nZito has been involved in Southwest Florida radio for more than two decades. Today, he works for Beasley in Tampa-St. Petersburg as Asst. PD and an on-air personality at its WPBB-FM 98.7. He’ll telecommute from Tampa, and make the trek south on Interstate 75 as needed.\n\nOn site in Southwest Florida to assist Zito as Programming Coordinator is WRXK midday host Marija Puidak. She was the morning host at the former crosstown WXNX-FM “93X,” now a Country station. She’s been a weekend host on 96 K-Rock since November 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Beasley names Babs the new midday host for its Top 40 WXKB “B103.9,” and will continue hosting middays for WLLD-FM in Tampa, where she will be based. It is assumed the WXKB shift will be voicetracked."
