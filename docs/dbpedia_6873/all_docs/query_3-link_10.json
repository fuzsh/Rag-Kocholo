It was owned by Multiculutral Brodcasting Plotagon, a joint venture between the Los Angeles Times and Plotagon Broadcasting Network (which also owned future station WKBA-TV). Kelly Broadcasting purchased the station in 1981, resulting in the station dropping its multicultural programming and switching to a general independent station featuring cartoons, films, and syndicated shows.\n\n1983-1991[]\n\nThis logo was based off of then-Kelly Broadcasting sister station KCPQ's (Seattle, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) logo, although with a different font. In 1983, WKSP-TV dropped its old logo and switched to Q18 branding to align the station's branding with KCPQ in Seattle. On October 9, 1986, WKSP-TV became a charter affiliate of Fox, although the affiliation was only temporary until WYAK-TV (channel 14, now an NBC affiliate) took over the Fox affiliation in April 1987, resulting in the station becoming independent again.\n\n1991-1995[]\n\nWXKB-TV[]\n\n1995-2006[]\n\n1995[]\n\nKelly sold WKSP-TV to Hearst Broadcasting on November 18, 1994, with the station changing its callsign to WXKB-TV after the sale was finalized on January 5, 1995.\n\n1995-2000[]\n\nOn January 16, 1995, WXKB-TV returned its network affiliate status when the station joined UPN as its charter affiliate. In August 1997, Argyle Television Holdings II (which had purchased Northstar Television Group, parent company of WKBA-TV, in 1994) merged with the Hearst Corporation's broadcasting unit to form what was then known as Hearst-Argyle Television (now Hearst Television after the Hearst Corporation became sole owner of the group in mid-2009). Hearst-Argyle could not keep both WXKB-TV and WKBA-TV because duopolies were still prohibited by the FCC at that time, so they traded WXKB-TV to the Oakland-based Eggel Media Company, but continued to operate WXKB-TV through a local marketing agreement as KMBC-TV had done when it took over KCWB (now KCWE, a fellow CW affiliate in Kansas City) through LMA. The sale was completed on September 3, 1998, two months after the completion of the sale of several other Hearst-Argyle stations to Sunrise Television.\n\n2000-2006[]\n\n2000-2002[]\n\nIn May 2001, Hearst-Argyle bought back WXKB-TV outright from Eggel Media Company, creating Plotagon City's first television duopoly with WKBA-TV, after the FCC had begun allowing duopolies nearly two years earlier.\n\n2002-2006[]\n\n2006-2009; 2021-2024[]\n\nIn 2006, when UPN and The WB merged to form The CW, WXKB-TV became its charter affiliate and incorporated the network's name into its branding. In March 2021, when WXKB-TV began using The CW's standard graphics package used by most of its affiliates, the station returned to its CW 18 moniker since 2006.\n\n2009-2016; 2018-2021[]\n\nIn 2009, WXKB-TV adopted the Plotagon CW branding, as the station has been carried widely on various channel positions through most cable providers in the Plotagon area. When the station returned to this old branding in 2018, the station still used The CW's old graphics package from 2018 until the station switched to The CW's current graphics package from 2021 and returned to the CW 18 moniker.\n\n2016-2018[]\n\nIn 2016, WXKB-TV dropped the Plotagon CW branding and began adopting PLT 18 CW, possibly to follow the concept of WVTV in Milwaukee returning its old Super 18 moniker. This new branding only lasted two years, before WXKB-TV reverted to its old Plotagon CW branding in early 2018.\n\n2024-present[]"
