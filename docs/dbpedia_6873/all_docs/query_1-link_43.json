It is owned by Hearst Television alongside CW affiliate, WXKB-TV. The two stations share studios at the Plotagonia Square Stadium on Main Street in downtown Plotagon City. The station's transmitter is located between the border of downtown and North Plotagon City.\n\nIt is the market's oldest television station, making its debut in 1947.\n\nWPEK-TV[]\n\n1947-1953[]\n\nChannel 10 first signed on the air WPEK-TV on October 5, 1947 as the first television station in Plotagon City. It was owned by the Peak Family Institute owned by the family of David Peak, which also owns WPEK-AM (880 AM) and WPEK-FM (91.5 FM). It affiliated all the major networks of that time (CBS, NBC, ABC, and DuMont), but was a major affiliate of ABC, since its AM sister station was a strong affiliate of the ABC Radio Network. It eventually became a full-time ABC affiliate by 1952.\n\n1953-1956[]\n\n1956-1969[]\n\nWKBA-TV[]\n\n1969-1978[]\n\nIn 1969, as part of the institute attempted to focus more on their radio stations, WPEK-TV was sold to Plotagon Broadcasting Network, but because the FCC didn't allow stations in the same market but have different ownership to have the same call-letters, WPEK-TV's call-letters were changed to WKBA-TV. This logo made the debut of the station of the station's long used circle 10 logo.\n\n1978-1994[]\n\n1978-1986[]\n\nThe \"Circle 10\" was modified. It was now similar to the 1979â€“1993 logo of WILX-TV in Lansing, Michigan.\n\n1986-1994[]\n\nIn 1991, Northstar Television Group would acquire the operations of WKBA-TV under an LMA deal with Plotagon Broadcasting Network.\n\n1994-2020[]\n\nDespite not being owned by the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company (or \"Group W\"); the logo used here and continuing until 2020 would use a \"10\".\n\n1994-1996[]\n\nNorthstar Television was bought out by Argyle Television Holdings II, a company which was formed in late 1994 by a group of managers and executives who left the first incarnation of Argyle Television (the former Times-Mirror Broadcasting) after that company sold all of its stations to New World Communications, in January 1995.\n\n1994-1996 (secondary), 1996-1999 (primary)[]\n\nOn July 18, 1996, as part of Allbritton Communications' affiliation deal with ABC, The company's CBS affiliate (WPC-TV, channel 4) would become an ABC affiliate with CBS programming moving to UWN's longtime affiliate (WIER-TV, channel 8). WKBA-TV would become an affiliate of UWN the same day.\n\nIn August 1997, Argyle merged with the Hearst Corporation's broadcasting unit to form what was then known as Hearst-Argyle Television (now Hearst Television after the Hearst Corporation became sole owner of the group in mid-2009).\n\n1999-2006[]\n\n2006-2013[]\n\nIn 2009, Plotagon Broadcasting Network was acquired by Hearst Television, giving Hearst full control of the station.\n\n2013-2018[]\n\n2018-2020[]\n\n2020-present[]\n\nV â€¢ T â€¢ E Television stations in Plotagon City WPPB (PBS) (Channel 2) | WGUS-TV (GTN) (Channel 3) | WPC-TV (ABC) (Channel 4) | | WPC-DT5 | WDPF-TV/DT (ABN) (Channel 5) | WPOW-TV (CEN) (Channel 6) | WKPL (FOX) (Channel 7) | WKPL-DT2 (LTV) (Channel 7.2) | WKPL-DT3 (Inanimate World) (Channel 7.3) | WKPL-DT4 (Antenna TV) (Channel 7.4) | WIER-TV (CBS) (Channel 8) | MeTV (Channel 8.2) | WFDA-DT (Ion) (Channel 9) | Plotagon Channel HD (Channel 9.2) | Plotagon Movie Channel (Channel 9.3) | WKBA-TV (UWN) (Channel 10) | WKLA-TV ((Channel 11) | WPLT-TV (Channel 12) | WUIO-TV (RKO) (Channel 13) | WYAK-TV (NBC) (Channel 14) | WPFJ-TV (Channel 15) (EBN) | WYKA-TV (MBS) (Channel 16) | | WVN-TV (Now Defunct) (Channel 17) | WXKB-TV (The CW) (Channel 18) | WKWN-TV (MyTV) (Channel 20) | WPAR-TV (Tel) (Channel 23) | WWQW-TV (Channel 28) | WIIT-TV (Channel 41) | WMPC-TV (Mayamision) (Channel 43) | WQCC-TV (Channel 48) | POI-DT (RCT) (Channel 50) | WASK-TV (UniMAS) (Channel 55) | WFPO-TV (Uni) (Channel 59) | WPIU-TV (Channel 62) | Plotagon Public Access (Channel 63) | WJEW-TV (Channel 66) | {{{footer}}}"
