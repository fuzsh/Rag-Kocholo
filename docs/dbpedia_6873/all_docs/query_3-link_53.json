        "text": "Living in Southwest Florida, we have a lot of famous people that live here, but you’re most likely to spot a celebrity in 1 Florida city.\n\nIt wasn’t all that long ago that I was talking to a friend to casually mentioned that he had done work on Cliff Williams’ house in Fort Myers. That’s Cliff Williams of AC/DC. Knowing that I’m a fan of all things rock and roll, I said “How could you not have told me before?!” His response: “I work on a lot of famous people’s houses around town.” Which got me thinking about all the celebrities that live around here, especially in Naples, there are a lot! But there’s one Florida city where the likelihood to spot one is even higher.\n\n1 Florida City You’re Most Likely To Spot A Celebrity\n\nWhen you think of cities like New York and Los Angeles, celebrities are everywhere. With that also comes the paparazzi, so celebs can rarely go unnoticed when there are cameras following them everywhere. But other cities like Chicago and Miami, they seem to be left alone a little bit more. Speaking of Miami, South Florida is home to a lot of celebrities from Pitbull to Jeff Bezos to new resident Sydney Sweeney. There’s high end real estate, beautiful beaches, year-round warm weather and a great nightlife scene. What more do they need?\n\nBut it’s not even in Miami that you’re most likely to see a celebrity. However, the city that you are, IS on the east coast of Florida. BetUS did a recent study looking at celebrity sightings from January to May of this year and where they took place. Coming in at #10 in the world is Palm Beach, FL. In the U.S., Palm Beach got the #7 spot.\n\nWho might you see there? While she doesn’t live there, Martha Stewart has been known to frequent restaurant Le Bilboquet. Other celebrities you may spy in Palm Beach include Sylvester Stallone, Tommy Hilfiger, Dr. Oz, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi, Rod Stewart and more.\n\nTo see the full list of cities you’re most likely to spot a celebrity, click here\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
