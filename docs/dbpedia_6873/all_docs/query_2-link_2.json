        "text": "Florida Man Weaponizes a Seasoned Chicken Sandwich in Fast Food Feud\n\nWhat is it with all the fast food abuse lately? If it’s not a poisoned meatball sub, then it’s a weaponized spicy chicken sandwich. I wouldn’t want to run into this food warrior at my favorite Wawa in Fort Myers. This guy would rather his food in your eye, than his own mouth! Meet Florida man Daniel Palomino III, a 32-year-old purist of perfectly cooked poultry.\n\nAccording to FOX35, In the early hours of the morning, at a Wawa in St. Petersburg, Palomino places an order for some chicken. However, when the sandwich arrives, it’s not the culinary masterpiece he had hoped for. The chicken, in Palomino’s eyes, falls short of the mark… It’s not cooked to perfection.\n\nNow, most of us would probably settle for a being a little disgruntled or maybe muster the courage to ask for a refund. But not Palomino. He’s on a mission. He confronts a Wawa worker about the chicken injustice and allegedly takes it up a notch by tossing a piece at them. Oh, did I mention that this airborne chicken chunk was smothered in Nashville hot seasoning? Ouch, right in the poor worker’s eye.\n\nLaunching undercooked, spice-covered chicken as a form of protest might be a tad extreme, but surprise, surprise… Palomino was allegedly under the influence. After a brief time behind bars and $500 bucks later, he’s back on the streets. Hopefully a little wiser. Let’s face it, late-night munchies are sometimes necessary. But assaulting the people who make your food is not how to have it your way. Maybe next time, Palomino will order his food well done. Much safer for everyone involved.\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039. Budman likes to write about funny news, a good Florida man story, stupid criminals or anything involving a superhero. Budman, a comic book and pop culture enthusiast, even named his daughter Kara Zor-El, after Supergirl. His only child is his true passion beyond the mic. Being a dad is his favorite role. Budman, a true family man, balances his love for radio with quality time spent with loved ones and his trusty dogs."
