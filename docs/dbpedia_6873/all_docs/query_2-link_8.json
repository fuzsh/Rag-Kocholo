        "text": "It’s a timeless debate. Right up there with “is a hot dog a sandwich?” There may be no definitive answer, but it’s always worth discussing. Who has the best fries in all of fast food?\n\nEveryone is entitled to their own option and taste (literally). However, let’s be honest, there can only be one winner. There’s only allowed to be one winner, and one fry declared the best above all the rest. One fry to rule them all.\n\nEvery Day Is Fry Day\n\nWhen talking about the best fries in fast food, there are no shortage of options. That’s for sure. You’ve got your national big brands. Then you’ve got your local specialties. Then, there’s also the regional restaurants that aren’t in every state, but aren’t strictly in one city, either. We’re taking everything into consideration.\n\nOf course, ranking the best fries in fast food is no easy task. Much like a snowflake, every list is certain to be different. I mean, they’re all on the menu for a reason. If they didn’t taste good they’d be long gone. It’s the same thing with professional sports. Even the worst player on the team is still incredible when you think about it.\n\nI’m no stranger to fast food, the cashier at my local establishment recognizes me when I pull up in the drive-thru. It’s a blessing and a curse, I suppose. So, with that type of experience and dedication I think my list can be deemed credible and valid.\n\nWhat To Look For In A Fry\n\nPersonally, I love a good crunch. A well-done fry is a fry well-done. I’m not big on wet fries or greasy soft fries. They’ve also got to be independently great. If you need ketchup or ranch in order to enjoy the fries then they must not be that great!\n\nConsistency is key, as well. It can’t be one of those “oh one time I had them and they were fantastic, but ever since they aren’t great.” No one hit wonders here. The best fry in fast food has to be something you can depend on. It’s reliable and every time you drive-thru you know what you’re getting.\n\nLet’s not delay. Here are my rankings of the best fries in fast food. You may agree with some, you may hate some of these picks. That’s totally up to you. I will say, some big names are off the list, and likely for a reason.\n\nThe 7 Best Fries In Fast Food"
