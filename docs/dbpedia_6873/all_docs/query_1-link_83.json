        "text": "Beasley Media Group is partnering with Podcast Radio and KMG Networks for a new “podcast multiplatform radio format in four regions across the company.” Beasley says this unique format will be available to listeners via broadcast on WCSX-HD2/W228CJ, Detroit “Podcast Radio Detroit”; WJBR-AM, Tampa (formerly WHFS-AM) “Podcast Radio Tampa Bay”; WSOC-HD3/W234BY, Charlotte “Podcast Radio Carolinas”; and WXKB-HD2/W243BM, Fort Myers & W268AH/W286AK, Naples, Florida “Podcast Radio Southwest Florida.” The stations can also be streamed and consumed as podcasts via PodcastRadioUS.com. Podcast Radio states, “Podcast Radio features live ‘Podjocks’, including former KROQ-FM, Los Angeles personality and legendary Radio Hall of Famer Gene ‘Bean’ Baxter. The format will showcase the very best produced and popular podcasts from the United States and all over the world, including audio content from TedAudio (TedTalk), Wondery, Evergreen, Corus, and more! The initiative with Beasley is the first of its kind for the company in the United States. The format will be offered to radio stations and groups on a network/barter basis via KMG Networks. AdLarge Media has been selected to facilitate the network advertising sales.” Beasley Media Group chief content officer Justin Chase says, “Podcast Radio is an idea that Caroline Beasley and our team have been thinking about and researching for years and we’re excited to be the first to launch this format in the United States. This concept has been highly successful for Gerry [Edwards] and his team in the United Kingdom, and we believe our audience will fall in love with the Podcast Radio U.S. version we present on our stations.”"
