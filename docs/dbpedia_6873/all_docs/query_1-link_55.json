Myers / Naples: 96.5 FM/101.5 FM & 105.1 FM and WXKB-HD2\n\nContent can also be streamed from the first four custom stations via the PodcastRadioUS.com website.\n\nThe stations and digital channels will be branded as Podcast Radio Carolinas, Podcast Radio Southwest Florida, Podcast Radio Detroit and Podcast Radio Tampa Bay. Each region’s podcast content will be supported with localised imaging, promos, and ID’s.\n\nPodcast Radio features live “Podjocks”, including former KROQ-FM (Los Angeles) personality and Radio Hall famer Gene “Bean” Baxter. The format will showcase the best produced and popular podcasts from the United States and all over the world, including audio content from TedAudio (TedTalk), Wondery, Evergreen, Corus, and more.\n\nThe initiative with Beasley is the first of its kind for the company in the United States. The format will be offered to radio stations and groups on a network/barter basis via KMG Networks. AdLarge Media has been selected to facilitate the network advertising sales.\n\n“Podcast Radio is an idea that Caroline Beasley and our team have been thinking about and researching for years and we’re excited to be the first to launch this format in the United States,” said Beasley Media Group Chief Content Officer Justin Chase. “This concept has been highly successful for Gerry and his team in the United Kingdom, and we believe our audience will fall in love with the Podcast Radio U.S. version we present on our stations.”\n\n“We are beyond excited to be working with Beasley as a forward-thinking and innovative company,” said Gerry Edwards, Founder & CEO of Podcast Radio. “Caroline, the team, and Beasley’s great station brands will make fantastic first movers into the Podcast Radio format as they embrace this unique new radio content as a leader in both broadcast and digital.”\n\n“KMG and Podcast Radio is excited to partner with Beasley Media Group to be the first to bring this proven and innovative idea to the U.S,” said Gary Krantz, Founder & CEO of KMG/KMG Networks. “When we evaluated the business opportunity in America, it was their forward-looking team that shared our vision immediately and stepped up to work collaboratively to execute this across key regions within the Beasley Media Group platform.”\n\n“This collaboration underscores AdLarge’s commitment to delivering exceptional advertising solutions to our clients,” commented Cathy Csukas, AdLarge CEO. “We are poised to unlock new opportunities for advertisers, enabling them to reach their target audiences through premium content.”"
