        "text": "CAPE CORAL, Fla. — A once-in-a-lifetime local radio sweepstakes helped a Cape Coral couple start their own family.\n\nBack in 2017, WXKB in Fort Myers. Florida held a \"Win a Baby\" contest in which the winner received a round of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments and required medication.\n\nNow, Krista and Anthony Rivera can call themselves parents. Just a few years ago, it was something they couldn't imagine.\n\n\"Out of nowhere, we got the news that I was diagnosed with testicular cancer,\" Anthony Rivera said.\n\n\"When we thought we couldn't have a baby, it was crushing,\" Krista Rivera said.\n\nTheir only option was IVF treatment, but it's expensive. Then, they won the 'Win a Baby' contest.\n\n\"Without the contest, we definitely would not have been able to have our dream of having a baby,\" Krista Rivera said.\n\nThe couples' baby boy, Garrett, is now three months old, and they are forever grateful for the little guy.\n\n\"I never ever would have thought that three years later, I would be holding my baby boy,\" Anthony Rivera said.\n\n\"This is really a dream come true. we never thought we'd have our miracle, and we're so happy to have our little family,\" Krista Rivera said.\n\nThey said Garrett is truly a miracle because the IVF process isn't easy. One in eight couples has trouble getting pregnant through IVF.\n\nThey want to inspire other couples who are struggling to get pregnant, never to give up hope.\n\n\"It's so worth it, so keep fighting. I know it's hard; it's never easy. But it's worth it,\" Krista Rivera said.\n\nWXKB held the \"Win a Baby\" contest again in 2019. This year's winners, Vy and Chris Nguyen, said they are going through the infertility process right now and hope to start their own family soon."
