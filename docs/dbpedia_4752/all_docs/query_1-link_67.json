        "text": "Bee-Line's Summer Vacation on fares is back - enjoy free rides on all buses from July 1 - September 2, 2024 (Valid on all routes including ParaTransit). See our flyers in English and Spanish.\n\nInformation about the Bee-Line system is available in alternative accessible formats on request.\n\nOver 65 percent of all Westchester County residents are within walking distance of a Bee-Line bus route, making the bus both close and convenient.\n\nRiding public transit is a great travel choice. It helps our environment by reducing air pollution and traffic congestion. It's also a bargain. Transit fares are competitive with the out-of-pocket costs of driving, especially if you pay for parking. We deal with the traffic hassles for you, and you get time to read, relax, socialize, plan your day or even your next vacation."
