Weekend shuttle service begins Saturday, Aug. 17.\n\nASU intercampus shuttles transport students, faculty and staff between the Downtown Phoenix, Polytechnic, Tempe and West Valley campuses. Shuttles do not operate on university-observed holidays.\n\nShuttle commuters should plan ahead to allow for sufficient time when traveling on the intercampus shuttles. Multiple shuttles may be in service at peak times, but exact times are not guaranteed due to potential traffic delays. Riders can use the shuttle tracker for live updates on where shuttles travel.\n\nPlease minimize talking and other noises while riding the shuttles for the driver's safety and the comfort of all passengers. If you do have a conversation, please speak quietly. Thank you.\n\nTrack your shuttle\n\nFollow @asu2asuShuttles on the social platform X for route updates. We want to hear from our customers. Tell us how we're doing.\n\nShuttle features\n\nArrow Stage Lines is ASU’s intercampus shuttle provider. To access the Wi-Fi:\n\nSelect \"ASU_Arrow Wifi\" network.\n\nClick \"Agree.\"\n\nConnection should begin immediately.\n\nShuttles also feature bike racks, overhead luggage storage, reclining seats, underground storage and USB charging ports.\n\nLost and found\n\nIf you left an item on the shuttle, return to the same shuttle stop two hours after disembarking. Since the shuttle is on a specific route, it will return to the same stop once every two hours. Ask the driver if any items were turned in or if you can check to see if it is still there.\n\nThe driver delivers lost items to the shuttle bus company’s dispatch office at the end of the day. If you cannot check the shuttle, call Arrow Stage Lines for locating assistance.\n\nAfter 30 days from delivery, unclaimed items will be donated. ASU PTS and Arrow Stage Lines are not responsible for any lost or stolen items."
