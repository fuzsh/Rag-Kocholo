        "text": "A GREAT COMPANY WITH PROFESSIONAL STAFF\n\nI’ve been on a few trips with SBA over the years, and they’ve all been worth the money – terrific staff, great trips, clean, comfortable transportation. I’m a retired woman with a small income, so these are always “once in a while” trips. We used to drive to LA for Dodgers games, but SBA is worth the money. The seats in the park are great – second tier above home plate; unless you have season tickets, you can’t do better (and you may not even do that well!). The trips to places like Hearst Castle are great, too (I had a REALLY fun time on that trip). We used to drive to Dodger Stadium, but no more! Now when we drive back to Santa Barbara after a game, we’re always rested and happy, and we had a GREAT time! SBA asked me what I think about them; as you can see, I think they walk on water and don’t leave tracks!\n\nBy the way, if you’re not an old fogey like I am, but are considering a SBA trip, I guarantee you’ll enjoy whatever trip you’ll take. We’re all folks who’re traveling with SBA because we want to have a good time!"
