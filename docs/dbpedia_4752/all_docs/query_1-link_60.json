The shuttle operates Monday through Friday, except on federal holidays, from 6:45 am to 6:15 pm.\n\nVisitors using Metro can meet the NIST shuttle at Bus Bay C (the fourth bay on the row) on the east side of the Shady Grove Metro Station. If you are facing the front of the train, the east side is on your right, and is the side with the parking garages. The shuttle picks up at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour. The last NIST shuttle leaves Shady Grove Metro at 6:15 pm.\n\nThe shuttle departs from the front of the NIST Administration Building at 5 and 35 minutes past the hour. The last shuttle leaves NIST at 6:05 p.m.\n\nThe ride between NIST and the Shady Grove Metro Station takes approximately 15 minutes, depending on traffic conditions.\n\nIf bad weather causes a delayed opening or early closure of NIST, the shuttle schedule will be adjusted. If there is a delayed opening, the first shuttle will leave Shady Grove one hour prior to opening time, and will leave the station every 15 minutes until 11:00 a.m. Starting at 11:05 a.m., the shuttle will return to its normal schedule."
