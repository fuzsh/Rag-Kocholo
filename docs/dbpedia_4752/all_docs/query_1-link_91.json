Airports on time for our flights and wheelchair de vice as needed.\n\nTry Omalnk - it is so much easier to sit back and let Omalnk drive you There!\n\nSome of the other comments that are negative must be from old owners as I really have never had those problems they talk of.\n\nThank You OMALiNK for getting me to airport and home Safely!\n\n- Pam and Evelyn\n\nI had the pleasure of riding the shuttle M-F, twice a day for training from Omaha to Lincoln for about 6 weeks. Obviously, I spent quite a bit of time in the shuttle and got to know most of the drivers pretty well. They take their jobs very seriously and care about their customers genuinely. They want to do their best to limit wait times at airports and get people where they need to go, sometimes having to juggle around multiple schedules due to flight delays and last minute pick ups. (You do learn alot riding for 2 hours a day).\n\nEach and every driver (with the exception of one), was extremely friendly, prompt, and had safety as their number one priority.\n\nI was initially dreading having to be shuttled every day for so long. Now I can say that I am gonna miss my morning chats with Tom, and my afternoon rides with Jack and Al.\n\nThanks for making my trips bearable and putting up with my chattiness! I will definitely be using you if I need a ride in the future.\n\n- Christina E."
