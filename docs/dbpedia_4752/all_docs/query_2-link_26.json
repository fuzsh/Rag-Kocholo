If visitors elect to drive their personal vehicles into the park, they will be charged a $35 fee at the entrance station (free for pass holders).\n\nOnce inside the park, all visitors will have the option of using the shuttle throughout their stay. We ask that visitors who drive into the park leave their car at the Additional Parking Lot across from the Visitor Center when riding the shuttle. Pets are not permitted on the shuttle.\n\nStill interested in driving your own vehicle? You can get parking lot information and see when they are busiest on our Parking Information page.\n\nCamping and lodging fees are separate from park admission fees. Use of the shuttle costs nothing in addition to these.\n\nNo, it's not necessary for commercial buses to unload their passengers to ride our shuttle. Commercial buses are allowed at the same viewpoints as shuttle buses, and we appreciate the fact that commercial buses are already doing their part to provide mass transit to park visitors. When appropriate, parking permits are given to buses by entrance station rangers.\n\nEmbed Video\n\nVisit our keyboard shortcuts docs for details\n\nDuration:\n\n1 minute, 40 seconds\n\nVisiting Bryce Canyon between April and October?
