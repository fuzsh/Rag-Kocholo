        "text": "Blue Jay Shuttles are equipped with power sliding doors, onboard cameras, and TransLoc, a GPS-based real-time transit information system available online or through a mobile device.\n\nTo make ride requests and track the shuttle vans, go to ondemand.transloc.com on a computer or smartphone. TransLoc’s free app is available at transloc.com/app. Dispatchers are available during operating hours at 410-516-8700.\n\nBlue Jay Shuttles will wait up to three minutes upon arrival at the designated pickup location. Passengers are expected to carry all personal items, backpacks, briefcases, etc., on and off the shuttle so as to ensure the shuttle is on time.\n\nEach Johns Hopkins campus has different operating hours, service areas, and operating days.\n\nHomewood Service (year-round except for holidays)\n\nEast Baltimore Service (available year-round)\n\nThe Blue Jay Shuttle offers a shared ride, so you may or may not be the only passenger and may or may not be dropped off directly. Service parameters include picking up passengers within 15 minutes of request and ride lengths not exceeding 20 minutes. During busy times (rush hours), shuttles may take up to 20 minutes to arrive. Dispatchers track the shuttles, and if a ride cannot be provided in a timely manner, a free Lyft will be dispatched. Passengers do not need a Lyft account or app; messages will be sent regarding what vehicle to expect.\n\nBlue Jay Shuttles all have three-digit numbers (for example, 705, 980). Lyft provides their vehicles’ make, model, color, and license plate. Please confirm before boarding, and provide your first name and last initial to the driver to expedite trips.\n\nJohns Hopkins affiliates are permitted a reasonable number of guest passengers, typically limited to four or one family group. Children are welcome as guests or can be considered an affiliate if enrolled in childcare programs or classes.\n\nChildren under the age of 8 must ride in a car seat provided by, installed by, and removed by a Johns Hopkins affiliate guardian who is also a passenger.\n\nBlue Jay Shuttle is partnering with Lyft to support safe transportation options within an approximately 1.5-mile radius of the East Baltimore campus, offering free rides for all member organizations, including The Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (SOM), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. The shuttle service will consolidate and supplement all current safe-ride services, including Lyft SafeRide and the After-Hours route, into one program. It will exclude any trips that are not home-to-campus or campus-to-home. Any Johns Hopkins employee visiting and staying on the East Baltimore campus can also use the service.\n\nYes, other campus locations, including Carey Business School, Peabody campus, and the Candler Building, are also valid destinations.\n\nEast Blue Jay Shuttle is not a social service. It will exclude any trips that are not home-to-campus or campus-to-home.\n\nPlease use an alternative transportation method, such as fixed-route shuttles, the Charm City Circulator, MTA, or your own ride-hailing account (Lyft, Uber, etc.) to travel to restaurants, grocery stores, or other errands.\n\nProviding a majority of rides in Blue Jay Shuttle vans with professional, trained drivers, GPS-tracking for passengers and supervisors, and onboard cameras greatly improves the security and oversight to ensure all passengers have a safe, comfortable ride.\n\nThe Blue Jay Shuttle is an equitable transportation option for all Hopkins affiliates. It will expand access to service to a much larger population of riders while continuing to serve those previously enrolled in SafeRide.\n\nThe current Lyft SafeRide program is only for students and trainees, not employees.\n\nSince the After-Hours Shuttle operates during similar hours in a smaller area, the Blue Jay Shuttle will replace this service.\n\nDrivers are trained to be an extra set of eyes, both on the road and for passengers who are pedestrians to and from the shuttle. Dispatchers and a supervisor know where all vehicles and passengers are at all times.\n\nPassengers have easy access to current and past rides.\n\nVehicles are well maintained and on-board cameras provide peace of mind.\n\nBlue Jay Shuttles are easy to recognize and provide passengers with plenty of space.\n\nSometimes, overall system demand is low and sometimes high. Dispatchers actively monitor operations to ensure that trips are assigned, and riders are picked up in a timely fashion. Additionally, the service area is geographically large and diverse, and depending upon the address of your residence, you may see wait or ride times within the higher end of the target service times if you are towards the edges of the service boundaries."
