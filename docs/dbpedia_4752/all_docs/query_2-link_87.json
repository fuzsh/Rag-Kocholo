        "text": "Denver Airport Parking – Covered and Uncovered\n\nPark your car with USAirport PARKING and save time and money, over airport rates. Our location is close to Denver International Airport – DEN/DIA. No need to drive around a parking garage looking for a space- we direct you right to an open spot. You don’t have to walk from your car to the terminal, our shuttle bus picks you up right at your car, and drops you right at curbside check-in. When you return we pick-up every 7 to 10 minutes and drop you off at your car. We’ll even help load and unload your luggage.\n\nWe offer Uncovered spaces, and Covered Parking – a canopy over the top of the parking area offering your car some protection from sun, rain and snow. While you are away, we can service your vehicle with oil changes that include a 9 point inspection, so your vehicle is healthy and ready to go when you get back . We are the premier airport parking location for Denver International Airport (DEN).\n\nUSAirport Parking Rates and Payment\n\nParking charges are based on a 24-hour day; beginning at the time you enter the facility. There is a 15-minute grace period. A fractional amount of time beyond a day, but less than 4 hours is charged at our hourly rate of $2.00/hour for open parking or $3.00/hour covered. Beyond four hours, customers are charged for an additional day. For example, if parked uncovered ($12.00/day and $2/hour) on Monday, January 1st at 1 PM, and exit on Tuesday, January 2nd at 2 PM, you would be charged $14.00 plus a 10% Airport Access Payment.\n\nTransportation between USAirport Parking and the terminal is included in the 10% Airport Access Payment.\n\nMonthly/ Yearly Rates\n\nFor our more frequent parkers, we do offer monthly and yearly prepaid rates. Included in those rates are unlimited exits and entrances for the duration of your prepaid plan. Please note that coupons and other promotions such as our Frequent Parkers Program cannot be used in conjunction with our monthly/yearly rate plans."
