He greets people as “friend” and seems to know people by name that ride on his bus often and always checks in on how they are doing. In a world where he could just get us from Point A to Point B, he chooses to go the extra mile and be kind.”\n\n“We congratulate National Express Shuttle and Transit and our PART staff on winning a 2022 NCDOL Safety Award. It reflects a dedication to maintaining a safe working environment and providing efficient, effective, and safe public transit service to citizens of the Piedmont Triad.”"
