The app will provide an estimated pick-up time and it will adjust the time if conditions change.\n\nWhen you request the shuttle, you will be put into a queue to be picked up; the length of the wait for your pick-up is dependent on the demand for the shuttle at the time.\n\nYou may experience a delay in receiving a pick-up notification during high volume times as the TransLoc app algorithm assesses which vehicle can pick you up.\n\nIt is recommended that you not cancel the shuttle and then immediately rebook it; this just puts you further down the list for pick-up.\n\nStep 5: Arrive at the pick-up location in advance. When you see the On-Demand Shuttle, be sure to signal to the driver that you are being picked up.\n\nYou must be at the stop when the shuttle arrives; they can’t wait for you.\n\nThere may be a short delay in service during driver shift changes.\n\nIf you’re using other Mason Shuttles, you can track it on the Transloc app, searching for George Mason under the Routes section.\n\nShare the Campus Together\n\nWhether you walk, bike, or scoot, we're all part of the Mason Community! Please be mindful and share the road for all types of riders. See below for tips and resources for keeping our campus safe and inclusive."
