We determine the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences.\n\nIn addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer information and other assistance to family members and survivors for each accident or event we investigate.\n\nWe also serve as the appellate authority​ for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Coast Guard, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.​​​​\n\n​\n\n​"
