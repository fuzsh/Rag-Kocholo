        "text": "Take MTS to the Airport\n\nRoute 992\n\nThere are two easy ways to get to between the airport and MTS services. First, there’s the Route 992 which stops right outside of baggage claim at both terminals. It only takes 15 minutes to get to/from Santa Fe Depot in Downtown San Diego, which connects with all major transit options, including three Trolley lines, three Rapid bus lines, the COASTER, and Amtrak. To get to the airport, there’s a convenient stop at Kettner Blvd. and W. Broadway (in front of Starbucks), which is across the street from Santa Fe Depot and all connecting transit services. Service on the 992 is every 15 minutes for most of the day, 7 days a week. One-way fares are just $2.50 ($1.25 for Seniors, Disabled, Medicare Recipients and Youth). There are also Ticket Machines at the Airport near Information Centers and at the Santa Fe Depot and America Plaza Trolley stations where you can buy a PRONTO card and add value to take trips all during your stay in San Diego. You can use the PRONTO app on your smartphone for your whole trip!\n\nView 992 Schedule\n\nAirport Shuttle\n\nThe second option is a free airport shuttle from the Old Town Transit Center. It’s called the San Diego Flyer and it picks up and drops off passengers on the east side of the transit center near the depot building (out on the island - see map below).\n\nThe San Diego Flyer operates approximately every 20-30 minutes, seven days a week. Pick-up and drop-offs are timed to meet the first and last Trolley, Coasters, Amtrak trains, and MTS busses with the first pick-up at 4:45 a.m. and the last pick-up/drop-off at 12:30 a.m. This is a service for transit riders only. There is NO OVERNIGHT PARKING at the Old Town Transit Center. For more information on this service, please visit the san.org website and its public transportation page.\n\nVisit san.org\n\nVisiting San Diego?"
