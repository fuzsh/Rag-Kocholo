Thank you for your understanding.\n\nRoute 2M Service Suspended Until Further Notice - Beginning Friday, June 21st, 2024: Route 2M service will be suspended. Please use Route 2T during this time. ACT did receive feedback asking to consider suspending Route 2T instead of 2M should the need arise, since 2M provides a more direct route downtown. After much deliberation, several factors influenced the decision to cancel Route 2M over 2T:\n\nRoute 2T connects to all routes at the Transit Center, while 2M does not connect to Route 6 during non-peak times or Route 5\n\nRoute 2T provides service to more areas in White Rock, and allows for bi-directional travel in White Rock\n\nRoute 2T provides service to Elk Ridge\n\nRoute 2T schedule aligns with school release times, should the suspension extend to the start of school\n\nACT thanks their riders for the feedback and apologizes for the inconvenience of the suspension. Recruiting efforts will continue so that Route 2M can resume as soon as staffing levels are sufficient to operate the service.\n\nDetours and Bus Stop Closures\n\nNone Currently\n\nHolidays and Holiday Service\n\nNone Currently\n\nSeasonal Services\n\nSummer Concert Service - Beginning Friday, May 24th through August 30th: Summer Concert Series bus service to start every Friday from around 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM.
