Patrons requiring accessible cart service can pick up that service from this location.\n\nPick-up at the end of the concert is located at the transportation hub on Highland Avenue. Follow signs and staff directions.\n\nParking is free at Bowl Shuttle lots, except at Ovation Hollywood (formerly Hollywood & Highland) where parking has a $20 daily maximum.\n\nAdvanced sales are available until one hour before the concert.\n\nDepartures from lots begin 2 1/2 hours prior to concert. The last shuttle departs each lot at concert time."
