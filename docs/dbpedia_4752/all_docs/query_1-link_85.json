        "text": "Many transportation directors have concerns about going from diesel to electric. While switching to an electric vehicle fleet requires thoughtful planning and expert guidance, you don’t have to do it alone.\n\nSchool’s out! The summer break is the perfect time to perform needed repairs and catch up on any school bus maintenance that might have been put off during the hectic school year.\n\nNavistar is committed to offering our customers products and services which support a sustainable future. This agreement enables the regulatory certainty we all need to prepare for a future which will include ever increasing volumes of low and zero-emissions technologies\n\nGovernment and state funding is available for electric vehicle (EV) fleets; although, many aren’t sure how much money is out there or how to access these funds. Since EV incentives are a key part of the equation and a cost-effective way for truck and bus fleets to begin building out their networks, International Truck and IC Bus have each created a dedicated team to provide grant application support to customers. Learn more in the latest episode of “The EV Fleet Road Map” podcast.\n\nLearn more from A.J. Palmisano, Director, EV Charging and Infrastructure, and Quanta Services, our partner in all things in power delivery, building out charging infrastructure, and working with utilities, about rate structures, utilizing off-peak and scheduled charging practices, and procuring incentives for vehicle-to-grid charging.\n\nWhen installing medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicle charging infrastructure, it’s easier, faster, and more cost effective to future proof right off the bat. A.J. Palmisano, Director, EV Charging and Infrastructure, details all things charging—the good, the daunting, and the lessons learned."
