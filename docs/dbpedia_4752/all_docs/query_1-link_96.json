        "text": "GO Airport Express\n\nChicago Airport Shuttle, Airport Transportation, and Around Town Rides\n\nIntroducing GO Taxi Direct – our newest – and most economical option – for Chicago airport transportation. Passengers can travel directly to their destination without stops, without the meter, and without the surge! It’s a low cost ride to or from the airport, backed by a brand you can trust.\n\nWe know travelers still want and need affordable airport transportation. While GO Airport Express offers shared ride airport shuttle on a limited basis, GO Taxi Direct offers passengers a choice to still travel safely at a low cost. Our shared ride now features smaller vehicles to make your experience better. With fewer stops, ample luggage space, and more comfortable seating, we’re taken the shared ride experience to a new level.\n\nWe provide transportation to both O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Midway Airport (MDW). Our cabs, SUVs, and sedans can take you to/from downtown Chicago, Chicago hotels, Chicago universities and college campuses, convention centers including McCormick Place and Navy Pier, as well as most suburban residential locations. We can provide airport transportation for individuals, groups, and corporate travel.\n\nGO Airport Express also offers around town, or point-to-point transportation and hourly charters for groups of all sizes.\n\nWhile the industry has changed since our founding in 1853, our mission has always remained the same – to provide convenient and affordable transportation services throughout Chicago. We continue to have a great relationship with the City, the major event venues and hotels, and we remain the only airport shuttle company in Chicago with the required certification from the Illinois Commerce Commission to provide shared ride shuttle services from both major Chicago airports. If you’re traveling in and around Chicago, go with a company with over 150 years of experience transporting people safely, GO with us."
