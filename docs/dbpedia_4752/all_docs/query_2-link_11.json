        "text": "The Sequoia Shuttle season starts May 23, 2024, and runs through September 2, 2024. To make reservations or purchase gift certificates, click the Reserve Now button. Follow us on Instagram or Facebook @SequoiaShuttle for giveaways and discount days.\n\nReserve Now\n\nAll riders on the Visalia-Sequoia Shuttles are required to have a national park entrance pass (e.g., standard 7-day entrance pass, annual pass, etc.) before entering Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Entrance passes can be purchased in advance on Recreation.gov.\n\nEntrance Fees & Passes\n\nIndividuals traveling as a group on a shuttle entering the park who would otherwise use a single private vehicle are not required to pay a combined fee greater than the private vehicle fee of $35. These groups should purchase one vehicle entrance pass for the whole group rather than individual entrance passes for each group member. For example, a family of four should not purchase four individual passes (4 x $20 = $80), but rather should purchase one vehicle pass (1 x $35) to cover the whole group."
