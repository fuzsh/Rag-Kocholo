        "text": "SacRT SmaRT Ride – Shuttle Service that Comes to You\n\nAttention SacRT SmaRT Ride App Users!\n\nThe SacRT SmaRT Ride app now has a “one-time password” option for users to log in to their accounts. This allows riders to sign up and log in with a code via SMS text or phone call instead of their password. Riders can access their accounts more securely using their phone as identification with fewer failed log-in attempts due to incorrect password entry.\n\nTo set it up, riders needed only to log in to the app, and select the option to enter their phone number. They received the code, and were able to log in to the system, instead of using their email and password combination.\n\nIf a rider changed their phone number and the system isn’t recognizing them, they will need to contact support to ensure the new number is associated with their account, as they won’t be able to create a new account with a new phone number but same email address.\n\nRiders who were already logged into their SmaRT Ride account did not need to do anything.\n\nSmaRT Ride is similar to other ride-share services where customers can use a smartphone app to request a ride that will pick up and drop off passengers within the service boundaries.\n\nSmaRT Ride Service Areas\n\nCitrus Heights-Antelope-Orangevale offers curb-to-curb service where passengers are picked up and dropped off at the address they indicated when scheduling.\n\nAll other service areas offer corner-to-corner service where passengers are picked up and dropped off at the nearest corner or ‘virtual bus stop,’ which is usually within a block or two of their pickup or drop-off location. The Downtown Core (north of S Street, west of 20th Street in downtown Sacramento) will be a limited stop zone, where Smart Ride will pick up and drop off at specific destinations as noted on the map.\n\nCurb-to-curb service areas:\n\nCitrus Heights-Antelope-Orangevale\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nCorner-to-corner service areas:\n\nArden-Carmichael\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformation Flyer (Spanish)\n\nDowntown-Midtown\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformation Flyer (Spanish)\n\nElk Grove\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nFlorin-Gerber\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nFolsom\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nFranklin-South Sacramento\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nNatomas-North Sacramento\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nRancho Cordova\n\nInformational Flyer\n\nInformational Flyer (Spanish)\n\nMap of Nine SmaRT Ride Zones\n\nNew Improved Transit Options\n\nSacRT launched an improved SmaRT Ride app to improve the customer experience by providing all the transit options available near them when a SmaRT Ride shuttle is unavailable due to high demand or other factors.\n\nWith the updated app, customers can easily explore various routes and schedules, and receive real-time updates for fixed-route buses, light rail, and other modes of public transportation. If SmaRT Ride isn’t available, the app assists by offering the most convenient alternative transit option.\n\nHow to Ride SmaRT Ride:\n\nCheck out out step-by-step guide on how to use the SacRT SmaRT Ride app! Click the image below to open as a PDF.\n\nFirst, download the free SmaRT Ride App, which is available in Google Play and the App Store.\n\nTo request a ride, enter a pick-up address and then enter your destination address. Note: SmaRT Ride shuttles cannot travel outside the service boundary. The pick-up and drop off location need to be inside the same service zone.\n\nFollowing a SmaRT Ride request, the SmaRT Ride app will provide passengers with an estimated pick-up time, track their bus in real-time, and be alerted when their ride is about to arrive. Passengers will also be alerted when their ride is about to reach their desired destination.\n\nSmaRT Ride customers will also be able to request rides by calling 916-556-0100 or by going online to ondemand.sacrt.com; however, trip requests must be made on the same day. Wait times for service are subject to vehicle availability and demand.\n\nThe drop off window is an estimate based on your desired travel time. Because this is a ride-sharing service, actual drop-off time may vary due to demand. Please understand that while we make every effort to arrive at your desired travel time, you may have a slight wait for the SmaRT Ride shuttle arrival due to demand. If you must arrive at your destination at a specified time, we recommend planning your trip to include a time cushion.\n\nSmaRT Ride service is only available within each designated service zone. SmaRT Ride shuttles cannot travel outside the service boundaries.\n\nHave more questions?
