        "text": "As the Pilot shortage continues to grow, and airlines across the country increasingly scramble to find qualified applicants, Republic Airways has launched an innovative new program for Pilots to join the world’s largest operator of Embraer aircraft and fly with the industry’s best-in-class contract.\n\nIt’s called the RJET Cadet Flight Time Initiative (FTI), rjet.com/FTI, a creative first that pays for up to the last 100 hours of flight time for Pilots to achieve their ATP ratings and includes a conditional offer to fly for Republic. That’s a huge savings, considering flight time can cost hundreds of dollars an hour.\n\nProgram Manager 170 Shane Tilley and Captains Ryan Lynch and Nick Hammond are leading the program.\n\n“The airline industry is definitely different than when I first started. People just aren’t graduating college with their multi-engine rating anymore,” said Shuttle America Capt. Hammond, an FTI architect who joined the Company in 2006. “Because federal rules and regulations have changed with ATP minimums, people just don’t have the flight time anymore, and it’s expensive for them to get it.”\n\nThat’s where the FTI comes in. Qualified candidates are set up with a flight school in the Midwest, where they undergo a compact flight training schedule to finish out their hours. Next steps in the two-month process: ATP/CTP certification training at Republic; INDOC training in Indianapolis; systems classes, including SIT and GFS training; and simulator sessions. The final steps are IOE (Initial Operating Experience), after which the FTI cadet is released to the line as a First Officer flying an Embraer 170/175 aircraft for Republic Airways. The program includes transportation and lodging during the training.\n\nDozens of applicants have engaged Republic since the program launched late this summer. The first FTI candidates began their training in September, and a second group began with the program October 17.\n\nThe genesis for the FTI initiative? It actually came from a group of Republic’s flight operations summer interns, who were concerned about the looming lack of flight hours upon graduation from their college programs. Hammond worked with the group to mold and shape the initiative, then connected them with key players of Talent Acquisition and Corporate Communications to expand the concept, as well as set them up with meetings at various flight schools and universities to promote the program.\n\n“I think it’s important that Republic stays ahead of the game and takes advantage of opportunities like this, and I think we did a good job of that,” Hammond said.\n\nTo spread the word, Republic’s Corporate Communications department, in tandem with Talent Acquisition, put together a robust marketing plan, including print and digital collateral to distribute at universities, a YouTube video featuring Hammond and the other FTI architects explaining the program, a series of external webinars that drew an unprecedented number of participants, and a public website – rjet.com/FTI – containing all the need-to-know information and more.\n\nIt’s been a game-changer for Republic’s recruiting department, too, which has seen a huge surge in inquiries, emails and phone calls for information about how to sign up. Response has been so heavy that Republic’s recruiting department has dedicated a full-time Associate to manage the program.\n\n“When you look at the cost of buying flight time hours, it adds up quickly, pricing many Pilots out of a career,” said Scott Sendelweck, Sr. Manager of Talent Acquisition for Republic. “Our program helps Pilots turn the corner so they can quickly and easily find their way into a cockpit.”\n\n“The FTI Program is a great way for an aviator to kick-start their regional airline career,” Sendelweck added. “Once again, Republic Airways is pushing the Talent Acquisition envelope by developing a world-class entry point into the regional space.”"
