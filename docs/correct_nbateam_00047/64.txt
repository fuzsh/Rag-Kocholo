PORTLAND, Ore. The Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday traded Gerald Wallace to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for center Mehmet Okur, forward Shawne WIlliams and a 2012 first round draft pick.

The draft pick is protected if it is in the top three.

"This trade was very compelling to us because not only does it give us more flexibility in free agency, but we also acquire a very attractive first-round draft pick," said acting General Manager Chad Buchanan.

The Blazers also announced they requested waivers on Greg Oden and Chris Johnson.
