The Boston Globe's Gary Washburn suggested this morning that there could be interest around the league in Gerald Wallace as his contract inches toward its expiration date after the 2015-16 season.

Don't be surprised if a team such as the Portland Trail Blazers tries to make a bid for Celtics swingman Gerald Wallace and offers some unwanted expiring contracts for Boston's troubles. Wallace, 32, played parts of two seasons with Portland and enjoyed his stint there. He was seen joking during the Celtics-Blazers game with Portland All-Star forward LaMarcus Aldridge. The closer Wallace's anchor-like contract nears conclusion, the easier it will be to move. Wallace is attractive to a club seeking a veteran leader who can defend in spot minutes.

At first glance, making the money work in a deal to Portland would be difficult without including another team or the Blazers trading part of their core, which for Wallace obviously wouldn't happen. It is also unclear what type of sweetener in terms of a young player or pick the Celtics would have to add to facilitate a deal.

After some troubles adjusting to life on a rebuilding team at the beginning of last year, Wallace has accepted his role this season and Brad Stevens has had nothing but good things to say about the veteran forward. Nevertheless, the Celtics would presumably jump at any chance to unload Wallace's hefty contract.
