The Portland Trail Blazers have agreed in principle to trade Gerald Wallace to the New Jersey Nets for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams and a protected first-round pick, league sources told Yahoo! Sports.

Wallace, 29, is averaging 13.3 points and 6.6 rebounds this season.

The draft pick the Blazers received is protected only through the top three spots.
