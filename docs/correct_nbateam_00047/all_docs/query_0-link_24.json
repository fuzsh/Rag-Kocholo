        "text": "Then came a bum back. Wallace attempted an up-and-under move on Peja Stojakovic in the paint late in the first quarter and said his back “locked.” He left with 36.5 seconds left in the first and did not play in the second. The Mavericks took over, outscoring the Blazers 33-16 to take a 52-43 lead into the locker room. They never looked back. “We lost Gerald in that first half and lost a little momentum in the second quarter,” McMillan said. “It took a while to get going (afterward).”\n\nAnd did you know he is 14th in NBA history in assists? Most people don’t. Players, though, respect Miller, whether they play with him or against him. Portland’s starting small forward, Gerald Wallace, played most of his career with the Charlotte Bobcats and saw Miller a lot when he played in Philly. “I always knew about Andre Miller,” said Wallace. “Playing against him I knew he always ran the floor, ran the team, ran the offense no matter what team he was on – Philly in those days. You don’t really get to know him personally until you’ve played with him, but his understanding of the game, his recognition of the game, [and] his sight on the floor is amazing. I think he’s one of the best – underrated – point guards in this league.”\n\nMarion has always been a highly regarded defender — he’s a two-time All-NBA Third Team selection — and he was a defensive force on the Phoenix Suns teams that reached two Western Conference Finals teams in the mid-2000s. But even at the twilight of his career, Marion holds defensive cache. Monday night, he had four steals and two blocks. He downplayed his role after Game 5, saying there’s nothing fancy to what he has done. He’s merely tried to take easy baskets away from Wallace, deny him the ball and “make it hard for him when he does get the ball.” Apparently, the easy equation has no solution. “I’ve been watching Gerald,” Marion said. “I know Gerald. He’s a competitor. But you can make it hard for them. You take away easy buckets and you make them take contested shots. You can make them have a rough night. “The one thing I’ve learned about the NBA game is you can’t just have a guy have free range at you. Because if not, he’s going to have a big night.”\n\nThe Trail Blazers’ 13 fast break points in Game 1 was three more than their regular season average. But Wallace insists they need more to have an advantage over the Mavericks. “We’re going to have to get push them and get out and make therm run and force them to play on their heels,” Wallace said. “They had us on our heels in Game 1. We have to push the pace, use our athleticism to make them play on their heels a little bit. We have to use our speed to our advantage and flip this thing around a little bit to take them out of their comfort zone.”"
