I mean Gerald Wallace is an ok player but to me you could get so much better in this draft. I don’t really see the Nets being better next year. Trading your top pick for Kevin Durant that I would have done.\n\nbecause you overreact after d12 decision to stay in orlando and you fear to lose deron williams….\n\nso you try to show him you can bring some player to help winning games and playing better. Finally you decide in a hurry to trade to be more effective NOW and retain deron williams and try another time to get d12 this summer.\n\nBut I’m agree with you I think that’s a BS trade…. not enough protected pick.\n\nridiculous, unless the Magic covet Wallace as a replacement for Hedo. I would have sent a protected 8th because I could have guaranteed we finish lower than that. The Warriors, Nets and Cavs won over the last coulpe days against all sanity. Everybody says its cowardly to lose on purpose but I bet the Redskins and Browns wish they lost more last year and wouldnt have had to offer 3 first rounders and a 2 to get RG3. Whoever ends with Harrison Barnes instead of Davis is going to be p!ssed. I think Anthony Davis/Drummond/ TRob with Wallace and Brooks would get D12 easily. They could swing a sign and trade for wing help for Lopez in a separate deal and actually be pretty good. Remember Boozer, Blanche/Lewis, Garnet, Allen, J. Smith, Nash and a host of other NBA players who will be free agents.\n\nThe Nets are in panic mode, they’re moving the Brooklyn with no star attraction but are completely operating the wrong way, they should have used the Oklahoma City model and built a team up through the draft which helps building a fan base in the process, getting Howard would have been great but it didn’t happen, they should have moved Deron Williams if anything he would have gotten them a young prospect and a least a 1st or 2 if they traded him to a team he would re-sign with.\n\nDwight Howard’s back and forth put them in an awkward position and they acted in panic. So now they better hope they get a top 3 pick, hopefully do a sign and trade with Deron Williams to add a young talent and future picks"
