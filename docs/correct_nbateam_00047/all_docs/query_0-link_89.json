        "text": "With the season over, it’s time to look back at the inaugural Brooklyn campaign for the Nets. To do so, I’m going to take a look at each player on the roster, examining how they got here, what happened this season, and what their future holds. Next up is Gerald Wallace.\n\n2012-13 Regular season statistics:\n\nAveraged 7.7 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.7 blocks in 30.1 minutes per game in 69 games (68 starts). Shot 39.7 percent from the field, 28.2 percent from 3-point range and 63.7 percent from the foul line.\n\n2012-13 Playoff statistics:\n\nAveraged 12.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 0.7 blocks in 34.7 minutes per game in seven games (seven starts). Shot 46.3 percent from the field, 37.9 percent from 3-point range and 55.0 percent from the foul line.\n\nHow he got here:\n\nThe Nets acquired Wallace in a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers on March 15, 2012, in exchange for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams and a top-three protected first round pick. Wallace opted out of the final year of his contract last summer, and then inked a four-year, $40 million deal to remain with the Nets.\n\nSeason in review:\n\nWhen the Nets went through their drastic roster overhaul last summer, Gerald Wallace was one of the four cornerstones of the newly formed Nets team as it entered Brooklyn, along with Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez. And, as the season began, he was often called their most irreplaceable player, as well, for the simple reason that unlike the other three, who had reliable understudies to replace them in the instance that one of them had to sit due to injury (C.J. Watson for Williams, MarShon Brooks for Joe Johnson and Andray Blatche for Lopez), the Nets lacked such an option behind Wallace.\n\nAnd, for the first few months of the season, Wallace did the things the Nets expected him to do. He played his usual strong defense on the opposing team’s top scorer, and while his scoring was down because of the fact that he wasn’t getting as many shots as he did previously because of the presence of Williams, Johnson and Lopez – who combined to take a combined 44 shots per game, on average – he still was shooting near his averages from the previous two seasons, was actually shooting better from 3-point range than he had in several seasons (he shot 35 percent from behind the arc through the All-Star Break, better than he’d shot since the 2009-10 season) and was still dishing out well over two assists per game.\n\nBut when Wallace returned from the All-Star Break, he seemed to leave his shot behind. In the 26 games he played after the break through the end of the regular season, Wallace’s shooting numbers were truly shocking – he made just 33.5 percent of his shots, a full 10 points lower than he shot before the break, and shot an incredible 13.5 percent from 3-point range.\n\nIt got to the point where Wallace told me in early April that his confidence was “totally gone” in his shot after he failed to take a single shot while playing over 30 minutes in a Nets win over his former team, the Charlotte Bobcats, on April 7.\n\nBut then, just when it looked like Wallace was a lost cause for the remainder of the season, things completely changed in the playoffs. Although it was a small sample size, Wallace was very good for the Nets in Brooklyn’s seven-game loss to the Bulls in the first round, averaging 12 points per game on 46.3 percent shooting and 37.9 percent shooting from 3-point range, taking full advantage of the fact that the Bulls left him alone on offense – certainly not an unsurprising strategy, given how poorly he played at that end of the floor over the final two months of the year.\n\nWallace, in fact, was arguably the best player on the floor for the Nets in their disappointing Game 7 loss to the depleted Bulls, scoring 19 points on 8-for-16 shooting – including going 3-for-8 from 3-point range – in 40 minutes in what eventually became a 99-93 loss.\n\nWhere does he go from here?\n\nIn his introductory press conference as the team’s next head coach, Jason Kidd said two things that would likely lead to increased production from Wallace next season: a desire to push the tempo offensively, as well as to use Wallace in a point-forward role, which would allow Deron Willams to spend even more time off the ball than he already does.\n\nThere’s no question that Wallace, who has never been a player with a game fit for a halfcourt game like the Nets employed this past season, when they played as slowly as any team in the league, would benefit from things getting faster. And with his ball-handling and passing skills, combined with his size and length, it would be interesting to see how he’d adapt to playing in a point-forward type role.\n\nWallace still has three years and roughly $30 million left on his contract that he signed with the Nets last summer, and entering his age 32 season – combined with the style of play that’s aptly earned him the nickname “Crash” – how his body holds up over the next couple of seasons could be one of the biggest storylines to follow on the Nets. However, it’s clear the team is going to try to find ways to better utilize his skill set moving forward, and we’ll see how Wallace takes advantage of the opportunity.\n\ntbontemps@nypost.com"
