        "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) â€” A person with knowledge of the negotiations says the New Jersey Nets have acquired Gerald Wallace from the Portland Trail Blazers for two injured players and a protected first-round draft pick.\n\nThe Nets sent center Mehmet Okur and forward Shawne Williams to Portland along with their own 2012 draft pick. The pick is protected if it is in the top three, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the teams have not announced the deal.\n\nA 2010 All Star, Wallace is averaging 13.3 points and 6.6 rebounds in 42 starts. He also is an outstanding defensive small forward.\n\nOkur has been sidelined since Jan. 27 with a sore lower back. Williams is out for the year after having surgery on his left foot in early February.\n\n(Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
