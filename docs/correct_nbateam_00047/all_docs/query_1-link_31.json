        "text": "Federal agents swarmed Blazers practice Monday but instead of a bust, they were doing some recruiting. The FBI’s website says they aren’t hiring right now, but that didn’t stop the Portland branch from encouraging Trail Blazer Gerald Wallace from applying. When the 6 foot 7 inch forward got to the Rose City, he mentioned he’d like to join the FBI when he gets done in the NBA. So, five agents took in practice this week and encouraged the Alabama native to keep the bureau in mind.\n\nThe Blazers didn’t wilt. They didn’t back down. This felt different. And that fight in Portland’s heart became so obvious that the public address system played Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” coming out of a fourth-quarter timeout. Except the Lakers claim they barely noticed. “Physical?” Artest said, “I guess, maybe. I don’t know. I’m a physical player so that just feels normal to me. If (Gerald Wallace) wants to feel good about that, good for him. “The playoffs haven’t even started yet.”"
