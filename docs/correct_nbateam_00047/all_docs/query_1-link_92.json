        "text": "Yahoo Sports is reporting that the Nets and Portland Trail Blazers have agreed in principle on a deal that will send 6-7 forward Gerald Wallace to the Nets for a first round pick and two injured players, Mehmet Okur and Shawne Williams. According to Yahoo, the pick is their own for 2012, and is protected through the first three spots in the draft. The Nets still own the Houston Rockets' first rounder in 2012. That pick is lottery protected.\n\nWallace, 29, would step in to the starting small forward spot on the Nets' roster. DeShawn Stevenson, a 6-5 defense-first veteran, has been starting there, backed up by Gerald Green, the D-League refugee who is currently on his second 10-day contract. Wallace is averaging 13.3 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, while Green, who has played nine games for the Nets, is averaging 11.0 points and 3.0 rebounds.\n\nFor now, the trade actually lowers the Nets' payroll, as Wallace is earning $9.5 million this year, with a player option for $9.5 million again next year. Okur is earning $10.9 million this year on an expiring deal. Williams is earning $3 million this year and $3.1 million next year."
