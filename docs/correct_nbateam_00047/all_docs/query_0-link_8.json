        "meta_description": "In a way, ever game Gerald Wallace has played with the Trail Blazers has been a road game. With his family still in Charlotte, Wallace comes \"home\" to an empty hotel room regardless of where the game is played. That's never an easy thing to do. And when you have a performance like the one Wallace had in Game 1, the idea of being alone with your thoughts and thousands of miles away from your loved ones is excruciating.",
