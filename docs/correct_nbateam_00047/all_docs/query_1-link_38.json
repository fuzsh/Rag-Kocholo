        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers are keeping tight lips with regards to the swirling trade rumors, with general manager Rich Cho keeping everyone, including the players and agents involved, in the dark. Gerald Wallce, of the Charlotte Bobcats, has seen his name connected to the Blazers on Wednesday afternoon, though nothing is official yet. With fans wondering aloud whether or not Wallace is about to be on the move, the Blazers would rather keep tight lips, focusing on Wednesday night's game instead.\n\nBut on Twitter, the official Portland Trail Blazers account had some fun with the rumor, answering a question from a follower. The question, pertaining to the status of Brandon Roy and Gerald Wallace, was simple enough, but the answer was perfectly executed.\n\nPerfect use of a Twitter account by the Blazers.\n\nOn the rumors front, Yahoo!'s Adrian Wojnarowski reports a deal for Wallace between the Blazers and Bobcats may be close, but nothing is final yet. It's still unknown which players are involved from the Portland side of things, as well. Additionally, the Cleveland Cavaliers are also a player that Wojnarowski says shouldn't be counted out."
