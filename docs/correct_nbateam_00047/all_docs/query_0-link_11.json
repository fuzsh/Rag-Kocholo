        "text": "Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nAn NBA trade that seemed to be forgotten went down to the wire and was finalized right at the deadline.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers traded the expiring contract of Joel Przybilla and a second-round pick for talented forward Gerald Wallace. The deal was first reported by Yahoo! Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe Bobcats were firm in their stance in getting at least a first-round pick for Wallace, so the Blazers pulled off a great move.\n\nWallace, in a down year, is still averaging 15.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game.\n\nThe 28-year-old forward will be a great addition to the lineup.\n\nThe Blazers refused to part with talented forward Nicolas Batum in all trades.\n\nThis deal will be categorized as a steal for the Trail Blazers, who will add Wallace to a core group of LaMarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy and Wesley Matthews."
