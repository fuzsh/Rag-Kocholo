        "text": "In a league of athletic fowards, Portland's Gerald Wallace is perhaps the most fearless. Despite a history of concussions and various injuries, Wallace continually sacrifices his body for rebounds, points and loose balls. He plays with reckless abandon, and it's earned him the fitting nickname of \"Crash.\"\n\nBut perhaps Wallace's skills and commitment to the cause are better served in another area of life. Like, say, while working for the government. Because the FBI recruited him at a recent Blazers practice. From Andrea Flatley at KTPV FOX 12 (via Tickle the Wire and Shoals):\n\nWallace left the University of Alabama after one season, and, as far as I know, has not returned to complete his degree. However, as I learned from the groundbreaking film \"Point Break,\" former athletes can quite easily become FBI agents who team up with Gary Busey to stop shamanic bank-robbing surfers and also fall in love with Lori Petty in the process. This is your future, Gerald, and I couldn't be happier for you.\n\nIn all honesty, this is probably a marketing ploy by the FBI, in the sense that it wants the general public -- and especially the fine people of Portland -- to know it has a sense of humor and it isn't just shadowy government bureaucrats who tap your phones because you voted for Ralph Nader. It's a curious move, considering Wallace doesn't currently meet its hiring guidelines, but it's also a nice bit of fun.\n\nSo don't be surprised if Gerald Wallace kicks in your door some day, domestic evildoers. He treats cases like defense, and always gets his man.\n\nFollow Yahoo! Sports on Facebook and be the first to know about the most interesting stories of the day."
