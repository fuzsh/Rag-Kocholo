        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Gerald Wallace was honored with a video tribute, two standing ovations and numerous chants of his name in his first game back in Charlotte since last month’s jolting trade.\n\nBut it was his best friend on his old club that got the better of him when it mattered most.\n\nStephen Jackson scored 18 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, including the go-ahead three-point play on a drive around Wallace in the final minute, and the Bobcats beat the Portland Trail Blazers 97-92 on Friday night to spoil Wallace’s emotional return.\n\nIn his first game back from a hamstring injury, Jackson finished one point shy of Wallace’s team record for points in a quarter as Charlotte snapped a six-game losing streak.\n\n“We sat back and let him get going and all of a sudden he found his groove,” Wallace said of Jackson. “I’ve seen him in that zone plenty of times.”\n\nWallace, the last original member of the seven-year-old Bobcats and their only All-Star, was traded last month for role players and draft picks, a move owner Michael Jordan said would give them “flexibility” to rebuild the roster in the next few years.\n\n•Nets 102, Clippers 98\n\nNEWARK, N.J. — Brook Lopez and Jordan Farmar each scored 24 points, combining for all eight of New Jersey’s in overtime, and the Nets rallied to beat the Los Angeles Clippers for their fourth straight victory.\n\nKris Humphries had 19 points, a career-high 20 rebounds and made all eight shots while playing All-Star Blake Griffin to at least a draw as the Nets erased a 20-point deficit for their longest winning streak since also taking four in a row from Jan. 31-Feb. 7, 2009.\n\nChris Kaman had 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Griffin added 23 points and nine boards, but he missed the potential go-ahead free throw with 1.2 seconds remaining in regulation. Randy Foye scored 19 points in his hometown, but the Clippers’ four-game winning streak was snapped.\n\nFarmar again started in place of All-Star point guard Deron Williams, who missed his second straight game after his wife gave birth to their fourth child in Dallas this week. He helped the Nets pull off their biggest comeback to win since also coming from 20 down to beat Atlanta on Jan. 2, 2009.\n\n•Raptors 108, Pacers 98\n\nTORONTO — Leandro Barbosa scored a season-high 29 points, Ed Davis had 12 points and 13 rebounds and the Toronto Raptors beat the Pacers, Indiana’s fifth straight loss in Toronto.\n\nThe Pacers lost their sixth straight overall and dropped into a tie with Charlotte for the final playoff spot in the East after the Bobcats beat Portland.\n\nDeMar DeRozan scored 16 points and James Johnson had 13 for the Raptors, who had lost three straight and 23 of 27.\n\nDanny Granger scored 25 points, Tyler Hansbrough had 20 and Darren Collison 13 for the slumping Pacers. Rookie Paul George added 10 points.\n\nToronto’s Jose Calderon had 13 points and eight assists and Reggie Evans had 16 rebounds.\n\n•76ers 89, Celtics 86\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Spencer Hawes had 14 points and 10 rebounds, Elton Brand scored 14 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Sixers led by 10 points and controlled the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics for most of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Celtics missed eight straight baskets over a 6-minute span late in the fourth to lose only their eighth conference game of the season.\n\nLou Williams’ jumper just a shade over the 5-minute mark put the Sixers ahead 83-81 and they never trailed again. Jodie Meeks made two free throws after he was hammered by Paul Pierce on a fast break attempt and the Sixers came away with one of their biggest wins of the season.\n\nNenad Krstic had 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Celtics.\n\nAndre Iguodala had 13 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Sixers. Meeks scored 12 and Thaddeus Young 11.\n\n•Bulls 94, Hawks 76\n\nCHICAGO — Derrick Rose came on strong after a slow start to finish with 34 points, and the Chicago Bulls ran away with their 12th win in 14 games, beating the struggling Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe Bulls prevailed on a night when Carlos Boozer sat out with a sprained left ankle thanks to a strong third quarter. Leading the way was Rose with 18 points in the period as the Bulls outscored Atlanta 24-10 to turn a two-point halftime deficit into a 72-60 lead, and Chicago pulled within a half game of Eastern Conference leader Boston.\n\nLuol Deng added 18 points even though he was questionable after bruising his left thigh when he took a knee from Charlotte’s Gerald Henderson on Wednesday. The Bulls won that game to clinch the Central division, but it was a costly victory.\n\n•Timberwolves 122, Jazz 101\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Kevin Love had 24 points and 12 rebounds and the Minnesota Timberwolves rolled to a victory over the sputtering Utah Jazz.\n\nLove extended the longest double-double streak since 1973-74 to 53 straight games and Michael Beasley scored 23 points for the Timberwolves, who snapped an incredible 20-game losing streak to Northwest Division opponents.\n\nGordon Hayward scored 18 points for the new-look Jazz, who have lost 10 of their last 13 games and are falling out of the playoff picture in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Jazz are 3-6 since trading start point guard Deron Williams and are looking a little lost without longtime leader Jerry Sloan, who resigned as coach on Feb. 10.\n\nTheir latest loss was their worst yet. The Jazz were down 19 points in the second quarter, pulled within two points in the third, only to get run out of the building by Beasley and Love in the final 4 minutes of the period.\n\nThe Timberwolves closed the third quarter on a 20-5 run during which Love grabbed a rebound to extend his streak and then hit a 3-pointer on the other end to make it 97-72 going into the fourth."
