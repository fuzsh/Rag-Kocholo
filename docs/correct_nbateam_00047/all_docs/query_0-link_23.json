        "text": "Portland has completed a deal to acquire Gerald Wallace from the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Joel Pryzbilla and draft picks.\n\nThe Blazers evidently feel that with Deron Williams and Carmelo Anthony out of the picture, they are in a strong position to make a playoff push.\n\nEven without star shooting guard Brandon Roy, Portland has held steady at fifth in the West. Denver is currently tied with the Blazers and Utah is one and a half games back, so Portland seems to feel that the path is cleared for them to hang on to a playoff berth in either the fifth or sixth slot.\n\nWallace, though not the player he once was, will provide the Blazers with another offensive option and will give them one of the better defensive units around.\n\nThis could also be a sign that Portland is trying to go all-in while Roy, who is scheduled to return tonight, still has anything left to give. Diagnoses have indicated that Roy may only have a year or two left of professional basketball, and the Blazers could be attempting to surround him with talent for one more playoff push."
