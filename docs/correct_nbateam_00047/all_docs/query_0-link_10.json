        "text": "6-foot-7, 220-pound forward\n\nAge:\n\n29\n\nHometown/College:\n\nChildersburg, Ala./Alabama\n\nNBA experience:\n\n11th season.\n\nContract status:\n\nIn the fifth year of a six-year $57 million deal. Will earn $9.5 million this season.\n\nRole:\n\nStarting small forward with fearless game and exceptional defense.\n\n2010-11 statistics:\n\n15.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.48steals with the Blazers and Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nStrengths/weaknesses:\n\nAfter being acquired at the trade deadline, Wallace was the force that pushed the Blazers into the playoffs last season. Now that the adjustment period is over, he could blossom into a do-it-all-type focal point of the team. He is one of the league's best defenders, and now that the team is running a more uptempo offensive style, he should benefit with more fast-break chances and easy scoring opportunities. Wallace is a streaky outside shooter, however, and he was hit and miss when playing power forward last season.\n\n»\n\n»"
