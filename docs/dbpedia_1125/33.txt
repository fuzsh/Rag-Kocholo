Dalhalla is an open air theatre located in a former limestone quarry, and is used as a summer music venue. It is located 7 km north of Lake Siljan and the municipality of Rättvik in Dalarna, central Sweden.

The quarry, previously known as Draggängarna, is 60 m deep, 400 m long and 175 m wide. It was in operation until 1990. The open air theater was opened in 1995 and currently has 4,000 seats. The acoustical qualities are comparable to the best outdoor stages in Europe.
