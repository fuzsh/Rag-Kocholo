It is fully comparable to the best outdoor venues in Europe and is even described as one of the most sonorous and beautiful outdoor venues in the world.\n\nYoutuber my journey so far has produced this video with this information: “We were treated to a concert at Dalhalla last week. Dalhalla s an open air theater located in an old limestone quarry and is used as a summer music venue. It is located 7 km north of Lake Siljan and the municipality of Rättvik in Dalarna, central Sweden. The quarry, previously known as Draggängarna, is 60 m deep, 400 m long and 175 m wide.”"
