        "text": "Unique theater\n\nDalhala â€“ a unique theater in a limestone quarry.\n\nAmong the most unusual music venues in the world is the Swedish Theatre Dalhalla. It is built at the bottom of an abandoned limestone quarry, thanks to which it has excellent natural acoustics. Its unique location and excellent sound have made the Dalhalla one of the most popular concert halls in Europe.\n\nDalhala Theater is located in central Sweden in the municipality of Rattvik in the province of Dalarna. It was built at the bottom of a limestone quarry surrounded by a forest. Next to the stage is a small emerald-colored lake, which is often an integral part of the theater scenery. The unusual music venue opened in 1993.\n\nDalhala is a large, modern, open-air auditorium. Surrounded by water, the stage has quickly become an ideal stage for opera and theater productions and a renowned international venue for musicians of all kinds."
