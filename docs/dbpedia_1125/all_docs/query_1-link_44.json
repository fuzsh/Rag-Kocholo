        "text": "Dalhalla is an open air theatre located in a former limestone quarry, and is used as a summer music venue. It is located 7 km north of Lake Siljan and the municipality of Rättvik in Dalarna, central Sweden.\n\nThe quarry, previously known as Draggängarna, is 60 m deep, 400 m long and 175 m wide. It was in operation until 1990. The open air theater was opened in 1995 and currently has 4,000 seats. The acoustical qualities are comparable to the best outdoor stages in Europe.\n\nSource\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\nCopyright: Creative Commons 3.0\n\nMore information\n\nStatistics"
