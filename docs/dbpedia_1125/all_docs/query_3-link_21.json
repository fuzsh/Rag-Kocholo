        "text": "8 things to do in Rättvik is a list of our favorite places in this beautiful city in Dalarna, Sweden. Here, you can not only find the world’s longest lake bridge. No, Rättvik has a lot more to offer even if it’s not that big of a town. A great way to start exploring is to take a walk around the city center and enjoy the atmosphere. Rättvik is a very popular town in Sweden that really comes alive during the summer.\n\nA short summary of Rättvik\n\nNestled by lake Siljan, this picturesque town looks like it’s taken from a postcard. People come from all over the world to go hiking, swimming, biking, and enjoying life. There are a lot of things to explore and several super special things to check out. This is also where the famous Classic Car Week is held each year. It’s Sweden’s largest meeting for nostalgic car lovers and it attracts large crowds to Rättvik.\n\nThis is one of the first cities that became a touristy area back in 1894 where the first hotel was built. It was the first hotel in Sweden to be built with a focus on tourism. Not sure if that hotel is still here but one thing’s for sure – there are a lot of hotels here. If you are traveling by motorhome, there’s also a camping right by the lake Siljan. A perfect town to visit while being in Dalarna and exploring Siljan.\n\n8 things to do in rättvik during summer\n\nDown below, we have gathered our favorite things to do in Rättvik during the summer. Most important is to take your time, walk around and check it out. Take a swim in lake Siljan and rent a bike to see more of the surroundings. If you are staying in Dalarna for a longer period, you should also make sure to visit Tällberg and Mora, two other cities that are very nice. We hope you like our list of 8 things to do in Rättvik.\n\nLångbryggan\n\n628 meters long and built in 1895. However, it wasn’t built to become the big tourist attraction it has become today. The pier was built lay-by for the steamboat “S/S Rättvik”. Today, it has become the biggest attraction in town and it’s almost mandatory to visit the pier while visiting Rättvik. At the end of the pier, there are benches so that you can sit down and relax before you head back.\n\nThe great pier is probably the world’s longest lake pier. It is like the Eiffel tower is for Paris and it’s very common to see people getting married out on the pier. The boat “M/S Gustav Vasa” uses the pier as a lay-by while shipping tourists around the area. We have been on an even longer pier that you can check out in Poland check out the Molo in Sopot, Poland.\n\nVidablick\n\nVidablick is a lookout tower that is 28 meters high. That might not sound like it’s that high up, but since it’s located on a mountain that is 352 meters above sea level. That combination gives you an incredible view of Rättvik. The name Vidablick loosely translates to “wide gaze” and it is an appropriate name for this lookout tower. It was built in 1898 and it’s a great place to visit.\n\nAt Vidablick, there’s more than “just” the lookout tower. Here, you can also visit the restaurant or café, play minigolf and buy some souvenirs in their handicraft shop. Vidablick is also a meeting place for motor-enthusiasts that come to Rättvik to show off their rides. When it opened in 1898, the entrance fee was 0,25 SEK (about 0,025 euros). Oh, how times have changed!\n\ninformation about vidablick\n\nAddress: Vidablicksvägen 50.\n\nOpening hours: During summer the lookout tower is opened daily between 10.00 and 18.00.\n\nEntrance fee: 35 SEK (about 3,50 euros) per adult.\n\nDalhalla\n\nA unique old limestone quarry that has transformed into a concert hall and open theatre. During summer the quarry explodes with music, theatre, and festivities. It is 60 meters deep, 400 meters long and 175 meters wide. Imagine the acoustics while listening to opera in here. It has to be a special and magical moment. Since the pandemic, the concerts and theatre performances have been canceled.\n\nHowever, Dalhalla has come up with a new concept and a way to stay busy during the pandemic. Their latest thing is that they allow motorhomes and caravans into the quarry. It’s a special place to spend the night and to have a great dinner. You can also book a guided tour of the quarry.\n\nInformation about dalhalla\n\nAddress: Riksvägen 40.\n\nOpening hours: Monday – Friday 10.00 – 18.00. Saturday 10.00 – 14.00. Sundays closed except for summertime. The factory is opened between 10.00 and 15.30.\n\nEntrance fee: free of charge.\n\nnittsjö keramik – ceramics factory\n\nCeramics is a big thing in Rättvik and Nittsjö Keramik is the pride of the city. The factory started in 1917 but has a history that dates back to 1847 when the factory was built. While making a list of 8 things to do in Rättvik, this is a must to include. Not only can you buy secondhand quality ceramics cheaper – but you can also get to see the artists at work. Today, the company is going strong with the fourth generation of the family Löfgren running the show.\n\nThey are famous for their Christmas gnomes and you can buy them at the factory. Their series “Allmoge” is also really popular among visitors and people that collect ceramics. It’s great to be able to walk around and see the people at work, creating new things that you can later buy in their shop. Nittsjö Keramik is an important part of Rättviks history.\n\nINformation about nittsjö keramik\n\nAddress: Nittsjö Keramikvägen 31.\n\nEntrance fee for a guided tour: 140 SEK (about 14 euros) per adult.\n\nFood: A three-course meal costs about 80 euros (without drinks) per person.\n\nRättviks Dala Horse\n\nDalarna is probably mostly known for the Dala Horse. Originated from Mora, the Dala horse has become a symbol not only for Dalarna but for all of Sweden. However, in Rättvik they have their own version of the horse – called Rättvikshästen. It is a bit slimmer than the original and it’s painted in grey. You can see the horse outside of the culture house in the city center.\n\nRättvikshästen was created in 1950s by John Gudmunds. Unlike the “original” this one is not as lavishly painted but it is still pretty and it makes for a nice picture. The horse was inspired by one carved horse that they found in the 1850s. If you want, you can also buy a small version of the horse at Gudmunds slöjd.\n\nRättviks hemslöjd\n\nForget about gift shops that sell knickknacks and things that you’ll never use. At Rättviks Hemslöjd, you are likely to want to buy everything that’s for sale. Here, you can buy Rättvikshästen as described above (in a smaller version). A personal favorite is the cutting boards made out of different kinds of wood. They look great and are showing the different kinds of trees in Sweden.\n\nInside the store, they are also selling Sweden’s best mustard – LissEllas. The question is if this store isn’t one of the best in the region. You are 100 percent to find something you will like and want to bring back with you home.\n\nAddress: Järnvägsgatan 2.\n\nOpening hours: Monday – Friday: 10.00 – 18.00. Saturday: 10.00 – 14.00.\n\nspringkällan\n\nOK, so at first, this might not seem like an attraction worth being on a list with 8 things to do in Rättvik. However, if you know a little about the history of this place it quickly becomes interesting. This is a place where a meteor hit, 360 million years ago. In fact, the whole area is today called Siljansringen. In 1869, they started drilling for oil in the area. They didn’t find much oil, but they ended up hitting a powerful spring with water.\n\nTo this day, the water is squirting out of the ground. During wintertime, it all turns into ice (and it probably looks amazing). During the summer, you can still see the water coming up. It’s cool and awesome and strange – all at once. There’s a bench close to the water where you can have a picnic and enjoy the scenery. To get here, you’ll need to go about six kilometers out of the city center.\n\nfricks konditori\n\nThis café is located in the heart of Rättvik. It’s very popular among travelers and all others during the summer. Their treats and sweets are very tasty and that’s the reason why we have included this café on the list of 8 things to do in Rättvik. It has been in the same place since 1994. But the company has been running since 1965. Their treats are both traditional and innovative.\n\nIt’s always fun when a place dares to experiment with recipes. And they do serve really good and delicious cakes and cookies. If you want, you can sit down in the café and have your cake with some coffee or tea. Otherwise, you can also buy the goodies with you and bring them back home. Fricks Konditori is well worth visiting.\n\nInformation about fricks konditori"
