Since then her tastes(and to some extent her vocabulary) have expanded and now include pickledherring in mustard sauce (senapsill), reindeer (ren) in tubes and cloudberry(hjortron) liqueur. She has an unhealthy fondness for long dark days but alsoan appreciation for the midnight sun. Sheâs made a meal for dozens of insectswhile hiking in Norrland and spent enough time exploring the nooks andcrannies of Stockholm to know the locations of several free public toilets.Becky also updated the Destination, Getting Started, Itineraries, Snapshot,The Culture and Food & Drink chapters.My Favourite Trip FÃ¥rÃ¶sund FÃ¥rÃ¶Itâs about 6 oâclock on a sunny afternoon, and Iâm trying, as an Sliteadult, to relearn how to ride a bike. (âItâs like riding a bike,â they Lummelundasay. Ha!) Iâve rented a three-gear cruiser that weighs at least Visby50kg and Iâm off to ride the Gotlandsleden (see p24), a bicycletrail that winds through the fields and coastlines of Swedenâs Sandhamnfavourite holiday island. I decide to head north first, so as notto risk missing FÃ¥rÃ¶ â home of Ingmar Bergman, whom Iâm Burgsvik Uggarderojrconvinced Iâll run into by chance. I donât see Ingmar, but I do Ãjasee some amazing countryside, including dozens of medievalchurches and a few spectacular, impossibly quiet beaches.

Itâs simple: our authors are independent,dedicated travellers. They donât research using just the Internet or phone, and they donât takefreebies in exchange for positive coverage. They travel widely, to all the popular spots and offthe beaten track. They personally visit thousands of hotels, restaurants, cafÃ©s, bars, galleries,palaces, museums and more â and they take pride in getting all the details right, and telling ithow it is.

I would start in StrÃ¶mstad with FjÃ¤llbackaa visit to the atmospheric stone ship setting and prehistoricgraves, frozen in time and utterly free from crowds. Other an-cient mysteries lie a short zip south down the E6: you canât goto this part of the country and not visit the stunning World Heri-tage rock carvings at Tanumshede. After these silent enigmas,a trip to Ingrid Bergmanâs favourite holiday village, FjÃ¤llbacka,gives you a rousing blast of seaside mayhem: watch the sunsetting from the balcony of one of Swedenâs most distinctivehotels.Â© Lonely Planet Publications.

Booking ahead for accommodation and trans-port within the country will cut costs a lot; and in the major cities, lookinto discount travel cards before you leave (see p314). Once you arrive, youwill find the cities easy to get around and well serviced by public transport,with almost everywhere accessible to wheelchairs.WHEN TO GODespite its northern location in Europe, Sweden isnât as cold as you mightexpect. The south has a year-round temperate climate and summer can bequite warm in the north. Sweden is at its best during summer and autumn(late May to September), but hikers and campers may wish to avoid thepeak of the mosquito season (June and July). Due to the countryâs high latitude, daylight hours are long in summer.MalmÃ¶ gets 17Â½ hours of daylight at midsummer, and Sundsvall hasconstant light during the second half of June, but you have to travel northof the Arctic Circle to experience the true âmidnight sunâ â in Kiruna, thesun remains above the horizon for 45 days, from 31 May to 14 July. Swedes are big on holidays, and even Stockholm shuts down for two orthree days around Christmas and midsummer, so plan accordingly. MostSwedes take their vacations from late June to mid-August, so hostels arecrowded, but this is also when most hotels offer discounts of up to 50%. Travel in winter is somewhat restricted and requires some planning aswell as serious winter clothing, but there are good opportunities for activi-ties like skiing, dogsledding and snowmobiling. The big cities are in fullswing all year, but the smaller towns almost go into hibernation when thetemperatures begin to drop (the notable exceptions being popular ski resorttowns like Ã re, and JukkasjÃ¤rvi, home to the Ice Hotel).COSTS & MONEYSweden has a very good standard of living, which means the travel experi-ence is generally high quality but it does tend to be expensive. Carefulplanning in advance can help reduce costs.

Itâs a classic of early English Romanticismand well worth a read. The reliably hilarious Bill Bryson predictably had an entertainingly dif-ficult time of it in Sweden, as described in two chapters of his Europeantravel book Neither Here Nor There. There are also a couple of good views of Sweden from within, includingSelma LagerlÃ¶fâs The Wonderful Adventures of Nils.

Hotels,restaurants and museums throughout the country can also frequently befound online. The following websites are useful for preplanning:An introduction to the Sami people (www.itv.se/boreale/samieng.htm) A good place to startlearning about the indigenous people of northern Sweden and the issues they face, which includeracism and habitat destruction.Smorgasbord (www.sverigeturism.se/smorgasbord/index.html) A comprehensive websitedevoted to Swedish culture, industry, history, sports, tourism, environment and more, produced bythe nonprofit FÃRST FÃ¶reningen Sverigeturism (Swedish Tourism Trade Association).Sweden.se (www.sweden.se) All kinds of useful information about the country, in a variety oflanguages.Swedish Film Institute (www.sfi.se) Loads of information on Swedish films and their signifi-cance within and outside the country.Swedish Institute (www.si.se) The Swedish Institute publishes the best academic informationon Sweden in English.Visit Sweden (www.visit-sweden.com) The official website for tourism in Sweden.\n\nP:12\n\n20 Itineraries CLASSIC ROUTES These three suggestions are popular travel routes that take in some of the classic highlights of Sweden. They can be adjusted or mixed-and- matched depending on how much time you have. AROUND THE CAPITAL & BEYOND One Week/Star t & End in Stockholm Start in Stock holm (p65), where mandatory attractions include the Royal Palace, Gamla Stan and Sk ansen. You can cover those in a couple of days if need be, which leaves an evening for enjoying some of the capital cityâs nightlife â try the clubs around Medborgarplatsen in SÃ¶dermalm (p79). On day three, take a boat tour to the ancient settlement on Birk a (p107); itâs an all-day affair. The next day, check out the spectacular cathedral and palace at Uppsala (p236), and, if your schedule allows, peek into the illuminated-manuscripts display at the old university library, Carolina Rediviva (p239). Wander around the burial mounds at Gamla Uppsala (p238), allowing plenty of time to explore the museum. Spend the rest of the day exploring the adorable village of Sigtuna (p111), with its old- fashioned buildings, cute cafÃ©s and atmospheric church ruins. If you fancy a drive, head over to GÃ¶teborg (p200) and explore the BohuslÃ¤n Coast (p217) for the last couple of days. Alternatively, you could stay put and sample further from the cultural smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord that is Stockholm.This trip takes you Arctic Circle through some of NORWEGIANSwedenâs most ac- SEAcessible highlights in and around the capital city.

Then head north towardsLake Siljan (p262) to explore the surrounding villages, which are famousfor being postcard-pretty and steeped in history. Donât miss the familyhome of noted Swedish painter Anders Zorn in Mora (p266), the townwhere the worldâs biggest cross-country ski race, Vasaloppet, ends. Toura copper mine in Falun (p259) such as the World Heritageâlisted, FaluKopparbergsgruva. Stop at Ãrebro (p251) to see the fine castle and towander through one of Swedenâs most beautiful parks before continuingdown through the heart of Sweden to GÃ¶teborg (p200). Spend a day ortwo in this engaging city, making sure to visit its theme park and takingtime to relax and enjoy the atmosphere on the Avenyn. Spend the rest ofyour trip exploring the craggy coastline and picturesque fishing villagesof the BohuslÃ¤n Coast (p217).

Fly in to Kiruna (p298), stopping to check out the Ice Hotel if the season is right. Take the train toward Narvik and stop at Abisko (p301), a hikerâs paradise. Spend a day or two explor- ing the wilderness, either along the Kungsleden or via any of the shorter nearby trails in the area. Expert hikers may opt instead to spend their mountaineering time in the more challenging Sarek National Park (p305). From here, head to GÃ¤llivare (p303) and catch the historic Inlandsbanan railway to Jokkmokk (p304), home of probably the best museum to Sami culture anywhere, the Ãjtte (p304). Continue on the railway through some of the most spectacular scenery in the country, stopping if your schedule allows at Sorsele (p306) and Storuman (p307) and Ãstersund (p292). From here, rent a car and cruise over to explore the breathtaking scenery of the High Coast, or HÃ¶ga Kusten (p282). Continue southward, aiming towards Lake Siljan (p262) and the surrounding villages. Stop to see Uppsala and Gamla Uppsala (p238) with a detour into Sigtuna (p111) on your way to Stock holm (p65). The wonderful capital city will hold your attention for as many days as you can devote to it. When itâs time to move on, angle southwest toward GÃ¶teborg (p200), then K almar (p124) with its enormous and fantastic Renaissance-era castle. Stop at the island town of K arlskrona (p133), which is on the Unesco World Heritage List. Wrap things up by exploring the vibrant southern towns of Lund (p171) and MalmÃ¶ (p162). Thereâs a lot of Arctic Circle Abisko Kiruna territory to cover in Sweden, but in NORWEGIAN Sarek GÃ¤llivare SEA National Jokkmokk a full month you can see most of Park its highlights by Sorselefollowing this top- Storuman to-bottom route.

Continue heading northwards and cross the Arctic Circle aroundJokkmokk (p304), which is a Sami cultural centre and home to the excel-lent Ãjtte museum (p304). If the weatherâs in your favour, branch off toKvikkjokk (p305), next-door neighbour to the rugged Sarek National Park(p305). Then push on towards GÃ¤llivare (p303) and up to Kiruna (p298).Swedenâs northernmost city is worth some exploring on its own, but italso has a charming neighbour in Jukk asjÃ¤r vi (p301), home to the famousIce Hotel. From here, you could dash over to Abisko (p301) for somehiking, or go straight north to the remote village of K aresuando (p297),on the Finnish border.

Once youâve got your equipment sorted, head north along the waterfront to catch the Gotlandsleden, the bicycle trail that circumnavigates the island. Follow it to the grotto at Lummelunda (p158), then continue northward past Stenkyrka and around to the inlet at Kappelshamn. From here itâs an easy morningâs ride to FÃ¥rÃ¶sund, where you can stock up on picnic items and catch the free ferry to the islet of FÃ¥rÃ¶ (p158). Thereâs a tourist information centre in FÃ¥rÃ¶ town, near another grocery store and cafÃ©. Take your time circling the islet, stopping at the gravesite of British troops who fought in the Crimean war at RyssnÃ¤s (p159) and at any of the beaches or harbours that strike your fancy. Your goal is to reach Langhammarshammaren (p158) in time to watch the sunset over the eerie rock formations. Head back to FÃ¥rÃ¶sund, and follow the Gotlandsleden signs southward, stopping first at the Bungemuseet (p158). At Slite you can choose to stick to the coastline or head inland through the Kallgateburgs nature reserve; the coastal route is lined with nice beaches, while the inland option passes through some lovely, pastoral countryside.

The situation is particularly acute in the capital. According to statistics published by the property-owners organisation FastighetsÃ¤garna, the average income of people living in central Stockholm is 25% higher than that of those who live in the suburbs. The corresponding difference in rent, however, is minimal â at the time of research, rents averaged Skr968 per sq metre in the middle of town, against Skr888 over the city as a whole. But even so the immigrant population is overwhelmingly moving to the suburbs rather than the city centre. The problem, housing experts say, is not so much that newcomers to Stockholm cannot afford central-city housing, but that they donât have the connections required to find the scarce properties available. Whatever the reason, the majority of the immigrant population is relegated to block housing in the suburbs. One unforeseen effect of this is that small centres of vibrant multicultural community life have consequently sprung up in places like Rinkeby and Botkyrka and themselves become destinations for central-city dwellers intent on exploring new cultures and artwork. Cultural centres in the suburbs, are, in fact, where visitors can find some of the most interesting cultural events in the city. Sweden joined the EU in 1995 with a majority vote, but since then public opinion for the EU has cooled, and in September 2003 voters decided not to trade the krona for the euro. At the time of writing, 85% of workers in Sweden belonged to a trade union. The unemployment rate was 6.5% of the workforce in August 2005, up from 5.9% a year earlier. The welfare state is the largest employer in the country. The majority party â the Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson, now in his ninth year of office â is already preparing for the September 2006 general election.

Tribes from central Europe migrated into the south of Sweden, and ancestors of the Sami people hunted reindeer from Siberia into the northern regions. These nomadic Stone Age hunter-gatherers gradually made more per- manent settlements, keeping animals, catching fish and growing crops. A typical relic of this period (3000 BC to 1800 BC) is the gÃ¥ngrift, a dolmen or rectangular passage-tomb covered with capstones, then a mound of earth. Pottery, amber beads and valuable flint tools were buried with the dead. The island of Ãland, in southeast Sweden, is a good place to see clusters of Stone Age barrows. As the climate improved between 1800 BC and 500 BC, Bronze Age cultures blossomed. Their hÃ¤llristningar (rock carvings) are found in many parts of Sweden â Dalsland and BohuslÃ¤n are particularly rich areas (see p222). The carvings provide tantalising glimpses of forgotten beliefs, with the sun, hunting scenes and ships being favourite themes. Huge Bronze Age burial mounds, such as Kiviksgraven (p182) in Ãsterlen, suggest that powerful chieftains had control over spiritual and temporal matters. Relatively few bronze artefacts are found in Sweden: the metals had to be imported from central Europe in exchange for furs, amber and other northern treasures. After 500 BC, the Iron Age brought about technological advances, dem- onstrated by archaeological finds of agricultural tools, graves and primi- tive furnaces. During this period, the runic alphabet arrived, probably from the Germanic region. It was used to carve inscriptions onto monumental rune stones (there are around 3000 in Sweden) well into medieval times. By the 7th century AD, the Svea people of the MÃ¤laren valley (just west of Stockholm) had gained supremacy, and their kingdom (âSvea Rikeâ, or Sverige) gave the country of Sweden its name. Birka, founded around 760 on BjÃ¶rkÃ¶ (an island in MÃ¤laren lake), was a powerful Svea centre for around 200 years. Large numbers of Byzantine and Arab coins have been found there, and stones with runic inscriptions are scattered across the area; see p107 for more details. VIKINGS & THE ARRIVAL OF CHRISTIANIT Y Scandinaviaâs greatest impact on world history probably occurred during the Viking Age (around 800 to 1100), when hardy pagan Norsemen set sail for other shores. In Sweden, itâs generally thought that population pressures were to blame for the sudden exodus: a polygamous society led to an excess of male heirs and ever-smaller plots of land. Combined with the prospects of military adventure and foreign trade abroad, the result was the Viking phenomenon (the word is derived from vik, meaning âbayâ or âcoveâ, and is probably a reference to their anchorages during raids).

By 1160, KingErik Jedvarsson (Swedenâs patron saint, St Erik) had virtually destroyedthe last remnants of paganism.RISE OF THE SWEDISH STATEOlof SkÃ¶tkonung was also the first king to rule over both the Sveas andthe Gauts, creating the kernel of the Swedish state. During the 12th and13th centuries, these united peoples mounted a series of crusades to Fin-land, Christianising the country and steadily absorbing it into Sweden. Royal power disintegrated over succession squabbles in the 13th century.The medieval statesman Birger Jarl (1210â66) rose to fill the gap, acting asprince regent for 16 years, and founding the city of Stockholm in 1252. King Magnus LadulÃ¥s (1240â90) introduced a form of feudalism in1280, but managed to avoid its worst excesses. In fact, the aristocracywere held in check by the king, who forbade them from living off thepeasantry when moving from estate to estate. Magnusâ eldest son Birger (1280â1321) assumed power in 1302. Afterlong feuds with his younger brothers, he tricked them into coming toNykÃ¶ping castle (p244), where he threw them into the dungeon andstarved them to death. After this fratricidal act, the nobility drove Birgerinto exile. They then chose their own king of Sweden, the infant grandsonof King Haakon V of Norway. When Haakon died without leaving a maleheir, the kingdoms of Norway and Sweden were united (1319). The increasingly wealthy church began to show its might in the 13thand 14th centuries, commissioning monumental buildings such as thedomkyrka (cathedral) in LinkÃ¶ping (founded 1250; see p149), and Scandi-naviaâs largest Gothic cathedral in Uppsala (founded 1285; see p238). However, in 1350 the rise of state and church endured a horrific setback,when the Black Death swept through the country, carrying off around athird of the Swedish population. In the wake of the horror, St Birgitta(1303â73) reinvigorated the church with her visions and revelations, andfounded a nunnery and cathedral in Vadstena, which became Swedenâsmost important pilgrimage site.1050s 1252 Unknown Viking scratches runic graffiti onto a statue in Athens Birger Jarl founds the city of Stockholm\n\nP:22\n\n30 H I S T O R Y â¢ â¢ H a n s e a t i c L e a g u e & t h e U n i o n o f K a l m a r www.lonelyplanet.comâThe brutal HANSE ATIC LE AGUE & THE UNION OF K ALMARStockholmBloodbath A strange phenomenon of the time was the German-run Hanseaticsparked League, a group of well-organised merchants who established walledoff a major trading towns in Germany and along the Baltic coast. In Sweden, theyrebellion built Visby (p152) and maintained a strong presence in the youngunder the city of Stockholm. Their rapid growth caused great concern aroundleadership of the Baltic in the 14th century: an allied Scandinavian front was vital.Gustav Vasaâ Negotiated by the Danish regent Margrethe, the Union of Kalmar (1397) united Denmark, Norway and Sweden under one crown. Erik of Pomerania, Margretheâs nephew, held that crown until 1439. High taxation to fund wars against the Hanseatic League made him deeply unpopular and he was eventually deposed. His replacement was short-lived and succession struggles began again: two powerful Swedish families, the unionist Oxenstiernas and the nationalist Stures, fought for supremacy. Out of the chaos, Sten Sture the Elder (1440â1503) eventually emerged as âGuardian of Swedenâ in 1470, going on to fight and defeat an army of unionist Danes at the Battle of Brunkenberg (1471) in Stockholm. The failing Unionâs death-blow came in 1520: Christian II of Denmark invaded Sweden and killed the regent Sten Sture the Younger (1493â1520). After granting a full amnesty to Stureâs followers, Christian went back on his word: 82 of them were arrested, tried and massacred in Stockholmâs main square, Stortorget in Gamla Stan (p83), which âran with rivers of bloodâ. The brutal âStockholm Bloodbathâ sparked off a major rebellion under the leadership of the young nobleman Gustav Ericsson Vasa (1496â1560). It was a revolution that almost never happened: having failed to raise enough support, Gustav was fleeing for the Norwegian border when two exhausted skiers caught him up to tell him that the people had changed their minds. This legendary ski journey is celebrated every year in the Vasaloppet race (p266) between SÃ¤len and Mora. In 1523, Sweden seceded from the union and installed Gustav as the first Vasa king: he was crowned on 6 June, now the countryâs national day. VASA DYNAST Y Gustav I ruled for 37 years, leaving behind a powerful, centralised nation- state. He introduced the Reformation to Sweden (principally as a fundrais- ing exercise): ecclesiastical property became the kingâs, and the Lutheran Protestant Church was placed under the crownâs direct control. After Gustav Vasaâs death in 1560, bitter rivalry broke out among his sons. His eldest child, Erik XIV (1533â77), held the throne for eight years in a state of increasing paranoia. After committing a trio of injudicious murders at Uppsala Slott (p238), Erik was deposed by his half-brother Johan III (1537â92) and poisoned with pea soup at Ãrbyhus Slott (p243). During the brothersâ reigns, the Danes tried and failed to reassert sover- eignty over Sweden in the Seven Years War (1563â70). Gustavâs youngest son, Karl IX (1550â1611), finally had a chance at the throne in 1607, but was unsuccessful militarily and ruled for a mere four years. He was succeeded by his 17-year-old son.

For an incredible glimpse into this period, track down Swedenâs 17th-century royal warship Vasa (commissioned by Gustav II in 1625), nowin Stockholmâs Vasamuseet (p77).PEAK & DECLINE OF THE SWEDISH EMPIREThe zenith and collapse of the Swedish empire happened remarkablyquickly. During the harsh winter of 1657, Swedish troops invaded Denmarkacross the frozen Kattegatt, a strait between Sweden and Denmark, and thelast remaining parts of southern Sweden still in Danish hands were handedover at the Peace of Roskilde. BohuslÃ¤n, HÃ¤rjedalen and JÃ¤mtland wereseized from Norway, and the empire reached its maximum size when Swe-den established a short-lived American colony in what is now Delaware. The end of the 17th century saw a developing period of enlightenmentin Sweden; Olof Rudbeck achieved widespread fame for his medicalwork, which included the discovery of the lymphatic system. Inheritor of this huge and increasingly sophisticated country was KingKarl XII (1681â1718). Karl XII was an overenthusiastic military adven-turer who spent almost all of his reign at war: he managed to lose Latvia,Estonia and Poland, and the Swedish coast sustained damaging attacksQUEEN KRISTINAQueen Kristina (1626â89) lived an eccentric and eventful life. Her father, Gustav II, instructedthat the girl be brought up as though she were a prince, then promptly went off and died inbattle, leaving his six-year-old successor and his country in the hands of the powerful Chancel-lor Oxenstierna. Kristina did indeed receive a boyâs education, becoming fluent in six languages and skilled inthe arts of war. Childish spats with Oxenstierna increased as she grew older; after being crownedqueen in 1644, she delighted in testing her power, defying him even when he had the countryâsbest interests at heart. Envious of the elegant European courts, Kristina attempted to modernise old-fashioned Swe-den. One of her plans was to gather leading intellectuals for philosophical conversation. Sheâsoften blamed for the death of Descartes, who reluctantly obeyed her summons only to die ofpneumonia in the icy north. Kristinaâs ever-erratic behaviour culminated in her abdication in 1654. After handing over thecrown to her beloved cousin Karl X Gustav, she threw on menâs clothing and scarpered southwardson horseback. Kristina finished up in Rome, where she converted to Catholicism. Contrary, curious and spoilt, accused of murder and an affair with one of the Popeâs cardinals,bisexual, rule-bending Kristina was a fascinating and frustrating character, too huge and colour-ful to do justice to here.

Gustav III (1746â92) curtailed parliamentary powers and reintroduced absolute rule in 1789. He was a popular and cultivated king who inaugu- rated the Royal Opera House in Stockholm (1782), and opened the Swedish Academy of Literature (1786), now known for awarding the annual Nobel Prize for literature. His foreign policy was less auspicious and he was con- sidered exceptionally lucky to lead Sweden intact through a two-year war with Russia (1788â90). Enemies in the aristocracy conspired against the king, hiring an assassin to shoot him at a masked ball in 1792. Gustav IV Adolf (1778â1837), Gustav IIIâs son, assumed the throne and got drawn into the Napoleonic Wars, permanently losing Finland (one- third of Swedenâs territory) to Russia. Gustav IV was forced to abdicate, and his uncle Karl XIII took the Swedish throne under a new constitution that ended unrestricted royal power. Out of the blue, Napoleonâs marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (1763â 1844) was invited by a nobleman, Baron MÃ¶rner, to succeed the childless Karl XIII to the Swedish throne. The rest of the nobility adjusted to the idea and Bernadotte took up the offer, along with the name Karl Johan. Karl Johan judiciously changed sides in the war, and led Sweden, allied with Britain, Prussia and Russia, against France and Denmark. After Napoleonâs defeat, Sweden forced Denmark to swap Norway for Swedish Pomerania (1814). The Norwegians objected, defiantly choosing king and constitution, and Swedish troops occupied most of the country. This forced union with Norway was Swedenâs last military action. INDUSTRIALISATION Industry arrived late in Sweden (during the second half of the 19th century), but when it did come, it transformed the country from one of Western Europeâs poorest to one of its richest. The GÃ¶ta Canal (p146) opened in 1832, providing a valuable transport link between the east and west coasts, and development accelerated when the main railway across Sweden was completed in 1862. Significant Swed- ish inventions, including dynamite (Alfred Nobel) and the safety match (patented by Johan Edvard Lundstrom; see p116), were carefully exploited by government and industrialists; coupled with efficient steel-making and timber exports, they added to a growing economy and the rise of the new middle class.1700 1766 Peak of the Swedish empire Swedish parliament passes the worldâs first Freedom of the Press Act\n\nP:25\n\nwww.lonelyplanet.com H I S T O R Y â¢ â¢ W o r l d W a r s & t h e W e l f a r e S t a t e 33 However, when small-scale peasant farms were replaced with larger con- Although not historycerns, there was widespread discontent in the countryside, exacerbated by textbooks, Vilhelmfamine.

Swedish neutrality during WWII was somewhat ambiguous: allowingGerman troops to march through to occupy Norway certainly tarnishedSwedenâs image. On the other hand, Sweden was a haven for refugees fromFinland, Norway, Denmark and the Baltic states; downed allied aircrewwho escaped the Gestapo; and many thousands of Jews who escapedpersecution and death. After the war and throughout the 1950s and â60s the Social Democratscontinued with the creation of folkhemmet, the welfare state. The standardof living for ordinary Swedes rose rapidly and real poverty was virtuallyeradicated.MODERN SWEDENAfter a confident few decades, the late 20th century saw some unpleas-ant surprises for Sweden, as economic pressures clouded Swedenâs socialgoals and various sacks of dirty laundry fell out of the cupboard. In 1986, Prime Minister Olof Palme (1927â86) was assassinated as hewalked home from the cinema. The murder and bungled police inquiryshook ordinary Swedesâ confidence in their country, institutions and lead-ers. The killing remains unsolved, but it seems most likely that externaldestabilisation lay behind this appalling act. Afterwards, the fortunes ofthe Social Democrats took a turn for the worse as various scandals cameto light, including illegal arms trading in the Middle East by the Boforscompany. By late 1992, during the world recession, the countryâs budgetary prob-lems culminated in frenzied speculation against the Swedish krona. InNovember of that year the central bank Sveriges Riksbank was forced toabandon fixed exchange rates and let the krona float freely.

Like any stereotype it has some which won the Grand Prixbasis in truth, but the national character is, of course, a good deal more at the Venice Film Festivalcomplex than popular myth suggests. that year. Two key concepts that anyone spending a substantial amount of time inSweden will come to understand are lagom and ordning och reda. Both arevital components in the mindset of the typical Swedish character. Lagommeans just right â not too little, not too much. A good example is mellanÃ¶l(medium ale) â itâs not strong, but not as weak as a light ale. An exceptionto lagom is the smorgÃ¥sbord. Ordning och reda connotes tidiness and order, everything in its properplace in the world. A good example is the queuing system; every transactionin all of Sweden requires its participants to take a number and stand in line,which everyone does with the utmost patience. An exception to ordning ochreda is Stockholm traffic.LIFEST YLESwedes are a friendly sort, though sometimes in a way that strikes out-siders as stiff or overly formal. The handshake is used liberally in bothbusiness and social circles when greeting friends or meeting strangers.Introductions generally include full names. Var sÃ¥ god is a common phraseand carries all sorts of expressions of goodwill, including âWelcomeâ,âPleaseâ, âPleased to meet youâ, âIâm happy to serve youâ, âThanksâ andâYouâre welcomeâ. Swedes are generous with their use of âthank youâ (tack)to the point that language textbooks make jokes about it. Most Swedes go on holiday for several weeks in the summer, oftenin rural or wilderness areas of their own countryside. The sommarstuga(summer cottage) is almost de rigueur â there are 600,000 second homesin the country.TRACING YOUR ANCESTORS Fran ParnellAround a million people emigrated from Sweden to the USA and Canada between 1850 and1930. Many of their 12 million descendants are now returning to find their roots.

POPULATION Swedenâs population is relatively small given the size of the country â it has one of the lowest population densities in Europe. Most people are concen- trated in the large cities of Stockholm, GÃ¶teborg, MalmÃ¶ and Uppsala. Most of Swedenâs population is considered to be of Nordic stock, thought to have descended from central and northern European tribes who migrated north after the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago. About 30,000 Finnish speakers form a substantial minority in the north- east, near TorneÃ¤lven (the Torne River). More than 160,000 citizens of other Nordic countries live in Sweden. Over 20% of Swedenâs population are either foreign-born or have at least one non-Swedish parent. Most immigrants have come from other European countries. The largest non-European ethnic group is made up of Middle Eastern citizens, primarily from Iraq, Turkey and Iran. Other countries with a sizeable presence include Poland, Chile and Somalia. There are also an estimated 25,000 Roma. Sami Swedenâs approximately 17,000 indigenous Sami people (sometimes known by the inappropriate term Lapps) are a significant ethnic minor- ity. These hardy nomadic people have for centuries occupied northern Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, living mainly from their large herds of domestic reindeer. The total population of around 60,000 Sami still forms an ethnic minority in four countries â Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. In Sweden, theyâre mainly found in the mountain areas along the Norwegian border, northwards of mid-Dalarna. The Sami people refer to their country as SÃ¡pmi. As in many countries with an indigenous minority, the history of rela- tions between the Sami and Nordic peoples is often a dark one. Since at least the 1600s, the Sami religious practice of shamanism was denigrated, and noaidi (Sami spiritual leaders) were persecuted. Use of the Sami lan- guage was discouraged, and Sami children were coerced into school to learn Swedish. Sami religious traditions are characterised by a relationship to nature. At sites of special power, such as prominent rock formations, people made offerings to their gods and ancestors to ensure success in hunting or other endeavours. Another crucial element in the religious tradition is the sing- ing of the yoik (also spelt joik), or âsong of the plainsâ. A yoik or joik is a traditional song of the Sami folk; an emotion-laden storytelling song. They were briefly banned as part of the suppression of the Sami religion, but are now enjoying a resurgence in popularity. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Lutheran Church of Sweden set up schools to educate Sami children in their own language, but from 1913 to 1930 the emphasis changed to providing a basic education in Swedish. Nowadays, Sami education is available in government-run Sami schools or regular compulsory nine-year municipal schools, providing identical schooling to that received by Swedish children but taking into account the Sami linguistic and cultural heritage.\n\nP:31\n\nwww.lonelyplanet.com T H E C U LT U R E â¢ â¢ S p o r t 37Sami Cultural Area & Dialects 9 SAMI CULTURAL AREA & DIALECTSDialects 5 6 71 South 82 Ume3 Pite 44 Lule5 North 3 LAND6 Inari 2 N7 Skolt I8 Kildin F9 Ter 1N ORW RUSSIA A Y SWED E N Generally speaking, the Sami in Sweden do not enjoy the same rights as Read the news from theSami people in Norway and Finland; this is partly because hydroelectric underground (mostly indevelopments and mining activities, that are of great importance to the Swedish) at www.swedenSwedish economy, have been established on traditional Sami land. .indymedia.org.

The domestic season runs from Aprilto early November. The national arena, RÃ¥sunda Stadium in Solna, a suburbin Stockholmâs northwest, has the capacity to hold 37,000 spectators. Swedish footballcoach, Sven GÃ¶ran Eriksson, has achieved fame andnotoriety as the head coach of Englandâs national team and for rumours ofseveral scandalous affairs. Perhaps the best-known Swedish football playerwas Gunnar Nordahl (1921â95), who helped Sweden win gold at the 1948Olympics, and went on to be the all-time top scorer at AC Milan.Ice HockeyThere are amateur ice-hockey teams in most Swedish communities. Thenational premier league, Elitserien, has 12 professional teams; there are alsoseveral lower divisions. Matches take place from autumn to late spring, up tofour times a week in Stockholm, primarily at Globen arena (see p100).\n\nP:32\n\n38 T H E C U LT U R E â¢ â¢ M u l t i c u l t u r a l i s m www.lonelyplanet.comListen to Swedish radio Sk iingvia the Internet at www Alpine skiing competitions are held annually, particularly in Ã re (JÃ¤mt-.sr.se. land, p295), where events include the Ladies World Cup competitions in late February or early March, and Skutskjutet, the worldâs greatest down- hill ski race (with up to 3000 competitors) in late April or early May.

Well-known Swedish skiers include four-time Olympic gold-medal win- ner Gunde Svan and giant slalom icon Ingemar Stenmark, who won a total of 86 races in the Alpine Skiing World Cup. O ther Swedish men have excelled at tennis, including BjÃ¶rn Borg, Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg (all three have now retired). Borg won the Wimbledon Championships in England five times in a row. Golf is a similarly popular sport in Sweden with more than 400 courses throughout the country. Annika SÃ¶renstam, ranked as one of the gameâs leading female players, hails from Sweden. Bandy, though similar to ice hockey, is played on an outdoor pitch the size of a football field and teams are also the same size as in football. Sailing is very popular, around Stockholm in particular, where almost half the population owns a yacht. For more on participating in sports in Sweden, see the Outdoors Activi- ties chapter. MULTICULTURALISM During WWII, Sweden, which had essentially been a closed society, opened its borders to immigration. For a time, immigrants were expected to assimilate into Swedish society and essentially âbecome Swedishâ, but in 1975 Parliament adopted a new set of policies that emphasised the freedom to preserve and celebrate traditional native cultures. These days some 200 languages are spoken in Sweden, as well as variations on the standard â the hip-hop crowd around Stockholm, for example, speak a vivid mishmash of slang, Swedish and foreign phrases thatâs been dubbed âRinkeby Swedishâ after the immigrant-heavy suburb of Rinkeby. Asians are predicted to constitute one quarter of all foreign-born resi- dents in Sweden in the near future. Many are Muslim, and some disturbing anti-Islamic sentiment has begun to crop up. In 2004, arsonists set fire to the mosque in MalmÃ¶, where one quarter of the population is Muslim. As hip- hop artist Timbuktu (himself the Swedish-born son of a mixed-race Ameri- can couple) told the Washington Post, âSweden still has a very clear picture of what a Swede is. That no longer exists â the blond, blue-eyed physical traits. Thatâs changing. But it still exists in the minds of some peopleâ. MEDIA Domestic newspapers are published only in Swedish, but a wide variety of English-language imports are available at major transport terminals and newsstands â often even in small towns. Nearly 90% of Swedish adults read at least one daily newspaper and most people subscribe for home delivery. Dagens Nyheter is a politically independent paper with a liberal bent, while Svenska Dagbladet is the more conservative daily; both are distributed across the country though based in Stockholm.

Lindgrenâsbook Pippi Longstocking was first published in English in 1950. During WWII, some Swedish writers took a stand against the Nazis,including Eyvind Johnson (1900â76) with his Krilon trilogy, completedin 1943, and the famous poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900â41), whosenovel Kallocain was published in 1940. Vilhelm Moberg (1898â1973), a representative of 20th-century proletar-ian literature and controversial social critic, won international acclaim withUtvandrarna (The Emigrants; 1949) and Nybyggarna (The Settlers; 1956). The powerful imagination of GÃ¶ran TunstrÃ¶m (1937â) is reflected inJuloratoriet (The Christmas Oratorio; 1983), which was made into a film,and Skimmer (Shimmering; 1996), set in Iceland during Viking times.Other recent authors of note include Torgny Lindgren (1938â), whosemagic-realist short stories and novels, such as PÃ¶lsan (Hash; 2004), areset in his native Norrland, and the popular Henning Mankell (1948â),whose novels feature the moody detective Kurt Wallander. The poet Carl Michael Bellman is perhaps the dearest to the Swedishsoul. Born in Stockholm in 1740, Bellman completed one of his best-knownwritings, Fredmans Epistlar (Fredmanâs Epistles) at age 30. Greek themes,SELMA LAGERLÃFâS SAGASelma LagerlÃ¶f (1858â1940) was an early Swedish literary giant. Two of her best-known works areGÃ¶sta Berlings Saga (1891) and Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige ( The Wonderful Ad-ventures of Nils; 1906â7). The latter, which is still frequently taught as a geography text in schools, hasgreat character portrayals as well as providing an illuminating portrait of Sweden as a whole. LagerlÃ¶f was a vocal opponent to the Swedish intellectual and cultural establishment. Despitethis, she received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1909 â the first woman to do so. DuringWWII she helped several German artists and intellectuals escape the Nazi regime. She donatedher Nobel Prize (made of gold) to raise money for Finlandâs efforts to defend itself against theSoviets. Working for freedom and human rights until the end, LagerlÃ¶f died of a stroke on 16March 1940.\n\nP:34\n\n40 T H E C U LT U R E â¢ â¢ A r t s www.lonelyplanet.comThe Swedish Film with references to drunken revelry and Bacchus, the Greek and Roman godInstitute has loads of of wine, are strong features in this work.

Sweden led the way in the silent-film era of the 1920s with such masterpieces as KÃ¶rkarlen (The Phantom Carriage), adapted from a novel by Selma La- gerlÃ¶f and directed by Mauritz Stiller. In 1967 came Vilgot SjÃ¶manâs notori- ous I Am Curious â Yellow, a political film that got more attention outside Sweden for its X rating. With a few exceptions, one man has largely defined modern Swedish cinema to the world: Ingmar Bergman. With deeply con- templative films like The Seventh Seal, Through a Glass Darkly and Persona, the beret-clad director explores human alienation, the absence of god, the meaning of life, the certainty of death and other cheerful themes. More recently, the town of Trollhattan has become a centre of film- making, drawing the likes of wunderkind director Lukas Moodysson, whose Lilja 4-Ever, Fucking Ã mÃ¥l and Tillsammans have all been both popular and critical hits. Fellow up-and-comer Josef Fares (Jalla! Jalla!, Kopps), who came to Sweden from Lebanon, focuses on themes about the countryâs growing immigrant communities. M usic Everyone knows about ABBA, but thatâs just the tip of the iceberg. Swe- den is the third-largest exporter of music in the world, and Swedes buy more recorded music per capita than any other nationality. Pop bands who actually sing in Swedish are few and far between. Who knew the Caesars (âJerk It Outâ) were Swedish? And what about Helena Paparizou, who won the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest for Greece with âMy Number Oneâ? Yep, sheâs a Swedish citizen. Other hot names in the pop world are Sahara Hotnights, the Hellacop- ters, the International Noise Conspiracy and the Shout Out Louds. Late- â90s radio favourites the Cardigans are aiming for a comeback, and recent chart-toppers the Hives are still going strong. Sensitive rockers Dungen are notable for singing lyrics in their native language, although they get just as much attention for lead singer Gustav Ejstesâs devastating cheekbones. Interest in Swedish folk music took off in the 1970s and â80s, thanks mainly to the Falun Folk Music Festival. Traditional Swedish folk music revolves around the triple-beat polska, originally a Polish dance. Ethnic folk music includes the Sami yoik and a wide range of styles brought to Sweden by immigrants from around the world. Swedish jazz peaked between the 1920s and â60s. The pianist Jan Johans- son (1931â68) succeeded in blending jazz and folk in a peculiarly Swedish fashion. Both Stockholm and UmeÃ¥ host popular annual jazz festivals. Although Sweden has never produced a classical composer to match Nor- wayâs Edvard Grieg, there has been no shortage of contenders. One of the earliest was Emil SjÃ¶gren (1853â1918). He was followed by the Wagnerian Wilhelm Peterson-Berger (1867â1942) and Hugo AlfvÃ©n (1872â1960). Opera flourished after the opening of the Royal Opera House in Stock- holm (1782). Opera singer Jenny Lind (1820â87) is known as the âSwedish nightingaleâ. Archit ec ture Apart from elaborate gravesites, little survives of Bronze Age buildings in Sweden.

During and after the Reformation, monasteries and churches wereplundered by the crown in favour of wonderful royal palaces and castleslike Gustav Vasaâs Kalmar Slott and Gripsholm Slott, which has one ofthe best Renaissance interiors in Sweden. Magnificently ornate baroque architecture arrived in Sweden (mainlyfrom Italy) during the 1640s while Queen Kristina held the throne.Kalmar Cathedral, designed in 1660, the adjacent Kalmar RÃ¥dhus andDrottningholm Slott (1662), just outside Stockholm, were all designedby the court architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. Tessin the Youngerdesigned the vast ânewâ Royal Palace in Stockholm after the previouspalace was gutted by fire in 1697. The late 19th century and early 20th century saw a rise in romanticism,a particularly Swedish style mainly using wood and brick, which producedsuch wonders as the Stockholm RÃ¥dhus (1916) and Stadshus (City Hall;completed in 1923). From the 1930s to the â80s, functionalism and the so-called interna-tional style took over, with their emphasis on steel, concrete and glass.Painting & SculptureCarl Larsson, part of an artistic revolution in the 1880s, painted some ofthe best 19th-century oil paintings in a warm Art Nouveau style. AndersZornâs portraits of famous Swedes and August Strindbergâs violentlymoody seascapes have also come to the attention of the art world. Thenature paintings of Bruno Liljefors are well regarded. Although there was an initially cautious approach to Cubism, some artistsembraced the concepts of surrealist and abstract art, albeit with their ownSwedish style, such as the rather bizarre âdreamlandâ paintings of StellanMÃ¶rner. Otto Carlsund was the driving force behind early abstract art inSweden. More radical art movements in the 1960s and â70s were influenced bydiverse sources including far left-wing politics, popular culture, minimal-ism and pop art. Carl Milles (1875â1955) is Swedenâs greatest sculptor and one of the 20thcenturyâs most eminent artists in this field. He once worked as Rodinâs as-sistant and his home in LidingÃ¶, on the outskirts of Stockholm, is a gorgeousmuseum (p82).Theatre & DanceKing Gustav III founded the Royal Dramatic Theatre, known as Drama-ten, in Stockholm in 1773, and interest in theatre and opera blossomed.Greta Garbo attended the Royal Dramatic Theatre drama school in 1922,and Ingmar Bergman made his directorial debut here in 1951. In 1773, King Gustav III also founded the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stock-holm, the worldâs fourth-oldest ballet company. Stockholm is home to theHouse of Dance, the Dance Museum, Kulturhuset and the Dance Centre.Modern dance can also be seen at the GÃ¶teborg Opera and the Dance Sta-tion in MalmÃ¶, with smaller-scale productions performed across Sweden.\n\nP:36\n\n42 EnvironmentSweden is a long-drawn- THE LANDout 1574km from north G eographyto south, but averagesonly about 300km in Sweden occupies the eastern side of the Scandinavian peninsula, and shareswidth. borders with Norway, Finland and Denmark (the latter a mere 4km to the southwest of Sweden and joined to it by a spectacular bridge and tunnel). The surface area of Swedenâs (449,964 sq km) is stretched long and thin. Around one-sixth of the country lies within the Arctic Circle, yet Sweden is surprisingly warm thanks to the Gulf Stream: minimum northern tem- peratures are around â20Â°C (compared to â45Â°C in Alaska). The country has a 7000km-long coastline, with myriad islands â the Stockholm archipelago alone has an extraordinary 24,000. The largest and most notable islands are Gotland and Ãland on the southeast coast, and the best sandy beaches are down the west coast, south of GÃ¶teborg. Forests take up an incredible 57% of Swedenâs landscape. The Swedes arenât short of inland lakes either: there are around 100,000 of them in all. VÃ¤nern is the largest lake in Western Europe at 5585 sq km. Kebnekaise (2111m), part of the glaciated KjÃ¶len Mountains along the Norwegian border, is Swedenâs highest mountain.

Illegal hunting carries a maximumprison sentence of four years. Most conflict between human and beastoccurs in the Sami reindeer areas: compensation is paid to the Samiwhenever predator populations in their lands increase. Wolves and wolverines are top of Swedenâs most endangered list.However, wolf numbers are slowly increasing, and there are now between70 and 80 of these beautiful creatures in Sweden, mainly in VÃ¤rmlandand Dalarna. The more solitary wolverine, a larger cousin of the weasel, inhabitshigh forests and alpine areas along the Norwegian border. Most are inNorrbotten and VÃ¤sterbotten. Brown bears were persecuted for centuries, but recent conservationmeasures have seen numbers increase to around 2000. Bears mostly live inforests in the northern half of the country, but are spreading southwards. Another fascinating forest dweller is the solitary lynx â the Swedesâfavourite endangered species â which belongs to the panther family andis Europeâs only large cat. Swedenâs 1000 lynx are notoriously difficult tospot because of their nocturnal habits. If you have no luck with wildlife in the wild, GrÃ¶nklitt Bear Park (seep268) has an endangered-animal breeding programme with large andnatural-looking enclosures.OTHER MAMMALSMore than any other animal, the elk (or moose) is the symbol of Sweden.The elk family is the worldâs largest deer, a gentle knobbly-kneed creaturethat grows up to 2m tall. Elk are a serious traffic hazard, particularlyat night: they can dart out in front of your car at up to 50km/h.

Musk ox were reintroduced into Norway in the late 1940s and herds have wandered into Sweden, notably in HÃ¤rjedalen county. Angry adults have a habit of charging anything that annoys them. Forests, lakes and rivers support beavers, otters, mink, badgers and pine martens. Weasels and stoats are endemic in all counties; northern vari- eties turn white in the winter and are trapped for their fur (ermine). Grey and common seals swim in Swedish waters, although overfishing has caused a serious decline in numbers. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of seals were wiped out by the Phocine distemper virus (PDV) after pol- lution weakened their immune systems. Common dolphins may also be observed from time to time. BIRDS Sweden attracts hundreds of nesting species and permanent residents. Some of the best bird-watching sites are the Falsterbo peninsula (p175), GetterÃ¶n Nature Reserve (p232); Ãland, including the nature reserve at its southernmost tip (p141); TÃ¥kern (p152); HornborgasjÃ¶n, between Skara and FalkÃ¶ping in VÃ¤stergÃ¶tland; and the national parks FÃ¤rnebofjÃ¤rden, Muddus and Abisko. The golden eagle is one of Swedenâs most endangered species. Itâs found in the mountains, and is easily identified by its immense wing span. Another dramatic bird of prey is the white-tailed sea eagle. Coastal species include common, little and Arctic terns, various gulls, oystercatchers, cormorants, guillemots and razorbills. Territorial arctic skuas can be seen in a few places, notably the Stockholm archipelago and the coast north of GÃ¶teborg. Look out for lovely little goldcrests in coniferous forests. A few spectacu- lar waxwings breed in Lappland, but in winter they arrive from Russia in large numbers and are found throughout Sweden. Grouse or capercaillie strut the forest floor, while ptarmigan and snow buntings are seen above the tree line along the Norwegian border. Sweden has a wide range of wading and water birds, including the unusual and beautiful red-necked phalaropes, which only breed in the northern mountains. Other waders youâre likely to encounter are majestic grey herons (south Sweden), noisy bitterns (south-central Sweden), plov- ers (including dotterel, in the mountains) and turnstones. See p55 for information about local ornithological groups. FISH & CRUSTACEANS Many marine species have been badly affected by ecological problems in the Baltic (see p47). Sprats and herring are economically important food sources. Among other marine species, haddock, sea trout, whiting, flounder and plaice are reasonably abundant, particularly in the salty waters of the Kattegatt and Skagerrak, but the cod is heading for extinction due to overfishing.\n\nP:39\n\nwww.lonelyplanet.com E N V I R O N M E N T â¢ â¢ N a t i o n a l P a r k s 45 Indigenous crayfish were once netted or trapped in Swedenâs lakes, but You can swim, and fishoverfishing and disease has driven them to extinction. for trout and salmon, in the waters by Stock-Plants holmâs city centre.Swedish flora is typical of that in temperate climates, and includes around250 species of flowering plants.

Southern Sweden originally had well-mixed woodland, but much of thishas been replaced by farmland or conifer plantations. Northern forests aredominated by Scots pine, Norway spruce and various firs. Hikers will find a profusion of edible berries, mostly ripe betweenmid-July and early September. The most popular are blueberries (huckle-berries), which grow on open uplands; blue swamp-loving bilberries; redcranberries; muskeg crowberries; and amber-coloured cloudberries. Thelatter, known as hjortron, grow one per stalk on open swampy groundand are a delicacy.NATIONAL PARKSSweden was the first country in Europe to set up a national park (1909).There are now 28 (see below), along with around 2600 smaller naturereserves; together they cover about 9% of Sweden. Theyâre set up byNaturvÃ¥rdsverket (see p47), which also produces pamphlets about theparks in Swedish and English, and an excellent book Nationalparkerna iSverige (National Parks in Sweden). Four of Swedenâs large rivers (KalixÃ¤lven, PiteÃ¤lven, VindelÃ¤lven andTorneÃ¤lven) have been declared National Heritage Rivers in order toprotect them from hydroelectric development.

Sweden has a good comes fromrecord when it comes to environmental policies. Industrial and agricul- hydroelec-tural waste is highly regulated, sewage disposal advanced, greenhouse gas tric sourcesâemissions low, and recycling extremely popular. The North and particularly the Baltic Seas are suffering severe pol-lution, eutrophication and vast algae blooms, caused partly by nitrogenrunoff from Swedish farms. As a result, herring, sprats and Baltic salmoncontain high levels of cancer-causing dioxins; theyâre still being sold inSweden at the time of writing (with a health warning attached), but willprobably be banned by the end of 2006. Overfishing of these waters is also a huge cause for concern, with codand Norwegian lobster on the verge of extinction. Fishing quotas mayhelp numbers return. Some 47% of Swedenâs electricity generation comes from hydroelectricsources, mainly dams on large northern rivers. However, there are asso-ciated problems, including the displacement of Sami people; landscapescarring; dried-up rivers and waterfalls âdownstreamâ of the dams; high-voltage power lines sweeping across remote regions; and the depletionof fish stocks, particularly Baltic salmon which cannot return upriver totheir spawning grounds. In 1993 the National Heritage Rivers were cre-ated to redress this problem. Nuclear power generation has always been a contentious issue in Swe-den. At a referendum held in March 1980, the electorate narrowly votedfor the phasing-out of the nuclear programme by 2010. One nuclear reac-tor has shut, but the remaining 10 are unlikely to close by the deadline,because of high costs and no viable alternatives (nuclear power currentlyprovides about 51% of Swedenâs electricity generation).Environmental OrganisationsNatur vÃ¥rdsverket (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; %08-698 10 00; www.environ.se; Blekholmsterrassen 36, SE-10648 Stockholm) Government-run central environmental authority,with an extensive and informative website.Svensk a EkoturismfÃ¶reningen (Swedish Society of Ecotourism; %0647-66 00 25; www.ekoturism.org in Swedish; Box 87, SE-83005 JÃ¤rpen) Promotes environmentally friendly tourism.Svensk a NaturskyddsfÃ¶reningen (Swedish Society for Nature Conservation; %08-702 6500; www.snf.se/english.cfm; Ã sÃ¶gatan 115, Box 4625, SE-11691 Stockholm) Excellent website oncurrent environmental issues.\n\nP:42\n\n48 Outdoor ActivitiesEnglish-language Sweden has thousands of square kilometres of forest with hiking and cyclingcoverage of hiking and tracks, vast numbers of lakes connected by mighty rivers, and a range ofclimbing in the Swedish alpine mountains â itâs ideal for outdoor activities.

HIKING Hiking is well loved in Sweden and there are thousands of kilometres of marked trails. European Long Distance Footpaths Numbers One and Six run from Varberg to GrÃ¶velsjÃ¶n (1200km) and from MalmÃ¶ to NorrtÃ¤lje (1400km), respectively. Nordkalottleden runs for 450km from Sulitjelma to Kautokeino (both in Norway), but passes through Sweden for most of its route. Finnskogleden is a 240km-long route along the border between Norway and the VÃ¤rm- land region in Sweden. The Arctic Trail (800km) is a joint development of Sweden, Norway and Finland and is entirely above the Arctic Circle; it begins near Kautokeino in Norway and ends in Abisko, Sweden. The most popular route is Kungsleden, and its most beautiful â and busiest â sections are in Lappland. Many counties have networks of easy walking trails perfect for day hikes, such as sections of the 950km SkÃ¥neleden (www.skaneleden.org). Multiday routes are found in the mountains and forests near the Nor- wegian border. The best hiking time is during the short snow-free season, between late June and mid-September; conditions are better after early August when the mosquitoes have gone. Overnight huts and lodges are maintained by Svenska TuristfÃ¶reningen (STF). Mountain trails in Sweden are marked with cairns, possibly with some red paint. Marked trails"
