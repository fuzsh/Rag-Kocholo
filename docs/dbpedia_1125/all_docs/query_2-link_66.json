        "text": "Right in the center of Mora, next to the church, is the Zorn Museum with the world's largest collection of works by the artist Anders Zorn (1860-1920).\n\nExperience virtuoso water depictions, pictures of folk life from Dalarna, nude studies, refined portraits and carved sculptures.\n\nThe spectacular concert arena Dalhalla, is placed in an old limestone quarry in the middle of the Rättvik forest. It fascinates both audience and artists, and few concert venues can compete with its magnificence and nature.\n\nThe place was discovered as if by chance in the early 1990s and is today one of Europe's most powerful and beautiful concert arenas. As a concert stage, Dalhalla is perceived as completely unique in the world. With its high, almost vertical rock walls, it provides a nice sound without disturbing echoes.\n\nPhoto: Gösta Broberg, Dalhalla.\n\nThe village of Nusnäs outside Mora is a popular destination for those who want to get really close to the Dala horse's origins. Nils Olsson Dalahästar has been manufacturing Dalahästar since 1928. Each horse is carved by hand and then given its characteristic mug painting by experienced craftsmen.\n\nVisit the production and follow every step of the process, from piece of wood to finished horse. In the shop there is a large selection of dala horses in different colors and designs, although the classic red horse is of course the main attraction. There are also clogs with gourd bits, handicrafts from Dalarna and gifts.\n\nAlso take the opportunity to paint your own Dala horse and try to imitate the original's kurbit pattern - or take the turns and create your own modern Dala horse."
