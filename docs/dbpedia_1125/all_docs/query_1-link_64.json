        "text": "Dalarna is an important province in Swedish history. In contrast to many other provinces, Dalarna was devoid of a noble elite, and foreign influence was small. Several uprisings against foreign and domestic rulers started in Dalarna. The most famous is the Liberation War of the 1520s, in which Gustav Vasa travelled to Dalarna to stage an uprising against the Danish rulers of Stockholm. The truth of his legendary adventures in Dalarna is disputed; nevertheless, they are commemorated by Vasaloppet, an annual ski race.\n\nIn the 19th century, Sweden's nationalist movement sought to define a Swedish identity. They perceived the folk culture of Dalarna, especially in Siljansbygden, to be purely Swedish, and it was elevated into an archetype (and, in some cases, stereotype) of Swedish national identity. Falu Rödfärg (the red paint typical to Swedish farmhouses) and Midsummer celebration are some Swedish icons originating from Dalarna. While the Dala Horse, dalahäst, has been a handicraft object since the 17th century, it became a symbol of Sweden only in 1939, at the New York City World Fair. This phenomenon can be compared to Bavaria, which is the origin of many icons of German culture.\n\nDalarna has a thriving pop music scene, with the Peace and Love festival in Borlänge, and acts such as HammerFall and Miss Li."
