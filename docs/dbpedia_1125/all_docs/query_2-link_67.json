        "text": "Where? Orange, France\n\nThe Roman Theater of Orange, famous for its historic wall in the centre of the stage. This wall dates from Roman times and was initially a venue for large shows. However, later on, it served as protection for inhabitants of Orange during the war of religions and for years the theatre was not used again.\n\nUntil..\n\nin the 19th century a big restoration took place and artists started to put on shows there again. Slightly different from back then of course..\n\nDavid Guetta and The Police, among others, have already took on the impressive stage of the Roman Theatre. And if you're not that interested in music, there are also guided tours you can join. But since you ended up on this blog, this probably won't be the case for you right?\n\n4. The Gorge Amphitheater\n\nWhere? Grant County, United States\n\nThe Gorge Amphitheater in Washington, also known as Champs de Brionne Music Theater, has won the 'Best Outdoor Music Venue' award no less than nine (!) times.\n\nWe suspect that it must have something to do with the view..\n\nWith annual festivals and concerts by Pearl Jam and Dave Matthews, the beautiful location is used to the fullest. And waking up with a hangover at this festival campsite is probably a lot better than at the average festival!\n\n3. Dalhalla\n\nWhere? Rattvik, Sweden\n\nThe open-air theatre Dalhalla is located in a former limestone quarry and this combination is probably the only one in it’s kind. The limestone quarry was in use until 1990 and reopened in 1995 as an open air theatre. Each summer, about 25 concerts of all genres are held here.\n\nThe quarry is 60 meters deep, 400 meters long and 175 meters wide and offers room for 4,000 visitors.\n\nWhatever artist it is, this location alone will ensure you of a very, very, special evening!\n\n2. SteelStacks\n\nWhere? Bethlehem, United States\n\nSteelStacks is located in Bethlehem and was originally named Bethlehem Steel, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the United States. Nowadays, the almost 10 (!) hectares area serves as a place where art, culture and education are central. The area is actively used for festivals and almost 1,000 artists can be admired here every year.\n\nWhen entering, you’ll immediately see the five blast furnaces that were used by Bethlehem Steel. This industrial look is incorporated throughout the entire interior of the music venue.\n\nWhat’s your favourite open air gig of all time?\n\nShare it on Live Music App Gigit!\n\nWhere? Morrison, United States\n\nWell hello, probably no surprise here. A concert at the Red Rocks Amphitheater is a dream getaway for many die hard music lovers. The venue is located between two hundred meters high menalites and is used as a music venue, as well as an open-air theater and outdoor cinema.\n\nIn 1983, the venue became widely known for the concert video of U2 called 'Under a Blood Red Sky', during the group's War Tour. After this, superstars followed one after the other. Think Pink Floyd or The Beatles, all under the watchful eye of 9,000 lucky people.\n\nShow us how wrong we are\n\nYou probably don’t agree with the list above, do you? Of course not, there is no such thing as one top list for everybody. So don’t hold back and show us how wrong we are. Download the Gigit app and share your favourite gigs!"
