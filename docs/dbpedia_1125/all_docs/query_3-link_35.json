        "text": "\"Gates Of Dalhalla\", the new DVD from Swedish melodic metallers HAMMERFALL, has entered the Swedish \"Music DVD\" chart at position No. 4. As previously reported, the set also landed on the German \"Music DVD\" chart at No. 6.\n\n\"Gates Of Dalhalla\" was released as a DVD+2CD and Blu-ray+2CD on November 30 via Nuclear Blast. The set will feature the band's extraordinary 135-minute 15th-anniversary show that took place on July 28 on the historic open-air stage Dalhalla, built in an old quarry near the small Swedish village Rättvik. The footage was captured by Swedish director Patric Ullaeus of the Revolver Film Company AB, who has previously worked with IN FLAMES, DIMMU BORGIR, EUROPE and LACUNA COIL, among many others.\n\nCommented HAMMERFALL guitarist Oscar Dronjak: \"The set contained 26 tracks and lasted two hours and 15 minutes, by far the longest and most comprehensive gig of our entire career! We played songs from every album and then some. There were lots of guests and pyros, and we had 80 Marshall cabinets and the big shield with the HF logo carved out in the middle hanging brought out of storage, all set in an extremely unique venue. You really have to see it to understand. This concert really captured the essence of HAMMERFALL live in 2012 very well!\"\n\nSpecial guests during the concert included original HAMMERFALL members Jesper Strömblad (IN FLAMES) and Mikael Stanne (DARK TRANQUILLITY),as well as ex-HAMMERFALL guitarist Stefan Elmgren.\n\nAdded Oscar: \"Everything concerning this release is special: the venue, the occasion, the setlist, the guests. If you are going to celebrate something, do it properly, and this is exactly what we have done. HAMMERFALL with extra everything, 100% live, 0% bullshit.\"\n\nThe setlist for the concert was as follows:\n\n01. Patient Zero\n\n02. Heeding The Call\n\n03. Any Means Necessary\n\n04. B.Y.H.\n\n05. Riders Of The Storm\n\n06. Let's Get It On\n\n07. Crimson Thunder\n\n08. Renegade\n\n09. Blood Bound (special guest: Stefan Elmgren)\n\n10. Last Man Standing (special guest: Stefan Elmgren)\n\n11. Fury Of The Wild (special guest: Stefan Elmgren)\n\n12. Drum Solo: Anders Johansson\n\n13. Always Will Be\n\n14. Dia De Los Muertos\n\n15. Steel Meets Steel (special guest: Mikael Stanne)\n\n16. Threshold\n\n17. The Dragon Lies Bleeding (special guest: Jesper Strömblad)\n\n18. Let The Hammer Fall\n\n19. När Vindarna Viskar Mitt Namn (special guest: Roger Pontare)\n\n20. Something For The Ages\n\n21. The Templar Flame\n\n22. Oh Fortuna (special guest: Team Cans)\n\n23. Glory To The Brave (special guest: Team Cans)\n\n24. One More Time (special guest: Team Cans)\n\n25. Hammerfall\n\n26. Hearts On Fire (featuring all special guests)\n\nThe \"Hammerfall\" performance clip from \"Gates Of Dalhalla\" can be seen below.\n\nThe members of HAMMERFALL announced in March that they were take an extended break immediately following their festival appearances this summer.\n\n\"It has been an unbelievable first 15 years, to say the least,\" said guitarist Oscar Dronjak, \"and now we are taking a pause to ensure that we have another 15 years ahead of us.\"\n\nThere will be no HAMMERFALL activities in 2013, but the band promises to return strong the following year. \"The plan is to use the year off to recharge our batteries and come back more vital than ever with a new album in 2014,\" explained singer Joacim Cans."
