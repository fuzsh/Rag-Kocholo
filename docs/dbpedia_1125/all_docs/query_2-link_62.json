        "text": "Swedish melodeath legends IN FLAMES have left another indelible mark on Scandinavian metal history: The band's own festival Dalhalla Brinner, which took place inside the venerable walls of Dalhalla ended as one of the most successful events the location has ever seen. With a ticket count of 6,029 visitors, the event was sold out weeks ahead, with success continuing on the night - the venue’s on-site sales record was smashed at just 7pm.\n\nSupported by ORBIT CULTURE, LORNA SHORE and TESSERACT, IN FLAMES delivered an extensive showcase of their remarkable career. Starting with gems like 'Scorn', 'Episode 666' and ‘Stand Ablaze’ (played for the first time since 1999), the band also previewed their new material with tracks 'State Of Slow Decay' and 'The Great Deceiver'.\n\nIN FLAMES states:\n\n\"After 'patiently' waiting for two whole years, we finally got to set fire to Dalhalla together with you all! The weather gods were with us and so were the metal gods. A big thanks to Orbit Culture, Lorna Shore and Tesseract.\n\nTo be able to create memories on our own terms, in magical settings, together with our audience, our crew, and other bands is a rare luxury that we do not take for granted. We are forever grateful and hope you will join us next time!\""
