        "text": "1991\n\nThe vision of Dalhalla was awakened during Pentecost in 1991. Margareta Dellefors, a former opera singer and radio producer who had long been searching for a summer festival venue, and Åsa Nyman, the former cultural director of Rättvik, “discovered” the abandoned limestone quarry. The location was ideal, far from any settlements and well shielded from disruptive noise from traffic and industry. The site itself was an experience for the eyes and ears, resembling a stage, Valhalla, drawn from Wagner’s world, in Dalarna – hence the name Dalhalla.\n\n1995\n\nThe audience capacity was expanded to 2600 seats. Parking lots adjacent to the quarry were completed, and a protected walkway down to the audience area was finished. The official inauguration of Dalhalla took place on June 21, 1995, with a grand opera concert. Swedish Television broadcasted the concert, and Dalhalla became known throughout the country. Foreign press also covered the event.\n\nDuring the summer, a few events were held, some by renting the venue to artists who independently organized concerts.\n\n1996\n\nThe association “Friends of Dalhalla” formed a subsidiary, Dalhalla Production AB, which took over responsibility for the operations. Dalhalla’s first CEO was hired.\n\nThe first trial performance of opera, featuring short scenes from Wagner’s “Ring of the Nibelung,” took place. The performance was a great success, even internationally. The number of programs during the summer was expanded.\n\n1998\n\nHåkan Ivarson was hired part-time as CEO and combined the role (for 3 years) with continuing as County Music Director for Music in Dalarna (MiD). Administration was expanded in collaboration with MiD, including a joint finance and marketing department. The first international opera collaboration, with the Latvian National Opera in Riga and “Nabucco,” was carried out. Dalhalla celebrated its 5th anniversary with an opera concert featuring Håkan Hagegård and others. The company Clas Ohlson celebrated 80 years with, among other things, a joint event in Dalhalla. The first concert with Rhapsody in Rock was held, and the high demand for tickets led to the concert being doubled. A large portion of visitors had to park their cars at Kullsberg’s limestone quarry and then take a bus back and forth from the arena.\n\n1999\n\nDalhalla Opera Festival was initiated, featuring five different productions: Masquerade, Nabucco, Turandot, Wagner’s Ring in a compact version, and an opera concert with the Royal Opera. Dalhalla presented a children’s opera for the first time: “Pelle Svanslös” (Peter-No-Tail). World-renowned tenor José Cura visited Dalhalla.\n\nThe season comprised 28 different events. During the autumn, Dalhalla’s stage and artist area were renovated, and on New Year’s Eve 1999, the new millennium was celebrated with a grand event in Dalhalla, including performances by a figure skating group with several ice numbers on the polished surface of Dalhalla Lake.\n\n2001\n\nHåkan Ivarson left his position as county music director to become CEO full-time at Dalhalla. The synergy with MiD in administration ceased, and instead, Dalhalla invested in its own administration.\n\nThe collaboration with Savonlinna continued with the performance of “Macbeth,” and the Estonian National Opera made its debut with “La Traviata.” The demand for Rhapsody in Rock increased each year, and during the summer, 8 concerts were held to sold-out crowds!\n\n2007\n\nThe Friends of Dalhalla association formed a new company, Dalhalla Förvaltning AB (DFAB), to broaden ownership of the arena. The municipalities around Lake Siljan, Dalarna County Council, and four private stakeholders became new shareholders in the arena company DFAB, which leases the arena to Dalhalla AB (formerly Dalhalla Production AB).\n\nThe Estonian National Opera performed “Carmen” and “Rigoletto.” A magic show was presented for the first time featuring Joe Labero, and Björn Skifs held 3 nearly sold-out concerts in a collaboration between Dalhalla AB and Music at Siljan.\n\n2008\n\nOn May 17th, 25 cm of snow fell in Dalhalla! The fabric roof over the stage, newly installed for the season and unable to bear the snow load, risked collapsing and potentially damaging the stage area. Quick action with snow removal saved the situation… The DFAB board immediately began work to find a new roof structure capable of withstanding snow and thus being in place year-round. Dalhalla Opera presented “Madame Butterfly,” “Otello,” and “Carmina Burana.”\n\nRhapsody in Rock, which had performed concerts in Dalhalla for nearly every season, held its 50th sold-out concert, meaning over 200,000 visitors experienced Robert Wells in Dalhalla! For this outstanding achievement, Wells received a small copper plaque from Dalhalla with an engraved inscription.\n\n2009 – A Milestone\n\nWith increased public funding and other project grants, Dalhalla could finally produce its own opera, the first since 1999. Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” was performed to fully utilize the arena’s capabilities, with several different stages outside the stage area and spectacular effects. The endeavor was a greater success than expected, with over 15,000 visitors attending 4 performances. An amazing attendance record for an opera at Dalhalla!\n\nA new permanent stage roof replaced the old sailcloth before the season, creating entirely new technical possibilities for the various events. Dalhalla can now also plan events at times other than the summer months, and on December 12th of this year, the premiere of the Christmas Concert with Christmas Market took place.\n\n2014\n\nAttendance record – 60,000 people visited Dalhalla during the summer, a 50% increase compared to recent years. ChorusNight with 300 choir singers kicked off the season, magnificent and beautiful. Led Zeppelin legend Robert Plant, with The Sensational Space Shifters, mixed Led Zeppelin hits and new songs. The Beach Boys skillfully surfed through decades of hits. “Chess in Concert” by Benny Andersson, Tim Rice, and Björn Ulvaeus, a world-famous and 30-year anniversary concert, was exclusively arranged for Dalhalla.

Travel restrictions are introduced, the maximum number of people in the audience during the summer is 50, and everyone is encouraged to maintain social distance. Creative ideas are born, and Dalhalla creates new events, inviting both Hemester and Dalhalla scenery.\n\nDuring Hemester in Dalhalla, a limited number of visitors are allowed to drive down with their own motorhomes and stay overnight in the limestone quarry. It’s an exclusive evening with a three-course dinner in the restaurant and the opportunity to visit the artist’s house and swim in the turquoise water, something that only the artists usually get to do. It becomes very popular! In August, Dalhalla scenery is held for the first time, an intimate concert where the audience meets the artist on Dalhalla’s stage.
