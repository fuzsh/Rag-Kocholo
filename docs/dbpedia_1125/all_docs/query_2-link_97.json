        "text": "Gyllene Tider did a second sold-out gig last night in Dalhalla. The weather forecast predicted rain for the whole day and everything went according to the forecast until Uno Svenningsson went on stage. By the time it was GT’s turn, the sky got brighter and there was no rain at all. We are so extremely lucky on this tour so far.\n\nSince the Saturday concert got on our Top3 list of best shows on the Hux Flux tour, I was curious if the guys & girls and the crowd could top it on a Sunday night. Per promised they would try. They were close, but for me it’s still the Saturday night fever that deserves a better position on the list.\n\nYesterday I mentioned some advantages of having a seat ticket. This time there was one extra. Between Uno and GT, we could still go to the bar and buy water / drinks. The bar had a view to one part of the backstage area and we saw Anders Roos preparing his camera, so we thought he might take a group photo in front of the magical rocks of Dalhalla. And that just happened, so we could see the gang coming out – Micke Syd being late, haha – and posing for the group pic. Looking forward to seeing Anders’s photo.\n\nWe kept our fingers crossed that for the second Rättvik show the gang changes something in the setlist and maybe either Chrissie or Billy gets back on track. Well, Chrissie found her way back, but Billy stayed at Malmö central station it seems. This wasn’t the only change though! After Puls, it should have been En sten vid en sjö i en skog’s turn, so when they started playing the next song, I thought something was wrong with the intro, someone surely messed it up. Haha. Nooo! It was Vill ha ett svar! This was the first time they played it on tour, except for the pre-premiere gig at Hotel Tylösand. Easy to please hardcore fans with these slight changes in the setlist! Thank you!\n\nWhen the guys got down to the tribute to their favourite Dutch band part and Per asked the audience if they remember the George Baker Selection, Micke Syd said finally, 3 people knew them from the 6,000 in the crowd. He was happy. Micke started playing and singing „una paloma blanca” and it turned into ojojoj-ojojojoj. The crowd was clapping and ojojing along. Then he thought he did his job, got up from his spot and walked away. Haha. But he got back behind the drums again in a few seconds, of course.\n\nTalking about Per’s ginger tea – the secret surprise mix that Micke Syd prepares for PG’s throat each night – it was now made by the help of Micke Nord Andersson who was born in the neighbourhood. Syd said it’s thanks to Micke Nord that he got his name, Micke Syd. And we could blame it on Micke Nord, if Per wanted to play for 4 hours last night because of the secret ingredient in his drink. We wish… haha. Anyway, Min tjej och jag was dedicated to Dalarna last night, partly because Micke Nord is coming from there, partly because the mother of Micke’s kids – who was in the crowd – is from Borlänge (also in the neighbourhood).\n\nBefore Tuffa tider, Per said the ukulele is the world’s sexiest instrument and if in winter you are on Costa del Sol, you can see Micke Syd playing Här kommer alla känslorna on ukulele there in the parks. Micke confirmed and said we couldn’t imagine how good it works on middle-age women and dogs. He suggested Per should come with him next winter, if he is free and play there too. So maybe next winter you could bump into Mr. G too at Costa del Sol. Haha.\n\nStanding up didn’t really work as well on Sunday as on Saturday. We tried it hard and when Ljudet av ett annat hjärta started, some hardcore fans in the first seated row – and some more in the audience who were releived they could finally dance – jumped up from their seats. Unfortunately, the Sunday audience was a bit lazy in the sense of moving more than just clapping, so soon the security guy came one by one to everyone and ordered us to sit back. Meh… Even during the first song in the first encore we remained seated, but in the middle of Gå & fiska! we tried to stand up again. Then more and more people stood up and then the security team lost it, they saw it was a hopeless case to make us sit again. Haha. During the second encore, the whole crowd was standing. När vi två blir en and Sommartider kicked ass and När alla vännerna gått hem sounded beautiful.\n\nThere were people in the audience in each section, who were probably rushing to the bus – or who knows what they had on their minds –, because they didn’t even wait for the encores. The couple next to me, for example, stood up after the medley and they wanted to leave. I told them the band would come back on stage again, they said they knew, but they left anyway. They enjoyed the concert a lot, so I couldn’t really get what they were thinking. They were not alone with this action. Anyway, most people stayed of course, I just won’t ever understand why you would miss the encores at a concert. 5 songs in this case. And then you blame the band for not playing Sommartider. Haha. Whatever. It was a fantastic show!\n\nNow 2 days off! Next stop is Karlstad on Wednesday.\n\nSetlist\n\n1. Gyllene Tider igen\n\n2. Juni, juli, augusti\n\n3. Det hjärta som brinner\n\n4.

När alla vännerna gått hem\n\nAll photos in the article by Patrícia Peres\n\nPer after the show:\n\nAnother truly amazing sold out show at beautiful Dalhalla! What a crowd! Unbelievable!!!\n\nBesides Halmstad, Rättvik was the second place that sold out very fast, so an extra concert had to be added to Gyllene Tider’s tour at the same place. Dalhalla in Rättvik is a beautiful venue, it’s really a magical place. Getting there on time is a bit tricky when you have an oldtimer festival in town – and that was the case during the previous years too, when either Roxette or Gyllene Tider played here. Talking about oldtimers, a blue oldtimer limousine that had a yellow sticker on, saying „2023 Gyllene Tider” arrived at the venue when we got there. It looked very cool.\n\nSaturday night, beautiful weather, an extremely amazing band and a wonderful crowd who were already loud and clapping along during Uno Svenningsson’s session. All these made it a night to remember and put Dalhalla on the Top3 list of the best shows on this tour so far.\n\nGyllene Tider had a gig here on their GT40 tour as well. Then I had a standing ticket, but the stage was so high that for me it made no sense to stand in the front, I rather walked to the back of the standing area and watched the show from there. So when I saw Rättvik is among the places where the band plays on this tour, I decided early on that I buy a seat ticket, no matter what. I wouldn’t be standing in the front when I can see only 1/3 of Per and can’t see Micke Syd drumming. Haha. Front row in the seated area would be perfect, I thought. And it turned out to be perfect indeed. It has its advantages and disadvantages of course, but you have to decide on your priorities. The advantages are: you can arrive late, your seat is fixed, you can see the whole stage. The disadvantages are: you aren’t close to the stage and you can’t stand during the whole concert. I felt the urge to stand up already at Gyllene Tider igen, but nah. I was rather „dancing” while sitting, together with other fans. But when Ljudet av ett annat hjärta started, no one could stop me and the front row fans, so we stood up then and fortunately, a lot of people in our section followed us. Unfortunately, a part of the crowd wasn’t into standing up at that moment and looked at the security girl who asked some front row people to sit down again. It didn’t really make sense, because more and more sections stood up when all the other uptempo songs came, so actually, that one part remained seated where the security girl intervened. During the second encore everyone was up on their feet. This made the whole concert experience even better. Well, Per promised in the beginning of the show that they would top their previous Dalhalla concerts with a best ever gig last night. Come back tomorrow and we do it again!\n\nBilly and Chrissie were not interested in this beautiful venue. Who knows, maybe at least one of them shows up on Sunday.\n\nDalhalla, just like Stockholm, also had screens on the sides. The Hux Flux sign was not placed on top of the stage, but on one side it was Hux, on the other it was Flux. It was funny when Per pointed at the roof when he mentioned the album title after Gammal kärlek rostar aldrig. He should have pointed to the left and right. Haha.\n\nBefore Min tjej och jag, Micke asked the crowd how many were here for the first time in Dalhalla. A lot of people held up their hands and Micke greeted them. He mentioned that they are very happy for everyone coming to their shows, but there are many in the front who are following them on several concerts. One of them is Liv, who is a hardcore GT fan and she is usually in the front row, but last night she also decided for the seats, because she was there with her mom. So Micke dedicated MTOJ to her and her mom and all moms. Lovely! Micke also spotted a guy in a golden jacket in the crowd and asked the cameraman to show him on screen. The golden-jacket guy stood up and he got a loud applause. Micke said he saw he also bought a T-shirt at the merch [the guy was wearing a Hux Flux merch tee], so they are very happy. Haha.\n\nBefore the second encore, the crowd started singing Sommartider and didn’t stop even when the guys and girls were back on stage. Per said they thought they would skip Sommartider and then they got a loud nooo from the audience. Per let them sing a bit more Sommartider, but then they started playing När vi två blir en and the audience went wild and cheered it loudly.\n\nIt was truly a most awesome show!\n\nNo rest for the wicked! Next stop is Rättvik, Dalhalla again on Sunday.\n\nSetlist\n\n1. Gyllene Tider igen\n\n2. Juni, juli, augusti\n\n3. Det hjärta som brinner\n\n4. Skicka ett vykort, älskling\n\n5.

När alla vännerna gått hem\n\nAll photos in the article by Patrícia Peres\n\nPer after the show:\n\nAmazing Saturday Gig in Dalhalla!!!! Wow!\n\nAfter 4 days off, Per Gessle’s summer tour continued and the gang played in Rättvik. Last night’s venue, Dalhalla is an amphitheatre located in a former limestone quarry, and is used as a summer music venue. Seeing a concert live in such a beautiful setting must be amazing. Per played there before, in 2015 with Roxette.\n\nThe audience were mainly seated, but in the front there was a little space for standing people. Still the stage was too high. Åsa was there and filmed a lot. Per already shared 2 great videos from the gig (1; 2). Anders Roos was also there again and took some cool pictures (1; 2). Fingers crossed for a nice photo book after the tour!\n\nAfter the first song, Min plats Per talked to the crowd and mentioned they played at this venue with Roxette in 2015. He also said he was writing songs for more than 40 years, which is unbelievable and on this tour he wants to play songs from all the branches of his tree.\n\nMost songs, like e.g. På promenad genom stan or Här kommer alla känslorna (på en och samma gång) were rather heavy clap and sing along songs in Dalhalla and Ljudet av ett annat hjärta was the one that made most people (from 5 to 90) stand up from their seats and party.\n\nThere was a little change in the setlist. After It Must Have Been Love the band played Listen To Your Heart. Per mentioned after the song that they rehearsed LTYH only during the soundcheck on concert day, so then they decided to play it. Unfortunately, the setlist didn’t get longer by this one hit, but it kicked Tittar på dej när du dansar off the set. We would be fine with having both of them, just saying.\n\nDuring The Look, Christoffer came down to the catwalk in front of the stage and was entertaining the crowd with his crazy guitar playing.\n\nPer about the Dalhalla show:\n\nHärligt gig igår i obeskrivligt vackra Dalhalla.
