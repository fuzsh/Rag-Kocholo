        "text": "Redesign of Dalhalla — A unique outdoor music arena situated in the middle of an old limestone quarry. The new graphic identity is a reflection of the surroundings of the arena, such as the geometric shape of a limestone and the quarry itself.\n\nThe occurring graphic element as background is inspired by topographic maps as a reference to the depth of the quarry. The incredible depth and rugged limestone walls are the reason behind the arena’s excellent acoustics. By highlighting these details in the rebrand we managed to create a new graphic identity that acknowledges the fact that Dalhalla is a unique place worth traveling to.\n\nThe new graphic identity includes a variety of different type of prints. From concert tickets and posters to a seating map of the arena. The core values of the rebrand being mysterious, exclusive and unique, helped shape the graphic elements and layout.\n\nAs memorabilia and added value to experiencing Dalhalla during the summer we created a limited coffee table book. The book contains information about the artists and is printed on different types of paper for exclusivity. The occurring design elements from the graphic identity can be found in the details of the book while still being seen as an individual piece. Every summer will have its own book named after the year it is published.\n\nBy having a well thought out design system, it became easy to translate how the brand is perceived in print to digital mediums. Social Media posts and Web Design each contain the same graphic elements we see from the prints — altered to fit in the digital world.\n\nDalhalla is my thesis project at Brobygrafiska created together with Emelie Westin,\n\nAnna-Karin Näsman and Louise Rodung.\n\nMy main areas of the project were Research, Concept, Identity, Map & Ticket Design,\n\nPrint Technician, SoMe Posts and Animation.\n\nBrand film song: “Penseldrag” by Mares, used with permission."
