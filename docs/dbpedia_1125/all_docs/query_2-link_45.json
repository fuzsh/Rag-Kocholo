        "text": "Gyllene Tider did a second sold-out gig last night in Dalhalla. The weather forecast predicted rain for the whole day and everything went according to the forecast until Uno Svenningsson went on stage. By the time it was GT’s turn, the sky got brighter and there was no rain at all. We are so extremely lucky on this tour so far.\n\nSince the Saturday concert got on our Top3 list of best shows on the Hux Flux tour, I was curious if the guys & girls and the crowd could top it on a Sunday night. Per promised they would try. They were close, but for me it’s still the Saturday night fever that deserves a better position on the list.\n\nYesterday I mentioned some advantages of having a seat ticket. This time there was one extra. Between Uno and GT, we could still go to the bar and buy water / drinks. The bar had a view to one part of the backstage area and we saw Anders Roos preparing his camera, so we thought he might take a group photo in front of the magical rocks of Dalhalla. And that just happened, so we could see the gang coming out – Micke Syd being late, haha – and posing for the group pic. Looking forward to seeing Anders’s photo.\n\nWe kept our fingers crossed that for the second Rättvik show the gang changes something in the setlist and maybe either Chrissie or Billy gets back on track. Well, Chrissie found her way back, but Billy stayed at Malmö central station it seems. This wasn’t the only change though! After Puls, it should have been En sten vid en sjö i en skog’s turn, so when they started playing the next song, I thought something was wrong with the intro, someone surely messed it up. Haha. Nooo! It was Vill ha ett svar! This was the first time they played it on tour, except for the pre-premiere gig at Hotel Tylösand. Easy to please hardcore fans with these slight changes in the setlist! Thank you!\n\nWhen the guys got down to the tribute to their favourite Dutch band part and Per asked the audience if they remember the George Baker Selection, Micke Syd said finally, 3 people knew them from the 6,000 in the crowd. He was happy. Micke started playing and singing „una paloma blanca” and it turned into ojojoj-ojojojoj. The crowd was clapping and ojojing along. Then he thought he did his job, got up from his spot and walked away. Haha. But he got back behind the drums again in a few seconds, of course.\n\nTalking about Per’s ginger tea – the secret surprise mix that Micke Syd prepares for PG’s throat each night – it was now made by the help of Micke Nord Andersson who was born in the neighbourhood. Syd said it’s thanks to Micke Nord that he got his name, Micke Syd. And we could blame it on Micke Nord, if Per wanted to play for 4 hours last night because of the secret ingredient in his drink. We wish… haha. Anyway, Min tjej och jag was dedicated to Dalarna last night, partly because Micke Nord is coming from there, partly because the mother of Micke’s kids – who was in the crowd – is from Borlänge (also in the neighbourhood).\n\nBefore Tuffa tider, Per said the ukulele is the world’s sexiest instrument and if in winter you are on Costa del Sol, you can see Micke Syd playing Här kommer alla känslorna on ukulele there in the parks. Micke confirmed and said we couldn’t imagine how good it works on middle-age women and dogs. He suggested Per should come with him next winter, if he is free and play there too. So maybe next winter you could bump into Mr. G too at Costa del Sol. Haha.\n\nStanding up didn’t really work as well on Sunday as on Saturday. We tried it hard and when Ljudet av ett annat hjärta started, some hardcore fans in the first seated row – and some more in the audience who were releived they could finally dance – jumped up from their seats. Unfortunately, the Sunday audience was a bit lazy in the sense of moving more than just clapping, so soon the security guy came one by one to everyone and ordered us to sit back. Meh… Even during the first song in the first encore we remained seated, but in the middle of Gå & fiska! we tried to stand up again. Then more and more people stood up and then the security team lost it, they saw it was a hopeless case to make us sit again. Haha. During the second encore, the whole crowd was standing. När vi två blir en and Sommartider kicked ass and När alla vännerna gått hem sounded beautiful.\n\nThere were people in the audience in each section, who were probably rushing to the bus – or who knows what they had on their minds –, because they didn’t even wait for the encores. The couple next to me, for example, stood up after the medley and they wanted to leave. I told them the band would come back on stage again, they said they knew, but they left anyway. They enjoyed the concert a lot, so I couldn’t really get what they were thinking. They were not alone with this action. Anyway, most people stayed of course, I just won’t ever understand why you would miss the encores at a concert. 5 songs in this case. And then you blame the band for not playing Sommartider. Haha. Whatever. It was a fantastic show!\n\nNow 2 days off! Next stop is Karlstad on Wednesday.\n\nSetlist\n\n1. Gyllene Tider igen\n\n2. Juni, juli, augusti\n\n3. Det hjärta som brinner\n\n4.

När alla vännerna gått hem\n\nAll photos in the article by Patrícia Peres\n\nPer after the show:\n\nAnother truly amazing sold out show at beautiful Dalhalla! What a crowd! Unbelievable!!!\n\nBesides Halmstad, Rättvik was the second place that sold out very fast, so an extra concert had to be added to Gyllene Tider’s tour at the same place. Dalhalla in Rättvik is a beautiful venue, it’s really a magical place. Getting there on time is a bit tricky when you have an oldtimer festival in town – and that was the case during the previous years too, when either Roxette or Gyllene Tider played here. Talking about oldtimers, a blue oldtimer limousine that had a yellow sticker on, saying „2023 Gyllene Tider” arrived at the venue when we got there. It looked very cool.\n\nSaturday night, beautiful weather, an extremely amazing band and a wonderful crowd who were already loud and clapping along during Uno Svenningsson’s session. All these made it a night to remember and put Dalhalla on the Top3 list of the best shows on this tour so far.\n\nGyllene Tider had a gig here on their GT40 tour as well. Then I had a standing ticket, but the stage was so high that for me it made no sense to stand in the front, I rather walked to the back of the standing area and watched the show from there. So when I saw Rättvik is among the places where the band plays on this tour, I decided early on that I buy a seat ticket, no matter what. I wouldn’t be standing in the front when I can see only 1/3 of Per and can’t see Micke Syd drumming. Haha. Front row in the seated area would be perfect, I thought. And it turned out to be perfect indeed. It has its advantages and disadvantages of course, but you have to decide on your priorities. The advantages are: you can arrive late, your seat is fixed, you can see the whole stage. The disadvantages are: you aren’t close to the stage and you can’t stand during the whole concert. I felt the urge to stand up already at Gyllene Tider igen, but nah. I was rather „dancing” while sitting, together with other fans. But when Ljudet av ett annat hjärta started, no one could stop me and the front row fans, so we stood up then and fortunately, a lot of people in our section followed us. Unfortunately, a part of the crowd wasn’t into standing up at that moment and looked at the security girl who asked some front row people to sit down again. It didn’t really make sense, because more and more sections stood up when all the other uptempo songs came, so actually, that one part remained seated where the security girl intervened. During the second encore everyone was up on their feet. This made the whole concert experience even better. Well, Per promised in the beginning of the show that they would top their previous Dalhalla concerts with a best ever gig last night. Come back tomorrow and we do it again!\n\nBilly and Chrissie were not interested in this beautiful venue. Who knows, maybe at least one of them shows up on Sunday.\n\nDalhalla, just like Stockholm, also had screens on the sides. The Hux Flux sign was not placed on top of the stage, but on one side it was Hux, on the other it was Flux. It was funny when Per pointed at the roof when he mentioned the album title after Gammal kärlek rostar aldrig. He should have pointed to the left and right. Haha.\n\nBefore Min tjej och jag, Micke asked the crowd how many were here for the first time in Dalhalla. A lot of people held up their hands and Micke greeted them. He mentioned that they are very happy for everyone coming to their shows, but there are many in the front who are following them on several concerts. One of them is Liv, who is a hardcore GT fan and she is usually in the front row, but last night she also decided for the seats, because she was there with her mom. So Micke dedicated MTOJ to her and her mom and all moms. Lovely! Micke also spotted a guy in a golden jacket in the crowd and asked the cameraman to show him on screen. The golden-jacket guy stood up and he got a loud applause. Micke said he saw he also bought a T-shirt at the merch [the guy was wearing a Hux Flux merch tee], so they are very happy. Haha.\n\nBefore the second encore, the crowd started singing Sommartider and didn’t stop even when the guys and girls were back on stage. Per said they thought they would skip Sommartider and then they got a loud nooo from the audience. Per let them sing a bit more Sommartider, but then they started playing När vi två blir en and the audience went wild and cheered it loudly.\n\nIt was truly a most awesome show!\n\nNo rest for the wicked! Next stop is Rättvik, Dalhalla again on Sunday.\n\nSetlist\n\n1. Gyllene Tider igen\n\n2. Juni, juli, augusti\n\n3. Det hjärta som brinner\n\n4. Skicka ett vykort, älskling\n\n5.

När alla vännerna gått hem\n\nAll photos in the article by Patrícia Peres\n\nPer after the show:\n\nAmazing Saturday Gig in Dalhalla!!!! Wow!\n\nImpossible, but last night we reached the tour’s halftime. 10 concerts done, 9+1 to go! The 10th GT40 gig was held in Dalhalla, Rättvik. This is definitely one of the most beautiful venues not only in Sweden, but in the world too. It is an open air theatre located in a former limestone quarry, and is used as a summer music venue. I’ve always wanted to see a concert there, but couldn’t manage until now, even if Roxette played there 2015 and Per 2017. The place is really beautiful and seeing the stage with that backdrop was amazing while the sun was still up.\n\nThe concert sold out very fast in February, but the show wasn’t just sold-out. It beat the attendance record in Dalhalla! 5926 people came to see Gyllene Tider.\n\nAfter entering Dalhalla, it turned out that some fans who bought standing tickets got armbands at the entrance, while others didn’t. We were informed after asking the security girls that we wouldn’t be able to enter the standing area without the armband, so we should go back and get ourselves one… Hm. I thought it wasn’t the first ever concert they organized there. How come the ticket controllers didn’t give armbands to the standing ticket owners automatically? Whatever. We still had some time until the inner gates were opened, so we could go back to the outer entrance (fortunately, we didn’t have to go back to the very first entrance) and get ourselves the armbands.\n\nSome minutes after entering, Micke Syd appeared in the backstage area, on the side of the stage, visible to us and we could see he was taking pictures of the venue. He had his parents, family and friends as guests for the Dalhalla show.\n\nAfter the inner gates were open and we rushed to the front row, we realized that this time it might not be the best place to stand. I actually got in front of the boxes, with the speakers on top of them and this with a very high stage meant I would have literally seen nothing. So let’s say, the venue is amazing, but not the most front-row-friendly place at all. Most of the front row fans still decided to stay there, but we decided to go to the back of the standing area and watch the concert from there. Those who stayed in the front row couldn’t see all band members during the show. Göran, Micke Syd, Dea and Malin-My were too much in the back of the stage to be visible. It’s disappointing to those who attended maybe this one concert only or just 2-3 on the tour. Now that I’ve been ”forced” to stand more in the back, I had the chance to see the whole stage picture altogether. The lighting Gyllene Tider logo on top of the stage, the screens on the sides and the whole gang at the same time. And I liked what I saw!\n\nActually, I can tell that for me Dalhalla was the 2nd best concert on this tour so far. (No. 1 for me is still Skövde.) It’s because of the venue, the band, the audience. Per probably felt much much better, at least that’s how I saw him. He was constantly smiling, bouncing around, stomping and his vocals were in shape again. The whole band put a lot of energy into this concert. The temperature was quite hot, even Anders left his jacket behind when he came back for the encore and Per and Micke Syd were drying the sweat on their faces with towels. Despite the hot weather, all the band members were very active on stage and provided us with top entertainment.\n\nThe acoustics of the venue is wonderful! The audience was amazing too. Already during Puls they were clapping loudly, they were singing along most of the songs and from Ljudet av ett annat hjärta those who had seats started standing up. During the uptempo songs they remained standing and during the encore actually everyone got up from their seats and were either dancing or just clapping and singing along. This… (I mean the sitting crowd standing up…) happening… in Sweden! I’m impressed! It was fantastic to see how the band and the crowd connected last night.\n\nRegarding the setlist, unfortunately, they skipped Det kändes inte som maj and Tylö Sun, as well as the first song in the usual first encore. But this time there was only 1 encore and the guys and girls played all 5 encore songs one after another. The setlist is shrinking. Not good, not good! I do hope this is only for saving Per’s voice one week after he got sick, so maybe from next week they get back to the at-least-23-songs-long setlist.\n\nÅsa filmed a lot during the gig. Both from the side and from the front. I’m sure Anders Roos took some extra nice pictures of the 5 Golden Guys and the 2 Golden Girls at this venue.\n\nWhen the concert ended and we went out to find our cars, the buffet next to the exit played GT songs and you could hear a lot of people in the leaving cars were still under the concert’s effect, listening to GT hits in the car. The old Gyllene songs sounded the best in the old-timers.\n\nWithout a day off, Stockholm calling!\n\nSetlist\n\n1. Skicka ett vykort, älskling\n\n2. Juni, juli, augusti\n\n3.

När alla vännerna gått hem\n\nAll pics in the article are taken by Patrícia Peres.\n\nI started writing this while sipping a cup of coffee looking at the lake Siljan with a big silly smile on my face and thinking life is beautiful. And that I wouldn’t change a thing. For various reasons (including a 12-hour journey by car/plane back home, work and exhaustment) it took some days to finish this article, but better late than never, they say.\n\nDalhalla, organisation, logistics\n\nRoxette played at Dalhalla, an amphitheatre in an old quarry nearby Rättvik, which opened as a summer stage 20 years ago. To make it more mystique, they say that a meteor fell in this area about 360 million years ago and I suppose that the name is an allusion to Valhalla, the home of the Norse gods. In any case, the place looks awesome, probably one of the most unique and interesting places to play or attend a show, not only because of the sound but the surroundings and nature. It all makes the experience special.\n\nUsually, there is a big separation between stage and the first rows of the audience, with water flowing in between, but for Roxette this was covered with a platform and seats were place on it, meaning the audience was much closer than usual. We guessed it was Roxette who wanted to have the audience closer, as they like to communicate with the fans. And that was a good thing. More about the audience below.\n\nOrganisation and logistics were also a bit… special. When we checked in at the hotel in Leksand (Rättvik was fully booked) they asked us if we were going to Dalhalla (was it that obvious?) and advised us to leave with loooooots of time ahead for two reasons: there was Classic Cars exhibition in Rättvik it would take us at least 1 hour to cross the city and Dalhalla is in the middle of nowhere, with a narrow road driving up a hill and the long queues to get to the parking / event can take up to 1 hour too. So we followed the advice and left earlier than planned.\n\nRättvik was indeed a chaos, but at least we enjoyed the (mostly) nicely kept old cars cruising up and down of Rättvik (we were told that this meeting is mostly just about that, showing off your car in the main street of the city). It felt almost like entering Grease movie. We left Rättvik behind us to get into the next chaos, in this case mostly because of the lousy organisation at Dalhalla. We arrived shortly before 6pm, the time they were supposed to open the doors. What we didn’t know is that the parking wouldn’t open until 6pm either. So cars just gathered in a more or less unorganised way in front of the gate, with no information or signs about that, nobody to guide and make sure cars stand in a row… I guess it says a lot when a fan ended up organising the car queue together with one of the workers because the others claimed “they only start to work at 6” (!). Parking was well organised, at least for the first/second row, afterwards cars more or less parked where they wanted.\n\nEskobar’s last show as Roxette’s guest (?)\n\nUnfortunately, it started to rain right before Eskobar, so this and the traffic jam to get to the venue were the cause many people were not in their places / seats when Eskobar started to play. The about 10 “hardcores” who were there agreed to make the best out of it anyway, and try to make a great last Eskobar show.\n\nSince it was Daniel’s birthday, we also decided we would sing Happy Birthday after the first song. And it worked out very well!\n\nRox on!\n\nAfter seeing the lack of enthusiasm of the audience, we hoped that people would cheer up and at least show some interest during Roxette. We decided to stand up no matter what, hoping nobody would complain, and it worked out just fine. Before the show, Atli from Sweden Show Security approached us and asked us just one thing, we could stand up if we wanted to but we should remain in our places and not go/run to the front. There was like 2-meter distance between the first row of seats and the aisle and we behaved (imagine that usually there are like 10 m or more separation between the stage and the audience!). Unfortunately, we were not allowed to the front during the last two shows, like it had been in Zurich or partly in London, would have been great to have another close-up The Look but well, security is security.\n\nThe audience wasn’t as bad as we thought, though. People next and behind us were standing up now and then, and even if it required hard work from Marie and Per and the rest to make people sing, it was loud enough.\n\nMarie was in a great mood, as one could see and hear her laughing many times. For example, during Magnus-Per “Have A Nice Day” story, Magnus didn’t refer to “Baladas en Español” but a very unique limited edition of a rare album, or when she made funny faces with Magnus or Dea. Or when she asked Per “är du med, Per?” She also enjoyed Chris solos a lot and did a lot of her “yeahs” here and there. At times it sounded like she had a cold, but on “Spending My Time” or “CBB” or “Listen To Your Heart” she left us all mouth-open.\n\nPer also joked about “Tourism”. When he mentioned “The Heart Shaped Sea” story, and that it was from Tourism, a few people cheered, and he jokingly say those are probably the only ones who bought it. The (few) hard-core fans also got lots of special attention from Marie and Per and the band. What can I say? Isn’t it just a great feeling when your favourite band knows you and makes contact with you?\n\nPelle was amazing on drums, improvising a couple of times. We’d love to hear more of that! Time for a long drum-solo? And Chris and Magnus just decided to run in the aisle from one side of the stage to another, which Åsa caputured on camera, as one can see here. Chris played Härjarevisan, a typical drinking song in Sweden, maybe as a hidden tip for the Swedes, to drink more and have more fun?\n\nIt was indeed a special and different concert. And we all had lots of fun, and the guys and girls on stage too. I already mentioned this before, but the concerts in Stockholm and Rättvik just confirmed it, seeing the band so tight, there is no way one can stop the band now. Let’s hope that what Per mentioned in his post is more dates! It’s just 3 shows to go in August (not counting corporate show in September) and we all are looking forward to the next schedule-trip-planning (not our accounts though).\n\nI also have to say, I realised in the last two shows that the setlist is just awesome. First Sleeping and Big L to get people in the mood, then a few slower songs where Marie just shines with her voice, then Crush and She’s got nothing on which are pure craziness and fun. Then it gets calmer again with Heart Shaped and Watercolours (it works much better with both songs), and then slowly going crazy and powerful again starting with Fading almost non-stop until The Look, despite the fact that It Must Have Been Love and Listen To Your Heart and a break are in between, the arrangements of the songs rock big time, so it feels like a guitar-party non-stop.\n\nPost-show\n\nPer wrote a very long comment, specially mentioning Eskobar:\n\nDALHALLA UPDATE: Yes, thank you! One of the most spectacular places we’ve ever played. Stunning! Beautiful!\n\nAnd thanx for making this sold out show very special. Rain in the air but we all jumped between the raindrops. Great vibes were certainly floating around at this unbelievable venue.\n\nThanx also to Eskobar who did their last show with us. They’re not only a great band but really wonderful people. Pls check them out in the future, they’re def worth it!!! And hey, they make really outstandng music!!\n\nSo, now we’re taking a live break for ten days or so. The studio is waiting and I have some birthday parties to attend…. No rest for the wicked!\n\nThanx all of you hardcore Roxers for showing up at so many gigs, see y’all very soon again. You’re the one who make a difference!!\n\nAlso…. got exciting news re next year. More details to follow….\n\nStay tuned.\n\nCheers, P.\n\nWhat a nice comment, especially about Eskobar and about the fans!\n\nTalking about Eskobar, fans loved to have them as support act and have started a page on Facebook to ask to have Eskobar as special guest for the (possible) tour 2016. It would be great, wouldn’t it? And judging by Per’s comment, there seems to be something going on next year, so let’s cross our fingers.\n\nDaniel also posted the day after that Marie had sung happy birthday for him backstage, lovely! Per also posted this picture two days later with the following comment:\n\nTHANX ESKOBAR for supporting us on the European Tour. A delight. Pic by Anders Roos.
