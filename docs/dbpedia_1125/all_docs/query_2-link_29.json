        "text": "Is there a bag ban at Dalhalla?\n\nYes, there is a total bag ban at all major events in Sweden. The ban applies to all Dalhalla events until further notice.\n\nThe bag ban applies to all types of bags, regardless of size, including handbags, cloth bags, and plastic bags. Exceptions can only be made for medical reasons.\n\nWe want to inform you that the arena does not have any storage facilities for belongings. It is also not possible to leave bags on the bus if you have traveled with the Concert Bus or Restaurant Bus to Dalhalla.\n\nWhat am I not allowed to bring into the arena?\n\nIt is a complete prohibition on bringing bags into the venue.\n\nWeapons or other dangerous items that could be used to harm the arena, its staff, or other visitors are not allowed to be brought into the arena.\n\nIt is not permitted to bring your own food or drinks.\n\nCameras, video cameras, and audio recording equipment are not allowed.\n\nUmbrellas, chairs/stools, items made of hard material (such as bottles, thermoses, and bicycle batteries), or bulky items like large bags are also not allowed.\n\nFor security reasons, there may be a security check upon entry.\n\nWhat is the age limit for the event?\n\nThere is a minimum age limit of 13 for most of Dalhalla’s events. The age limit also applies to those accompanied by a guardian and for breastfeeding infants.\n\nWe adhere to the recommendations of the Public Health Agency of Sweden regarding age limits for concerts, and this applies even when accompanied by a guardian. This is because exposure to high-volume concerts can be harmful to children’s hearing.\n\nFor events with lower sound levels or those specifically for children, different age limits may apply. You can find the age limit for each event on its respective page.\n\nHow do I pay at the arena?\n\nThe arena is cashfree, you can pay with a card.\n\nMay I smoke at Dalhalla?\n\nSmoking is prohibited throughout the entire arena and in all entrance areas.\n\nAre there many stairs in the arena?\n\nThere are many steps in the Dalhalla auditorium.

It is possible to walk down to row 36 without stairs, but the final slope is steep.\n\nI have difficulty walking, how do I get down to the arena?\n\nIn Dalhalla, the Arena Bus operates between the parking/bus parking area and the concert area. A one-way trip costs 40 SEK and is paid on-site with a card; it is not possible to pre-book the bus. Bus stops are marked with the sign ‘Arenabuss.’\n\nWe recommend that those with difficulty walking book seats towards the back, as the auditorium has steep slopes and many stairs. If you use a wheelchair or a walker, or require extra accessibility for any reason, you can book an accessibility seat by contacting us here.\n\nCan I leave the arena during the event and come back in?\n\nNo, exiting is equivalent to leaving, and you cannot re-enter. The ticket is only valid for scanning once.\n\nWhat happens in case of bad weather?\n\nDalhalla is an outdoor arena, and events are not canceled due to rain or wind.

Entrance is through Entrance A or Entrance B.\n\nThose who have booked dinner are allowed to enter 3 hours before the event begins.\n\nI have booked dinner at the restaurant. When am I allowed to enter?\n\nIf you have booked a concert dinner, you enter through the VIP Access entrance. The entrance for restaurant guests opens 3 hours before the concert starts.\n\nI have booked VIP Access. Where do I enter?\n\nIf you have booked VIP Access, you park at the VIP Access parking area. You enter through the VIP Access entrance.\n\nAt the entrance, you will receive your VIP badge, which grants you access to the VIP area. You are responsible for ensuring you receive your VIP badge when your ticket is scanned.\n\nI have booked a standing spot.

You are responsible for ensuring you receive your wristband when your ticket is scanned.\n\nAre there specific accessibility areas?\n\nThere are accessibility areas for those who use wheelchairs, walkers, or otherwise require additional accessibility. We cannot accommodate wheelchairs or walkers anywhere other than the designated accessibility areas.\n\nBooking an accessibility spot includes transportation from the parking area to your seat. There is a specific parking area for those who have booked accessibility spots, located near the bus parking. Escorts are welcome if needed, at a ticket price of a total of 100 SEK. The companion will sit, as space permits, on a chair next to the accessibility area or behind it. There is a bar and an adapted toilet in close proximity to the accessibility areas.\n\nHow do I book an accessibility seat?\n\nBook an accessibility spot by contacting us here.\n\nI can not walk very far, is there transport assistance available within the area?\n\nYes, the Arena Bus operates between the parking/bus parking area and the concert area. The bus stops are marked with a sign ‘Arenabuss.’ The bus cannot be pre-booked and departs continuously. The bus ticket costs 40 SEK for a one-way trip, and payment is made on-site. Only card payments are accepted.\n\nBefore boarding the Arena Bus, it is essential to ensure you have your concert ticket with you and that you are not carrying items that are not allowed at Dalhalla. After the concert, the bus departs from the same location where it dropped you off and then takes you back to the parking areas.\n\nFor those who have booked accessibility spots, there is a special transport service that takes you down to your seat.\n\nIs there specific parking for those who have booked accessibility seats?\n\nWe have a specific parking area for those who have booked accessibility seats. The parking area is signposted and located next to our bus parking, near Entrance B.

Ticket checks and security screening will be conducted during the transportation process.\n\nIf I have mobility issues but do not need an accessibility spot, what should I do?\n\nFor those who have difficulty walking but do not require an accessibility seat, we recommend booking a seat towards the back of the auditorium. The auditorium in Dalhalla is steep with many stairs.\n\nEveryone has the opportunity to take the Arena Bus up and down in the arena. It costs 40 SEK per trip, and payment is made on-site.\n\nFrom the Arena Bus drop-off to the auditorium, it is approximately 200 meters without stairs.\n\nI have not booked an accessibility seat, but I have a disabled parking permit.

The QR code can only be used once, which means any duplicates will be denied entry.\n\nIt's not my name on the ticket, could that be a problem?\n\nTickets to our events are not personal unless otherwise clearly specified in the event information and can be transferred to a family member if desired. However, make sure you have access to the original buyer’s details in case the ticket is lost or if any unforeseen issues arise at the entrance.\n\nCan the ticket be scanned from the mobile phone?\n\nYou can show your ticket on your mobile phone; there’s no need to have it in printed format. However, ensure that your mobile screen is undamaged. Also, be aware that the connection might be unreliable at the arena, download the ticket locally on your phone before heading to the venue.\n\nIf you have lost your ticket, what should you do?\n\nYour ticket is a valuable document, and lost or stolen tickets will not be replaced.
