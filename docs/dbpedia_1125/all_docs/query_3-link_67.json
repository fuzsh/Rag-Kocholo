        "text": "SWC/Barry Stubbs over at No Badger Required is currently in the middle of a series about the Olympics. As you might expect, the posts are very well crafted, packed with personal anecdotes that will inevitably crack a smile from even the most stone-faced person on the planet, always accompanied by a selection of interesting tunes taken from all sorts of genres.\n\nHis post about swimming got me thinking that I probably had more than enough tunes on the hard drive to come up with some sort of half-decent ICA. Feel free to dive in and enjoy, while noting some of them did feature on the post over at NBD.\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. Swim – Madder Rose\n\nMadder Rose, from New York City, released four albums of decent enough indie-pop in the 90s and then, like so many of their peers, reformed a few decades later to take advantage of the fact that so many of their original fans had got to a stage in life when their circumstances meant they had a bit mote disposable income to spend on new music and going to see them play live again after such a long hiatus.\n\nSwim, which was also released as a single in 1993, can be found on the debut album Bring It Down. I am a bit of a sucker for the way Mary Lorson delivers her vocal in such a dreamy and understated way, and is something of a perfect fit for the tune written by the band’s guitarist, Billy Coté\n\n2. The Blue Line – Out of The Swim\n\nA four-piece band from Falkirk, an industrial town located halfway between Glasgow and Edinburgh with an uncanny ability to produce a ridiculous amount of talented musicians, writers and authors. This is the opening track from the album Rescue Therapy, released on Last Night From Glasgow in 2022.\n\n3. Swim Until You Can’t See Land – Frightened Rabbit\n\nThought long and hard about this. Still find it occasionally difficult to listen to some of the Frightened Rabbit songs in the aftermath of singer Scott Hutchison‘s suicide back in 2018, with this one being down to the fact that having last been seen walking towards a road bridge spanning the Firth of Forth, his body was found on the banks of the river.\n\nBut then again, this is not a song about death/suicide. Scott, in an interview at the time of the release of the album The Winter of Mixed Drinks (2010) said it was inspired by a Ben Kingsley film, The Wackness.\n\n“There’s a scene in it which Kingsley’s character goes down to the sea and starts swimming and swimming. I think he’s trying to kill himself, but he gets so far and realises he’d rather come back. ‘Swim Until You Can’t See Land’ was the title I had in my mind before I even started writing the album; I was becoming more and more interested in the idea of a rejection of the habits and behaviour most people see as normal, and in turn embracing a certain madness. It’s about losing your mind in order to reset the mind and the body. Forget what’s gone before and wash it out. This is not necessarily a geographical journey, as the ‘swim’ can involve any activity in which you can lose yourself. It’s a good introduction to the record, as the theme unravels therein.”\n\n4. Swimming Pools (Drank) – Kendrick Lamar\n\nFrom the 2012 album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. As someone else has so eloquently said elsewhere on t’internet, ‘What sounds like a club anthem is actually an introspective take on the social pressure and self-defeating attitudes that drive people to drink.’\n\nIt’s an immense piece of music.\n\n5. Nightswimming – R.E.M.\n\nThe beautiful and haunting piano-led one from the multi-multi-multi million selling Automatic For The People (1992).\n\nIt’s a lovely piece of music.\n\nSIDE B\n\n1. Swimming Pool, Movie Stars – The Wedding Present\n\nI’m fully expecting to hear this played live this coming Friday night when myself and Rachel make our way down to Brighton to get ourselves along to the 2024 edition of ‘At The Edge Of The Sea’, the annual two-day festival curated by David Gedge at which both his bands will be performing. The Wedding Present live shows this year have been to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of Watusi….thus the levels of expectation!\n\n2. Let’s Go Swimming – Allo Darlin’\n\nSoft-centred indie-pop of the finest type. From the band’s eponymous debut album, released back in 2010. They’ve been away for along while, but a new album has been recorded and with a bit of luck it’ll see the light of day before the year is out.\n\n3. Sink Or Swim – The Delgados\n\nUniversal Audio was the fifth and final studio album to be released by The Delgados. It’s hard to believe that it was fully 20 years ago. I had hoped, when they reformed and played the live shows in 2022/23, that it might somehow lead to new material. But with two members of the band now immersed in making a living in occupations that have nothing to do with music, I have to accept it was always going to be a forlorn hope.\n\n4. Cloudbusting Lovesong – Swimmer One\n\nSwimmer One were an Edinburgh-based group, formed by Hamish Brown and Andrew Eaton-Lewis in 2002, with Laura Cameron Lewis joining the line-up in 2007, with their music really being an electronica take on indie. There were two albums and a handful of singles before they called it a day in 2013.\n\nThis is a one half of a double-A released in 2006 single – I don’t have said single, only discovering it years later via t’internet. It’s a very intriguing take on the Kate Bush song, which then segues into one by The Cure. Dating from 2006 means it was recorded prior to Laura joining the band, and the female vocal on this occasion is courtesy of Cora Bissett, who has been mentioned before, being the lead singer in Darlingheart and whose theatrical show What Girls Are Made Of was reviewed on the blog back in 2019.\n\n5. Swim For Health – Ballboy\n\nSide A of this ICA finished with a beautiful and haunting ballad…..and likewise Side B. If anything, this one is even more beautiful and haunting.\n\nThis was originally released on the Girls Are Better Than Boys EP in 2001, and later included on the album Club Anthems, released the same year.\n\nJC\n\nA GUEST POST by JONNY THE FRIENDLY LAWYER (aka fiktiv)\n\nJC writes…………………..\n\nThis was meant to appear last month, to commemorate the fact that myself and Rachel were heading to Los Angeles, and in particular to Santa Monica, where we were to be the houseguests of Jonny (JTFL aka fiktiv) and Lisa (aka GTFP) for the best part of 2 weeks. It was a trip that had been long in the planning – it was supposed to have happened a few years ago but the COVID restrictions put paid to that, and then a few other things prevented it being rearranged until June 2024.\n\nMy bout of sudden illness and hospitalisation ended our hopes this time around. We had looked about trying to head over sometime later this summer or perhaps the autumn, but after a couple of transatlantic FaceTime chats, the decision was taken to leave it till next year.\n\nThere is no way I want to sit on this ICA for that amount of time. Jonny put a lot of time and effort into planning things for our time over there – for example (and I only found out about this afterwards) is that the evening of my birthday would be spent at a gig at the famous and historical Greek Theatre in LA, where Elvis Costello was performing…..and the seats were just about the best in the house. I’ve no doubt that his and Lisa’s ideas for the rest of our time over there would have seen us pop by a few of the neighbourhoods mentioned in the ICA.\n\nFingers crossed for third time lucky. Here’s Jonny…….\n\nThe Villains are coming to L.A.!\n\nIn anticipation of that historic visit here’s a welcome-to-the-coast ICA. There are way too many great songs about Los Angeles to choose from—the wonderful weather out here, famous streets (Ventura Highway, Blue Jay Way, Mulholland Drive), the culture (Celluloid Heroes, Nobody Walks in LA, Left My Wallet in El Segundo) and so forth. There are countless songs simply called “Los Angeles.” So, as to not get lost in the stars, I’m limiting this compilation to tracks titled after particular neighborhoods in the City of Angels.\n\n1. Santa Monica – Everclear\n\nI think of myself as a New Yorker, and I don’t see that ever changing. But I’ve lived the past 33 years in Santa Monica—twice as long as I lived in New York and more than three times longer than I lived in Manhattan. And I’m here for good. As Best Coast sing, “We’ve got the ocean, got the babes, got the sun, we’ve got the waves. Why would you live anywhere else?”\n\n2. Pacific Palisades – Ash\n\nThe Palisades is a town on the coast immediately north of Santa Monica. It’s where GTFP went to high school (classmate: Susanna Hoffs), 10 years after Sparks’ Russell Mael was quarterback of the football team. Not sure how a Northern Irish outfit came to write about the Palisades–it’s like a band from New Jersey singing about Bellshill or something.\n\n3. Malibu – Hole\n\nLet’s continue north to the next town. Everyone’s heard of Malibu, right? It’s impossibly beautiful, with the mountains on one side of Pacific Coast Highway and shockingly expensive beach homes on the other side. I imagine that when out-of-state or foreign folks think of California they’re picturing Malibu.\n\n4. Redondo Beach – Patti Smith\n\nNow we’ll head the other way south down the coast to Redondo, just on the other side of Venice. I cycle through it a couple of times a week. I’m on the lookout for dolphins but my riding buddies are keeping track of the surf. They have more terms for waves than Inuit folks have for snow. A reggae-ish number with tragic lyrics by the punk high priestess, from way back in 1975.\n\n5. Hollywood – Runaways\n\nFolks have been singing songs about Hollywood forever but this one’s my favorite, belted out by an 18-year-old Joan Jett. Everyone knows what happened to Jett and the Currie sisters and Lita Ford. But I like that bassist Jackie Fox, who co-wrote the song and sings the pretty background vocals, ditched the band when she was still a teenager, went to college and eventually to Harvard law school (classmate: Barack Obama).\n\n6. North Hollywood – Van Hunt\n\nThere are distinct parts of Hollywood: Hollywood proper, East, West and North Hollywood (there’s no South Hollywood). West Hollywood has the clubs (The Whiskey, Troubadour, The Roxy, Viper Room), East Hollywood is racially diverse, except for the massive Scientology facility there. North Hollywood is where it creeps over the Santa Monica mountains into the San Fernando Valley. The Valley is to L.A. what Jersey is to NYC. I like how people out here are dedicated to their discreet little patches. This song by neo soul merchant Van Hunt was in heavy rotation in the house while my son was getting ready to swap the SaMo sunshine for Chicago winters.\n\n7. Bel Air – Lana Del Rey\n\nI came late to the LDR party but got there in the end thanks to my daughter. Jane does her best to make sure I don’t only listen to music recorded in 1979. Bel Air is a super posh residential neighborhood just west of the UCLA campus. It’s filled with zillionaires with Beyoncé level money. Some of GTFP’s parents’ friends live there and they threw us a party when we got engaged. Cost more than our wedding.\n\n8. Beverly Hills – Weezer\n\nYou probably already know about Beverly Hills, part of the so-called “Platinum Triangle” (with Bel Air and Holmby Hills, where the Playboy Mansion is). I worked there for a few years. I didn’t really like it, but at least it has its own distinctive personality. Weezer‘s song gets the call because it’s got that fat wah-wah solo halfway through.\n\n9. Laurel Canyon – The Church\n\nIn the 60’s, Laurel Canyon was LA’s bohemian hideout. It’s where celebrated hippies and freaks like Zappa, Jim Morrison, Joni Mitchell, the Byrds, Gram Parsons and numerous other suede/denim longhairs lived. It’s smack in the middle of town, in the hilly part of the city separating West Hollywood from the Valley. Nepomusician Jakob Dylan did a film about it a couple of years ago. Not a great flick, but a bit of it was shot at TrueTone Records—the best guitar shop in the city. No idea why an Australian band wrote a song about it in 2014.\n\n10. Silverlake – Eagles of Death Metal\n\nSilverlake was hipster central when this song was recorded, and EoDM take aim at that crowd pretty mercilessly. But it used to have a great scene centered around a club called Spaceland, where bands like the Sugarplastic, The 88, Baby Lemonade, Silversun Pickups, Foster the People, the Wondermints and others reinvented power pop. Hipster ground zero has since shifted east to more affordable places like Eagle Rock and Highland Park, so Silverlake is fun to go to again.\n\nIt’s going to be a great visit.\n\nBonus Track: Best Coast – The Only Place\n\nBonus video: As mentioned, there are countless songs titled Los Angeles but, in the end, there’s really only one that counts. My cover band got to play it at the notorious Viper Room on the Sunset Strip a little while ago.\n\nfiktiv\n\nA GUEST POSTING by STEVE McLEAN\n\nJC writes…..\n\nAs previously mentioned, Steve McLean has been a long time friend of the blog, having contributed a few guest postings over the years, including his take on The Last Temptation of Elvis compilation album, ICAs on Chuck Mosley and Natalie Merchant/10,000 Maniacs, appreciation of the Marc & Lard radio show, and a tribute to musical theatre.\n\nA reminder that he makes a living (in part) from stand-up comedy, and, with the month of August coming around, he and many others will be making his way to Edinburgh in search of an audience. I’ve been to a couple of Steve’s previous shows and been thoroughly entertained, and, as becoming tradition, I’m giving the blog over to him for a day so that he can plus his new show…… so without further ado, I’ll pass the mic to him.\n\n——-\n\nHello Internet-ians (that’s people of the internet, not people of the internet only called Ian). It’s that time of the year when I suddenly remember I like writing about music, you know when the Edinburgh fringe is coming up, and I have a show to plug? Seriously though, that whole Fringe thing is just a framing device, so I can spam you with my thoughts on songs I like.\n\nThis year I am doing a fucking great show (or it will be great when it’s written, at the moment it’s just a really good idea and even then the word ‘good’ is subjective). I’m presenting the A to Z of 80’s hair rock (not the crap loser stuff like Jane’s Addiction or The Cult but the uber-cool stuff like Warrant and Faster Pussycat).\n\nI grew up in a small, insular place, I was spotty, not very well liked and I absolutely repelled women. BUT! Then I discovered the majestic genius that was Joe Perry and all of that changed. I wore make up, a bandana and ripped jeans. I didn’t repel women anymore! I repelled everyone.\n\nWhile the dorks were sat on their beds in the dark listening to The Smiths or The Wedding Present, I was rocking out with my headphones on, pretending to be C.C. Deville of Poison. Fucking cool, right?\n\nI’ve often thought that indie music and hair metal have more in common than people realise. Both genres seem to me to be mainly songs about unattainable women sang by people with bad hair that you’d cross the street to avoid. Don’t believe me? Go get your guitar and change the badly played chuggy riffs to badly played feeble strums. QED.\n\nSo in the name of building bridges and uniting music communities that probably don’t exist anymore, I present to you an Indie-ish guide to hair metal and pomp rock.\n\n(CONTRACTUAL SMALL PRINT I’m being pretty broadwith my definition of the term Indie. Don’t send me messages saying ‘actuallllly they were on a major label’ or “Aztec Camera were a pop band, not an indie band’ because I’ll just print them out, hang them in the toilet next to the Cease and Desist order I’ve got from Morrissey and laugh when I’m having a dump).\n\nmp3: Luna – Sweet Child Of Mine (Guns’n’Fuck’n’Roses)\n\nIan Watson of the seminal indie club How Does It Feel To Be Loved introduced me to this. It’s corking, right? I don’t know much about Luna but everything about this song tells me they spent a lot of time at school being relieved of their dinner money during the morning break.\n\nGuns’n’Fuck’n’Roses were once proclaimed to be the most dangerous band in the world, which is weird because their backstage rider contained fresh cottage cheese, organic honey and the catering tables had to be dressed with linen table cloths, NOT PAPER! Nothing says danger like soft cheese and soft cotton. Just like Satan himself would demand.\n\nmp3: Manic Street Preachers – Under My Wheels (Alice Cooper)\n\nEarly Manics got lumped in with a lot of late 80’s hair metal. They got a lot of press in RAW and Kerrang! magazines. It was the eyeliner and the Johnny Thunders‘ look. They pissed on those chips pretty soon though, going down an NME road that ultimately led to Britpop. Fucking losers.\n\nThis is a great Alice Cooper song. Two facts about Alice Cooper that might surprise you – He’s a Republican voter. Imagine the guy who sang a song called Cold Ethyl which is about fucking a dead body, then voting for the so called family values of the GOP. Although the more we find out about Rudy Giullani, that’s probably always been on brand. In the name of political balance I should point out that Jill Biden also has sex with a lifeless body.\n\nSecond Alice Cooper Fact (and thanks to swc for the prompt!). He was best friends with Ronnie Corbett.\n\nmp3: Dandy Warhols – Hell’s Bells (ACDC)\n\nThis is an ACDC classic (and much loved by Ally McCoist) that’s been given the slacker once-over. The Dandy’s were the kings of art rock cool for about 20 minutes in the late 90s until The Strokes turned up and stole their thunder. You bastards, how could you do that to them? To be fair, they didn’t help themselves with the Vodafone advert.\n\nThey also covered Ted Nugent‘s Free For All which is a great song lost to history because, well, it’s by Ted Nugent and no one who isn’t regularly molesting farm animals will ever listen to him again. If you’re ever thinking ‘Sure, Ted’s a shitty racist with creepy sex pest overtones but c’mon, he’s a hippy from the 60s and 70s, so his mind is probably strung out on smack, acid and Jack Daniels’ ….Well let me tell, he’s been sober since 1967. So there’s no twisted mind-altering substance that made him who he is, he’s just a cunt.\n\nmp3: Aztec Camera – Jump (Van Halen)\n\nThis is fucking amazing song. You know how I know it’s an amazing song? It’s a hair rock pomp tune being played by melodic pop act and it still sounds cracking. Did you know that it has also been covered by Mary Lou Lord and Paul Anka? The reason why it works so well is that it’s not played for laughs, Roddy Frame entirely commits to and it’s lush as fuck.\n\nVan Halen have had an interesting revolving door of singers. Eddie Van Halen fell out with David Lee Roth so hired Sammy Hagar. He than fell out with Hagar so hired Gary Cherone of Extreme (Cherone was just pleased to be there since he now didn’t have to sing More Than Fucking Words every night) He then re-hired Roth, then re-hired Hagar, then re-hired Roth again and fired the bass player Michael Anthony. Basically what I’m saying is ‘Imagine being in a band with David Lee Roth and David Lee Roth turns out not to be the biggest bell-end’.\n\nmp3: The Breeders – Lord Of The Thighs (Aerosmith)\n\nI couldn’t decide between this and REM‘s cover of Toys in the Attic to represent America’s Greatest Ever Rock Band (TM), I chose this, really because the more that comes out about Steve Tyler‘s frankly fucking awful behavior, the more teenage me wants the songs to be rescued. The uncomfortable-1970s-lyrics-when-listened-through-2024-ears are given a 90s feminist kick in the dick, The song is saved as it becomes a queer sex anthem and everyone forgets about Steven Tyler what he did, and I don’t have to get rid of my Aerosmith records.\n\nThere’s a storming live version here\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9pqiWjC2Yc\n\nThere’s a couple of others that didn’t make the final list including the Lemonheads covering Kiss and another Manics shout (It’s So Easy by Guns’N’Fuck’N’Roses). You know I’m really surprised that the Wedding Present haven’t done a cover of I Don’t Want To Miss a Thing, it feels right up their B-Side / Session street. If you’re reading this, Gedge, buck up.\n\nBelle and Sebastian should have made this list too with something like Legs by ZZ Top. What can I say? I’m an ideas man. Although, a hair metal tribute to C86 seems the next logical step in this.\n\nIf you’re at the Edinburgh Fringe then please come to my show. It’s every day (except Tuesdays) at 2.45pm at the Slow Progress cafe (it’s free, although I’ll ask you for a donation at the end. It’s basically indoor busking.\n\nSTEVE\n\nJC adds….\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Steve’s shows are always good fun, albeit you better be on your guard for audience participation. As he says above, it’s part of the Free Fringe and so there’s no stupidly priced admission (+ booking fee!!), and in typical tradition of the buskers, you can just put some money into a hat at the end of the show.\n\nThe Slow Progress Cafe is on Blackfriars Street, very handily located just off the Royal Mile in the very centre of the city. If you’re in Edinburgh during August, you don’t have any excuses to miss out…\n\nA guest posting by Fraser Pettigrew\n\nFor me, one of the most wonderful things about vinyl records is that they constitute a current technology that in essence hasn’t changed in nearly 150 years. Apart from the migration from a wax cylinder onto a flat disc and advances in electronic amplification, the reproduction of sound by means of a needle transmitting vibrations from the physical rotation of an etched groove is the same technology that Thomas Edison patented in 1877. That’s pretty remarkable when you consider how radical our technological evolution has been in most other respects over the same period.\n\nI had never really thought much about the development of different record formats until relatively recently when I spent a year and a half working at New Zealand’s film, TV and radio archive. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision doesn’t really cover music records in its collection, but I was interested to discover that the origins of the 33 1/3 rpm vinyl LP – as distinct from the 78 rpm disc – actually lie in the development of sound in the movies, and in radio, not in the music industry.\n\nBut first, some early history.\n\nIt was about ten years after Edison’s patent that the lateral disc first emerged, and a few more years until the end of the century before it evolved as a viable commercial sound format. The 78 rpm disc did not become standard until around the start of WW1 – early discs varied in diameter and rotation speed, from 7 to 12 ½ inches and from 60 to 130 rpm. The Gramophone Company settled on 78 rpm in 1912 simply because it was the average speed of most of the records it had been releasing up to then. It wasn’t until the mid-1920s that 78 rpm became the industry standard.\n\nEven then, electrically powered gramophone players would vary according to the rating of the local power supply. So, in a city with a 50hz AC supply your 78rpm disc would play slower than in a city with a 60hz supply. If you were still using a hand-cranked spring driven gramophone you were at the mercy of all sorts of mechanical malfunction.\n\nElectricity didn’t play a part in the recording process until the mid-1920s. Louis Armstrong’s second wife famously recalled a recording session in 1923 where the young Armstrong and band leader King Oliver played side by side into the large horn that acoustically channelled the sound to the lathe cutting the master disc. King Oliver couldn’t be heard at all in the resultant recording, so Satchmo was made to stand about fifteen feet away for the next take.\n\nmp3: King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band – Dippermouth Blues (1923)\n\nWhen electricity began to play a part in both recording and amplifying the contents of discs, it was the film industry that took the technology and initiated a development that was the first step towards the vinyl LP that we know and love.\n\nFilms had long been accompanied by live musicians, sometimes a single pianist or organist, but also whole ensembles. Filmmakers began commissioning arrangers and composers to create suites of music, scored to complement the action on screen, including sound effects. Clever-clogs Charlie Chaplin composed his own musical accompaniments. Where musicians were too difficult or costly to provide at screenings, the obvious alternative was recorded discs, but the 78rpm disc has one significant drawback here – each 10-inch side can hold barely three minutes of music. The sound man would need to do more flipping than a McDonald’s burger chef.\n\nmp3: Charlie Chaplin (composer) – Afternoon (from ‘City Lights, 1931)\n\nSome short films had used synchronised 78rpm discs to provide sound as early as 1902, but it wasn’t until the development of the Vitaphone system in 1926 that the technique matured to provide sound for full-length features. Vitaphone used 16-inch discs that ran at the slower speed of 331/3 rpm, enabling the sound man to relax and enjoy a fag or two between side changes. Vitaphone was used for numerous films up until 1931, by which time the use of optical soundtrack technology had been perfected.\n\nThis proto-talkie history helps to explain how the art of sound mixing and soundtrack direction seemed to emerge almost fully-formed in the earliest years of sound cinema. The way, for example, that Hitchcock was able to use sound in ‘Blackmail’, a film that began production as a silent feature, seems miraculously advanced, but then you can see how filmmakers had been thinking about, if not actually using sound for several years already.\n\nDespite its obvious advantages, it’s strange that the 33 1/3 rpm disc did not immediately find favour in the music industry even as it fell out of favour in the cinema. It continued in use for radio transcription, still often using 16-inch discs, right through until after WW2 when magnetic tape began to displace the large and fragile lacquer discs. Meanwhile the 78 still reigned in the world of music, and was still in use at the beginning of the rock’n’roll era. Early Elvis Presley and Bill Haley 78s will fetch a pretty sum these days.\n\nmp3: Elvis Presley – Heartbreak Hotel (78rpm)\n\nIn part, the slow advent of the vinyl 33 can be attributed to the simple barrier of having to replace one universal standard format with another. The 78 rpm gramophone players to be found in consumers’ homes couldn’t play any other sort of record. It’s akin to the change from vinyl to CD that occurred in the late 1980s and 1990s. To play the new format disc you needed to buy an entirely new hi-fi component.\n\nThis explains why most of the first CD releases were classical rather than pop. Classical enthusiasts tended to belong to a wealthier stratum of society who were in a position to invest in the new technology. A large chunk of my own classical vinyl collection was picked up for buttons in the late 1980s at Edinburgh’s Record Shak boutique on Clerk Street, where some well-heeled collector had deposited all his unwanted records after replacing the whole lot at a stroke with new CDs!\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 40s the development of the 33 crept forwards in relative obscurity. As mentioned, radio continued to make recordings for broadcast (or from broadcasts) onto the long-playing format, on 10, 12, 14 or 16-inch discs. These were mostly on incredibly fragile ‘acetate’ discs – aluminium platters covered in a lacquer onto which the sound lathe could cut directly, prone to cracking with age or if temperature changes caused the metal base to expand and contract.\n\nTypically these discs were one-off recordings and did not need to be reproduced, but increasingly they would be pressed in multiple copies so that they could be sent to numerous radio stations simultaneously. Advertisers for radio exploited this possibility too. Polyvinyl chloride (‘vinyl’) as a medium for reproducing these discs was developed and proliferated during the late 1930s and 40s owing to its ability to be transported and even posted without risking breakage like acetates or heavy, brittle shellac.\n\nRCA Victor had attempted to launch vinyl 33s as early as 1931. Their timing was off, however. The Great Depression ensured that there were not enough buyers prepared to invest in new equipment for many years. It wasn’t until after the war that the record companies came back to the idea for another try. This time the conditions were right as the legacy of the New Deal and post-war recovery put money in ordinary people’s pockets.\n\nInterestingly, Columbia’s first 12-inch 33 1/3 RPM ‘long-players’ released in 1948 were classical, perhaps prefiguring the same economic dynamic of the CD era. The following year, RCA Victor re-entered the vinyl market with the first 45 RPM 7-inch discs, in seven different colours of vinyl according to music genre! Green (country), yellow (children’s), red (classical), orange (R&B and gospel), blue vinyl/blue label (semi-classical instrumental) and blue vinyl/black label (international).\n\nmp3: Eddy Arnold – Texakarna Baby (RCA Victor Green Vinyl & Label, 1949)\n\nAt first the 33 and the 45 were seen by the two companies as competing formats, but within two years each had also adopted the other’s innovation, and the familiar ‘single’ and ‘LP’ distinction quickly formed across the whole industry.\n\nThat then, in a very large nutshell, is the story of the vinyl record. Before I finish, here’s a couple of further random bits of record info:\n\nIt might be thought that the music album is a commodity born from the emergence of the 33 1/3 long-player in the 1950s. However, the first so-called ‘albums’ of music date back to the first decade of the 20th century. While a single 78 only held three or four minutes of sound per side, longer pieces of music (such as classical compositions) were recorded onto several discs and then packaged together into a book-like format, where the pages were the individual record sleeves. Because of their resemblance to large format photographic albums, already common to many families, the name was borrowed for the collection of discs. The first such music albums were classical collections (funnily enough) produced in 1908 and 1909. You could soon buy empty albums in which to store your own collection of 78s, rather like those portable CD cases you can possibly still get. When the 33 1/3 LP format became established with the ability to hold a dozen or more songs on one disc it became the natural inheritor of the ‘album’ label.\n\nFinally, there is another iconic technology invented at almost the same time as Edison’s phonograph that has similarly survived almost unchanged into the current era – the bicycle. Aside from the advancement in materials and adaptations for different terrain, the bike that Bradley Wiggins toured France on or Danny MacAskill rides down mountains is in its fundamentals identical to the ‘safety bicycle’ of the late 1870s that quickly consigned the penny farthing to history.\n\nAll of which must make my vinyl copy of Kraftwerk’s Tour de France Soundtracks the ultimate retro-modernist artefact, most especially when it’s played on this: https://peewee.com/2015/10/16/tgif-a-bicycle-that-plays-vinyl-records-on-its-wheels/\n\nmp3: Kraftwerk – Tour de France\n\nFraser\n\nYesterday’s news of the death of Steve Albini has led to a change of plan on the blog. This was meant to be the slot for Dirk‘s latest guest offering, but that has been put back till early next week.\n\nIn terms of Albini’s career as a musician, I can’t really offer all that much up. I have a handful of Big Black tracks, all downloaded from other blogs over the years, but across almost 50,000 tracks on the hard drive of the laptop, there’s nothing by Rapeman or Shellac. The very name of the former is off-putting enough to have them permanently on ignore, while the couple of times I have listened to the latter didn’t lead to any detailed exploration.\n\nI have a fair number of albums in which Albini’s engineering/production skills were utilised, and it’s from those that I’ve very quickly pulled together an ICA as a way of paying tribute. Most of what was written in the hours after the news broke went heavy on the well known and successful bands he worked alongside, but what I think really stands out is his involvement with loads of acts who were more ‘under the radar’, and how he seemed to have an uncanny ability to bring out the very best in all the musicians he worked with (albeit this ICA leans very heavily on the better-known names).\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. Bone Machine – Pixies (from Surfer Rosa, 1988)\n\nThe opening track of the debut album by Pixies seems as good a place to start as any. A record that has sold around 1 million copies worldwide since its release, but like anything Albini ever worked on, he received no royalties, thanks to his lifelong practice of charging a flat fee for his involvement. I believe his stance on this was that looking to take any future royalties would be insulting to the band.\n\n2. Have A Go – Spare Snare (from The Brutal, 2023)\n\nAlbini came to Edinburgh in late 2022 and worked with Spare Snare in a studio owned and managed by Rod Jones of Idlewild. It was a big thing for Spare Snare as the record marked their 30th Anniversary and the end product turned out to be one of their best and best-received albums. Both parties enjoyed the experience so much that the possibility of having Spare Snare, later this year or early next, head to Albini’s studio in Chicago for further sessions, was being explored. Sadly, it wasn’t to be.\n\n3. Fuck Treasure Island – Scout Niblett (from Kidnapped By Neptune, 2005)\n\nScout Niblett is an English-born singer-songwriter who has lived and worked in the USA since 2003, basing herself in Portland, Oregon. I became aware of her in 2007 when I caught her live at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto, the first gig I went to during my six-month work placement in the city that summer. She was the support act, and I’d never heard of her. In fact, all I knew of the main act, an up-and-coming female singer who went by the name of St Vincent, was that she had previously been in The Polyphonic Spree. I went home that night with three CDs – the debut St Vincent album and two Albini-produced CDs from earlier in the career of Scout Niblett.\n\n4. Heather – The Wedding Present (from Seamonsters, 1991)\n\nI’ve self-imposed a rule of just one song from any band. Otherwise, The Wedding Present would have been all over this ICA. Albini worked extensively over the years with the band, but is probably most loved by fans for Seamonsters, a truly outstanding record in so many ways.\n\n5. Wait In The Car – The Breeders (single, 2017)\n\nThe Breeders enjoyed most success with Last Splash in 1993, which just happens to be the only album of the five they have released not to have involved Steve Albini….go figure!!! Wait In The Car was released as a single in October 2017, the band’s first new piece of music in eight years. It really was a superb return to form, leaning heavily on the music that had won then so many fans back in the 90s, and it laid the table perfectly for the later release of the album All Nerve in March 2018.\n\nSIDE B\n\n1. Homewrecker! – Jarvis Cocker (from Further Complications, 2009)\n\nFurther Complications was a radical departure from Jarvis‘s eponymous debut album from three years earlier, and it caught out a few people, including myself. It’s one of those albums that I only fell for many years later, when I gave it a second chance while lying on a beach on holiday. Maybe it needed the warm Caribbean sunshine rather than the Scottish wind and rain to make some sense. There’s loads happening on Homewrecker!, with the vocals not kicking in until well over a minute into the song. Dig those horns!!!\n\n2. Buddha – The Auteurs (from After Murder Park, 1996)\n\nLuke Haines was astonished when his record label agreed to his suggestion of having Albini engineer/produce the band’s third (and what proved to be last) studio album. It was all done and dusted in the space of two weeks in March 1995 – Albini never wanted to spend anything more than that amount of time on any one record. It didn’t see the light of day for almost a year, as it was as far removed as could be imagined from the Britpop sound that was all the rage at the time. The album has been described, with great affection, by one critic as a ‘monsterpiece’.\n\n3. Rid Of Me – PJ Harvey (from Rid Of Me, 1993)\n\nAll that Luke Haines’ bosses had to do was listen and compare PJ Harvey‘s first two studio albums. It would soon dawn on them that polished pop wasn’t Albini’s calling card, and that more often than not, the end product could best be described as raw and aggressive. Rid Of Me has a huge amount of angry lyrics, a number of which Polly Jean has since admitted were autobiographical, and the genius of Albini is that his work makes the music sound every bit as psychotic and unhinged as the words.\n\n4. Let’s Pretend – Cinerama (from Disco Volante,2000)\n\nForgive me if I don’t say too much at this juncture as Strangeways will, over the next couple of months, go into a lot of detail about Cinerama within his guest postings on Sundays; I’ve avoided including any of the band’s singles from this era on the ICA, and instead gone with an album track that is one of David Gedge’s very best break-up songs. It also demonstrates that Albini was no one-trick pony in the studio.\n\n5. All Apologies – Nirvana (1993)\n\nEven more quickly than I had envisaged Bone Machine as being the perfect ICA opener, I had decided that this was going to end the ICA. In typical Albini fashion, the recording of Nirvana‘s third studio album was completed in just two weeks in February 1993. The record label bosses weren’t all that happy with the end product, and this led to Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M., to be brought on board to remix the songs that were best reckoned as being suitable singles. All Apologies was one of those. It took until 2013, and a 20th anniversary reissue of the album which included bonus discs, for the original version to finally be given an official release.\n\nIf I had taken a bit more time, I might have come up with a different track listing. This one has a lot of gut instinct. But I really wanted the ICA to be timely, and I hope it’s one that you’ll appreciate and perhaps enjoy.\n\nJC\n\nA guest posting by Fraser Pettigrew\n\nBy the beginning of the 1990s I had all but lost touch with contemporary rock and pop. As the bold experiments of the early 1980s faded into history to be replaced by pop-pastiche glazed with varying degrees of post-modern irony, my interest levels faded too. Several of my former favourites were still making music, but the likes of New Order, the Banshees and Cabaret Voltaire failed to hold my attention as their focus changed, and others like Paul Weller’s Style Council and A Certain Ratio simply vanished from view.\n\nThe late 1980s had ushered in acid house and techno, the baggy-Madchester scene and shoegaze, but none of these new styles captured my imagination. Most of the house and techno that reached my ears was the lowest common denominator stuff in the charts, the Madchester shufflebeat sounded like retro late-60s revivalism to me, and if shoegaze ever crossed my path I must have mistaken it for some radio static rather than music.\n\nI barely listened to John Peel any more as the BBC perpetually shifted and reduced his schedules, and I had long ago given up on reading the NME for fear of disappearing up the same smug, self-congratulatory arsehole. My sources of information were therefore much reduced and as my judgements above clearly indicate, I wasn’t really looking too hard for vital signs at the same time as pronouncing the patient deceased.\n\nInstead, I had turned my ears in a more folksy and world music direction. My record collection swelled with the addition of albums by Hungarian troupe Musikas, the Hannibal label Balkana compilation, and Serbo-Croat music by Vujicsics. I went to the Junction in Cambridge to see Cajun legends D.L. Menard and Eddie LeJeune, and the unforgettable Ivo Papasov and his Bulgarian Wedding Band. Legendary, unforgettable and sometimes pronounceable.\n\nmp3: Ivo Papasov and His Bulgarian Wedding Band – Mamo Marie Mamo\n\nFun as this was for a while, I knew there was something missing, but I just didn’t know where to look. I dabbled in grunge but most of it felt too close to metal for my liking. A few friends introduced me to a couple of acts that held promise of life after death of the new wave. The New Fast Automatic Daffodils briefly built a bridge between Madchester and a paisley-free universe, despite their terminally stupid name. Fatima Mansions came to town and ripped Cambridge a new one in a most satisfactory fashion, adding Viva Dead Ponies, plus mini-albums Against Nature and Bertie’s Brochures to my record shelves.\n\nmp3: New Fast Automatic Daffodils – Big\n\nmp3: Fatima Mansions – Mr. Baby\n\nIt was in 1992 that I chanced upon a couple of recommendations that really restored my faith that there was contemporary music out there worth listening to and set me on paths of discovery that required greatly increased record storage by the time the decade was out. The first came from a review in The Guardian that opened with a line something like “the list of Great British Techno Albums is a short one.” I wanted to find some great techno. I knew there had to be some that fulfilled the promise of Giorgio Moroder, Kraftwerk, DAF and early New Order, I Feel Love, Number One in Heaven, Everything’s Gone Green, Der Mussolini… Everyone said these were the ancestors of techno, where were the descendants?\n\nThe album was BFORD9 by Baby Ford. I’d never heard of Peter ‘Baby’ Ford even though this was his third LP. I swiftly located it in Cambridge’s Parrot Records. It looked lovely, the whole sleeve depicted a thick, formless impasto of shiny black acrylic paint, with the title and credits in big, bold modern type. I got it home and slapped it on my turntable.\n\nOh Christ. I’ve made a terrible mistake, I thought. Luckily there was no one else in the house as my stereo cranked out the first two tracks of nosebleeding hardcore ravey-davey gash. No wonder everyone’s on drugs when they listen to this shite… Track three however shifted into a quite different register, thank god. Move-On had a more laid-back soul groove with a sweet rising chord progression. The rest of this might be listenable after all.\n\nmp3: Baby Ford – Move- On\n\nAnd so it proved, in spades. Even though the album demonstrates the common house/techno trait of offering multiple versions of the same tracks on the same disc, the variations are sufficiently diverse and craftily arranged to make it feel more like a suite than a remix compilation. To be fair, most of it is hardly what you’d call techno at all. The more hardcore tracks are an immeasurable improvement on the two openers (one of them a remix of aforesaid gash), but the downbeat, loungey instrumental ‘20 Park Drive’ sounds like one of Isaac Hayes’s extended grooves. The glorious ‘Sashay Round the Fuzzbox’ is a techno-funk classic that would make you believe Booker T and the MGs had been reincarnated and a few eckies slipped into their bourbon.\n\nmp3: Baby Ford – 20 Park Drive\n\nmp3: Baby Ford – Sashay Around The Fuzzbox\n\nSadly, BFORD9 did not prove to be a springboard for further Baby Ford releases, which have been sporadic ever since. Nevertheless, this slice of (mostly) genius gave me the confidence to embrace other dance music artists in the coming years, albeit the more mainstream ones, but without BFORD9 I probably wouldn’t have gone looking for the likes of Orbital, Fluke, Underworld, Future Sound of London, Leftfield, The Shamen and Finitribe. Thankfully I did.\n\nThe second album that turned things around for me in 1992 was found through Q magazine. First The Guardian, now Q, ageing young rebel or what? I’d started dipping into Q in a conscious search for some direction and had already bought a couple of things on the strength of their album reviews, but neither Rev by Ultra Vivid Scene, nor the debut CD by a short-lived band called Miss World really set my heather on fire.\n\nThen I read a review of an LP called Peng! by a band called Stereolab. Sounded interesting, so I dug it out on my next visit to Parrot Records.\n\nEye-boggling orange on yellow sleeve design. Ouch. Just possible to read lyric excerpts hinting at radical politics and philosophy. So far so good… Onto the deck, and …play. Ohhhhh yesssssss. From the first drone of dreamy fuzz guitar and keyboard overlaid with an alluring female French pop vocal I was a fan. Tracks, with arresting titles like ‘Orgiastic’, ‘Perversion’ and ‘You Little Shits’, alternated between mellow, downbeat numbers and faster guitar-heavy, squealing organ thrashes that immediately evoked the Velvet Underground of 1969: Live, the frantic pickup-scrubbing versions of ‘What Goes On’ and ‘Rock and Roll’.\n\nmp3: Stereolab – Orgiastic\n\nmp3: Stereolab – Perversion\n\nmp3: Stereolab – You Little Shits\n\nThe Velvet Underground was the reference point in the Q review that piqued my interest and it’s interesting that neither Q nor my own first impressions called to mind the krautrock influences of Neu! and Faust that came to define Stereolab later. No one mentions the Velvets when talking about Stereolab now, but the force was strong on Peng! It might be argued that the retro vibes I derided in the Madchester sound and the droning fuzz of shoegaze were both prominent here so what the fuck was my problem? I would argue back that, apart from my earlier judgement being defective, those elements are absorbed and remoulded and not slavishly imitated. Stereolab reminded you of something, but they didn’t exactly sound like anyone else. Like all the best bands, I would say that Stereolab tip their hat to their influences but don’t play dress-up all the way down to their pointy shoes.\n\nThankfully I caught Stereolab right at the beginning and was able to follow them faithfully through the rest of the 1990s, and their devotion to vinyl further cemented them in my affection. And while they are notable for not being part of any ‘scene’ or sub-genre or media-concocted movement, the successful fact of having matched up my interpretation of a magazine review with something I really liked opened a door for me to trust my intuition and take a punt on what else was going on around me.\n\nThey don’t fall into the same category-of-one as Stereolab, but acts like Suede, PJ Harvey, Seefeel, Spiritualized, Boo Radleys and bands of the later 90s flushed out by the ‘Britpop’ scene such as Mansun, Super Furry Animals and The Bluetones might have passed me by if Peng! hadn’t woken me up.\n\nFor me, BFORD9 and Peng! were a kind of ‘sliding doors’ moment. What might have been? Might I have continued ploughing the folky furrow, finding myself years thence, at another identical Christy Moore performance? I’ve seen him twice, which was at least once too many. Or yet another Fairport Convention reunion? No, I’ve been stuck in a park at the Cambridge Folk Festival with no way of escaping them once, and if that had been my fate I’m sure I would have come to my senses and rushed out to purge myself in the entire back-catalogue of Atari Teenage Riot. I have The Guardian and Q magazine and Stereolab and Baby Ford to thank for making such a drastic remedy unnecessary. And you know, to remind you what Louis Armstrong said, it’s all folk, cause horses don’t sing.\n\nFraser\n\nOnce again, this is the part of the series where I consult one of my reference books and find some new 45s which didn’t sell in enough numbers in March 1979 to bother the chart compilers.\n\nI’m starting things off with The Distractions. The Great Indie Discography, written back in 1999 and updated in 2003 by Martin C. Strong (from now on in referred to as ‘The Big Red Indie-Bible’) tells us this:-\n\n“Consisting of founder-members Mike Finney (vocals) and Steve Perrin- Brown (guitar), together with Adrian Wright (guitar), Pip Nicholls (bass) and Alec Sidebottom (drums), this Manchester-based outfit had a hectic touring schedule supporting the likes of Magazine, Buzzcocks and just about every Mancunian New Wave act around at the time.”\n\nThey signed to TJM Records, a label that had been launched by Tony Davidson, the owner of TJ Davidson Rehearsal Studios in Little Peter Street, Manchester, the location from whom which many a band launched a career, particularly Joy Division.\n\nThe debut release was the You’re Not Going Out Dressed Like That EP, from which this was the lead track:-\n\nmp3: The Distractions – It Doesn’t Bother Me\n\nThe group would release another single before the year was out, this time on Factory Records. I’ll highlight that later in the year.\n\nStaying with the letter ‘D’\n\nmp3 : Doll by Doll – The Palace Of Love\n\nDoll by Doll was formed by Kirkcaldy-born Jackie Leven, who, having started out as a folk musician, was another to be smitten by the advent of punk/new wave. The band, which also had Jo Shaw, Robin Spreafico and David McIntosh as members, signed to Automatic Records, an off-shoot of Warners. Whoever pulled together the wiki page got this right:-\n\n“They came to prominence during the new wave period but were largely ignored by the music press of the time – their emotional, psychedelic-tinged music was judged out of step with other bands of the time”.\n\nThere were a few performers/bands who despised the new wave scene, particularly in New York. This led to what was termed ‘No Wave’, and I’ll again turn to wiki:-\n\nNo wave was an avant-garde music genre and visual art scene which emerged in the late 1970s in Downtown New York City. The term was a pun based on the rejection of commercial new wave music. Reacting against punk rock’s recycling of rock and roll clichés, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance, and atonality, as well as non-rock genres like free jazz, funk, and disco. The scene often reflected an abrasive, confrontational, and nihilistic world view.\n\nOne of the leading proponents of the no wave scene was Lydia Lunch. Her band, Teenage Jesus & The Jerks, released a single in March 1979:-\n\nmp3: Teenage Jesus & The Jerks – Baby Doll\n\nI’ve a feeling most of you will be pleased it’s all over and done with in just over 90 seconds.\n\nAnd now for something completely different:-\n\nmp3: Tubeway Army – Down In The Park\n\nThey had started out as a guitar-based new wave band, Mean Street, but the dawn of 1978 saw a change of name to Tubeway Army, albeit the new wave element was still to the fore (they supported The Skids at gigs in the summer of ’78). By the end of the year, a debut album had been released, with the lead singer changing his name from Gary Webb to Gary Numan, and looking to incorporate synths into the group. The album sold modestly, but there was enough interest at Beggars Banquet to fund a follow-up for planned release in mid-1979, and Down In The Park was seen as being the advance single. It didn’t sell very well, but things were about to change….as will be seen later in the series.\n\nmp3: The Pop Group – She Is Beyond Good and Evil\n\nI’m not someone who has ever been fully enamoured by The Pop Group, which is why they haven’t previously featured on the blog, but there’s no denying that they are so often cited as being a huge influence on the way music would shape and form in subsequent decades. The debut single was released in March 1979.\n\nIt was also the month in which the final 45 from the original line-up of this lot was released before the frontman went solo:-\n\nmp3: Jonathan Richman & The Modern Lovers – Lydia\n\nHaving started off things off in Manchester, I think it’s appropriate to finish with the lead track from another EP released on the TJM label in March 79.\n\nmp3: Slaughter and The Dogs – It’s Alright\n\nHmmmm…….on this evidence, it’s easy to see why this lot never really got much attention beyond that provided by a local fan base.\n\nJC\n\nHere comes an ICA from a short-lived band, with just two albums and seven UK singles to select from. Despite this, it was still a bit of an ask to narrow it down to just ten songs.\n\nFirst thing to sort out….the name of the band. The first album and early singles were credited to The Colour Field. Come 1987, with the release of the lead single from what proved to be the second and final album, they were known as The Colourfield. Later compilation albums, whether encompassing Terry Hall‘s wider career or being solely focussed on this particular band, refer to The Colourfield. As I’m now going to do from now on.\n\nThe demise of Fun Boy Three led to Terry Hall pulling together The Colourfield in 1984. The other two members were Toby Lyons on keyboards/guitar and Karl Shale on bass. Toby had been part of The Swinging Cats*, a ska-influenced group from Coventry who had released one single on 2 Tone Records back in 1980, while Karl, also from Coventry, had played with a couple of new wave influenced bands who never quite made it.\n\nChrysalis Records, having been happy enough with the commercial success of Fun Boy Three, put a deal on the table, and as such, every Colourfield release in the UK would be via the label.\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. The Colour Field (single, January 1984)\n\nIt makes sense to start proceedings with the debut single, released in January 1984. Terry Hall promised that his new band would be taking a totally different direction to what had come before. Some of those who had championed him since he had burst onto the scene weren’t impressed. One journalist in a UK music paper, on reviewing the debut single, went as far as this:-\n\n‘This lot have absolutely nothing going for them. No sense of humour. No glamour. No good melodies. No danceable rhythms. No excitement. No controversy. No emotion. Nothing whatsoever. They are, in short, ruddy awful’\n\nUtter bullshit. The problem was that such reviews and other less than fulsome praise, combined with the single not getting onto the A-list at Radio 1, meant it wasn’t all that widely heard and so ended up missing out on being a big hit, stalling at #43.\n\n2. My Wild Flame (b-side, January 1985)\n\nIn terms of the chronology of the band, there would be an even bigger flop as the second single Take, released in July 1984, barely scraped into the Top 75. The record company executives may well have been examining the fine print of the contract as 1985 rolled around, with the debut album scheduled for release in the spring/early summer. In some ways, a reset button was pressed, and a big push was made on the third single, released in January 1985. Thinking Of You was a hit, getting to #12. I’ll get round to that later in this ICA….in the meantime, I’m offering up the poptastic and jaunty b-side for your enjoyment. And yes, it is more or less a re-write of the debut single!!!\n\n3. Things Could Be Beautiful (single, January 1986)\n\nThe hit single had helped the debut album, Virgins and Philistines, reach #12. It only hung around the charts for seven weeks, primarily as neither of the next two singles lifted from it made any dents. The group went into the studio towards the end of 1985, with an additional member, Gary Dwyer (ex-Teardrop Explodes), behind the drum kit. A very jaunty and upbeat 45 was recorded and released, assisted in no small measure by the production skills of Ian Broudie. Sadly, it flopped, leading to Terry Hall spending a few months reassessing things. It also led to the record label deciding to have a bigger say on things.\n\n4. Hammond Song (from Virgins and Philistines, May 1985)\n\nA cover version. The original dates from 1979 and was the work of The Roches, a trio of sisters from New York whose folk-like tunes leaned heavily on their sibling harmonies. The Colourfield’s take on things sort of keeps these, although in a way akin to Kirsty MacColl‘s way of doing things, as it sees Terry harmonising with himself. A song in which acoustic guitars strum gently in the background and provides something that all hangs together in a rather lovely way.\n\n5. Thinking Of You (single, January 1985)\n\nThe one big hit for The Colourfield. The third single, and one with a prominent co-vocal from Katrina Phillips. A bitter-sweet love song which, in many ways, provided the template for The Beautiful South. As I said in a previous post back in 2014 looking back at the debut album, I reckon its fair to assume the main reason no-one took the band seriously was that Terry Hall had forged a reputation as a representative of disaffected youth and having been pigeonholed in such a fashion, not too many were keen to allow him to carve a different and more lasting niche. Thinking Of You might have been more a Radio 2 than Radio 1 sort of song, but it was still well worth a listen.\n\nSIDE B\n\n1. Miss Texas 1967 (from Deception, April 1987)\n\nThe second album was recorded in New York, with an American veteran producer, Richard Gottehrer, behind the desk. The band was now reduced to just Terry Hall and Toby Shale, backed by session musicians. The overall result is a bit of a mess, with the sound being very different from the first album and the Ian Broudie single.\n\nDespite the mostly awful production, there are a few worthwhile moments on Deception, not least this lovely number which has a really intriguing title. Intriguing? Well, the actual winner of Miss Texas 1967 was 20-year-old Molly Grubb from Fort Worth, but the TV soap-opera Dallas would reference the contest as part of its scripts, with the winner being Sue Ellen Shepherd, a beauty queen who later married J.R. Ewing, the main heir to the family’s oil business (and an all-round bad guy!!).\n\n2. Monkey In Winter (b-side, May 1987)\n\nThe original version of this can be found on Deception, an album which sold very poorly, spending just one week in the Top 100, reaching #95 in April 1987. The following month, a single from the album was released. She had been written in the mid-60s by Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, one of many songs the duo had composed for The Monkees. The Colourfield version failed even more dismally than the album, but tucked away on the b-side is a remake of Monkey In Winter, with the remix duties being taken care of by Gil Norton, whose work led to a much more sympathetic rendition of the tune. But the key to everything was Terry deciding that the lead vocal would be better delivered by someone else, and he came up with the idea of having Sinead O’Connor come into the studio. It might not sound like anything else The Colourfield ever made, but it’s very much attributed to them.\n\n3. Armchair Theatre (from Virgins and Philistines, May 1985)\n\nRemember how the critics had laid into Terry Hall for failing to be controversial? He kind of thumbs his nose at them with this one.\n\nI’m sitting on the fence again\n\nDrawing straws and pulling strings\n\nDemonstrations pass me by\n\nThis must be the age of something\n\nAnd this was after he had written and recorded the next song on the ICA\n\n4. Cruel Circus (from Virgins and Philistines, May 1985)\n\nKhayem included this on his career-encompassing Terry Hall ICA (#277, February 2021), and in his words, “a biting commentary on animal cruelty, Terry’s lyrics and vocal delivery have lost none of their power and relevance in the subsequent three decades.” 1985 was the year of Meat Is Murder, and I often think that Terry’s contribution to the debate, which focussed on laboratory experiments and fox-hunting, sort of got lost a bit when it should have been the subject of many an article across the broadsheet media.\n\n5. Sorry (b-side, January 1984)\n\nAnd so we find ourselves going full circle, with the b-side to the debut single, and a track which was also used, more than 15 months later, to end the debut album. If, like me, you’re a bit of a sucker for the bitterly honest and straight-from-the-heart break-up songs (the sorts that Elvis Costello and David Gedge have often specialised in over the years) then I hope you’ll agree that this is up there with the best of them.\n\nBONUS EP\n\nTold you earlier that I couldn’t keep it down to 10 tracks. So, here’s the limited edition 4-track EP, available only with the initial copies of this ICA.\n\n(a) mp3: The Colourfield – Castles In The Air\n\n(b) mp3: The Colourfield – The Windmills Of Your Mind\n\n(c) mp3: The Colourfield – Goodbye Sun Valley\n\n(d) mp3: The Colourfield – Your Love Was Smashing\n\n(a) Another flop single, the follow-up to Thinking Of You. Should’ve been a hit but stalled at #51.\n\n(b) A b-side, to the second single, Take. A cover of the song best known as the theme tune to the 1968 film, The Thomas Crown Affair.\n\n(c) The closing track on Deception. The session musicians earn their corn on this one with almost enough different instruments for its own ICA a la JTFL.\n\n(d) Yet another b-side, this one being found on Castles In The Air. I do think Terry Hall took a great amount of perverse pleasure in having some of his best songs of this era being quite obscure in terms of where they were released.\n\nJC\n\n* I’ve had this piece prepared for some time, just waiting on a gap in the schedule to slot it in. Over the weekend, I received a guest posting which, by sheer coincidence, makes reference to The Swinging Cats. Please tune in tomorrow when all will be revealed.\n\nA guest posting by Fraser Pettigrew\n\nMany are the pieces of vinyl that have passed through our hands that were bought, listened to, and then disposed of. Either they were traded in to generate funds for new purchases, or loaned, never to be seen again. Some we don’t miss, for others we harbour slight regrets, and some we mourn deeply, regretting to the depths of our souls the idiocy that caused us to ever contemplate parting with them. This is my confessional list, the ones that got away…\n\nOk, let’s start with the pieces over which we have no regrets, where we quickly recognised that a mistake had been made or where time eroded whatever mild entertainment the disc might once have provided. No regrets, however a sad experience follows that some of you may empathise with.\n\nThe follow-up to Generation X’s peerless first LP was eagerly anticipated by my school friend and I at the beginning of 1979. Thus, clutching four quid each in our sweaty fists, we sprinted out of school at 3.30pm on release day, Friday 26 January, and bussed into town straight to the Virgin shop on Frederick Street in Edinburgh, whence we emerged shortly afterwards each with our own brand-new copy of Valley Of The Dolls.\n\nMonday morning at 9am, we re-encountered each other outside the school and exchanged a look that wordlessly conveyed what dozens of music journalists would fill many column inches expressing: Valley Of The Dolls was shite and our £3.99 had been utterly wasted. My copy went to Greyfriars Market 2nd hand trade-in long before the year was out.\n\nEven The Lurkers’ first two albums lasted longer in my esteem than Valley Of The Dolls, but eventually the guilty pleasure I derived from the Status Quo of punk rock wore down and they had to go. Similarly, the first Simple Minds album Life In A Day was recycled even though I still maintain an equally guilty pleasure in the rest of their early output up to New Gold Dream.\n\nWhich makes it rather baffling that I got rid of my copy of Real to Real Cacophony at some point, as well as Empires and Dance. The latter is more understandable as my first copy was pressed on defective vinyl with a sort of crusty pustule in the middle of This Fear of Gods that only burst after a couple of months playing, by which time the receipt was long gone. Thankfully, I have been able to re-buy decent vinyl copies of both, though probably for five times the original price.\n\nThe sacrifice of items from one’s collection was a necessary evil in days when budget was low, and it would be interesting to remember what it was that I bought with the proceeds of falling out of love with those early Simple Minds albums, or the likes of XTC’s Go2 (complete with bonus 12” dub remix EP Go+), or Glaxo Babies’ Nine Months to the Disco, or Vibing Up The Senile Man, the second album by Alternative TV.\n\nAll of those records I wish I still had, even though I know I wouldn’t be playing them much. By 1979 my taste for the avant-garde was sufficiently advanced to make me want to buy them in the first place, but it must be admitted that the ATV and Glaxo Babies releases were interesting but hardly classic. Another in this line was Andy Partridge’s solo extension of the Go+ concept, Take Away/The Lure of Salvage, a collection of XTC tracks unrecognisably deconstructed in the editing suite. I recently came across a copy of it here in New Zealand, many years after I’d sold my original, and while it’s nice to have it back I am reminded why I let it go in the first place.\n\nMy tolerance for music at the outer limits only goes so far. I once snapped up a double album by American saxophonist Marion Brown on the strength of his luminous and lyrical contribution to Harold Budd’s Pavilion of Dreams, one of Brian Eno’s early Obscure Records releases. Imagine my disappointment when my bargain £2 purchase delivered four sides of unlistenable free jazz torment. My stylus passed through the grooves once only, if that, and then it was gone again.\n\nAs the years go by, it’s impossible for me to deny that I now find much of The Stranglers’ output to be embarrassingly stupid and vulgar. How much of this is justified and how much is a failure to appreciate subtle irony I can’t say, but I think I’ve got a pretty good nose for irony, so I call stooopid. Consequently I’m only a little annoyed that I parted with No More Heroes and Black and White, despite some really top moments on both.\n\nI used to really like The Stranglers. They were one of my ‘big three’ new wave bands along with The Jam and The Clash who were flying the punk flag in the saccharine mire of the charts in 1977 (the Pistols were in a class of their own). I liked them so much that when Black and White came out in May 1978 just when I was out of the country on a school exchange trip, I made my older brother (who loathed punk) go and buy it for me to make sure I got the free white vinyl 7” with it.\n\nTheir cover of Walk On By on that single is a decent, respectable version of a great song, but the flip side, a song called ‘Tits’, sums up the other face of the band. Lad humour only lasts as long as you’re a lad, and eventually you have to grow up. I think I sold No More Heroes, but Black and White, funnily enough, may still reside in my brother’s attic. He can keep it. The single I sold separately.\n\nThe one Stranglers item I DO regret losing is an American release pink vinyl EP, containing four of their very best tracks: Something Better Change, Straighten Out, (Get a) Grip, and Hanging Around. It’s not worth a great deal now, but I doubt I got anything for it when I traded it in.\n\nBut now we get to the bad stuff. A short list of records I have willingly sold, at which I can only hang my head in shame. Deep breath, here goes: Give ‘Em Enough Rope by The Clash, Remain in Light by Talking Heads, Cut by The Slits, Penthouse and Pavement by Heaven 17. Yes, seriously, I possessed first pressings of all of those stone cold classic albums, AND I SOLD THEM! WHAT A FUCKING ARSE!!\n\nThe Clash were one of the first bands I ever saw live, at an epic gig supported by The Slits (described in my very first guest post for JC). It was the promo tour for Give’ Em Enough Rope, which I bought and loved at the time. But some time later I decided it was dispensable for some reason. I blame my friend, the one in the Valley of the Dolls episode above. I was young, naïve, and susceptible to his influence, and somehow I picked up a vibe that The Clash ceased to be indispensable after the first album.\n\nTo be fair, The Clash did generate a fair bit of debate around their dispensability or otherwise. One moment The Most Important Band in the World (© New Musical Express 1978), the next authors of an eclectic rag-bag of Americana despite being once ‘so bored of the USA’. I knew someone who bought and sold Sandinista! no fewer than three times in the confusion. I re-bought Give ‘Em Enough Rope some years later, an identical first pressing to my original, at a decent price.\n\nWith The Slits, I was always a little less enthusiastic about the Dennis Bovell studio incarnation compared to the gloriously ramshackle abrasiveness of the group I saw on stage and heard in the John Peel sessions. I had the Strange Fruit mini-album of those sessions and felt that I could live without the ‘official’ album, so some lucky 2nd hand shop reaped the benefit of my imbecility. When I got the opportunity to re-buy it later, it was in a shitty re-press with I Heard it Through the Grapevine shoehorned onto the end and artwork that was obviously just scanned from a printed copy of the original sleeve. Better than nothing, but I still prefer the Peel sessions.\n\nI don’t know what I was on when I sold Remain In Light. Some mind-altering substance that severely impairs aesthetic judgement, clearly. I mean, everything Talking Heads did AFTER that is certainly dispensable (though I still have it all and never play it!) but Remain In Light is the watershed, the point BEFORE it all drops off, so I really can’t offer a decent excuse. Once again, I struck lucky when I found an almost perfect 2nd hand copy to restore my collection with.\n\nAnd finally, Penthouse and Pavement. What can I say? All of us go through phases in our tastes, we are momentarily consumed with an obsession for Balkan folk music, or zydeco, or free jazz (well, up to a point), and conversely we drift away from certain former favourites. And in that drift lies the danger that we think we’re never going to drift back, so we spring-clean, and then years later we do drift back, especially when we realise it’s not just nostalgia. We have erred. Indeed, we have sinned! And we repent, and seek forgiveness, and must pay penance. Much penance. Much more penance than the pennies we paid for something in the first place. But there it was, a pristine UK pressing of P&P in Slow Boat Records here in Wellington. $35. Probably at least six times its original price. Forgive me father, I won’t do it again, promise.\n\nFraser\n\nJC adds……..\n\nFraser never made any suggestions as to which tunes should accompany his brilliant post. What follows is down to me. But all the songs included are referred to above.\n\nmp3: Various – Fraser’s Ones That Got Away\n\nThere’s a running time of 40:43.\n\nTracklist\n\nGeneration X – King Rocker\n\nAlternative TV – Facing Up To The Facts\n\nXTC – Are You Receiving Me?\n\nGlaxo Babies – Shake (The Foundations)\n\nThe Slits – Love und Romance\n\nSimple Minds – Life In A Day\n\nThe Lurkers – Shadow\n\nThe Stranglers – Something Better Change\n\nMr Partridge – Commerciality\n\nTalking Heads – Crosseyed and Painless\n\nThe Clash – Stay Free\n\nHeaven 17 – Penthouse and Pavement\n\nA guest posting by Leon MacDuff\n\nRecently on these pages, if pages they be, Adrian Mahon offered up a selection of surprising and interesting originals of well-known covers, signing off with “I’m sure you’ll have a few of your own!”. Challenge accepted…\n\nLet’s start with a couple of very well known 80s hits. Yazz and the surely fictional Plastic Population (and her real-life pals in Coldcut) made this one into a huge house-pop success in 1987, but the original goes back to 1980 (and a bit of a throwback even then; from the sound alone, I would have guessed about 1974). I’ve always reckoned that Yazz’s reading feels like false hope, but Clay actually makes it believable.\n\nmp3: Otis Clay: The Only Way Is Up\n\nLike most people, I knew this next one from the 1982 smash by Odyssey. And like most people, I associated its author Lamont Dozier pretty much exclusively with being a songwriter for the sixties Motown production line. But post Motown he went on to issue a string of solo albums, and this future classic arrived on his 1978 offering, Peddlin’ Music On The Side. I do prefer the Odyssey version though:\n\nmp3: Lamont Dozier: Going Back To My Roots\n\nNowadays no Sam and Dave compilation would be complete without this song, but without Elvis Costello it might well have remained just a little-known throwaway B side to a single nobody bought:\n\nmp3: Sam and Dave: I Can’t Stand Up For Falling Down\n\nSome songs come a long way from their originals. You definitely will know this one, but see how long it takes you to recognise it from the original 1948 version, in German…\n\nmp3: Horst Winter und die Swingsingers: Und jetzt ist es still\n\nI always loved Dubstar‘s version of Not So Manic Now. A song with subject matter you don’t hear very often and full of words you would imagine had no business appearing in a pop song. I did notice the writing credit wasn’t for the regular band members, but it was a few years before I got to hear the original by fellow Novocastrians Brick Supply. It was the lead track on their 1994 release Somebody’s Intermezzo EP, which got some decent critical notices but basically went nowhere.\n\nmp3: Brick Supply: Not So Manic Now\n\nAnd finally, a bit of a mystery, and a bit of an investigation. For this one I’m going to share the cover as well, so from 1980 here is the debut single by It’s Immaterial, and from 1967 the original by The First Impression:\n\nmp3: It’s Immaterial: Young Man (Seeks Interesting Job)\n\nmp3: The First Impression: Young Man Seeks An Interesting Job\n\nIt’s Immaterial are cult favourites of course, but weirdly, there’s practically nothing out there about The First Impression. What we do know is that they recorded two LPs for budget label Saga in 1967: the all-covers Beat Club, and the majority of an album called Swinging London which also included a scattering of Beatles covers by Russ Sainty (replaced on the second pressing with a handful of originals by The Good Earth, who subsequently morphed into Mungo Jerry). Young Man is from the Swinging London LP, the sleevenotes of which tell us only that The First Impression are “top discotheque favourites” (Beat Club is similarly unhelpful, offering no description beyond “top London beat group”) – and while some of the songs have appeared on subsequent compilations of 60s mod and psychedelia, the sleevenotes to those seem to just take Saga’s blurbs at their word and have nothing further to add.\n\nPerhaps they were indeed a top London beat group, but even if they were, nothing about their one-and-two-thirds album discography suggests that they were engaged as anything other than a session band. Saga Records weren’t actually a “pop” label – their specialism was cheaply-recorded classical albums, plus bought-in jazz and folk LPs. And really, everything about “Beat Club” and “Swinging London” screams “cheap cash-in played by anonymous session musicians”. They can’t even manage to keep the name of the group consistent: while the back of the Swinging London LP, and the labels, credit The First Impression, the front names them as The First Impressions. My first impression is: oh dear.\n\nSo can we find out anything at all about this group? A line-up, for example? Apparently not. Or perhaps somebody’s shared memories of seeing this band playing at the time? Not that I can find. I was briefly led down a dead end by a suggestion that before recording for Saga, The First Impression were signed to Pye. But no, that was a group legitimately called The First Impressions, who in 1967 were recording their own original material for Parlophone, having changed their name in the meantime to The Legends. So I think we can rule them out.\n\nThe album credits someone called Britten as writer of the First Impression songs, maybe can we track him or her down? I was initially led astray by the Discogs entry for the It’s Immaterial single, where somebody’s linked the name Britten to Terry Britten. In 1967, Terry was playing in the Australian group The Twilights, and the following year he had one of his compositions recorded by Cliff Richard, opening up a successful career as a songwriter for others with hits including Devil Woman and Carrie for Cliff, and What’s Love Got To Do With It and We Don’t Need Another Hero for Tina Turner. That he also, even by accident, penned It’s Immaterial’s debut single would be an entertaining little factoid but alas, it’s not true – as I realised when I turned to a second line of enquiry.\n\nMost of the First Impression tracks, including Young Man, credit Britten alone, but two bear a credit to Cumming / Britten – could I perhaps find this equally mysterious co-writer? That was easier: just a couple of minutes checking the various Cummings on Discogs (I didn’t bother clicking on Alan though, since while the theme song for The High Life may be a major earworm, 1967 was definitely going to be too early for him) and I was able to identify Britten’s collaborator as one David Cumming, a comedy scriptwriter with a sideline in songwriting who that same year not only supplied a B side to Kiki Dee, but even more interestingly, also released a single himself which was co-written by not Terry but John Britten. That’s our man! It looks very much like our tunesmiths are not people in a “top London beat group” – they are a producer of budget albums and a scriptwriter who both dabble in songwriting.\n\nAll of which means that honestly, I’m just not buying this “top discotheque favourites” line. I think Saga Records, looking to cash in on the mod scene, just put some session musicians in a studio and gave them a bunch of songs written to order by… well, hacks. But I still think “Young Man Seeks An Interesting Job” is a good one – even if it took It’s Immaterial to tease the quality out of it.\n\nLeon\n\nRIPPING OFF THE IDEA FROM JONNY THE FRIENDLY LAWYER\n\nJTFL, having offered up some ICAs featuring Trumpets, then went one better with an ICA made up of ten tracks in which uncommon instruments were used – Steel Drums, Theremin, Oboe, Musical Saw, Harp, Xylophone, Melodica, Spoons, Harpsichord and Mellotron.\n\nThe task I set myself was to come up with ten completely different instruments. I’ve managed it, and while there’s a few more familiar instruments involved, they are not heard on recordings on a very frequent basis. Oh, and I only had to look one of them up. Let’s starts with something Scottish……\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. Bagpipes\n\nSleep The Clock Around – Belle and Sebastian\n\nThe pipes drone their way in at the end of this, the second track of the band’s third album, The Boy With The Arab Strap. Credit is given to Ian Mackay for this one and appears to be the only song on which the piper is credited anywhere on Discogs.\n\n2. Banjo\n\nSing – Travis\n\nI’m not a musician and haven’t ever paid much attention to the origins of any instruments. I’ve always assumed the banjo came out of one of the states of America, but have now been educated and finally know that the modern take on it derives from African-style instruments brought to that part of the word by enslaved people.\n\nSing was the first single to be lifted from the album The Invisible Band and, in reaching #3 in May 2001 turned out to be the most successful 45 released by Travis. The banjo is played by their guitarist, Andy Dunlop.\n\n3. Chapman Stick\n\nI Don’t Remember – Peter Gabriel\n\nThis is the one I had to look up. I had come up with nine instruments, but reckoned that a glance at the credits on Peter Gabriel 3, released back in 1980, would throw something different up. And so it proved.\n\nThe Chapman Stick was developed in the early 70s by jazz musician Emmett Chapman. It has ten or twelve individually tuned strings and is used to play bass lines, melody lines, chords, or textures, and unlike the electric guitar, it is usually played by tapping or fretting the strings, rather than plucking them. (you can tell I’ve looked this up!!). Tony Levin, a proliic session and touring musician, was one of the first to specialise in playing the Chapman Stick and it’s his work you’ll hear on I Don’t Remember.\n\n4. Glockenspiel\n\nNo Surprises – Radiohead\n\nA rather beautiful number from OK Computer (1997) which was later released as a single and reached #4 in January 1998. The single was accompanied by a brilliant but scary video that I’m sure all of you have seen. If not, then head over to YouTube or the likes. The glockenspiel on this one is courtesy of Jonny Greenwood.\n\n5. Trombone\n\nHyperactive – Thomas Dolby\n\nIt seems that Thomas Dolby wrote this with the intention of having Michael Jackson record it. Having sent the ‘King of Pop’ a demo version but hearing nothing back, he decided to have a go at it himself, and in doing so kind of throws the kitchen sink at it, including a trombone solo from Peter Thoms\n\nSIDE B\n\n1. Accordion\n\nThis Is The Day – The The\n\nAn instrument that makes me think of France, as it seems to accompany any first sighting of the Eiffel Tower in any feature film or documentary. It’s use on this, one of my favourite songs of all time, made it a certainty for the ICA. It is played by the then 24-year-old and largely unknown Wix, but who has since become a bit of a legend as part of Paul McCartney‘s touring band since 1989.\n\n2. Mandolin\n\nWhen I’m Asleep –Butcher Boy\n\nYet another song in which the accordion introduces proceedings, this time thanks to Alison Eales. But its inclusion on the ICA is thanks to Basil Pieroni’s contribution via mandolin. It was either this or Losing My Religion, but I reckon you’re being treated to a better song.\n\n3. Harmonica\n\nFor Once In My Life – Stevie Wonder\n\nI wasn’t sure about including the harmonica in the ICA as it is quite common, relatively speaking. There are hundreds of examples out there, but I’ve settled on this rather fabulous upbeat pop single from 1968. Stevie Wonder‘s take on it is quite different from the original, as it was written as, and subsequently recorded as, a slow ballad by a number of different performers.\n\n4. Bassoon\n\nFlaming Sword – Care\n\nI knew this single from 1983 contained an unusual instrument, but I couldn’t have told you what was making the sound. But I’ve just finished reading Revolutionary Spirit: A Post-Punk Exorcism, the very enjoyable memoir penned by Paul Simpson, who among other things was one-half of Care, and he mentions, on Page 205, that it is bassoon-laden. He doesn’t say, however, who played it.\n\n5. Clarinet\n\nSay Hello Wave Goodbye – Soft Cell\n\nNot the version you all are most familiar with, either through the 7″ or 12″ singles that have been featured on the blog on many previous occasions. This is the b-side of the 7″. It’s an instrumental version. It’s rather wonderful, thanks to the two Daves – Mr Ball or synths and drum machine and Mr Tofani on clarinet.\n\nBonus Song\n\nTindersticks – No More Affairs (instrumental)\n\nIn keeping with the closing track of the ICA, here’s the b-side of a 1994 single, in which the voice of Stuart Staples is replaced by the magnificent Terry Edwards on trumpet.\n\nJC"
