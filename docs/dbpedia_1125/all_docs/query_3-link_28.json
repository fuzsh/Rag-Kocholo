        "text": "VENUES: DALHALLA\n\nArticle by Alex Davydovich (MGBH)\n\nWhether you are a piano performer, singer or a festival organizer, the choice of venue will determine at least 50% of the event’s success. In this section of Piano Performer Magazine, we present to you the most beautiful and sought after performance venues that make any performance stand out.\n\nLocated at the bottom of a quarry next to a beautiful emerald lake with potable water, Dalhalla is one of the most beautiful performance venues in the world.\n\nThe lake is on average about 2.2 m deep, and its emerald green color comes from small limestone particles in the water, which are broken by the light. With the level rising by about 15cm per week through groundwater and rainwater, the water is pumped up and led away regularly. During performances, however, the pump is used to create a spectacular fountain. The lake also serves to separate the audience from the stage. Many audience members as well as some performers have even known to swim in the lake. So, if you feel like the music makes you too hot, go ahead – cool yourself down!\n\nThe performance season at Dalhalla starts in June and ends in September. With its stage area counting over 600 square meters, the orchestra pit fitting 90 musicians, and capacity of 4100 seats, Dalhalla has been known to host such prominent pianists as Jamie Cullum (MGBH), Daniel Haglund (MGBH), Robert Wells (MGBH) and students to name a few.\n\nIf you arrive early, you will be able to enjoy the Dalhalla restaurant. With a capacity of 180 seats, it offers wine and champagne at the lounge, and sandwiches, barbecue, desserts, coffee, and tea at the restaurant.\n\nHere is a little bit of the history of Dalhalla.\n\nIn 1991, Margaret Dell Fors (MGBH), a former opera singer and radio producer, who had long been looking for a summer festival site, and Asa Nyman (MGBH), then the Head of Culture in Rättvik, discovered an abandoned limestone quarry. The location was perfect, far away from buildings, well-shielded against noise pollution from road traffic and industry. The place itself was a feast for all senses, like a scene Valhalla taken from Wagner’s world, in Dalarna – thus the name Dalhalla. In June of 1993, Margaret and Asa organized a successful test concert with invited audience, press, and TV. In August of the same year the Dalhalla Friends Association was founded.\n\nOn July 23, 1994 the first exclusive concert featuring an opera singer Birgit Nilsson (OBM), a Dalhalla Friend’s honorary chairman, took place.\n\nThe official opening of Dalhalla, with 2,600 seats initial capacity, took place on 21 June 1995 with a major opera concert. Swedish Television broadcasted the concert, and Dalhalla became known throughout the country and abroad. (1)\n\nDave Lawler (MGBH), was impressed with what he found at the facility when the jazz pianist and vocalist played at Dalhalla this past summer. “You’re going to a very remote area and don’t know what to expect, so to find a Meyer Sound system there was amazing. It’s high technology in the wilderness; quite a contrast.”\n\nThe primary house system at Dalhalla is self-powered, consisting of two Meyer Sound M2D compact curvilinear arrays of 12 cabinets each. “We knew that Meyer Sound was a reliable system,” says Park, “and its being self-powered helps make it very efficient to run and convenient to set up.” (2)\n\nReferences:\n\n(1) http://www.dalhalla.se/en/about-dalhalla/history-of-dalhalla/\n\n(2) http://www.meyersound.com/news/2007/Dalhalla/\n\nThe Art of Piano Performance: Dotan Negrin\n\nInterview by Tanya Levy (MGBH)\n\nAs I was browsing the Internet, page after page, I stumbled upon an interesting phenomenon of a pianist who turned his passion for playing piano into a life journey. Literally. He quit his day job, packed up his piano, grabbed his dog, and got on the road to play piano around the world. Five years fast-forward, here we are, with Dotan Negrin (MGBH) curious about every detail of his inspirational life-changing experience.\n\nPPM: Where did you grow up and when did you start playing piano?\n\nDN: I was born in NYC and raised in long Island. I started playing piano when I was 19 years old while studying Theater in college. I never intended to be a traveling pianist. It all happened by accident.\n\nPPM: Who were your teachers?\n\nDN: I studied with a variety of jazz teachers over the years and of course spent countless hours exploring harmony and melody on my own. One of my favorite teachers was grammy winning, Laurence Hobgood (MGBH).\n\nPPM: What was your childhood dream?\n\nDN: My childhood dream was to become a Broadway and film actor. I loved to perform and the thrill of being on stage.\n\nPPM: Tell us about your family and their influence in your life.\n\nDN: My father was born (MGBH) in Greece and my mother (MGBH) was born in Israel. Both my parents had a strong love for the arts growing up. My father would listen to a lot of opera and classical music, and my mother loved to paint. We attended many concerts and Broadway shows around New York City. My favorite was Rhapsody in Blue, because I played clarinet in middle school.\n\nPPM: Did you go to college? What is your “official” profession?\n\nDN: I went to college from 2004-2008 in Philadelphia at the University of the Arts. I got a BFA in Theater. If I had to choose and “official” labeled profession, I would consider myself a Creative Entrepreneur. I wear many hats and have a variety of skills that I have developed over the years.\n\nPPM: What was the job that you quit to start traveling with the piano, and what was the exact moment that made you decide to quit your job and embark on a piano journey?\n\nDN: I was working as a real estate agent in 2009 mainly because my father thought it would be a good idea for me to get into real estate. After 3 months I quit because I didn’t want to spend my life sitting in an office. In 2010, I got a job working as an assistant for an artist. He hired me to drive from NYC to Miami to deliver some large plexiglass photography. I thought it was great that I was getting paid to travel. I worked for him for 5 months before feeling unfulfilled again. I didn’t like that I was giving my life away to someone else at the age of 24. I believe that in your 20’s you should have the freedom to explore and take risks, especially when it comes to doing what you love.\n\nI didn’t like that I was giving my life away to someone else at the age of 24. I believe that in your 20’s you should have the freedom to explore and take risks, especially when it comes to doing what you love.\n\nAt that time I was inspired to travel the world and I wanted to figure out how I could incorporate what I learned as an actor and build a traveling performance. So I decided to start playing piano on the streets of NYC to experiment. I had such an incredible time, and I was meeting so many people from all over the world that I knew this was the dream! Eventually I bought a box truck on eBay, packed up my piano, and hit the road.\n\nPPM: When and where did you make your first trip to and how did your first traveling experience go?\n\nDN: In 2011, I traveled around the United states in 5 months and visited 36 states. My first traveling experience was scary at first, but completely liberating. It was the first time in my life where I was solo and allowed the freedom to explore without anyone telling me what I can and cannot do. I drove south to New Orleans, spent 2 weeks there. Drove to Los Angeles in 1 month, along the coast to Seattle in another month. Then I took the last month to drive back to NYC through Utah, Colorado, and the Midwest.\n\nPPM: What cities and countries have you travelled with your piano?\n\nDN: I have traveled to more than 450 cities over the last 5 years and 22 countries and 47 states. Paris, London, Amsterdam, NYC, Miami, Los Angeles, Rome, Zurich, Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Costa Rica, Mexico City…\n\nPPM: Is there a specific repertoire that you usually play? What are your favorite music pieces to play for your audiences?\n\nDN: I spent a lot of my time improvising and composing original pieces. When I arrive to beautiful locations, I like to see how the location inspires my creativity. I spent a lot of time playing Scott Joplin (OBM) Ragtime and Jazz standards. Lately I’ve been taking pop songs and rethinking them or playing them with vocalists or other instruments. My favorite thing to play is my original pieces because they come from deep inside of me and sometimes my hands take control and I like to see where they go next.\n\nMy favorite thing to play is my original pieces because they come from deep inside of me and sometimes my hands take control and I like to see where they go next.\n\nPPM: Just curious, what are the logistics of transporting the piano in your case? Have you been traveling with the same piano?\n\nDN: I have one main piano in the USA, but when I traveled to Europe, I had to purchase a used piano. I have gone through about 10 pianos over the course of 5 years. Some of the pianos I bought were not in good condition, so I would give them away and get a better one. Other times, the piano would get ruined from all the traveling.\n\nPPM: What makes you choose one city over another when you travel? Do you have a travel schedule that you set up in advance or do you just travel on a whim?\n\nDN: I usually just look at the map and see what is in the area. If there is a beautiful wooded area, I might head there based on my mood. When traveling, I usually spend Monday–Wednesday in the mountains and Thursday–Sunday in the cities to play on the streets or at venues. Sometimes, I just travel on a whim and go where my heart takes me. Improvisation is a huge part of my life.\n\nPPM: Are you planning to be home with your parents on Thanksgiving?\n\nDN: Yes, I am currently taking a break from traveling to save money and work on transitioning to doing more videos with Youtube. I live in NYC for now and will leave in the winter to go to Austin, Texas.\n\nPPM: Now that we mentioned Thanksgiving, what are some of the things you grateful for in your life?\n\nDN: I am grateful for my family and parents who shared music with me at a young age. My parents were very open about letting me explore and make my own mistakes. This journey has not been easy, and my family has always been there for me. I am also grateful to be alive in such an incredible point in time with the Internet and the ability for me to meet and connect with amazing people from all over the world.\n\nPPM: Can you share some of the funniest stories that happened to you on the road?\n\nDN: There were many incidents where people invited me to have dinner with their families. One time in Portland, ME, I met a drummer, named Daniel (MGBH), while playing piano on the street. He told me that he was going to his family reunion on a small island off the coast of Maine and invited me to join him. I was a bit unsure if I should go, but the next morning I decided to make the trip. I drove north 2 hours to a city called Rockport and took the ferry to Vinalhaven Island where I met Daniel.\n\nWe arrived at the home, and there I was having dinner with 3 generations of this family who I just met. It turned out that the entire family played a musical instrument or sang. The dinner was delicious with vegetables farmed by them and fish they caught themselves. After dinner, Daniel told me that him and his brother were playing a gig at the local bar. When I showed up at the bar, they surprised me with a keyboard and asked me to play with them. I thought I would play one song, but I ended up playing the entire 3 hour-gig with a 5-piece band. I didn’t even know any of the songs. I was just following the root notes the bass player was playing. It was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life, because all I did was say “yes” to an offer, which led me on a spontaneous journey with incredible discoveries.\n\nIt was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life, because all I did was say “yes” to an offer, which led me on a spontaneous journey with incredible discoveries.\n\nPPM: What are the logistics of your travel?\n\nDN: I mainly travel by van. The van has become my home and I’ve spent many nights sleeping in that van next to my piano. Logistically, it’s much easier than having to always look for a place to sleep, and it is certainly much cheaper. When I traveled through Europe though, I took a plane and then rented the van.\n\nPPM: Do you always travel with your girlfriend?\n\nDN: No. She came with me on 2 trips only. Sometimes I travel with my dog or with a friend.\n\nPPM: Do you use airbnb.com or mostly hotels?\n\nDN: I never use hotels or airbnb. I use couchsurfing.com to meet other travelers and stay at their house for free. I also spent a lot of time living out of my van and sleeping in the woods or in dark places. Sometimes I meet people, and they invite me to stay their home and have dinner.\n\nPPM: What has been your favorite venue to play so far?\n\nDN: My favorite places to play have been mainly been outdoors. I once played for 250 people in Peru at the Plaza Independencia, which is their main square. I played on the edge of a cliff in Big Sur as well.\n\nPPM: Who are some of the interesting people that played your piano (alone or with you)?\n\nDN: The most interesting people I’ve played piano with were the people who just came up to me and started jamming. One of them was Frans Bak – a Danish composer. Here are some videos that were captured of amazing spontaneous jam sessions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsn8ZGb80-g\n\nPPM: What is your 5 year plan?\n\nDN: My 5 year plan is to develop my skills and build my audience using the web and social media to where I am working on a variety of different projects at once. I would like to build my team who helps me create great video content that inspires people and educates people about the benefits of music in their lives. One of my biggest goals has been to have my own television show where I go on location around the world to discover how music affects different people in different parts of the world.\n\nPPM: Have you done recordings of your performances?\n\nDN: I have done many LIVE recordings of my performances and even many videos at youtube.com/pianoaround. I am currently finishing a solo piano album of cinematic recordings.\n\nPPM: Tell us about your Good Year commercial. How did it happen?\n\nDN: Goodyear saw me on National news in USA and contacted me to see if I would like to help them promote their new tires. They loved my story of traveling to go after the thing I love in life, and we collaborated on a 60-second commercial that aired in Latin America. They flew me to Costa Rica, Peru, Miami, and Mexico to perform in front of thousands of people. It was a great experience. The commercial was filmed during 4 days in Costa Rica.\n\nThose who are most successful have failed the most. So its important to keep your head up and stay focused on achieving your goals. Don’t let anyone or anything get in your way. Risk, Fail. Risk Again.\n\nPPM: Here is a boring, technical, down to earth question: How do you support yourself while traveling?\n\nDN: I support myself while traveling in a number of ways. Normally, I don’t stay in hotels, so I’ve eliminated a huge expense. I do performances on the streets of cities and in venues. I also do live streams through an app called Periscope on Facebook, which have opened up doors to new ways of making money. Social media and Youtube have also been a great way for me to support myself. I also sell merchandise and music on my web site at: pianoaround.com/store\n\nPPM:In life, at some point, each person is faced with the 2 ultimate questions: “Who am I and why I am here (on this Earth)?” Who is Dotan Negrin and why is he here?\n\nDN: I am a Storyteller. I am here to inspire and to remind the world that we are all here for a reason. I am here to inspire people to let go of fear and grab onto life and do what you love.\n\nI am a Storyteller. I am here to inspire and to remind the world that we are all here for a reason. I am here to inspire people to let go of fear and grab onto life and do what you love.\n\nPPM: You have been an inspiration to many who live in a closed box world doing the “shoulds and musts” wishing they had the strength to break out of their boundaries and limitations and follow their dreams. Can you share a few thoughts on the “how to’s”?\n\nDN: Your biggest enemy is yourself. You will talk yourself out of everything that is difficult. You can settle and spend your time doing something that you are not passionate about or you can take the leap of faith and go after what you love. You must realize that you get what you put into it. It’s the same with learning piano. The ones who are really talented have put more time into it and have spent more time practicing. The same is true with Life.\n\nThose who are most successful have failed the most. So its important to keep your head up and stay focused on achieving your goals. Don’t let anyone or anything get in your way. Risk, Fail. Risk Again.\n\nPiano Concepts: Apostol Tnokovsky, The Hydra, and The Wave\n\nInterview by Tanya Levy (MGBH)\n\nThere are many piano designs out there ranging from traditional to modern. Each one represents a unique vision of an artist reflecting his personal style. The two designs of an up and coming talented Macedonian product designer Apostol Tnokovsky (MGBH) strike us with their elegance as well as unique and original form. We have reached out to author of these concepts to find out more.\n\nPPM: There has been a lot of hype on the Internet about your gorgeous piano designs – both Hydra and Wave. Have you been approached by piano companies to actually start manufacturing these designs? Has there been a prototype made?\n\nAT: I have been in communication with several manufacturers, both big and small custom piano builders, but nothing serious came out of it as of yet. I’m still in contact, however, with few other companies, and I truly believe that one day the pianos will be produced. A time ago, I’ve collaborated with a local company. They’ve built a 1:5 downscaled model of the Wave piano, just to calculate the production costs. At the end, it came out that I only had a budget to customize a low end piano model. However, besides a beautiful design, I want a perfect sound as well, so I decided to wait for a better opportunity.\n\nPPM: While we know that the inspiration for Hydra was Lady Gaga’s (MGBH) performance and her boxy outdated piano, what was the inspiration for the Wave?\n\nAT: The Wave piano is also inspired by a famous pop artist, but this time I didn’t want to publicly link it to a celebrity. I learned from my experience with the Hydra piano. I announced that the concept was inspired by Lady Gaga, and everybody expected that she would play it in her next music video. So I don’t want the same kind of pressure with the Wave concept design. In the past few years I’ve been approached by many music artists, TV producers, hotel managers, event managers who requested my pianos, but I haven’t found a way to produce them yet.\n\nPPM: While we can see the outer design of both pianos, how are they designed inside? Are they both acoustically sound?\n\nAT: Both concepts are designed as stage pianos for pop artists, and their primary goal is to create strong visual impact on the stage. Certainly, they have to sound perfect, but there is no major innovation in the sound. The Hydra piano should be created as typical body customization of existing piano, and for the Wave piano a more complicated operation is required to adapt the whole existing acoustic mechanism into the slimmer casing, but for sure it can be done.\n\nPPM: How much would it cost to make each piano? What materials did you design them to be made out of?\n\nAT: Both pianos should be made out of wood. With the Wave design we metal arc stands. The companies that I’ve consulted gave me a price range from $100, 000-120, 000 for the Wave, and $150,000-180,000 for the Hydra. These prices are for customization of a premium brand piano model. The price that I got for the Wave form the local company that made the downscaled model, was around 35, 000 € for customization of low end piano model.\n\nPPM: You designed beautiful products besides pianos. Which ones of them can we see on the market?\n\nAT: I’ve done some things for a few local businesses in Macedonia. Internationally, I designed a collection of shoes and bags for the Italian brand WMATY. There are a few concepts pending for production, but I rather not talk about them until they are on the market.\n\nPPM: Please, describe your creative process. Where do you generally find your inspiration?\n\nAT: I don’t believe there is a formula to a creative process. Sometimes is hard to find a solution. You think for days and nights until you get to the right idea, but sometimes you just get inspired by moments in life, and the idea strikes you like lightning. The ideas for my best concepts came to me out of nowhere…from some place up in the skies.\n\nI don’t believe there is a formula to a creative process. Sometimes is hard to find a solution. You think for days and nights until you get to the right idea, but sometimes you just get inspired by moments in life, and the idea strikes you like lightning. The ideas for my best concepts came to me out of nowhere…from some place up in the skies.\n\nPPM: Do you travel a lot?\n\nAT: I really like to travel, but I also like being home. So, sometimes, at the last moment I try to find an excuse not to go on a trip. But, luckily, I have my wife, and she is more of an action person. She even sometimes arranges our trips without telling me. I’m so happy to have her in my life.\n\nPPM: What are your hobbies?\n\nAT: I love watching movies, playing video games. I’m a true fan of Manchester United. I try not to miss a game. In the past year, however, my primary hobby has been my 1-year-old daughter I’m so grateful to have her and try to spend as much as I can of my free time with her.\n\nPPM: What personal and professional qualities do you consider to be essential factors of success?\n\nAT: Talent and persistence… Some say it’s hard work, but if you don’t have talent for something, if you don’t have that special thing, that “X” factor, you can work hard day and night to achieve the level of above average. I bet that there are basketball players that train a 100 times harder that Michael Jordan (MBGH) does, but his talent has made him stand out as the best player in history. Of course, nothing is easy in life. Sometimes things don’t run as smoothly as we would like them to, but you always have to be persistent and never give up on your dream.\n\nSometimes things don’t run as smoothly as we would like them to, but you always have to be persistent and never give up on your dream.\n\nPPM: Do you have a role model?\n\nAT: I must say, Luigi Colani (MGBH). I admire his freedom of expression. So far I haven’t seen anyone with a style so strongly defined as his. He is a rear artist who has managed to stay true to himself, to his style, and his believes. I’m trying hard to do this, but I don’t think that I can ever achieve such freedom of expression as him.\n\nPPM: What is your dream as a designer?\n\nAT: To make an impact on the world by making it easier and more beautiful place to live in and to be an inspiration to other talented people around the world to do their best to succeed.\n\nAs a designer, I’m truly obsessed with the shape of a sphere – it’s perfect in every way.\n\nPPM: How, in your opinion, form/object shape effects consciousness? How does it effect you?\n\nAT: Well, if we analyze ourselves as customers, the shape of the objects has a big influence on our choices. A shape of a product is the first thing that attracts us towards them. As a designer, I’m truly obsessed with the shape of a sphere – it’s perfect in any way. On the other hand, I like to use very fluid and organic forms in my designs and to mimic nature as much as I can.\n\nPPM: Have you approached Lady Gaga or her management with your piano design?\n\nAT: I’ve talked to few people close to her. They liked the concept very much, and the plan is to include the piano in the future for a project (concert stage, music video) where it would fit properly. Let’s face it: she is one of the biggest pop artists of our time, so I guess I have to be patient.\n\nI believe that anything in this world is possible. I don’t believe that as creative person you are blessed with a good idea without a reason. I think that every one of us has a small part in the great Divine plan. So you have to be patient, and everything will fit into place. Sometimes it takes a very long time and it’s frustrating, but you must have hope and never give up.\n\nPPM: In your opinion, what are the factors that affect the process of materializing an idea or concept?\n\nAT: I believe that anything in this world is possible. I don’t believe that as creative person you are blessed with a good idea without a reason. I think that every one of us has a small part in the great Divine plan. So, you have to be patient, and everything will fit into place. Sometimes it takes a very long time, and it’s frustrating, but you must have hope and never give up.\n\nPPM: How important is team effort in your work?\n\nAT: It’s very important… I have the idea, but I do not know all the processes for all the products I’ve designed. So, many times I have to consult and work with people from different fields and trust their expertise.\n\nPPM: Did you play any music instruments growing up? Do you play now?\n\nAT: I took some guitar lessons when I was younger…I play my acoustic guitar from time to time, but my playing is on a very amateur level, so I don’t have an intention gathering a band any time soon. 🙂\n\nI took some guitar lessons when I was younger…I play my acoustic guitar from time to time, but my playing is on a very amateur level, so I don’t have an intention gathering a band any time soon. 🙂\n\nPPM: What meaning does music have in your life? What kinds of music do you like to listen to?\n\nAT: Music has impact on everybody’s life…As Dick Clark (MGBH) said,”The music that you listen, is the soundtrack of your life”. Can you imagine a film without soundtrack? It would be boring and plain. As for the kinds of music I listen to… I love the Beatles, and I also like jazz artists like Miles Davies (OBM), Duke Ellington (OBM), and Charlie Parker (OBM).\n\nPPM: Many people associate piano with classical music and classical period. How do you think piano design affects perceptions and expectation of the type of music played on it?\n\nAT: As the music changes over the years, the design for the instruments that is played on should change correspondingly. It is true that the classical piano is used for playing classical music, and for the classical music the most important thing is the perfection of sound. But when it comes to modern pop music, the instruments on stage should be modern, too. I believe that on a pop stage every element should contribute to the visual impact of the show.\n\nPPM: Do you have a joke?\n\nAT: The Father says to his Son, “Son, I’m going to pay you 10$ a day if you practice your piano.” Son, “Sorry, Dad…The neighbor already pays me $15 a day not to.”\n\nSee more of Apostol Tnokovsky’s designs here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/13685405\n\nSHARING IS CARING: Pre-Screening Auditions\n\nArticle by Michael Refvem (MGBH)\n\nWith the end of the summer festival season, a new school year has arrived, and for many young pianists so has the college application process. Perhaps, the most important aspect of applying for music schools is the pre-screening recording that determines which applicants are invited for a live audition in the winter. With the level of competition higher than ever to be accepted to prestigious schools, the level of professionalism behind your recording can make the difference in being invited to audition or being rejected.\n\nBeing new to this process can feel daunting. From a young age, we, pianists, are trained to focus on just one thing – our playing. But in this modern world, it isn’t enough anymore to just play one’s instrument. You need to also have knowledge of other aspects of the music industry, where the art of recording is one of the key aspects.\n\nThere is something sacred about the recording process. All is silent in the hall, you press “go” and wait a few seconds, absorbing the silence. Then, when the moment is right, the music takes over. Unlike in a live performance where the audience is, to an extent, also a participant in the activity, recording is all about the pursuit of perfection, seeking your definitive interpretation and setting it down for all time.\n\nYou’ll be surprised at first to hear your recording. The way we perceive our playing when it is happening often isn’t the same as the audience perceives it.\n\nWHAT TO PLAY\n\nI would recommend only setting your most comfortable, well-tested pieces to record. Try recording yourself on a regular basis so that by the time you get set to make your final recordings, you feel centered and ready to go. You’ll be surprised at first to hear your recording. The way we perceive our playing when it is happening often isn’t the same as the audience perceives it. You might notice strange tempo fluctuations or that your range of dynamics needs to be improved.\n\nRECORDING TIMELINE\n\nWith most pre-screening recordings due alongside the applications for many schools on December 1st, I would recommend doing your recordings well before the due date. October is a really good time to record, and it can be helpful to do a live recital a few weeks before to make sure your pieces are really ready to go. Setting your music to record a few months before the due date also gives you the chance to do the recordings again a few weeks later if you discovered that you weren’t ready.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nOf course, it helps to have a well-maintained piano of the highest quality possible. Of course, if you’re still in high school working on college pre-screening recordings, your best options may be a church or a local piano dealer. See if the manager will let you do some of your recordings after normal business hours.\n\nOn the day of the recording, it is worth it to play around with the arrangement of objects on stage and the lighting in the room. It also helps the overall production your playing to dress professionally. Treat this like an actual performance!\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nRecording equipment (cameras, microphones, tripods) is usually available for check out from the technology center at your school, meaning this can be done for cheap.\n\nMake sure to test out all of the equipment a few days before you record to make sure you are familiar with the set up. Some microphone systems require a ‘mixer’ that plugs into your computer (essentially a device that helps the microphones communicate with your computer). There are also some microphones that require what is known as “phantom power.” Without the phantom power switched on, your microphones will not actually pick up your performance. Try to familiarize yourself with GarageBand if you own a Mac or a related program so you aren’t trying to learn this for the first time on the day of the recording. Video cameras should also be tested a few days early so that you are familiar with the recording mechanism. Once I turned on the camera and played for about an hour and a half only to discover that the camera stopped recording after 30 minutes because it was on the wrong setting! Be sure to check the settings for automatic shut offs. You want to make sure that you have all of your bases covered prior to recording.\n\nOnce I turned on the camera and played for about an hour and a half only to discover that the camera stopped recording after 30 minutes because it was on the wrong setting!\n\nThe placement of your equipment during the recording is also an important factor to consider. I had the best result when I placed the microphones about 4-5 feet away from the piano. Having the microphones at this distance from the piano allowed for the sound to blend with the natural acoustic of the room without sacrificing the clarity of attack. Placing the microphones too close to the strings works with some types of microphones, but I found that it creates a sound that is shrill and bright. Placing the microphones too far away from the instrument results in a warm quality of sound, but the music itself sounds washed-out. On the day of the recording, you should expect the set up to take at least an hour in order to arrange the equipment and balance the microphones. The input level should be set as high as possible without “clipping” the sound and tripping the feedback detector; you should play the loudest sections of your pieces when testing the microphones to attain the right balance. If the input is set too low, then the recording will not register a very wide range of dynamics.\n\nFor the camera, you’re going to want to make sure you can see your whole body in the pre-screening video, and especially the hands must be easily visible. The most conventional position to film is the pianist’s profile, but one time I experimented with setting up the camera way up high over my left shoulder and was quite satisfied because it provided such a great view of my hands (see my self-produced video of Liszt’s 13th Hungarian Rhapsody on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZDA5H6ops).\n\nTHIRD TIME’S THE CHARM\n\nIn my experience, if you haven’t gotten the take you hoped for by the third try, it probably isn’t going to happen that day. I have found that two things could result from putting in too many tries. First, continued takes will put a strain on your concentration and the mistakes will begin to multiply. The second thing that may happen is that you finally achieve that note-perfect performance only to listen back and realize that the expression was flat. You’ll be surprised how many times I listened back to my own takes just to realize that the first take was actually where I played with the most vitality.\n\nSHOULD YOU HAVE A HELPER?\n\nI have found that I perform at my best when I am uninhibited by time restraints. Having others around causes me to feel concerned about how the process is taking up a lot of their time. Of course, it can really help to have someone more experienced with the recording process around, but once you get the hang of things, it is best to manage it alone. I have also found that it isn’t always necessary to stop recording in between movements or entire pieces. If you think the extra step of getting up from the piano bench to stop the recording is distracting, then keep recording.\n\nRemember that, above all else, you want this recording to capture the essence of who you are as a musician.\n\nEDITING\n\nMany schools require pre-screenings to be submitted as a video in addition to the audio to ensure no cheating took place. This video should be submitted without any cuts, but it doesn’t hurt to use iMovie to put some credits and a fade-in at the beginning.\n\nRemember that, above all else, you want this recording to capture the essence of who you are as a musician. The faculty are really looking for somebody who plays with a lot of expression and personality, and who seems very dedicated to the music. They aren’t necessarily looking for perfection, so get out there and have fun while you play!\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nMichael Refvem enjoys a multifaceted career as recitalist, chamber musician and concerto soloist. He recently moved to Montréal, where he enjoys walks in the old town and Mount Royal in his spare time.\n\nGENERATION Z: The Story of Yoav\n\nInterview by Esther Basha (MGBH)\n\nThe 21st Century has brought us many piano child prodigies from all over the world. A young Israeli pianist, Yoav Levanon’s (MGBH), however, with experience of performing at Carnegie Hall at 7, prefers not to be labeled as such. After an interview with Yoav, I understood why. His answers are full of insight and maturity. As one music critic referred to him as a “big artist in a small body.” Now, it is your turn to discover Yoav Levanon.\n\nPPM: What is your life like in Israel?\n\nYL: I live in Israel in a small village, a peaceful environment, where farmers cultivate the land. Around my house, I hear the birds singing, and I can just walk between strawberries and oranges, water melons and avocados. Just name the time in the year, and I will tell you what we have around my house. I have a very supportive family and a lovely cat Archibal. I have friends among school mates and other musicians. Some of my musician friends live abroad and meet with me during masterclasses in Europe.\n\nI practice each and every day. I play long hours. I know what I want to achieve and when my practice is more effective or less effective.\n\nPPM: When and with whom did you first start learning to play piano? How many hours a day do you practice? Do you practice every day? What is your practice routine?\n\nYL: Ever since I remember myself, I have always played piano. Professionally, with a piano teacher, I started just little over 3. I knew how to read notes and rhythm before I knew all the numbers…. I practice each and every day. I play long hours. I know what I want to achieve and when my practice is more effective or less effective. I do not have to watch the clock. The most important is to listen to myself and to obtain the sound and music that I feel inside. Practicing for me is more than just to play what’s written and by following the teachers. I have a vision for each piece that I must achieve. When I achieve it, I feel that I express something that is special, unique for me and my vision of the piece.\n\nPPM: Do you have a favorite composer? Who is it and why?\n\nYL: It is very strange, but I lately noticed that almost all my favorite composers have the letter “H” in their names: I like Chopin (OBM), Bach (OBM), Beethoven (OBM), Brahms (OBM), Schubert (OBM), Schumann (OBM), Mendelssohn (OBM), Tchaikovsky (OBM), Rachmaninoff (OBM)……… but I also like to play pieces by Liszt (OBM), Debussy (OBM), Frank (OBM), Scriabin (OBM), Bartok (OBM), Prokofiev (OBM), Kapustin (OBM) …… I am always intrigued by new pieces that I play. I am amazed by the beauty, the wisdom or the feeling and/or complexity. So many beautiful pieces and great composers to admire. I probably have to grow up until I may answer this question fully. Or, maybe, they are all great and I never pick just one as “favorite” trying to avoid being “unfair” to others.\n\nI like to fly remote controlled helicopters and drones. I like reading. When having some more time – work on my Lego robot and Arduino kit, an electronics platform for making interactive projects.\n\nPPM: What are your hobbies?\n\nYL: I like to fly remote controlled helicopters and drones. I like reading. When having some more time – work on my Lego robot and Arduino kit, an electronics platform for making interactive projects.\n\nPPM: How often do you travel?\n\nYL: I travel for masterclasses and performances. I learn from my parents that they get a lot of proposals to perform in different countries as well as to participate in masterclasses and competitions. We speak about such opportunities. We pick up very few that can contribute to advancing me and enriching my professional experience. Both Mom and Dad support me on my travels. More often I am accompanied by my Mom.\n\nPPM: Which performance was your favorite so far and why?\n\nYL: My performance at the San Carlo Theater in Naples, Italy. I love the Chopin concerto no 1. It was amazing to perform it with maestro Daniel Oren (OBM) in front of a fully crowded and magnificent theater. I was invited to perform as an adult artist (under highly rewarding contract). I had admiring audience that was captivated by the music and amazing critics after the performance.\n\nI would be nervous if I am pushed to play when I feel that I am not ready. Therefore, I always care to prepare myself to the point that I am satisfied, before any performance. When on the stage, I take the time, before the start of the performance, for quick, silent, “mind” rehearsal that help for concentration and shift into the music smoothly.\n\nPPM: How do you feel when people compliment about your performance?\n\nYL: The feedback of the people is an important reward after a performance. I had many occasions when people were coming to shake my hands with tears in their eyes after the concert. This is the highest reward – I knew that I touched their inner feelings and made them happy.\n\nPPM: Do you play other types of music besides classical? Do you write your own music?\n\nYL: I like to hear classic music, opera and jazz. Yet, I do concentrate on classical music. Being focused on classical music performance, beside my love to the different pieces and composers, gives me the opportunity to best master the piano.\n\nI compose my own music, for my personal joy, but I have not yet recorded any of it.\n\nPPM: Do you ever get nervous before a performance?\n\nYL: I am lucky that I always liked the stage and performing in front of audience. I would be nervous if I am pushed to play when I feel that I am not ready. Therefore, I always care to prepare myself to the point that I am satisfied, before any performance. When on the stage, I take the time, before the start of the performance, for a quick, silent, “mind” rehearsal that helps concentration and shifts me into the music smoothly.\n\nIt was amazing to play at 7 at the Carnegie Hall in New York.\n\nPPM: What countries have you traveled to with your performances so far? What has been your favorite traveling experience?\n\nYL: I played in the US, Hungary, Italy, and Israel. I enjoyed all performances and traveling. It is so difficult to point out a specific one……let me think… It was amazing to play at 7 at the Carnegie Hall in New York. And it was a unique experience to play with the Franz Liszt Orchestra at the Europe’s biggest synagogue in Budapest….And the tour in Israel with maestro Vladimir Spivakov (MGBH) and the “Moscow Virtuosi,” not to mention the latest performance in the most beautiful San Carlo Theater in Naples, Italy. Every one is a sweet memory and can be the favorite one :).\n\nPPM: Do you play any other instruments?\n\nYL: I have natural opera singing capabilities. Some people that hear me think that I take part in singing and opera performances. I can also demonstrate beatbox complex rhythms performance. As a whole, my voice is my second instrument.\n\nPPM: What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?\n\nYL: To be able to best perform each piano piece and join the elite club of top piano performers.\n\nPPM: Do you have a joke or a funny story to share?\n\nYL: Oh, I have plenty curios stories, also from the young ages… here are a couple of them…\n\nOnce when I was 5-6 years old I was asked to perform for some guests. When everyone was seated and ready to listen to the “concert,” I insisted on turning down the lights claiming that: “As I feel it, this piece has to be played only in the darkness.” They asked me what I was going to play. It was the Nocturne by Chopin in C-sharp minor. The the audience’s surprise, I played it almost in a complete darkness. A few years later I learned the definition of “Nocturne” – “a musical composition that is inspired by, or evocative of, the night”.\n\nOnce I ate the piano…. literally…\n\nOnce I ate the piano…. literally…\n\nWhen I just turned 5, I won my first National Piano Competition, and my teacher gave me as a present a tiny little grand piano. It was a real piano – with the keys, and legs, and everything, but, it was made of … black and white chocolate. I kept it for a while and finally ….I had to eat it. (So, I ate it).\n\nSince then, I can truly say, that I play, live, breathe and …(sometimes even) eat the piano.\n\nAnd also, I have pretty funny story that happened to me just lately, at my last stay for playing concert in Italy.\n\nI had to play two concerts, day after day. After my first concert I ran to a restaurant to grab my lasagna before they would close. The waiter, who already recognized me from a day before, asked about my father who was missing. Along with my lasagna, the waiter brought the San Carlo season’s program, saying, “You, probably, do not like classic music, but, you should join your father as there is a great music in the theater.” When he opened the brochure to show me the great music events that are scheduled, he saw my picture all over the second page. We could not stop laughing when he was telling the story to everyone in the restaurant……..it was hilarious.\n\nMember Spotlight: Samuel Quinto – The Master of Latin Jazz\n\nInterview by Tanya Levy (MGBH)\n\nWith this issue of Piano Performer Magazine, we are starting a new section featuring members of American Council of Piano Performers (ACPP). ACPP is a non-profit professional membership organization for US and International piano professionals based out of Beverly Hills, CA. The Piano Performer Magazine is the latest project of ACPP.\n\nMr. Samuel Quinto is the first International ACPP member to be featured in this magazine.\n\nPPM: You left college where you pursued a degree in civil engineering to follow your musical dream. What was that “Aha!” moment when you realized “It’s either now or never”?\n\nSQ: When I was twenty-four, my sister put my name on the list at the college. I had to take a test to get in, and I passed. So, in January, I started my studies, but I never liked it. I didn’t enjoy engineering, but I did, however, enjoy playing music. In Salvador, we don’t have too many places to play piano. So that’s why I went to school—it wasn’t because I liked it, it was more to fit in.\n\nWanting for me to have a stable career, my family pushed me towards engineering, but the pull of music was too great. Then I received an invitation. I left my schooling to perform as a pianist nightly at The Marriott Hotel in Bahia. I focused on my music with a passion, studying Brazilian piano greats such as Cesar Camargo Mariano (MGBH) and Amilton Godoy (MGBH).\n\nPPM:What was it like producing your first CD? Please, share your experience with our readers.\n\nSQ: It was wonderful and very intense. I lived in Portugal for three years. Every morning I taught jazz piano at a school. In the afternoon I worked as a pianist in a ballet company and the night played in hotels, casinos, and pubs. A good friend of mine, a drummer named Gil (MGBH) gave me the suggestion to form a trio with a friend bass player named Alexandre Silva. I thought this idea was wonderful because my mind would simmer with wonderful thoughts and new ideas every day. As there was no specific job Latin Jazz in Portugal until then, we decided to go this way. Alexandre wasn’t able to follow up on it so we invited Edamir Costa who kindly accepted our invitation. We decided to record a demo CD, which contained 4 pieces to get a record label. The Numérica label suggested that the trio should record new material as well as other previously recorded tracks. Latin Jazz Thrill was released in 2007.\n\nPPM: Many pianists/musicians seem to have a goal to make it big vs. finding pleasure in sharing their talent with the audience organically available to them. Why do you think that is?\n\nSQ: I feel that anything that is not measured cannot be managed. All projects should be measure by appropriate indicators according your project evolution. You may love to make music regardless of the number of people in the audience. This shows that a project was done for career development and you need to maintain an attitude of balance and a certain strategic flexibility.\n\nPPM: In your experience, what is the ratio of personality vs. talent as a factor of career success?\n\nSQ: No doubt the personality far exceeds the talent. There are many talented artists who are unknown and they seem very well accommodated in this situation. What will boost your career is strong willpower. Remember that in adversity you have found strength that will carry you far in your career.\n\nPPM: What is your professional goal?\n\nSQ: I’m always looking for great challenges. Earlier this year my father was hospitalized by 21 consecutive days and I was there with him. I just get up one day and say, I’m going to write an improvisation method book and I was doing it while I spent every night at the hospital. It was a great challenge because I did not feel capable to do that. There is a very big difference between to teach and to write in an organized manner, in a way that everything looks very easy. This will serve to show that you must know your goals and do the right programing in order to achieve them.\n\nPPM: What is the biggest challenge for you as a musician?\n\nSQ: The biggest challenge is to achieve a continuous, ascending creative process among many commitments and activities.\n\nPPM: When and how did your first introduction to piano happened? Who were your teachers? What methods did they use in teaching you?\n\nSQ: I grew up in a Baptist family so, I got into music through the church. We had many groups that played gospel music in my church. I grew up listening to this type of music, and it made me a specialist in it. In my church, I played piano, guitar, drums, bass, and saxophone—whatever I could get my hands on.\n\nI’m self-taught; I never had classes on piano or any other instrument. My parents didn’t have the conditions to allow them to pay for classes for me.\n\nPPM: Where do you live now?\n\nSQ: I live in countryside of the state of São Paulo in a beautiful and calm city named Atibaia around 65 kilometers away from the city of São Paulo. With a wide veranda overlooking the mountains, my house is a place to be in contact with Nature.\n\nPPM: Please, describe a typical week in the life of Samuel Quinto.\n\nSQ: I am grateful I can be home almost every morning there I stay with my wife Larissa, our baby Elis (1 year and 4 months of age), our dog Azul that means Blue in Portuguese and our cat Buchito. In the afternoons I have many commitments. I have activities ranging from writing to All About Jazz reviews, interviews to the Royal Society of Arts. I write arrangements on request for choir and orchestra. I work also with musical production. Have sometime to practice piano for my solo concerts. I’m working on my new musical that shows some Atibaia’s historical period. I give masterclasses and workshops usually taking place on the weekend. I have a company with a partner and great friend of mine Eng. Daniel Silas. We work with acoustic treatment project.\n\nPPM: Is there a specific musician that you would like to collaborate with?\n\nSQ: There are several! But I would love to play with Bobby McFerrin. I’m a huge fan!\n\nPPM: What does creativity in piano performance mean to you?\n\nSQ: It means putting your soul on public display. I think creativity is closely associated not only the techniques studied, but rather a challenge to balance them in your mind as you feel the music.\n\nPPM: Do you have a piano joke or a funny story that happened to you?\n\nSQ: I have a lot! LOL! Once was teaching a group of children in a Baptist church here in Brazil, I showed some photos of me in concert in Europe in order to motivate them to study harder to get going further. I asked them: Do you know why I’m showing these pictures? A little girl answered like this: To humiliate us. The children and I had many laughs together.\n\nPPM: Tell us about your classical compositions.\n\nSQ: My first symphonic composition, written in 2011, was the Symphony No. 1 in A flat Major “Pascha Aeternam” for the Orchestra, Chorus and soloists in 4 movements, that has emphasis on Easter. I wrote the Christmas Oratorio for Choir in 5 voices and Symphony Orchestra; my second symphony, the Symphony 2 in C Minor, titled “Symphony Lightly Beautiful” for choir and Orchestra in five voices, yet the Motet Angelical, inspired by the Bruckner’s motets in 5 voices; string quartets; Opera Samson and Delilah (unfinished), Minuets and preludes.\n\nIn 2013, I adapted the Symphony No. 1 for the opera format. Opera Pascha Aeternam has in its structure with theater, classical and modern ballet, choir and soloists a total staff of 148 people, and it was presented at the Second Baptist Church in Mossoro, as well as the Municipal Theater Dix-Huit Rosado for a total estimated audience more than 1,500 people, receiving rave reviews in RN state newspapers.\n\nPPM: Let’s talk about a spiritual aspect of music and Latin Jazz in particular. How does music affect you on a spiritual level?\n\nSQ: It is very easy to see how we are affected by music. Since ancient times it has been observed how music has the power to connect people to God. I understand that music is a language created by God. I use many of my compositions as a form of gratitude to Him allowing me to understand a little of this language every day more and more.\n\nPPM: How does a family life get integrated into a busy schedule of a piano performer? Do you have a family? How do you see yourself balancing both?\n\nSQ: It took me a lot to reach this stage I Am. Now I know enough to balance the time dedicated to my family. My daughter loves to play the piano with me. She plays a few notes in a language that still can not understand very well, but I think one day I will get.\n\nPPM:What would you like your fans to know about you?\n\nSQ: I wanted everyone to know that I love learning about new cultures, talk to people around the world, helping people in their musical development and learn from the experiences of each of them. That’s why my contact is on my website so we can talk, meet people who have a lot of value to add not only to me and my music, but also to the society.\n\nPPM: What are your hobbies besides piano?\n\nSQ: I love to practice sports! I play soccer, volleyball and tennis. I love cinema, theater and go to the beach.\n\nClick here to see Samuel Quinto’s profile on www.pianoperformers.org:\n\nFeature Interview: Elisso Bolkvadze\n\nInterview by Esther Basha (MGBH)\n\nA recent recipient of prestigious UNESCO Award Artists for Peace, the beautiful Elisso Bolkvadze (MGBH) juggles her busy life of an internationally recognized piano performer, organizer of Batumi Music Fest, Director of Lyra Charitable Foundation for young musicians and Co-Director of Michel Sogny’s (MGBH) SOS Talents Foundation. Does she have time to stop and smell the roses? We caught Ms. Bolkvadze during one of her rare quiet moments for a feature interview.\n\nPPM: Please, tell our readers how you grew up. Who introduced you to music? Who were/are your parents? Did you grandparents play any instruments?\n\nEB: I was born and raised as the only child in a family of intellectuals, where poetry and literature was highly cherished.Both of my parents were very enlightened. My mom worked as an editor of an academic journal, where she was translating world literature to Georgian language. My dad was an editor of humor magazine – “Niangi” (Crocodile), founded in 1931. It was quite an acclaimed edition during the Soviet period, well known for its satire and high quality literature work. I am really blessed and proud to be a daughter of my parents. Neither my parents nor my grandparents played any instruments or where related to the music industry. I was fascinated by music and singing since early age, so my mother decided to take me to music classes. My mother is still alive, while my beloved father has passed away.\n\nPPM: When did you know that you wanted to become a professional pianist?\n\nEB: I, actually, never aimed to become a professional pianist. I just had this enormous love and desire towards music that led me to where I am now.\n\nPPM: Is there one single person that had a profound effect on your life, career, life views?\n\nEB: Yes, there are two people who truly influenced my life and career. Firstly, my dear father, who was a great role model for me his entire life. Secondly, Michel Sogny (MGBH), whom I met in Paris in 1995 during the Marguerite Long competition. He is an exemplary professor, philosopher, writer, musician, and composer. He is also the founder of a unique approach to piano learning, which I highly support. His method is simple, motivating, and makes piano learning enjoyable.\n\nPPM: Do you have a family of your own?\n\nEB: No, unfortunately, I don’t have a family of my own as of yet.\n\nPPM: From your interviews that I have read so far, I could tell that you are very a grounded person. What helps you stay grounded?\n\nEB: I am flattered and happy if I came across as a grounded person. That is a compliment for me. Probably, modesty is the outcome of my upbringing. My career achievements never effected my personality, as since early age I had defined beliefs and vision. Success is good, but it never had an impact on my character.\n\nPPM: What is the biggest difference of being an artist in the Soviet Union vs. in the post- Soviet space?\n\nEB: There are both positive and negative sides of being an artist in the Soviet Union. In my opinion, the positive side was being managed under one system, which functioned on its own. Artists did not have to struggle individually to achieve exposure and recognition. The system was centralized. The negative side was that this very centralized management had a total power. The leaders of the system would decide who was allowed perform during festivals and concerts. At present, we have to take care of ourselves. We have to work hard and be creative to be distinguished. We need to develop on our own to realize our potential.\n\nPPM: In what ways do you consider the art of piano performance therapeutic?\n\nEB: I truly believe that music is therapeutic. I would say piano performance is especially therapeutic by putting a listener as well as a performer into a serene state of mind. It gives us peace and balance. It gives us an opportunity to completely detach from reality.\n\nPPM: Do you connect your craft with spirituality and your relationship with the divine energy of Light /G-d?\n\nEB: Yes, I do. I almost always feel proximity to the Divine while performing at concerts. I vividly remember the two occasions when I was on stage in a complete trance. I was totally consumed by music. I have to point out, however, that I experience this state while only performing on stage, and not during the practice sessions. This feeling is indescribable. You feel this lightness in your body, and music sounds so rich…\n\nPPM: Would you agree with a statement that there are music pieces that help performers connect with their female energy and those that help them connect to their male energy? If so, how do you integrate this concept into your choice of repertoire?\n\nEB: Yes, I do agree. I would say objectively there are some music pieces that are more suitable for male performers like, for instance, Prokofiev’s (OBM) Sonata #7 and 2nd concerto, Tchaikovsky’s (OBM) Piano Concerto #1, and Stravinsky’s (OBM) Petrushka. I choose my repertoire based on my personality and prefer music pieces that I can identify with.\n\nPPM: Who is your favorite Georgian composer?\n\nEB: My favorite composer is Zaqaria Paliashvili (OBM). He composed outstanding opera pieces including Abesalom & Eteri & “Daisi”.\n\nPPM: Do you have a daily routine when you are not traveling? What is your day usually like?\n\nEB: Nowadays, I don’t have much of a routine. I always plan in advance, and everything still changes last minute. Even if I wanted to follow the schedule, it’s impossible. Being an Artistic Director of Batumi Music Fest, I juggle that with directing Lyra – a charitable foundation, which aims to help young talents in Georgia, along with SOS Talents Foundation of Michel Sogny. I am also adjusting to my duties as a UNESCO Artist for Peace. My day is quite busy consisting of numerous phone calls, never ending emails, and piano performances.\n\nPPM: What are your favorite foods? Can you name some of the traditional Georgian dishes that you cannot do without?\n\nEB: My favorite Georgian food is Khachapuri. This is basically a dough with cheese that looks like Pizza but doesn’t have toppings. It’s delicious! I absolutely love Georgian traditional cuisine. We also have a dish, which is primarily made for New Year’s, called “Satsivi” – chicken or turkey in walnuts sauce. A must try!\n\nPPM: As a founder and organizer of the Batumi festival, what was your main challenge the first time around? In your opinion, what are the key ingredients of a successful festival?\n\nEB: I have to admit I could never imagine the amount of obstacles I would have to face while planning the Batumi Music Fest. Honestly if I knew what it takes I would never go through with it. But year after year our team became more and more professional. We overcame difficulties and gained experience. We try to never make same mistake twice. Batumi Music Fest received appreciation and positive feedback among audience. And this keeps us going. One of the reasons we gained recognition is through a distinguished program. I would also add that the key to success lies in good marketing. It is really important.\n\nPPM: Do you teach piano? If so, what method do you use?\n\nEB: Yes, I often give Master Classes. I always follow and introduce the method of Michel Sogny, which gives a unique and instant outcome.\n\nPPM: Can you recall any funny stories that happened to you during your performances, travels, or while teaching?\n\nEB: Yes! One time I had to perform in Washington at the Kennedy Center. This was approximately 12 years ago. I flew through Moscow when at the airport they confiscated my visa and told me I was not able to take my flight. There was a huge misunderstanding and I had to spend the night at the airport undocumented. Finally, hours later, they let me on board. I arrived to the States two hours before my concert and went directly to the Kennedy Center to perform. I will never forget this experience.\n\nPPM: You are currently represented by IMG Artists. How important, in your opinion, is it for a piano performer to have an agent/manager/publicist?\n\nEB: IMG Artists is a great agency. It’s important to be represented by a good agency, but, once again, I believe it’s very important as well to work on ourselves as we define our destiny. Being active is vital.\n\nPPM: Where do you currently live?\n\nEB: I currently live in Paris. I find myself incredibly lucky to live in Paris. Paris is the city for everyone! Everyone desires to visit Paris and living here is a great opportunity!\n\nREVISITING HISTORY: The Story of Anna Magdalena Bach\n\nArticle by Jacqueline Leung (MGBH)\n\nIn this issue of Piano Performer Magazine, we are inviting you to revisit history and look at Anna Magdalena Bach (OBM), the second wife of the Grand Maestro, from a different angle. A wife, a mother, an accomplished musician in her own merit, she intrigues and sparks curiosity. Her story makes us realize that an idea of a musically accomplished woman in addition to her traditional role of a nurturer is not a concept so exclusive to modernity. Or, perhaps, she was one of the first to pave the way for many towards this modern trend.\n\nFor the past three hundred years, teachers and students of the keyboard have used the Anna Magdalena Notebook as a trustworthy source of pieces suited to beginner and elementary level players. Existing in two books dating 1722 and 1725 respectively, Notenbüchlein für Anna Magdalena Bach consisted of minuets, polonaises, marches, and the famous Aria of the Goldberg Variations. It was given to her as a gift by her husband Johann Sebastian Bach (OBM). Early drafts of his five distinguished and elegant French suites first appeared in this notebook as well as several vocal pieces and compositions by eminent contemporary composers. Chiefly known as Johann Sebastian Bach’s second wife, Anna Magdalena has been a subject of five German books in recent years. She was also the star of a fictitious diary written by an English author Esther Meynell (OBM) in 1925. The Anna Magdalena Notebook even inspired a Hong Kong movie titled Anna Magdalena in the late 90s.\n\nThe world famous Minuet in G from the Notebook formed the basis of a Cantonese pop song and, of course, the 1965 hit Lovers Concerto by the US pop girl group The Toys.\n\nLately, the name of Anna Magdalena Bach has been a hot topic and has made appearances in mainstream media since an Australian Professor Martin Jarvis (MGBH) argued that Anna Magdalena could have been the composer of the famous Cello Suites, and not Johann Sebastian Bach himself. But for most musicians, Anna Magdalena is habitually brushed aside as a complementary figure in the life of the great J.S. Bach and the dedicatee of the Notebooks. Apart from this, little is known about her, and it was, therefore, an appeal to embark on an investigative journey to discover more about her and, possibly, the status of female musicians in the 1700s. The investigation has not been so easy. Hard evidence, surviving letters, and documentation on Bach are comparatively scarce. The information about her available in English is even more limited. Despite these constraints, details of her life as a woman who was married to one of the greatest composers ever lived, could provide a window for modern readers to understand the domestic musical life of the Baroque era.\n\nAnna Magdalena was in fact a professional singer employed by the court prior to her marriage to J. S. Bach. This was a higher category of employment compared to most musicians of the time and was most definitely awarded due to a high level of musical ability.\n\nAnna Magdalena Bach, née Wilcke, was born into a musical family in 1701. Based in Weissenfels- the Saxony-Anhalt region of Germany, her father was a court trumpeter and her mother – a daughter of an organist. The details of the meeting between J. S. Bach and Anna Magdalena are unknown and much of what is known about her is focused on her post marriage life. Anna Magdalena was in fact a professional singer employed by the court prior to her marriage to J. S. Bach. Documentary evidence shows us that she had the official position of a chamber musician which she held for 2 years. This was a higher category of employment compared to most musicians of the time and was most definitely awarded due to a high level of musical ability.\n\nAt age 20, Anna Magdalena married J.S. Bach, who was 16 years her senior. The ceremony took place at their home by command of the Prince in 1721. As a young wife, she immediately assumed the role of a stepmother of four children and was possibly responsible for their musical education when Bach was unavailable. J.S. Bach’s first wife Maria Barbara (OBM) passed away suddenly in 1720 while Bach was away. One of the children from that marriage was his most famous son Carl Philip Emanuel Bach (OBM), who was still young at the time of his mother’s death. Anna Magdalena soon became a mother herself. Alongside being a mother, a stepmother, and a co-leader of a busy musical household, she was listed as a godparent of J.C. Hahn (OBM), a son of a footman to the Prince. The Bachs were not known to have written any diaries and, therefore, documentation on their domestic life is, unfortunately, scarce. Yet, there is a precious letter, in which Bach describes his domestic situation and family musical ensemble to his friend Georg Erdmann (OBM), the Imperial Russian residence agent in Danzig, which provides a rare glimpse of life inside the Bach household.\n\nUpon examining the obituary on Johann Sebastian written by his second eldest son, Carl wrote extensively on his birth mother Maria Barbara. Apart from a brief paragraph, Anna Magdalena was only referred to as a “widow [who] is also still living” on the list of surviving Bach family members.\n\nWhen she entered the Bach household, she gave birth almost every year for 13 years. Seven of her offsprings did not survive, but her surviving children included the celebrated son of Bach, Johann Christian (OBM), who was described as “the apple of Sebastian’s eye and his favorite pupil.”\n\nLife must have been difficult for Anna Magdalena. When she entered the Bach household, she gave birth almost every year for 13 years. Seven of her offsprings did not survive, but her surviving children included the celebrated son of Bach, Johann Christian (OBM), who was described as “the apple of Sebastian’s eye and his favorite pupil.” Moreover, the Bach house was a musical hub in Leipzig at the time, and many guests frequented the house. Not only did the lady of the house prepare to take care of her guests’ wellbeing during their visits, she also organized numerous musical evenings for the family and visitors.\n\nBach’s eldest son Carl described the Leipzig household as a “pigeonry.” For a period of time, Johann Elias Bach (OBM), son of Johann Sebastian’s first cousin took up the position as the master’s secretary, where he was in charge of correspondences, administrative work, and other tasks. It is evident that he was fond of Anna Magdalena. In August 1741, when Johann Sebastian was away, he wrote a letter to Bach on behalf of the household regarding his wife’s illness and referred to her as “our most lovable mama” (4). On another occasion, Johann Elias wrote a letter on behalf of Bach to obtain carnation flowers and a singing bird for his aunt “to brighten up her hard life” (5). It is through Johann Elias’s account that we learn of Anna Magdalena being ‘a great connoisseur of gardening” who very much appreciated life’s simple pleasures.\n\nUpon receiving the flowers, it was noted that “she values this unmerited gift more highly than children do their Christmas presents and tends them with such care as is usually given to children” (6). Heinz Gärtner (MGBH), the biographer of the musically talented Johann Christian, noted that ‘”Christian’s temperament and Anna Magdalena’s likable personality are clearly evident.” He describes Johann Christian’s manner as cheerful and ingenuous, “pure and naive” in contrast to the calculating, shrewd business sense of his brother Carl. As one of the oldest sons, Carl left home early to pursue his career in Berlin, so he was no longer financially dependent on the Bachs. However, Anna Magdalena and Johann Sebastian’s eldest son Gottfried Heinrich (OBM) caused the couple many troubled days. Despite showing promise in music, he was described as “feeble minded,” and was not able to attend normal schooling like his other male siblings. He was mentally handicapped and “did not fully develop” requiring Anna Magdalena’s constant attention.\n\nUpon receiving the flowers, it was noted that “she values this unmerited gift more highly than children do their Christmas presents and tends them with such care as is usually given to children”\n\nAs noted earlier, Anna Magdalena pursued a career as a professional singer in the Cöthen Court Chapel between 1721 and 1723. There had been remarks stating that she ceased her professional engagements after her marriage. However, surviving accounts authenticate her performances alongside her husband during birthday celebrations of Princess Charlotte (OBM) and the funeral procession of Prince Leopold (OBM). In J.S. Bach’s letter to Georg Erdmann (OBM), he refers to Anna Magdalena as his “present wife [who] sings a good, clear soprano.” As a part of a husband and wife team, she helped garner almost half of the annual household income, earning 200 thalers at first, which was then increased to 300 thalers subsequently, granted by the Prince. Her role in Johann Sebastian’s life also involved being his copyist, in which she prepared fair copies of the cello suites, violin partitas and sonatas, organ trio sonatas, major sections of the Well-Tempered Clavier, and Kyrie and Gloria of the B minor Mass, several cantatas, vocal and instrumental works. Yo Tomita (MGBH), the eminent Bach scholar, noted that her copies are “often the most important primary sources when Bach’s autographs do not survive.” Other notable scholars such as Paul Badura-Skoda (MGBH) remarked that the handwriting of husband and wife are extremely similar, and Tomita observed that their handwriting intertwined “in such a manner that they must surely have discussed something about the copies they were making together.”\n\nAs a part of a husband and wife team, she helped garner almost half of the annual household income, earning 200 thalers at first, which was then increased to 300 thalers subsequently, granted by the Prince.\n\nIndeed for the untrained eye, it is a challenge to distinguish the differences in manuscript writing between the husband and wife. As a loving husband, Johann Elias remarked that his cousin constantly looked out for gifts for Anna Magdalena and he even had her painted by court painter Antonio Cristofori (OBM). Unfortunately the painting has been lost, but this is testament that this practice was rather unusual for a woman of her social standing.\n\nAfter Johann Sebastian died in 1750, Anna Magdalena outlived him for 10 more years and passed away at the age of 59. Due to the size of the family, J.S. Bach’s possessions were divided between his nine surviving children and Anna Magdalena. Her financial state very quickly took a downward turn as we read petitions of hers as a “most sad estate of a widow.” She wrote to the council appealing for a death benefit and on two occasions fought for the guardianship of her own children, promising never to marry again. At this juncture, she was left with two sons and two daughters aged 9-18. There is an absence of documentation of her life after this period, except that she was left in a desolate state and was only offered a funeral as an “almosenfrau” – an impoverished woman. On her funeral notice posted in Leipzig in 1760, the figure ¼ was written in the margin, indicating a funeral of the simplest category with only a quarter of students singing in comparison to a funeral of normal practice at the time. It is puzzling, indeed, to learn that none of her surviving children were able to provide for her in her final years, but as the author Heinz Gärtner noted, this was, perhaps, a reflection of the general status of women at the time.\n\nOn her funeral notice posted in Leipzig in 1760, the figure ¼ was written in the margin, indicating a funeral of the simplest category with only a quarter of students singing in comparison to a funeral of normal practice at the time.\n\nAnna Magdalena Bach juggled multiple important roles during her lifetime. Professionally, she was a talented singer, assistant, copyist, and public performance partner alongside her husband. Domestically, she was his companion, mother, wife, manager of a busy household and occasional performer on musical evenings. Her manuscript copies are some of the most important sources of Bach’s music when autographs are missing, and it is difficult to imagine the state of Bach research without her pertinent contributions.\n\nAlthough it may never be possible to prove whether she did in fact compose any music, Anna Magdalena’s life, nevertheless, provides a lens for modern day researchers to examine the state of professional female musicians and the status of women musicians in the late Baroque period.\n\nReferences:\n\n(1) Bach, Johann Sebastian, and Vivian Langrish.

In his view, achievement and success were the result of effort and perseverance. But most people see it differently. The majority – even 75% of music educators – subscribe to a theory that superior achievement in music is part of a genetic endowment. Most will put that it must also include hard work, opportunities, parental encouragement and so forth, but ultimately, one must have the X factor, the natural, unbidden genetic talent, to really achieve. Logically, knowledge and ability can only derive from genetic endowment or living experience, so it must be one or the other, or the combination theory. The problem with gene theory is that researchers are yet to find gene systems among the 25 000 or so genes with which we are born that result in special musical ability. If musical talent or any other talent is innate then there must be a gene for it. Where is the evidence of genes for complex and multi-faceted behaviours? This is the challenge for talent theorists. Talent genes may well be discovered in the future but if they do not exist, then where does musicality emanate? Can something come from nothing? Is talent a gift from G-d? Homer (OBM) seemed to think so. From the Ancient World through the Renaissance, artistic skill was viewed as an intuitive gift rather than the result of effort. To this day, musical ability is more often considered innately derived than any other ability or human faculty. This is the elephant in the music education classroom. Ignorance is not a point of view. We must get to the truth of this because of the seismic impact of the implications. According to talent theory, some lucky individuals win the genetic lottery. They are born with musical talent and fortunate circumstances allow them to find opportunities to nurture this gift early in their lives. So-called evidence for this is anecdotal and stories of exceptional prodigies abound. How, for example, could Mozart’s (OBM) precocity be explained in any other way?\n\nTo this day, musical ability is more often considered innately derived than any other ability or human faculty. This is the elephant in the music education classroom.\n\nActually, Mozart’s musical feats can be explained rationally. The biographies of all great composers reveal substantial and sustained early training, supported by family and tutors. Mozart was no different. It is difficult to separate fact from fiction 230 years after the event, but several factors do help account for his accomplishments. Mozart was immersed in a concentrated musical environment from his earliest days. His father, Leopold (OBM), was an excellent music educator and took every opportunity to earnestly promote his son’s musical ability. Stories such as that of two-year-old Wolfgang identifying the sound of pig squeals as G-sharp should be taken with a grain of salt, as they were most likely spawned by his father, who was not always honest in relation to his son where music was concerned. As Camille Saint-Saens (OBM) says, “History is made up of what probably happened; mythology of what probably did not happen. There are myths in history and history in myths .” Leopold was known to subtract a year from the ages of his children, Wolfgang and Nannerl, when advertising their performances. Leopold was a smart operator. He knew that lowering his children’s ages would augment their appeal and perhaps enhance his own reputation as a teacher; it is not unusual for parents to embellish facts to help their children get ahead. A closer inspection of Mozart’s childhood compositions indicates assistance from his father as well as thematic material borrowed from other composers, notably Johann Christian Bach (OBM), with whom Mozart collaborated in London at the age of nine. If we accept that these are normal processes that lead to achievement, even extraordinary achievement, then none of this is an issue. Imitation is a natural part of the learning process, and lying about a child’s age does not detract from the skills exhibited. However, it does skew the picture. The possibility that Mozart’s great desire to make music was rooted in pre-birth fortune cannot be ruled out, but his early musical environment was encouraging and inspiring. Having a great passion for music—and a supportive even if overbearing, micro-managing and opportunistic father—led him to take advantage of his opportunities and to practice for several hours a day from the age of two. Estimates have Mozart reaching an accumulated practice figure of 10, 000 hours by the age of eight.\n\nEven if you take the position that a child is born with genetic potential, this potential can only become skill and ability through work. As John Maxwell (MGBH) implies in the title of his book Talent Is Never Enough, major achievement requires preparation and persistence on top of any natural potential. This is most true as we progress in our skills. The assumed natural talent that differentiates children becomes less evident as they age, as dedication and sheer hard work play greater roles in achievement. Malcolm Gladwell says, “The further a career develops, the less important the role of assumed innate ability in comparison with preparation or practice”. Quality and quantity of practice develop expertise.\n\nShe plays so well because she has talent. How do I know she has talent? That’s obvious, she plays so well!\n\nIn every case, identifying talent is retrospective, and the emergence of prodigious skill follows rather than precedes unique opportunity and substantial work. In the investigation of superior achievement, precocity is the result of early childhood experiences, parental support, a young starting age, training, practice hours, habits, metacognitive skills, and opportunity. What distinguishes prodigies is the fact that they are constantly compared with children their own age, rather than with others who have accrued similar quantities of practice hours, similar opportunities, and family support. Take Tiffany Poon (MGBH) for example. Born in Hong Kong in 1997, this girl has experienced a meteoric rise as a concert pianist and has been lauded far and wide for her giftedness and substantial accomplishments. No doubt it is rare to find a child her age who has achieved so much and who plays the piano so well. At the age of eight, Tiffany accepted the opportunity of a scholarship at The Juilliard School in New York City, and flourished. As is usually the case with young achievers, testimonials on her website make age comparisons.\n\n“Tiffany Poon possessed skills of a kind that I had never observed in such a young musician. She displays a sense of musical maturity that goes well beyond her current age.” – Gary McPherson (MGBH), Ormond Chair of Music, Head of the School of Music, University of Melbourne.\n\n“Tiffany Poon plays with technical skills well beyond her years.” – the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nTiffany’s biography states that she started playing on a toy piano at the age of two and when she began formal lessons at age four-and-a-half she practiced four hours a day for the next two years. If we assume Tiffany had a rest day and practiced six days per week, this totals 1,248 hours of practice. This is substantial for one so young and is many times the practice hours of other children of that age. Assuming that fifteen minutes is about the average daily practice time for this age group, we have a 1,600 percent differential in practice time. Professor John Sloboda (MGBH) says, “There is no evidence of a fast track for high achievers,” which suggests that in terms of time expenditure, the pathway to progress is basically the same for everyone. To achieve you must put in the hours and do the work. In one study Sloboda found that predominantly it takes individuals about 1,200 practice hours to reach a formal music examination level of Grade Five, and 3,300 practice hours to reach Grade Eight. Accumulation of practice hours is not the only factor in musical achievement, but it is the predominant one.\n\nWe owe it to Tiffany to give her the credit for having achieved excellence. As an infant she had an intense curiosity for music and quickly developed the ability to concentrate for long periods of time. Note also that the testimonial from the Columbus Dispatch refers to “technical” skills. Fields such as music, chess, and mathematics are suited to young achievement because the precocity is almost always derived from algorithmic study. In later life real musicianship requires much more than technical prowess. Adult musicians with technical skills alone are not special. Tiffany’s parental support also has significantly influenced her achievement. Not only did the family relocate from Hong Kong for the express purpose of gaining a better music education for Tiffany, but Tiffany’s parents also instilled in her the critical learning strategies we call deliberate practice. From the earliest stages of Tiffany’s musical development her mother challenged her to play through passages several times correctly in succession. This game taught Tiffany the power of repetition. Contrast this with how most children practice music. One study found that more than 90 percent of children’s practice time was spent playing pieces from beginning to end only once and without stopping to correct any errors. In their coaching, Tiffany’s parents showed great astuteness, especially considering neither of them had any formal musical training.\n\nFields such as music, chess, and mathematics are suited to young achievement because the precocity is almost always derived from algorithmic study.

Dweck’s research, as documented in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success presents a strong case that a focus on genetic gift can lead to a poor work ethic. Children with this fixed-intelligence mindset get the impression that they do not need to work as hard as “average” children do. Natural ability should not need to make an effort. People labelled as ‘naturally talented’ or ‘gifted’ can be ruthlessly protective of their labels and therefore avoid challenges or risks that might lead to their making mistakes. This desire to look smart and prove their intelligence, at the expense of improving it, must be preserved at all costs. This mindset is more likely to hide rather than correct mistakes, and following a setback, is less persistent when compared with growth-mindset individuals. Hence the typical combination – gifted and lazy. On the other hand, people who believe their intelligence is a potential to be developed through effort are less worried about short-term mistakes, difficulties, and failures. They view these events as an essential part of the learning process. People with this growth-intelligence mindset tend to reach higher levels of achievement and enjoy the learning challenges inherent in the process. The advantage of the growth-mindset is not just about learning how to succeed but about learning how to persevere when one does not succeed.\n\nDweck’s research, as documented in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success presents a strong case that a focus on genetic gift can lead to a poor work ethic.

People with this growth-intelligence mindset tend to reach higher levels of achievement and enjoy the learning challenges inherent in the process.\n\nTo prove or improve my intelligence; that is the mindset question!\n\nResearch into the effects of mindset on achievement is of particular interest to music educators. Susan O’Neill (MGBH) found noticeable differences in the practice efficiency among children exhibiting different mindset. For one, fixed-intelligence-mindset children practiced roughly twice as much as growth-intelligence-mindset children to reach the same level of moderate performance achievement. Fixed-intelligence-mindset students use their time less efficiently. They are more likely to avoid practicing pieces or passages that pose particular difficulties. These children probably spend more time on what they already can play well, which might be enjoyable but will hardly improve performance. Growth-intelligence-mindset children are more likely to embrace the challenges that lead to mastery. It is not easy to teach learning strategies to fixed-intelligence-mindset students who have deep-set beliefs about their potential. Unless this mindset is reformed, they emerge as adults with stifling doubts about their capacity to learn. In his book Effortless Mastery, Kenny Werner (MBGH0 refers to “the menacing voices from childhood” – the struggle to learn is very often a result of being told that the task is really difficult, or you have not the talent for it. The word difficult can be discouraging. I like Werner’s suggestion to explain task complexity in terms of “unfamiliar” and “familiar” rather than “difficult” and “easy.” By attributing failure to lack of effort or poor practice strategies, rather than natural ability, teachers and parents can help transform mindset.\n\nThe word difficult can be discouraging.
