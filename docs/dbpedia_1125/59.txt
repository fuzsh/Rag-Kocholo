Submerged 200 feet within the depths of a former limestone quarry, Dalhalla serves as a concert venue unlike any other. Offering a diverse calendar of events, the venue has hosted acts like Kraftwerk, various orchestras, operas and also a music festival called Into The Valley that has previously featured a line-up consisting of Nina Kraviz, Jeff Mills, Ben Klock and Dixon among others. Located in central Sweden, Dalhalla rests near lake Siljan in the town of Rattvik, isolated by rich forests. Due to it’s unique location, it is said to possess some of the best sound quality in all of Europe

Among the more than 150 caves located inside the Rock of Gibraltar rests St. Michael's Cave, a massive opening created by water dripping through the limestone formation. As the largest section of the cave, Cathedral Cave offers ideal acoustics and the chamber often hosts concerts and plays, mostly featuring classical music, but rock and pop groups have been known to perform there as well. Although you won’t find dance music’s leading players sharing their sounds, a music festival called the Gibraltar World Music Festival takes place there and focuses on a different theme each year.
