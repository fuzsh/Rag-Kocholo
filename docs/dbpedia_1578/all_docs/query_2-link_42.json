        "text": "Eye-mouth-eye angle as a good indicator of face masculinization, asymmetry, and attractiveness (Homo sapiens).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDanel, Dariusz; Pawlowski, Boguslaw\n\n2007-05-01\n\nPast research on male facial attractiveness has been limited by the reliance on facialmetric measures that are less than ideal. In particular, some of these measures are face size dependent and show only weak sexual dimorphism, which limits the ability to identify the relationship between masculinization and attractiveness. Here, the authors show that eye-mouth-eye (EME) angle is a quantitative and face size independent trait that is sexually dimorphic and a good indicator of masculinity and face symmetry. Using frontal photographs of female and male faces, the authors first confirmed that the EME angle (measured with the vertex in the middle of the mouth and the arms crossing the centers of pupils) was highly sexually dimorphic. Then, using pictures of young male faces whose attractiveness was assessed on a 7-point scale by young women, the authors showed that attractiveness rate was negatively correlated with EME angle and with the angle asymmetry. The results are compared with those that could be obtained with interpupilary or upper face height measurements. The authors discuss the relationship between attractiveness and both EME angle and its symmetry in the light of evolutionary psychology.\n\nAcquisition of Lateralized Predation Behavior Associated with Development of Mouth Asymmetry in a Lake Tanganyika Scale-Eating Cichlid Fish.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYuichi Takeuchi\n\nFull Text Available The scale-eating cichlid Perissodus microlepis with asymmetric mouth is an attractive model of behavioral laterality: each adult tears off scales from prey fishes' left or right flanks according to the direction in which its mouth is skewed. To investigate the development of behavioral laterality and mouth asymmetry, we analyzed stomach contents and lower jaw-bone asymmetry of various-sized P. microlepis (22 â¤ SL<115 mm sampled in Lake Tanganyika. The shapes of the pored scales found in each specimen's stomach indicated its attack side preference. Early-juvenile specimens (SL<45 mm feeding mainly on zooplankton exhibited slight but significant mouth asymmetry. As the fish acquired scale-eating (45 mm â¤ SL, attack side preference was gradually strengthened, as was mouth asymmetry. Among size-matched individuals, those with more skewed mouths ate more scales. These findings show that behavioral laterality in scale-eating P. microlepis is established in association with development of mouth asymmetry which precedes the behavioral acquisition, and that this synergistic interaction between physical and behavioral literalities may contribute to efficient scale-eating.\n\nInfluence of Cobb Angle and ISIS2 Surface Topography Volumetric Asymmetry on Scoliosis Research Society-22 Outcome Scores in Scoliosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrewer, Paul; Berryman, Fiona; Baker, De; Pynsent, Paul; Gardner, Adrian\n\n2013-11-01\n\nRetrospective sequential patient series. To establish the relationship between the magnitude of the deformity in scoliosis and patients' perception of their condition, as measured with Scoliosis Research Society-22 scores. A total of 93 untreated patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were included retrospectively. The Cobb angle was measured from a plain radiograph, and volumetric asymmetry was measured by ISIS2 surface topography. The association between Scoliosis Research Society scores for function, pain, self-image, and mental health against Cobb angle and volumetric asymmetry was investigated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Correlation of both Cobb angle and volumetric asymmetry with function and pain was weak (all self-image, was higher, although still moderate (-.37 for Cobb angle and -.44 for volumetric asymmetry). Both were statistically significant (Cobb angle, p = .0002; volumetric asymmetry; p = .00001). Cobb angle contributed 13.8% to the linear relationship with self-image, whereas volumetric asymmetry contributed 19.3%. For mental health, correlation was statistically significant with Cobb angle (p = .011) and volumetric asymmetry (pÂ =Â .0005), but the correlation was low to moderate (-.26 and -.35, respectively). Cobb angle contributed 6.9% to the linear relationship with mental health, whereas volumetric asymmetry contributed 12.4%. Volumetric asymmetry correlates better with both mental health and self-image compared with Cobb angle, but the correlation was only moderate. This study suggests that a patient's own perception of self-image and mental health is multifactorial and not completely explained through present objective measurements of the size of the deformity. This helps to explain the difficulties in any objective analysis of a problem with multifactorial perception issues. Further study is required to investigate other physical aspects of the deformity that may have a role in how patients view themselves.

Visual field results of 117 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive glaucoma patients (42 NTG, 38 POAG, and 37 CACG) were studied retrospectively. The following 3 visual field defect parameters were used to evaluate the interocular asymmetry: (1) global indices; (2) local mean deviations (MDs) of 6 predefined visual field areas; and (3) stage designated by glaucoma staging system 2. The differences of the above parameters between the trial eye (the eye with greater MDs) and the fellow eye in each subject were defined as interocular asymmetry scores. Interocular asymmetry of visual field loss was presented in all the 3 groups (all P0.05). Interocular asymmetry scores of glaucoma staging system 2 had no significant difference among the 3 groups (P=0.068). All CACG, POAG, and NTG groups presented with interocular asymmetric visual field loss at the time of diagnosis. CACG had greater interocular asymmetry compared with NTG and POAG. No significant interocular asymmetry difference was observed between NTG and POAG.\n\nBeam Normal Single Spin Asymmetry in Forward Angle Inelastic Electron-Proton Scattering using the Q-Weak Apparatus\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\n., Nuruzzaman [Hampton Univ., Hampton, VA (United States)\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Q-weak experiment in Hall-C at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has made the first direct measurement of the weak charge of the proton through the precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in elastic electron-proton scattering at low momentum transfer. There is also a parity conserving Beam Normal Single Spin Asymmetry or transverse asymmetry (B_n) on H_2 with a sin(phi)-like dependence due to two-photon exchange. If the size of elastic B_n is a few ppm, then a few percent residual transverse polarization in the beam, combined with small broken azimuthal symmetries in the detector, would require a few ppb correction to the Q-weak data. As part of a program of B_n background studies, we made the first measurement of B_n in the N-to-Delta(1232) transition using the Q-weak apparatus. The final transverse asymmetry, corrected for backgrounds and beam polarization, was found to be B_n = 42.82 Â± 2.45 (stat) Â± 16.07 (sys) ppm at beam energy E_beam = 1.155 GeV, scattering angle theta = 8.3 deg, and missing mass W = 1.2 GeV. B_n from electron-nucleon scattering is a unique tool to study the gamma^* Delta Delta form factors, and this measurement will help to improve the theoretical models on beam normal single spin asymmetry and thereby our understanding of the doubly virtual Compton scattering process. To help correct false asymmetries from beam noise, a beam modulation system was implemented to induce small position, angle, and energy changes at the target to characterize detector response to the beam jitter. Two air-core dipoles separated by ~10 m were pulsed at a time to produce position and angle changes at the target, for virtually any tune of the beamline. The beam energy was modulated using an SRF cavity. The hardware and associated control instrumentation will be described in this dissertation. Preliminary detector sensitivities were extracted which helped to reduce the width of the measured asymmetry. The beam modulation system\n\nLeft-right asymmetry in neutrino-produced hadron jets\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBallagh, H.C.; Bingham, H.H.; Lawry, T.J.; Lys, J.; Lynch, G.R.; Sokoloff, M.D.; Stevenson, M.L.; Huson, F.R.; Schmidt, E.; Smart, W.; Treadwell, E.; Cence, R.J.; Harris, F.A.; Jones, M.D.; Koide, A.; Peters, M.W.; Peterson, V.Z.; Lubatti, H.J.; Moriyasu, K.; Wolin, E.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIn an experiment (E546) to study interactions of left-angle E right-angle=100 GeV and left-angle Q 2 right-angle=17 GeV 2 neutrinos in the Fermilab 15-foot bubble chamber, we have looked for a left-right asymmetry in the azimuthal angle Ï of individual hadrons about the direction of the lepton momentum transfer (q vector). Significant asymmetry is found for forward positive hadrons; for x F >0.10, we find left-angle cosÏ right-angle=-0.029Â±0.008, where x F is the Feynman x variable. Negative hadrons with x F >0.10 show no asymmetry, left-angle cosÏ right-angle=0.004Â±0.011. A model which includes parton intrinsic transverse momentum k t reproduces the asymmetry of combined positive and negative hadrons with x F >0.10, left-angle cosÏ right-angle=-0.018Â±0.0065, if left-angle k t 2 right-angle=0.065Â±0.024 GeV 2 /c 2 . But the model predicts almost equal asymmetries for positive and negative hadrons. The model also agrees poorly with the observed dependence on the kinematic variables x and Q 2 if the k t distribution is assumed to be independent of kinematic variables\n\nInformation asymmetry, social networking site word of mouth, and mobility effects on social commerce in Korea.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHwang, In Jeong; Lee, Bong Gyou; Kim, Ki Youn\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this research is to examine the issues that affect customers' behavioral character and purchasing behavior. The study proposes a research hypothesis with independent variables that include social presence, trust, and information asymmetry, and the dependent variable purchase decision making, to explain differentiated customer decision making processes in social commerce (S-commerce). To prove the hypothesis, positive verification was performed by focusing on mediating effects through a customer uncertainty variable and moderating effects through mobility and social networking site word of mouth (SNS WOM) variables. The number of studies on customer trends has rapidly increased together with the market size of S-commerce. However, few studies have examined the negative variables that make customers hesitant to make decisions in S-commerce. This study investigates the causes of customer uncertainty and focuses on deducing the control variables that offset this negative relationship. The study finds that in customers' S-commerce purchasing actions, the SNS WOM and mobility variables show control effects between information asymmetry and uncertainty and between trust and uncertainty. Additionally, this research defines the variables related to customer uncertainty that are hidden in S-commerce, and statistically verifies their relationship. The research results can be used in Internet marketing practices to establish marketing mix strategies for customer demand or as research data to predict customer behavior. The results are scientifically meaningful as a precedent for research on customers in S-commerce.\n\nThe small mixing angle $\\\\theta_{13}$ and the lepton asymmetry\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLee, S H; Lee, Song-Haeng; Siyeon, Kim\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe present the correlation of low energy CP phases, both Dirac and Majorana, and the lepton asymmetry for the baryon asymmetry in the universe, with a certain class of Yukawa matrices that consist of two right-handed neutrinos and include one texture zero in themselves. For cases in which the amount of the lepton asymmetry $Y_L$ turns out to be proportional to $\\\\theta_{13}^2$, we consider the relation between two types of CP phases and the relation of $Y_L$ versus the Jarlskog invariant or the amplitude of neutrinoless double beta decay as $\\\\theta_{13}$ varies.\n\nMeasurement of the effective weak mixing angle by jet-charge asymmetry in hadronic decays of the Z boson\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAcciarri, M;

[College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA (United States)\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThe goal of Experiment E04-115 (the G0 backward angle measurement) at Jefferson Lab is to investigate the contributions of strange quarks to the fundamental properties of the nucleon. The experiment measures parity-violating asymmetries in elastic electron scattering off hydrogen and quasielastic electron scattering off deuterium at backward angles at Q2 = 0.631 (GeV/c)2 and Q2 = 0.232 (GeV/c)2. The backward angle measurement represents the second phase of the G0 experiment. The first phase, Experiment E00-006 (the G0 forward angle experiment), measured parity-violating asymmetries in elastic electron scattering off hydrogen at forward angles over a Q2 range of 0.1-1.0 (GeV/c)2. The experiments used a polarized electron beam and unpolarized hydrogen and deuterium liquid targets. From these measurements, along with the electromagnetic form factors, one can extract the contribution of the strange quark to the proton's charge and magnetization distributions.

When only one unpolarized hadron is selected, it exhibits an azimuthal modulation known as Collins effect. When a pair of oppositely charged hadrons is observed, three asymmetries can be considered, a di-hadron asymmetry and two single hadron asymmetries. In lepton deep inelastic scattering on transversely polarized nucleons all these asymmetries are coupled with the transversity distribution. From the high statistics COMPASS data on oppositely charged hadron-pair production we have investigated for the first time the dependence of these three asymmetries on the difference of the azimuthal angles of the two hadrons. The similarity of transversity induced single and di-hadron asymmetries is discussed.

Adolph\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available In the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark several leftâright asymmetries are possible for the hadrons in the jet. When only one unpolarized hadron is selected, it exhibits an azimuthal modulation known as the Collins effect. When a pair of oppositely charged hadrons is observed, three asymmetries can be considered, a di-hadron asymmetry and two single hadron asymmetries. In lepton deep inelastic scattering on transversely polarized nucleons all these asymmetries are coupled with the transversity distribution. From the high statistics COMPASS data on oppositely charged hadron-pair production we have investigated for the first time the dependence of these three asymmetries on the difference of the azimuthal angles of the two hadrons. The similarity of transversity induced single and di-hadron asymmetries is discussed. A new analysis of the data allows quantitative relationships to be established among them, providing for the first time strong experimental indication that the underlying fragmentation mechanisms are all driven by a common physical process.\n\nDifferential Cross Section and Photon-Beam Asymmetry for the Î³ â p â Ï-Î++(1232 ) Reaction at Forward Ï- Angles for EÎ³=1.5 -2.95 GeV\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKohri, H.; Shiu, S.

Y.; Yosoi, M.; LEPS Collaboration\n\n2018-05-01\n\nDifferential cross sections and photon-beam asymmetries for the Î³ â p âÏ-Î++(1232 ) reaction have been measured for 0.7 production mechanisms of a pure u u Â¯ quark pair in the final state from the proton. Although there is no distinct peak structure in the cross sections, a non-negligible excess over the theoretical predictions is observed at EÎ³=1.5 - 1.8 GeV . The asymmetries are found to be negative in most of the present kinematical regions, suggesting the dominance of Ï exchange in the t channel. The negative asymmetries at forward meson production angles are different from the asymmetries previously measured for the photoproduction reactions producing a d d Â¯ or an s s Â¯ quark pair in the final state. Advanced theoretical models introducing nucleon resonances and additional unnatural-parity exchanges are needed to reproduce the present data.\n\nMeasurement of the weak mixing angle with the forward-backward asymmetry of Drell-Yan events at 8 TeV\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nCMS Collaboration\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe present a measurement of the effective weak mixing angle using the forward-backward asymmetry of Drell-Yan ($ee$ and $\\\\mu\\\\mu$) events in pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}=8~\\\\mathrm{TeV}$ at CMS. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $18.8~\\\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and $19.6~\\\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for muon and electron channels, respectively. The sample consists of 8.2 million dimuon and 4.9 million dielectron events. With new analysis techniques and a larger dataset, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced compared to our previous measurement. The extracted value of the effective weak mixing angle from the combined $ee$ and $\\\\mu\\\\mu$ data samples is $ \\\\sin^2\\\\theta^{\\\\text{lept}}_{\\\\text{eff}}=0.23101\\\\pm 0.00036(\\\\text{stat})\\\\pm 0.00018(\\\\text{syst})\\\\pm 0.00016(\\\\text{theory})\\\\pm 0.00030(\\\\text{pdf})$ or $ \\\\sin^2\\\\theta^{\\\\text{lept}}_{\\\\text{eff}}=0.23101\\\\pm0.00052$.\n\nTheoretical morphology and development of flight feather vane asymmetry with experimental tests in parrots.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFeo, Teresa J; Prum, Richard O\n\n2014-06-01\n\nAsymmetry in flight feather vane width is a major functional innovation associated with the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds. However, the developmental and morphological basis of feather shape is not simple, and the developmental processes involved in vane width asymmetry are poorly understood. We present a theoretical model of feather morphology and development that describes the possible ways to modify feather development and produce vane asymmetry. Our model finds that the theoretical morphospace of feather shape is redundant, and that many different combinations of parameters could be responsible for vane asymmetry in a given feather. Next, we empirically measured morphological and developmental model parameters in asymmetric and symmetric feathers from two species of parrots to identify which combinations of parameters create vane asymmetry in real feathers. We found that both longer barbs, and larger barb angles in the relatively wider trailing vane drove asymmetry in tail feathers. Developmentally, longer barbs were the result of an offset of the radial position of the new barb locus, whereas larger barb angles were produced by differential expansion of barbs as the feather unfurls from the tubular feather germ. In contrast, the helical angle of barb ridge development did not contribute to vane asymmetry and could be indicative of a constraint. This research provides the first comprehensive description of both the morphological and developmental modifications responsible for vane asymmetry within real feathers, and identifies key steps that must have occurred during the evolution of vane asymmetry.

The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 18.8 and 19.6 fb$^{-1}$ in the dimuon and dielectron channels, respectively, containing 8.2 million dimuon and 4.9 million dielectron events. With more events and new analysis techniques, including constraints obtained on the parton distribution functions from the measured forward-backward asymmetry, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced relative to previous CMS measurements. The extracted value of ${\\\\sin^2\\\\theta^{\\\\ell}_{\\\\text{eff}}} $ from the combined dilepton data is ${\\\\sin^2\\\\theta^{\\\\ell}_{\\\\text{eff}}} = $ 0.23101 $\\\\pm$ 0.00036 (stat) $\\\\pm$ 0.00018 (syst) $\\\\pm$ 0.00016 (theo) $\\\\pm$ 0.00031 (parton distributions in proton) $ = $ 0.23101 $\\\\pm$ 0....\n\nRadiative corrections to the beam spin asymmetry in photon electroproduction e polarized p {yields} ep{gamma}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFonvieille, H.; Bensafa, I. [LPC-Clermont-Fd, Universite Blaise Pascal, F-63170 Aubiere Cedex (France)\n\n2006-11-15\n\nWe have measured at MAMI the beam single spin asymmetry (SSA) in exclusive photon electroproduction (e polarized p {yields} ep{gamma}) with a longitudinally polarized beam, in the region of the {delta}(1232) resonance. In this document the value of the radiative correction to this asymmetry is obtained for our kinematics. Although the correction is expected to be very small and negligible, its value is needed as a confirmation and for the purpose of systematic error estimate.

To estimate this error a 100 % variation of the radiative correction was assumed. For the radiative correction itself the maximal value found was taken.

This morphological laterality has a genetic basis and has therefore been used as a model for studying negative frequency-dependent selection and the resulting oscillation in frequencies of two genotypes, lefty and righty, in a population. This study aims were to confirm this laterality in Perissodus microlepis Boulenger and P. straeleni (Poll) and evaluate an appropriate method for measuring and testing the asymmetry. Left-right differences in the height of the mandible posterior ends (HMPE) and the angle between the neurocranium and vertebrae of P. microlepis and P. straeleni were measured on skeletal specimens. Snout-bending angle was also measured using a dorsal image of the same individuals following a previous method. To define which distribution model, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), directional asymmetry (DA), or antisymmetry (AS), best fit to the lateral asymmetry of the traits, we provided an R package, IASD. As a result, HMPE and neurocranium-vertebrae angle of both species were best fitted to AS, suggesting that P. microlepis and P. straeleni showed a distinct dimorphism in these traits, although snout-bending angle of P. microlepis was best fitted to FA. Measurement error was low for HMPE comparing the snout-bending angle in P. microlepis, indicating that measuring HMPE is a more accurate method. The scale-eating tribe Perissodini showed distinct antisymmetry in the jaw skeleton and neurocranium-vertebrae angle, and this laterality remains a valid marker for further evolutionary studies.\n\nPoloidal asymmetries in the scrape-off layer plasma of the Alcator C tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLaBombard, B.; Lipschultz, B.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nLarge poloidal asymmetries in density, electron temperature, radial density e-folding length and floating potential have been measured in the plasma existing between the limiter radius and the wall of the Alcator C tokamak. Typically, variations in density by factors of about 4-20 and variations in radial density e-folding length by factors of about 3-8 are recorded in discharges which are bounded by poloidally symmetric ring limiters. These poloidal asymmetries show that pressure is a function of poloidal angle on open magnetic flux surfaces in this region of the plasma. Observations of toroidally symmetric MARFE (multifaceted asymmetric radiation from the edge) phenomena further imply that density and perhaps pressure are also a function of poloidal angle on closed flux surfaces existing just inside the limiter radius. The magnitude of these poloidal asymmetries and their dependence on poloidal angle persists independent of machine parameters (central plasma density, plasma current, toroidal field, MARFE versus non-MARFE discharges). Analysis of the data indicates that these asymmetries are caused by poloidal variations in perpendicular particle and heat transport in both the main plasma and the scrape-off layer. A number of possible asymmetric perpendicular transport processes in the scrape-off layer plasma are examined, including diffusion and E-vectorxB-vector plasma convection.

Material and methods. Fifty-seven patients (first maturity level who had some teeth extracted for orthodontic treatment were included in the study. The patients were divided into basic and control groups. We proposed to shape the extraction socket immediately after the extraction of a permanent tooth. In the basic group the extraction sockets were filled with osteoplastic material. Patients in the control group refused any surgical interventions. Results. According to a given criterion, the correlation between tooth size and dental arch parameters has been determined. When applying this criterion for finding the correlation, the frontal distal diagonal size of the dental arch was multiplied by 1.14 coefficient. The sum of the mesiodistal diameters of seven teeth in the half-arc was subtracted from the obtained value. The value which was equal to 0Â±1.0mm indicated the correlation between tooth size and dental arch parameters. Conclusion. If there is a correlation between tooth size and dental arch parameters, it is advisable to provide treatment associated with having the post-extraction socket opened and implant therapy performed (most commonly with the use of intraosseous dental implants.\n\nInheritance patterns of morphological laterality in mouth opening of zebrafish, Danio rerio.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHata, Hiroki; Hori, Michio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe inheritance patterns of asymmetry in mouth opening in zebrafish were investigated using crossing experiments. Zebrafish exhibit asymmetric laterality in mouth opening, with each individual having either a leftward (righty) or rightward (lefty) bias. All righty incrosses produced only righty F(1), whereas all lefty incrosses resulted in an F(1) L:R ratio of 2:1. All test crosses between lefty and righty individuals resulted in an F(1) L:R=1:1. These results were consistent with the hereditary pattern for Japanese medaka, three Tanganyikan cichlids, and a Japanese riverine goby. The pattern suggests a one-locus two-allele Mendelian model of inheritance, with the lefty allele being dominant over righty and the dominant homozygote being lethal. To determine the reason for the absence of lefty homozygotes, the survival rates of the offspring were examined according to developmental stage. Survival did not differ among combinations of parent laterality. Thus the mechanism underlying the lethality of the dominant homozygote remains unclear. This study showed that the mouth-opening laterality of zebrafish is genetically determined and that the direction follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern that is shared among cypriniform zebrafish, beloniform medaka, perciform cichlids, and a goby, suggesting a common genetic background in mouth-opening laterality among these species.\n\nCleft lip with or without cleft palate and dermatoglyphic asymmetry: evaluation of a Chinese population.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNeiswanger, K; Cooper, M E; Weinberg, S M; Flodman, P; Keglovits, A Bundens; Liu, Y; Hu, D N; Melnick, M; Spence, M A; Marazita, M L\n\n2002-08-01\n\nTo determine if Chinese individuals with non syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) display more dermatoglyphic asymmetry than unaffected relatives or controls. Case-control study with two control groups (genetically related and unrelated). A total of 500 CL/P probands from Shanghai, China, 421 unaffected relatives, and 66 controls of Chinese heritage. Finger and palm prints were collected, and pattern frequencies, total ridge counts (TRC), and atd angles were calculated. Asymmetry scores between right and left hands were defined for each of the three dermatoglyphic measures. Probands' asymmetry scores were compared statistically with the scores of unaffected relatives and controls. In general, the probands' asymmetry scores for TRC and atd angle did not differ significantly from the scores of either unaffected relatives or controls. However, probands with a positive family history of clefting showed significantly more asymmetry in their pattern types than either probands without a family history, unaffected relatives or controls. These results suggest that a unique genetic mechanism of developmental instability may obtain in CL/P individuals with a positive family history of clefting.\n\nTrench mouth\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n... gingivae).

ArGo-GoMe (P=0.003 and (P<0.011 for 6-9 and 9-12 years age group, respectively, were significantly low in nasal breathers group. Conclusions: Changed mode of respiration was associated with increased facial height, mandibular plane angle and gonial angle.\n\nBurning Mouth Syndrome and \"Burning Mouth Syndrome\".\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRifkind, Jacob Bernard\n\n2016-03-01\n\nBurning mouth syndrome is distressing to both the patient and practitioner unable to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Burning mouth syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, which is used only after nutritional deficiencies, mucosal disease, fungal infections, hormonal disturbances and contact stomatitis have been ruled out. This article will explore the many causes and treatment of patients who present with a chief complaint of \"my mouth burns,\" including symptomatic treatment for those with burning mouth syndrome.\n\nTechnical errors in complete mouth radiographic survey according to radiographic techniques and film holding methods\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChoi, Karp Sik; Byun, Chong Soo; Choi, Soon Chul\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the numbers and causes of retakes in 300 complete mouth radiographic surveys made by 75 senior dental students. According to radiographic techniques and film holding methods, they were divided into 4 groups: Group I: Bisecting-angle technique with patient's fingers. Group II: Bisecting-angle technique with Rinn Snap-A-Ray device. Group III: Bisecting-angle technique with Rinn XCP instrument (short cone) Group IV: Bisecting-angle technique with Rinn XCP instrument (long cone). The most frequent cases of retakes, the most frequent tooth area examined, of retakes and average number of retakes per complete mouth survey were evaluated. The obtained results were as follows: Group I: Incorrect film placement (47.8), upper canine region, and 0.89. Group II: Incorrect film placement (44.0), upper canine region, and 1.12. Group III: Incorrect film placement (79.2), upper canine region, and 2.05.

The measurements are exercised on a beam of linearly polarized photons of a linear 2 GeV electron accelerator by means of two magnetic spectrometers in the Esub(Î³)=80-600 MeV energy range for 75-105 deg angles of proton escape in scm. The flowsheet of an experimental facility is presented. Technique of the experiment execution is presented. The obtained values of the cross section asymmetry parameter are presented in the table form for the 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150 deg angles. Calculation of the differential cross sections is carried out in pulse approximation. Energy Dependence and angutar distribUtions of the cross section asymmetry parameter of the investigated reaction are presented graphically. The obtained results are compared with the present experimental and theoretical data at 80 and 300 MeV photon energy. The comparison has revealed that none of the calculation methods is more preferable as well as no simple conclusion can be made on the existence of dibarin resonances\n\nDiscrete ambiguities in CP-violating asymmetries in B decays\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLondon, David\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe CP-angles Î±, Î² and Î³ can be extracted from CP-violating asymmetries in the B system, but only up to discrete ambiguities. These discrete ambiguities make it difficult to determine with certainty whether or not new physics is present. I show that, if the condition Î±+Î²+Î³=Ï is imposed, there remains a twofold ambiguity in the CP-angle set (Î±,Î²,Î³), and I discuss ways to cleanly resolve this final discrete ambiguity\n\nTotal mandibular subapical osteotomy and Le Fort I osteotomy using piezosurgery and computer-aided designed and manufactured surgical splints: a favorable combination of three techniques in the management of severe mouth asymmetry in Parry-Romberg syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nScolozzi, Paolo; Herzog, Georges\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAlthough its pathogenesis remains obscure, Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) has been associated with the linear scleroderma en coup de sabre. PRS is characterized by unilateral facial atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and bones with at least 1 dermatome supplied by the trigeminal nerve. Facial asymmetry represents the most common sequela and can involve the soft tissues, craniomaxillofacial skeleton, dentoalveolar area, and temporomandibular joint. Although orthognathic procedures have been reported for skeletal reconstruction, treatment of facial asymmetry has been directed to augmentation of the soft tissue volume on the atrophic side using different recontouring or volumetric augmentation techniques. Total mandibular subapical osteotomy has been used in the management of dentofacial deformities, such as open bite and mandibular dentoalveolar retrusion or protrusion associated with an imbalance between the lower lip and the chin. Management of orthognathic procedures has been improved by the recent introduction of stereolithographic surgical splints using computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology and piezosurgery. Piezosurgery has increased security during surgery, especially for delicate procedures associated with a high risk of nerve injury. The present report describes a combined total mandibular subapical osteotomy and Le Fort I osteotomy using piezosurgery and surgical splints fabricated using CAD and CAM for the correction of severe mouth asymmetry related to vertical dentoalveolar disharmony in a patient with PRS.

CBCT scans from 22 females with normal symmetric-looking faces (mean age 24 years and 8 months) were selected for the study. The average menton deviation was 1.01{+-}0.66 mm. The spherical coordinates, length, and midsagittal and coronal inclination angles of the ramal and mandibular lines were calculated from CBCT. The bilateral differences in the facial lines were determined. All of the study subjects had minimal bilateral differences of facial lines. The normal range of facial asymmetry of the ramal and mandibular lines was obtained in spherical coordinates. The normal range of facial asymmetry in the spherical coordinate system in this study should be useful as a reference for diagnosing facial asymmetry.\n\nASYMMETRY IN THE OUTBURST OF SN 1987A DETECTED USING LIGHT ECHO SPECTROSCOPY\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSinnott, B.; Welch, D. L.; Sutherland, P. G.; Rest, A.; Bergmann, M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe report direct evidence for asymmetry in the early phases of SN 1987A via optical spectroscopy of five fields of its light echo system. The light echoes allow the first few hundred days of the explosion to be reobserved, with different position angles providing different viewing angles to the supernova. Light echo spectroscopy therefore allows a direct spectroscopic comparison of light originating from different regions of the photosphere during the early phases of SN 1987A. Gemini multi-object spectroscopy of the light echo fields shows fine structure in the HÎ± line as a smooth function of position angle on the near-circular light echo rings. HÎ± profiles originating from the northern hemisphere of SN 1987A show an excess in redshifted emission and a blue knee, while southern hemisphere profiles show an excess of blueshifted HÎ± emission and a red knee. This fine structure is reminiscent of the 'Bochum event' originally observed for SN 1987A, but in an exaggerated form. Maximum deviation from symmetry in the HÎ± line is observed at position angles 16Â° and 186Â°, consistent with the major axis of the expanding elongated ejecta. The asymmetry signature observed in the HÎ± line smoothly diminishes as a function of viewing angle away from the poles of the elongated ejecta. We propose an asymmetric two-sided distribution of 56 Ni most dominant in the southern far quadrant of SN 1987A as the most probable explanation of the observed light echo spectra. This is evidence that the asymmetry of high-velocity 56 Ni in the first few hundred days after explosion is correlated to the geometry of the ejecta some 25 years later.\n\nMorphologic evaluation and classification of facial asymmetry using 3-dimensional computed tomography.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaek, Chaehwan; Paeng, Jun-Young; Lee, Janice S; Hong, Jongrak\n\n2012-05-01\n\nA systematic classification is needed for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of facial asymmetry. The purposes of this study were to analyze the skeletal structures of patients with facial asymmetry and to objectively classify these patients into groups according to these structural characteristics. Patients with facial asymmetry and recent computed tomographic images from 2005 through 2009 were included in this study, which was approved by the institutional review board. Linear measurements, angles, and reference planes on 3-dimensional computed tomograms were obtained, including maxillary (upper midline deviation, maxilla canting, and arch form discrepancy) and mandibular (menton deviation, gonion to midsagittal plane, ramus height, and frontal ramus inclination) measurements. All measurements were analyzed using paired t tests with Bonferroni correction followed by K-means cluster analysis using SPSS 13.0 to determine an objective classification of facial asymmetry in the enrolled patients. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to verify differences among clustered groups. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Forty-three patients (18 male, 25 female) were included in the study. They were classified into 4 groups based on cluster analysis. Their mean age was 24.3 Â± 4.4 years. Group 1 included subjects (44% of patients) with asymmetry caused by a shift or lateralization of the mandibular body. Group 2 included subjects (39%) with a significant difference between the left and right ramus height with menton deviation to the short side. Group 3 included subjects (12%) with atypical asymmetry, including deviation of the menton to the short side, prominence of the angle/gonion on the larger side, and reverse maxillary canting. Group 4 included subjects (5%) with severe maxillary canting, ramus height differences, and menton deviation to the short side. In this study, patients with asymmetry were classified into 4 statistically distinct groups according to\n\nTooth axis and skeletal structures in mandibular molar vertical sections in jaw deformity with facial asymmetry using MPR images\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNojima, Kunihiko; Yokose, Taishi; Ishii, Takenobu; Kobayashi, Makoto; Nishii, Yasushi\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate frontal morphological asymmetry in the mandibular molar region in terms of tooth axis and skeletal structures using vertical MPR sections in jaw deformity accompanied by facial asymmetry.
