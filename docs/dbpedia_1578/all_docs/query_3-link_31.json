        "text": "3. 4 5 Ukraine is experiencing exciting times – and we already have something to be proud of. This book is the first comprehen- sive review of the Ukrainian tech ecosystem. You will learn about prominent startups, accelerators, leading product com- panies, biggest investments, deals and cases. We sincerely believe that now is the best time to start your innovative business or expand it to Ukraine. We hope this book will convince you of that. We are delighted to support the development of such impor- tant guidebook. WNISEF is happy to partner with UNIT.City in this effort given how crucial such visibility for the IT eco- system and for Ukraine. It is essential that international stake- holders have more information and contact access to the breakthrough Ukrainian startups and stakeholders. Undoubtedly the technology sector has a strategic impor- tance to the Ukrainian economy and can redefine the way Ukraine is perceived globally in this age of digital transfor- mation. Max Yakover CEO and managing partner at UNIT.City innovation park Jaroslawa Z. Johnson President and CEO of Western NIS Enterprise Fund Valery Krasovsky CEO at Sigma Software Vadym Nehay CEO at Depositphotos Our company has always strived to create a favorable and stable environment for IT industry growth in Ukraine. It is a very challenging task, which clearly can’t be done by a single company. Having this in mind, Sigma Software was among the originators of the EBA IT Committee to unite efforts with the leading IT companies in Ukraine and reach the common big goal. Together we achieved a lot: in cooperation with leading universities created first strategic plan for IT education de- velopment in Ukraine, which was signed by Prime Minister; established a dialogue with State representatives; launched the first industry researches; initiated business participation in Tax Code revision; strengthened Ukraine promotion as a strong IT hub, and more. Sigma Software is glad to support UNIT.City in creation of Ukraine tech guide. We believe it will become a new step forward to attracting investments and promoting Ukraine as a country with mature IT industry, huge talent pool, and developed infrastructure. Thanks to Ukrainian products and world-class teams over the past few years, our country has become a sort of tech-phenomenon. This guide makes it possible to assess the scale and quality of the Ukrainian tech industry.\n\n4. 6 UKRAINIAN TECH INDUSTRY with offices based in Ukraine 20% world's leading companies in software development for mobile platforms Volume of IT service exports (2018F) [2] 4% of GDP $4B 16 IT service providers present in the 2019 Global Outsourcing-100 list $290M in startup investments in 2018 184 700 software developers [5] [4][3] 2nd largest export of services industry in 2018 [7] 4000 tech companies [7] [1] 100+ Fortune 500 companies have chosen Ukrainian IT services [6]\n\n5. 8 9 110+ R&D centres owned by multinational corporations 33 investment deals 8 19 exits in 2017 1000+ events for IT specialists, startups and investors every year 50+ coworking spaces and hubs an innovation district in Kyiv 146 000 patents and utility models since 2007 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 9 30 industry communities 2017 It is ranked 24th best country for software development [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [12] [13]\n\n6. 10 TRENDS Investment funds grow in number 43rd out of 126 countries in 2018 [14] According to the GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX, Ukraine is ranked Startup Investments [15] In 2018 the following funds have been established Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF) has launched $365M $265M = 44 deals with investment companies for investment in startups 7 20172016 4 8 12 16 20 Growth in exit numbers 19 2017 — Rise of the ICO 20172013 2 2.5 3 3.5 Growing volumes of IT services 4 $3.6B 237% 180% 19 successful ICOs $160M attracted 20+ funds operating in Ukraine [16] [16]\n\n7. 12 13 STARTUP INVESTMENTS 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 $97M 76 88 78 69 44 $42M $146M $80M $265M Investment volumes Number of deals IT SERVICE EXPORTS 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 $2B $2.4B $2.6B $3.1B $3.6BIT service export volumes\n\n8.
