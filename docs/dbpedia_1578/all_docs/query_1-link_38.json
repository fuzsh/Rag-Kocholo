        "text": "The historic Andriyivsky Uzviz Street has long been connecting the Upper Town with Podil.\n\nThe rough stone-paved road winds steeply between old one- and two-story houses. This is a colorful place that preserves the spirit of old Kyiv, favored by artists and souvenir sellers, and there are always many tourists here.\n\nIn the upper part of Andriyivsky Uzviz there is Saint Andrew's Church, below are museums, theaters, art galleries, antique shops, restaurants and cafes.\n\nThe Bulhakov Museum is open in the Turbiny House (Andriyivsky descent, 13), where the writer created the White Guard. A monument to Bulhakov has been erected near the museum.\n\n\"Castle of Richard the Lionheart\" (Andriyivsky descent, 15) is a profitable house of the merchant Orlov in the English Neo-Gothic style. Opposite - the stairs to the top of the Castle Hill (the wooden castle stood during the Polish-Lithuanian rule in the XV-XVII centuries).\n\nThe Museum of One Street is located in building No. 2B.\n\nThe temple, dedicated to Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, is located on the historical site known as \"Askold's grave\" (in ancient times - the Hungarian tract).\n\nIn 882, Prince Oleh killed the Kyiv rulers Askold and Dir here. Since the time of Princess Olha, the wooden church of Saint Nicholas has stood here (according to another version, the burial place of the first Christian prince Askold is located higher, on the top of the hill in the area of the current Slava Square).\n\nThe stone temple in the form of a rotunda was built in the 19th century according to the project of the architect Andrii Melenskyi.\n\nIn 1918, Kyiv patriotic students who died in the battle with the Bolsheviks near Kruty were buried at the Askold grave. During Soviet times, a park was built on the territory of the cemetery. Recently, the cross in memory of the heroes of Kruty has been restored.\n\nA memorial sign was installed (1997, architect Janos Vih) dedicated to the events of the 9th century, when the tribes of Ugrians (Hungarians) stopped at the Askold grave on their way from the Volha region to present-day Hungary.\n\nNowadays, in the lower part of the Church of Saint Nicholas, three memorial signs have been installed, on which the history of the latest Russian-Ukrainian war is engraved: the first - in honor of the \"Cyborgs\" who defended the Donetsk airport, the second - to the defenders of Debaltsevo, the third - to the heroes of Ilovaisk. A chapel called \"military\" was also rebuilt and restored. Paintings in the chapel were made by the famous artist Maryna Sochenko. The paintings depict prominent military figures, from the Kyiv princes and hetmans to the present day - portraits of Symon Petlyura, Yevhen Konovalets, Andriy Melnyk, Stepan Bandera, Roman Shukhevych, Oleh Olzhych, Olena Teliha, as well as Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred.\n\nTherefore, Askold's grave becomes the pantheon of the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe Dormition Church of the Virgin of Pyrohoshcha is the oldest church preserved in its original form in Podil.\n\nIt was built at the behest of Prince Mstislav the Great for the icon of the Mother of God Pirhotissa, i.e. \"tower\" brought from Constantinople (the bell tower of the Blacherna Monastery was depicted next to the Mother of God). Probably, the unusual overseas word in the vernacular split into two interrelated ones: \"pie\" (bread) and \"guests\" (merchants) - \"Pyrohoshcha\".\n\nAccording to the \"Word about Igor's Regiment\", Prince Igor thanked the Holy Virgin of Pyrohoshcha in this church for his rescue from Polovtsian captivity.\n\nIn the 16th-19th centuries, the Church of the Dormition of the Holy Mother of God in Pyrohoshcha was the cathedral church of Podil. Magisterial ceremonies were held here, and the city archive was kept.\n\nIt was destroyed under Soviet power in 1935, restored in 1998 in its original Byzantine forms.\n\nThe Church of the Saviour at Berestove is an ancient temple located behind the northern wall of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra.\n\nBerestovt (now the territory of Glory Park) was the suburban residence of Prince Volodymyr the Great of Kyiv and his descendants.\n\nIt is believed that the construction of the temple in this place was started by Volodymyr Monomakh in the 12th century as the main cathedral of the Transfiguration Monastery - the residence of the princes of the Monomakhovych family. His daughters Yevfimiya and Sophia are buried here, as well as the founder of Moscow, Yuriy Dolhoruky, and his son, Prince of Kyiv, Hlib Yuriyovych.\n\nIn the 17th-18th centuries, the temple was reconstructed and became five-domed, the interiors were painted by Kyiv and Athos masters. In the 19th century, the architect Andriy Melensky added a bell tower to it.\n\nThe Church of the Savior on Berestove has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1990.\n\nThe famous Kyiv \"House with Chimeras\" is one of the most extravagant creations of the architect Vladyslav Horodetskyi (he lived in this building until 1920).\n\nThe house is located on a steep cave slope, has three floors on one side, and six on the other. The facades are decorated with intricate sculptures on the themes of ancient myths and hunting, which served primarily as an advertisement for a new building material - cement. The legend attributes the gloomy sculptural subjects to the grief of Horodetskyi for his daughter who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn Soviet times, the building was a communal building, then a hospital of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Currently, it is a small residence for receptions of the President of Ukraine. Excursions are organized by the Kyiv History Museum. The Administration of the President of Ukraine is located opposite.\n\nThe palace in Baroque style was built in Klov (present-day Lypky), in the possessions of the Kyiv Pechersk Monastery, to house the honored guests of the Lavra.\n\nThe authors of the project were the German architect Yohan Schedel and the Ukrainian architect Pero Neelov, the construction was supervised by the self-taught serf architect Stepan Kovnir. In 1863, the third floor was completed. The interior was painted by Ukrainian artists in 1757.\n\nKlovsky Palace was never destined to serve its purpose - representatives of the royal court who visited Kyiv did not stay here. The palace briefly housed the Lavra printing house, later a military hospital. Later, various educational institutions were located in it, and in Soviet times - museums.\n\nIn recent years, the building was completely restored, and it housed the Supreme Court of Ukraine. The walls and ceiling were decorated with sculptures of ancient Roman and ancient Greek gods of justice and fairness. The furniture is made according to the author's drawings in the style of the middle of the 18th century.\n\nExcursions are planned.\n\nThe central square of the Lower City, on the site of which was the main market of ancient Kyiv.\n\nIn the 13th-18th centuries, Kontraktova Square was the administrative center of the city and the venue for the Contract Fairs, the Magistrate's building with the Voytova Tower was located here, with which the decisions of the city authorities were announced (it was built in 1714, burned down in 1812).\n\nIn the center of the square is the Guest House (1809-1811), where merchants who came to fairs stayed. Nearby is the \"Samson\" fountain (1754), which was part of the ancient water supply and attracted pilgrims with the legend of the healing properties of its water. The square also houses the Contract House (1815-1817), which served as a venue for concerts and balls.\n\nThe tall bell tower of the Greek Church of Saint Catherine (1741), restored in the 1970s, stands out. Its premises now belong to the National Bank.\n\nMariyinskyi Palace is one of the most beautiful palaces in Ukraine.\n\nThe imposing building in the Baroque style was built in 1750-1755 according to the project of the architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli for the empress Yelyzaveta Petrivna, who personally chose the place for it. During the highest visits to Kyiv, members of the royal family stayed here, including Catherine II, who visited Kyiv in 1787. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the palace served as the residence of the governor-generals of the Kyiv province.\n\nCurrently, the Mariyinskyi Palace is the ceremonial residence of the President of Ukraine, where receptions at the highest level take place. Many decorated interiors in the style of classicism with baroque and renaissance elements, antique furniture, chandeliers, paintings by famous artists, and wall paintings have been preserved.\n\nInitially, the main facade faced the City (Royal) Garden, laid out in 1748 by order of Empress Elizabeth. On the opposite side of the palace (the current front) is the broken Mariyinskyi Park, which bears the name of Empress Mariay Oleksandrivna. A scandalous high-rise building was erected on the territory of the park, which became the highest (above sea level) residential building in Kyiv.\n\nMore than 100 realistic figures of prominent figures of Ukrainian history are presented in the exposition of the innovative museum \"Making of Ukrainian Nation\" in Kyiv.\n\nIt is located on the territory of the National Museum of History of Ukraine in the Second World War, on the back of the pedestal of the Motherland.\n\nDuring the two-hour tour, visitors will get acquainted with the centuries-old history of the Ukrainian nation and its protagonists: kings and hetmans, military and scientists, artists and athletes.\n\nThe exposition consists of 25 plot compositions that model various historical scenes or reproduce real events in the history of Ukraine in chronological order: prehistoric period from Trypillya culture to the early Slavs, Kyivan Rus (Princess Olha, Svyatoslav the Brave, Volodymyr the Great, Yaroslav the Wise), Cossack era (Prince Kostyantyn Ostrozky, Dmytro \"Bayda\" Vyshnevetsky, Petro Konashevych-Sahaydachny, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Ivan Vyhovsky, Ivan Mazepa and Pylyp Orlyk), periods of nation revival (Hryhoriy Skovoroda, Taras Shevchenko, Lesya Ukrayinka, etc.), of Ukrainian Revolution (Mykhaylo Hrushevsky, Symon Petlyura, etc.), of liberation movements (Stepan Bandera, Andriy Melnyk, Roman Shukhevych), of modernity (Ihgor Sikorsky, Mykola Amosov, Vyacheslav Chornovil, Bohdan Stupka, etc.).\n\nEach installation is accompanied by interactive audio and video content combined with special effects that immerse the viewer in the atmosphere of the era. Dioramas, multimedia stands, interactive screens, maps, holograms are presented. Media guides in eight languages are available to visitors. The installations are specially designed as photo locations. Separate stands are adapted for children. There are recreation areas, cafes, souvenir shop.\n\nAccording to the project \"Inclusive Travels in Ukraine: accessibility of museums of Ukraine\", this innovation Museum with three-dimensional sculptures of figures in the history of Ukraine has a barrier-free exhibition space.\n\nThe National Academic Drama Theater named after Ivan Franko is the most popular in Kyiv.\n\nThe theater building was built in 1898 on Mykolayivska Square, which appeared on the site of a filled-in pond, which was located in the estate of the Kyiv professor Mering.\n\nThe theater premises were built by architects Eduard-Ferdynand Bradtman and Heorhiy Shleifer for Mykola Solovtsov's Society of Dramatic Artists theater, which later became the basis of the troupe of another Kyiv theater named after Lesya Ukrainka. The audience hall is decorated in Rococo style.\n\nIn 1919, the Solovtsov Theater was nationalized and transformed into the Second Lenin Theater of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1926, the theater building became a permanent stage for the theater group named after Ivan Franko. The theatrical season of 1926 in the renamed theater opened with the production \"Eyelashes\" based on the work of Mykola Hohol and adapted by Ostap Vyshnya.\n\nPeople's Artist of the USSR and Ukraine Bohdan Stupka was the artistic director of the Ivan Franko Theater for a long time.\n\n\"Natalka Poltavka\", \"Shelmenko-Denshchik\", \"Pygmalion\", \"Shveik\" are considered the most successful productions from the modern repertoire.\n\nThe magnificent 19-domed Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv is the oldest architectural monument of Rus, one of the largest Christian churches of its time, a UNESCO world cultural heritage site.\n\nThe temple complex of the Sophia Monastery is located in the historical center of Kyiv, on Starokyivska Hill, within the City of Prince Yaroslav.\n\nAccording to the latest research, Saint Sophia Cathedral was founded by the Kyiv prince Volodymyr the Great in 1011, and it was built no later than 1018. Earlier it was believed that the cathedral was erected in 1037 in honor of the victory of Yaroslav the Wise over the Pechenegs, as indicated in the Tale of Bygone Years. A grandiose building for those times with a very complex structure was built by Byzantine craftsmen on the model of the Cathedral of Saint Sophia in Constantinople.\n\nThe temple acquired the current Ukrainian Baroque style during the reign of Hetman Ivan Mazepa as a result of the reconstruction initiated by Metropolitan Petro Mohyla, carried out in the 17th century by the Italian architect Oktaviano Manchini. The interiors have preserved priceless ancient Rus mosaics and frescoes, including the iconic mosaic image of the Mother of God of Oranta.\n\nSaint Sophia Cathedral was the main temple of the Kyiv state, under its arches ceremonial entrances to the grand prince's throne, church cathedrals and receptions took place. Buried in the church are Prince Yaroslav the Wise, his wife Iryna (Ingigerda) and son Vsevolod with his family, Prince Volodymyr Monomakh, and many Kyiv metropolitans. A valuable source of historical information is numerous ancient graffiti, which can be considered an unofficial chronicle of the Saint Sophia Cathedral and the entire Rus-Ukraine of the 11th-18th centuries.\n\nToday the National Reserve \"Sophia of Kyiv\" unites 77 architectural monuments. Around the cathedral there are monastic buildings of the 17th-18th centuries: the house of the metropolitan, the fraternal building, a bursa, a refectory, a bakery, cells and a hotel. The complex is surrounded by a wall with Zaborovskiy gates and a southern entrance tower. The bell tower, which serves as the main gate, is open to the public.\n\nOn the square in front of the bell tower, there is the grave of Volodymyr, Patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate, who was buried at the entrance to Sophia on Black Tuesday, July 18, 1995 after a violent clash between believers and police.\n\nThere is also a tactile model of the cathedral with relief plaques in front of the entrance. The reserve is made more accessible thanks to an inclusive information center.\n\nSeparate objects of the reserve are the Golden Gate, Saint Andrew's Church and Saint Cyril's Church in Kyiv, the Genoese Fortress in Crimea."
