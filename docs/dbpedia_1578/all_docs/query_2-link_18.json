The idea of the volume goes back to discussions with my colleague Manfred Hettling from the University of Halle-Wittenberg, about the work of the German historian Reinhart Koselleck and the American historian George L. Mosse on fallen soldiers in modern history. The St. Gallen project on ‘Region, Nation and Beyond. Transcultural and interdisciplinary reconceptualization of Ukraine’ offered since 2012 an opportunity to study the topic in more detail and to organize an international conference on the subject in 2015 at the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. Our work had already begun and the preparations for the conference started, as the Euromaidan and the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war in eastern Ukraine took place. To some extent these events shaped the further development of the project and the planned volume. My colleague Iryna Sklokina from Kharkiv and Lviv and myself took up new jobs, were able to invite additional contributors to the volume resulting from the conference, whereas other authors were hindered in submitting a chapter. We are both convinced that there is a need for a more theory- and methodology-driven work in Ukrainian studies, and in particular in Ukrainian historical research. The need for it has been addressed repeatedly but only rarely realized. General histories of the political cult of the dead have stressed its global character, also considering its specific European shaping in modern history. In larger regions of Europe, but less so in parts of Eastern Europe including Russia, the cults of heroes and in particular of fallen soldiers has been replaced in the past decades by an attitude of de-heroization and self-reflexion. Ukraine with its history in the 20th and 21st century presents a distinct story in this regard. Nationand state-building took a unique development and it seems to be, more than elsewhere in Europe, an unfinished political process. The principal aim of our volume is to critically analyse Ukrainian narratives of sacrifice, martyrdom and heroization by studying them in their contexts. These phenomena have been too\n\n8\n\nPreface\n\noften the objects of politically driven scape-goating and self-legitimation, rather than of critical studies. We are happy to present the present volume, which took its time and effort. We are grateful to Ulrich Schmid, the supervisor of the St. Gallen project, to Manfred Hettling, University of Halle-Wittenberg, and Carmen Scheide, University of Bern, for their critical support on the conference and afterwards, and to the support by Boris Ganichev, Duncan Bare, Marietta Kausch, Melanie Hussinger and Olha Martyniuk for their help in completing the volume.

The editors\n\nGuido Hausmann (Regensburg)\n\nThe Political Cult of the Dead in Ukraine. An Introduction\n\n1.\n\nSketching out the concept\n\nThe present volume offers a new perspective on the political cult of the dead, exemplified by explorations in the history of Ukraine in the 20th and 21st century. The country has attracted broader political and scholarly attention since its political independence in 1991, but the real breakthrough came with the Euromaidan of 2013/14 (the Revolution of Dignity). Historians outside Ukraine have mostly dealt with a few selected topics, whereas the history of the country during World War II in a broader European context stands out as a key subject. Ukrainian state- and nation-building, as well as the history of nationalism might be added as a second topic of broader interest. The volume addresses both of these themes, along with other topics of Ukrainian history, by offering detailed studies on the political cult of the dead, which essentially comprises the public mourning, honouring and remembering of the fallen soldiers by means of monuments, memorials and public commemorative rituals. As the cult of the war dead is closely linked with the legitimacy of the political order, the volume incorporates also studies on political leader cults. The volume has two general goals. The first is to integrate Ukrainian history and historical scholarship into broader conceptual debates on state- and nationbuilding. To this end we employ new regional and transnational perspectives in order to gain a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the country’s past in European and global settings. Second, it wishes to place the Euromaidan and current political processes into a historical perspective. Indeed, this major event in Ukrainian recent history lent a great amount of political relevance and new meaning to the subject matter of our volume. In Kyiv and in other cities of Ukraine a new cult of the dead has emerged around the fallen defenders of the Euromaidan (the Nebesna Sotnia or Heavenly Hundred). It has changed the outlook and symbolism of public spaces, adding a new political dimension to them, which had to be tackled by our analysis. Choosing this perspective, the volume does not explore civilian death in Ukraine, like the Holodomor or World\n\n10\n\nGuido Hausmann\n\nWar II, both of them important topics that have attracted significant scholarly attention recently. The recent changes, historical continuities, forms and functions of the emerging political cult(s) of the dead will be analysed in the context of older cults from pre-Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet times in various Ukrainian regions until the end of the presidency of Petro Poroshenko in 2019. The Euromaidan has called forth many important questions on national history. Tragically, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war in parts of Eastern Ukraine has been adding many new military and civil casualties to those of 2014 and thus many more narratives, myths and cults to the history of the Euromaidan. The ‘political cult of the dead’ as a historical concept has been introduced into historical scholarship since the 1970s by the historians Reinhart Koselleck (1923– 2006) and George L. Mosse (1918–1999). According to Koselleck the modern cult of fallen soldiers originated in Europe since the end of the 18th century. It displays several structural and functional similarities. First, its aesthetic embodiment in material objects (monuments and memorials) remained astonishingly similar and resistant to changes in the past two centuries. Second, in connection with the rise of general compulsory military service, the violent death of fallen soldiers forced states (in the better fitting formulation of Koselleck: “politische Handlungseinheiten,” political entities) and their political leaders both to its legitimization and justification. Conversely the violent death of fallen soldiers could legitimize the secular state politically after the eclipse of the previously dominating dynastic death cult. Third, Koselleck noticed a growing “democratization of death,” in the sense that the death of all fallen soldiers, regardless of their status and rank, became considered worth of public commemoration. The death of the ordinary soldier, as well as the officer, had to be explained and legitimized because they fought and died for the state as volunteers or conscripts. After World War I a custom emerged in the newly established war cemeteries to commemorate every dead soldier by name, separating them from the civil casualties of the war. Fourth, the modern cult of the fallen soldier replaced previous religious interpretations, which had faded, secularization replaced the hope for resurrection by the hope for the eternal life of a state. This too strengthened the remembrance of every fallen soldier individually. Fifth, the cult manifested itself in many different forms, but it was most often devoted to the unity of the patria.1 Roughly at the same time when Koselleck worked on the concept, in 1990, the American historian George L. Mosse published his monograph on the formation 1 Koselleck, Reinhart: ‘Kriegerdenkmale als Identifizierungen der Überlebenden’, in: Marquard, Odo / Stierle, Karlheinz (eds.): Identität. Munich 1979, p. 255–276; english translation Koselleck, Reinhart: ‘War Memorials: Identity Formations of the Survivors’, in: I.d.: The Practices of Conceptual History: Timing History, Spacing Concepts. Stanford 2002; more systematically Koselleck, Reinhart: ‘Einleitung’, in: I.d. / Jeismann, Michael (eds.): Der politische Totenkult. Kriegerdenkmäler in der Moderne. Munich 1994, p. 9–20.\n\nThe Political Cult of the Dead in Ukraine. An Introduction\n\n11\n\nof the myth of the war experience in modern Europe from the late 18th century to the interwar period of the 20th century. In many ways Mosse touched upon the same themes as Koselleck and was arriving at similar hypotheses and conclusions. He deployed the term civic religion in reference to the cult of the fallen soldier.2 Mosse regarded World War I and the interwar period as one when this cult achieved a peak, whereas “the Second World War broke with the traditional cult of the war dead, abolishing war memorials and seeking to memorialize the dead in a more pragmatic and functional manner.”3 Mosse and Koselleck discussed the cult primarily on the basis of the history of France and Germany, European countries with different traditions of nation- and state-building. World War I was of major importance for the development of the cults in both countries. As Mosse has put it with regard to the German case: “The cult of the fallen soldier became a centrepiece of the religion of nationalism after the war, having its greatest political impact in nations like Germany which had lost the war and had been brought to the edge of chaos by the transition from war to peace.”4 The confrontation with mass death permeated and polarized “much of public life, marking a new stage in the history of nationalism.”5 Taking the perspective of the geo-political periphery of Europe, in this case of Ukraine, two ideas immediately come to mind: first, its history of fragmented state building, its specific process of nation building and nationalism, and second, differences of temporality vis-à-vis Western Europe. For sure, the cult of the war dead did not cease in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union with World War II, and features of Mosse’s “traditional cult of the war dead” can be discovered in addition with new elements still in the early 21st century. The history of the political cult of the dead in Ukraine has its specific difficult traits, which sets it in many ways apart from the ‘core’ European history of the cult, explored by Koselleck and Mosse, but its characteristics make it certainly a member of the European and global family of similar cults. More recently the historian Manfred Hettling has opened up the topic for global and comparative historical analysis and added some important nuances to its semantics.6 He underlined and further differentiated the definitions provided\n\n2 Mosse, George L.: Fallen Soldiers.

International\n\n12\n\nGuido Hausmann\n\nby Koselleck, based on the many functional and structural similarities of the modern cult (in terms of its memorialisation, individualisation, equalisation, democratization, emotionalization and a tension between secularisation and sacralisation); he stressed the influence of state- and nation-building processes as well as religious and other cultural traditions in its multiple manifestations. Also, he distinguished between various types of political ties, which were ascribed historically to the war dead: bonds to a single person (eg. a king, a military leader, a charismatic leader), to a community (people or a nation) and to a political unit, like a state. In Central and Western Europe, the first type of these ties has lost much of its historical importance since the late 18th century, which had important consequences for the legitimacy of war dead.7 Hettling also addressed the differences in the manifestations of the cult within and beyond Europe, here focusing particularly on Japan.8 Historians of Eastern Europe are usually sceptical, when it comes to the benefit of the application of western concepts in Eastern European and global settings. Although the caution is well grounded, the author of this text encourages an exploratory approach to the theme, in order to structure research on war commemoration, to facilitate comparison and ask about cultural exchanges and transfers.9 The volume opens up this particular research on Ukraine, linking it thus to contexts and concepts with the hope for inviting amendments and reformulations.\n\n2.\n\nSpecific manifestations in Ukraine\n\nFor a closer analysis of the political meaning of mourning, honouring and remembering of the fallen in Ukraine in the 20th and 21st century, at least three key features have to be addressed in more detail. One feature is the relation of the cult to Ukrainian state- and nation-building, a second one is the presence of religious and other cultural traditions of commemorations, while the third is the relation between the commemoration of the military dead and civil death in Ukrainian history.

An Introduction\n\n13\n\nRecent historical scholarship on Ukraine shows a remarkable and partly disturbing diversity of views on its state- and nation-building process. This applies both for historians living in Ukraine and also beyond its borders, whether belonging to the diaspora or not. In addition, abrupt political changes like the one in 2014, followed by the Euromaidan, and changing intellectual trends in historical scholarship have repeatedly yielded publications summarizing the state of the art and offering yet newer research perspectives.10 Critical studies of the Ukrainian national narrative advocated an understanding of its history as an open process for a people who lived only for very short time periods in a nation state (in 1917–20, after 1991). They were conscious of the dependence of their country for long on non-Ukrainian larger political structures. At the same time, these studies rejected a teleological understanding of Ukrainian history and narratives of putatively century-long struggles of a nation for building its own state. On the contrary, national historical narratives, resulting from the Ukrainian historical scholarship of the early 20th century, emphasized Ukrainian state building in the Middle Ages (Kyiv Rus) and in early modern history (the Cossack state of the 17th century). They stressed the anti-imperial and anti-colonial struggle of the Ukrainian nation against the Russian Empire and the Soviet state, understanding Soviet Ukraine as a colony or a fully Moscow-controlled Soviet republic. They tended to marginalize culturally grey zones with mixed loyalties and hybrid identification, in the centre as well as in regions and peripheries. Many historians opted for differentiated interpretations between these two poles. Wars were of central importance in Ukrainian state-building, similar to many other European polities. Ukrainians had lived for long time in nonUkrainian hegemonic states, a fact which reduced drastically the possibilities to express nationhood in the public and the legal sphere, and to launch debates on cultural and other understandings of this category. This sets the Ukrainian case apart from many other European nations and has likewise affected the political cult of the dead on its territory and beyond, in the diaspora.\n\n10 Publications which propose an opening up of Ukrainian history are Plokhy, Serhii (ed.): The Future of the Past.

Plokhy and Yuri Slezkine).\n\n14\n\nGuido Hausmann\n\nWestern historical scholarship on Ukraine11 distinguishes several typical features of the history of Ukrainian nation- and state-building, which should be briefly mentioned as a general backdrop of this volume: (1) early modern nation-building in the 17th–18th centuries which resulted in a state-like project of the Cossack Hetmanate after 1649 and was suspended step-by-step by Poland and imperial Russia until its final suspension under Catherine II; (2) Ukrainian national aspirations in the late 19th and early 20th century, similar to other cultural and political expressions of the modern nation across Europe, which led to two failed state projects at the end of World War I: in Western Ukraine and in Dnipro (Russian) Ukraine, where a new form of interwar Ukrainian political order was established, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic; (3) the emergence of radical Ukrainian ethno-nationalism in interwar Poland, seeking state independence in the manner of other nations and states in Eastern Central Europe after World War I. It led to (at least temporary) collaboration with Nazi Germany before and in 1941, hoping in vain to establish a Ukrainian nation state in summer 1941 and it also led to participation in war crimes. This state project failed again, but the Soviet victory in the war contributed to a territorial enlargement of the Ukrainian Soviet republic; (4) the collapse of the Soviet Union and the successful emergence of a Ukrainian nation-state in 1991, which has shown, in 2004 and in 2013–14, attempts to gain more than formal independence and establish it as a sovereign political subject in Europe. The volume comprises articles with different understandings of the general Ukrainian historical process, in particular with regard to its state- and nationbuilding, but they all share a critical attitude to their subject of study and aim at contextualizing and historicizing specific case studies on the political cult of the dead. According to Koselleck the modern commemoration of fallen soldiers in Europe has replaced to a large extent a previous victory cult which has given political leaders as monarchs or generals central place. The relation between the two can be therefore considered crucial and the volume has thus included articles on leader cults to address this topic and relationship in more detail. 11 See the excellent recent general histories by Kappeler, Andreas: Kleine Geschichte der Ukraine. 5., überarbeitete und aktualisierte Auflage.

Oxford 2007.\n\nThe Political Cult of the Dead in Ukraine. An Introduction\n\n15\n\nA second feature of the manifestation of the cult of the fallen in Ukraine is the impact of religious and other traditions. The Ukrainian case can contribute to the criticism of the secularization hypothesis, emphasized particularly by Koselleck. The image of a historically formed nation, possessing in premodern times a particular religious understanding of life and the world and undergoing a complete secularization is simplifying. This is true not only regarding the modern world, but also the premodern times, when traditions that shaped the modern cult of the dead were formed. Of particular importance for modern Ukraine was that Greek Catholic priests represented the majority of the national elite in Western Ukraine (Eastern Galicia) in the late 19th and early 20th century. Another important aspect was that the Soviet regime repressed the manifestations of religion and the Church, enforcing an atheist ideology. Religion and church structures and activities resurfaced since the late 1980s and were part, though in partly modified form, of the national revival.12 But religious and other traditions also present a particular challenge in the Ukrainian case because the nation and the polity is historically shaped by religious diversity, and larger parts of the Ukrainian population adhered to Orthodox churches (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow patriarchate, Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan patriarchate, Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church), to the Greek Catholic Church, to protestant churches, not to mention the religious commitments of other ethnic or national groups.13 As a result a variegated picture emerges, showing religious adherences and specific state-church relations, which played out historically and geographically very differently. Importantly, historical research explores also cultural traces, terms and their meanings, which are rooted in religion, above all in Christianity. For instance, Uilleam Blacker discussed the relevance of martyrdom in Ukrainian cultural history from the mid 19th century up to the present.14 Juraj Buzalka did an anthropological study of the rituals commemorating the dead heroes and martyrs, especially participants of WWII guerrilla and interethnic violence, devel12 On the Greek Catholic priests see the seminal work by Himka, John-Paul: The Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian Society in Austrian Galicia.

In addition to religion, popular beliefs and political traditions related to death and the veneration of dead heroes, had an impact. The importance of borrowing and contestation in the spread of the political cult of the fallen soldiers is convincingly shown in the work by Oksana Vynnyk, which shows the interrelations between the commemorations of the fallen soldiers and claims to social benefits, community life, and postwar adaptation of the disabled veterans. All this takes place in a situation of two competing nationalizing discourses (Polish and Ukrainian) in interwar Lviv under Polish rule.16 This leads to the third feature of the manifestation of the cult, the historical relation between the commemoration of military dead and civil death. Important to note is the close link between the military and the political spheres in the political tradition of Ukraine. The military leadership is firmly embedded in the country’s political tradition and its public memory. The most important, archetypical figure of a political and military leader cult in this tradition is the early modern Cossack leader, hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi (1595–1657). His cult as a talented military leader and a wise politician was established above all in the Cossack chronicles of the early 18th century in the Cossack Hetmanate17 and resurfaced in the 19th century. After thirty years of planning a renowned monument was dedicated to him in St. Sophia Square in central Kyiv in 1888, showing a statue of the hetman as an equestrian with a bulava (ceremonial mace). In his quality as a Cossack hetman, he was the military leader of an anti-Polish uprising, at the same time a political leader and state-builder, and he was seen as a symbol for close Ukrainian-Russian relations, as Khmelnytskyi accepted in 1654 the political dominance of Moscow as a protection against Poland. His cult had been challenged from various sides throughout the centuries and his opponents depicted him temporarily even as a bandit. The image of Khmelnytskyi remained controversial throughout the Soviet regime, more negatively in the 1920s and 1930s, more positive during World War II (a decoration of honour bearing his\n\n15 Buzalka, Juraj: Nation and Religion: The Politics and Commemoration in South Eastern Poland, Berlin 2007. 16 Vynnyk, Oksana: Postwar “Normalization”: The Reintegration of Disabled Veterans to Civilian Life in Interwar Lviv.

Yet, Khmelnytskyi seems to have constituted “one of the few symbols of permitted Ukrainian identity in the Soviet period” before his image became more diverse and less heroic in postSoviet Ukraine.19 Little is known about the cults of the political and military leaders of the Ukrainian revolution from 1917–1920, such as Symon Petliura, the important military and political leader of the Ukrainian People’s Republic.20 Cults of political leaders of Soviet Ukraine enjoyed only limited success. One of the first and historically failed attempts to create and impose a political cult of the dead in Soviet Ukraine was the cult of Mykola O. Shchors (1895–1919) in the 1930s. According to the Ukrainian-Russian film director Oleksandr Dovzhenko (1894– 1956), Stalin contacted him in 1935 on the occasion of the first congress of Soviet filmmakers and suggested to create a “Ukrainian Chapaev”, that is, a Ukrainian equivalent to the Russian civil war hero Vasilii I. Chapaev (1887–1919).21 Shchors had grown up in a wealthy peasant family in northern Ukraine (Chernihiv province) and served in the Russian army in World War I as a rank-and-file soldier, climbing up to the rank of an officer (lieutenant) in 1918. Back at home he started a career as a partisan, distinguishing himself as commander of a regiment and the first Soviet Ukrainian division fighting the German occupation forces, the Ukrainian People’s Republic and the Polish intervention in 1919, particular in central and right bank Ukraine (Chernihiv and Zhytomyr province). He was remembered as the Soviet commander of Kyiv in 1919, the circumstances of whose death in 1919 remained obscure. Shchors was remembered during the 1920s mostly by his followers (his wife, comrades) and his cult emerged only in the early 1930s. However, it never gained broader recognition or popularity and the cult of the Soviet Ukrainian hero vanished with the collapse of the Soviet Ukraine. It could never surpass the cult of Khmelnytskyi and had something of an artificial air around it.\n\n18 Yekelchyk, Serhy: ‘Stalinist Patriotism as Imperial Discourse: Reconciling the Ukrainian and Russian ‘Heroic Pasts’ 1939–45’, in: Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 2002/3(1), p. 51–80. 19 Sysyn, ‘The Changing Image of the Hetman’, p. 544. 20 On Petliura in contemporary Ukraine see Paul, Matthew D.: ‘Symon Petliura, the Ukrainian People’s Republic, and National Commemoration in Contemporary Ukraine’, in: GłowackaGrajper, Małgorzata / Wylegała, Anna (eds.): The Burden of the Past: History, Memory, and Identity in Contemporary Ukraine.

The Canadian historian Serhy Yekelchyk has shown the twists in the emerging political cults in Kyiv, after the Red Army entered the city in early November 1943 and a limited space opened for mourning and celebrating. The Soviet authorities encouraged the commemoration of military dead and local heroes, instead of mourning and publically commemorating the victims of Nazi occupation. The tomb of Master Sergeant Nykyfor Sholudenko in central Kyiv became a popular place for public commemoration, as Sholudenko was killed in November 1943 with the first tank entering the city center. Yekelchyk called the tomb “a local equivalent of the Unknown Soldier”.22 The commemoration was gradually replaced by the cult of the commander of the First Ukrainian Front (which liberated Kyiv), Army General Nikolai Vatutin, who died in April 1944 in an attack of Ukrainian nationalist guerrillas in Western Ukraine. In January 1948 a monument dedicated to him was unveiled in Kyiv.23 The veneration and commemoration of Vatutin was much more to the taste of the Ukrainian party leaders, and especially to Nikita S. Khrushchev who painted Vatutin as Stalin’s disciple. During Soviet times more leader cults emerged and were imposed, dedicated not only to Lenin, the symbol of the Soviet state and the Bolshevik party, but also to the leaders of the Soviet Ukrainian Communist party (e. g. Pavel Postyshev in the 1930s, later to Nikita S. Khrushchev), but on the whole it seems that the Soviet regime did not insist on Soviet Ukrainian leader cults. In this way the cult of Khmelnytskyi remained the most important in this genre until the end of the Soviet Union. More recently the cult of the early modern hetman Ivan Mazepa (1639–1709) has started taking shape, who again represents the close relationship between military and political power and who gained fame for siding with the Swedish king against Russia’s tsar Peter I in 1709 and struggling for a Ukraine, separate from Russia.24 The cult of Stepan Bandera, the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), founded in 1929 in Western Ukraine, regained some prominence after 1991 in Western Ukraine, but cannot be considered a leadership cult of that kind because he did not exert political or military 22 Yekelchyk, Serhy: ‘Dear Departed Comrades: State Mourning Rituals and National Identity in Postwar Ukraine’ (Paper presented at the ASN World Convention, Columbia University, 18– 20 April 2013), p. 4–5. 23 Yekelchyk, Serhy: ‘The Leader, the Victory, and the Nation: Public Celebration in Soviet Ukraine under Stalin (Kiev, 1943–1953)’, in: Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas 2006/54(1), p. 3–19, 12. 24 A first monumental statue of Mazepa was opened in 2016 in the city of Poltava in central Ukraine, see Klymenko, Lina: ‘Choosing Mazepa over Lenin: The Transformation of Monuments and Political Order in Post-Maidan Ukraine’, in: Europe-Asia Studies 2020/72(5), p. 1– 22, 11–17; Hausmann, Guido: ‘Poltava 2009: Deimperializing an Imperial Site of Memory’, in: Plokhy, Serhii (ed.), Poltava 1709: The Battle and the Myth.

An Introduction\n\n19\n\npower.25 The military leaders of UPA, such as Klym Savur, Roman Shukhevych, and Taras Bulba-Borovets, became actively commemorated mostly on the regional level. As Yulia Yurchuk convincingly shows, these cults developed in a situation of continuance of Soviet-style institutions and political elites – as the only possible kind of “symbolic” redemption.26 The cult of Cossack leaders is embedded in the broader revival of the Cossack myth in Ukrainian society in the late 19th century, during World War II and again since the late 1980s (and in particular beginning with 2014).27 As Cossacks represent a nation in arms, the cult further blurs the dividing line between military dead and civil dead. In addition, of crucial importance for Ukrainian national self-perception is the role of volunteers in defence of the nation, which could build on the central figure of the Cossack warrior. In the 20th century soldiers with Ukrainian background served in non-Ukrainian armies, above all in the Russian and the Habsburg corps during World War I28 and in the Soviet Army during World War II. As these armies were supranational, Ukrainian soldiers showed variegated attitudes of loyalty, depending on their political beliefs and on the political situations. Such contexts were first, the collapse of the Russian empire during World War I and of the Habsburg and German empire at the end of World War I, which opened a space for Ukrainian state-building and posed the immediate question of its defence. Second, during World War II, Ukrainian nationalists temporarily cooperated with Hitler Germany in their new attempt to build a Ukrainian national state and various Ukrainian military formations were set up to support this political aim by all means, be it by participation in mass crime. Third and most recently, Ukraine’s neighbour and former imperial ruling power, Russia, has tried by political and, since 2014, also by military means to interfere in Ukraine’s international political sovereignty. The response has been the effort to emancipate from Russia. In all these cases volunteers, civilians or soldiers stood up as self-proclaimed defenders of the nation and the state, formed ad hoc irregular military formations, and many of them were killed. Their activities have been shrouded in myths and legends, allegations of crimes and 25 On the cult of Stepan Bandera the contribution by Oksana Myshlovska in this volume; Rossolin´ski-Liebe, Grzegorz: Stepan Bandera.

A separate corps of about 2.500 Ukrainian soldiers called the Sich Riflemen served in 1914 in the Austro-Hungarian army, an important part of them entered the Ukrainian Galician Army in 1918–1919; in Russia’s army almost 300.000 Ukrainian soldiers formed “Ukrainized” army units during the year 1917.\n\n20\n\nGuido Hausmann\n\ndiverse political orientations. These chrystallized as informal political cults of the dead, which resurfaced in the public after 1991. Their critical reconsideration and contextual analysis is a timely task. Is the military-civic divide a useful historical and analytical category for the study of the political cult of the dead in Ukraine? The state was often considered as the “other”, the nation seen as still in formation. The hypothesis here is that in nations with disrupted, non-continuous state-building the political cult of the dead is more often based on functional equivalents of fallen soldiers, such as student volunteers or self-defence units, perceived as acting in the name of the nation. Historical research on the modern political cult of the dead has largely focused on World War I, when nationalism was in full swing in European societies and “the encounter with mass death took on a new dimension”.29 The American historian of World War I. Tammy M. Proctor has recently argued that “the years between 1914 and 1918 witnessed the invention of the modern “civilian” (and) the first mentions of the “home front””.30 “The “home front”, in fact, served as a vital complement to the “battle front”, and as an important ingredient in governmental propaganda machines.”31 George L. Mosse has pointed to the importance of volunteers, to the dreams of many young men to go to war to prove themselves, to processes of male bonding and loyalty.32 He argues that in Germany during World War II “public interest has shifted from the military to the civilian population – because of a war, in which the civilian population suffered to the same extent as the soldiers on the front.”33 For Ukraine too, the public commemoration of civil dead as a result of World War I and II, of revolution and civil war, of famines and political terror during Stalin’s rule over Ukraine and of the Holocaust is of immense importance since 1991 and is reflected in a number of publications. This volume nevertheless focuses on the political cult of the military dead, aiming at exploring its political significance in historical and present-day Ukraine. The volume reflects on the three features sketched out above with an emphasis on regional aspects, which have recently received more attention in scholarship on Ukraine34 and on gender, which so far has been rather rarely explored in studies on the political cult of the dead. The next subchapter summarizes the preliminary results of the volume and will address these features.\n\n29 30 31 32 33 34\n\nMosse, Fallen Soldiers, p. 3.

An Introduction\n\n3.\n\n21\n\nPreliminary results\n\nTen of the twelve contributions of the volume present case studies on the political cult of the dead from various parts and historical periods of Ukraine. The other two writings address related phenomena in the neighbouring Poland and Russia, which had an impact on or intersect with the manifestations of the cult in Ukraine. The articles are arranged in a temporal-systematic order. The volume does not pretend to offer a full picture. On the contrary, the authors stress local and regional specificities and their aim is to animate the reader to explore similar manifestations in other places of Ukraine in a comparative, trans-local or transregional perspective, to make the local case reflect national dimensions, or to open a transnational window on their subjects. Most contributions are based on a long-term engagement with their themes (also in the form of a doctoral dissertation), which has resulted in a number of recently published monographs.35 The first two contributions are related to the theme of Ukrainian national mobilization and state-building at the end of World War I: the Kyivan historian Andrii Liubarets shows the ideological instrumentalization (either as a tragic event or as a heroic struggle and victory) of the allegedly three hundred killed defenders of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in 1918 against the Bolshevik Red Guards, in various Ukrainian commemorative practices throughout the 20th– 21st centuries; the Warsaw historian Jagoda Wierzejska explores the Polish-Ukrainian war in Western Ukraine in 1918 in her analysis of the cult of the Lviv Eaglets in interwar Poland. The following eight contributions are related to the interwar period and to World War II and investigate very different cults of the dead in the postwar period, and also in independent Ukraine after 1991. Iryna Sklokina from Lviv investigates burial sites and monuments of the dead soldiers of World War II as public places in postwar Soviet Ukraine; Olena Petrenko from Bochum explores the heroic cult of Ukrainian nationalists from the 1920s to the 1950s, in particular of female nationalists; Kateryna Kobchenko from Kyiv an35 Bürger, Philipp: Geschichte im Dienst für das Vaterland: Traditionen und Ziele der russländischen Geschichtspolitik seit 2000.

His contribution serves also as a summary to this volume. The contributions testify to the high diversity of previous and new or recent political cults of the dead in Ukraine since 1991. The cults express the Ukrainian nation and state very differently in their material forms of representations, their political meanings and their spatial configurations. Cults emerge or resurface, coexist, overlap or counteract, show a remarkable longevity or undergo sudden changes and twists. At times clear symbolic meanings are expressed, at other times they remain rather obscure. The state is an important actor but by far not the only and decisive one in them, as it was the case during and after the Orange Revolution, the Euromaidan and the Russian-Ukrainian war. Symbols of the integration of state and nation are high on demand. Neither the experiences of World War I, nor those of World War II integrated the nation culturally and politically. On the contrary, they had a divisive effect. State independence, the Euromaidan of 2013–14 and the emerging cult of the Heavenly Hundred of the Euromaidan might have a contrary effect, although signs of reintegration have been not very strong so far. The emerging cult of the Heavenly Hundred exemplifies too a general trend of individualization of commemoration, but also the rising importance of religious symbolism. The state is often considered as the “other”, the nation is cast as in an unfinished process of formation. Once more it is important to stress the importance of the cults on volunteers as functional equivalents of fallen soldiers, perceived to act in the name of the nation.\n\nThe Political Cult of the Dead in Ukraine. An Introduction\n\n23\n\nIn his study on the Kruty hero cult since 1918, Andrii Liubarets shows three overlapping spatial dimensions of cult formation: the regional dimension is addressed by linking the actual battle in the northern region of Chernihiv with the capital Kyiv and pointing to the rising importance of the Chernihiv region as the central site of the commemoration of the battle. The national dimension emerges not only by showing the centrality of Kyiv as a memorial site for the battle, but also by showing how the latter was integrated into a series of past battles from Ukrainian history, that is, in a larger national narrative. The European dimension is articulated by referring to the continuous comparison of the Kruty fighters since 1918 with the 300 fallen Spartans at Thermopylae, a widespread symbolic reference at the time.36 In comparison, the cult of the Polish Lviv Eaglets, which Jagoda Wierzejska discusses in her study, manifested itself in interwar Poland as an independent state. The cult yielded more extended commemorative practices and found expression in memorials and ritualized practices. Here too the regional, national and European dimensions of the phenomenon are closely intertwined. Tombs of the Unknown Soldier were a postWorld War I invention, whose originals were erected in Britain and France in 1920. The cult evoked the symbolic integration of the Polish nation, but it split the Lviv population apart into national factions. Both cults were expressed in different media, they were cults of the youth and oriented towards the future, and one might think about the Kruty cult as an emerging cult of the Unknown Soldier in Ukraine in 1918. In Ukraine diverse meanings and forms and a wave of commemorations across the country after 1991 have been typical features of the cult of soldiers fallen in World War II. Iryna Sklokina explains in her article the neglect of the burial sites of dead soldiers and the mostly plain memorials in post-war Soviet Ukraine. She does so by showing the limited resources of the Soviet state to maintain these sites and create new ones. Burial sites and memorials were not only holy or sacred places, but rather had a function in state agitation and propaganda, thus as a source of political legitimacy. This was considered more important in Western Ukraine, a part of the Soviet Union only after 1945, than in Eastern Ukraine. She stresses the general Soviet context but also the role of the localities and of individual memorial activists vis-à-vis the state. On the contrary, Olena Petrenko shows a different tradition of commemoration by examining the death cult among Ukrainian nationalists in Western Ukraine from the 1920s to the 1950s. She integrates the sacrificial heroic death and the question of differences in female and male sacrificial death into the larger context of the political culture of commemoration among Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia since World 36 Albertz, Anuschka: Exemplarisches Heldentum.

As in many other parts of Europe, the cult of fallen soldiers retained here too in the interwar period strong religious and political overtones. It was elevated by nationalists to the status of a cult of sacrifice, which Petrenko traces from the 1920s to the war and post-war years. It functioned as a counter-commemoration to official Soviet political rituals. Kateryna Kobchenko investigates the transformations of the images of Soviet Ukrainian heroines from the 1930s to the wartime years, the post-war decades until present times and integrates them into the larger narratives of World War II. She shows the longevity of Soviet traditions in gender policy, as well as attitudes to female heroism and commemorative practices, which became quickly replaced by a national repertoire after 1991. Her case study also discusses the individualization of representations and commemorations in post-Soviet Ukraine. In her chapter on Odesa, Polina Barvinska likewise emphasizes the political meanings of the cult of the fallen soldier from Soviet times until today. Local traditions, embodied by the Memorial of the Unknown Sailor (1960), closely linked with Soviet times and traditions, remained strong until recently, but global (and European) processes of individualization, pluralization and desecularized commemoration has gained relevance in Odesa since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a process of nationalization has found more resonance in the city since 2014. Yuliya Yurchuk shows how after the silencing of the fallen UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army) and NKVD soldiers of the Hurby battle in Western Ukraine during Soviet times an active regional commemoration of the fallen UPA soldiers started after 1991 presenting them as fighters for the independence of Ukraine. It peaked during the time of the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010), when first reburials in a “Pantheon of Heroes” took place and the site acquired national significance. After the demise of Yushchenko it served as a national symbol directed against the “anti-national” policy of president Viktor Yanukovych. Yurchuk emphasizes the role of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate and of the strong religious undercurrents of this cult, most importantly the sacralisation of the fallen soldiers. Olesya Khromeychuk also explores local and regional commemorative practices in contemporary Ukraine, in her case the commemoration of the SS ‘Galicia’ Division. She has included in her article a critical examination of the “memory laws” of June 2015.37 In her opinion, the division was relegated by the Ukrainian state until recently to the margins of the heroic nationalist narrative, but local and regional memory37 See above all the law ‘On the condemnation of the communist and national socialist (Nazi) regimes, and prohibition of propaganda of their symbols’, 18 June 2015, available at https:// uinp.gov.ua/dokumenty/normatyvno-pravovi-akty-rozrobleni-v-instytuti/zakony [30 July 2020].\n\nThe Political Cult of the Dead in Ukraine. An Introduction\n\n25\n\nmakers of the far-right political parties have successfully mobilized its memory in various commemorative rituals. Ekaterina Makhotina and Philipp Bürger contribute to the analyses of the memory of post-war Soviet and independent Ukraine by considering the official monuments and memorials of the “Great Patriotic War” in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. They emphasize the inconsistencies of the state policy, the plurality of actors involved (the Red Army, monumental artists etc.), the various aesthetic forms (e. g. folklorization under Brezhnev) and a number of changes and twists. Most importantly, they observe a trend “from monumentalizing heroic soldiers to memorializing civilian victims” during the time of the Thaw to a recent dominance of a “victorious military tradition”.38 Three contributions focus on more recent developments from three different local or regional perspectives respectively. Oleksandra Gaidai interprets the fall of Lenin monuments across Ukraine after 2014 as a symbolic break with the Soviet past, viewing thus Lenin less as a historical figure. In her case study on the central Ukrainian city of Poltava she explores in more detail local memory actors or entrepreneurs and acknowledges the role of local authorities in a weak state, like Ukraine. Oksana Myshlovska investigates the political cult of Stepan Bandera as a foremost Western Ukrainian phenomenon in independent Ukraine, and symbol of Ukrainian independence. She analyzes the activities of local memory actors as local politicians or Greek Catholic priests in the creation of memorial spaces on Bandera at burial sites, in schools or museums. Most importantly she shows the new sacralization of the cult in Western Ukraine, which was a dominant tradition in the interwar period. Here the Bandera cult had a key symbolic and functional role, which was directed against the politics in Kyiv under president Yanukovych since 2010. Serhy Yekelchyk offers a broad interpretation of the cult of national heroes in tandem with the development of the modern Ukrainian nation from the mid 19th century onwards, which flows into his interpretation of the Heavenly Hundred of the Euromaidan and the commemorative practices upon them as civilian martyrs since 2014. His article explores the emerging memory landscape and public rituals in Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities as a representation of the new civil society in Ukraine, while the Heavenly Hundred figure as an important resource for present and future times. To summarize, the contributions of this volume stress not only the importance of Soviet and national traditions. They emphasize in particular the importance of the grassroot level, of local and regional actors or memory entrepreneurs, already in Soviet times, and even more so after 1991. This does not mean that politics on the highest level as the politics of memory of Yushchenko after 2004, or of Poroshenko after 2014 have been without relevance. But agency at the local level 38 See the contribution of Ekaterina Makhotina and Philipp Bürger in this volume.\n\n26\n\nGuido Hausmann\n\nwas in many ways decisive; local commemorative practices articulated not only local, but also national and international political agendas and they created local or regional spaces of commemoration. Without this dimension it is impossible to grasp the manifold and politically as well as socially differentiated dynamics in Ukraine and there is a risk to slip into superficial interpretations of the “two Ukraines.” Second, key to the narratives ascribed to most of the memorials analysed in this volume are myths of state origin and national defense.39 These myths revolve around the longevity, moral qualities and the unity of both the state and the nation, and are shaped by the revival of religious traditions and sacralized imaginings of the nation. The revival, flourishing and coexistence of different myths and their commemoration is typical for Ukraine after 1991 and in particular since 2003 / 2005. The toppling of Lenin monuments after 2014 as the symbolic end of the Soviet past is an essential part of this practise but they do not signify the end of leadership cults more generally. These practices signify less the unity of the country than demanding unity. Since the myths and commemorative practices construe the state and nation permanently in danger, in desperate need of defence, they are exclusionary in character and offer little perspective for a peaceful future with Ukraine’s neighbours, in particular Russia. Volunteers and irregular military formations as self-proclaimed defenders of the nation in the weak or non-existing state were particularly important figures in the political cult of the dead in Ukraine. They have been so far marginalized in the literature on the cult of the military dead, which focuses on cases in consolidated state frameworks. The coexistence of features of individualization of the cult and the contrary, potentially community-building heroization signify both adherence to and distanciation from more general Central and Western European trends. Third, the dynamics of commemorative practices has been intense, particularly in the last 15 years, which testifies to pluralist and fragmented processes of Ukrainian nation- and state-building. The Euromaidan, the Heavenly Hundred and the myth of the birth of a new nation may open a new chapter in Ukraine’s history. However, it remains open to what extent this new myth of origin and unity will have a broader popular appeal. To understand these dynamics, it is important to regard them also in their Central and Eastern European context, shaped both by postnational trends as well as new waves of nationalization. The conjunctures of national mobilization will depend largely on both the inner Ukrainian and the broader regional dynamics. The three summarizing features challenge key findings of Koselleck and Mosse on the political cult of the dead. 39 On the European context Berger, Stefan: “On the Role of Myths and History in the Construction of National Identity in Modern Europe”.

Following the proclamation of the UNR in 1917, Bolshevik formations had invaded large parts of the country, fighting against forces of the Central Council of Ukraine (Central Rada).2 Shortly after the Rada’s declaration of an independent Ukraine on January 22nd, 1918, a pro-Bolshevik rebellion (also referred to as the “January rebellion”) was launched in the Arsenal Factory of Kyiv on January 29, tying down the UNR’s sparse forces until the beginning of February. On an international scale, in January of 1918, the Central Rada was in negotiations with the Central Powers concerning the bestowal of protectorate status for Ukraine by Imperial Germany with a Ukrainian delegation having travelled to Brest-Litovsk to agree conditions which would ultimately be reflected in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of March of that year. Detachments of inexperienced UNR soldiers (mostly cadets and students) were sent to the Kruty railway station to engage the Bolshevik Army approaching Kyiv. At least in accordance with the contemporary Ukrainian historiography, they successfully halted the advance of the Red Army, buying the Ukrainian delegation at Brest-Litovsk much needed time for negotiations.3\n\n1 Tynchenko, Yaroslav (1996): Persha ukrainsko-bilshovytska viina (hruden 1917 – berezen 1918).

Oxford. 3 Tynchenko (1996).\n\n30\n\nAndrii Liubarets\n\nSuch factors as the superiority of Bolshevik forces (up to 6,000 Red Army soldiers under the command of Mikhail Muraviov against 500–600 UNR combatants), the quality and experience of the forces involved (at least 20 % of the UNR’s troops were university students with no military experience, epitomized by the 116-strong Student Company), the large losses incurred by Ukrainian forces (near 50 % were killed or missing in action), but also the undeniable strategic success of the battle (the Red Army suspended its march towards Kyiv for four days) turned considerable public attention to the event and gradually transformed it into a Ukrainian site of memory. The Kruty heroes’ cult is one of the most long-standing examples of the “cult of dead” in Ukrainian history, because its commemoration began in 1918. However, the battle itself is not a fundamental event for the Ukrainian historical narrative. Its commemoration has never been as pronounced as that of the Holodomor or Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). This is why memory of the battle has never determined state memory politics or exerted considerable influence upon political discussions. However, Kruty commemorations were and remain influential enough to reflect contemporary political and cultural contexts. The narrative a group of young people sacrificing themselves on the field of battle is widespread in European national historiographies of the 19th and 20th centuries. Lore surrounding the Battle of Kruty shares many commonalities with that pertaining to the German Battle of Langemarck during the First World War.4 National historical narratives use such events to create national martyrs, which seek to legitimize the nation-state, often using Christian imagery. Furthermore, the case of military defeat also aids in national narrative formation. For instance, the Battle of Kosovo or the fall of the Masada Fortress have turned into important elements of Serbian and Israeli national mythology, respectively. There does not exist a large body of research on the memory or commemoration of the Battle of Kruty, however, some studies do examine various aspects of the event. In her article about the battle’s historiography, Olena Boiko briefly wrote about the main factors that determined public attention to Kruty throughout the 20th century.5 Valerii Soldatenko researched commemorations of the battle which occurred in its immediate aftermath, in 1918.6 Serhiy Butko, a\n\n4 Mosse, George (1990): Fallen Soldiers: Reshaping the Memory of the World Wars.

According to him, the most active in this regard was President Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010), who, in spite of his attempts to mobilize patriotic sentiments using the event, was not successful.9 Olesia Khromeychuk analyzed recent commemorations of Kruty in the context of the militarization of Ukrainian society.10 Despite the not-insignificant amount of attention the memory and commemorations of the Battle of Kruty have received, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the history of these has yet to be presented. The goal of this contribution is to provide precisely that and to trace the history of non-academic appeals to the battle in Ukraine, exploring how its commemoration has evolved. In so doing, the dynamics of Ukrainian memory politics throughout the 20th and early 21st century history will be uncovered, illustrating the essential heterogeneity of Ukrainian historical narratives. This text investigates what sort of image the battle has been provided with by officials, politicians, and intellectuals, and what political and cultural factors have shaped its commemorative culture. In this regard, this analysis will primarily focus on political actors, since the instrumentalization of historical events is, in and of itself, a rather political process.\n\n2.\n\nCommemorations of Kruty since 1918: Formation of the cult\n\nThe commemoration of the Battle of Kruty began immediately following its conclusion. In the beginning of March 1918, an Imperial German army entered Kyiv and restored the Central Rada government, which formed a committee on 7 Butko, Serhiy (2008): “Heroizm krutian yak pryklad dlia chleniv OUN ta voiakiv UPA”, in: Kruty.

On March 9th, the Central Rada’s head and important nationalist leader of the era, Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1866–1934), suggested a ceremonial reburial of the fallen fighters at Askold’s Grave, a historic park in the center of Kyiv.12 On March 19th, the ceremonial reburial of 18 fallen Kruty soldiers (those whose corpses were recovered and identified) was organized. This event had a powerful commemorative component. The reburial ceremony was attended by students, relatives of the dead, politicians, soldiers, officers, clergy, and intellectuals. The procession began near the Central Station (today’s Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi Railway Station) winding its way to Askold’s Grave through the city’s center.13 When the mourners passed the building of the Central Rada (at present, the Teacher’s House on Volodymyrska Street, 57), imperial Russian symbols were symbolically removed from it. Hrushevsky commented: “Right at this moment, when their coffins are being carried near the Central Rada – the place where Ukrainian statehood has been tempered for a year, the Russian eagle, the infamous sign of Russian domination over Ukraine, the symbol of more than 260 years of captivity, has been removed from its pediment. It seems that the possibility to demolish it hasn‘t been made freely, and couldn’t be done without sacrifice, but rather must be bought with blood. And the blood was spilt by these young heroes, whom we now are seeing off.”14\n\nHrushevsky used the opportunity to contrast the fallen Kruty soldiers with other combatants who had declared their neutrality in the civil war: “It is a great honor to die this way, not being a deserter or a neutral who tries to slip into a new realm of Ukrainian freedom as a passenger without a ticket.”15 According to the memoirs of witnesses, during the ceremony, a teacher of the Second Ukrainian\n\n11 ‘Nakaz № 49 po viiskovomu ministerstvu UNR pro utvorennia komisii dlia ziasuvannia obstavyn boiu pid Krutamy (1918)’ [‘Order N 29 of the Military Ministry of the Ukrainian People’s Republic on the formation of the investigative commission to examine the circumstances of the Battle of Kruty, 1918’], in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 92. 12 ‘Pro rishennia Maloi Rady perepokhovaty tykh, shcho zahynuly pid Krutamy v Kyievi’ [‘On the decision of the Small Council to rebury those who perished near Kruty’], in: Nova Rada 3 (8 March 1918), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 95. 13 ‘Pohorony studentov i gimnazistov-sechevikov’ [‘The funeral of the students and high school students-participants of Sich detachments’], Kievskaia mysl 29 (18 March 1918), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 104. 14 ‘Promova M.

To this day, the term “Ukrainian Thermopylae” remains in use as an epithet for the Battle of Kruty, and allusions to it continue to pervade public discourse.17 In 1918, the young poet Pavlo Tychyna (who would go on to become one of the most wellknown Ukrainian literary figures of the 20th century) described the funeral of the Kruty fighters in his poem “In memory of the 300”. The poem turned into one of the key elements of the Kruty heroes’ commemoration. Finally, fundraising for a monument to the fallen soldiers began almost immediately in late March 1918.18 Commemorations of the Kruty soldiers continued following the end of the Central Rada’s rule in April 1918. During the ensuing Hetmanate period of Pavlo Skoropadsky (April–December 1918), memorial services for the fallen Kruty soldiers19 and fundraising for a monument continued.20 The Kruty reburial in March of that year had sparked commemorations for all soldiers who fell either defending, or in pursuit of Ukrainian independence. The Central Rada, specifically in the person of Hrushevsky, played a key role in cementing these traditions. For this reason, Hrushevsky could, to a certain extent, be designated as the originator of the Kruty heroes’ cult. It is important to note that in the immediate aftermath of the battle, the press in Kyiv had published critical articles accusing the government of complicity in the soldiers’ deaths. For instance, on March 16th, 1918, the “New Rada” newspaper published an article from the oppositional politician Serhiy Shemet which stated: “In Kruty, the young Ukrainian nation’s pride died … The guilt for this rests on this system of nonsense, our government, which after half a year of brilliant social lawmaking and administration appeared to be deserted by the people and army…and decided to protect itself with a few hundred school youth.”21 The initiator of fundraising for the monument, Serhiy Kolomiytsev, likewise accused the government of having a hand in the deaths of the soldiers at Kruty: “Honor and glory to the young heroes and eternal shame to those who had 16 Vasylkivskyi, L.: ‘Rozdumy na skhyli zhyttia’ [‘Reflections at the end of life’] [1969], in: Heroika trahedii Krut, Kyiv 2008, p. 171. 17 Trofimova, Natalia: ‘Heroi Krut: spravzhni ta samoproholosheni’ [‘Heroes of Kruty: real and self-proclaimed’], in: Den. 31 January 2006, https://day.kyiv.ua/uk/article/podrobici/geroyi -krut-spravzhni-ta-samoprogolosheni [18. 12. 2019]. 18 ‘Na pamiatnyk zhertvam u Krutakh’ [‘For the monument to the victims of Kruty’], in: Nova Rada 37 (20 March 1918), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 112. 19 ‘Oholoshennia pro panakhydu na Askoldovii mohyli’ [‘Announcement of the religious service at Askold’s Grave’], Nova Rada 74 (12 May 1918), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 134. 20 ‘Mystetstvo v spravi buduvannia pamiatnyka bortsiam za nezalezhnist Ukrainy’ [‘The art of building a monument to the fighters for Ukraine’s independence’], Nova Rada 85 (26 May 1918), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 137. 21 S.

Equally, the Ukrainian media also played an important role in establishing the battle’s commemorative tradition. Newspapers such as Nova Rada, Kievskaia Mysl, and Narodna Sprava actively informed their readers about reburials, supported commemorations, and published further articles about the battle. In this way, the press in Kyiv also shaped the early commemorations and representation of the battle. A number of researchers have noted how the end of the First World War was marked by an increase of media influence on the formation of commemorative and memory cultures as a part of the broader process of nation-building.23 Memory politics relating to the battle of Kruty confirm this assumption. During the Soviet period, the cult of the Kruty heroes persisted among the Ukrainian diaspora. Ukrainian educational organizations and community centers in Eastern Europe and North America commemorated the battle’s anniversaries as an important stage in the Ukrainian struggle for independence.24 In the liberal political tradition, the Ukrainian diaspora continued to commemorate the battle as both a tragic event, and one showcasing honorable self-sacrifice in the name of Ukraine. This can be seen in publications from the émigré journal Hurtuimosia published by UNR Army veterans in Prague. The drawing in illustration 1 was made by the co-editor of Hurtuimosia and UNR veteran (as well as writer, painter, and art historian) Mykola Bytynsky. It represents the Battle of Kruty through corpses, languishing desperately in the snowdrifts, an emblematic depiction of Kyiv (the domes of St. Sofia and the monument to Bohdan Khmelnytsky), and a symbolic figure which carries laurels over the dead with one hand, and a sword in the other.\n\n3.\n\nCommemorations of Kruty in the 1930s: Rightist discourse\n\nKruty commemorations were “revived” by western-Ukrainian interwar nationalist ideologists in the 1930s. During this period, newspapers sympathetic to the OUN, as well as to other nationalist and rightist organizations began publishing articles about the battle. Concurrently, many works of art devoted to Kruty were created, such as poems by Oleksa Stefanovych, Borys Lysyansky, Volodymyr 22 Ibid. 23 Andrews, Maggie: ‘Commemorating the First World War in Britain: A Cultural Legacy of Media Remembrance’, in: Journal of War & Culture Studies 2019/12(3), p. 1–19. 24 Boiko 2008.\n\nCommemorating the Battle of Kruty from 1918 to the Present\n\n35\n\nIllustration 1.

Courtesy of the Vasyl Stefanyk National Scientific Library in Lviv.\n\nJaniv, Sviatoslav Hordynsky, novels by Bohdan-Ihor Antonych, Yevhen Malaniuk, Oksana Liaturynska, as well as various paintings, prints, and posters.25 Accordingly, references to Kruty grew more widespread and diverse in the public sphere. The strategy for representing the battle anew is best surmised from some contemporary press quotations. An article in the “Ukrainian Voice. Agency of Nationalist Thought” newspaper characterized Kruty in 1930 as “a place, where a hot gust of passionate young souls stubbornly set the building of our statehood on the right path: a hard, sacrificial fight against the enemy.” The pervading political situation of the time of the battle was termed that of “hrushivshchyna”, of “fumes of different kinds of socialism and pacifism”, with the enemy – the “Moscow-Bolshevik horde.”26 These quotations demonstrate the rise of a completely new discourse on Kruty, which rejected its casting as a tragedy, and the fallen soldiers as victims, shifting instead to a more festive tone. The brochure “Kruty. The Birth of a New Ukrainian” by the poet, writer, and OUN member Yevhen Malaniuk (1897–1968) fiercely condemned the “psychic tone of the national memory” and the emphasis upon defeat and melancholic emotions. It also criticized one of the battle’s participant’s memoirs, who referred to the clash as a “tactical mistake” and a “misunderstanding”. Instead, for Malaniuk, “Kruty – provides the first insight 25 Ibid. 26 ‘Krivavyi khrest. V 12-tu richnytsiu boiu pid Krutamy’ [Bloody Cross. On the 12th Anniversary of the Battle near Kruty), Ukrainskyi holos: Orhan natsionalistychnoi dumky (Peremyshl) (2 February 1930), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 342–343.\n\n36\n\nAndrii Liubarets\n\nthat power – is struggle and state – blood and iron”, with the fallen soldiers representing for him a new type of personality with a distinct Ukrainian national identity, free from the ages-long imperial loyalties.27 The drawing by the OUN member and graphic artist Mykhailo Mykhalevych on the cover of the accompanying book is a good representation of this new trend in the memory politics surrounding the battle (illustration 2). Soldiers are symbolized by the image of the Archangel Michael, the holy protector of Kyiv, brandishing a sword and trident (the Ukrainian state emblem). The tragic aspect of the battle is barely alluded to, apart from the half-broken arrowwood branch.\n\nIllustration 2. Mykhailo Mykhalevych. Cover of the book by Yevhen Malaniuk, “Kruty: narodyny novoho ukraintsia”, 1941. Courtesy of the Vasyl Stefanyk National Scientific Library in Lviv.\n\nThe memory of Kruty was used to advance a nationalist vision of state-building, namely the superiority of action over thought, and of struggle over pacifism (using the terms of the prominent Ukrainian nationalist ideologist Dmytro Dontsov; 1883–1973). This approach also criticized the character of the 1917– 1921 Ukrainian national liberation movement, which became an important component of Dontsov’s ideology of “integral nationalism”.28 Using this memory 27 Malaniuk, Yevhen: Kruty.

At this time, the Kruty heroes’ cult spread among western Ukrainian youth and student organizations. The Ukrainian youth scout organization “Plast”, ideologically close to the OUN, used the Kruty heroes’ cult for their educational purposes. For instance, a 1929 Chasopys ukrainiskoho Plastu (“The magazine of the Ukrainian Plast”) issue printed the following poem in honor of the battle’s anniversary: “We created Thermopylae. You have to create Plataea [victorious battle for the Greeks during the Second Persian Invasion of Greece]. When the time will come, bring life and happiness to sacrifice.”29 On the 13th anniversary of the battle in 1931, the second conference of Lviv students decided to commemorate the event as a Ukrainian student holiday, announcing one day of fasting and the collection of donations to support political prisoners being held by the Polish authorities.30 In 1937, the Lviv youth magazine, Doroha, announced a competition for the best anthem (lyrics and melody) “in honor of the Kruty heroes.” The winning anthem would be widely circulated, mainly among rural choirs.31 The tradition of commemorating the battle continued during World War II in the OUN-controlled UPA, with the battle’s anniversary celebrated amongst its units. The “history” section of the book “The program of educational classes, reports, and lectures in the UPA” included the topic “Kruty. The heroism of Ukrainian youth” and in 1944, a UPA division was named after the battle.32 During the period of Nazi occupation, the Ukrainian press also made appeals to the battle. The Kharkiv-based Nova Ukraina (“New Ukraine”) newspaper informed its readers on the anniversary of the clash that Kruty has been a “legendary date in the history of the Ukrainian people‘s struggle against the Bolshevik threat” (1943). The article noted, “today in the Ukrainian lands, liberated from Bolsheviks, we again celebrate the unforgettable anniversary of the Battle of Kruty.”33 Thus even Nazi-supported, anticommunist propaganda appealed to the battle’s memory. Following the Second World War, commemorations of the battle were held only among the Ukrainian diaspora. Communities in western Europe and North America started to produce historical research on the battle. One of the first such books was “Kruty”, published 1958 in Munich by Danylo Chaikovsky (under the 29 ‘V richnytsiu borotby pid Krutamy’ [‘On the anniversary of the Fight near Kruty’], Molode zhyttia: Chasopys ukrainskoho plastu (Lviv) (15 March 1929), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 338. 30 Boiko 2008. 31 ‘Konkurs na Krutianskyi himn’ [‘Competition for the Kruty hymn’], Doroha (Lviv) (December 1937), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 438. 32 Serhiy Butko 2008. 33 V.

These are easily explained both by the atmosphere of the Cold War and by the personal experience of their authors, who were mostly opponents and/or victims of the Soviet regime. In 1958, the Ukrainian journalist Volodymyr Janiv published the article, “The Battle of Kruty. The Free World’s First Resistance to Communism” in Brussels. In his opinion the “Battle of Kruty symbolize[d] the communist ‘civilization’ that threatens to engulf the free world of today” urging for “Kruty [to] be a warning to the Free World!”35 In 1978, an article “The Battle of Kruty – Charging Moscow” was published in the Montreal Plast magazine, stating: “The Ukrainian defenders of Kruty were the first to reveal the imperialist face of the so-called new Russia.”36 Another article from the Ukrainian diaspora, published in 1983 in Paris, pointed out similarly: “Standing over three hundred bodies of heroes, leading its red imperialist campaign, Moscow celebrated its first victory by force over the free world.”37 Members of the diaspora tried to attach global significance to the battle, and use its commemorations to attract attention to the Ukrainian struggle against the Soviet Union. In summary, during the interwar period two different discourses on the Battle of Kruty arose; the first was shaped by the funeral procession of 1918, and depicted Kruty as a tragic hour in Ukrainian history, with its fighters portrayed as Ukrainian martyrs; the second discourse came about later, and was shaped by integral nationalism in western Ukraine during the 1930s. This discourse adopted more festive tones, interpreting Kruty as a victory, and fiercely criticizing the Ukrainian (democratic and socialist) politicians of 1917–1921. Both memory strands served as models for commemorations of the Kruty heroes in Ukraine after 1991.\n\n34 Zbarazky, Semen: Kruty: u 40-richchia 29 sichnia [Kruty: On the 40th anniversary of the 29th of January].

In 1990, a group of writers compared the ‘Revolution on Granite’ participants, largely students engaged in a hunger strike in opposition to the Communist Party’s dominance in the recently elected parliament (the Verkhovna Rada), with the Kruty fighters in their appeal to the Rada: “Again, as in 1918 near Kruty, the youth of our nation goes to the slaughter in the name of an independent, sovereign Ukraine.”38 In the same year, with the financial support of the Narodnyi Rukh Ukrainy (the People’s Movement of Ukraine), the most prominent Ukrainian national-democratic opposition movement of the period, wooden crosses in memory of the Kruty heroes were erected at Askold’s Grave in Kyiv and near the Kruty railway station. A number of researchers and poets appealed throughout the 1990s to the battle, but only a handful of public initiatives were organized to commemorate it. The first official, state-level appeal to Kruty in independent Ukraine was held only in 2003 to mark the battle’s 85th anniversary, when then-President Leonid Kuchma (1994–2004) passed the decree “On the commemoration of the Kruty heroes.” The decree called for the organization of exhibitions, thematic evenings, and wide media coverage of these events.39 Nevertheless, systematic official memory politics related to Kruty are mostly associated with the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010) who played a crucial role in their intensification and the sparking of public debates on historical topics in the mid-2000s. He also raised the popularity of the Kruty commemorations to a new level and made it a significant part of the state’s official memory politics, with public interest in the battle reaching a peak during his presidency. In 2005, Yushchenko signed off on the “In memory of the Kruty heroes” project, which entailed a memorial and museum complex. The complex, completed in 2008, is located near the battlefield’s vicinity close to the village of Pamiatne in the Chernihiv region. It consists of a 10-meter high red column (see illustration 3), representing the column of Kyiv University, on a 7-meter high embankment (emphasizing the popular motif of student participation in the battle), 7 stylized railcars (housing the Museum of Kruty Heroes, and featuring historical documents, clothing, and personal items of the fighters), an open 38 ‘Vymohy studentiv – vymohy narodu’ [‘Demands of the students – demands of the people’], in: Literaturna Ukraina 11 October 1990/41, p. 1. 39 Decree of the President of Ukraine № 12 (2003), http://uazakon.com/documents/date_75/pg _iywjwv.htm [18. 12. 2019]; Hrytsenko 2017.\n\n40\n\nAndrii Liubarets\n\nplatform, a chapel, a lake in the shape of a cross and a symbolic grave-mound with a cross on it. Most of the symbols in the memorial complex showcase burial and mourning motifs, which evoke to the tragic character of the event and the martyred image of the fallen.\n\nIllustration 3.

One of them portrays a cross with the names of different battles from Ukrainian history, accompanied by a quote from the Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych: “We were thrown on a battlefield, soberly, without regrets, just like a card.” In addition, there is a stone plaque with the text: “Stranger! Stop and bow to the heroes who have died for Ukrainian freedom”,40 an allusion to the famous Greek “Epitaph of Simonides”. In this way, the popular comparison of Kruty with Thermopylae is perpetuated and incorporated in the complex. Beginning in 2006, annual commemorative ceremonies including rallies and requiems were held at the site. The president, officials, as well as political and cultural figures are frequent attendees, and continue to speak at such events. The second, less popular site to commemorate the Kruty heroes, is located in Kyiv at Askold’s Grave, where some of the Kruty fighters were reburied in 1918. In 1934, the cemetery was destroyed during the construction of a landscape park at the site. The construction of a monument dedicated to Kruty at Askold’s Grave was initiated by presidential decrees from Leonid Kuchma in 200341 and Viktor Yushchenko in 2007,42 however, it was never completed.

It included the script to an ideologically-loaded feature film about the battle written by the Ukrainian film director and writer Vasyl Portiak and Yaroslav Havryliuk, an actor and head of the “Heroes of Kruty” association. In the final scene of this film, the Bolsheviks give the imprisoned protagonist, a UNR soldier who was captured at Kruty, a chance to survive by joining the Red Army, but he refuses to do so and is killed.43 The film, however, has neither been produced, nor shot. In 2009, Viktor Yushchenko voiced his support for an initiative to transfer the Ukrainian state holiday – the Day of the Defender of the Fatherland, celebrated in Ukraine since 1999 on February 23rd, to January 30th, the anniversary of the Battle of Kruty. According to him, “the Day of Kruty‘s deed is our real national Day of the Defender of the Fatherland.”44 Obviously he aimed at replacing an old 43 Portiak, Vasyl / Havryliuk, Yaroslav: ‘Kinostsenarii’ [‘Film scenarios’], in: Havryliuk 2008, p. 754–815. 44 ‘Yushchenko proponuye perenesty Den zakhysnyka vitchyzny na 29 sichnya’ [‘Yushchenko proposes to transfer the Defender of the Fatherland day to January 29th’], in: TSN. 29 January 2009, http://tsn.ua/ukrayina/yushchenko-proponuye-perenesti-den-zahisnika-vitchizni-na29-sichnya.html [18. 12. 2019].\n\n42\n\nAndrii Liubarets\n\nSoviet holiday with a date associated with Ukrainian national history. In 2010, then-president Yushchenko issued a decree “On honoring participants of the struggle for independence of Ukraine in the twentieth century” which officially recognized the combatants of the Central Rada’s armed formations as participants in the struggle for Ukrainian independence, elevating the status of the soldiers at Kruty.45 For a better understanding of the specifics of official memory politics in regards to Kruty, a closer examination of presidential speeches referencing the battle is helpful. In a foreword to the collection of documents about the battle from 2009, then-President Yushchenko noted: “The heroism and self-sacrifice of these young men serve as guides to all future generations. The Kruty heroes’ star shined to thousands and thousands of participants of the national liberation struggle of the Ukrainian people … After all, its flame brightly lit streets throughout the country during the Orange Revolution, when people stood against falsehood.”46 Here, Yushchenko connected his own era to the Kruty commemorations, legitimizing his presidential power by linking the Orange Revolution of 2004, which had paved the way for him to become the President of Ukraine, with the Battle of Kruty. On the battle’s anniversary in 2011, following the end of his presidential term, Yushchenko remarked: “Ukrainian history always consists of the pages of the struggle for its independence … there is just one history and it is the national one. And from this perspective, Kruty is our historical genetic code.”47 This quotation is quite typical for the former president‘s vision of history, namely an exclusive one, with the struggle for independence as its highest goal. In brief, official contemporary discourses on Kruty were of the post-independence era up until roughly 2010 remained inspired by commemorations which began in 1918, emphasizing the martyrdom of the fighters, the burial motif, and the idea that the combatants believed in the struggle for independence. Nevertheless, commemorations of the Holodomor, the most powerful official memory topic of the period, have exerted a substantial influence on how the much-earlier Battle of Kruty is commemorated as well. For instance, the prevalence of rallyrequiems as the main commemorative form, coupled with an abundance of burial symbolism all coincide with how Holodomor is commemorated. Compared to Yushchenko, his successor as the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych (2010–2014) was not interested in active memory politics, criticizing his predecessor for his “nationalist” policy. As a result, from 2010 until 2014, 45 Decree of the President of Ukraine № 75 (2010), http://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/75/2 010 [18. 12. 2019]. 46 Yushchenko, Viktor: ‘Dorohi chytachi!’ (2009), in: Havryliuk (ed.) 2008, p. 7. 47 Yushchenko, Viktor: ‘Skazhy, khto tvii batko.

New editions of school history textbooks for the 5th grade in 2011 provoked a scandal, because they did not mention the battle at all. According to Volodymyr Mysan, the author of a previous textbook, the new textbook sought to promote a nonaggressive image of Russia.48 The political opposition used the refusal of Yanukovych to commemorate Kruty as a weapon against him, flocking en masse to commemorative ceremonies for the battle from 2011 onwards. That first year, the traditional rally-requiem at the memorial complex was attended by opposition politicians, with the battle’s memory gaining increased importance in Ukraine’s memory struggles. For instance, Arseniy Yatseniuk, at the time the leader of one of the opposition parties, compared the situation of the political opposition with that of the Kruty fighters saying: “To throw students against the regular troops – it is just like today when unprepared democratic forces are fighting with the prototype of the Communist Party, the Party of Regions.”49 The same year, the opposition politician Viacheslav Kyrylenko accused the ruling Ukrainian politicians of Ukrainophobia in a public speech at the memorial complex, singling out the Minister of Education Dmytro Tabachnyk, who had overseen the exclusion of Kruty from scho"
