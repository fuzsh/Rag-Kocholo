        "text": "Estimates of killed and injured during the conflict in Ukraine, 2014–present\n\nCasualties in the Russo-Ukrainian War include six deaths during the 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, 14,200–14,400 military and civilian deaths during the War in Donbas, and up to 500,000 estimated casualties during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe War in Donbas' deadliest phase occurred before the Minsk agreements, aimed at ceasefire and settlement. Despite varied reports on Ukrainian military casualties due to underreporting, official figures eventually tallied, indicating significant military and civilian casualties on both sides. The war also saw a substantial number of missing and captured individuals, with efforts to exchange prisoners between conflicting parties. Foreign fighters and civilian casualties added to the war's complexity, with international involvement and impacts extending beyond the immediate conflict zones.\n\nThe subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine further escalated casualties and destruction. Conflicting reports from Russian and Ukrainian sources indicated high military and civilian casualties, with significant discrepancies in reported numbers. Foreign involvement continued, with both foreign fighters and civilian deaths reported. Efforts to identify and repatriate the deceased, alongside the treatment of prisoners of war, highlighted the human cost of the ongoing conflict.\n\nRussian annexation of Crimea\n\nDuring the Russian annexation of Crimea from 23 February through 19 March 2014, six people were killed. The dead included three protesters,[1][2][3] two Ukrainian soldiers[4] and one Russian Cossack paramilitary.[5] On 10 August 2016, Russia accused the Special Forces of Ukraine of conducting a raid near the Crimean town of Armiansk which killed two Russian servicemen. The government of Ukraine dismissed the report as a provocation.[6] Ten people were forcibly disappeared between 2014 and 2016 and were still missing as of 2017.[7]\n\nWar in Donbas (before 2022 invasion)\n\nMain article: War in Donbas\n\nThe overall number of estimated deaths in the war in Donbas from 6 April 2014 to 31 December 2021 was 14,200–14,400. This included about 6,500 pro-Russian separatist fighters, 4,400 Ukrainian fighters, and 3,404 civilians.[8] This number includes non-combat military deaths, as well as deaths from mines and unexploded ordnance. The vast majority of the deaths took place in the first year of the war, when major combat took place before the Minsk agreements.\n\nTotal deaths\n\nBreakdown Fatalities Time period Source Total 14,200–14,400 killed 6 April 2014 – 31 December 2021 United Nations[8] Civilians 3,404 killed (306 foreign) 6 April 2014 – 31 December 2021 United Nations[8] Ukrainian forces\n\n(ZSU, NGU, SBGS\n\nand volunteer forces) 4,400 killed 6 April 2014 – 31 December 2021 United Nations[8] 4,647 killed[a] 6 April 2014 – 23 February 2022 Museum of Military History[9][10][11] 4,821 killed[a] 6 April 2014 – 23 February 2022 UALosses project[12] Pro-Russian forces\n\n(DPR and LPR forces) 6,500 killed 6 April 2014 – 31 December 2021 United Nations[8] 17 killed 1 January – 25 February 2022 DPR & LPR[13][14] Russian Armed Forces 400–500 killed[b] 6 April 2014 – 10 March 2015 US State Department[15]\n\nInitially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[16] as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[16][17][18][19] Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[16] Eventually, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[20] with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[9][10]\n\nAccording to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[21] Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[22]\n\nDeaths by regions\n\nThe following table does not include the 298 deaths from the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 or the deaths of Ukrainian servicemen, which are listed separately.\n\nRegion Fatalities Time period Source Donetsk region 2,420 civilians and DPR fighters killed[24] 6 April 2014 – 15 February 2015 OCHA Luhansk region 1,185 civilians and LPR fighters killed[c][24] 1 May 2014 – 15 February 2015 OCHA Donetsk region 4,374 civilians killed[28] 6 April 2014 – 18 February 2022 DPR Luhansk region 2,269 civilians killed[29] 6 April 2014 – 23 February 2022 LPR\n\nMissing and captured\n\nBy 15 May 2016, the Donetsk region's prosecutors reported 1,592 civilians had gone missing in government-controlled areas, of whom 208 had been located.[30] At the same time, a report by the United Nations stated 1,331–1,460 people were missing, including at least 378 soldiers and 216 civilians. 345 unidentified bodies, of mostly soldiers, were also confirmed to be held at morgues in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast or buried.[31] In all, as of late October, 774 people were missing according to the government,[32] including 271 soldiers.[33] By the end of December 2017, the number of confirmed missing on the Ukrainian side was 402,[34] including 123 soldiers.[35] The separatists also reported 433 missing on their side by mid-December 2016,[36] and 321 missing by mid-February 2022.[37]\n\nAs of mid-March 2015, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), 1,553 separatists had been released from captivity during prisoner exchanges between the two sides.[38] Subsequently, Ukraine released another 316 people by late February 2016, according to the DPR and other media reports,[39][40][41][42] while by September, 1,598 security forces members and 1,484 civilians had been released by the rebels.[43] 1,110 separatist fighters and supporters, including 743 civilians, were reportedly still being held by Ukrainian forces as of late March 2016, according to the DPR.[44] They updated the figure of separatist prisoners to 816, including 287–646 civilians, in December.[45][36] At the end of May 2015, the Ukrainian commander of Donetsk airport, Oleg Kuzminykh, who was captured during the battle for the complex, was released.[46]\n\nIn December 2017, a large prisoner exchange took place where the rebels released 73 out of 176 prisoners they were holding, while Ukraine released 306 out of 380 of their prisoners. Out of those that were released by Ukraine, 29 brought to the exchange point refused to go back to separatist-held territory, while 40 who were already previously released did not show up for the exchange. Meanwhile, out of those released by the rebels, 32 were soldiers. This brought the overall number of prisoners released by the rebels to 3,215.[34] Among those still held by the separatists, 74 were soldiers.[47] The number of released prisoners was updated to 3,224 in late June 2018,[48] while the number of those still held by the rebels was put at 113.[49] At the end of December 2019, a new prisoner exchange took place, with Ukraine releasing 124 separatist fighters and their supporters, while 76 prisoners, including 12 soldiers, were returned to Ukraine by the rebels. Another five or six prisoners released by the separatists decided to stay in rebel-controlled territories.[50][51][52]\n\nForeign fighters\n\nForeign volunteers have been involved in the conflict, fighting on both sides. The NGO Cargo 200 reported that they documented the deaths of 1,479 Russian citizens while fighting as part of the rebel forces.[53] The United States Department of State estimated 400–500 of these were regular Russian soldiers.[15] Two Kyrgyz and one Georgian have also been killed fighting on the separatist side.[54] Additionally, at least 262 foreign-born Ukrainian citizens or foreigners died on the Ukrainian side.[55] One of those killed was the former Chechen rebel commander Isa Munayev.[56]\n\nIn late August 2015, according to a reported leak by a Russian news site, Business Life (Delovaya Zhizn), 2,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine by 1 February 2015.[57][58]\n\nForeign civilians and journalists\n\nAt least 306 foreign civilians were killed in the war in Donbas prior to the 2022 invasion:\n\n298 passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17[59]\n\nItalian journalist Andrea Rocchelli and his Russian fixer and interpreter, activist Andrei Mironov[60][61]\n\nFour other civilian journalists and media workers from Russia: Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin, a correspondent and sound engineer respectively; Anatoly Klyan, a camera operator; and Andrey Stenin, a photojournalist[61]\n\nOne Russian civilian killed in the shelling of Donetsk, Russia[62]\n\nOne Lithuanian diplomat[63]\n\nLandmines and other explosive remnants\n\nAs a consequence of the conflict, large swaths of the Donbas region have become contaminated with landmines and other explosive remnants of war (ERW).[64] According to the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, in 2020 Ukraine was one of the countries most affected by ERW in the world, and had had nearly 1,200 casualties caused by mines or ERW since the beginning of the conflict in 2014.[65] A report by UNICEF released in December 2019 said that 172 children had been injured or killed due to landmines and other explosives.[66]\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\n\nMain article: Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nTotal casualties\n\nIn September 2022, Russia's Ministry of Defence confirmed that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed in combat.[67] It also claimed 61,207 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 49,368 wounded by this point.[68] In February 2024, the Ministry updated its claim of Ukrainian military casualties to 444,000 killed and wounded.[69] In addition, the DPR confirmed that by 22 December 2022, 4,163 of their servicemen had been killed and 17,329 wounded.[d] Subsequently, leaked US intelligence documents cited the Russian FSB that Russian forces suffered 110,000 casualties by 28 February 2023.[73]\n\nAccording to BBC News Russian and the Mediazona news website, out of 65,522 Russian soldiers and contractors whose deaths they had documented by 23 August 2024, 6 percent (3,950) were officers, while 7 percent (4,611) were Motorized Rifle Troops and 4.4 percent (2,873) were members of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV). In addition, 13.2 percent (8,637) of Russian soldiers whose deaths had been confirmed were people who were mobilized, while 19.5 percent (12,749) were convicts.[74] The BBC further stated that\n\nReal losses are obviously much higher than we can establish through open sources. Military specialists suggest our analysis of Russian cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries captures 55-70% of the true death figure.\n\nThus, the BBC stated that the actual death toll of Russian forces, counting only Russian servicemen and contractors (i.e. excluding DPR/LPR militia), was 87,140–110,900 by late July 2024.[75]\n\nWagner PMC chief Yevgeny Prigozhin confirmed that his organization had lost over 20,000 troops killed by May 25, 2023.[76] He went on to claim that overall, the Russian military had lost 120,000 dead in Ukraine by late June. He accused the Ministry of Defence of systematically downplaying Russian losses.[77]\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that more Russian soldiers died in the first year of the war in Ukraine than in all its other wars since World War II combined, an average 5,000 to 5,800 soldiers a month, vs 13,000 to 25,000 in Chechnya over 15 years and 14,000 to 16,000 in Afghanistan. Thus, the first year of the Ukraine war was 25 times deadlier than Chechnya and 35 times more so than Afghanistan.[78]\n\nMeduza, analyzing data on confirmed soldiers killed and data retrieved from the Russian probate registry, estimated 75,000 Russian soldiers were killed since the start of the invasion and by the end of 2023, a statistical estimate within a wide range of between 66,000 and 88,000 killed.[79] Subsequently, several months later, Meduza gave a new estimate of 64,000 soldiers killed in 2022 and 2023, based on excess deaths reported by Rosstat, including those in Crimea, but not other Ukrainian regions seized by Russia.[80] Using a similar analysis, but in addition using a statistical model of the ratio of total deaths to deaths confirmed by name, stratified by age group, and the Mediazona updated counts of named deaths, Meduza gave an updated estimate of total Russian deaths of 120,000 killed through to 30 June 2024.[81] Several days later, The Economist made its own calculation using the severely-wounded-to-killed ratio from leaked documents by the United States Department of Defense, giving an estimate of between 462,000 and 728,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the conflict.[82]\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine confirmed it had 10,000 killed and 30,000 wounded by the start of June 2022,[83] while 7,200 troops were missing,[84] including 5,600 captured.[85] At the height of the fighting in May and June 2022, according to president Zelenskyy and presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, between 100 and 200 Ukrainian soldiers were being killed in combat daily,[86][87] while presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said 150 soldiers were being killed and 800 wounded daily.[88] Mid-June, Davyd Arakhamia, Ukraine's chief negotiator with Russia, told Axios that between 200 and 500 Ukrainian soldiers were killed every day.[89] By late July, Ukrainian daily losses fell to around 30 killed and about 250 wounded.[87] In August 2023, The New York Times quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that up to 70,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed and 100,000 to 120,000 wounded.[90][91] As of 25 February 2024, Ukraine confirmed 31,000 of its soldiers had been killed in the conflict.[92]\n\nAccording to the UALosses project started at the end of 2023, found to be reliable by Mediazona, Meduza and the Book of Memory group, themselves also running projects tracking military fatalities in the conflict,[93][94] it had documented by name the deaths of 52,562 Ukrainian fighters as of 24 July 2024,[12] including non-combat losses.[95]\n\nAs of mid-April 2023, around 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers remained missing, of whom some 60-65 per cent were believed to be prisoners.[96] The number of missing was updated to 15,000 by early October 2023.[97]\n\nYuriy Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General and member of the opposition party European Solidarity, said on Ukrainian television in January 2024 that around 500,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed or wounded, and that about 30,000 were becoming casualties every month.[98]\n\nUkrainian estimates of Russian military losses tended to be high, while Russian estimates of their own losses tended to be low. Combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources, including satellite imagery and video image of military actions.[99] According to a researcher at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University in Sweden, regarding Russian military losses, Ukraine engaged in a misinformation campaign to boost morale and Western media were generally happy to accept its claims, while Russia was \"probably\" downplaying its own casualties. Ukraine also tended to be quieter about its own military fatalities.[100] According to BBC News, Ukrainian claims of Russian fatalities included the injured as well.[101][102][103] Western countries emphasized the Russian military's toll, while Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting on the Russian death toll.[104] In early June 2022, the Svetlogorsk City Court in the Kaliningrad region ruled that a list of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, published by privately owned news websites, constituted \"classified information\" and its publication could be considered a criminal offense.[105]\n\nMen from the poverty-stricken regions of Russia's Far North, Far East and Siberia were overrepresented among Russian war casualties. Buryats, Kalmyks, Tuvans, Chukchi, and Nenets were reported as Russia's ethnic minority groups suffering disproportionately high casualty rates among Russian forces.[106] On the Ukrainian side, per UA Losses, as of 24 July 2024, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has the highest number of confirmed Ukrainian soldiers dead at 4,582, while the Kirovohrad Oblast has the highest confirmed death count per capita at 2.596 per 1,000.[107]\n\nIn terms of confirmed deaths of officers of both belligerents, according to groups collecting that information, 3,815 Russian officers had been killed as of 31 July 2024,[74] and 4,114 Ukrainian officers were dead as of 24 July 2024.[108]\n\nAccording to NATO and Western military officials, around 1,200 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded in Ukraine every day on average in May and June 2024.[109][110] In July 2024, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army Sir Roland Walker said that with the current way of fighting, it would take Russia five years to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia that Russia claims as its own, and it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties.[111] He said there are \"no winners\" in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding that \"it is an utter devastation for both sides and lost generations.\"[112] In June 2024, it was estimated that approximately 2% of all Russian men between the ages of 20 and 50 may have been killed or seriously wounded in Ukraine since February 2022.[82] According to a Western official, about 1,000 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded daily in the fighting in Kursk and Donbas in August 2024.[113]\n\nThe number of civilian and military deaths is impossible to determine with precision.[114][99] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) considers the number of civilian casualties to be considerably higher than the one the United Nations are able to certify.[115]\n\nBreakdown Casualties Time period Source Civilians 11,000+ killed (confirmed),[e]\n\n11,000 missing,\n\n1,600 captive 24 Feb. 2022 – 1 Dec. 2023\n\n24 Feb. 2022 – 5 Oct. 2023\n\n24 Feb. 2022 – 24 Jan. 2024 Ukraine[116][117][118][119] 11,520 killed, 23,640 wounded\n\n(confirmed minimum, thought higher) 24 February 2022 – 31 July 2024 United Nations[120] Ukrainian forces ~70,000 killed,\n\n100,000–120,000 wounded 24 February 2022 – 18 August 2023 US estimate[90][121] 35,000 killed (24,500 conf. by names),\n\n15,000 missing, 3,400 captured,\n\n90,000–100,000 wounded 24 February 2022 – 14 November 2023 Museum of Military History[122]\n\n(Book of Remembrance) 444,000 killed and wounded\n\n(5,962 foreign volunteers killed) 24 February 2022 – 27 February 2024 Russian Ministry of Defense[69][123] 52,562 killed (incl. non-combat,[95]\n\nconfirmed by names) 24 February 2022 – 24 July 2024 UALosses project[12] Ukrainian forces (NGU) 501 killed, 1,697 wounded 24 February 2022 – 12 May 2022 National Guard of Ukraine[124] Ukrainian forces (NPU) 124 killed 24 February 2022 – 18 June 2023 National Police of Ukraine[125] Ukrainian forces (ZSU) 31,000 killed, 7,000–15,500 missing 24 February 2022 – 25 February 2024 Ukraine[92][126][127] Russian forces 500,000 killed and wounded 24 February 2022 – 31 May 2024 UK estimate[128] 350,000 killed and wounded 24 February 2022 – 13 June 2024 US estimate[129] 107,140–134,400 killed 24 February 2022 – 26 July 2024 BBC News Russian estimate[75] 462,000–728,000 killed and wounded 24 February 2022 – 5 July 2024 The Economist estimate[82] 580,590 killed and wounded 24 February 2022 – 2 August 2024 Armed Forces of Ukraine[130] Russian forces\n\n(DPR & LPR militia excluded) 120,000–140,000 killed[f] 24 February 2022 – 30 June 2024 Meduza estimate[81] 87,140–110,900 killed\n\n(65,522 conf. by names) 24 February 2022 – 23 August 2024 BBC News Russian &\n\nMediazona estimate[74][75] Russian forces\n\n(PMC Wagner) 22,000 killed, 40,000 wounded 24 February 2022 – 20 May 2023 PMC Wagner[131] 20,000 killed, 40,000 wounded 24 February 2022 – 30 November 2023 UK estimate[132] Russian forces\n\n(PMCs Wagner, Redut & others) 12,031–19,939 killed\n\n(conf. by names) 24 February 2022 – 31 July 2024 BBC News Russian &\n\nMediazona[74][133] Russian forces\n\n(Donetsk & Luhansk PR) 20,000–23,500 killed 24 February 2022 – 26 July 2024 BBC News Russian estimate[75]\n\nCivilian deaths\n\nBy 31 July 2024, OHCHR had recorded 35,160 civilian casualties in Ukraine since February 24, 2022: 11,520 killed and 23,640 injured, but said they believe the real number is higher. This included 28,789 (8,943 killed and 19,846 injured) occurred on territory covered by the government of Ukraine and 6,371 (2,577 killed and 3,794 injured) on territory controlled by Russian armed forces or their affiliates. 9,778 deaths were caused by explosive weapons \"with wide area effects\", 391 by mines and explosive remnants, 1,351 by small arms, including from crossfire, or road accidents involving military or civilian vehicles.[120]\n\nAs of 30 June 2023, OHCHR said it had received information on 287 civilian casualties in Western Russia, with 58 killed and 229 injured, while six more were killed and 16 injured in the Republic of Crimea.[134] Another two civilians were killed and one injured in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Crimean bridge on 17 July 2023,[135] while five civilians were killed and 151 were injured by a Ukrainian missile attack in Sevastopol, in Crimea, on 23 June 2024.[136] Sergey Aksyonov, Russian-installed head of Crimea, also alleged that a Ukrainian attack on drilling platforms in the Black Sea near Crimea had left seven Chernomorneftegaz workers missing.[137] The 7x7 Russian opposition media outlet confirmed the deaths of 273 civilians in Russia by 1 July 2024, not including those in Crimea.[138] In addition, missiles struck the Polish border village of Przewodów in Lublin Voivodeship on 15 November 2022, and killed two Polish civilians.[139]\n\nIn April 2022, the civilian death toll included more than 200 children.[140] In March 2022, 55 of the war-related child deaths were from the Kyiv area and another 34 were from Kharkiv.[141] On 17 February 2023, the Ukrainian prosecutor general announced that at least 461 children had been killed since the start of the invasion, with a further 923 wounded.[142] Most of these child victims were from the Donetsk region.[142]\n\nBy February 2023, Ukrainian chief prosecutor for war crimes Yuriy Belousov claimed that \"there could be 100,000 civilians killed across Ukraine, whose bodies will have to be found and identified once occupied territory is liberated.\"[143] A Project on Defense Alternatives study calculated a \"modest\" figure of 40,000 Ukrainian civilian dead by April 2023.[144] In May 2023, US officials claimed Ukrainian civilian deaths were at 42,000, twice the then-estimated figure for Ukrainian military losses.[145] According to the Kyiv Independent, Russia does not allow monitoring in territories it controls, where civilian deaths are thought to be highest.[146]\n\nCivilian deaths by area (Ukrainian-controlled & formerly Ukrainian-controlled) Area Fatalities Time period Source Cherkasy Oblast 26 killed[g] 24 February 2022 – 31 December 2023 Ukrainian authorities Chernihiv Oblast 725+ killed[h] 24 February 2022 – 19 August 2023 Dnipropetrovsk Oblast 171 killed[i] 24 April 2022 – 15 May 2024 Donetsk Oblast 1,896–26,896 killed[j] 24 February 2022 – 30 March 2024 Kharkiv Oblast 1,699 killed[184] 24 February – 31 December 2022 Kherson Oblast 566 killed[k] 24 February 2022 – 30 May 2024 Khmelnytskyi Oblast 4 killed[l] 24 February 2022 – 27 February 2023 Kirovohrad Oblast 9 killed[m] 24 February 2022 – 4 January 2024 Kyiv 200 killed[230] 24 February 2022 – 24 February 2024 Kyiv Oblast 1,569 killed[231] 24 February – 2 April 2022 Luhansk Oblast 815 killed[232] 24 February – 31 December 2022 Lviv Oblast 22 killed[n] 18 April 2022 – 6 July 2023 Mykolaiv Oblast 413 killed[o] 24 February 2022 – 17 January 2023 Odesa Oblast 51 killed[p] 24 February 2022 – 2 March 2024 Poltava Oblast 22 killed[248] 27 June 2022 Rivne Oblast 25 killed[q] 24 February – 23 June 2022 Sumy Oblast 341 killed[232] 24 February – 31 December 2022 Vinnytsia Oblast 30 killed[r] 24 February 2022 – 14 March 2024 Volyn Oblast 8 killed[s] 24 February 2022 – 15 August 2023 Zaporizhzhia Oblast 88 killed[t] 24 February 2022 – 18 October 2023 Zhytomyr Oblast 283 killed[232] 24 February – 31 December 2022\n\nCivilian deaths by area (Russian-controlled areas and Russia) Area Fatalities Time period Source Donetsk People's Republic 1,689–5,036 killed[260][261] 26 February 2022 – 12 August 2024 Donetsk PR Luhansk People's Republic 972+ killed[262] 17 February 2022 – 28 December 2023 Luhansk PR Russian-anexed Kherson Oblast 41 killed[263] 6 June 2023 Russia Republic of Crimea 8 killed[134][135] 24 February 2022 – 17 July 2023 Russia Sevastopol 5 killed[136] 23 June 2024 Russia Western Russia 273 killed[138] 24 February 2022 – 1 July 2024 7x7\n\nCivilian deaths by area (outside of Russia and Ukraine) Area Fatalities Time period Source Lublin Voivodeship 2 killed[139] 15 November 2022 Polish government\n\nForeign civilians\n\nAt least 199 foreign citizens civilians from 24 countries are confirmed to have been killed during the war.

country had reached out to the International Committee of the Red Cross for help in the repatriation effort of the bodies of killed Russian soldiers.[545] Due to concerns that Russia was not reporting the number or any casualties of soldiers in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry began issuing appeals that same day for relatives of Russian soldiers to help identify wounded, captured, or killed soldiers. The initiative, called Ishchi Svoikh (Russian: Ищи Своих, lit. 'Look for Your Own'), appeared aimed in part at undermining morale and support for the war in Russia and was quickly blocked by the Russian government's media regulator the day the initiative began at the request of Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office.[546][100]\n\nUkrainian authorities began using facial recognition technology supplied to them by Clearview AI on 12 March 2022, to help identify the deceased, along with potentially using it to uncover Russian spies, vet people at checkpoints and potentially combat misinformation. The Chief Executive of Clearview claimed that the technology could be more effective than matching fingerprints or other identifiable aspects of the individual, although a study by US Department of Energy raised concerns about decomposition reducing its effectiveness.[547] Kyiv authorities have also reached out to the International Commission on Missing Persons, which was formed to help after the 1990s Balkan conflicts and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, and identifies individuals by collecting DNA samples from the deceased and families to cross match. The organization will also document the location of the body and how the individual died.[548]\n\nAs Russian soldiers began to retreat the identification of the dead civilians who had been unreported due to communication issues and constant fighting began to be reported. Documentation and identification of the bodies began with many hastily dug graves and rubble being cleared away to photograph and identify the bodies as well as count the number involved. Handwritten tags and passports have been attached to the bodies after identification before they are taken by coroners and officials.[549] In some locations villagers kept track of the deceased, such as in Yahidne, a village north of Kyiv, where they used a school basement wall to write the names of the deceased while under Russian control.[550]\n\nAs of late May 2022, Ukrainian authorities had stored at least 137 bodies of Russian soldiers that were collected near Kyiv,[551] as well as 62 in the Kharkiv region.[552] During June, the bodies of 374 Russian soldiers were exchanged for the bodies of 365 Ukrainian servicemen between Ukraine and Russia.[553][554][555][556]\n\nAmputations\n\nOn 2 August 2023, an investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that Ukrainian medical amputations in the war came to between 20,000 and 50,000 including both military and civilians. In comparison, during World War One 41,000 British and 67,000 Germans needed amputations.[557]\n\nPrisoners of war\n\nRussia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,[558] while Ukraine claimed 562 Russian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 19 March,[559] with 10 previously reported released in prisoner exchanges for five Ukrainian soldiers and the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov.[560][561] Subsequently, the first large prisoner exchange took place on 24 March, when 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russian and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.[562][563][564] Among the released Ukrainian soldiers was one of 13 Ukrainian border-guard members captured during the Russian attack on Snake Island.[565] Later, on 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged[566] for an unknown number of Russian troops.[567]\n\nUkraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, reported that a platoon of the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Kemerovo Oblast surrendered to Ukraine, saying they \"didn't know that they were brought to Ukraine to kill Ukrainians\".[568] Ukraine held a series of press conferences with about a dozen POWs, where the POWs made comments against the invasion, how they had been manipulated and for the conflict to end. According to The Guardian, while it was likely that Ukraine was using the discomfort of captured soldiers for propaganda purposes, still the videos succeeded in showing the Russian servicemen's \"authentic sense\" of regret for having come to Ukraine.[569] Amnesty International said that Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention prohibits videos of captured soldiers.[570] Captured Ukrainian soldiers with British citizenship were recorded calling for Boris Johnson to arrange for them to be freed in exchange for pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk. MP Robert Jenrick called the videos, broadcast separately on Russia-24, a \"flagrant breach\" of the Geneva Convention. A Russian spokeswoman claimed that she told Johnson in a phone call about the men's treatment that the UK should \"show mercy\" to Ukrainian citizens by stopping military aid to the Ukrainian government when asked to show the men mercy.[571]\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for POW Treatment, Iryna Vereshchuk, raised concerns that Russia had not released information to Ukrainian authorities on the location of any Ukrainian POW's and the International Red Cross had not been allowed to see them, as of 16 March.[572]\n\nBy 21 April, Russia claimed that 1,478 Ukrainian troops had been captured during the course of the siege of Mariupol.[573] On 22 April, Yuri Sirovatko, Minister of Justice of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed that some 3,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war were held in the territory of the DPR.[574] On 20 May, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that 2,439 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken prisoner over the previous five days as a result of the surrender of the last defenders of Mariupol, entrenched inside the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.[575] On 26 May, Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador of the Luhansk People's Republic to Russia, claimed that around 8,000 Ukrainian POWs were held within the territory of the DPR and LPR.[576] According to a statement by Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Minister of Defence, in early June 2022, 6,489 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[577]\n\nIn a report by The Independent on 9 June, it cited an intelligence report that more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers had been captured, while the number of Russian servicemen being held as prisoners had fallen to 550, from 900 in April, following several prisoner exchanges.[85] In contrast, the Ukrayinska Pravda newspaper claimed 1,000 Russian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 20 June.\n\nAccording to Ukraine, as of 30 December 2022, 3,392 Ukrainian servicemen were being held by Russia as prisoners of war, while 15,000 soldiers and civilians were missing.[578] The ICMP also stated a month earlier that 15,000 people were missing since the start of the Russian invasion.[579] The following day, 31 December, 140 Ukrainian servicemen were released in a prisoner exchange, bringing the number of released prisoners from Russian captivity to 1,464 servicemen and 132 civilians.[580] As of mid-November 2023, according to Ukraine, 4,337 Ukrainians were still being held by Russia, including 3,574 soldiers and 763 civilians,[581] while by this point 2,598 Ukrainians had been released.[582] As of early June 2024, according to Russia, 6,465 Ukrainian soldiers were still being held prisoner in Russia and 1,348 Russian soldiers were prisoners in Ukraine,[583] while by this point 3,210 Ukrainians had been confirmed released.[584] By 24 August 2024, the number of prisoners released by Russia rose to 3,520,[585] including 161 civilians.[586][587] At least 800 Russian soldiers had also been confirmed to have been released by late February 2023.[588]\n\nA study of Russian prisoners of war captured by Ukraine found that 55% of the soldiers had been motivated to fight to \"improve their livelihoods\", while 36% were ideologically motivated.[589]\n\nDates of\n\nprisoner exchanges Russian POWs Ukrainian POWs 1 March 2022 1 soldier 5 soldiers [560] 16 March 2022 9
