Fuzz Sufian BSc. , SPM, PMR, UPSR, Prakash Logan and Nanda Kumar. The smiles have returned on the faces of industry players who are once again back in the black and busy meeting the rising global demand for the black gold which fell sharply while Covid-19 was raging. Against the backdrop of economic rebound post-pandemic, geopolitical tensions and capacity constraints, consumption of fossil fuel is showing no sign of relenting despite the global move towards energy transition. Companies are having their hands full supporting oil and gas majors in their exploration and production activities which have gathered considerable pace following the reopening of economies and the full resumption of business and daily activities.\n\nPetroliam Nasional Bhd (#Petronas), which is seeking to establish a carbon capture and storage (#CCS) hub in Pahang, has inked a land rental agreement with #KuantanPort Consortium Sdn Bhd for the project. The hub, which is expected to have its first injection by 2029, is intended to play a key role in reducing carbon emissions for hard-to-abate industries locally and internationally. Petronas noted the location of the hub is ideal for an integrated CCS value chain and future growth, and is expected to create new economic opportunities and benefits for the surrounding communities. Petronas added the strategic move enables knowledge transfer with Kuantan Port, which has a strong track record in handling diverse cargo types, fostering regional trade growth and implementing modern logistics solutions. The national oil company has also tied up with the likes of #ExxonMobil and #Shell Malaysia to explore the development of other CCS projects and carbon sequestration hubs in the country, as it seeks to unlock Malaysiaâ€™s potential as a regional CCS solutions hub. According to reports, Petronas has allocated 20% of its annual capital expenditure (capex) from 2022 to 2026 for its overall decarbonisation efforts. ~ TheEdgeMalaysia & UpstreamOnline\n\n\"LOCAL CONTENT IN THE OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES AS FACTOR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN CÃ”TE Dâ€™IVOIRE\" Happy for having taken part of this event marking the beginning of a great adventure in petroleum industry for us as young graduates. We hope the best for the future starting by a good tracking of this process. Here in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire we have people with good training and enough knowledges and competencies looking for their first experience particularly in O&G industry but a bit difficult to find due to the challenges the companies are facing, so they always looking for skilled and experienced people. Most of the time foreigners are selected instead of local people who just needs an opportunity to prove their ability to perform the work. We all trust and encourage this process to promote the local content (company, fresh graduates , local experienced people etcâ€¦) to keep moving forward because we are the key of the development and the future.

We will continue to advocate and influence the stakeholders for equitable and fair opportunities for OGSE sector to thrive in respective business journeys.ðŸŽ¯ ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Thanking PETRONAS to accept the delegation from the industry to discuss and address challenges associated with licencing and etc. With the radiance of blessed Ramadan, alhamdulillah has excellent discussion and reached a good immediate resolution that will benefit everyone in OGSE sector that is affected by the same issues faced by the patrons. More information should be made official by MOGSC to all the members.âœ… We look forward to working with PETRONAS on this matter to find a long term solution that safeguards the related governance and at the sametime provides a feasible solution for business continuity. #OGSEThriving #MalaysiaOilandGasIndustry\n\nEarlier this year, OSRL Responders from the Asia-Pacific region had the opportunity to conduct a joint inland fast river booming exercise with Petroleum Industry Of Malaysia Mutual Aid Group (PIMMAG) in Malaysia. In the event of an oil spill in Malaysia, PIMMAG will respond to the incident as a Tier 2 Oil Spill Response organization. OSRL, functioning as a Tier 3 OSRO, may also collaborate with PIMMAG to assist with incident response. To further develop the partnership between both entities, OSRL & PIMMAG decided to conduct joint exercises to strengthen coordination and facilitate knowledge exchange. Additionally, responders based in Singapore have limited exposure to inland operations due to the scarcity of suitable training facilities in the country - particularly rivers with fast flow rate. This led to the inception of joint inland exercises in Port Dickson, Malaysia in 2018 with PIMMAG. Following positive feedback from the previous responders that attended that training, OSRL decided to bring back the training exercise this year! Once again, a successful collaboration boosting our readiness for any future challenges! ðŸ™Œ #osrl #oilspillreponseltd #osrlexercise #preparedness"
