        "text": "News\n\nTDI-Brooks has successfully completed a geotechnical coring project for Geohidra in the Southern Gulf of Mexico. The operation, conducted aboard the MV Laguna Azule, involved thirty-two cone penetration tests using the Neptune 3000 system.\n\nNews\n\nShell will migrate from their current in-house software to Imaging AnyWare, a modern, fully integrated enterprise-class imaging system renowned for its efficiency, flexibility and usability. The choice of TGS’ Imaging AnyWare represents a significant validation of the software's excellence.\n\nNews\n\nElectromagnetic Geoservices ASA has entered into an agreement for a fully pre-funded offshore Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey in the Barents Sea. This survey, which will be undertaken in collaboration with Velocitas Geo Solutions, marks EMGS' first venture into seismic node projects.\n\nNews\n\nGeorgetown aims to acquire, process, and interpret high-quality 3D seismic data to aid in the exploration and development of oil and gas resources in the Guyana-Suriname basin. This data will also be used for future bidding and licensing rounds.\n\nArticle\n\nThis article discusses the significance of nodal technology for geophysical data acquisition in the oil and gas industry, and STRYDE’s participation in the world’s largest nodal survey in the Middle East.\n\nNews\n\nThe merger of TGS and PGS forms a powerhouse in the energy sector, enhancing its capabilities to support energy exploration and production on a global scale. This integration will enable the company to leverage a wider pool of technological resources and expertise, significantly boosting its operational efficiency, innovation and customer engagement strategies.\n\nNews\n\nNC JSC QazaqGaz (QazaqGaz) and Chevron Corporation, through its subsidiary Chevron Munaigas Inc., have signed a cooperation agreement which will entail potential geological exploration at the Zhalibek site in the Aktobe region, near the Zhanazhol and Urikhtau fields.\n\nNews\n\nUnder this agreement, TGS holds the exclusive rights to license all of Tanzania’s offshore mainland data on behalf of the government. The agreement also grants TGS the authority to conduct future acquisition of new seismic data and to reprocess existing data. Additionally, it includes support for upcoming licensing rounds, which are anticipated to commence in 2025.\n\nNews\n\nUsing Sonardyne’s proprietary optical and acoustic communications technologies, and drawing on its extensive experience of seabed monitoring, OD OBN expects to provide a versatile, lower cost, more resilient solution for time-lapse seismic and subsidence monitoring of producing reservoirs with better data and the capacity to be placed on the ocean floor for up to five years without human intervention.\n\nNews\n\nSupported by TGS' extensive geological database, which includes data from over 425,000 wells and various interpretive products in the Permian basin, this survey offers a comprehensive resource for exploration and development.\n\nNews\n\nThe MoU establishes a governance platform supporting Petrobras’ and Shearwater’s joint effort to innovate technologies that improve insights to the subsurface and enhance data value, while also reducing the time, cost and environmental impact of seismic acquisition projects.\n\nNews\n\nThis initiative will rejuvenate the remaining 2D and 3D data in Liberia's prospective Liberia and Harper basins. The project will integrate existing legacy datasets to create a unified velocity model in depth, utilizing cutting-edge imaging algorithms to produce the final migrated seismic data.\n\nNews\n\nWhile PGS didn’t reveal the exact location of the contract, recent finds in Namibia and Uruguay suggest the work will take place in these emerging exploration hot spots.\n\nNews\n\nActivities include acquiring over 26,000 km2 of 3D seismic data, drilling at least four deepwater research wells, and geoscientific studies in the Save and Angoche offshore regions.\n\nNews\n\nBy combining Chevron’s artificial-intelligence models for automated fault detection, with Eliis’s global methods for advanced seismic interpretation, the time needed to perform structural interpretation, in all geological settings, can be reduced by orders of magnitude.\n\nNews\n\nThe survey revealed a Messinian evaporite layer of variable thickness extends across most of the area. The survey is tied to the Kiwi-1 well, one of the few wells in this deepwater area, and primary targets are likely to be pre-salt Oligo-Miocene structures with clastic reservoirs.\n\nNews\n\nTGS has expanded the coverage of its CO2 storage assessment datasets by adding eight additional U.S. onshore basins. These basins include Gulf Coast Onshore, Permian, Illinois, Michigan, Appalachia, North Dakota, Sacramento-San Joaquin and DJ, including interpretation on more than 43,000 wells across 378 million acres.\n\nNews\n\nLeading the new deals is the purchase of 25,000 STRYDE Nodes™ by first-time client, Ukrainian seismic acquisition firm, Georozvidka LLC. The technology will be used for multiple 2D and 3D seismic surveys in Ukraine, supporting national and global energy security through the enablement of new oil and gas exploration projects."
