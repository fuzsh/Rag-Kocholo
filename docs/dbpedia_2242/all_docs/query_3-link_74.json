        "text": "Over the past twenty years, the biggest challenge to the national security of the independent states from the Baltic to the Black Sea region has been in the energy sector. The problem has mostly been the failure to secure stable energy resource provisions. This is mostly due to systemic and historical as well as internal political factors. This paper examines the problems related to the energy security of the following three ex-Soviet bloc countries: Lithuanian, Belarus and Ukraine. The main energy problem areas discussed here are oil and natural gas resources. Because the three countries have pursued very different internal and foreign security policies, their energy needs are equally divergent. Therefore, the paper presents case study for each state. Each case study, firstly, identifies a number of possible threats to energy security, secondly, examines the influences that these threats may exact on national as well as foreign policies and, thirdly, discusses how different national and foreign policies influence the resolution of energy security problems.\n\nAsymmetric interdependencies with Russia have been identified as a key factor influencing domestic change in response to EU policies in Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries. As argued in the literature, interdependencies can either facilitate or constrain EU-demanded change, depending on whether they are associated with EaP countries’ sensitivity or vulnerability to Russia’s policies. In this paper, we provide a systematic mapping and process-tracing of interdependencies in three EaP countries (Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine) and four key sectors (trade, migration, energy and security). We further explore Russia’s use of interdependencies and attempts at issue-linkage between the above sectors. Finally, we scrutinize domestic elites’ responses to Russia’s strategies. Drawing upon the distinction between sensitivity and vulnerability, we seek in particular to identify the conditions under which Russia’s policies effectively incentivize or disincentivize the political elites in EaP countries to engage with the EU’s and Russia’s policies. We find that Russia’s attempts to link issues (even if to varying degrees across countries and sectors) effectively undermined further integration with the EU in those cases where policy alternatives were too costly for the incumbent elites. By contrast, Russia’s use of nexuses between different policy sectors have facilitated or even supported integration with the EU when the latter offered an affordable alternative to the EaP countries.\n\nThe book analyses activities of Russian state-owned energy companies in the region of the Central and Eastern Europe and offers a complex analysis of their behavioural patterns with regard to the operational environment. The main incentives for making this study were traditionally strong ties between the Russian Federation and the region as well as currently worsening relations between Russia and the West, especially with regard to the crisis in Ukraine. The study focuses on the sectors of nuclear energy and natural gas where Russian influence is perceived as especially sensitive. The aim of the study was to find out whether Russian state-owned enterprises in the aforementioned sectors can be perceived as foreign policy tools. The study is a result of an extensive research project conducted by a research team consisting of analysts from the Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University and the Prague-based think-tank Prague security Studies Institute. For the purpose of the study, the research team developed behavioural models upon which behavioural patterns of the Russian companies Gazprom and Rosatom were assessed. The study is focused on 12 countries and includes also an extensive field research and use of analytical software. For complex understanding of the strategy of both aforementioned companies, chapters aimed on their position in Asia as well as the chapter concerned with the energy policy of the European Union are included. Given the complexity of the presented study, the findings can be used by both broader public and experts, as well as practitioners and decision makers in state administration and private sector."
