Dec 4 (Interfax) - KazMunayGas has put the East Urikhtau field in Kazakhstan's Aktobe region commercially in stream, Kazakhstan's national oil and gas company said in a press release. \"Oil production in Eastern Urikhtau is expected to amount to 89,000 tonnes of oil and about 46 million cubic meters of gas in 2024. As mature oil and gas fields become depleted, the commissioning of this field is of particular importance in terms of increasing hydrocarbon resources to ensure the country's energy security,\" KMG said.\n\nIndraprastha Gas Q1 FY25 Analysis: Key takeaways!! . . Indraprastha Gas Limited demonstrated resilient performance in Q1 FY25, with overall sales volume increasing by 5% year-on-year to 786 million standard cubic meters. The company is targeting an exit rate of 9.5 MMSCMD by the end of FY25, up from 8.64 MMSCMD in Q1. Management expects 10-12% volume growth over the next 5-6 years, driven by expansion in new geographical areas (GAs) and entry into the LNG retail business.

This addition of 3 million metric standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of gas from the Ghazij Gas Field is now being supplied to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). The company has successfully completed testing and production, paving the way for a comprehensive development plan for the Ghazij Gas Field. This plan will soon be submitted to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) for approval. This development is expected to strengthen Pakistan's gas supply and enhance energy security. The integration of new gas reserves is a positive step towards meeting the country's growing energy demands. . . . #GasReserves #PakistanEnergy #MariPetroleum #SNGPL #EnergySecurity #tribunetrends\n\nThank you Hydrogen Intelligence - H2lligence for sharing and @George Etomi & Partners fir publishing. Nigeria has enormous potential to become a regional leader in green hydrogen production. Despite lagging behind other African countries, Nigeria has a robust gas distribution infrastructure and experience in the renewable energy sector, making it well-positioned to accelerate its movement towards utility-scale infrastructure for green hydrogen production. With the country's large oil and gas industry, Nigeria could potentially enter the green hydrogen sector after making entry into blue hydrogen. The explosive growth of dialogues, workshops, and discussions on green hydrogen in Nigeria since early 2023 is a promising sign of the country's readiness for this transition. Let's keep our eyes on Nigeria's potential for green hydrogen production and regional leadership. #GreenHydrogen #RenewableEnergy #Nigeria #Sustainability\n\nTrillion Energy International Inc. (CSE:TCF, OTCQB:TRLEF) expects to produce an average of 23,096 MCF (1,000 cubic feet) per day at its South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (SASB) gas field in the #BlackSea during 2024. Based on optimization work at the SASB field to ensure all six drilled and completed wells are able to produce concurrently, the company said it expects to exit 2023 with SASB field production of 15,397 MCF per day. Optimization work includes the addition of a compressor at the Cayagzi #gas process facility to reduce inlet pressure from 125 to 135 pounds per square inch (psi) to 50 to 60 psi and the installation of an artificial lift to reduce water loading in two of the six wells. #TrillionEnergy said to meet its 2024 production guidance, it intends to drill five new sidetracked production wells from existing platforms at the SASB gas field to raise the total number of producing wells to 11.

In my opinion, engineering services companies such as John Crane will play a critical role in enabling the application of technologies in the oil and gas industry. Understanding that hydrocarbons will continue to play a role in energy production globally, and that the transition will take time #energytransition #arpelnaturgas #oilandgas #johncrane"
