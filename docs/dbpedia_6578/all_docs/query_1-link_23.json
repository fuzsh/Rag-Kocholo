        "text": "What a surprisingly fun time in a super brisk runtime. I noticed this was made by the same guy who made Hypnotic Eye which I had a great time with, and it's about to expire, so I decided to give it a watch. Though this one feels a bit too familiar, it's still a fun silly haunted house comedy with lots and lots of silly slapstick gags. It starts with a standard slapstick comedy which honestly can get very monotonous after a while. But once it gets to the haunted house part, it really becomes entertaining. The last minutes are absolutely delightful. It's definitely not scary as the emphasis is more on laughs than thrills but it certainly has the charm that draw me in.\n\nThis was made in 1957, but really it could have been made in 1947 or even 1937; this type of nonsense was undulated timeless Hollywood studio system product until it wasn’t. This was the first Bowery Boys movie I had seen without Leo Gorcey who ended his time as a Bowery Boy by asking for more money in 1955. He usually got the best laughs continuously butchering the English language, but Spook Chasers didn’t suffer too much with his absence as Huntz Hall was more than able to handle the sole spotlight. He’s especially funny when the film’s femme fatale tries to coax important information out of him with booze. Luckily, his fellow Bowery Boys were real cock blockers. The Spooks angle doesn’t rear its head until the last 15 minutes, and it’s fun but obviously they came up with the movie ‘s title before the script.\n\nIt's not that Leo Gorcey was a necessary component to these films, it's just that removing him doesn't really make them that much better. Had this really played up the old, dark house element I think this could've actually been fun, but it really doesn't do that. It takes far too long to get to that point, and there's a whole lot of boring material along the way. Shooting sparks out of a sink is the high point of the film, and it's all downhill from there.\n\nThe Bowery Boys were definitely running on fumes by 1957 when they shot SPOOK CHASERS, having already made GHOST CHASERS, SPOOK BUSTERS, and SPOOKS RUN WILD earlier in their careers. Leo Gorcey, of course, was no longer part of the ensemble, having retired in grief after the accidental death of his father Bernard, who played sweet shop owner Louie in the series, a year earlier. Gorcey’s replacement, Stanley Clements (as Duke), was not the comic that his predecessor was, and his bullying of Huntz Hall’s Sach came across as meaner than the malaproping Gorcey.\n\nGeorge Blair, directing his second Bowery Boys comedy, also made many episodes of ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and brought in Robert Shayne (SUPERMAN’s Inspector Henderson) and frequent…\n\nBetter than Bowery Boys Meet The Monsters as it is way more focused, and Huntz Hall is the only over the top guy. Still, this isn't hitting the beats that I like in broad slapstick (good comedic momentum, that builds throughout the film), and its plot is pretty typical of the time.\n\nAmusing Bowery Boys entry that goes by at a good pace. The gang moves into a dilapidated farmhouse, which they find to be haunted after doing repairs and paying the mortgage, which is a decent idea for a plot for the time. With that in mind, the horror aspects are subtle in the first half of the movie, but the second half still kind of makes up for it by having a bed that keeps sliding into a wall and a pair of ominously shadowed hands that hold a trumpet. The gags work from both a comedic and a haunted house perspective, and you can tell that the actors had a good time being involved in the production. I thought…\n\nThe 45th and 4th last film in the Bowery Boys series sees Huntz Hall and the boys moving into an old mansion which may be haunted.\n\nIt's pretty standard and uses all of the usual haunted house comedy tropes but there are a few funny elements here and there that made it decent.\n\nHall received the only star billing as Leo Gorcey had left at this point after asking for too much money. Though not as good as Gorcey in his heyday Stanley Clements does a capable job as the new leader of the boys. I also like Eddie LeRoy as Blinky who is a cross between Arnold Stang and maybe Rick Moranis' Dad.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series and moreso Huntz Hall's mugging and style of comedy it's a worthwhile watch.\n\nThe first Bowery Boys picture without Leo Gorcey in it that I've seen (following his unceremonious firing for asking for more pay). Despite the addition of Percy Helton as Mike Clancy (the new shop owner whose store the Boys terrorize with their presence alone), Eddie LeRoy as Blinky, and the ascendance of Stanley Clements as Stanislaus \"Duke\" Covelske into the \"Slip\"-esque leader role, this picture is really missing Leo Gorcey.\n\nAs much as I enjoy Huntz Hall as Sach in the earlier films, he was never meant to be the star of this series and you can really feel it in his performance (he even attempts some of Gorcey's malapropisms, but less effectively). Likewise, Stanley Clements struggles to preserve the…\n\nIt doesn’t aim very high, but it was an easy watch.\n\nI am curious about this series. After watching this I read a bit about and it seems like this is not the best outing for these characters.\n\nAs a big fan of No Time For Sergeants it was interesting to finally see Eddie LeRoy in something else."
