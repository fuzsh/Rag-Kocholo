        "text": "Actors\n\nBéla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó (October 20, 1882 – August 16, 1956), known professionally as Bela Lugosi, was a Hungarian-American actor best remembered for portraying Count Dracula in Tod Browning‘s 1931 film (a role he originated on Broadway) and for his roles in other horror films. After playing small parts on the stage in his native Hungary, Lugosi gained his first role in a film in 1917. He had to leave the country after the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919 because of his socialist activism. He acted in several films in Weimar Germany before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his potential casting, and he unsuccessfully tried to avoid typecasting.\n\nMeanwhile, he was often paired with Boris Karloff, who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi, a charter member of the American Screen Actors Guild, was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally so that they could put his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in Edward G. Ulmer’s The Black Cat (1934), Lew Lander’s The Raven (1935), and Rowland V. Lee’s Son of Frankenstein (1939), starring Basil Rathbone; even in The Raven, Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role.\n\nOther notable roles include Ernst Lubitsch’s Ninotchka (1939), starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas; You’ll Find Out (1940), with Karloff and Peter Lorre; The Wolf Man (1941), with Lon Chaney Jr.; Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), in which he played the Monster; Voodoo Man (1944), with John Carradine; and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948).\n\nBy this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for sciatic neuritis, and he became addicted to morphine and methadone. This drug dependence was known to producers, and the offers eventually dwindled to a few parts in Edward D. Wood Jr.‘s low-budget films—including Glen or Glenda (1953), Bride of the Monster (1955), co-starring Tor Johnson; and a brief appearance in Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). Lugosi was married five times and had one son, Bela George. Martin Landau would portray him in the Tim Burton film Ed Wood (1994), with Johnny Depp as Wood.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)\n\nLeoni Leo (1917) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Alfréd Deésy -Hungary\n\nMasked Ball (1917) – credited as Arisztid Olt – directed by Alfréd Deésy – aka Álarcosbál – Hungary\n\nLili (1918) – credited as Arisztid Olt – directed by Cornelius Hintner – Hungary\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray (1918) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Alfréd Deés – aka Az Élet királya – Hungary\n\nThe Antique Dealer (1918) – directed by Alfréd Deésy – credited as Arisztid Olt – aka A Régiséggyüjtöshort – Hungary\n\nThe Wedding Song (1918) – directed by Alfréd Deésy – Hungary\n\nSpring Tempest (1918) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Alfréd Deésy – aka Tavaszi vihar – Hungary\n\n99 (1918) – credited as Albert Lugesi -directed by Michael Curtiz (as Mihály Kertész) – aka A 99-es számú bérkocsi – Hungary\n\nStruggle for Life (1918) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Alfréd Deésy – aka Küzdelem a LétértHungary\n\nThe Colonel (1918) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Michael Curtiz (as Kertész Mihály) – aka Az Ezredes – Hungary\n\nThe Leopard (1918) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Alfréd Deésy – aka A leopárd – Hungary\n\nLulu (1918) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Michael Curtiz (as Kertész Mihály) – Hungary\n\nDaughter of the Night (1918) – aka Der Fluch der bösen Tat – Germany/Hungary\n\nCasanova (1919) – credited as Olt Arisztid – directed by Alfréd Deésy – Hungary\n\nNecklace of the Dead (1919) – Germany\n\nHypnosis (1920) – directed by Richard Eichberg – aka Hypnose – Germany\n\nDance on the Volcano (1920) – directed by Richard Eichberg – aka Der Tanz auf dem Vulkan – Germany\n\nThe Slave Holders of Kansas-City (1920) – directed by Wolfgang Neff – Die Sklavenhalter von Kansas-City – Germany\n\nNat Pinkerton in the Fight (1920) – directed by Wolfgang Neff – aka Nat Pinkerton im Kampf – Germany\n\nThe Head of Janus (1920) – directed by F.W.
