        "text": "Fellow Svengoolie SvenPals everywhere will be jumping for joy for his upcoming big broadcast premiere of a cult classic sci-fi/thriller masterpiece.\n\n“Svengoolie” presents his big broadcast premiere of “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962)\n\nOriginal 1962 theatrical trailer for Wesley Barry’s “Creation of the Humanoids.” Sidebar: Due to the source material of the footage for the original theatrical trailer, you may have to turn up your volume. –C.H.\n\nThe legendary Berwyn/Chicago-based sci-fi feature film host will present his big broadcast premiere of “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962), this Sat.; July 31 at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central on Me-TV.\n\nThe 1962 cult classic sci-fi masterpiece production was directed by actor-turned-veteran director Wesley Barry. Barry started his motion picture career as a child actor at the age of seven when a talent scout from the Kalem Company, one of the pioneering film studios; spotted young Barry. One of his earliest credited feature film appearance was in the role of Mrs. Mum’s son Chance E. Ward’s Kalem comedy production of “The Phoney Cannibal” (1915) with comedians Lloyd “Ham” Hamilton and “Bud” Duncan. Barry would later direct numerous feature films and TV shows throughout the majority of his motion picture and TV production career as an assistant director.\n\nAlongside “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962), some of Barry’s productions that he worked as an assistant director on included William Beaudine’s Monogram (the future Allied Artists) production of “Tuna Clipper” (1949)* with Roddy McDowall, Elena Verdugo and Roland Winters; Beaudine’s classic mammoth Monogram “Bowery Boys” spook-comedy masterpiece with Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Lloyd Corrigan, Lela Bliss and Bernard Gorcey; “Ghost Chasers” (1951); 15 episodes of Jack Wrather’s classic “Lassie” mammoth masterpiece TV series (1962-64), Roger Corman’s classic mammoth Twentieth Century Fox (Twentieth Century Studios) action-historical drama masterpiece with Jason Robards, George Segal, Jean Hale, Ralph Meeker, John Agar, Joseph Campanella and young Bruce Dern; “The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre” (1967). One of Barry’s final productions as an assistant director was for Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg’s classic ABC television action-drama masterpiece series, “The Rookies” (Barry worked on 14 episodes of the Spelling-Goldberg series from 1972-75).\n\nBarry also co-produced “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962) with veteran Monogram/Allied Artists feature film music composer Edward J. Kay. The screenplay for Barry’s 1962 cult classic sci-fi masterpiece entry was written by veteran screenwriter Jay Simms, who also wrote the screenplay adaptation with Jay Simms for the Ken Curtis (of TV’s “Gunsmoke” fame)-Ray Kellogg cult classic sci-fi/creature masterpiece production for radio station owner Gordon McLendon’s firm, “The Giant Gila Monster” (1959, which was one of McLendon’s few motion picture productions). Simms’ screenplay for “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962) was adapted from Jack Williamson’s novel of the same name.\n\n“Creation of the Humanoids” (1962) was produced by Genie Productions and was released theatrically through independent distribution firm Emerson Film Enterprises, according to IMDB. Emerson Film Enterprises is best known to many “Mystery Science Theater 3000”/MST3K MSTies as the original theatrical distributor for Harold P. Warren’s cult horror production of “Manos: The Hands of Fate” (1966); “Manos” was famously riffed on MST3K on Comedy Central back in 1993 with original series host/creator Joel Hodgson (as Joel Robinson), Trace Beaulieu (as Mad scientist Dr. Clayton Forester/the vocal stylings of Crow T. Robot), Frank Conniff (as Mad scientist TV’s Frank) and Kevin Murphy (the vocal stylings of Tom Servo) in ep. #424, according to the MST3K Info Guide site/Satellite News.\n\nWho was in “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962)?\n\nThe players who appeared in Wesley Barry’s cult classic sci-fi masterpiece production of “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962) were Don Megowan (as Capt. Kenneth Cragis), Erica Elliott (as Maxine Megan), Frances McCann (as Esme Cragis Milos), Don Doolittle (as Dr. Raven), David Cross (as Pax), Richard Vath (as Mark), Reid Hammond (as Hart), Malcolm Smith (as Court), George Milan (as Acto), Dudley Manlove (as Lagan), Pat Bradley (in an uncredited role as Dr. Moffitt) and Gil Frye (in an uncredited role as Orus).\n\nIn addition to his numerous film and TV roles throughout his acting career, Don Megowan was best known for his role of the Gill-Man creature/monster for land sequences in John Sherwood’s classic mammoth Universal Studios “Gill- Man”/”Creature From the Black Lagoon” monster masterpiece with Ricou Browning, Leigh Snowden, Rex Reason and Gregg Palmer; “The Creature Walks Among Us” (1956, the final feature in Universal’s classic mammoth “Creature”/”Gill-Man” monster masterpiece trilogy series).

Barry’s other production, the live-action/animated family short subject featurette; “The Jolly Genie” (1962) served as the inspiration for the name of Barry’s production firm. Both “Creation of the Humanoids” and “The Jolly Genie” were released theatrically through Emerson Film Enterprises.\n\nWesley Barry’s “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962): Alien make-up effects from one of cinema’s legendary veteran monster and creature make-up artists\n\nWesley Barry’s cult classic production of “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962) had the distinction of having the actors’ alien make-up effects created by one of cinema’s legendary make-up artists who specialized in pioneering make-up techniques for distinctive classic mammoth monster and horror feature film masterpieces earlier in his film career. According to IMDB, legendary veteran feature film monster/horror feature film make-up artist Jack Pierce worked on the make-up effects for the alien creatures in the film.\n\nPierce was best-known for his past monster/creature make-up creations for Universal Studios’ classic mammoth monster masterpiece productions; including Bela Lugosi in Tod Browning’s adaptation of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” (1931), Boris Karloff in James Whale’s adaptation of Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” (1931), Karloff in Karl Freund’s “The Mummy” (1932), Claude Rains in James Whale’s adaptation of H.G. Wells’ “The Invisible Man” (1933), Elsa Lanchester and Boris Karloff in James Whale’s “Bride of Frankenstein” (1935), Lon Chaney Jr. in George Waggner’s “The Wolf Man” (1941) and Claude Rains in Arthur Lubin’s Technicolor adaptation of “Phantom of the Opera” (1943). Pierce’s career at Universal ended in 1947 due in part to the studio’s merger with International Pictures (as “Universal-International”); Pierce freelanced for other production firms for the remainder of his career, according to the Universal retrospective featurette on the life and career of Jack Pierce, “He Who Made Monsters: The Life and Art of Jack Pierce” (2008).\n\nTo promote the screening for “Creation of the Humanoids” in Los Angeles, California; Pierce decided to apply the “humanoid” alien creature make-up effects to veteran Los Angeles broadcast announcer and host of KHJ-TV (today’s KCAL-TV) and the station’s “Million Dollar Movie,” Wayne Thomas; according to additional details from IMDB and Monsters From The Vault.\n\n“Creation of the Humanoids” (1962): Released as a double-feature presentation with another Emerson-distributed feature\n\nAccording to the American Film Institute’s database entry article on “Creation of the Humanoids” (1962), Wesley Barry’s cult classic sci-fi masterpiece production was released as a double-feature presentation with another Emerson-distributed feature film release.
