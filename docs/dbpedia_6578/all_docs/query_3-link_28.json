        "text": "I am preparing to help out with the annual classic film festival Cinecon which is held every Labor Day Weekend in Hollywood at the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.\n\nOne actress who worked heaps and heaps in the 20's and 30's- Marie Prevost- will have several of her films screened there\n\nflapperjane.com\n\nI have become so intrigued and fascinated with her story and appeal that I decided she needed a thread.\n\nShe may be a forgotten star now but her credits are astounding as you will see.\n\nHere is an vintage article from Blue Book of the Screen (1923) about Marie when her star was only beginning to shine:\n\nLIKE the Florodora girls, the original Sennett bathing girls not only became famous in the public eye, but several of them wafted to stardom and made good indeed. One of these was Marie Prevost, today a leading lady in special screen production.\n\nShe was born in Sarnia, Canada, November 8th, about twenty-two years ago. Brought up in a home of plenty, she was given the best education which money could provide. She was sent to the Laurette Sisters at Denver, St. Mary's in Los Angeles, and the Glen Taylor at Alameda, Calif.\n\nThen she proceeded to enjoy the out-of-door life in \"the land of sunshine.\" Her introduction to pictures occurred in 1917, when a girl friend took her to the Sennett studio on a visit. Ford Sterling, who was directing a comedy, asked the girls to enter the crowd as \"atmosphere.\" Later, when she was asked to take a role in \"East Lynne With Variations,\" she accepted and, in a short time was playing featured parts with Keystone.\n\nBeing a lively outdoor girl, an expert swimmer and rider, she achieved a name as a \"bathing beauty\" during this period. While with the Sennett organization she played prominent roles in the following: \"Yankee Doodle in Berlin,\" a six-reel special; \"Sleuths,\" \"Reilly's Wash Day,\" \"When Love Is Blind,\" \"Love's False Faces,\" \"The Dentist,\" \"Uncle Tom With a Cabin,\" \"The Speak-Easy\" and \"Down on the Farm.\" She achieved drama later when she was starred by Universal. Important among these features were: \"Nobody's Fool,\" \"Don't Get Personal\" and \"The Butterfly.\"\n\nFollowing this engagement, Miss Prevost was called into the \"special\" field, one of her greater roles being that of \"Marjorie Jones,\" the feminine lead in the production, \"Brass,\" at Warners' studio.\n\nHer recent success was in F.

Marie broke into films when she was 18 years old in the production of UNTO THOSE WHO SIN (1916). Finding work in film was difficult in the early days, just as it is today. Marie found herself in odd jobs until 1917 when she found herself in another film entitled SECRETS OF A BEAUTY PARLOR. After filming was completed, Marie found herself unemployed in the movie world and went back scrapping for a living. She continued on casting calls, but it wasn't until 1919 when she played a role in UNCLE TOM WITHOUT A CABIN. Finally, in 1921, movie moguls discovered her talent and began casting her in a number of roles. She appeared in four films that year and an additional six in 1922. Marie seemed to be on a roll. She stayed busy through the balance of the twenties in a number of films, mostly comedies. As a matter of fact, she would continue making films until 1933, when her appeal began to dwindle. No work found her in 1934 and precious few after that. With the advent of sound, Marie's thick New England accent didn't lend itself well to the \"demon microphone\", despite her beauty. Turning to alcohol, to drown her depression, Marie died on January 23, 1937 in Hollywood, California, virtually broke and living in a dilapidated apartment. She never saw the release, in 1938, of her final appearance on celluloid, that being TEN LAPS TO GO. She was 38 years old.\n\nso sad...\n\nPopular star in Hollywood for two decades through 1936. Began as a Mack Sennett \"Bathing Beauty\" in 1917, later starring in dozens of light comedies. But not long into the sound era, she would have encountered problems with her burgeoning weight, to the jeopardy of her career. Her self-remedy resulted ultimately in her starving to death.\n\nSpouse\n\nKenneth Harlan (1924 - 1927) (divorced)\n\nTrivia\n\nSister of actress Peggy Prevost.\n\nPossibly most famous for being the subject of a Nick Lowe song, \"Marie Provost\" (sic).\n\nHer death was not discoved until after neighbors had complained about incessant barking by her little dachshund.\n\nDied from a combination of acute alcholism and extreme malnutrition.

Marie Prevost and\n\nKenneth Harlan admit they are going to be married, but when and\n\nwhere they refuse to divulge to their closest intimates.\"\n\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Mary Bickford Dunn in Sarnia, Ontario, when still a child her family moved first to Denver, Colorado and then later to Los Angeles, California. While working as a secretary, she applied and obtained an acting job at the Hollywood studio owned by Mack Sennett. Himself from a small Canadian town outside of Montreal, Sennett dubbed her as the exotic French girl, adding Mary Dunn to his collection of bathing beauties under the stage name of Marie Prevost.\n\n[edit]\n\nCareer Rise\n\nOne of her first publicly successful film roles came in the 1920 romantic film Love, Honor, and Behave opposite another newcomer and Sennett protegé, George O'Hara. Initially cast in numerous minor comedic roles as the sexy, innocent young girl, she worked in several films for Sennett's studio until 1921 when she signed with Universal Studios. At Universal, Marie Prevost was still relegated to light comedies and after making only eight films she left to sign with Warner Brothers in 1922.\n\nIt was there that she got her first big break appearing in a standout role in the F. Scott Fitzgerald story, The Beautiful and Damned. Her performance brought good reviews and director Ernst Lubitsch chose her for a major role opposite Adolphe Menjou in 1924's The Marriage Circle. Of her performance as the beautiful seductress, Ernst Lubitsch said that she was one of the few actresses in Hollywood who knew how to underplay comedy to achieve the maximum effect.\n\nThis impressive performance, praised by the New York Times, resulted in Lubitsch casting her in Three Women in 1924 and in Kiss Me Again the following year. But, just when her career was blossoming, tragedy struck her family again in 1926. While her mother was traveling in Florida with actress Vera Steadman and another Canadian friend, Hollywood studio owner, Al Christie, an automobile accident took her mother's life.\n\n[edit]\n\nDecline\n\nDevastated, the loss of her only remaining parent led to an addiction to alcohol and to Marie Prevost's own ultimate destruction. Married to actor Kenneth Harlan since 1924, that marriage soon ended in a 1927 divorced.\n\nPrevost tried to get past her personal torment by burying herself in her work, becoming one of the busiest actresses of the day, starring in numerous roles as the temptingly beautiful seductress who in the end was always the honorable heroine.\n\nHowever, her depression caused her to binge on food resulting in significant weight gain. By the 1930s she was working less and less being offered only secondary parts, frequently in humiliating roles as a cheap-talking floozy, such as 1930's Sam Wood directed prison-flick Paid where Prevost took second-billing to Joan Crawford.\n\nAs a result of all this, her financial income declined and her growing dependency on alcohol added to her weight problems. By 1934, she had no work at all and her financial situation deteriorated dramatically. The downward spiral became greatly aggravated when her weight problems forced her into repeated crash dieting in order to keep whatever bit part a movie studio offered.\n\nAt the age of 38, secluded and hiding away from the world, living alone in an apartment house, Marie Prevost died from a combination of alcoholism and her self-imposed malnutrition. Her body was not discovered for days, and the police report stated that her pet dachshund \"had chewed up her arms and legs in a futile attempt to awaken her.\" Her pauper's burial place is unknown to this day.\n\nAfter having performed in 105 films Marie Prevost has now been honored with a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6201 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nOn his 1978 album \"Jesus of Cool,\" released in the US as \"Pure Pop for Now People,\" British rocker Nick Lowe related Marie Prevost's sad tale in the song \"Marie Provost,\" a bouncy little ditty with rather gruesome lyrics. Along with changing her last name slightly, the song has Marie coming from New York instead of Canada. It includes the immortal line \"She was a winner that became the doggie's dinner.\" The line comes from the caption of a photo of Prevost's corpse in situ (with dog bites) published in Kenneth Anger's exposé Hollywood Babylon. The book is also the source of Lowe's erroneous biographical information on Prevost."
