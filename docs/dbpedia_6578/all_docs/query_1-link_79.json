        "text": "Death of a Ghost Hunter is a low budget Horror Film that came out in 2007. The cast is primarily made up of unknown actors but the actress Patti Tindall, who plays the lead Carter Simms, does a great job. The rest of the cast are actors that may someday be seen in more films, or in the case of actor Mike Marsh, writing them.\n\nThe film opens with a story about how a family was murdered and then we see what appears to be an old film showing us what happened the night in question. There is a woman in white walking with a bloody knife, dragging a garbage bag, before washing her hands, placing the knife in the block and then shooting herself.\n\nWe then are informed how a renowned Ghost Hunter, Carter Simms, has been hired for $5000 to investigate the home by its current owner. It appears the home hasn’t seen many occupants since the murder and a caretaker had a terrible experience there. Carter takes the assignment and is told that she will have some people working with her. Carter is told that a writer and a videographer will be joining her during her investigation. Although Carter prefers to work alone, she accepts this fact as she is getting $5000 to investigate. There is one problem though, when the first night of the investigation begins, an additional person shows up saying she has been asked to assist the investigation as well.\n\nThe film moves along as we watch the Ghost Hunter meet with her team and plan her investigation. This is a great part of the film as we get to see the thought process and planning that goes into her investigation. This is something that is shown other times during the film and includes the use of a white board in the process. This shows almost a methodical police like plan of action to solve a crime and as the film progresses it appears that they just maybe solving a crime.\n\nDeath of a Ghost Hunter is a film that is somewhat unique in its telling. It takes time to show the process used in the investigation. There are points of conflict that come from the unexpected guest, but this adds to some tension in the film. As things start to get more interesting in the investigation and the bumps in the night become more real, the film really starts to break out to being a chilling tale. There is plenty to keep the viewer on edge and keep a person nervous and scared.\n\nThe acting in the film can be a bit off at times, but if you can let yourself get past that, you will find a great film. The way the film helps the viewer to uncover what happened that fateful night when the family was murdered is greatly done and you may find yourself trying to guess what happened. The film is certainly something worth viewing. The interaction of the characters, the plot, and the visuals used in the film are extraordinary considering its possible budget. Paranormal, thriller, suspense, and horror fans will enjoy this movie if they are willing to give it a shot."
