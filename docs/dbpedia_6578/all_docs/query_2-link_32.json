        "text": "BY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nAs with any major film star who dies young, Jean Seberg has become a cult of personality to some film fans, partly due to the fact that she died in Paris from an overdose of barbiturates at age 40 in 1979. Her death was ruled a suicide but conspiracy theories still abound because she was deemed a political radical by the FBI due to her association with far left wing causes and her support of the Black Panther party. On screen, however, Seberg's characters were generally not radical, although her breakthrough film did find her as the female lead in Godard's classic 1960 crime flick Breathless. Still, there were some hints of Seberg's liberated woman persona in her early career. One such film was In the French Style, a largely forgotten 1963 production based on Irwin Shaw's novel. Shaw wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by Robert Parrish, a respected veteran of the movie industry who never enjoyed a career-defining major hit. (The closest he came was directing segments of the bloated 1967 spoof version of Casino Royale.) The movie opens in Paris with Seberg as Christina James, a 19 year old free spirited girl from Chicago who has come to the City of Light to hone her skills as a painter. In the process of trying to acclimate herself to the metropolitan lifestyle, she meets Guy ((Philippe Forquet), a headstrong, sometimes arrogant 21 year-old who is nonetheless charismatic and quite handsome. He woos Christina and before long, they are a couple swept up in a whirlwind romance. However, it isn't long before there are strains due in part to their impoverished lifestyle. Guy, being a typical guy, tries to get Christina into bed, but she says when it happens, it will be on her terms and conditions. When the big moment arises, Guy's romantic evening turns into a disaster because he only has enough money to rent a room at a flophouse hotel without heat. In the course of the strained evening, Guy confesses to Christina that he cannot perform sexually because he is too nervous. He makes a shocking confession: he is actually a 16 year old high school boy and a virgin at that. While this does bring the story into a completely unexpected direction, it's the one element of the film that strains credibility largely due to the fact that Forquet was actually 23 years old at the time and looks it. Nevertheless, this plot device takes us away from what was shaping up as a conventional \"boy meets girl\" romance and plunges the viewer into unknown waters.\n\nThe story then jumps ahead in time and we find Christina now in her early twenties and very much in step with the Parisian lifestyle. She is the toast of her neighborhood's social scene and the belle of the ball in terms of attracting male suitors. In a rather progressive depiction of a single woman for the year 1963, it is made abundantly clear that Christina has her pick of lovers and routinely engages in short-term sexual affairs. Every time she meets the \"right man\", it turns out that differences in their lifestyles prevent them from enjoying a traditional relationship. Her father (very well played by Addison Powell) visits her from Chicago and, again Shaw's script goes against the conventional depiction of father and daughter relationships generally seen in movies during this era. Instead of being a square old fuddy duddy, Dad is actually amused by his daughter's somewhat hedonistic lifestyle and he asks her how many lovers she has had. \"A couple\", she replies, but it becomes clear that both of them regard that as a drastic understatement. When her father asks to see the paintings she has been working on for years, he gently informs her that they are below the quality he had expected. He cautions her that her party-filled lifestyle may be compromising her potential. Christina objects and two part company under a strain, but it becomes clear that her father's words have resonated with her and that it might be time to develop plans for a more productive career path.\n\nAll of that changes when she has a chance encounter with Walter Beddoes (Stanley Baker), a hard-drinking international newspaper journalist. They enjoy a torrid affair and fall in love but, alas, fate rears its ugly head once again when Walter's requirements to travel extensively takes him away from Christina for months at a time. He confesses to her that, while abroad \"I don't live like a monk\". Christina says she accepts that he will have other lovers but makes it clear that she will, too. Such behavior from a young couple was rarely depicted so honestly on screen in 1963, an era in which sexually assertive women were generally painted as floozies. By the time Walter returns from a three month stint in Africa, he finds Christina has a new boyfriend, an American doctor from San Francisco (James Leo Herlihy), who she says she intends to marry. She has a civilized lunch with both men, as Walter tries to persuade her to resume her affair with him. She confesses that she has seen her share of former lovers ultimately drop her to marry the girl of her dreams, a status she somehow never attains in their eyes. This climactic sequence left me a bit disappointed because in the end, Christina- that most liberated of young women- decides to throw in the towel to become a doctor's wife and live in San Francisco. However, director Parrish does afford us the nagging possibility that she knows she is selling out by doing so.\n\nIn the French Style is a very worthwhile experience. The Parisian locations add immeasurably to its pleasures and the crisp B&W cinematography Michel Kelber is impressive, as is the Joseph Kosma's atmospheric score. Not much happens dramatically in the film. You keep waiting for some earth-shaking development to emerge but it never does. However, that's part of the movie's charm. It recalls an era in which studios routinely backed small films with fine actors (they are all wonderful here) and gave them intelligent dialogue and direction.\n\nTwilight Time has issued an impressive limited edition (3,000) Blu-ray edition that does justice to the fine B&W cinematography. The bonus extras include an isolated score track, informative commentary by film historians Lem Dobbs, Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman, a theatrical trailer and a collector's booklet with liner notes by Kirgo.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER TWILIGHT TIME BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER SONY BASIC DVD EDITION FROM THE CINEMA RETRO MOVIE STORE\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nSome of the best private eye thrillers tend to be complex and sometimes incomprehensible affairs. Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\", for example, had a plot that could not be comprehended even by the people who made the film, but it ranks as one of the great movies in the crime genre. Similarly, director Arthur Penn's 1975 mystery \"Night Moves\" (the title is- appropriately enough- a metaphor) sat on a shelf for over a year before it went into general release, only to be greeted by an apathetic public. There were some prescient critics like Roger Ebert who foresaw the film's enduring qualities but, for the most part, \"Night Moves\" didn't get much attention in a year in which the likes of great films like \"Jaws\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and \"Barry Lyndon\" were in release. The movie began to gain steam over the decades with the critical establishment and is now considered to be a classic by many, thus its arrival on Blu-ray from the Warner Archive is much appreciated by retro movie lovers.\n\nThe film reunited Gene Hackman with Arthur Penn after their triumphant work on \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967). Hackman was a supporting character in that film but received an Oscar nomination. In \"Night Moves\" he is the front-and-center star, in almost every scene and he dominates the movie with a superb, laid-back performance that is so natural that it reminds us of how Hackman's genius was to make you think you are watching a real-life person. He plays Harry Moseby, an L.A. private eye who isn't down-and-out like most of his cinematic counterparts, but is not setting the world on fire, either. He's a complex man haunted by bad childhood memories and he's got some contemporary problems, as well. His wife Ellen (Susan Clark) is bored and frustrated that Harry is too remote and spends far too much of his time on low-paying cases. He catches her having an affair but it's clear her lover (Harris Yulin) is more of a distraction than a passion. While Harry is trying to reconcile with Ellen, he's hired by Arlene Iverson (Janet Ward), a one-time minor starlet with a knack for marrying rich men. She wants Harry to find her wayward, runaway 16 year-old daughter Delly (Melanie Griffith), with whom she has a terrible relationship. Seems Arlene is dependent upon the funds from a trust that her late husband set up for Delly. As long as Arlene lives with the girl, she can continue residing in a mansion and enjoy a lavish lifestyle. However, once Delly turns 25, the spigot is turned off and Delly gets control of her fortune. The case leads Harry to the Florida Keys where Delly's stepfather, Tom Iverson (John Crawford) (divorced from Arlene) runs a charting plane service. He's surrounded by plenty of unsavory types, some of whom are employed as stuntmen in the movie business. At least two of them- Marv Ellman (Anthony Costello) and Quentin (James Woods)- have had sexual flings with the free-spirited Delly. Harry discovers Delly living openly with Tom Iverson and she resents having to be brought back to L.A. by Harry. She tells him her mother only views her as a source of income. While at Tom's place, Harry also becomes involved with another female with a troubled past, Paula (Jennifer Warren), who had once been both a stripper and a hooker before latching onto Tom and helping him with the plane charter business.She speaks in riddles and her dialogue with Harry is marvelously coy. (When she asks him where he was when Kennedy was assassinated, he replies \"Which Kennedy\"?).\n\nAlan Sharp's terrific screenplay is witty and complex and chances are that when some of the mysteries are resolved, you'll end up scratching your head wondering what it all meant. \"Night Moves\" is a film that requires a few viewings before it all makes sense but that's part of the delight in seeing it for the first time. The dialogue crackles with bon mots and there are numerous intriguing sub-plots that sometimes overshadow Harry's primary mission, which, it turns out is explained in part by a MacGuffin. Hackman is superb, as is Arthur Penn's direction. The film has a moody, menacing atmosphere throughout, aided considerably by Bruce Surtees' typically dark cinematography. The supporting cast is letter-perfect with Jennifer Warren outstanding in an early screen role (she should have become a much bigger star, though she has found success as a director.) Also seen in an early role, James Woods impresses substantially in his limited screen time. Susan Clark (long underrated as an actress) is very good indeed, as is veteran character actor Edward Binns and Janet Ward. Young Melanie Griffith also impresses, though, ironically she played essentially the same role in another gumshoe flick that same year, \"The Drowning Pool\". I also admired the jazzy score by Michael Small. The finale of the film is most memorable. It's not only suspenseful and exciting but also intriguingly ambiguous with Harry on a boat literally spinning in circles, as the viewer may well be in terms of comprehending what has just occurred.\n\nBecause the original film elements of \"Night Moves\" were in decline, the Warner Archive spent a good time of time and money to restore the movie to its initial grandeur. The results paid off with an excellent transfer that does justice to Penn's artistic vision. Kudos to all involved. There are also some bonus extras: an original trailer and a vintage featurette, \"The Day of the Director\" that provides some very good behind-the-scenes footage of the movie in production. However, the Blu-ray cries out for an audio commentary to allow analysis of the film's many complex aspects. Perhaps a future release will include one. For now, this is a \"must-have\" for your video library.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM THE CINEMA RETRO MOVIE STORE\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nI've long had admiration for the work of actor Robert Shaw ever since he impressed me at age 8 with his chilling interpretation of the SPECTRE psychotic killer Red Grant in \"From Russia With Love\". Shaw could always be counted on to deliver a fine performance even if the material he chose was sometimes underwhelming. Shaw was also a talented writer and playwright, having won acclaim for his play \"The Man in the Glass Booth\", which was inspired by the war criminal trial of Adolf Eichmann. Shaw, like many actors, participated in many questionable films in order to enable his real passion, which was to bring avante garde movie projects to fruition, even if they only appealed to the art cinema crowd. One of Shaw's most interesting vehicles is one of his least seen. \"Figures in a Landscape\" was his 1970 adaptation of an allegorical novel by Barry England that abounded with reference to the (then) on-going Vietnam war. Shaw dispensed with that aspect of the novel and instead played up its more opaque aspects, particularly those that concern the two protagonists in what is basically a two-character adventure. The film opens with Shaw and co-star Malcolm McDowell on the run in an unnamed country being pursued by unnamed forces (presumably the police and/or military) for unspecified crimes. One senses they are political prisoners in a totalitarian state but this is never addressed directly. Shaw is MacConnachie (\"Mac\"), a middle-aged man with a colorful past that often found him on the opposite side of the law. McDowell is Ansell, a twenty-something free spirited type from London whose social values are the polar opposite of Mac's old fashioned values. When we first see the men, they are running at a high rate of speed and have to contend with the major obstacle of having their hands bound behind their backs. We never learn how they effected their escape and from whom but these are just several key questions that Shaw's screenplay goes to lengths in terms of not filling in the audience on the details. The two men, bound by their mutual need for one another, bicker and bark at each other like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in \"The Defiant Ones\" with Mac channeling his future performance as Quint in \"Jaws\" by constantly attacking the younger man for being the product of a soft generation. As these types of films generally play out, Mac and Ansell are able to win some small victories through mutual efforts and begin to develop a grudging but sincere admiration for each other. (In one of the script's few instances of humor, we learn that Mac is somewhat of a prude by the way he chastises the younger generation for the sexual promiscuity afforded by \"The Pill\".) They finally figure out a way to free their bonds and obtain food, water and arms. However, they find themselves relentlessly pursued by a helicopter piloted by faceless, nameless men who coordinate a widespread army of pursuers on the ground The image of the helicopter haunts Mac and Ansell throughout their desperate race across a harsh landscape that contains both deserts and high, snow-covered mountains. Throughout their ordeal, the men come to know each other better though Shaw's screenplay, perhaps not coincidentally, gives his character far meatier material than McDowell gets to work with. Shaw is at his best in the quiet sequences, reminiscing about his beloved wife who waits for his return home.\n\nThe film falls short of its Kafkaesque pretensions but is never less than engaging, thanks in no small part to the skill of director Joseph Losey in keeping the bizarre aspects of the scripts from becoming too alienating for the audience. There is also superb cinematography that does justice to the magnificent, if sometimes foreboding, Spanish landscapes and a fine score by the estimable Richard Rodney Bennett. It's unclear what Shaw was trying to say in this sometimes puzzling film that at times evokes aspects of Patrick McGoohan's classic TV series \"The Prisoner\". This jumbled aspect of the story robs the film of some of its potential dramatic payoffs but there is real satisfaction in watching Shaw and McDowell in parts that are this meaty. We only learn enough about each character to tantalize us even further regarding how they ended up in this dilemma and it's probably best that Shaw never provides any easy answers. However, some of the men's actions and interactions cry out for a bit more clarification especially in the exciting climax when Mac is motivated to take on downing the hated helicopter even at an unnecessary risk to his own life.\n\n\"Figures in a Landscape\" has been released by Kino Lorber on Blu-ray. As with most of the company's titles, this one boasts a superb transfer that does justice to the impressive filming locations. Unfortunately, no extras are included. A pity because this film cries out for a commentary track that could have covered not only the movie itself but also Shaw's remarkable career, one that never completely fulfilled its potential because of his own personal demons.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY MARK LAGER\n\nThe times they were a-changinâ€™ in the 1960s. Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s Psycho did not feature a foreign monster (no Dracula vampire with an Eastern European accent or Cold War alien creatures or Japanese Godzilla.) The audience follows the main character (played by Janet Leigh) to an American motel where the caretaker Norman Bates appears to be a mild-mannered young man. Then he stabs the main character to death in a shower. The camera slowly zooms out of the eye of the beautiful young womanâ€™s corpse. Norman Bates was inspired by the real-life serial killer Ed Gein, who committed two ghastly and grisly crimes in Wisconsin in the 1950s. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 traumatized the nation and the race riots in 1964 and 1965 showed a conflict and crisis in American society that could no longer be ignored. After midnight, on August 1, 1966 in Austin,, twenty-five year old Charles Whitman stabbed his mother and wife and then shortly before high noon he climbed the stairs of the clock tower at the University of Texas campus and murdered multiple victims by firing at them with his sniper rifle until he was shot by police officers.\n\nTwenty-eight year old Peter Bogdanovich had been obsessed with cinema his entire life. He wrote film criticism for various magazines and had also been a movie programmer at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He had left NYC for L.A. because he no longer wanted to only write about films. He wanted to be a director. Yet it was his writing that gave him his first directing job. Roger Corman had read an article Peter Bogdanovich had written for Esquire, and the two of them discussed filmmaking when they met at a screening. Corman gave Bogdanovich complete creative control over his directorial debut, with one exception. He had to use the actor Boris Karloff and footage from the film The Terror. Bogdanovich had been deeply disturbed by Charles Whitmanâ€™s mass shooting and felt compelled to write a screenplay based on the event. How would he incorporate Boris Karloff into this story? Karloff had been the iconic face of horror in Hollywood history. His foreign facial features and voice had frightened American audiences. The 1930s - 1950s was an era when Americaâ€™s deepest fears were of foreign enemies. The 1960s altered audiencesâ€™ views. Lee Harvey Oswald was American. Charles Whitman was American. The enemy was no longer foreign. The enemy was within American society.\n\nBogdanovich named his directorial debut with the stark title Targets. He co-wrote the screenplay with his wife Polly Platt. He was against his directorial debut being released by American International Pictures. Bogdanovich wanted it to be distributed by a company with historical significance. He sold the movie to Paramount. They had Boris Karloff for five days and a shooting schedule of twenty-three days. They juxtaposed two plotlines. In the first plotline, Boris Karloff plays Byron Orlok (a nod to Nosferatu), an aging horror movie star who wants to retire, which outrages the company who want him to make more films. Karloff was seventy-nine years old when production on Targets started in 1967. He felt rejuvenated by the opportunity to play a character that was a deviation from his usual appearances in the horror genre. This was a character that had nuances and was realistic. Karloffâ€™s performance is wistful and wry, which fits his character who is reflecting on the course of his career. Bogdanovichâ€™s performance is appropriately anxious and nervous as he plays himself, a cinephile who has suddenly been thrown into the management position of his first major motion picture. Bogdanovich plays (Sammy Michaels), a young director who is both optimistic about Orlok (he believes the script he has written will be Orlokâ€™s best and most complex character) and skeptical about the state of the movie business (â€œAll the good movies have been made.â€) Bogdanovich had a high opinion of Karloff and was nostalgic for Old Hollywood. This becomes clear in several scenes. Karloff and Bogdanovich watch a sinister scene together from The Criminal Code and Bogdanovich praises his performance. Bogdanovich and the hippie radio DJs (whom he satirizes as absolutely absurd in their lack of serious questions for Karloff) gather around and listen to Karloffâ€™s hypnotic, mesmerizing voice as he recites the ancient fable of the Appointment in Samarra which symbolizes the inescapability of death. This fable doubles as an epitaph for Karloffâ€™s career (Targets was his last major role in an American film) and as a commentary on the mass shootings in American society. Bogdanovich also uses dialogue he wrote for Karloff as a commentary on the changing attitude to the horror genre (â€œYou know what they call my films today? Camp! High camp!â€) and on Bogdanovichâ€™s own perspective of Hollywood and L.A. in the 1960s (â€œwhat an ugly town this has become.â€)\n\nRETRO-ACTIVE: THE BEST FROM THE CINEMA RETRO ARCHIVES.\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nLeni Riefenstahl's \"Triumph of the Will\" has long posed a conundrum for film critics and historians. How do you assess a film that is brilliantly made but which promotes a hateful message? The 1934 production which was created as a love letter to Adolf Hitler and his rapidly-rising National Socialist movement has been relatively shunned at film festivals and the art house circuit over the decades. It's undoubtedly been most widely seen in classrooms and on home video. Yet the passing of time has allowed the film to be more actively shown in recent years and it is nearly always accompanied by an introduction that rightly explains its relevance both to the period in which it was made but also as it pertains to today's world. Director Riefenstahl had been a popular actress in German cinema who had caught the eye of Adolf Hitler, who was quite the movie fan (his favorites included \"Gone With the Wind\" and Laurel and Hardy.) Riefenstahl had recently become a pioneer as one of the first women to enter directing in the era of sound films. Hitler commissioned her to film the Nazi party's annual meeting in Nuremberg in the expectation that it would bolster the movement as well as increase the fanatical cult of personality that was already attached to him. Hitler had tried to overthrow the German government a decade earlier but ended up in jail. He turned this to his advantage by becoming a martyr to the cause and writing his personal bible Mein Kampf from his jail cell. By the time he was released, even those who had prosecuted him were trying to curry favor with the future dictator. Hitler ran for office and won the election to become Germany's chancellor. In reality he had most of the political power but was prudent enough to bide his time until the ceremonial head of state, Von Hindenburg, passed away from natural causes. Hitler knew that the public would not abide him disrespecting the beloved Von Hindenburg, who was regarded as a national war hero.As it had so many times in these early days of Hitler's rise, fate cooperated with his interests. Von Hindenburg passed away and Hitler went full throttle to establish himself as a virtual dictator. His first order of business was to eradicate Germany's fragile hold on democracy, first attacking the free press and then nationalizing it as a propaganda arm. The nation had come out on the losing side in WWI and was suffering terribly from onerous war reparations that had to be paid to the Allies, who were basically using Germany as a cash cow. Hitler quickly put to rest the last remnants of the loathed Weimar Republic and combined the offices of chancellor and president, thus giving himself unchallenged power over the country. He then persuaded the Reichstag to voluntarily cede most of their powers to him, thus making the series of checks and balances in the government a rubber stamp for Hitler's policies. Hitler still had important goals to fulfill. It was important to mobilize the nation as a fighting force in the expectation of war. However, he was bound by the Treaty of Versailles which mandated that Germany's armed forces number no more than 100,000 men. Hitler got around this by organizing numerous civic and political groups and turning them into paramilitary organizations. In this way he was able to train millions of Germans as soldiers even if they carried picks and shovels instead of rifles. Hitler also did some controversial \"house cleaning\" within his party by personally ordering the murders of SA head Ernst Rohm and his top lieutenants. The SA was Hitler's personal bodyguard but had grown to the size of an army. He worried that Rohm had political aspirations of his own and that he might orchestrate a coup. On the so-called Night of the Long Knives, the top echelon of the SA was systematically executed. Hitler appointed a more benign stooge, Viktor Lutze, as the new head of the SA. Hitler's biggest challenge was to ensure that he and Lutze could convince the rank and file SA men to stay loyal to the party and Hitler himself. This he intended to do at the Nuremberg rally, where he would give speech extolling his appreciation of the SA. The ploy worked and any dissension never spilled over into a threat to Hitler.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will\" presents a sanitized picture of all these dastardly goings-on. What emerges is a nation that is completely behind Hitler and the Nazi cause. This was nonsense, of course. There were countless people who opposed the regime and over the course of the next few years they would pay dearly for their protests against the demise of German democracy. Nevertheless, as a propaganda piece the film is probably unrivaled in its impact. Although the movie was shown internationally, it didn't quite have the alarming impact one might have assumed. The Western democracies still thought of Hitler as primarily a quirky crank whose influence would be confined within Germany's borders. Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels was a master of using cinema as a tool of manipulation. Not wanting to alarm the Allies before Germany had been rebuilt militarily, the film was given rather non-threatening sub-titles to accommodate its international showings. Meanwhile, within Germany, the messages were more ominous. When viewing the film even today one gets the feeling that Germany was an invincible power. One can only imagine the trepidation Allied troops must have felt when they finally had to go up against what had become a seemingly unstoppable war machine. The clues were in the film. The legions of robot-like paramilitary adherents are presented as fanatical loyalists to the new dictator. In fact the \"real\" armed forces were featured so slightly in the film that they raised protests. To appease them, Hitler commissioned a second film by Riefehstahl titled \"Day of Freedom\" (also included in this set). The movie has her trademark use of imaginary camera angles but it amounts to basically a sop to the armed forces by showcasing their prowess through military training exercises. More powerful are the scenes in \"Triumph of the Will\" that carefully showcase Hitler as a demi-god. He is seen traveling to Nuremberg by the small plane he favored for use in his political campaign stops. (Hitler was the first politician to eschew the traditional whistle stop train tours in favor of using a plane in order to cover more territory.) The images of his plane flying through the spectacular cloud formations are truly stunning. We also watch him as he stares down at the massive rally forming in expectation of his arrival. When Hitler does arrive at the rally he is preceded by a small army of his top officials who were being formally introduced to the German people through this film. In retrospect, they formed the perfect \"Rogue's Gallery\" and would go on to perpetrate some of the most heinous crimes of the 20th century. Most paid for their sins with their lives though others were sentenced to jail terms in the aftermath of the war. When Hitler takes to the podium he uses his trademark practice of starting his speech in a low voice but gradually rising in tone and emotion into a virtual scream. The most disturbing part of the film occurs when all of the countless thousands of participants march past the podium and pledge their loyalty, not to Germany, but to Hitler personally. The film then concentrates on the ancillary fanfare that took place during this seminal week in the nation's history as we watch torchlight parades march past Hitler's hotel balcony where he looks on approvingly. At all times Riefenstahl diminishes the notion of individualism in order to present Hitler in an almost superhuman manner. He is photographed from angles that make him seem literally larger than life.\n\nThe Synapse Blu-ray, which features a restoration by Robert A. Harris, contains some valuable extras, the most informative being a feature-length commentary track by Dr. Anthony R. Santoro, an expert on German history. Santoro's calm, laid-back manner is somewhat jolting at times, given the gravity of what we are viewing, but he provides excellent information regarding the nuances of these scenes and the fate of the individual Nazi top brass.Where the track falls a bit short is in Santoro's discussions of Riefenstahl and her legacy. He acknowledges her talents as a director but doesn't put much meat on the bone in regard to her personal life and legacy. (She lived until the age of 101 and never fully repented for her association with Hitler, nor was she ever prosecuted. She would defensively point out that she never actually joined the Nazi party, which is indeed surprising.) She would go on to make another important propaganda film for Hitler in 1938, \"Olympiad\", an equally whitewashed account of the 1936 Olympics that were held in Berlin and which also managed to elevate Hitler as a star attraction even though he was largely a bystander. Arguably, \"Olympiad\" was the more important and effective film as it was meant to appease foreign concerns about the atrocities that were just being implemented in Germany. Some of the slack from the commentary is addressed in excellent liner notes written by director and film historian Roy Frumkes, who delves deeper into Riefenstahl's fascinating life. Frumkes points out that the film should not really be considered a documentary because many of the \"spontaneous\" scenes were staged by Riefenstahl and some were shot repeatedly in order to get the desired footage. The new 2K restoration is impressive on all counts and does justice to Riefenstahl's astonishing camera angles. This presentation also boasts newly interpreted English sub-titles that accommodate the film's original German language version. It's beneficial to watch the film first then view it again with Dr. Santoro's commentary to provide context.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will\" is indeed a major cinematic achievement- but tragically it promoted the greatest evil of the 20th century. The mind reels at what Leni Riefenstahl could have achieved had she not been compromised by her political beliefs. More importantly, the movie clearly illustrates that democracies are fragile states that can deconstruct under the influence and spell of one man.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nIn the days before the home video revolution made its way into my family, the only way to see a movie on television was to either watch it when it was aired or beg my grandmother to ask her brother to record it for me on his $1200 Magnavox video tape recorder. Just before Halloween in 1983, she told me of a movie that she had seen in a local theater in 1954 called The Maze, which starred one of her favorite actors, Richard Carlson. Channel 5 in New York was showing it at 2:30 am and we later viewed it at her brotherâ€™s house on VHS. I recall a TV trailer for Andrzej Zulawskiâ€™s Possession airing during the commercial break, oblivious that it would become one of my favorite horror movies seven years later.\n\nThe Maze, which was released in 3-D in July 1953 and played at the RKO Albee Theater in Brooklyn, NY with William Beaudineâ€™s Roar of the Crowd with Howard Duff of all things, has all of the charms that one associates with B-movies of the 1950s. After a brief 1979 theatrical re-release of The Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954) in 3-D, the format was experiencing a resurgence at the box office beginning in the early 1980s with Ferdinando Baldiâ€™s Cominâ€™ at Ya!, which I was so disappointed to see was rated R! The Maze is a film that lacks action, something that was all too familiar in the 3-D resurgence and exactly what you want from the format. There is a lot of talking and discussions up until the very end, and this review contains spoilers regarding the very ridiculous denouement, so youâ€™ve been warned!\n\nRichard Carlson plays a Scotsman with no Scottish accent named Gerald MacTeam on vacation in Cannes. Heâ€™s engaged to his girlfriend Kitty (Veronica Hurst) and the pair seem perfectly happy until he receives a letter from William, his Uncle Samuelâ€™s butler, informing him of his uncle having taken sick. Despite not having a relationship with his uncle (a Baronet), Gerald feels a moral obligation to go to his side and pushes aside his initial reluctance to help. Uncle Samuel resides in the foreboding Craven Castle, a stately manor bereft of modern conveniences such as electricity or telephones and it isnâ€™t long before he passes away, his obituary capturing Kittyâ€™s eye despite no communication from Gerald. Kitty is perplexed by his silence until he writes her some weeks later, â€œreleasingâ€ her from the engagement.\n\nKitty and her aunt make their way to the castle and Gerald is unsurprisingly distressed to see them both. He also looks like heâ€™s aged fifteen years and is unceremoniously aloof. Kitty and her aunt stay the night, and Kitty discovers a hidden passage (remember the hidden room in 1979â€™s The Changeling?) that leads to a lookout tower which reveals a hedge maze in the rear of the castle (think 1980â€™s The Shining) and detects strange noises and movement in the middle of the night. The remainder of the film attempts to keep this secret from the audience and when its revealed to eyes 66 years hence, itâ€™s difficult not to laugh. The â€œsecretâ€ is a frog-like monster who used to be the castleâ€™s master and meets an untimely death following a horrific illness. In the end, Gerald is able to return to a normal existence.\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nDespite having been a major star for decades and having a lead a life of controversy and personal obstacles and challenges, it seems surprising that there has never been a book about the films of Anthony Perkins that examined his work in detail. That dilemma has finally been resolved with the release of \"More Than a Psycho: The Complete Films of Anthony Perkins\" by husband-and-wife writing team of Dawn and Jonathon Dabell. The authors refreshingly concentrate on examining each of the actor's individual feature films and TV productions in detail, offering fascinating background information and astute evaluations of each title from classics such as \"Friendly Persuasion\" and \"Murder on the Orient Express\" to television fare such as \"How Awful About Alan\" There is a biographical section, to be sure, that provides meaningful details on Perkins' life and career but the primary emphasis is on the quality of his individual films. In this regard the book resembles those marvelous old Citadel Press \"Films of...\" titles that still adorn the bookshelves and libraries of movie lovers worldwide. The book is also profusely illustrated.\n\nThe Dabells succeed in their quest to prove that Perkins should be judged by other achievements that just his signature role as Norman Bates in \"Psycho\" but it's not without irony that the role that stereotyped him to a degree was one he would return to many years later to exploit in sequels based on Hitchcock's original premise. The book makes it clear that, for the most part, Perkins' considerable talents were generally under-utilized by the film industry. He would occasionally land a supporting role in an \"A\" list feature film but more of than not he top-lined a good deal of mediocre fare. Nevertheless, he always gave it his best effort and this very worthy book pays homage to his impressive achievements.\n\nHere is an official announcement about the release of the book:\n\nAnthony Perkins is best known for playing Norman Bates in Psycho. Its notoriety and success ensured he remained one of filmdomâ€™s most recognisable faces for the rest of his lifeâ€¦ and beyond. Yet there were those (Perkins included) who felt he never truly shook the screen persona of the knife-wielding, mother-obsessed, cross-dressing psychopath, and he was often labelled on the strength of his most notorious role â€“ thus giving a distorted view of a career which spanned four decades and almost sixty movies.\n\nIn More Than a Psycho: The Complete Films Of Anthony Perkins, Dawn and Jonathon Dabell take a closer look at the actorâ€™s entire body of work. Their book provides cast and crew details, an extensive image gallery, background information and considered critical analysis for every title. Perkins was, they argue, more than just a prominent screen villain â€“ his talent and versatility went much further, his wider oeuvre encompassing everything from romance to comedy, from war to westerns, from musicals to sci-fi.\n\nWith a foreword by highly regarded film and pop culture historian Paul Talbot, this is the essential guide to the career of Anthony Perkins.\n\n300+ images.\n\nSpecially commissioned cover by artist Paul Watts.\n\nProofed and edited by Darrell Buxton.\n\nCast and crew information on every film, including films where Perkins was screen-writer or director only.\n\nCapsule biography.\n\nTelevision work.\n\nTheatre work.\n\nTheatrical and TV-movies.\n\nIn-depth, balanced critical analysis of every film.\n\nForeword by Paul Talbot, author of Bronsonâ€™s Loose, Bronsonâ€™s Loose Again!

If you've never heard of the film, most of its cast members or director Pyun, you're not alone. But Pyun has a long-standing and enthusiastic fan base that credits him for being a pioneer in launching the cyborg sci-fi genre in the 1980s. His fans admire him for churning out independent films often under trying circumstances and very limited budgets. Despite having a few surprise hits at the boxoffice, Pyun has often been associated with films that were terminated or unreleased due to financing problems. Still, like the ultimate trooper, he continued to persevere and even today, while battling some significant health problems, Pyun remains determined to be a player in the indie film market. \"Blast\" enjoyed its \"premiere\" on home video, something that has apparently enhanced its reputation among enthusiasts for \"direct to video\" fare (\"DTV\" for those in the know...). While most movie lovers used to avoid DTV product on the assumption that it was deemed to be too bad to merit a theatrical marketing campaign, these fans enjoy making silk purses from sow's ears and claim that many underrated films have suffered the DTV syndrome. They are probably right, but \"Blast\" isn't one of them. The film was made when audiences were still obsessed with the blue collar working man hero generally played by the likes of Stallone, Willis, Van Damme and occasionally Schwarzenegger. The \"grunt and punch\" aspect of these heroes relegated them to limited dialogue, save for the precious \"tag line\" they will inevitably mutter in the course of the film in the hope that it will become the next \"Make my day\"-like catchphrase with the public.\n\n\"Blast\" is set at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics games. The American women's swim team enters the pool area to practice even as the President of the United States and other world leaders arrive in the city for the opening of the games. Just as the women's swim team arrives, the complex is taken over by terrorists led by Omodo (Andrew Divoff) and his band of fanatical followers who have posed as workers for the Olympic organization. The terrified female swimmers under the guidance of their coach Diane Colton (Kimberly Warren) are verbally abused and one of the women is shot to death as a sign to the authorities that the terrorists mean business. Omodo is well-known to international authorities and is wanted by police throughout the world. Seems that Omodo's ego is bruised because his last two terrorist actions have fizzled even though they left behind a string of dead bodies. He is determined to regain his reputation by ensuring the Olympics operation is a success. (Apparently, when terrorists get together at their annual picnic, no one wants to be the butt of colleagues' jokes.) The terrorists quickly kill off any guards and begin operating the complex's security system, thus giving them views of any police attempts to enter the building, which they have made into a fortress by mining the entrances with bombs. Omodo's demands from the authorities must have been fairly mundane because minutes after he issued them, I forgot what they were. In any event, the only person in the complex left to combat the terrorists is Jack Bryant (Linden Ashby), a one-time Olympic star who has seen his life fall apart due to his own demons. He's now working in the building as a janitor. Omodo and his men can occasionally see him on the vast networks of security cameras but Bryant is a savvy guy and learns how to keep on the move and pick off the terrorists one-by-one. (Like most janitors, Bryant is also a world-class martial arts expert). For some melodramatic elements, we learn that Bryant and Diane had once been married but he lost her when his life went into a downward spiral. With the authorities virtually helpless, it's up to Bryant to thwart the terrorists...although he has a an ally in the Atlanta Police Department: Leo ((Rutger Hauer), a wheelchair-bound, eccentric detective who is an old nemesis of Omodo and who manages to provide Bryant with some helpful tips.\n\n\"Blast\" is a storehouse of every action movie cliche from films of this era but it's not as bad as you might think. Director Pyun does the best he can to disguise the movie's limited budget (virtually all of it is shot in one location with a few exterior shots tossed in to break the monotony). Pyun keeps the action moving at a brisk clip and avoids at least a couple of anticipated cliches from coming to pass. However, the sheer monotony of seeing Bryant and the bad guys chase each other up and down very similar-looking hallways and staircases quickly grows wearying. The cast performs gamely, with Linden Ashby suitably hunky and capable of delivering the film's obligatory \"tag line\": \"I'm coming to get you!!!!\" Andrew Divoff brings some Bond villain-like qualities to his role but he's undermined by Pyun insisting that he imitate every vocal mannerism of Arnold Schwarzenegger imaginable. The gimmick proves to be distracting, though Divoff has a few standout moments. The musical score by Anthony Riparetti starts out well but becomes grating because it seems to consist of a constant repetition of the same few notes. The film is occasionally suspenseful and exciting but Pyun goes off the rails during the climax which sees a knock-down fight to the death between Bryant and Omodo that incorporates some ridiculous elements including a bomb explosion that is so poorly rendered that it looks like a frame from a Road Runner cartoon was utilized. Also puzzling are the brief appearances of Rutger Hauer as a potentially intriguing character but the role is drastically under-written.\n\nMVD has released \"Blast\" as a nice-looking Blu-ray edition as part of their \"Marquee Collection\". The box art features a cringe-inducing rip-off of the main poster art for \"Die Hard\" including an exploding skyscraper, even though there are no skyscrapers in \"Blast\", exploding or otherwise. There is a bonus trailer gallery of other similarly-themed titles from MVD, although the trailer for Jean-Claude Van Damme's \"Lionheart\" looks like a poor VHS transfer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nPlagiarism, if done willingly and poorly, generally does not go unnoticed and one cannot help but see certain similarities in various works be it literature, art, or cinema. In listening to the audio commentary with author Jonathan Rigby and director Alvin Rakoff on the new, limited edition Blu-ray of 1980â€™s Death Ship, a horror oddity about an abandoned old ship inhabited by the ghosts of members of the Third Reich(!), a remark is made that the poster for 2002's Ghost Ship was remarkably similar to the poster art for Death Ship, and itâ€™s true that the similarities are uncanny. I can't help but wonder who came up with the idea for the poster for Ghost Ship, as Death Ship was well over twenty-five years-old and seemed to be relegated to the land of forgotten cinema.\n\nCaptain Ashland (George Kennedy) is at the helm of a cruise ship, about to turn over the reins to Captain Trevor Marshall (Richard Crenna) and he's not happy about it. He seems perturbed by this changing of the guard, commenting in no uncertain terms that his place as captain should be regarded as more than something of a novelty to tourists. Unfortunately for him and his guests, the unmanned and haunted titular ship that steers ahead, powered by the blood of its most recent victims, is on a crash course to meet with his. Using footage borrowed from Andrew L. Stone's The Last Voyage (1960) and Ronald Neameâ€™s The Poseidon Adventure (1972), the two vessels collide and Ashlandâ€™s ship begins to fill with water and quickly sinks (too bad The Concorde: Airport â€™79 didn't sink with it!)\n\nKennedy, Crenna, Nick Mancuso (who provided the bulk of the horrifying phone calls in Bob Clark's 1974 film Black Christmas), Sally Ann Howes of Dead of Night (1945) and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and a few other characters manage to be the only survivors in a lifeboat and make their way aboard the decrepit ship that put them in their predicament. Once on board, they find the ship bereft of passengers and crew, and slowly become victims of the supernatural games that ensue.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that the ship in question was once used as a Nazi torture chamber, as evidence of teeth, clothing and medical devices start to turn up in explored rooms. The worst of these rooms houses a group of cobweb-infested corpses, presumably the long-dead Jews whom the Nazis tortured. One might wonder about the boundaries of bad taste pushed in a film that seems to make light of one of humanity's most horrendous and egregious atrocities.\n\nThe director employs some nifty scare tactics, such as a projector that runs itself; a shower that turns blood red; and a crazed George Kennedy, apparently possessed by the long-dead Nazis, going on a rampage. One must wonder why distress signals are not sent, and why help is not forthcoming, given the radio rules in place since the downing of the Titanic in 1912. However, this is a B-movie shot in five weeks and done on a shoestring and asking too many questions is not suggested. The ship in this film is supposed to be steering itself with a life of its own, however one never really gets the feeling that itâ€™s actually alive, that itâ€™s a merchant of evil like the house in Burnt Offerings (1976) or the hotel in The Shining (1980). The film ends the way one assumes with will, but itâ€™s not bad for what it is.\n\nOriginally released on DVD in England in 2007, Death Ship had at the time had been transferred from a print that was not perfect and contained a few sporadic imperfections but was believed to be the best surviving source material. That disc had included a disclaimer citing the film lab that housed the original camera negative closed in the late 1980's and the aforementioned resources were \"lost\" as a result. I would be curious as to how this sort of thing happens as this is certainly not the first time it has occurred, nor will it be the last. I'm always reading of an original negative somehow getting \"lost\". Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell, the TV-movie that Crenna made the year prior to Death Ship, was released on DVD at roughly the same time and that movie looks like it was just made yesterday. Honestly, Devil Dogâ€™s transfer could not be more beautiful. Yet a theatrical film's negative gets \"lost\"? Insert quizzical expression here.\n\nBY JOE ELLIOTT\n\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the release of Franco Zeffirelliâ€™s Romeo and Juliet. The movie was a sensation when it came out in 1968, spurring ticket sales in the millions and becoming one of the top-grossing features of the decade. One reason the film made so much money was due to the number of people who returned for a second or even fifth viewing. It seemed audiences just couldnâ€™t get enough of the story about those two star-crossed adolescent lovers from old Verona. The movieâ€™s memorable music score, composed by Nino Rota, also became a best seller. The album quickly went gold and was later repackaged in a beautiful deluxe box set that included the entire movie soundtrack, along with two handsomely produced companion booklets.\n\nThere was something about the film, for all its shortcomings, that many found almost hypnotic. Iâ€™ll fess up and admit I was one of these people. I didnâ€™t actually see it until the 1970s when it was still being trotted out in theaters in order to squeeze out extra profits for the studio. I was a teenager at the time and was more into flicks like Billy Jack and the Bond films than stories about people who lived hundreds of years ago and spoke in rhyming couplets. The only Shakespeare I had read was in class, the substance of which I found nearly indigestible. I did know something about the movie since one my English teachers had once played a portion of the soundtrack for us in class. However, apparently not having much else to do that summer evening, I decided to take a stroll down the street to our local movie palace and buy a ticket.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the film was how rich in color it was. From the very beginning, following the smoky prologue spoken by Laurence Olivier, everything is drenched in bright primary colors. Things got off to a rousing start with the scene of the bloody brawl in the Verona marketplace between those two wild and crazy families, the Montagues and the Capulets. (I hadnâ€™t realized until then that it was possible to be a real badass and still wear red and yellow striped tights with pointy soft leather shoes.) Soon the cops arrive (the prince and his soldiers) to break up the fracas and issue a stern warning to all those who would disturb the civil peace in the future. Immediately following this we get our first look at Romeo (Leonard Whiting), a handsome love-sick youth with a shaggy haircut. He talks dreamily of some girl heâ€™s got a crush on, but then comes to his senses at seeing one of the wounded being carried away. Meanwhile, back at the Capulet palace, Julietâ€™s father (Paul Hardwick) is coyly negotiating the marriage of his daughter to a young man named Count Paris (Roberto Bisacco). The first time we see Juliet (Olivia Hussey) sheâ€™s running through the house like a kid at play.\n\nAll this is interspersed between scenes of Juliet and her bawdy, fun-loving nurse (Pat Heywood) talking to the girlâ€™s mother Lady Capulet (Natasha Parry) about marriage and things, immediately followed by a night scene of Romeo and his friends on a soliquious pub crawl through the deserted streets of Verona. Later that same evening Romeo and his mates crash the Capulet masquerade ball. The ball scene is among the highlights of the film. It is here Zeffirelli really shows his stuff, combining visual pageantry with an almost obsessive attention to detail. Everything about this sequence is highly choreographed, from the beautifully composed dance scenes (â€œthe moresca!â€) right down to the fastidious arrangement of the candles and platters of fruit (Zeffirelli had studied art and architecture in his student days). Absolutely nothing is left to chance. In the hands of a less gifted visual director, and Zeffirelli was nothing if he wasnâ€™t visual, all of this might have come off as too showy and distracting. However, here the effect is just the opposite. The viewer almost feels as if he or she is present in the scene, seductively pulled in as we are by the sensuous whirl of warm colors, voices and melodious music. All of it lovingly captured by the gifted eye of cinematographer Pasqualino De Santi who was awarded an Oscar for his efforts on the project. Clearly, the ocular accoutrements of this particular production are as essential to its success as the words of Shakespeare himself.\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nTwilight Time has released the 1965 action adventure film \"Genghis Khan\" as a limited edition (3,000) Blu-ray. The film was released almost ten years after Howard Hughes produced the notorious clinker \"The Conqueror\" starring John Wayne as the legendary Mongol leader. A decade later, producer Irving Allen ensured he did not make the mistake of laughably miscasting the leading man. Omar Sharif, then a red-hot up-and-coming star, was cast in the title role, and while an Egyptian actor might not seem to be an obvious choice, Sharif possessed an exotic international appeal that saw him convincingly play characters of many different ethnic backgrounds. Ironically, while Allen had successfully hired a leading man, his judgment did not extend to the key supporting roles. If you want to enjoy \"Genghis Khan\", there are many positive aspects to the film- but you will have to overlook some jaw-dropping casting errors. That feat is a bit like trying to calmly peruse a newspaper in your living room while ignoring the 800-pound gorilla who is sitting across from you, but more about that later.\n\nThe film opens with a brutal raid on the tribal home of the young Mongol Temujin and his family. The raid is led by a rival Mongol tribe headed by the merciless Jamuga (Stephen Boyd), who murders Temujin's father and enslaves the women of the tribe. The story then jumps ahead a number of years and we find Temujin (Omar Sharif) has now grown to manhood and is still a captive of Jamuga. He's forced to wear a giant wooden yoke around his neck as a reminder of his humiliation. Ultimately, Temujin escapes captivity with the help of holy man Geen (Michael Hordern) and a mute Mongol warrior named Sengal (Woody Strode.), much to the chagrin of the infuriated Jamuga. Temujin vows to bring the warring Mongol tribes together so that they can form an unstoppable army capable of conquering the known world. How he achieves this is never shown but before long we see he has indeed amassed a devoted army intent on uniting the remaining Mongol tribes, one of which is headed by Jamuga.One of Temujin's obsessions is to humiliate Jamuga, which he does by kidnapping his woman, Bortei (Francoise Dorleac), who he then makes his own wife. As played by the gorgeous but ill-fated Dorleac (she died in a car crash in 1967), Bortei sports a modern hair style and the latest trends in makeup. She's a Mongol by way of the emerging mod scene on Carnaby Street. Dorleac is miscast but at least her performance isn't embarrassing. The same cannot be said of some of her otherwise revered cast members.\n\nSince the film is designed to entertain, not enlighten, we are presented with a truncated historical record of Temujin's conquests. In short order, he and his army become feared as they relentlessly conquer seemingly any land they want to occupy, either by having the inhabitants willingly accede to their demands or face defeat in battle. The script boils down these tumultuous events into a Cliff Notes adaptation of a Classics Illustrated comic book. Temujin next sets his sights on the legendary land of China, and are admitted entrance through the Great Wall. Here they are guided by Kam Ling, a wise man who serves as chief adviser to the Emperor. The role is played by James Mason and if you thought, as I did, that this great talent was incapable of presenting a bad performance, be prepared to be enlightened. Mason sports a sem- Fu Manchu mustache and seems to be foreshadowing those now cringe-inducing Chinese detectives that would be played by Peter Sellers and Peter Ustinov. But wait! Mason's performance seems positively inspired compared to that of Robert Morley as the Emperor. Yes, that Robert Morley, the rotund and usually delightful British character actor who played every role in precisely the same manner. Thus, we have the Emperor of China depicted as a prissy, comical figure. (Presumably, Paul Lynde was not available for the role.) The miscasting of these two pivotal roles makes it difficult to concentrate on the otherwise compelling script by Clarke Reynolds and Beverly Cross. Fortunately, events move quickly. The Emperor treats Temujin and his army with great reverence and respect- and Temujin is even giving the honorary title of Genghis Khan (\"Great Conqueror\"). But Temujin correctly suspects that they are being held as captives in a gilded cage. Seems the Emperor realizes that Temujin suspects that the Chinese military is a paper tiger and that he would be tempted to gather an even bigger army and take the nation by force. In a creatively-staged scene, the Mongols use the Chinese fascination with fireworks as an elaborate method to affect a daring escape. Armed with the advanced military technology they have secured from China, the Mongols' ever-growing armies continue to sweep through kingdoms far and wide. Jamuga, who had been held captive by Temujin but managed to escape, refuses an offer to join Temujin's forces- and even insults him by implying that Temujin's young son had been fathered by him. This results in a \"Mongol Duel\" in which both men go mano-a-mano, with the surviving winner taking control of the armies. The sight of two sweaty, hunky shirtless men grappling with each does have an unintended and amusing homo-erotic aspect but the scene is quite suspenseful.\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER, Cinema Retro Editor-in- Chief\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has announced changes to its annual Oscars broadcast. The event will be confined to three hours and certain awards will not be seen live on the broadcast. Instead, they will be given out during commercial broadcasts then edited into a segment that will be shown later in the telecast. After all, who wants to see some science-obsessed geek get honored for inventing something that enhanced the film industry when, instead, we can all enjoy some innovative ads for erectile dysfunction? Additionally, in an admitted attempt to gin up ratings, AMPAS will introduce a new awards category for outstanding achievement in popular film. That's right, movie lovers...you might live to see the day when the producers of a \"Transformers\" movie stroll on stage to be honored in the manner in which the greatest filmmakers of all time were. In fact, \"popular\" movies have long been recipients of major nominations. Films such as \"Jaws\" , \"Star Wars\" and \"The Towering Inferno\" were nominated for Best Picture, while a little flick from 1997 named \"Titanic\" won the coveted award. Exactly how the Academy will distinguish which \"popular film\" releases should be relegated to the new category is not known. What if the \"popular film\" that is honored happens to also gain a Best Picture nomination- or will the categories be mutually exclusive? AMPAS isn't saying.\n\nAMPAS has been grappling with sagging ratings for the Oscars for years. Unless there is a major blockbuster to liven up the proceedings, audiences tend to drift away from the broadcast. Not helping matters is that the Golden Age of great Hollywood stars is also long over. That isn't anyone's fault but the lack of legends on any given broadcast only serves to diminish the special quality of the evening, as does the fact that there are now so many movie awards shows that ol' Oscar is struggling to remain relevant. The producers of the show are undermining the very people the ceremony was designed to honor. This is nothing new. AMPAS decided years ago that it was too boring to broadcast honorary awards to older people in the industry, thus these have now been consigned to a couple of snippets from an earlier ceremony. Ditto with the geniuses who are honored with technical awards. Under the current scenario, Charles Chaplin's acceptance of an honorary Oscar in 1972 (one of the great moments in Hollywood history) would now be deemed unworthy of being telecast. Instead, the broadcast has morphed into a quasi-comedy special hosted by late night hosts who replicate inane (and often embarrassing) extended skits that seem to drone on forever. It's the height of irony that there is plenty of time to allocate to such nonsense but it comes at the expense of the true artists who are supposed to be the focus of the show. As we point out every year in our review of the ceremony, even the tastefully creative tribute to talents who passed away in the last year has become contentious. Rather than simply extend the segment for a few additional minutes to include more qualified artists, the truncated tribute now not only excludes legendary personalities but even famed artists who were once nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe reaction in the industry over these proposed changes has been universally negative, leading us to think this is the worst marketing \"improvement\" plan since the introduction of New Coke in the 1080s. Hopefully, the backlash with cause those who make the decisions at AMPAS to rethink their position- otherwise we're likely to soon see the creation of the Steven Seagal Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE\n\nâ€œBEAUTY AND BRAINSâ€\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nOne of the unsung heroines of the 20th Centuryâ€”her fame as a Hollywood star notwithstandingâ€”is actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr. Few have known about her extraordinary proclivity to invent stuff, and even less are aware that she came up with a patent (in collaboration with a musical composer, no less) during World War II for a communications system that was later adopted and is still used today.\n\nBombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, a wonderful documentary on the womanâ€™s life and career, deliberately emphasizes that Lamarrâ€™s scientific knowledge and technical imagination takes precedence over her Hollywood legacy. And while Lamarr appears to have maintained an upbeat attitude throughout the decades, the motion picture reveals that her struggles were many. Lamarr was troubled, misunderstood, and too many times ignored for her efforts beyond being a â€œpretty face.â€\n\nPretty she was indeed. Lamarr was one of those Hollywood beauties who turned heads and dropped jaws. She was talented, tooâ€”a competent leading lady with on-screen charisma and a chemistry with (most) of her co-stars. Unfortunately, the Hollywood moguls, namely Louis B. Mayer at MGM, refused to cast her out of the pigeon-holed slot of â€œglamour girl.â€ Only after she broke away from the studio and took better control of the kinds of roles she played did she begin to display a wider range. Perhaps her most well-received role was that of Delilah in Samson and Delilah (1949), for which she campaigned in person to director Cecil B. DeMille. â€œI am Delilah,â€ she told him. He believed her.\n\nLamarr, who was from Austria, had made a controversial picture there in 1933 entitled Ecstasy, in which she frolicked about in the nude. A love scene focused on her face, which portrayed, well, an orgasm. Looking at these clips today, they all seem tame; but thenâ€”they were extremely potent. This â€œscandalâ€ followed her to Hollywood and seemed to forever taint her career in a hypocritical business that exploited young starlets all the time. Nevertheless, she persevered and made a name for herself, becoming one of Tinsel Townâ€™s biggest stars of the 1940s.\n\nMore significant, Bombshell contends, is that Lamarr should have been more appreciated for her brainpower. In the early days of the war, prior to the U.S. involvement, Lamarr teamed up with avant-garde composer George Antheil to come up with a way for battleships to communicate with torpedoes and guide them to their targets. The system was called â€œfrequency hopping,â€ and was based on the way player piano rolls were constructed. If radio signals to a torpedo jumped around in frequency, the Germans would be unable to block the transmissions. The couple received a patent for the idea. Unfortunately, the Navy poo-pooed the notion and shelved it. It was discovered later, after the patent had expired, that the system was indeed developed and put into use. Lamarr and Antheil never profited from their invention, but apparently the system became the basis for much of todayâ€™s communications technology in GPS and WiFi.\n\nWriter/Director Alexandra Dean assembles a fascinating portrait of Lamarr in a lean 88-minute feature that relies on vintage footage, film clips, and interviews with family members (Lamarr had a tumultuous love lifeâ€”she was married six times), filmmakers and film people (Mel Brooks, Peter Bogdanovich, Robert Osborne, Diane Kruger, Gillian Jacobs), and the scientific community. Dean doesnâ€™t pull punches when it comes to some of Lamarrâ€™s more problematic historyâ€”her studio-inflicted addiction to drugs, an arrest, the abandonment of an adopted child, and her rejection of her Jewish past. Mostly, though, the film is a celebration of a remarkable woman with an astonishing sense of self, curiosity, and innovation.\n\nKino Lorberâ€™s 1920x1080p Blu-ray looks marvelous, and the vintage film clips are especially sharp and clear. The soundtrack is 5.1 Surround with optional English SDH subtitles. Special Features include an interview with director Dean, outtakes of interviews with Brooks, Jacobs, and Osborne, and trailers.\n\nFor anyone interested in Hollywood and/or World War II history, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story provides worthwhile, revelatory viewing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nAlfred Sole is a production designer who has carved out a nice career for himself in Hollywood, most notably on the television shows Veronica Mars (2004-7), Castle (2009-16), and the reboot of MacGyver (2017-18). Long before he chose that line of work however, he dabbled in the world of film directing. His first film, the 1972 hardcore sex â€œcomedyâ€ Deep Sleep, must be seen to be believed because despite a few flourishes of cinematic style and several humorous sequences involving dialogue, itâ€™s just a hardcore sex romp featuring folks no one in their right mind would want to see naked let alone copulating. There is absolutely nothing in this film to suggest that he would next direct one of the greatest and most thematically disturbing thrillers of our time, 1976â€™s Communion, not to be confused with the Christopher Walken/alien-probe-up-the-old-dirt-road 1989 outing based on Whitley Strieberâ€™s 1987 â€œnon-fictionâ€ book of the same name. His subsequent films, 1980â€™s Tanyaâ€™s Island with the late and impossibly gorgeous Denise Matthews (credited as â€œD.D. Wintersâ€) and 1982â€™s star-studded comedy Pandemonium both fared poorly at the box office, hence his career change. Thankfully Communion, with its high cinematic style and deceptively low production budget, refused to die.\n\nIn her screen debut, Brooke Shields plays Karen Spages (rhymes with â€œpagesâ€), the younger sister of Alice Spages, the latter brilliantly portrayed by New Jersey-born actress Paula Sheppard. Karen is favored by everyone around her and can do no wrong, mostly because Alice is a, forgive the pun, holy terror. Alice teases Karen, locks her in a building to scare her, and mistreats her communion veil. Why the horseplay? Alice was conceived out of wedlock and is not entitled to receive the Holy Eucharist. As if this is her fault.\n\nOn the day of her first communion Karen is brutally murdered right in the church and all suspicion points to her sister after she finds the discarded veil and wears it to the altar. This sets in motion some truly well-acted scenes wherein the identity of the killer is constantly in question. Everyone suspects Alice, even her neighbor Mr. Alphonse (Alphonse DeNoble), an obese monstrosity you must see to believe. Karen and Aliceâ€™s mother Catherine (Linda Miller) is grief-stricken and meets her ex-husband Dom (Niles McMaster) at the funeral. Afterwards, there are suspicions about Aliceâ€™s whereabouts during Karenâ€™s murder and Alice submits to a polygraph which she mischievously pushes on to the floor. Her Aunt Annie (Jane Lowry) battles with her sister and the latter accuses her of hating Alice because of her sinful status. Annie refutes this until she herself is attacked in a shockingly bloody sequence and fully believes that Alice is the killer.\n\nAlice takes place circa 1961 as evinced by the production design, the old-style cars, the calendar on the wall, and the prevalence of a poster of Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s Psycho (1960) that can be seen if one really looks for it. Originally reviled amid concerns that itâ€™s an attack against the Catholic Church (how can it not be?), the film was met with lukewarm box office. Director Sole was rumored to have stated that the church was simply the milieu he wanted to set the story against, but the commentary infers otherwise. Itâ€™s one of the most Catholic-themed films Iâ€™ve ever seen, even more so than William Friedkinâ€™s The Exorcist (1973). It has a look, a feel, and an atmosphere all its own. This film is quite simply one of the best low-budget American horror films ever made. It boasts a superbly eerie score by Stephen Lawrence who scored a handful of other films. Yours Truly has been wishing for a soundtrack album of this music for years, however one has yet to surface. Great editing, wonderful set design, and excellent music all come together to make Alice an enjoyable shocker that can easily be viewed more than several times.\n\nThis film has had a strange history. Filmed in Mr. Soleâ€™s hometown of Paterson, NJ in the summer of 1975, Alice premiered in Paterson (Lou Costelloâ€™s old stomping grounds) under its original title Communion on Saturday, November 13, 1976 at the Fabian Theater (now the Fabian Building). The event was met with much fanfare, however a subsequent theatrical release failed to stir much interest. Communion was dropped by the original distributor, picked up by another, retitled Alice, Sweet Alice, re-cut and redistributed in 1981 as Holy Terror and played up Ms. Shieldsâ€™s participation in response to the success of the previous yearâ€™s The Blue Lagoon. It then made its way to cable television and local independent stations where the bulk of us caught up with it. Later on it was relegated to VHS collecting dust in discount bins beginning in 1985 with Goodtimes Home Video, seemingly forever to be lost within the public domain due to a legal snafu. I bought it for ten dollars, which was unheard of in an era when the MSRP on a VHS tape was roughly eighty dollars. In 1998, the film received a laserdisc release from the Roan Group which sported a highly entertaining audio commentary from director Sole and the filmâ€™s editor, Edward Salier. The film was given two DVD releases later on, which ported over the commentary. Even without the benefit of Sole's discussion, one can easily see the influence that Nicolas Roeg's astonishing Donâ€™t Look Now (1973) has on this film.\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nMovie-going audience members under the age of forty will not recall motion picture theatrical exhibition in the 1970s. It was a most interesting time when drive-ins and even first-run movie theaters would pair up an older feature film, generally one that was one to two years-old, with the main feature on a double-bill. A handful of theaters in my area used to engage in midnight showings of older films, too. One theater exclusively ran The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) for years while another alternated between Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Ralph Bakshiâ€™s Wizards (1971), Led Zeppelinâ€™s The Song Remains the Same (1976), David Lynch's art-house favorite Eraserhead (1977) and Alan Parker's Pink Floyd The Wall (1982). Other showcases included uncensored bloopers featuring Carol Burnett, the Three Stooges, and Abbott and Costello.\n\nIn October 1978, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was unleashed upon the moviegoing public (filming had begun in early 1977). The film is an effort to poke fun at the Japanese disaster and monster invasion films of the 1950â€™s and 1960â€™s, movies that, according to director John DeBello, were mostly unfamiliar to the moviegoing public. Billing itself as a comedy, to today's eyes, it's really anything but that. Despite a few laugh out-loud sequences the film, which runs nearly 90 minutes, feels nearly twice that length. There are many films that came out during this era that are disjointed and suffer from ineffective editing like Attack. Black Socks (aka Video Vixens) (1974) was an effort to introduce hardcore sex into a comedy and failed miserably. The Groove Tube (1974) and Mr. Mikeâ€™s Mondo Video (1979) are two other inane attempts at hilarity. However, there are some truly funny films in this vein, as 1977â€™s Kentucky Fried Movie and Airplane! in 1980, can attest to. In Attack, there is a humorous scene wherein military officials all cram into a small room for an impromptu meeting to discuss the best course of action against the tomato attack; a sequence involving a blind traffic cop; a badly dubbed Japanese official; and the requisite Jaws parody â€“ bested by the aforementioned Airplane!\n\nAttack recalls the similar premise of George A. Romeroâ€™s Night of the Living Dead (1968) wherein dead bodies inexplicably are reanimated and begin feeding on human flesh. The one major difference here is that the unsuspecting American public is under attack by giant, killer tomatoes. The plot is almost too convoluted to be believed for a send-up, but the basic premise involves the government attempting to keep the seriousness of the tomato attacks under wraps so as not to give way to mass hysteria and have to call in the military.\n\nWhat makes people laugh today is apparently different from what made people laugh forty years ago. However, there are certain comedies that are timeless. No matter how old I get, Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, and the Three Stooges never fail to make me laugh. There aren't too many films made in the last thirty to forty years I can claim are able to do that. Even Itâ€™s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), with its television viewings and innumerable home video releases, is still to this day laugh out-loud hilarious. The interaction between all the characters is truly astonishing. There is no such chemistry between anybody in Attack. Iâ€™ll admit itâ€™s unfair to compare Stanley Kramerâ€™s epic comedy filled to the brim with comic geniuses who honed their talents for years with a film put together by a group of movie fans who wanted to make a film. To be fair, Attack probably was designed to play at drive-ins where people had other things on their mind besides a movie. And who can blame them? If you had to watch this film, you would do better off filing your nails.\n\nI won't hold it against you if you're a fan of this film as I have my share of guilty pleasures, and if you are a fan then this DVD/Blu-ray is an absolute must-have. The restored, 4K transfer is very colorful and the film has never looked batter. The 2003 DVD release had several extras that have been ported over to this new release, and I will also list the extras that for some reason fell by the wayside. I would love to see half the number of extras lavished upon this film bestowed upon some of my favorite and lesser-known films that I grew up watching. For a film of this kind, the new DVD/Blu-ray combo set from MVD is jam-packed. It would have been nice if they included a hilarious cut of the film itself!\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nMy only memory of \"Swashbuckler\" was seeing it for the first time when it was already in release for a year. The occasion was that this was an in-flight movie on my first trip to Europe in the summer of 1977. In those ancient times, films were still shown on 16mm projectors on pull-down screens in the main cabin. I remember being unimpressed with the film but the distraction of the (then) free liquor service might have affected my opinion. As Cinema Retro's latest issue features coverage of the 1977 film \"The Deep\" starring Robert Shaw, I decided to revisit \"Swashbuckler\" largely because it also stars the estimable Shaw, who never gave a bad performance. I found my opinion of the pirate tale had improved considerably since the first viewing. It's a raucous, old-fashioned yarn that perhaps too earnestly tries to recapture the vim and vigor of those old screen adventures that would star Errol Flynn or young Burt Lancaster. Ably directed by James Goldstone, who takes full advantage of the lush Mexican locations (representing old Jamaica), the film opens in the court of Lord Durant (Peter Boyle), the corrupt British governor of Jamaica who rules the island like a tyrant. When honest nobleman Sir James Durant (Bernard Behrens) runs afoul of him, Durant has him arrested and imprisoned to await execution of a death sentence. He also commands that Durant's wife (Louisa Horton) and daughter Jane (Genevieve Bujold) be evicted from the family estate and forced to live in a tenement. Durant's main nemesis is the pirate Ned Lynch (Robert Shaw), who- along with his merry men- acts as a sort of Robin Hood, stealing from the corrupt rich and dispensing much of their fortunes to the poor. Predictably, Jane has an encounter with Ned and professes to loathe him, but as these things inevitably play out, we know the two are attracted to each other. After much griping and fighting that literally includes a duel between Jane and Ned, she implores him to come to the aid of her father, who is facing imminent execution. Ned and his men launch a full-throttle attack on Durant and- if you haven't guessed it- save the day.\n\n\"Swashbuckler\" is undistinguished on most levels except for the fact that it is exciting and lives up to its title by including an abundance of terrific sword fights. Kudos to all the actors, who performed these extended and exhausting duels with great professionalism, including Bujold, whose slight build must have certainly posed an obstacle in filming these scenes. The supporting cast includes some esteemed names including Geoffrey Holder (in full \"Live and Let Die\" Baron Samedi mode) and Beau Bridges as a bumbling British army officer appropriately named Major Folly. The action is impressively filmed by cinematographer Philip H. Lathrop and it's all set to a lively score by John Addison. Shaw seems to be having the time of his life in what must have been a physically taxing role for him. Although the stuntmen are in abundance, it's quite clear he did many of his own action scenes. (Shaw says in the production featurette on the DVD that the film was more physically challenging than \"Jaws\"). Bujold does well as the gutsy young woman who defies sexual stereotypes and Peter Boyle is a great deal of fun as the evil Durant, even if he is miscast as a British nobleman. James Earl Jones has a prominent role as Ned Lynch's right-hand pirate. \"Swashbuckler\" wasn't designed to win awards or become a boxoffice blockbuster. It represents the kind of modest production that was designed to entertain and make a quick profit in an era before every release represented a major financial risk for the studio.\n\nThe Universal DVD features a very nice transfer and some welcome extras including an interesting original production featurette about the making of the film, cast and crew biographies and production notes and the original trailer.

His achievements included such classics as \"On the Waterfront\", \"The African Queen\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\". His body of work, though not nearly as extensive as that of some other producers, was notable in the sense that Spiegel thought big and shot for the moon when it came to bringing to the screen stories that spoke to the human condition. Following the triumphant release of \"Lawrence\" in 1962, Spiegel did not make another film for four years. When he did, the movie - \"The Chase\"- turned out to be a star-packed drama that won over neither critics or audiences. Spiegel had a more ambitious idea for his next production, a screen adaptation of the best-selling WWII thriller \"The Night of the Generals\" by Hans Helmut Kirst. Spiegel had the inspired idea of reuniting his \"Lawrence of Arabia\" co-stars Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif. They were reluctant to take on the project, but they certainly owed him. Both were virtual unknowns until Spiegel gave them the roles that made them international stars. Spiegel also added to the mix an impressive cast of esteemed British actors ranging from veterans such as Donald Pleasence and Charles Gray to up-and-coming young actors Tom Courtenay and Joanna Pettet. He chose Anatole Litvak to direct. Litvak had been making films for decades and had a few notable hits such as \"Sorry, Wrong Number\", \"Anastasia\" and \"The Snake Pit\". Spiegel being Spiegel ensured that the production benefited from a large budget and an appropriate running time (148 minutes) that would allow the story to unfold in a measured process.\n\n\"The Night of the Generals\" is certainly a unique spin on WWII films. There are no battles or major action sequences, save for a harrowing sequence in which the German army systematically destroys part of the Warsaw Ghetto. Instead, it's very much a character study populated by characters who are, indeed, very interesting. The film opens with a tense sequence set in occupied Warsaw. The superintendent of an over-crowded apartment building accidentally overhears the brutal murder of a local prostitute in a room upstairs. From a hiding place he witnesses the killer walk past him. He does not see the man's face but recognizes his uniform: he is a general in the German army. The man keeps this information to himself on the logical assumption that divulging it might mean his death sentence. However, under questioning from the army investigator, Major Grau (Omar Sharif), he tells the shocking details of what he witnessed. From this moment, Grau becomes obsessed with finding the killer. Grau may be a German officer, but he is a pure cynic when it comes to the Nazi cause and the brutal methods being employed to win the war. He can't control the larger picture of how the war is being waged but he can control what is in his jurisdiction: bringing to justice the man who committed this one especially savage murder. Grau soon centers on three suspects. The first is General von Seiditz-Gabler (Charles Gray, channeling his future Blofeld), an effete, well-connected opportunist who is in a loveless marriage to his dominating wife Eleanore (Coral Browne). Then there is General Kahlenberg (Donald Pleasence), a man of slight build and low-key personality who has some eccentric personal habits that may include murder. Last, and most intriguing, is General Tanz (Peter O'Toole), a much-loathed and much-feared darling of Hitler's inner circle whose ruthless methods with dealing with civilian populations disgust his colleagues. Tanz has been sent to control or obliterate the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nThe screenplay (which includes contributions by an uncredited Gore Vidal) is a bit disjointed and cuts back and forth to the present day in which we see a French police inspector, Morand (Phillippe Noiret), investigating the case twenty years later as he tries to tie together Grau's findings with dramatic developments that occurred during his handling of the case. Morand also appears in the war era sequences, having befriended Grau, who does not seem at all disturbed when he learns that Morand is actually a key figure in the French Resistance. Grau becomes particularly intrigued by General Ganz. He is an elitist snob who is devoid of any humor or compassion. A workaholic with seemingly no human weaknesses, Tanz is ostensibly under the command of his superior officer, Gabler, but it becomes clear that his political connections make him the top general in Warsaw. Major Grau interviews all three suspects and finds that any of them could be the murderer. When he becomes too intrusive, he is conveniently promoted and transferred to Paris, presumably to shut down his investigation. However, as the fortunes of war decline for the Third Reich, the top brass is eventually moved to Paris and Grau resumes his investigation when he discovers that prostitutes are being brutally murdered there as well. There is a parallel story that accompanies that of the murder investigation. It centers on Corporal Hartmann (Tom Courtenay), a young soldier who has been reluctantly acclaimed to be a national hero. It seems he was the last surviving member of his unit after a bloody battle. The brass used him as a propaganda tool, bestowing medals on him for heroic actions. In fact, he is a self-proclaimed coward whose only goal is to stay alive through the war. Hartmann confesses this to his superior, General Kahlenberg, who is amused by his honesty. He assigns him to be General Tanz's personal valet and orders him to show Tanz the history and sights of Paris. Neither he nor Tanz wants to partake in the venture, but Gabler orders Tanz to take a few days vacation, largely because he despises the man's presence. The scenes in which Hartmann tries to appease the mercurial Tanz without making any missteps are fraught with tension and suspense. Tanz is a fascinating character, presumably devoid of the vices most men have. However, in the course of their time together, Hartmann realizes that Tanz is somewhat of a fraud. He surreptitiously drinks to excess and changes into civilian clothes in order to meet with prostitutes in seedy bars. Although Tanz chews out Hartmann for every minor infraction, he seems to come to respect the younger man's professionalism. This sets in motion another complex plot development that also involves Hartmann's secret romance with General Gabler's free-spirited daughter Ulrike (Joanna Pettet).\n\nJust trying to summarize the various plot strands of \"The Night of the Generals\" in this space is fairly exhausting. Oh, did I mention that another subplot involves Field Marshal Rommel (a cameo by Christopher Plummer) and the July, 1944 plot on the part of rebellious German officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler? Nevertheless, although the various story lines become quite complex, they are all tied together eventually in clever and compelling ways. The film is part \"Whodunnit\", part political statement and part war movie. The movie moves back to the present for its intense conclusion as Inspector Morand is finally able to solve the crime and attempt to bring the culprit to justice. When the killer is revealed it's about as shocking of a development as the revelation that the butler did it in one of those old British film noir mysteries. Still, director Litvak (who shares the producer credit with Sam Spiegel because he owned the screen rights to the novel) keeps the action flowing briskly running time and elicits outstanding performances from his cast. O'Toole, who would later capitalize on playing larger-than-life characters, was at this point in his career still very immersed in portraying introspective, quiet men. He is quite mesmerizing as General Tanz and quite terrifying as well. Sharif is, at least on the surface, badly cast. I'm not aware of any Egyptians who became prominent German officers. Sharif has the map of the Middle East on his face and lingering remnants of his native accent. It's to his credit that he overcomes these obstacles and gives a very fine performance as the charismatic investigator who doggedly pursues his suspects with Javert-like conviction. All of the other performances are equally outstanding, with Courtenay especially impressive- and one has to wonder why the very talented Joanna Pettet never became a bigger star. The international flavor of the cast gives the film a Tower of Babel-like effect. Some of the actors attempt to affect a quasi-German accent while others speak with British accents, and then we have the French and Poland-based sequences with even more diversity of languages. Still, if you could accept Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood speaking \"German\" in their native tongues in \"Where Eagles Dare\", you won't find this aspect of \"The Night of the Generals\" to be particularly distracting. I should also mention the impressive contributions of composer Maurice Jarre, cinematographer Henri Decae and main titles designer Robert Brownjohn (remember when films even had opening titles?) In summary, the film-which not successful with critics or the public- is a thoroughly intriguing experience and affords us the joy of watching some of the best actors of the period sharing the screen.\n\n\"The Night of the Generals\" has been released as a limited edition (3,000 units) Blu-ray from Twilight Time. The transfer is gorgeous, giving full impact to the impressive cinematography and lush production design. There is also an isolated score track, the original trailer and an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo, who examines Sam Spiegel's attempts to rebuild his career in subsequent years only to find that he was out of place in the new Hollywood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER\n\nBY MARK MAWSTON\n\n(All photos copyright Mark Mawston. All rights reserved.)\n\nWeâ€™ve all had it happen to us: after years of watching your favourite films in your â€œsecond homeâ€, your favourite cinema closes its doors and the projection light flickers on the end titles for the last time, only to be replaced by the flutter of pigeonâ€™s wings who come to roost in the empty theatre before demolition. It happened to me with the Jesmond Picture House in Newcastle and Iâ€™m sure most readers have had a similar experience. In these days of theatres without flesh and blood projectionists and the slightly automated feeling that brings to movie-watching, it is always special to have one last bastion, thriving on the tradition itâ€™s built up over many years and one you love and visit like an old friend. Such has been the case with the London Film Fairs at Westminster Halls which Iâ€™ve been attending since moving to London exactly 30 years ago this week. Although itâ€™s great to have something fresh, itâ€™s also cathartic to have an experience that seems new, yet traditional at the same time, which is the way I feel about these shows. I canâ€™t tell you how many wonderful collectibles Iâ€™ve picked up over the years here and although it became a well-loved routine to go there every other month, it never ceased to provide surprises. Sometimes that pleasure may come from meeting a memorabilia dealer who had your passion for the same films or having the opportunity to meet and photograph one of your childhood heroes through their talks about appearing in the James Bond series or the Hammer and Amicus horror films. Sometimes there were cast and crew reunions, such as the memorable time the cast of \"Thunderbirds\" got back together with no strings attached. Thus, It was a great shame but sadly not much of a surprise to arrive at Westminster on Saturday 30 June not only to find it was the last day of the month but also the last fair at these hallowed halls.\n\nThe London Film Fair began 45 years ago and was run by the much-missed Ed Mason for many years before Thomas Bowington took over, retaining the essence of what Ed had begun, yet bringing a more professional feel to the event, reflected in the many stars who attended. The shows are now under Showmasters management. Although the September Fair was always one of the biggest of the year, the next fair has been cancelled as the event is now moving to The Royal National Hotel in Bedford Way in London, near Russell Square. It remains to be seen if this change of location brings with it changes in those dealers and collectors who attend. One would hope it wonâ€™t but it was the familiarity I described earlier that worked so well, not only for the collectors but alsofor those who were selling, many of whom attended those first shows. One would hope that the fair, like the films it celebrates, will be seen as worth preserving by those behind the scenes as well as those who attend. Weâ€™ll know on November 18th.\n\nThe main stars of the June show were, as ever, from all genres; from Bond â€œOctopussyâ€ star Vijay Amritraj, to Jane Merrow (who I interview in the latest issue of Cinema Retro, #41), Sylvia Syms, Susan Penhaligon, Rosalind Knight, Leonard Whiting (who posed for Retro in his best Romeo stance from the 1968 classic), to Dr. Who companion Louise Jameson and Bond Girls Helen Hunt (â€œOctopussyâ€) and â€œYou Only Live Twiceâ€â€™s Yasuko Nagazumi. The star of the show, however, was Tom Baker, who had huge queues waiting to see him and got rapturous applause when he finally entered the building after being delayed. All in all it was a great day, although one tinged with a little sadness as it was the end of an era. Of course, although Tom Baker was the main draw, the other stars of the day were the dealers whose incredible posters, soundtracks, stills and other memorabilia still make this show one of a kind. I hope the London Film Fair's loyal attendees follow it to the new venue, as they are its beating heart.\n\n(For more about the film fairs, go to: www.londonfilmconvention.co.uk)\n\nBY BARBARA IRVIN\n\nThe date was Wednesday, March 27, 1974. The film premiering that night at Radio City Music Hall was Mame. This first public screening of the lavishly produced and choreographed story, which took Broadway by storm in the 1960s, was a laborious experience for everyone involved. With its much anticipated release, cast and crew alike showed up to offer their support and to delight in the audienceâ€™s appreciation. Even the star, Lucille Ball, attended this highly publicized event. For the first time, fans got a different glimpse of their favorite television personality. That evening, she arrived not as the ravishing redhead people were used to seeing, but as a black-haired beauty in a white dress, which was quite short and just happened to be featured in the film. Moviegoers were getting a preview of what was to come.\n\nAnd what an entertaining extravaganza it was! The alluring ambiance in every scene, as well as the divine dancing and sensational singing, kept viewers enthralled for the entire two hours and twelve minutes of the picture. Everybody except the critics, of course.\n\nFor the most part, the reviewers did not have nice things to say about Mame or its featured players. Some noticed the sentimentality that came through during certain moments, such as the scene in which the main character and Patrick, her young nephew, sing â€œMy Best Girlâ€. However, the majority of them failed to properly acknowledge a movie that took two years to complete and cost around $12,000,000 to produce. This was especially true with Lucille Ballâ€™s performance. Considering the faith Warner Brothers had in their chosen leading lady, the negative notices were a major letdown to the studio and to the actress herself.\n\nPlaying Mame meant so much to Lucille. She saw the role as her last chance to prove to the world that she possessed what it took to be a glamorous movie star. Never one to pass up an opportunity, Lucille made it her ultimate goal to win the producers over. Indeed, they saw something special in her that no other actress could radiate.\n\nOnce she nabbed the covered part, Lucille put a lot of effort into creating her own interpretation of the character. Unfortunately, all of this hard work came to a halt when she broke her leg while skiing in Colorado. Lucille felt bad about holding up production. When producers learned about her fear of being replaced, they quickly assured her they would wait for her return.\n\nWith projects featuring such big names as Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, Warner Brothers cranked out movies that were popular among the younger crowds. When the company purchased the rights to the musical version of Mame, they envisioned it as a picture everyone could enjoy. Therefore, finding a seasoned entertainer who had plenty of clout became necessary. At the time, Lucille was one of the most influential women in Hollywood, due to her achievements behind the scenes as much as on camera. This factor made it practically impossible for her fellow contenders to be chosen over her.\n\nAll of the power in the world could not prevent the barrage of crass comments made by the critics. They took aim at everything from her gravelly voice to her extreme thinness. Despite the harsh remarks, Lucille refused to let her anguish interfere with the promotional tour she embarked on soon after filming wrapped. She willingly posed for photographs, endured the mundane task of answering repetitive questions asked by inquisitive reporters, and appeared on talk shows like The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Phil Donahue. Suddenly, the most recognizable female in the field of physical comedy was popping up everywhere.\n\nThe cheerful facade occasionally slipped, allowing her candor to reveal itself. Blaming photographers, Lucille once admitted to a journalist that she felt old. Tired of seeing unflattering images of herself every time she picked up a newspaper or magazin"
