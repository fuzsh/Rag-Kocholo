        "text": "Paranormal horror movies will mostly conjure up scary images of ugly and sinister ghosts, evil entities, and demons making life living hell by haunting humans. Then you have characters like Ed and Lorraine Warren from The Conjuring series, John Constantine from the movie Constantine, and Elise Rainier from the Insidious franchise using their psychic abilities to perform exorcisms and make the world ghost-demon-free. But, how often do you come across movies that show people capturing ghosts and stuffing them in bottles or holding them by their necks and punching them in the face? Rare, right? While there’s enough said about exorcists, here is a shout-out to ghost hunters or ghostbusters that are practically getting into fist-fights with ghosts. Time to stream movies and web series about ghost and demon hunters on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and more.\n\nEmbark on a thrilling ghost-hunting journey with these engrossing movies and shows; on Netflix and more\n\n1. Ghostbusters series — Zee5, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies, Apple TV\n\nThis successful series, which started in 1984, spawned a couple of sequels, TV series, and video games. The primary plot focuses on three parapsychology professors and friends — Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, and Ray Stantz — who become ghostbusters after they encounter one in their college library. Armed with hi-tech equipment powered by nuclear energy, they form an agency that helps people troubled by ghosts, paranormal activities, demons, and troublesome demigods. The first movie follows the trio helping a cellist, Dana Barrett, who is worried about paranormal activities in her apartment. The sequel is set five years after the first movie. The trio is put out of business due to lawsuits following the destruction they caused in capturing the notorious deity in the first movie. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a direct sequel to the second film with events taking place 32 years later and following Egon’s family. The first two movie stars Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis in lead roles.\n\n2. Ghostbusters: Answer the Call (2016) — Amazon Prime Video, SonyLiv, Zee5\n\nThis movie is a reboot of the first Ghostbusters (1984) film. The movie stars Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Chris Hemsworth in pivotal roles. Abby Yates (Melissa) and Erin Gilbert (Kristen) are estranged friends who had co-authored a book titled Ghosts from Our Past, which chronicles their experiences as ghostbusters since high school. Years later they meet again after Abby republished their book, much to Erin’s chagrin, who has given up that life. Abby promises to cease publication only if she helps her and engineering physicist Jillian Holtzmann, in investigating a haunted mansion. They are later joined by Patty Tolan (Leslie), a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee after she complains about a ghost in the subway terminal. They start a ghost-hunting business but call themselves Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination. They hire the handsome jock Kevin (Chris) as a receptionist to gain more business. But trouble comes knocking at their door when they discover the increasing ghost sightings have been caused by an occultist and scientist Rowan North (Neil Casey). Though there’s no direct reference to the original films except for the appearances of the OG cast but in different roles.\n\n3. The Frighteners — Google Play Movies\n\nFrank Banister (Michael J Fox) is an architect living a happy life with his wife Debra. But, Debra’s death in an accident forces the grieving Frank to quit his profession. He’s also troubled by his newly-gained psychic powers to see ghosts. Frank starts conning people by telling them that their homes are haunted with the help of his ghost friends. But, while helping a client Frank comes across a Grim Reaper, who’s responsible for the increasing deaths. When Frank is under the radar for a murder caused by the Grim Reaper, he decides to use his powers for a good cause. Frank receives help from his supernatural buddies and detective Lucy, who is the Grim Reaper’s next target.\n\n4. Lockwood & Co — Netflix\n\nThis supernatural detective thriller is based on the first two books from author Jonathan Stroud’s eponymous series. The web series, consisting of eight episodes, is set in an alternate modern-day Britain. Ghosts, which adults can’t see but children can, are haunting the country for almost 50 years. To tackle the problem, the country has approved licenses for teenagers to open ghost-hunting agencies and get rid of evil spirits. Runaway teenager Lucy Carlyle ends up in London to find a job. She comes across a detective and ghost-hunting agency, Lockwood and Co run by Anthony Lockwood and George Karim. Soon, the trio ally and use their respective talents to hunt ghosts and conduct paranormal investigations.\n\n5. Don’t Kill It — Amazon Prime Video\n\nThis horror comedy follows Jebediah Woodley, a demon hunter, travelling to a small town in Mississippi to destroy an ancient demon with homicidal tendencies. The small town is terrorised by a spate of homicides caused by a demon who possesses his victims and forces them to murder their families. Evelyn Pierce, an FBI agent who grew up in the same small town is assigned to the case. When Jebediah warns Evelyn and local police chief Dunham about the demon they dismiss his claims and detain him for being mentally ill. But, when he convinces them to investigate deeper and ask witnesses about the killers’ eye colour, they begin to believe him and offer help. The narrative then takes an interesting turn when the demon makes Evelyn his next target."
