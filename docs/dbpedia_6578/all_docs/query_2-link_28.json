        "text": "I’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man (or an equivalent character), the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nAfter a decade or so of Universal’s successful run of monster films, the world was changing. The Depression had ravaged many American families and, although the US was yet to enter proceedings, the Second World War was now raging in Europe. Perhaps that’s why the studio injected some comedy into its series. Everyone needed a laugh in 1940.\n\nThe Invisible Woman’s storytelling has a similar mood and pace to His Girl Friday – Howard Hawks’s sublime romcom from earlier that same year – while another Cary Grant film, 1937’s ghost comedy Topper, was also an influence. The dialogue is littered with sarcasm and self-deprecation, while scenes feature double-takes, prat-falls and plinky-plonky incidental music. It all results in a bright and likeable experience, directed by a man with real comedy pedigree: London-born A Edward Sutherland had been one of the original Keystone Cops; had worked with Chaplin and Laurel & Hardy; and had recently directed Abbott & Costello’s first ever movie. We are a far wolf’s cry from the spooky Gothicana of Dracula and Frankenstein.\n\nRather than a conventional sequel, The Invisible Woman is narratively unrelated to Universal’s earlier Invisible Man movies. We’re introduced to an eccentric scientist, Professor Gibbs (John Barrymore in one of the final roles of his lauded career), who is working for an American dilettante called Richard Russell (John Howard). When it’s pointed out that Gibbs is spending a lot of money, Russell is blasé: ‘He must be inventing something. I never asked.’ In fact, Gibbs is developing an invisibility process. He tried it on a cat, but the effect wore off, so he now places a classified ad in the Daily Record newspaper. Initially the wording reads ‘Wanted – a human being, willing to become invisible, $3000 remuneration’, but Gibbs has a rethink and changes ‘$3000’ to ‘no’.\n\nAnd then – how’s about this for a plot twist? – a *woman* replies!\n\nThe woman in question, Kitty Carroll, is a department-store model who’s bored with life. She seems game for taking a risk, so Gibbs reluctantly agrees to let her try his process, which plays as a whimsical parody of Dr Frankenstein’s experiments: there’s scientific equipment abuzz, levers to pull, and bolts of electricity flashing between coils. Originally, Margaret Sullavan – who was under contract to Universal – was cast in the role of Kitty, but she was eager to do another project instead… so simply didn’t show up for the filming. Virginia Bruce stepped in at the 11th hour, bringing a good deal of comic energy to the film, while Sullavan, who’d recently co-starred with James Stewart in The Shop Around the Corner, was hit with a legal backlash.\n\nAfter the invisibility procedure, Kitty is of course able to move around unseen. So the first thing she does is return to the department store to prank her obnoxious boss and some prim, posh customers. She has lots of fun, as does the creative team responsible for the film’s special effects – we see clothes and gloves moving around as if by magic, doors slamming of their own accord, and Kitty’s boss trapped under a window sash. Elsewhere, a romcom thread is sewn when Kitty encounters Richard, but sadly the unquestioned sexism of the era means that, from this point on, Kitty’s entire personality becomes related to her appearance, her figure and her clothes. Will Richard still fancy her when he can *see* her?! (Just generally, the movie seems childishly giddy with the risqué conceit that the invisible Kitty is actually naked through all this.) There’s also a crime subplot involving a gangster played by Three Stooges member Shemp Howard, but this never feels essential.\n\nInstead it’s the breezy comedy, the playful special effects, Virginia Bruce’s charm, and the comedic secondary characters – a housekeeper played by The Wizard of Oz’s Margaret Hamilton, a butler played by Charlie Ruggles – that create a diverting 70 minutes of fun.\n\nSeven combinations of chemical, biological and dynamic influences out of 10\n\nNext time: It’s a wolf, man! It’s the Wolf Man!\n\nRecently, to celebrate a decade of this blogging nonsense, I posted a list of my 100 favourite films.\n\nSo, as an obvious sequel, here’s the same format but for television. Again, I’ve been guided by the word ‘favourite’, rather than ‘best’. They’re just the shows I like the most. (I’ve also cheated a few times, in order to bundle sequels together with their antecedents, so there are actually more than 100 choices here. Live with it.)\n\n100-51\n\nThe list is too unwieldy for a full ranking, so let’s start with the shows that fill the bottom half of the hundred, listed alphabetically, then we’ll dive into a top 50…\n\n24 (2001-2010), Agent Carter (2015-2016), Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1995), The Big Bang Theory (2007-2019), Births, Marriages and Deaths (1999), A Bit of a Do (1989), Blackadder (1983-1999), Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013-2021; above), Callan (1967-1981), Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967-1968)…\n\nCoogan’s Run (1995), Coronation Street (1960-current), Dark Season (1991), Dracula (2020), Family at War (1970-1972), Foyle’s War (2002-2015), Game of Thrones (2011-2019; above), G.B.H.

Or included something you think is awful?\n\nLet me know in the comments section below…\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nUniversal Studios, hip to the success of their horror films, were starting to churn them out by 1940 – every big hit was being sequalised while the audience was still hungry for more. The Mummy’s Hand is the first follow-up to Boris Karloff’s The Mummy of 1932, though actually the two films don’t share any plot crossover. This is more of a spiritual sequel, reusing the same mixture of low-level horror, Tutankhamun iconography and xenophobic representations of Egypt. Oh, and it’s the first truly dreadful entry in this series.\n\nThe focus is on two American archeologists who buy a vase in a Cairo market for $75. The buffoonish Babe Jenson thinks it’s a piece of junk, but his more strait-laced colleague Steve Banning (Dick Foran) accurately deduces that markings on the exterior will lead to the long-lost tomb of Princess Ananka. Ignoring condescending telegrams from their museum back in New York, the men organise an ad-hoc expedition to the location. For funding they conveniently get chatting to a stage magician in a bar and the Great Solvani (Cecil Kellaway from The Invisible Man Returns) agrees to help. Meanwhile, a high priest called Andoheb (George Zucco) is growing obsessed with Solvani’s daughter, Marta (Peggy Moran) – and he has a secret weapon: the mummified body of an Ancient Egyptian called Kharis (Tom Tyler) who is being kept alive via magical means…\n\nAfter a reasonably spooky prologue, setting out the sub-Tolkien mumbo-jumbo of Kharis’s backstory, there’s no real horror until the 43-minute mark when the mummy awakens. In a film that’s only just over an hour long, that’s quite a chunk without any real thrills. In its place comes some low-energy comedy in the form of mild bickering between Abbott and Costello clones Babe and Steve. There’s also now the unintentional humour of a lead character called Babe, resulting in several straight lines that take on a different meaning to modern ears: ‘What’s all the excitement, Babe?’, ‘Babe, those jackals give me goose pimples.’ By the way, Babe is played by Wallace Ford who, despite the Brooklyn accent and attitude, was born in Bolton in the north-west of England.\n\nThe movie lacks any kind of vim, with a simplistic plot and boring characters struggling to fill a short runtime. A sense of going through the motions is also confounded by the budget-saving choice to recycle sets, music and even some footage from earlier Universal films. We don’t even get any star power from the mummy character when he does finally join the action. Boris Karloff’s dignity and sincerity have been replaced by a more shambling, ‘monster’-ish take by Tom Tyler.\n\nFour trick revolvers out of 10\n\nNext: The Invisible… Woman?!\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nWell, the title is a lie for a start: this sequel does not feature the same Invisible Man as the 1933 original. Our new see-through character does have a familial link to Claude Rains’s Jack Griffin. But despite previous Universal horrors being named after relatives of villains – Bride of Frankenstein, Dracula’s Daughter, Son of Frankenstein – it was felt that audiences might blanche at The Invisible Man’s Brother.\n\nThe brother in question is Frank Griffin, played by British actor John Sutton. Nine years after Jack developed the secret of invisibility, Frank now uses the process to help a friend escape from police custody. Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) has been wrongly convicted of murder, so now that he’s free he’s able to investigate incognito and hunt for the real killer…\n\nThe Invisible Man Returns starts with an appallingly creaky scene – overacting servants discussing whether their imprisoned master will get a reprieve – but thankfully this low-rent mood doesn’t last. In fact, as mid-budget horror films go, this one has a rather remarkable cast. In 1940, Vincent Price was on the early rungs of a career ladder that would lead him to immortality. He’d just appeared with Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff in Richard III drama Tower of London and continued to crop up in films of many types. But it was in the horror genre where he built his lasting legacy, lighting up House of Wax (1953), The Fly (1958), House of Usher (1960), Witchfinder General (1968), The Abominable Dr Phibes (1971), Michael Jackson’s Thriller (1983) and many more. In The Invisible Man Returns, his hypnotic accent and soulful demeanour are perfect for a role that is largely a voice part – you can detect the makings of a star. (Price’s knowledge of German also came in handy on set, as it meant he could converse properly with Austrian director Joe May who barely spoke English.)\n\nThe aforementioned John Sutton had also been in Tower of London. So too had Nan Grey, memorable for a small role in 1936’s Dracula’s Daughter and here playing the love interest. Elsewhere we get Alan Napier – Alfred the butler in the 1960s TV series Batman – as a shady guy working for a mining company, and Cedric Hardwicke – a respected English stage actor who was later directed by Hitchcock, Olivier and DeMille – as Radcliffe’s cousin. It’s a good cast, who elevate a tatty script and keep us interested in the intrigue.\n\nThe pick of the bunch, though, is Cecil Kellaway as Scotland Yard detective Sampson. Sampson is a smart man with a knowing look in his eye who clocks immediately how Radcliffe has escaped from his prison cell. The Invisible Man Returns is really more of a murder mystery with a sci-fi twist than a traditional horror, and it would perhaps have been a more compelling film if Sampson were the central character and we followed the investigation through his eyes.\n\nBecause despite the best efforts of the cast, this story is told rather blandly. The directorial tone sticks relentlessly to the middle of the road – it’s mildly funny but never a hoot, sometimes edges towards a thriller without ever really gripping you. The special effects, meanwhile, are less audacious than in the first film, though there is some fun. A scientist has cages for invisible animals and in each one we see a collar and lead moving around seemingly of their own accord. In fact, the film’s best moment combines this kind of whimsy with its strongest character: Sampson is able to identify where the invisible Radcliffe is by blowing cigar smoke in his direction.\n\nSix extractions of an East Indian herb that took the colour out of things out of 10\n\nNext: Get ready to shake The Mummy’s Hand!\n\nAn occasional series where I watch and review works inspired by Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula…\n\nThese reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nFaithful to the novel? Based on the Marvel character of the same name, who had only debuted in the comic books a couple of years earlier, animated TV series Spider-Woman follows magazine editor Jessica Drew, who tackles a variety of villains and monsters using an arachnid alter ego.\n\nIn lieu of an introductory episode, we’re told the backstory during each week’s opening titles. When Jessica was a child, she was bitten by a venomous spider, so her scientist father injected her with an experimental antidote (‘spider serum #34’), which saved her life but also gave her superhuman abilities… While ‘weaving her web of justice’, Jessica (now an adult voiced by Joan Van Ark, later of Dallas and Knots Landing) can fly, thanks to web-wings on her red-and-yellow spider-suit, as well as stick to walls and ceilings and shoot ‘venom blasts’ out of her hands. When not in her superhero persona, she’s a hotshot editor who runs Justice Magazine; her closest friends are photographer Jeff Hunt (Bruce Miller) and her young nephew Billy (Bryan Scott).\n\nThe show’s connection to Dracula comes in the 10th episode, Dracula’s Revenge, which was originally broadcast on 24 November 1979. In a spooky graveyard, two grave robbers resurrect the vampire Count Dracula who has been entombed for 500 years. He is very much the Dracula cliche: Romanian accent, fangs, goatie board, red-lined cape, the ability to turn into a bat. Before he was defeated five centuries earlier, the Count put a curse on the family of his rival Van Helsing, and now he’s back he seeks out the rival’s descendent – who bizarrely lives in Castle Dracula – so he can turn him and his friends into vampires.\n\nThankfully, Jessica somehow intuits the danger – even though she’s several thousand miles away – and heads over to Europe with Jeff and Billy in tow. Dracula, meanwhile, also resurrects two allies: the Wolf Man and a very Boris Karloff-like Frankenstein’s Monster. Jeff and Billy are soon turned into monsters, and then Spider-Woman begins to metamorphose into a half-vampire, half-wolf hybrid. But thankfully she’s able to do some quick library research into the creatures and, one-by-one, squash the threats.\n\nSetting: The modern day (late 1970s). Jessica and her pals live in an unnamed US city, presumably New York, and we see them attending a local cinema to catch a horror film. But the bulk of the action takes place in Romania. Jessica travels there at first via her superhero ability to fly, but when she has to return later accompanied by Jeff and Brian they use the Justice jet-copter.\n\nBest bit: Given that Spider-Woman was a children’s show, the way Count Dracula converts victims into the Undead had to be changed, of course. So rather than seduce people and drain their blood, this version of the character shoots green laser beams out of his hands and this somehow results in them becoming vampires. No sex please, we’re a kids cartoon.\n\nReview: Created for television by genre legend Stan Lee, the animated series Spider-Woman only ran for 16 episodes. In that time the lead characters encounter a myriad of flamboyant threats – a resurrected Egyptian Mummy, a demon, time-travelling Vikings, urban criminals, dinosaurs, a giant spider, androids, aliens – but neither Jeff nor Billy ever learn that Jessica is a superhero. In the standard format of these things, they just don’t spot that Jess goes missing as soon as Spider-Woman swings into view. (Dracula’s Revenge actually contains a sly joke about this: Jessica is forced to switch into her Spider costume in a phone box – a deliberate nod to fellow hero Superman. ‘Well, it’s not exactly my style,’ she says to herself, ‘but it’ll have to do.’)\n\nIt all makes for a diverting adventure series that features some whimsical threats and doesn’t outstay its welcome. The use of Dracula is part of a long tradition of the vampire count cropping up in cartoons for children – see also Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, Scooby-Doo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and more – and while the drama of the situation never approaches anything too complex, the writers have fun hinting towards the cliches. But the series’ most appealing aspect is the fact Spider-Woman is a quietly progressive cartoon series. For one thing, it was the first animated superhero show to focus on a female character; for another, Jessica is a successful professional who doesn’t bat her eyelashes at any of the male characters. Maybe that’s what riles the famously misogynistic Dracula the most.\n\nSix monster pictures (they give me nightmares) out of 10\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nThis film starts with a boastful credit: ‘Universal presents BASIL RATHBONE, BORIS KARLOFF, BELA LUGOSI in…’ That’s quite a cast. Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein’s monster and Count Dracula, all brought together. The Invisible Man‘s Claude Rains and Hungarian star Peter Lorre were also in the running for Rathbone’s part. But the studio bosses were right to promote the talent at their disposal. Their horror-movie sequence was now well established – and about to become something of an assembly line. Son of Frankenstein is the first of an astonishing *15* Universal Monsters films released within just six years.\n\nWhereas the earlier Frankenstein movies had taken place in a nebulous, fin de siècle, mid-European hinterland, events have now moved on. We’re in the modern day, albeit one that never references the outside world, and Colin Clive’s Henry Frankenstein is long dead. As the story begins, Henry’s grown-up son Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Rathbone) returns to the town named after his family. With the help of a local blacksmith called Ygor (Lugosi), who has a crooked neck from a failed hanging, Wolf realises he can rebuild the Frankensteins’ reputation by resurrecting his father’s famed Creature (Karloff) and proving the experiment was justified…\n\nThere’s some placeholder dialogue and this is the longest film in the series so far, so it’s not as punchy as we’ve been used to. But there’s fun in the details. For example, local police chief Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) has a surreal tic: a fake arm, which he manipulates with the other to salute or hold his monocle. We learn that his real arm was torn off by the Creature when Krogh was a child, adding a backstory and a personal connection; the character and his disability were spoofed in 1974 comedy film Young Frankenstein. Director Roland V Lee also dips into the same expressionist toolbox that enthused James Whale earlier in the series, keeping things visually interesting with Brugelesque peasants, enormous and theatrical sets, artful shadows and rainy exteriors. (Lee considered shooting in colour but a test of the Creature make-up was not successful.) The film may lack Whale’s subversive wit but is nevertheless atmospheric and enjoyable.\n\nSeven faiths, beliefs and unfoldments out of 10\n\nNext: The Invisible Man… returns!\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nThe plot of this delayed sequel to the Bela Lugosi-starring Dracula is sometimes said to be based on Bram Stoker’s short story Dracula’s Guest. However, the resulting film shows precious little connection to this prose source, which may or may not have originally been a chapter of Stoker’s most famous novel. (Draculaologists have spent a century debating this point. It seems probable that Stoker cut out the section early in his seven-year writing process. His widow then published the ‘deleted scene’ as a self-contained short story after Bram’s death.) Whatever the provenance, Dracula’s Daughter stands as an enjoyable film in its own right.\n\nSurprisingly, given how impressive the finished movie is, there was chaos during pre-production. Versions of the script were junked, numerous writers took stabs at new drafts, cast members were replaced, and directors were switched. James Whale – fresh off the success of Bride of Frankenstein – originally agreed to direct what would have been his fourth Universal horror, but then got distracted by more high-end projects. In the event, with the studio’s option on the Dracula rights running out, the gig was given to a journeyman called Lambert Hillyer. In the following decade, he would direct the first on-screen version of Batman (a 15-part cinema serial), but arguably Dracula’s Daughter has had a more lasting influence on popular culture.\n\nUsing a line of thinking that was later repeated by Hammer Films in the late 1950s, Universal figured that Count Dracula himself couldn’t appear in this sequel because he’d died in the first movie. (The notion of supernatural resurrection would come later.) But the vampire’s corpse does appear briefly as Van Helsing (a returning Edward Van Sloan) recaps the events of the 1931 film for the police. Rather oddly, other major characters such as Mina and John are neither seen nor mentioned. The focus then moves to a new lead…\n\nFirst appearing with only her sad, expressive eyes visible above a scarf, the vampire Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden) is the previously unmentioned daughter of Count Dracula. She steals her father’s body and burns it, hoping that this ritual will release her from her own demonic curse. The plan fails, meaning she must continue feeding on innocent victims, but Zaleska still wants to change. So, aided by her lugubrious lackey Sandor (Irving Pichel), she seeks assistance from a psychiatrist. This offbeat twist for a mass-market horror flick actually has a historical resonance: Sigmund Freud was developing the concept of psychoanalysis at the same time that Bram Stoker was publishing Dracula, and many commentators have read Freudian implications in the novel. After all, Freud claimed that there are two dominating impulses behind human behaviour, which other psychoanalysts later dubbed Eros (the drive for life, love, sex, self-satisfaction) and Thanatos (aggression, destruction, violence, death). The entire vampire trope is built upon this combination of sex and death.\n\nBut the psychiatrist featured in Dracula’s Daughter is no stuffy, self-important Austrian who talks about cigars, anal fixations and the Oedipal complex. A personification of 1930s swagger and debonair detachment, Dr Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger) is seen first on a golfing holiday. We also meet his assistant, an American woman called Janet Blake (Marguerite Churchill), and together this flirty pair feel like they’ve been drafted in from a screwball comedy. The contrast shouldn’t work – a Gothic horror playing against a romcom – but it does. Brilliantly. Both sides of the story benefit from the charms of the other.\n\nShot more conventionally than Tod Browning’s original movie, Dracula’s Daughter is nevertheless a finer, more confident piece of filmmaking. An effectively creepy tone hangs over the Countess’s scenes, while secondary characters are well-cast, notably Nan Grey as a young woman targeted by Zaleska. Decorated by some effective incidental music and a few moments of humour, the story rolls along very enjoyably, and Zaleska – cinema’s first sympathetic vampire – is a fascinating character, bringing a huge amount of melancholia to the Universal series. (The actress thought the movie was tripe. You’d never know that from her soulful performance.) There’s also undoubtedly a sapphic subtext at play here, which was made explicit in a little-seen but fascinating quasi-remake called Nadja (1994).\n\nEight long shadows on the hillsides out of 10\n\nNext: After the daughter of Dracula, meet the son of Frankenstein!\n\nPrevious review: I appraised this film as part of my Dracula blogging project in 2017.\n\nFor a review of Nadja, click here.\n\nTo celebrate a decade of this blogging nonsense – my first review was published on 2 April 2014 – here is a list of my 100 favourite films.\n\nThe lengthy process to whittle down several hundred contenders was obviously a flawed exercise – totally subjective, unashamedly biased, occasionally based on transitory whims, and somewhat narrow (most movies are American, almost every director is male).

Or included something you think is awful?\n\nLet me know in the comments section below…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nA powerful warrior called Teth-Adam is unleashed after 5,000 years of mystical imprisonment and begins to wield his unique form of justice – so a team of superheroes is sent to stop him…\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that, over time, entropy will grow in any self-contained system. In other words, the longer something continues without new impetus, the more it will break down, collapse, fall apart. Metal rusts, organic matter decays, stars burn out. One of the most mind-blowing implications of this is that because the universe itself is a closed system, it too will one day simply stop working. All the activity, energy and dynamic work will even out – a total equilibrium across all of space, which will mean that *nothing* will be able to happen any more. Cosmologists estimate that this will take a while. Perhaps 1.7×10106 years (that’s 1.7 followed by 106 zeroes).\n\nSuperhero movies, however, have taken far less time to reach a stage of flat, listless inertia. After the peak of production and confidence in the days before Covid, the genre has tailed off alarmingly in the 2020s with multiple flops, false starts, fuck-ups and even the shelving of a near-complete movie for tax reasons. And leading the charge into oblivion is Black Adam, which is the 12th entry in the insipid DC Extended Universe series and a quantifiably awful endeavour.\n\nA prologue set in the distant past (‘Before the pyramids,’ a voiceover vagues) tells us the backstory. A young boy in the Middle Eastern country of Kahndaq rebelled against the slavers and, because he accidentally found a chunk of a precious raw material called Eternium, was able to start an uprising. Soon after this, a powerful being dubbed Teth-Adam emerged from the revolution – a folk hero for Kahndaqis for generations to come… We then cut to the modern day. Kahndaq is now run by an organised-crime outfit called Intergang; in an obvious comment on imperialism, they all seem to be thugs with dodgy English accents. Fighting the fight for the oppressed are teenage skateboarder Amon (Bodhi Sabongui) and his archeologist mother, Adrianna (Sarah Shahi). She’s one of those female characters you get in action films who’s strong and tough and independent, so therefore – for some reason – must also be charmless, humourless and lumbered with clunky dialogue such as, ‘I gave up my job at the university and moved four times.’ Her only personality trait is ‘being angry about things’, and Shahi adds absolutely nothing to what’s on the page.\n\nAfter the kind of haphazard archeology that would make Channel 4’s Time Team wince, Adrianna manages to find and reanimate the ancient hero Teth-Adam (now played by Dwayne Johnson) who’s been interred in a set from Tomb Raider for several centuries. He’s an all-powerful, atavistic meta-human, an unstoppable weapon of mass destruction who’s introduced via a burst of the Rolling Stones classic Paint It Black. In a case of have-your-basbousa-and-eat-it, the script tries to position Teth-Adam as a noble figure, defending his country against the Western oppressors… but it can’t help also childishly revelling in him killing and causing indiscriminate carnage. (The character smashes through walls rather than use the nearby door, which does little to convince us of his intelligence.)\n\nThe American authorities are soon worried about the threat of this new murder-machine, so decide to send in a team of superheroes to contain him. But we don’t get the Justice League, we get the Justice *Society*, a second-division team of comic-book also-rans. And rather than establish or embellish these characters properly, the storytelling resorts with leaden laziness to a scene of their leader explaining who they are to his boss, franchise regular Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, appearing on a videoscreen and trying to hide the fact she shot all her stuff in about half an hour).\n\nLong-time fans of the rival Marvel superhero films will find no surprises as Carter Hall (Aldis Hodge) reels off his exposition. He tells Waller that his team includes Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), who’s DC’s clone of Ant-Man (except he can only grow big, rather than small)… Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), who is DC’s version of X-Men favourite Storm (both can control the wind)… and Doctor Fate (a bemused-looking Pierce Brosnan), who can predict the future, kinda like Marvel’s Doctor Strange. Hall himself, who lives in a mansion eerily like Professor X’s in the X-Men movies, uses the superhero persona Hawkman, who is risibly reminiscent of Marvel hero Falcon. There should be some fun here: some sense of a team bonding or already in full swing, some sense that these characters have lives outside of their superhero costumes. Instead, all we get are a few lightly scattered references that mean nothing to viewers who haven’t read the comics – Henry Winkler cameos as Atom Smasher’s uncle, for example, which will generate a knowing ‘Ahh!’ from connoisseurs but an Alan Partridge shrug from everyone else.\n\nWe’re just never given any reason to care about anything – not about Adrianna or Amon, not about Teth-Adam, not about the Justice Society, not about Kahndaq at large. This is a script, for example, where Cyclone’s entire personality and backstory is summed up with one infamously ghastly line of dialogue: ‘The nanobots were injected into my bloodstream by this really messed-up scientist who kidnapped me when I was 15.’ Actor Quintessa Swindell somehow manages to lever this drivel off the page without melting into a pool of embarrassment.\n\nIt’s all utterly feckless, it really is. The character development would embarrass a nursery rhyme. The plot is MacGuffin-based nonsense – there’s talk of the Crown of Sabbac, which has been infused with the power of ‘the six demons of the ancient world’ – and the script bandies about words such as ‘prophecy’ rather than reach for any complex storytelling. There are flurries of senseless action, explosions, fireballs and Zack Snyder-style slo-mo. Comedy is dropped into proceedings with the finesse of a waiter plonking a hammer into your bowl of soup. The quality of CGI suggests that the designers spend too much time playing videogames rather than understanding how real objects move in space. And a smug reference to The Good, the Bad & the Ugly misunderstands the entire point of that classic film.\n\nBlack Adam is essentially a spin-off from 2019’s Shazam! (Teth-Adam appeared very briefly in that earlier film, while Djimon Hounsou reprises his wizard character here in a cameo). But whereas Shazam! featured some silliness, some pathos and a sense of telling a story, Black Adam is the inverse of entertainment: a movie that seems like it’s being provocative in its sheer determination to be mediocre. It was a passion project for star Dwayne Johnson, who was a producer and had been attached through many, many years of development. However, whereas he’s often a likeable movie presence (Fast Five, Jungle Cruise), here he’s drearily, dogmatically boring. The Rock has as much charm as granite. The movie deserves to be buried under a mountain.\n\nOne neo-imperialist enforcer from halfway around the world sent here to steal my country’s natural resources, strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our waters, oppress our heritage and make us wait in line all day out of 10\n\nI’ve set myself the challenge of watching all 28 films from Universal Studios’ golden age of horror that feature Count Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon…\n\nSpoiler warning: these reviews reveal minor plot points\n\nDirector James Whale initially resisted calls to make a follow-up to his 1931 hit Frankenstein, fearful of going over old ground and keen to move on to more prestigious projects. But when his arm was sufficiently twisted, he ended up producing a masterpiece – a stylish, smart and thrilling concoction of high horror and high camp, which stands as one of the genre’s greatest ever films.\n\nImmediately after the mill fire that climaxed the 1931 movie, we learn that the assembled-from-corpse-parts Creature (Boris Karloff, dialling up the sympathetic quota even more this time) has survived. So too has his creator, Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive, in one of his final roles before alcoholism got the better of him). Soon, a strange and unnerving new character called Dr Pretorius arrives. He’s a former tutor of Henry’s and is played by the wonderfully effete Ernest Thesiger, an old friend of Whale’s. (The studio had wanted future star Claude Rains.) Pretorius is a far more amoral character – ‘To a new world of gods and monsters,’ he toasts gleefully in a shot destined for pop-culture immortality. He also carries around his own life-form experiments in small glass jars: miniature people, marvellously filmed via trick photography.\n\nIn order to further push the ethical boundaries, Pretorius blackmails Henry into building a female creature as a companion for the original. The result is played by British actress Elsa Lanchester. Topped by a Nefertiti-inspired hairdo that became often spoofed, the Bride is one of horror cinema’s most recognisable icons. It’s slightly surprising, then, that she actually only appears in the film’s final four minutes. (Lanchester had popped up earlier, though. She also plays author Mary Shelley in a meta prologue intended to set up the Gothic vibe of the story.)\n\nElsewhere, there’s true surrealism and theatricality in the way exteriors are achieved on interior sets, such as the dramatic backdrops of brooding clouds creating oppression in the graveyard scenes. In fact, the art direction constantly pushes things into heightened territory, while John J Mescall’s high-contrast, shadow-heavy lighting is extraordinarily artful, taking the tropes of German Expressionism and pointing the way towards film noir. This is not the real world – it’s ambiguous when and where the events are taking place, for example – but a fairy-tale land of burgomasters and peasants and barons and castles, all blended with humour, pathos and the-Creature-as-Christ parallels.\n\nSeveral decades later, the production of this movie was dramatised in a superb 1998 film called Gods and Monsters, in which we hear Whale (played by Ian McKellen) refers to Bride of Frankenstein as ‘a comedy about death… the trick is not to spoil it for anyone who’s not in on the joke.’ This sly line of dialogue illuminates Bride brilliantly. Neither a relentless horror nor a tongue-in-cheek comedy, the movie expertly combines both. The effect is both bewitching and dazzling.\n\nTen audiences need something stronger than a pretty little love story (so, why shouldn’t I write of monsters?) out of 10\n\nNext: Dracula is dead, long live his daughter…"
