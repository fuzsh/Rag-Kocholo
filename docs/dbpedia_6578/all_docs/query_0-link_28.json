        "text": "Began his career as a prop boy for D.W. Griffith in 1909 and worked his way up to the director's chair six years later. Handling features from 1922, Beaudine was a prolific craftsman rather than an auteur; he worked dependably across a wide range of genres and did on occasion turn out noteworthy films such as the Mary Pickford vehicle, \"Sparrows\" (1926)."
