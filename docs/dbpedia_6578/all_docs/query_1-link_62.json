        "text": "I was somewhat perplexed by this curious, one off, TV drama from 2015. Firstly, this is not a biography of the well known and controversial British psychic researcher. Secondly, despite being based upon a novel by Neil Spring, Harry Price: Ghost Hunter doesn’t follow the source text. Instead we are offered an original story in which Harry Price is requested to investigate a series of alleged supernatural events, surrounding a politician’s wife. If judged purely upon its own merits this is quite an enjoyable ninety minutes drama. The production benefits from strong performances, subtle period detail and a story that doesn’t overreach itself. I suspect that Harry Price: Ghost Hunter was intended to be a pilot for a TV series that was never commissioned, which is a shame. There’s a lot of potential in the material and the period setting is ideal for exploring the supernatural, as there was a surge of public interest in spiritualism in the wake of World War I.\n\nParanormal investigator Harry Price (Rafe Spall) is not averse to faking supernatural activity to solve a case. However he ceases his work after a tragedy occurs on his own doorstep. However, he is visited by senior politician Sir Charles Harwood (Michael Byrne) who wishes him to discreetly investigate a case involving an MP, Edward Goodwin (Tom Ward). Goodwin’s wife, Grace (Zoe Boyle) was recently found walking the streets naked and in a trance. She has also experienced disturbances in her new home. Fearing a scandal Harwood wants the matter resolved. Price is at first reluctant to take the case but when he realises the alternative is for Grace to be committed, he relents. Initially, Edward Goodwin is ambivalent about the investigation and refers Price to the house maid Sarah Grey (Cara Theobald) for any assistance. Sarah doubts Price’s intentions and their working relationship is at first fractious. However, as the investigation proceeds the pair experience further disturbances and discover that the modern residence used to be a Victorian workhouse with a sinister history.\n\nThe relationship between Harry Price and Sarah Grey is core to this drama and it works very well. Sarah has a dim view of mediums as her Mother spends money she can ill afford, consorting with them and seeking comfort over the death of her husband. Hence she is initially unhappy with having to accommodate Price. However, matters become more cordial when she discovers that Harry’s wife was committed and that he will not allow a similar fate to befall Grace Goodwin. The screenplay by Jack Lothian touches upon the psychological damage done to an entire nation as a result of World War I and how many sought reassurance in spiritualism. His depiction of emerging gender politics is robust as Sarah chafes at the restrictions placed upon women in the post Edwardian era. She is an intelligent woman who is forced into domestic service out of necessity and a lack of a husband.\n\nThere are several plot elements in Harry Price: Ghost Hunter that are somewhat under used. Perhaps these were to be addressed further if a full series had been commissioned. Price is aided by Albert Ogoro (Richie Campbell) in his investigations. When we first meet him he is playing upon his African heritage and performing a fertility ritual for a childless couple. Again we touch upon the theme that purveyors of the supernatural are providing a service for the British public at a time of need. Ogoro is an interesting character but we are left wanting more. Plus those hoping for a more overtly supernatural conclusion may be disappointed. After several red herrings, the story’s conclusion is as one would expect, grounded in human failings, although there is some leeway in attributing Grace Goodwin’s visions to a more ghostly source. Overall, Harry Price: Ghost Hunter provides an entertaining and setup for a show that has sadly not yet emerged. Considering what does get given a greenlight these days this is a sad omission."
