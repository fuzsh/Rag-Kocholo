        "text": "William Washington Beaudine\n\n(January 15, 1892 – March 18, 1970)\n\nDirector William Beaudine was born 132 years ago today. Here he is (in the visor) directing John Carradine and Claudia Drake in Monogram’s Face Of Marble (1946).\n\nBeaudine’s story is fascinating (and somewhat tragic), with fate taking him from Hollywood’s A-list to Poverty Row in a flash. Of course, around here we love us some Poverty Row, so the big studios’ loss is our gain. From Bela Lugosi’s “Monogram Nine” to Charlie Chan to The Bowery Boys, Beaudine’s junk movies are usually a lot of fun. And before his professional downturn, he directed the great W.C. Fields in the hysterical The Old-Fashioned Way (1934)."
