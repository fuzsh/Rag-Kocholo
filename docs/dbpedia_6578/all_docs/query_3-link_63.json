        "text": "This was a short and low effort movie, so I’m going to be doing the same for the review. Hopefully you’ll also be as amused as I was watching the film, and the title will also have grabbed your attention. Ironically, it took me longer to write and upload this blog post than it did for William Beaudine to make the film.\n\nJohn Carradine stars as Count Dracula, and whilst he said this was the worst film he had been in his performance is perfectly pitched. He gurns his way through every western cliché riddled scene, chewing the scenery with a frenzied blend of commitment and contempt, and manages to make a giant red cravat look stylish. He eats his way through various parts of the supporting cast, mostly because we’re supposed to hate them for being mildly annoying, and then hyper fixates on Elizabeth, because why not.\n\nChuck Courtney co-stars as the Billy The Kid, and his presence makes even less sense than the Count’s given that so many people are willing to get into fights with someone who is essentially a notorious serial killer. Admittedly he is trying to live a nicer life for Elizabeth, as they’re going to marry, have kids and do other aspirational things, but he’s also got a gun and the jerks he deal with seriously need to be offed. He’s the hero of this movie, and he does a great job as a warm, considerate, and overall caring notorious serial killer.\n\nMelinda Casey plays Elizabeth and, considering that her role is that of a twenty-five-year-old child who’s main job is to be fought over by a man old enough to be her dad and another man old enough to be her grandpa, she does a pretty good job as a wholesome lamp. You’ll never guess who wins.\n\nFor all it’s problems (I’m not even going to go into it’s representation of Native Americans) its still a really fun, all be it light, watch. There is a pace and a sense of adventure to it that means it never gets dull, and the actors are so good that, despite the best efforts of the script, you end up caring about them all. Even Dracula becomes an endearing character, both due to him having fun chowing down on people and the sense of world-weariness Carradine puts into him.\n\nIt is an absurd bit of nonsense, but that doesn’t stop it being a fun watch. You will enjoy it despite all its overt short-comings, and your better judgement, without needing to say it’s “so bad, it’s good”. This slice of embryonic Weird West is cheap, disposable kids cinema and there is a time and a place for that. So, if you find yourself in the right mood and can source a decent copy, give yourself the treat of a bygone Treasure.\n\nThe Raggedyman\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
