Quite simple; they are all conspicuously missing from David Thomson’s Biographical Dictionary of Film. To be more exact, in his shoes, I would add these at the first opportunity.\n\nIt was first published in 1975. I was only 2 years old. It would be about 15 years before I would have been remotely interested in his work – the film buff bug bit me late – but quite appropriately in a way. Thomson is not for people wanting comprehensiveness, or anything obsessive like that. It has always had the feel of a work in progress, of a legacy magnum opus he’s almost afraid of finishing, leaving gaps for himself purposefully. He includes hundreds of figures, but leaves out at least a few hundred more at least equally worthy of inclusion.\n\nWhat marks Thomson out is not who he selects but why and how. You get the feeling he makes his choices not so much out of necessity and worth as how much he will enjoy writing about them. And it’s not just writing; put simply, Thomson is the most erudite and addictive writer on film in history. Kael, Kauffmann, Rosenbaum, Agee, Sarris, Houston, Powell; you name it, Thomson eclipses them all. He’s confrontational, opinionated, forthright and yet also welcoming, or “unputdownable”, as Gilbert Adair put it. You may want to throw the book at the wall from time to time, but you’ll always go back to pick it up, whether to applaud the dismissal of The Informer or How Green Was My Valley (how could I not?) or despair at the slighting of Kieslowski. He may sacrifice a few sacred cows and have things of merit to say about some worthy of none, but he’s true to his own feelings. And yet, sometimes, one has the feeling one is being regaled like a favourite uncle telling his grandchildren of his past. In the Dictionary, for example, see him tear into The Grapes of Wrath, then see him praise it in the companion book Have You Seen…? Watch him call The Secret Life of Words a masterpiece in his entry on Sarah Polley – a definite light for him in what one senses is becoming an increasingly gloomy outlook on modern film – but not completely successful in his entry for director Isabel Coixet. It’s as if he’s arguing with himself, his feelings on a given film or person changing drastically according to mood or day. Only a handful of cinematographers make it – he’s finds the caveat “but well photographed” to a bad film an oxymoron – but seems willing to admit brilliance from a performer in a bad film. Again, it’s purely personal.\n\nTo take some out of the lists above, among performers one couldn’t really deny the likes of Emily Blunt (a knowing choice), Ben Whishaw, Anne Hathaway or the like inclusion, but were baffled at entries on such disposable figures as Barry Pepper (the Bill Paxton of this edition) especially at the expense of Michelle Williams (my pick for potential best American actress of her generation), Ryan Gosling, Amy Adams, the late Heath Ledger, Elijah Wood, Rebecca Hall, Romola Garai, Gael Garcia Bernal, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Kelly MacDonald, Ellen Page, James McAvoy, Asian icons Maggie Cheung, late namesake Leslie, Tony Leung and Ziyi Zhang, or French stars Cécile de France, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Ludivine Sagnier, Déborah François, Eva Green, Emilie Dequenne or Mathieu Amalric. Then there’s those who surely the book has come a year or so too early; Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, Jeremy Renner, Michael Fassbender, Gemma Arterton (yes, that Gemma Arterton – but who watched her in The Disappearance of Alice Creed or Tamara Drewe), Jesse Eisenberg, Abbie Cornish, Aaron Johnson, perhaps even little Chloe Moretz. One thinks of him including Andy Serkis, talking about his work in two superb TV dramas, but leaving out his contemporaries who came to our attention in modern TV drama; no place for David Morrissey, Eddie Marsan, Daniel Craig, Matthew MacFadyen, Robert Carlyle, Sally Hawkins, Christopher Eccleston, John Simm, Philip Glenister, Peter Capaldi, Keeley Hawes, Jodhi May, David Tennant, Timothy Spall, Alun Armstrong and so many more. To illustrate the point, only in the last year Thomson rightly compared the Red Riding trilogy to The Godfather in quality, but no-one associated with it is in the book, from its three directors to mainstays of British small screen acting – the aforementioned Morrissey, Marsan, Hall and Garfield, Warren Clarke, Paddy Considine, Peter Mullan, Mark Addy, Maxine Peake, Sean Bean, Daniel Mays, Jim Carter and the uncanny, ever-frightening Sean Harris. And while Anna Paquin is commended for her work in True Blood – again rightly – calling it one of the TV performances of her generation, would it really place ahead of Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant in Deadwood, Olyphant again in Justified, Ciaran Hinds’ Caesar in Rome, James Gandolfini in The Sopranos or the entire cast of The Wire, notably Dominic West. And then another from Deadwood, Garret Dillahunt, spellbinding as two very different characters in David Milch’s revisionist masterwork, and since indelible in No Country for Old Men, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, The Road and Winter’s Bone. You have been told here.\n\nContinuing with TV there’s a place for Dennis Potter – rightly – but none for Alan Bleasdale, Stephen Poliakoff, Jimmy McGovern (even if his dismissal of so much is a bit embarrassing) or David Simon (for The Wire alone). You’ll find John Cleese and talk of Fawlty Towers, but no Michael Palin, or others immortalised most in TV comedies (think of Harry H.Corbett, Wilfrid Brambell, Rowan Atkinson, Ronnie Barker, Ricky Gervais, Nigel Hawthorne, Phil Silvers or Jackie Gleason). And amongst directors, he finds room for such minor talents as Douglas McGrath, Michael Bay, Garry Marshall, Rob Marshall, Joel Schumacher, Nancy Savoca, Martin Brest, M.Night Shitamalan (sic), Kevin Smith, Neil LaBute, Lee Tamahori and Andrew Wagner. Though there are probably around half a dozen half decent films in their collective output, I could quite happily exist in a world without them, while he leaves out such promising talents as Andrea Arnold, Shane Meadows, Paul Greengrass (even if you don’t like the Bournes or United 93, Bloody Sunday is a better film than either of the included few above have mustered), Hirokazu Kore-Eda, Oliver Hirschbiegel, Shion Sono, Lav Diaz, Tsai Ming-Liang, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Zhang-Ke Jia or Jiang Wen. It seems a sort of American-centric myopia, but also gives one a sense of how Thomson sometimes loves to write obituaries as much as eulogies; sometimes he likes to give a talent time, others he knows right away he has problems with them. The best defence is his own, taken from his piece on Raul Ruiz:-\n\n“I was criticised a few years ago, very reasonably, by Jonathan Rosenbaum for important maverick and foreign figures left out of this book. But I refuse to include them all, and I am always happiest to find a new way of sizing up a person – let alone one as torrential as Raul Ruiz. For the last edition I felt daunted by having seen so few of his scores of films. I have only seen a few more now, but I feel more comfortable facing him – because we are the same age, maybe, and because, I think, we are as torn between film and literature. And I have always known that for me, this book was in part a way of staying loyal to writing in face of the nearly total seduction the movies had made of me. ..”\n\nSo this isn’t the stop to make for comprehensiveness. There’s no mention of the greats of Chinese film prior to Zhang Yimou – so no Sun Yu or Ruan Lingyu to mention only the two most criminal exclusions – or of several Japanese masters – Shindo, Teshigahara, Masumura (and imperious muse Ayako Wakao), Shimizu, Uchida, Yamanaka, Wakamatsu and, the biggest omission of the entire book, Yoshida (and his muse, Mariko Okada). The greatest Japanese film-maker of the postwar era left aside, with Vlacil, Haneke, Tarr, Reitz and Watkins. Among composers there’s no room for so many masters, and among DPs, many better than the nonetheless welcome Willis and Zsigmond have been left behind (no Shamroy, Storaro, Coutard, Decaë; Rotunno, Miyagawa, Martelli, Nykvist, Musuraca, Wong Howe, Garmes, August, to name a mere dozen). One would hope that at least a proportion of them would make it in a future edition, but this won’t be for another 7-8 years – Thomson would be approximately 76 then.\n\nWith regards to British TV, situated now in San Francisco, as he has been for 30 years, he’d obviously be restricted by what makes it to DVD or he gets through friends. Many of the above names he may not be aware of the extent of their work. Even so, he’s more open to it than many, mixing as he does Anglo and American sensibilities. I further have the feeling that many rare, fringe masterpieces that I and others have been obsessed enough to seek out, he hasn’t had the same inkling. One always feels that the movies are his hobby and his love, but in terms of priorities he perhaps has loftier ones; an inherent belief that no movie can come close to Joyce or Proust. And he’s pushing seventy now, mellowed perhaps with age and the obvious love of a close knit family. Only the other week, Sam met him at the Film Forum, and he was as generous and disarming as his text. Seated – as below – he was like a combination of an all-seeing sage from a Japanese anime with just a touch of either Statler and Waldorf (perhaps both). Already I am looking forward to the next edition, despite the fact that I will be around 45 when it’s released. It has its faults, but it’s his book, his selection, and one loves it as much for its maddening opinions and omissions as for those we whole-heartedly endorse. It’s writing of the calibre of which we can never equal but only dream to aspire to, all humble Harold Steptoes embarrassingly trying to punch above our weight. To have read about film and not read Thomson is to be a football fan and never watch Brazil. He’s unassailable.\n\nAppendix – as a tribute, here I present two entries on people I believe the book cries out for entries for; two of the great British eccentrics. I have even laid them out in the format of Thomson’s book, though his style is somewhat harder to capture I have given it a go. I would like to do a series in the New Year, but somehow it feels almost like plagiarism when it’s actually quite the reverse; I’ll let the readership decide if that’s a kosher idea. I feel like one of those fellows in Minority Report arrested for a future crime. It’s a tribute to him and the two Titans wondering how they were left outside to accommodate Johnny Carson!\n\nWill Hay (1884-1949), b. Stockton on Tees\n\nWas there ever a less likely comic icon than Will Hay? Here was a man who could have chosen any one of a number of careers. Educated as an engineer, he was a member of the Royal Astronomical Society and a respected astronomer who wrote a book on the subject and made a major discovery about Saturn. He was a brilliant linguist and translator, speaking six other languages – Latin, French, German, Afrikaans, Italian and Norwegian. He was also an accomplished pilot who gave lessons to Amy Johnson. And, finally, he was Sergeant Dudfoot, Captain Viking, William Porter and William Lamb, the British screen’s premier incarnation of the incompetence in authority. His film career didn’t last as long as you might think, less than a decade in all. He wasn’t the most popular star in Britain in the 1930s – George Formby, Jessie Matthews and Gracie Fields all had bigger grosses – but he was undoubtedly the greatest character comedian of the British pre-war screen.\n\nA star on the radio from the early thirties, the early films are rarely seen now and can be brushed over: Those Were the Days (34, Thomas Bentley); Radio Parade of 1935 (34, Arthur Woods); as a vicar in the terrible Dandy Dick (35, William Beaudine); Boys Will Be Boys (35, William Beaudine), the first incarnation of his seedy schoolmaster, an adaptation of J.B.Morton’s Narkover stories. The turning point came in 1936 with ironically one of his worst films, Windbag the Sailor (36, Beaudine), which paired him for the first time with his soon to be regular cohorts, Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott. Moffatt was the insolent fat boy, the would-be Billy Bunter but with a knowingness beyond his years, while Marriott played old Harbottle, the ancient retainer who looked like he had a decade on Methuselah (in reality Marriott was four years younger than Hay). Marriott was missing from the next two, Where There’s a Will (36, Beaudine) and Good Morning Boys (37, Marcel Varnel), which teamed him with his best director, gave him the chance to perform his “what is a unit of electricity?” sketch with his son Will Hay Jnr, and saw him twisted round the little finger of Lilli Palmer. Sex was never on his radar; we laugh because we know that, in that situation, we’d definitely notice.\n\nThen came his masterpiece, Oh Mr Porter! (37, Varnel), joining Marriott and Moffatt at the remote Ulster railway outpost of Buggleskelly, a classic comedy that stole from The Ghost Train and had the cinema’s greatest ever windmill scene (Brides of Dracula, Frankenstein and Foreign Correspondent included). What makes him so winning is that, though we’ve all known fools like him, he makes us root for him despite being essentially a cowardly crook who encourages his charges’ stealing goods in transit and selling railway tickets for food.\n\nHey Hey USA! (38, Varnel) was an attempt to crack the American market, with Edgar Kennedy, but was a failure. Marriott and Moffatt were back on board for the disappointing Old Bones of the River (38, Varnel), Convict 99 (38, Varnel) – where his thunder was stole by the former as Jerry the Mole, forever digging tunnels under the warden’s office – and Ask a Policeman (38, Varnel), essentially a reworking of Oh Mr Porter!, but nearly as good and enough to turn you off blackcurrant jelly babies for life. The final film for the trio, Where’s That Fire? (39, Varnel), was full of choice moments, but the formula was going stale. Like Tony Hancock did with Galton and Simpson and Sid James, he went it alone. He gave his old schoolmaster character a final and best work out in The Ghost of St Michael’s (41, Varnel), and Marriott and Moffatt were not missed, replaced with silly ass Claude Hulbert, Charles Hawtrey and a rogues gallery of supports. But by now illness was catching up with him. He co-directed his last three films with Basil Dearden; The Black Sheep of Whitehall (41) with John Mills an odd co-star; The Goose Steps Out (42), with him sent undercover to Nazi Germany, teaching Hitlerjunge to give Hitler two rampant digits and perhaps his best performance as someone struggling with German. After a cameo in a straight role as a freight ship captain in The Big Blockade (42, Charles Frend) and a MOI short, and with his health growing increasingly uncertain, he made his final film My Learned Friend (43), a black comedy pastiche of Hitchcock and Harold Lloyd (the climax is on Big Ben) where he was back to his best, opposite Hulbert and doing well not to be upstaged by Mervyn Johns’ giggling serial killer. He was still as popular as ever, but aside from some radio work in the last years of the war and a couple of private performances – one for royalty – that would be it. His health finally failed him after a series of strokes and he died 11 days before the London premiere of Passport to Pimlico (49, Henry Cornelius), the film that essentially ushered in the heyday of the Ealing comedy strain that kept his spirit alive. He could have been one of the Burgundians in Pimlico, but he could also have been Thénardier….or William Dorrit.\n\nAlastair Sim (1900-1976), b. Edinburgh\n\nThere’s a moment in Scrooge (51, Brian Desmond-Hurst) when the eponymous moneylender of Dickens’ Christmas story is being shown around the money exchanges by the hooded, faceless Spirit of Christmas Future. Despite a conversation about a funeral by two businessmen (Peter Bull, who also narrated, was one of them), Scrooge hasn’t cottoned on to the fact that it was his death they were discussing. He turns to the Spirit and exclaims – “My usual place is over there, under the clock. I ought to be there this time of day. But I’m not…I’m not.”\n\nYes, Ebenezer should be there; and equally so should Alastair Sim be in this book. Though it isn’t the only thing he should have been in; The Ladykillers (55, Alexander Mackendrick) for one, in the Alec Guinness role. One of the great comic talents of the British cinema, Sim had the sort of features that seemed drawn to comedy, angular, grave, prematurely bald, hangdog eyes like a particularly miffed owl that has spent the entire day failing to capture sparrows and now wants to just fly back to its nest. He was like everyone’s favourite dissolute uncle, a Polonius just as likely to suddenly burst into that inimitable laugh and turn into Feste.\n\nAn academic from Edinburgh University, that he specialised in English seems in retrospect almost a given, when one considers how he rolled words around in his mouth like a child sucking a fruit pastille, relishing every ounce of flavour in each syllable. He turned to acting in his late twenties and by the mid 1930s was glimpsed in various formulaic movies opposite established stars – George Formby, Jessie Matthews – before the role that first brought him attention, as a somewhat bored Genie in the Crazy Gang comedy Alf’s Button Afloat (38, Marcel Varnel). A series of popular mysteries cast him as sidekick Sergeant Bingham to Gordon Harker’s Inspector Hornleigh (39, Eugene Forde), and two sequels followed, Inspector Hornleigh on Holiday (39, Walter Forde) and Inspector Hornleigh Goes to It (41, Walter Forde).\n\nBy then it was clear he would never be anyone’s sidekick again; Cottage to Let (41, Anthony Asquith), alongside young George Cole, who he and his wife would adopt; excellent in Let the People Sing (42, John Baxter); Waterloo Road (44, Sidney Gilliat), the first of a long partnership with the director and partner Frank Launder; brilliant in his first seminal part, finally graduating from Sergeant to the umbrella-twirling Inspector always listening out for Doodlebugs in Green for Danger (46, Gilliat); the reclusive children’s book author in Hue and Cry (46, Charles Crichton), his only comedy for Ealing; subdued in Captain Boycott (47, Launder); as a con man in London Belongs to Me (48, Gilliat).\n\nBy now he was attracting interest, but refused offers to go across the pond, preferring to stay and play one instead, teamed perfectly opposite Margaret Rutherford as the imperishable Headmaster Wetherby Pond in The Happiest Days of Your Life (50, Launder). He was in Stage Fright (50, Alfred Hitchcock); hilarious throwing a brick through a shop window to claim an inheritance in the otherwise tedious Laughter in Paradise (51, Mario Zampi); Scrooge (51, Desmond-Hurst), his signature role (George Cole would play the younger Ebenezer); Folly to be Wise (53, Launder); Innocents in Paris (53, Gordon Parry); iconic in the otherwise slim The Belles of St Trinian’s (54, Launder) as the headmistress (!!!) and her bookie brother; magnificent as the shadowy inspector in An Inspector Calls (54, Guy Hamilton); Escapade (55, Philip Leacock); at home but somehow wasted in Geordie (55, Launder); badly miscast in The Green Man (56, Robert Day); a cameo in Blue Murder at St Trinian’s (57, Launder).\n\nBy now one felt he wouldn’t have been able to manage the light-as-a-feather shenanigans of the reformed Scrooge; in The Doctor’s Dilemma (58, Anthony Asquith); Left, Right and Centre (58, Gilliat); good in School for Scoundrels (60, Hamer), where his world-weary increasing tiredness suited well, but as if he knew that he and director Robert Hamer were coasting; ill-at-ease supporting Peter Sellers in The Millionairess (60, Asquith); delighted to be doing James Bridie but not at his best in The Anatomist (61, Dennis Vance).\n\nHe would be gone from British screens for a decade, retreating back to the stage and into an isolated private life, more and more distant from those he worked with. He would be Scrooge again, at least his voice, in an animated version for TV in 1972. He returned to the screen as the bishop in The Ruling Class (72, Peter Medak), but was looking very frail; Royal Flash (75, Richard Lester); Escape from the Dark (76, Charles Jarrott). Awarded a CBE in 1953, he refused a knighthood in his twilight years due to his Socialist beliefs and to maintain his privacy. He was increasingly rarely seen, retreating to his Hampstead home to get out of the spotlight in the same way a vampire avoids sunlight. And think of it, Sim could have been Nosferatu…with Buñuel directing."
