Upon arrival they discover weird events taking place, such as lights turning on when a match is lit, and a disappearing organ. Soon they discover that these events are not the actions of ghosts, but of a mad scientist who is conducting illegal experiments in the basement.\n\nUpon encountering the scientist, Sach quickly becomes part of the experiment when the scientist wants to take part of his brain out and put it into a gorilla. A fight ensues and, after the cops arrive and apprehend the criminals, the boys find themselves at the police station telling the story of what happened.
