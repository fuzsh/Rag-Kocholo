        "text": "Robot Ninja Media presents a paranormal investigation spanning over a decade in the upcoming documentary The House in Between, produced and co-directed by “Ghost Hunters” and “Ghost Nation” star Steve Gonsalves. The paranormal investigator co-directed the film with Kendall Whelpton, and it’s set for Digital and DVD/Blu-ray release on May 5th, 2020.\n\nThe documentary tells the story of Alice Jackson, who has refused to spend another night in her own home after a life-changing paranormal experience. Looking for answers, she opened her house up to investigators and allowed them to conduct the first-ever, decade long paranormal investigation. Who or what is haunting Alice’s home? Find out on May 5th.\n\nThe official press details for the documentary tease, “This film is not only scary, but it’s also a thought-provoking look at what it’s like to live with a haunting. Bridging the paranormal, real science and the human experience, this documentary shows a detailed look at what could be the most haunted house in America.” You can check out the official trailer below.\n\nLearn more about The House in Between over on the doc’s official website.\n\nThe next installment in the Jurassic World franchise has received an official title today, with Universal announcing that Jurassic World Rebirth will release in theaters July 2, 2025.\n\nCheck out two first look images and the title announcement video below.\n\nUniversal previews, “This action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air.”\n\nHere’s the full official plot synopsis announced today: “Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.”\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Scarlett Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world’s three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that’s been hidden from the world for decades.\n\nMahershala Ali is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family.\n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool).\n\nGareth Edwards (2014’s Godzilla, The Creator) will be directing the new installment, with original Jurassic Park writer David Koepp returning to write the screenplay.\n\nThe next Jurassic World film will be executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Entertainment. Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley will produce and David Leitch and Kelly McCormick will also produce through 87North.\n\nExecutive Vice President of Production Development Sara Scott and Creative Executive of Production Development Jacqueline Garell will oversee the project for the Studio."
