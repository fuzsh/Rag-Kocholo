When he disobeys, the father unintentionally tells him he is unworthy of the name of Latimer and punishes him by sending him to his room. The boy runs away and an attempt is made to kidnap him, but a friendly doctor rescues him and brings him back home. His mother leaves with the boy--but the separation arouses the father’s love--and a reconciliation follows.” (<I> Motion Picture News, </I> 15 Dec 1923)",

The feature’s success proved to Tarkington that producer J. K. McDonald and director William Beaudine would do justice to his stories.

The 15 December 1923 Billboard mentioned Children of Today as another working title.\n\nAs stated in the 15 December 1923 Motion Picture News and the 22 December 1923 Exhibitors Herald, preview screening was held at the Stratford Theatre in Indianapolis, IN. The event was arranged by J. K. McDonald, who was transporting a print of the film to New York City. In attendance were Booth Tarkington, Robert Lieber, president of distributor Associated First National, and his associates, Herman and Carl Lieber. The 15 December 1923 Exhibitors Trade Review reported that another preview was held at the Plaza Theatre in New York City on 26 November 1923.\n\nBoy of Mine was released in January 1924, preceded by a New York City opening at the Strand Theatre during the week of 23 December 1923. The 19 January 1924 Exhibitors Trade Review reported that during the opening week, a free matinee for 400 children was sponsored by the New York World, which held a similar event the following week when the picture opened at the Strand in neighboring Brooklyn, NY. These screenings were said to be rare examples of cooperation between a New York City newspaper and a motion picture studio.\n\nThe 12 January 1924 Exhibitors Trade Review noted that First National arranged with music publishers M. Whitmark & Sons to print a new edition of the 1918 song, “Dear Little Boy Of Mine” by J. Keirn Brennan and Ernest R. Ball, with Ben Alexander on the cover. The film’s title appeared as Boy O’ Mine. An article in the 26 July 1924 Exhibitors Trade Review stated that Ben Alexander also inspired a line of boys’ clothing, duplicated from his costumes in Boy of Mine and Penrod and Sam. The so-called “Penrod clothes” were manufactured by Warner Brothers at 100 Fifth Avenue in New York City (no relation to Warner Bros. Pictures). The company kept track of the film’s openings across the U.S. and advised retailers on cross-promotional opportunities.\n\nA talking film based on Tarkington’s story was released in 1931 as Father’s Son (see entry).\n\nThe National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) included this film on its list of Lost U.S. Silent Feature Films as of February 2021.\n\nLess"
