        "text": "It’s time to fess up to an additional project I started on the sly a few years ago. It’s a book, maybe two volumes, on the films of Mr. Sam Katzman.\n\nKatzman produced well over 200 features and serials, ranging from the East Side Kids and Jungle Jim pictures to the Superman and (the second) Batman serials. His first picture as a bona fide producer was 1933’s His Private Secretary starring John Wayne. He’s even credited with coming up with the word “beatnik.”\n\nWhile a lot of Katzman’s output is written off as junk, he remains one of my favorite filmmakers. Others share that opinion.\n\nWhile plenty has been written about Sam Katzman here and there, as far as I can tell, this will be the first thing to make an attempt to cover everything.\n\nThere are so many books I want to write, I’ve got to either boost my production or live a very, very long time.\n\nTo share some stuff along the way, I set up a Facebook page for the book.\n\nA few days ago, over on 50 Westerns From The 50s, I posted a list of the Westerns released on DVD and Blu-Rays by Olive Films. Turns out a number of us are looking to fill some gaps in our collections — before they’re either gone or going for crazy collectors’ prices. And now, here’s a list of some of their other titles. This is by no means everything — just the stuff that falls within the scope of this blog.\n\nSome of these titles have already been re-issued (or are on the way) by other companies. But some may never see the light of day again, given the current state of physical media. From a couple of Republic serials to a handful of Regalscope pictures, there are some real jewels here.\n\nAs very special thanks (again) to Laura from Laura’s Miscellaneous Musings, who was a HUGE help with bringing this together.\n\nBetty Boop, Vols. 1-4\n\nSabotage (1939)\n\nS.O.S.

Olive Films put some terrific movies in our hot little hands. It’s a shame they didn’t make it. This proves the point that’s been made over and over on this blog — if we don’t support the companies that put these things out, they won’t be putting them out anymore. Okay, now I’ll climb down from my soapbox and put The Return Of Dracula back on.\n\nOur friends at Eureka in the UK are serving up some more 1930s and ’40s hi-def horror from Universal. There will be commentaries and other extras. Reaching for the pre-order button yet?\n\nMurders In The Zoo (1933)\n\nDirected by A. Edward Sutherland\n\nStarring Charlie Ruggles, Lionel Atwill, Gail Patrick, Randolph Scott\n\nThis Pre-Code gem is considered pretty ghastly, a reputation it gleefully deserves. Lionel Atwill is insanely jealous, and if you mess with his wife, there’s a good chance you’ll be eaten by tigers, bitten by a deadly snack or God knows what else. Bonus: Randolph Scott is in it!\n\nHorror Island (1941)\n\nDirected by George Waggner\n\nStarring Dick Foran, Peggy Moran, Leo Carrillo, Eddie Parker, Dale Van Sickle, John Eldredge, Fuzzy Knight\n\nDick Foran owns a tiny island off the Florida coast, complete with a castle and the legend of buried treasure. He sets up a fake tourist-y treasure-hunt cruise to his island, but when strange things happen and people end up dead…\n\nThis was originally paired with Man Made Monster (1941), for a perfect night at the movies.\n\nNight Monster (1942)\n\nDirected by Ford Beebe\n\nStarring Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Ralph Morgan, Irene Hervey, Don Porter, Leif Erikson\n\nThough they’re given top billing, Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill really have featured roles in this more-or-less remake of Doctor X (1932). Shot by the underrated Charles Van Enger.\n\nHouse Of Horrors (1946)\n\nDirected by Jean Yarbrough\n\nStarring Rondo Hatton, Martin Kosleck, Robert Lowery, Virginia Grey\n\nAfter playing “The Creeper” in the Sherlock Holmes picture The Pearl Of Death (1944), Universal decided to make the disfigured (due to acromegaly) Rondo Hatton their next horror star. He made two movies in 1945, House Of Horrors and The Brute Man. They would be released after his death in 1946. If you can get past how exploitive the whole thing is, the movies are as ghoulish and entertaining as other Universal horror pictures of the 40s.\n\nUniversal has always kept these films in tip-top condition, making Blu-Rays of these things a must. Each is a creepy delight — responsible for the rotted brains of lots and lots of monster kids (myself included). Highly, highly recommended.\n\nDirected by Walter Summers\n\nStarring Béla Lugosi, Hugh Williams, Greta Gynt\n\nClassicFlix is doing us all a big fat favor, bringing another Bela Lugosi picture — 1939’s Dark Eyes Of London (released in the States in 1940 as The Human Monster) to Blu-Ray.\n\nThough distributed in the US by Monogram, this is not one of Lugosi’s infamous “Monogram Nine.” This is a British adaptation of an Edgar Wallace novel. It was the first British film to receive an “H” certificate (for “Horrific”) from the British Board of Censors. Children under 16 weren’t allowed to see it.\n\nLugosi sailed over on the Queen Mary to do this one, shot in about a week. He has a dual role, as Dr. Feodor Orloff and John Dearborn, in this story of a series of murders traced back to insurance policies with the Dearborn Home For The Blind as the beneficiary.\n\nThis is great stuff, and I’m dying to see it in high definition. Coming at the end of February. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nMill Creek Entertainment has two new Blu-ray sets coming in December: Thrillers From The Vault: 8 Classic Horror Films and Sci-Fi From The Vault: 4 Classic Films. Today, we’ll take a look at the horror one.\n\nThe Black Room (1935)\n\nDirected by Roy William Neill\n\nStarring Boris Karloff, Marian Marsh, Robert Allen, Thurston Hall\n\nWhat’s better than a movie with Boris Karloff in it? Two Karloffs in the same film! He’s Anton and Gregor, sons born to the Baron de Berghman. One brother has some sinister plans for the other.\n\nThe Man They Could Not Hang (1939)\n\nDirected by Nick Grinde\n\nStarring Boris Karloff, Lorna Gray, Robert Wilcox\n\nThis set gives you Karloff’s “Mad Doctor Cycle” in high definition. This one is the first. Karloff invents an artificial heart, and after he’s unjustly hung, he uses it to exact his revenge.\n\nBefore I Hang (1940)\n\nDirected by Nick Grinde\n\nStarring Boris Karloff, Evelyn Keyes, Bruce Bennett, Edward Van Sloan\n\nKarloff’s anti-aging serum works with one deadly side effect — he used the blood of a homicidal maniac, which sends him on a killing spree.\n\nThe Man With Nine Lives (1940)\n\nDirected by Nick Grinde\n\nStarring Boris Karloff,\n\nKarloff has been trapped in a block of ice for 10 years. When he’s thawed out, he uses his enemy’s to continue his “chilling” experiments.\n\nThe Devil Commands (1941)\n\nDirected by Edward Dmytryk\n\nStarring Boris Karloff, Richard Fiske, Amanda Duff\n\nKarloff’s experiments capture the brain waves of his dead wife. All he needs is a body to put them in.\n\nThe Boogie Man Will Get You (1942)\n\nDirected by Lew Landers\n\nStarring Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Max Rosenbloom\n\nThe fifth, and last of Karloff’s Columbia pictures plays like a spoof of the earlier ones. He’s a mad scientist, of course, trying to create a race of superhumans (for the war effort) in the basement of an old inn.\n\nThe Return Of The Vampire (1943)\n\nDirected by Lew Landers\n\nStarring Bela Lugosi, Frieda Inescort, Nina Foch\n\nThis time, Bela Lugosi is brought back to life when a German bomb hits his grave and cemetery workers yank the stake out of his heart.\n\nFive (1951)\n\nProduced, Written & Directed by Arch Oboler\n\nStarring William Phipps, Susan Douglas Rubeš, James Anderson\n\nFive people survive an atomic blast and try to figure out how to carry on. This post-apocalyptic story was shot at a number of LA locations, including director Oboler’s own Frank Lloyd Wright house.\n\nThe Black Room and the Karloff mad doctor pictures are all great — and will be a real treat in hi-def. The Return Of The Vampire is also a lot of fun. Looking forward to Thrillers From The Vault: 8 Classic Horror Films.\n\nDirected by Tod Browning\n\nProduced by E.J. Mannix\n\nScreenplay by Guy Endore & Bernard Schubert\n\nPhotographed by James Wong Howe\n\nFilm Editor: Ben Lewis\n\nMusic by Herbert Stothart & Edward Ward\n\nCast: Lionel Barrymore (Prof. Zelen), Elizabeth Allan (Irena Borotyn), Bela Lugosi (Count Mora), Lionel Atwill (Inspector Neumann), Jean Hersholt (Baron Otto von Zinden), Carroll Borland (Luna Mora), Donald Meek (Dr. Doskil), Henry Wadsworth (Fedor Vincente)\n\nWith Mark Of The Vampire (1935), Tod Browning and Bela Lugosi set out to make their Dracula (1931) lightning strike twice. But since they were at MGM this time around, not Universal, a proper sequel wasn’t to be. Instead, Browning returned to his silent Lon Chaney picture London After Midnight (1927).\n\nWhen Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert) is found murdered, the local physician (Donald Meek) notes a pair of small wounds on his neck and decides a vampire did it. The mysterious Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) and his creepy daughter Luna (Carroll Borland) are suspected of being the undead, though the local police inspector (Lionel Atwill) doesn’t believe it.\n\nWhen Sir Karell’s daughter Irena (Elizabeth Allan) falls ill with the same sinister marks on her neck, an authority on the occult and vampires, Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore), is summoned to save Irena and destroy the vampires.\n\nThe working title for Mark Of The Vampire was The Vampires Of Prague, but the setting might as well be Transylvania. The plot is a pretty direct lift from London After Midnight — which like most humans alive today, I’ve never seen. (It’s a lost film.) But the picture’s visual style and having Lugosi onboard as the vampire puts Mark Of The Vampire squarely in Dracula territory.\n\nLugosi really doesn’t have all that much to do, but Lionel Barrymore has a field day as Professor Zelen, a standard Van Helsing kind of role. He’s all over the place, and he’s wonderful.\n\nScenes that hint at an incestuous relationship between the Count and Luna, and the Count’s suicide, were removed from the script. (The suicide accounts for the unexplained wound on the side of Lugosi’s head.) The finished film runs only 61 minutes. But what glorious minutes they are, with only the trick ending (Spoiler Alert) — with the vampires being actors employed to root out the real killer — threatening to spoil things. (Scooby Doo would do the fake-monster copout in every single episode, which infuriated me as a kid.)\n\nBut real vampires or not, the atmosphere here is very real, thanks to Cedric Gibbons’ art direction, the haunting “score” — which seems to be made up of ghostly moans and groans, and the masterful camerawork of the great James Wong Howe. Howe takes the mood of Dracula, which was shot by the incredible Karl Freund, to an entirely new level. Nobody lights a run-down castle, a rat or an armadillo quite like those two! Howe keeps his camera moving quite a bit, which was really difficult on these early sound films. After all, the camera was the size of a refrigerator! There are tracking shots along the castle’s staircase that will knock you out.\n\nIt’s these visuals that truly benefit from the exquisite new Blu-Ray from Warner Archive. They’ve worked their magic again on this one. We have an idea of what a film from 1935 should look like, influenced more by the shoddy ways we’ve seen them over the years. Now, it looks like it was shot yesterday. It’s flawless, letting Howe’s work really shine. There are frames from this movie I’d love to hang on my wall.\n\nThe Blu-Ray’s extras include a commentary, a short and a cartoon, but the real jewel is the original trailer. It makes great use of Lugosi, who speaks directly to the audience. He has 10 times more dialogue in this trailer than he does in the actual movie!\n\nI love 30s horror pictures, and seeing them look like this is a real blessing. A big thanks to Warner Archive for all the work that went into this Mark Of The Vampire. It blew me away. This one’s essential, folks!\n\nMan oh man, am I excited about this! Warner Archive has announced a couple of terrific 30s horror pictures for October release on Blu-Ray — Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde (1931) and Mark Of The Vampire (1935).\n\nDr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde\n\nDirected by Rouben Mamoulian\n\nStarring Fredric March, Miriam Hopkins, Rose Hobart, Holmes Herbert\n\nFredric March won an Oscar for this excellent pre-Code horror picture, which came way too close to being a lost film. When MGM started working on their Spencer Tracy version, they bought the rights to the March film and the 1920 silent version with Lionel Barrymore — and destroyed all the material they could find. Luckily, something survived.\n\nMark Of The Vampire\n\nDirected by Tod Browning\n\nStarring Lionel Barrymore, Elizabeth Allan, Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Jean Hersholt, Carroll Borland\n\nTod Browning revisits his silent London After Midnight (1927), adding sound and replacing Lon Chaney with Bela Lugosi. (Browning directed the 1931 Dracula.) Lugosi is at his Dracula-y best, Lionel Barrymore is a hoot as an expert on the occult and Carroll Borland is creepy as Lugosi’s daughter.\n\nThese played theaters in the early 70s along with Boris Karloff in Mask Of Fu Manchu (1932). What a night of 35mm wonderfulness that would’ve been. (Why didn’t my parents take me to this? I thought they loved me.) That’s the poster for the “terrifying triple show” up top.\n\nYou can always count on Warner Archive for exquisite transfers, and I’m really looking forward to seeing these look as good (or better) than they did back in the 30s. This is essential stuff, folks!"
