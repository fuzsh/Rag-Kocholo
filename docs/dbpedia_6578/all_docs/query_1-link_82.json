I hope you enjoy!\n\nTogether, Claire and Lucas set out for the town of Hush Falls, where her dad was last seen. Legend says that a tall man in a dark tattered coat lurks near the local reservoir, and anyone who gets too close to old Lemuel Hush is never heard from again.\n\nClaire and Lucas are determined to rescue her father. But how can they save him from the ghost of Hush when everyone knows that seeing the ghost means that you’re destined to die…\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI stayed up way late one night to finish this eerie novel. Claire absolutely does not believe in ghosts and she’s rather embarrased because her father is the host of a popular ghost hunting TV show. Everyone in school knows about it, but she can’t stand it. While her dad is out on another ghost hunting adventure, Claire runs into this strange kid named Lucas. He keeps following her and looking at her in such a weird way. Eventually they cross paths outside of school while Claire and a few of her friends are out in the woods. Even though she was a bit scared, she talks with Lucas and he tells her that he knows about ghosts and has learned that her dad is in danger. Claire is besides herself, struggling to accept what Lucas said, but she knows that her dad hasn’t answered any of her calls. After meeting Lucas’ grandmother, who is known to talk to the dead, Lucas and Claire travel to Hush Falls. Hush Falls is where her dad is supposed to be. There’s only one motel in the whole town and she cannot find him. So much unravels from here and it was quite intense because it was scary, but not scary in a sense where there was gore or anything traumatic like that. The town of Hush Falls is beyond creepy and I think Poblocki did a great job of describing it for the readers. This book is on the creepier end of middle grade mystery thrillers, but I do like how there was no rated-R scenes. The scares are supernatural and I think kids will enjoy that and want to keep flipping the pages, like myself! The end of the story was quite sad, but I do think Poblocki did it with purpose and I know the reader’s will want to read more from him after finishing this book! I would recommend this book for fans of Mary Downing Hahn, and readers who will enjoy creepy thrillers like Hide and Seeker by Daka Hermon and The Stitchers by Lorien Lawrence.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDan graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in theater. Subsequently, he toured the United States playing ultra-challenging roles such as Ichabod Crane in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Shoemaker in The Shoemaker and the Elves to packed houses filled with literally thousands of screaming children. (He hopes they weren’t screaming in fear.)\n\nDan now writes full time. He’s probably working on something new this very minute!\n\nThere’s always going to be a kid who loves a good thriller!
