        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\n🔪 'Giallo' 🔪\n\n'Giallo (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdʒallo]; plural gialli) is a 20th-century Italian genre of literature and film. Especially outside of Italy, giallo refers specifically to a particular Italian thriller-horror genre that has mystery or detective elements and often contains slasher, crime fiction, psychological thriller, psychological horror, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. In Italy, the term generally denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the film's country of origin.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, the term giallo often refers to the Italian film version of the genre, a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery thriller-horror film that usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. The genre developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades. (Some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.\n\nThe word giallo is Italian for yellow. The term derives from a series of cheap paperback mystery novels with yellow covers that were popular in post-fascist Italy.'\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nThere are different types of giallo mystery. Not all involve the search for a black gloved killer. In fact, one of the earliest templates for giallo films is the heated exploration of a love triangle (or quadrangle in the case of Giuliano Biagetti's 1969 entry 'Interrabang') that leads to some kind of crime, and there's a number of entries contained within the original cycle that spin such mysteries. An important film in the world of gialli, that's noted by fans of the genre for its influence, is Michelangelo Antonioni's pop art mystery 'Blowup' (1966).\n\nIn order to trap a group of people in giallo thrillers, high-end fashion houses were used by some directors; notably, cinematic stylists Mario Bava and Giuliano Carnimeo. Also in vogue were stately mansions which provided space, hiding places, antique ornaments and plush interiors.\n\nSome gialli introduce a suspect by means of warped psychological portraiture. A central target is often subjected to torment, abuse, confinement, and eventual isolation. The satellites orbiting this planet are potential victims, some incidental, some connected to the plot, some with their own secrets to hide. Common psychological themes explored by filmmakers within this context include paranoia, madness and alienation.\n\nAnyway, I created a list of my favourite giallo thrillers, using wikipedia and other reputable sources to qualify each film under this moniker.\n\n\"In the late sixties and early seventies, horror was undergoing another boom. The works of directors like Alfred Hitchcock, George Romero and Roman Polanski were redefining a genre that had almost died under the restrictive Hayes code. Meanwhile, over in Italy, a burgeoning film industry was establishing itself. Buoyed up by Hollywood investment and eager to throw off decades of fascist and religious repression, Italian auteurs began to look across the sea for inspiration. What emerged was the era of “Giallo”: Italian thrillers and horror films that oozed style and weren’t afraid to break taboos. Films like “Blood and Black Lace”, “The Bird With the Crystal Plumage”, “What Have You Done to Solange?” and “Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key” established a whole new genre of Italian cinema (as well as a tradition for having incredible names). The pulp cinema of Italy was a crazy funhouse mirror held up to American pop-culture. To Italian film-makers, America was a land of colour, excess and erotica, unbound by the centuries of tradition that had restrained Italian society. Giallo’s take on horror was stylish and bold to the point of surreality. Every woman was glamorous, and every man bold and boldly dressed. Every American was a rockstar, a famous author or a fashion mogul. Unlike the more realistic American films of the genre, the directors of Giallo weren’t afraid to mix high and low culture in their films, especially in regards to fashion.\n\nWhen it came to this blend of high fashion and pulp culture, no one did it better than the two masters of the Giallo: Mario Bava and his student, Dario Argento. Mario Bava’s seminal murder mystery “Blood and Black Lace” established the trend, setting its gruesome tale of dark secrets and deadly killers in the lurid world of a fashion house. It was a slick, beautiful film, filled with vivid lighting, decadent set-design and elegant outfits. With “Blood and Black Lace”, Bava established the visual template for Italian horror — but it was his protege Argento who took things to the next level. Argento understood that clothing and interior design were integral to the mood of a horror film. In his influential contributions to the genre, Argento worked closely with designers and fashion experts to construct the bizarre worlds of his films. The reality of Argento films is a heightened one, where even the extras seem dressed straight off the boldest catwalks of 70’s fashion. Just look at the opening scene from his famous witchy horror film “Suspiria”. Argento’s links to the world of high fashion only deepened as the years went on, culminating in his 1980’s horror film “Phenomena”, a film famous for its sumptuous costuming, as well as having a knife-wielding ape as an antagonist. Argento worked directly with Giorgio Armani to create the wardrobe for “Phenomena”; perhaps the most well-remembered garments are the crisp white outfits worn by a 15-year-old Jennifer Connelly. Following the film, Argento was approached by the small Italian fashion label Trussardi to direct their 1986 catwalk show. The show still stands as one of the most ambitious and fascinating approaches to fashion show choreography. Argento incorporated horror aesthetics, micro-narratives that established stories for each group of models that walked the catwalk, and even an on-stage (fake, obviously) murder, complete with the body being rolled up in polythene and dragged off stage by the next set of models.\"\n\n- Marcus O'Shea, Sleek : Fashion & Beauty\n\n\"I remembered watching the film from Alfred Hitchcock, \"Dial M for Murder,\" and he shot almost all of that movie in one room. There was a genius in what Hitchcock did by manipulating things in that room so that you could see the distances between things like the tables and the vases because of how he used perspective.\"\n\n- Dario Argento (speaking with Peter Sobczynski)\n\n\"I often think back on my career as having done a lot of Italian comedy, but what everyone remembers me for is for all the gialli, the horror films, from Mario Bava to Lucio Fulci, Fernando di Leo, Riccardo Freda, all films of terror or detective stories. Those are the films from my career that just seem to have stuck.\"\n\n- Dagmar Lassander, Arrow Films\n\nDagmar Lassander & Simon Andreu in 'Hatchet For The Honeymoon'\n\n'Much More' - Charlie, Pat & Rosy with Riz Ortolani\n\n- -\n\n'Vendetta'\n\nOne of the most striking overlaps when it comes to genre classification seems to be the global wave of crime horrors that were directly inspired by Wes Craven's rape revenge picture 'The Last House On The Left' (1972). Some Italian entries, like Romolo Guerrieri's poliziotteschi 'Young, Violent, Dangerous' (1976), steer through solid crime territory, but others walk a tightrope between crime and horror. I mention this because at least a couple of these films crop up on giallo lists with some regularity, but I've opted not to include any (instead submitting a separate list below).\n\n\"Wes Craven originally called the screenplay Night of Vengeance. Then it was Sex Crime of the Century, quoting a line of dialogue from the movie. Krug & Company, after the villains, was deemed not suitably ominous. Someone eventually came up with The Last House on the Left, which is ominous even though it doesn't make sense. (The house is isolated on a country lane with no other homes nearby.)\n\nCraven, a former English professor who'd dabbled in pornography (hey, who hasn't?), first envisioned Last House as a hardcore film, with real, unsimulated sex and even more graphic violence. It was after shooting had begun that Craven and his cohorts decided to tone it down into something slightly more commercial.\n\nCraven’s experience up to this point had mostly involved post-production work on documentaries and pseudo-docs, so that style—handheld cameras, not much \"art\" to the way shots are composed, on-location sound recording—was all he knew. It gives Last House an extra layer of realism.\n\nBesides the imitations and rip-offs it inspired, Last House also launched the careers of its writer-director, Wes Craven, and its producer, Sean Cunningham. Among other things, Craven would go on to make A Nightmare on Elm Street, while Cunningham was the man behind the Friday the 13th franchise.\"\n\n- Eric D.

The film turned out to be surprisingly successful and started a veritable fad of crime movies, known as Krimis (abbreviation for the German term \"Kriminalfilm\" or \"Kriminalroman\") which lasted until significant changes in the direction of the German film industry in the early 1970s occurred. Rialto soon acquired the exclusive rights to nearly all the Wallace novels, founded a German subsidiary company and, unconcerned by the many copycat productions by others, moved towards the artistic and commercial peak of the series in the first half of the Sixties.\n\nThere were 32 Rialto movies. Beginning with the fourth production Der grüne Bogenschütze (The Green Archer, 1960/61) all were under the artistic supervision of Horst Wendlandt and directed by Alfred Vohrer or Harald Reinl. These are the leading examples of the genre. Following Der Bucklige von Soho (1966), all of Rialto's Krimis movies were in color. Additionally, the original novels were increasingly disregarded in favour of new stories based on motives from the stories. On one hand, this departure made them seem more up-to-date – on the other, the dramaturgy, presentation and content quality levels declined rapidly. From 1969 onwards, Rialto Film started four coproductions with Italian producers to minimise their costs. Audiences increasingly ignored the series, which ended with Das Rätsel des silbernen Halbmonds in 1972.\n\nThe typical Krimi movie of the 60s contains a number of distinct stylistic traits, which not only makes the films a true series, but – seen in context with other, similar German crime movies of that time – marks them as part of a true film subgenre as well.\n\nIn particular, the two directors Harald Reinl (five movies) and Alfred Vohrer (14 movies) made their mark. While Reinl preferred long dolly shots /pans and exterior shots, Vohrer's films are known for their slight overacting and their distinct zoom and editing styles. Many of these Edgar Wallace krimis featured secretive, flamboyant, super villains whose faces were sometimes hidden from view, an archetype which would later become a staple of spy films in the mid-to-late 1960s.\n\nThe titles, which are usually the German novel titles, were intended to evoke the typical image of an Edgar Wallace movie. Most titles mention the villain, like Der Frosch mit der Maske (literally \"The Frog with the Mask\"), Der Zinker (\"The Squeaker\") and Der Hexer (\"The Ringer\"). More abstract titles usually feature the words Rätsel (\"mystery\" or \"enigma\") or Geheimnis (\"secret\"), for example Das Rätsel der roten Orchidee (\"Secret of the Red Orchid\") Das Rätsel des silbernen Dreiecks (\"The Mystery of the Silver Triangle\") and Das Geheimnis der grünen Stecknadel (\"The Secret of the Green Pin\"), while others hint at the location of the story, for example Der Fälscher von London (\"The Forger of London\"), Der Bucklige von Soho (\"The Hunchback of Soho\") and Die Tote aus der Themse (\"The Dead Girl in the Thames\").\n\nThe repeated casting of the same actors, generally for similar roles, is typical for the 60s Wallace movies as well. Among the most popular investigators are Joachim Fuchsberger, Heinz Drache and Siegfried Lowitz. Shady characters were mostly played by Fritz Rasp, Pinkas Braun, Harry Wüstenhagen and especially Klaus Kinski, while comic relief was offered by Eddi Arent, Siegfried Schürenberg and later Hubert von Meyerinck, or even Chris Howland. Additionally, well-known film and stage actors like Elisabeth Flickenschildt, Gert Fröbe, Dieter Borsche, Lil Dagover and Rudolf Forster repeatedly acted in important guest roles.\n\nThe location of the story is, like in the novels, mostly London and its proximity, with the characters mostly moving through old castles, mansions or country houses – even if the real sets were actually in Germany. Seedy night clubs, asylums, dark basements as well as, especially in later movies, girl's colleges and of course Scotland Yard, are popular main and side locations for Edgar Wallace movies.\n\nThe stories are very similar across the series as well. The plot is most often centered around one inventively masked main villain. In contrast to thrillers, the most important technique of creating suspense is the \"whodunit\". This means that it is generally unknown who the villain really is until the end of the movie. The motivations for the crimes are mostly greed, revenge, legacy hunting, and, especially in later movies, white slavery and the drug trade.\n\nNot unlike the later Italian subgenre of Giallo, the Wallace Krimi movies heavily center around the work of the police or a private investigator. Another typical feature is the heroine, who has to be protected from the schemes and misdeeds of the villain by the Scotland Yard inspector. This theme is repeated in virtually all Krimi movies and it is not uncommon for the two protagonists to be happily in love at the conclusion of the story.\n\nTo make the movies even more recognisable besides the typical introduction (usually a murder is committed before the film's title sequence), the title sequences were all in color from 1961 onwards, even if the rest of the film was in black and white. There are only two exceptions. Also, in 1962 the voiceover \"Hallo, hier spricht Edgar Wallace\" (\"Hello, this is Edgar Wallace speaking\") was added to the beginning of the title sequence in the German version.\n\nA very distinct trait is the score by Martin Böttcher and especially by Peter Thomas. Three of the four late German-Italian coproductions are even scored by Ennio Morricone. Little is known about the composer Keith Papworth, who scored Das Geheimnis der gelben Narzissen, except that he died in March 1992.'\n\n- 'Krimi' films at Wikipedia\n\n'Libido' (1965 - Ernesto Gastaldi & Vittorio Salerno)\n\n'Deadly Inheritance' (1968 - Vittorio Sindoni)\n\n'Death Laid An Egg' (1968 - Giulio Questi)\n\n'The Sweet Body Of Deborah' (1968 - Romolo Guerrieri)\n\n'The Laughing Woman' (1969 - Piero Schivazappa)\n\n'In The Folds Of The Flesh' (1970 - Sergio Bergonzelli)\n\n'Cold Eyes Of Fear' (1971 - Enzo Castellari)\n\n'The Designated Victim' (1971 - Maurizio Lucidi)\n\n'Slaughter Hotel' (1971 - Fernando Di Leo)\n\n'Amuck!'

One of my favourites is the frankly insane Don't Torture A Duckling: a kind of hallucionary whodunit, concerning a spate of child murders in a small Italian village. This movie is even more shocking than the gore-fests Fulci later became famous for (he would later jump ship to the zombie genre, churning out now infamous additions to the canon like Zombie and City of the Living Dead). Duckling's creepy, insular and superstitious depiction of rural Italian life won Fulci no fans at home; his vitriolic swipes at the Catholic church compounded his problems. Fulci claims he was blacklisted for a short time following the release of Duckling and the odd title was the result of Fulci's fear of a lawsuit from Disney (the original Italian title translates as Don't Torture Donald Duck which makes a lot more sense in the context of the movie).\"\n\n- Tony O'Neill, The Guardian\n\n'One On Top Of The Other' (1969 - Lucio Fulci)\n\n'A Lizard In A Woman's Skin' (1971 - Lucio Fulci)\n\n'Don't Torture A Duckling' (1972 - Lucio Fulci)\n\n'The Psychic' (1977 - Lucio Fulci)\n\n'The New York Ripper' (1982 - Lucio Fulci)\n\n'Murder Rock' (1984 - Lucio Fulci)\n\n'Don't Torture A Duckling' - Riz Ortolani\n\n- - - - -\n\n* Sergio Martino *\n\n'TORSO is the fifth and final giallo by under-appreciated genre master Sergio Martino.

The police’s only clue is a red scarf, which is probably intended as a mocking allusion to the red herring.

His work became hugely influential, and his zombie picture Nightmare City is said to have been one of the main influences in Robert Rodriguez’ Planet Terror (2007). Although according to another director/fan, Quentin Tarantino, Lenzi apparently didn't consider his walking dead as \"zombies,\" instead referring to them as “infected people.\" His other notable scary movies include Make Them Die Slowly, Eaten Alive!, Seven Blood Stained Orchids, and Eyeball.\n\nLenzi got his first taste for filmmaking as early as grade school, and later created film fan clubs while studying to become a lawyer. Eventually his love for film overtook his desire to study law, and Lenzi enrolled in Rome's Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografica in 1956. It wasn’t long before he began making movies. His penchant for working in different genres of film had more to do with the period when he was making films in Italy than anything else.\"\n\n- George Stark, SyFy\n\n'Orgasmo' (1969 - Umberto Lenzi)\n\n'So Sweet...

Known as the Master of Thrill and a Master of Horror, Argento made his directorial debut in 1970 and has since developed a reputation for graphic shocks and intense visual atmospheres. His mentor, Bava, might have pioneered the giallo, but it was Argento who honed the subgenre and claimed it as his own. For Argento, the gory passages of his movies are the best parts.\n\nBorn in 1940, Argento began his career as a critic and columnist for a local newspaper. From there, he transitioned into screenwriting, mostly spaghetti westerns which included notable credits like Once Upon a Time in the West. His 1970 debut, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, marked the beginning of his exploration of giallo and what giallo could be. Throughout the decades, especially the ‘70s and ‘80s, Argento carved out an illustrious career with his unique brand of horror. But he also helped usher in emerging horror filmmakers with producer work and collaborations.\n\nAll of which is to say, Argento has left an indelible mark on the genre.\"\n\n- Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting\n\n\"Dario Argento’s gialli often involved strange slices of pseudoscience (like the factoid from 1971’s Four Flies on Grey Velvet that the human eye retains an imprint of the last thing it saw before its host died), but Suspiria was his first foray into the full-blown supernatural. Lit by DoP Luciano Tovoli in garish reds, blues, greens and yellows, the film creates a world of queasy artifice that induces something like a hallucinatory synaesthesia in the viewer, to match Suzy’s own increasing sense of nausea and entrapment. The Academy is a place of sickness and rot, causing a mysterious illness in Suzy, and at one point even becoming infested with maggots.\n\nIt’s also a deathtrap, and a maze, with hidden interiors and deadly spaces – and the bodycount continues to rise, made of anyone who defies the will of instructors Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett). Everything draws Suzy closer to Markos, as the student, like some folkloric detective, follows a series of absurd narrative breadcrumbs to the elusive directress’ location. In that secret room, wizened evil will wrestle with innocent youth, and fairy tale logic will prevail, even as Suzy accidentally overturns and breaks an ornamental glass peacock in a symbolic act ultimately signalling Argento’s departure from the methodology of his earlier crime films (his 1970 directorial debut was called The Bird With The Crystal Plumage).\n\nSuspiria has been very influential, inspiring two direct sequels (Inferno in 1980 and Mother of Tears in 2007) and many a witchy fantasy or tale of balletic breakdown from other directors. It has even spawned a long-gestating remake due for release in 2018. Yet it is also, paradoxically, an inimitable singularity – a mesmerising, if confounding, danse macabre that treads that strange terrain between the psychological and the magical. It certainly marked the arrival of Argento as a master not just of the stylised murder set-piece (for he had already achieved that with his earlier, more conventional gialli), but also of the sensual and the surreal. Suspiria is a baroque piece of esoteric expressionism that you enter – and exit – without understanding so much as feeling.\"\n\n- Anton Bitel, Little White Lies\n\n'Deep Red' - Goblin\n\n'The Bird With The Crystal Plumage' (1970 - Dario Argento)\n\n'The Cat O' Nine Tails' (1971 - Dario Argento)\n\n'Four Flies On Grey Velvet' (1971 - Dario Argento)\n\n'Deep Red' (1975 - Dario Argento)\n\n'Tenebrae' (1982 - Dario Argento)\n\n'Phenomena' (1985 - Dario Argento)\n\n'Opera' (1987 - Dario Argento)\n\n'The Stendahl Syndrome' (1996 - Dario Argento)\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\n🪚 International Gialli 🪚\n\n\"The word “giallo” is Italian for “yellow” and is derived from a series of cheap mystery novels that featured a trademark yellow cover. The giallo film genre was heavily influenced by these novels and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. Visionary Italian directors Mario Bava and Dario Argento created and defined the genre with films like “The Girl Who Knew Too Much” (1963), “Blood and Black Lace” (1964) and “The Bird with Crystal Plumage” (1970). The later becoming an international box-office sensation. The financial success of the film gave birth to countless intimations and a new genre of Italian cinema.\n\nThe films all shared several distinctive characteristics: a murder mystery featuring a psychopathic stalker who wears black leather gloves and brutally murders a series of young beautiful scantily-clad woman with a sharp blade, explicit sexual content, whodunit storyline and graphic violence are infused with Italy’s tradition of operatic melodrama. The films usually feature a twist ending, revealing the killer to be a mentally disturbed madman or woman who usually poses as normal and subdued person.\n\nCritics have often looked down their nose at the genre and deemed it to be nothing more than sleazy exploitation cinema that erotizes murder. Many of the films are visually breath-taking, utilising elaborate set and costume design, innovative editing and flashy cinematography technics. The films are also known for their bizarre and sometimes baffling plotlines, seemingly placing greater importance on visuals and atmosphere than making perfect sense.\n\nThe only other country to officially adopt the genre was Spain. While the rest of Europe and Hollywood never officially embraced the genre, there is no doubting that it has had a prevailing influence over many of their filmmakers. Giallo is often cited as having been a major influence on the American slasher film. “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th” being prime examples. However, I feel that both those films lack the visual flair, style and eroticism to be classified as giallo-esque.\"\n\n- Dean Hesom, Taste Of Cinema\n\nMost film critics tend to think of giallo movies as purely Italian, which I feel is understandable. Slashers are regularly being made around the world but there's something about the distinct giallo style that seems quintessentially Italian. It's worth noting, however, that the giallo itself derived certain stylistics from German cinema, summoning expressionist horror and the krimi crime subgenre for inspiration. There was also an explicit overlap between the krimi and giallo, with international co-productions like the Italian-German entries 'Seven Blood-Stained Orchids' (1972) and 'What Have You Done To Solange?' (1972) cleverly building jigsaw pieces from both sources. If Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn delivers his proposed remake of 'What Have You Done To Solange?', it'll be interesting to see if he retains as many krimi elements as those of the giallo.\n\nComing back to the original question posed, I must confess, I don't think of any other country as significant giallo producers with just one very notable exception, and that's Spain. Germany had its own crime cycle with the krimi and the United Kingdom largely immersed itself in its own literary past when it came to translating crime fiction into film. France also had its own highly successful crime cinema industry in the 1960s, which came to be characterised by critics abroad for its uniquely detached Gallic style.\n\nPortugal's film industry was yet to open up, having undergone severe censorship in the time of Prime Minister Antonio De Oliveira Salazar who strongly promoted Catholicism. Salazar's successor, Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano, turned out to not be the reformer he'd made himself out to be in regards to art and censorship. Neighbouring Spain was a different case under the leadership of dictator General Francisco Franco as censorship actually softened a little in the late 1960s, allowing crime and horror filmmakers more room for manoeuvre. As Spanish cinema entered into a Golden Age of Horror, some genre directors initiated the Spanish giallo (similarly, the \"paella\" western came hot on the heels of the \"spaghetti\" western). Sadly, I've only seen a couple of Spanish giallo titles, though I'm hopeful that more will be released on dvd in future as most of the best Italian entries are by now available.\n\n\"Men, groups and classes see, observe things, study the events, under the light of their own interest. Only an institution has, by duty and position, to see everything under the light of everyone's interest.\"\n\n- Antonio De Oliveira Salazar\n\nI believe it's really worth the effort attempting to analyse the influence of giallo cinema globally, in light of the coming dominance of slasher cinema too. For this reason, I'd like to pick out a few movies worth considering.\n\n--\n\nGiallo Influence\n\n'Assault' (1971 - Sidney Hayers)\n\nSidney Hayers established himself as one of England's premiere crime and horror directors in the 1960s. He was an experienced editor with a talent for mounting exciting set-pieces on location. He directed 'Circus Of Horrors' (1960), 'Payroll' (1961), 'Night Of The Eagle' (1962), 'Revenge' (1971), 'All Coppers Are...' (1972) and a film I've not seen, 'Deadly Strangers' (1974).\n\nHayers' crime horror 'Assault' is based on a novel by Kendal Young, which was adapted for the screen by novelist John Kruse. It contains some surefire giallo elements which many viewers now pick up on. Hayers inspired fellow crime director Pete Walker to explore the use of giallo elements, which aided Walker in the creation of arguably the best run of horror films by a British director in the 1970s, consisting of 'Die Screaming, Marianne' (1971), 'The Flesh And Blood Show' (1972), 'House Of Whipcord' (1974), 'Frightmare' (1974), 'House Of Mortal Sin' (1976), 'Schizo' (1976) and 'The Comeback' (1978). I'd redommend seeing every single one of these films from Hayers and Walker as I feel they represent the very best of British genre filmmaking.\n\nLesley Anne-Down\n\n'Pretty Maids All In A Row' (1971 - Roger Vadim)\n\nFrench director Roger Vadim's crime horror 'Pretty Maids All In Row' is said to contain giallo elements by superfan Quentin Tarantino who lists it among his top 12 favourite films of all-time in 'Sight & Sound'. It's based upon a novel written by Francis Pollini which has since gone out of print. I too would rank this movie among Vadim's finest.\n\nAngie Dickinson\n\n'Sisters' (1973 - Brian De Palma)\n\nBrian De Palma's a master of suspense and he wisely draws inspiration from every artistic source imaginable. Dedicated superfan Quentin Tarantino listed 'Carrie' as one of his 12 favourite films of all-time in the same 'Sight & Sound' poll mentioned above, but I know he adores many of De Palma's excursions into crime and horror territory (they frequently overlap). The giallo influence can be seen during the opening set-piece in 'Sisters' and is maintained throughout a cycle that includes 'Obsession' (1976), 'Dressed To Kill' (1980), 'Blow Out' (1981), 'Body Double' (1984), 'Raising Cain' (1992), 'Snake Eyes' (1998), 'Femme Fatale' (2002) and 'Passion' (2012).\n\nMargot Kidder\n\n'Blue Eyes Of The Broken Doll' (1974 - Carlos Aured)\n\nThis is my favourite Spanish giallo, not that I've seen many. It's co-written by Jacinto Molina (aka. star Paul Naschy) and director Carlos Aured who was one of Spanish horror's great visual stylists. It's so good it makes me excited at the prospect of one day uncovering some of the other Spanish gialli produced in the 1970s.\n\nEva Leon\n\n'Eyes Of Laura Mars' (1978 - Irvin Kershner)\n\nThe American thriller 'Eyes Of Laura Mars' transplants numerous giallo elements into its New York setting. Director Irvin Kershner also draws inspiration from Lamont Johnson's crime thriller 'Lipstick' (1976) which carries its own curious fashion angle. The story's based on an early screenplay by John Carpenter entitled 'Eyes' (Carpenter co-wrote the script with David Zelag Goodman).\n\nLegendary German photographer Helmut Newton worked on this production which influenced a new wave of heightened erotic thrillers noted for their overt stylistics. Its use of fashion photography can be seen as a direct prompt towards the emergence of the designer thriller which became a big deal in the 1980s.\n\nI'd contend that films like David Schmoeller's 'The Seduction' (1982), Nico Mastorakis' 'Blind Date' (1984), Ken Russell's 'Crimes Of Passion' (1984), Abel Ferrara's 'Fear City' (1984), Richard Tuggle's 'Tightrope' (1984), Harold Becker's 'Sea Of Love' (1989), Mansour Pourmand's 'Zipperface' (1992) and Richard Rush' 'Color Of Night' (1994) all owe a significant debt to 'Eyes Of Laura Mars'. The same can be said for Katt Shea's 'Stripped To Kill' (1987) which ushered in a late night cable revolution based around the lives of employees of gentlemen's clubs and their shady clientele. With the success of Kristine Petersen's 'Body Chemistry' (1990), cable produced a glut of designer thrillers made to order, initiating several popular franchises.\n\nOn something of a sidenote, Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992) is an audacious, gender-based reworking of his own picture 'The Fourth Man' (1983). The film's Hungarian scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas' torched romances include Richard Marquand's 'Jagged Edge' (1985) and Costa-Gavras' 'Betrayed' (1987), as well as Phillip Noyce's 'Sliver' (1994) and William Friedkin's 'Jade' (1995) which further amplify the terror angle.\n\nFaye Dunaway\n\n'The Fantasist' (1986 - Robin Hardy)\n\nEnglish horror director Robin Hardy works here from an adapted screenplay written by playwright Anthony Shaffer, his collaborator on 'The Wicker Man' (1973), as they bring a novel by Irish author Patrick McGinley to the screen. The film carries elements of classical gialli, inflecting dark situations with the kind of nonchalent humour readily associated with the form.\n\nMoira Harris\n\n'Siesta' (1986 - Mary Harmon)\n\nThe existential crime horror 'Siesta' includes imagery redolent of classic gialli and is largely set in Spain. It's based on a book by novelist Patrice Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin's talented daughter-in-law), with a screenplay prepared by Patricia Louisianna Knop.\n\nEllen Barkin & Gabriel Byrne"
