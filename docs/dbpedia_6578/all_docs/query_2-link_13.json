When Frisbee announces that uniforms have been stolen, the imposters try to tiptoe out of trouble, but the ruse is uncovered and the five are sentenced to the guard house. Louie misses the noisy boys and resolves to join the Army again, but the recruitment officers refuse to enlist the old man.\n\nFrustrated by the boys' mischief, Frisbee runs through the rudiments of basic training with Colonel Hatfield, who has offered to be the guinea pig to set the example for the boys. Unable to complete even the simplest arms routine without offending the ranking officer, however, the five are thrown into the guard house again. An FBI officer visits Louie, requesting that he go to Washington to attend to important government business. Louie agrees to go and is asked to assist in flushing out enemy saboteurs at Army camps. Colonel Masters introduces a plan using the inventor of the hydrogen death ray as bait for the spies and reveals to the Pentagon officials that Louie is the ray's inventor. Advanced to major, Louie is immediately sent to Stockton to begin the assignment. Major Louie, using his new authority, has the boys assigned as his orderlies.\n\nNo sooner does he tell them that only he knows the missing key to the hydrogen ray than his secretary, the sexy blonde undercover agent Marsha Levers, having eavesdropped on the conversation, rushes out to share the news with two other spies, the gentlemanly foreign-born Decker and Conroy, at their desert hideout. Hatfield warns Louie of the danger and Louie, distracted by his feared fate, hands cash to the boys to take five female officers out on the town. The boys are interrupted in their romantic adventure by Frisbee, who sends them off crawling, stumbling and weaving their way through an Army obstacle course. The five female officers are left waiting, incensed that they have been stood up by privates. Later that night the exhausted boys are assigned sentry duty and accidentally enable the two spies to take Louie at gunpoint.\n\nHowever, within minutes the boys realize the predicament when they remember Louie's last words, \"routine 11,\" are a code for kidnapping. The boys jump in a jeep, drive off the grounds and stumble upon the spies's hideout and surprise them while they are trying to slap the formula out of Louie. Marsha arrives soon after and Sach, having been left alone guarding the captured spies, hands the gun to Marsha so he can join the others. When the boys return to the room, the spies threaten to pick them off one by one if Louie does not reveal the secret formula.\n\nAfter Louie calls out for a \"routine 6,\" antics ensue and two vases come crashing down, knocking the spies out. Upon their heroic return to camp with spies in tow, the boys are awarded medals for acting way \"beyond the call of duty.\" However, as the boys had to go AWOL in order to save Louie, Frisbee marches them straight back into the brig.\n\nGhost Chasers - April 1951 69 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Lloyd Corrigan as Edgar Alden Franklin Smith; Lela Bliss as Margo the Medium; Philip Van Zandt as Dr. Basil Granville; Bernard Gorcey as Louie Dumbrowsky; William 'Billy' Benedict as Whitey (as Billy Benedict); Robert Coogan as Jack Eagan; Buddy Gorman as Butch; David Gorcey as Chuck; Jan Kayne as Cynthia; Argentina Brunetti as Mrs. Parelli; Marshall Bradford as Prof. Krantz; Michael Ross as Gus\n\nSlip becomes interested in communication with spirits when a spiritualist moves into his neighborhood and fleeces old woman of their money. Slip and the boys go out to expose this fake\n\nUpon returning to his sweet shop, Louie stumbles upon Sach and Whitey, who are holding a séance in the backroom. Louie lectures the Boys and kicks Whitey and his equipment out. Later that evening, Sach and Whitey, still wanting to contact spirits, attend an séance with Margo the medium. A 300 year-old pilgrim ghost named Edgar appears to the film audience, warning them that real ghosts are only sent to Earth for important matters, like revealing Margo' s quackery. Slip discovers that his mother's friend, Mrs. Parelli, is desperate to pay Madame Zola $100 to make her deceased son Frankie appear before her.\n\nSlip, determined to reveal the deception, convinces Louie to hold a séance and bring back the ghost of Louie's wealthy Uncle Jake. During the séance one of the boys appears in disguise as Uncle Jake and borrows $100. Later, after Slip has given the $100 to Mrs. Parelli, the inconsolable mother visits Zola, who calls up the ghost of her son. However, the boys break in and expose the hoax. Questioned by Slip, Zola reveals that she works for Margo. Slip then forces her to set up an appointment with Margo for Louie to contact Uncle Jake. Later at Margo's, Louie reluctantly enters alone to meet with the medium.\n\nAs the rest of the boys look for another entrance, Edgar visits Sach and mysteriously opens a locked door for him. Sach soon discovers that only he can see and hear Edgar, when the boys return and call Sach insane because he is talking out loud to no one. While the boys case the house for evidence of Margo's hoax, Edgar leads Sach directly to the trick room, filled with paraphernalia to create the ghostly presences. Margo flips a hidden switch to start the record player but when the ghost voice on the album skips, Margo's henchman is sent to check the room. Sach escapes with the help of Edgar, who draws a chalk door on a wall and magically opens a real door into the next room.\n\nFinding the boys in the next room, Sach leads them into the trick room, where Margo's henchmen capture all but Sach. Once outside Sach and Edgar go in search of a phone and call for reinforcements. Meanwhile the henchmen drop the rest of the boys into a basement room that is quickly filling with water. In the séance room Margo receives hypnotists Professor Krantz and Dr. Siegfried and the professionals explain that hypnosis is a more secure method of manipulating her audience than her tricks. Soon after Sach and Edgar return and, with chalk in hand, Edgar opens a trap door in the basement room and frees the boys.\n\nThe boys immediately enter the séance room, where Krantz hypnotizes them and Margo's henchmen carry them into the storage room. As Krantz explains that he can only hypnotize those with normal intelligence, Sach wakes up from the spell but keeps still until the Krantz and his cohorts leave. Meanwhile Louie's ditzy cashier, Cynthia, and ineffectual private eye Jack Eagen, having just arrived, join Louie and discover Sach and the boys. Using an old witches' chant Edgar has shared with him, Sach releases all but Slip from the spell. After Sach slaps stubborn Slip back to reality, the henchmen return to dispose of the boys but they mount a surprise attack and triumph.\n\nLet's Go Navy! - July 1951 68 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Allen Jenkins as CPO Mervin Longnecker; Tom Neal as Joe; Charlita as Princess Papoola; Richard Benedict as Red; Paul Harvey as Lt.

To vindicate themselves, the boys join the Navy to find the crooks.\n\nSlip and the Boys raised $1,683 for needy Bowery families. Thieves Red and Joe, posing as sailors, rob them of the money. Slip notices that one of the men has a heart with the name \"Marie\" tattooed on his chest. The neighborhood thinks that the hold-up was phony and even Louie believes the Boys concocted the story.\n\nWhen police officer Sgt. Mulloy refuses to help the gang because there is no evidence to identify the robbers, the boys enlist in the Navy to find the robbers. A mix-up causes the gang to be signed up under the wrong names. The Boys are assigned to CPO Mervin Longnecker as deck swabbers. Sach, whose erroneous records show he is a qualified navigator, is assigned to the chart room. That night, the gang decides to check all the sailors for the tattoo while they sleep in their bunks.\n\nDays later, the ship docks in Hawaii and the gang visit the tattoo artist, Chief Narumo, to see if he remembers creating the tattoo. Narumo reports that he has no record of that particular tattoo, but gives Sach a parrot named Davie Jones. Back on board, Sach's continued antics force him to hide out in the cannon of one of the ship's guns to avoid punishment. When a firing drill commences, Sach is unaware of the impending danger, but Slip and the rest of the gang spot him and pull him out of the cannon just in time.\n\nLater Slip plays a few rounds of the shell game and is swindled out of all his remaining money. He leaves dejected, but Sach remains in the game, and with the help of the eagle-eyed Davie Jones, wins back all of Slip's money plus several thousand dollars.

Later, the gang receive commendations for their bravery and then return to the recruiting office to explain the false mix-up.\n\nCrazy Over Horses - November 1951 65 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Ted de Corsia as Duke; Allen Jenkins as Weepin' Willie; Gloria Saunders as Terry Flynn; Tim Ryan as Flynn; William 'Billy' Benedict as Whitey (as William Benedict); Bernard Gorcey as Louis Xavier 'Louie' Dumbrowsky; David Gorcey as Chuck (as David Condon); Benny Bartlett as Butch (as Bennie Bartlett); Michael Ross as Swifty (as Mike Ross); Russell Hicks as Randall; Peggy Wynne as Mazie; Sam Balter as Announcer; Leo 'Ukie' Sherin as Groom\n\nLouie is mad when the boys bring him a horse as repayment of a debt owed by stable owner Flynn. But Slip thinks the horse, 'My Girl', is a thoroughbred. The former owners of the horse, a bunch of gangsters want the horse back!\n\nStable owner Flynn owes Louie $250, so the Boys offer to collect the old debt. At the stable, mild-mannered Flynn explains that business is bad and he cannot pay. Flynn prevails upon them to accept \"my girl,\" as payment for the debt. Doc, who is responsible for the horse, has not paid room and board for My Girl in six months and it is Flynn's legal right to sell her. The boys accept the deal and Sach rides \"My Girl\" to the soda shop, where Louie is perturbed about the gang returning with a horse instead of money.\n\nAt the riding club, gangster Weepin' Willie arrives to collect My Girl, so Flynn sends him to Louie's. At the racetrack Willie informs Duke, the horseracing racket leader, that Doc, his employee, took off with the board money and My Girl has been sold to Louie. Duke's plan is to replace Tarzana, who has just finished last in a race and has suffered a series of losses, with look-a-like horse My Girl, a sure bet at 20 to 1 odds. Duke, Willie and henchman Swifty go to the soda shop and offer $500 for the horse, but when Slip finds out that they are willing to pay up to $1,000, he concludes the horse is a \"gimmick\" in a racehorse racket and refuses to sell.\n\nLater that night Willie knocks at the sweet shop door and distracts Louie while Duke and Swifty exchange Tarzana for My Girl. Later at his office Duke calls J. T. Randal, whose large bet rides on the My Girl ruse, telling him the \"trouble\" has been straightened out. The gang takes the horse to Sunnybrook, and Terry and Flynn ascertain that, though she has the same markings, the horse is not My Girl. Back at the shop Louie tells the gang about Willie's suspicious behavior and Slip assumes the horses have been switched and decides to switch them back.\n\nWhen the gang brings Tarzana to the racetrack stables and are about to make the switch, a police officer approaches. Sach and Whitey distract him, but the horses switch places in the stall and Sach takes Tarzana by mistake. Back at Flynn's, the handkerchief trick fails again and Slip is furious and kicks Sach out of the gang. The gang then drives to the racetrack stables and makes the switch, returning later to the riding club, where Terry confirms that they have the correct horse. Slip decides to run My Girl in the same race as Tarzana, thinking she will win.\n\nSach, unaware that the switch has already occurred, decides to make the switch himself. Wearing blackface, he takes My Girl to the racetrack stables and approaches the black groom who is walking Tarzana. While distracting him with antics, Sach switches the horses, bringing Tarzana back to the riding club. When the boys arrive back at the stable with Louie, Sach proudly announces his accomplishment, and Slip decides the only way to keep Sach out of trouble is to allow him back in the gang. That night the gang has secured the fee and the stall, but still need the right horse.\n\nSach finds Willie, and following a plan devised by Slip, secretly admits that the gang switched horses, forcing Willie to go back to Duke and tell him they need to switch again. After dark, Duke, Willie and Swifty make the switch back. The next day My Girl wins the race in a photo finish with coaxing from her jockey, Sach. Duke tries to escape but he and Randal are caught by the police and are taken away.\n\nHold That Line - March 1952 - 64 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones, a.k.a.

Sach develops a vitamin mixture that turns him into a star athlete\n\nAt the Ivy University alumni club, Stanhope argues that only students with \"blue blood\" can succeed at the college, while Billingsley declares that any student who tries hard can thrive. Stanhope agrees to wager a new addition for the chemistry building on the dispute, providing he is allowed to choose the students.. Spotting the Boys in Louie's sweet shop, Stanhope announces that he has found his test subjects.\n\nWhen Stanhope and Billingsley enter and offer the boys tuition and a $1,500 bonus they accept in order to give the money to Louie to bring his brother Morris' family to America. On campus, Dean Forrester is appalled to learn that such poor specimens were chosen for their experiment, but he agrees to let the boys matriculate. All-American football star Biff Wallace, his pal Harold and their girl friends, Wayne and Wells, greet the boys with equal amounts of amusement and dismay. In the lab, Sach concocts a potion that gives him almost super-human strength. When he then joins the boys on the gym field, he shocks the coach with his ability and is named the new track and field star.\n\nSach's subsequent status as campus idol angers Biff, especially after the boys join football practice and Sach easily flattens his competition. Sach, as \"Hurricane Jones,\" leads the football team to a victorious season, which culminates in a match against rival, State. Crooked gambler Mike Donelli realizes that if he can remove Sach from the game at the last minute, he can make a fortune by betting on State. He sends his girl friend, Candy, to ask Biff to introduce her to Sach.\n\nBiff, hoping to regain some of his former glory, agrees, and Candy easily lures Sach to her apartment. There, Mike and his goon, Big Dave, knock out Sach and then drug him. The game begins, and although the school laments Sach's disappearance, Biff leads the team admirably. Unfortunately, Biff is injured toward the end of the game, and when Slip congratulates him, a guilt-stricken Biff confesses that Sach is being held at Candy's.\n\nThe boys call the police and rush to the apartment, but although the gamblers are arrested, Sach cannot be awoken. Sach finally revives, but with no time left to mix up a new potion, the boys take to the football field without special powers. Luckily, Slip takes control and confuses State with a series of backfield maneuvers, allowing him to run down the field unnoticed. He almost fails to make the touchdown when he bangs his head on the goal post, but the other team shoves him over the line accidentally, and Ivy wins the pennant.\n\nHere Comes The Marines - June 1952 66 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones Jr.; Hanley Stafford as Col.

On his first day Sach impersonates a cook and almost kills a Colonel. The boys get involved without a deadly gang of gamblers who are preying on other Marines.\n\nSlip is drafted into the Marines and in boot camp, discovers that the rest of the boys have been drafted too. Slip finds his Sach impersonating a doctor and examining Col. Brown. For this offense, the boys are put on K.P. duty, and there Sach, of course, messes up the soup. Sach is sent to Brown's office, but once there, the colonel receives word that Sach's soup can be used as a weapon.\n\nBrown congratulates Sach and, realizing that Sach's father was his drill sergeant and friend, promotes Sach to sergeant. Sach's new position immediately goes to his head. On a hike, Slip discovers Pvt. Hardy beaten unconscious and after calling an ambulance, picks up a playing card lying near the body. The next day, Sach procures five twelve-hour passes and takes the boys out on the town. On the street, he woos Lulu Mae, who takes them all to a gambling house run by Jolly Joe Johnson.\n\nSlip, realizing the tables are all rigged, notices that the blackjack cards match the design of Pvt. Hardy's card. After Sach loses all his money, the boys plot to have him demoted. Slip places a fake bomb in Sach's arms as he sleeps and when he wakes, he disrupts the entire camp screaming that the enemy has attacked. Capt. Miller chastises Sach but, when he throws the bomb out of the window, it explodes. As a result Sach is promoted to staff sergeant and awarded a medal.\n\nPvt. Hardy dies and Slip visits the local sheriff and conjectures that Hardy was killed when he discovered Johnson's outfit was crooked. The sheriff, who is on Johnson's payroll, informs Johnson immediately and they decide that Slip must be quieted. Meanwhile, Slip and Sach also go to Brown, who puts two intelligence officers, Maj. Desmond and Capt. Harlow, on the case. Together, they all go to Johnson's to witness the crooked gambling but Johnson recognizes them and allows them to win.\n\nA dance is held next evening and Johnson sends Lulu Mae there to cause trouble for Sach. She sneaks into the barracks and hides in his bed, but when Brown hears a woman is in the camp and searches for her, she hides from him and then lets the boys into Johnson's closed gambling house. Slip searches the tables and discovers that each has a set of magnets underneath to move the chips and cards around. After they prove Johnson is corrupt, the boys are sent back to the camp. There, they discover that Brown has been replaced by a new colonel, who immediately demotes Sach to private and promotes Slip to sergeant.\n\nFeudin' Fools - September 1952 63 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Dorothy Ford as Tiny Smith; Lyle Talbot as Big Jim; Benny Baker as Corky; Anne Kimbell as Ellie Mae Smith; Oliver Blake as Clem Smith; Bernard Gorcey as Louie Dumbrowsky; David Gorcey as Chuck (as David Condon); Benny Bartlett as Butch (as Bennie Bartlett); Fuzzy Knight as Traps; Robert Easton as Caleb Smith; O.Z. Whitehead as Yancy Smith; Paul Wexler as Luke Smith; Russell Simpson as Grandpa Smith\n\nSach inherits a farm in Hog Liver Hollow, Kentucky. On their first day in the country the boys learn that the 'Jones' family is mortal enemies with their neighbor 'The Smiths'. Bank robbers end up at the Jones Ranch and the fun begins.\n\nA pair of private detectives comes looking for Sach to award him his inheritance: a southern \"plantation\" left to him by a long-lost uncle. The boys hop into their jalopy and head to Hog Liver Holler, where old hunter Traps leads them to the \"plantation,\" which in reality is a ramshackle cabin. Traps then reveals that all of the Joneses have been killed by the Smiths during a long-standing family feud. Just then, the hillbilly Smith brothers--Clem, Luke, Caleb and Yancy--begin shooting at the boys, but soon stop, unable to discern which one is the Jones they seek to hit.\n\nThe boys scramble inside to hide under a table, after which Slip volunteers Sach to patrol outside and orders the others to clean the cabin. Outside, Sach immediately runs into two of the Smiths and flees back into the house, where he sees each Smith brother framed in a windowpane and mistakes them for family portraits. Upon further exploration of the house, the boys discover a bootlegger's still containing potent whiskey. The Smiths continue to shoot into the house and, after refusing to accept a surrender, come inside, demanding to know which boy is a Jones.\n\nSlip lies that they are just city boys on a hunting vacation, after which the suspicious Clem coerces them into coming for dinner, reasoning in secret that the real Jones will expose himself by eating greedily, as do all Joneses. Later, the boys set out for the Smiths', but are stopped by pretty Smith sister Ellie Mae, who informs them of Clem's plan to trap them. She also introduces her other sister, the oversized Tiny, who takes an immediate liking to Sach. At dinner, the boys take small portions and eat fastidiously until the Smiths begin playing with their rifles, at which point Ellie Mae hurries the boys outside to protect them.\n\nThere, Sach tries to impress the women by milking a cow directly into a bottle and procuring chocolate milk from a brown cow. The next day, Sach and Slip ask local banker Thompson for a loan to renovate the farm, but Thompson refuses to give them money without collateral. Meanwhile, Louie travels to the Holler to join the boys, but is captured by the Smiths, who believe he is a revenuer. Ellie Mae informs the boys of Louie's predicament, spurring them to rush to the Smiths' and rescue their friend.\n\nSoon after, gangsters Big Jim, Pinky and Corky rob Thompson's bank, and when Jim is shot in the arm, they are forced to seek refuge in Sach's cabin. Although the gangsters claim to be hunters, Slip has heard about the robbery on the radio and deduces their real identity. Hoping to stall for time, he pretends that Louie is a doctor who can remove the bullet from Jim's arm. Louie tries gamely to act like a doctor, but when he attempts to use the whiskey as an anesthetic, it burns a hole through Corky's shoe.\n\nSach soon discovers the robbers' bag of money and, after Corky catches him trying to steal it, reasons aloud that the men are robbers, after which they hold the boys at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Ellie Mae walks over to the cabin, followed, unknown to her, by Clem. When she enters, Corky grabs her, but Slip sees Clem and loudly identifies each robber as \"Jones,\" prompting Clem to call for his brothers and begin a shootout. While the gangsters are busy shooting, the boys knock them out one by one.\n\nThe Smiths then force their way into the house, but when Slip explains that they have helped capture the bank robbers, they are proud to be on the right side of the law. The thieves are arrested, and the next day, Ellie Mae compels her brothers to dress up and apologize to the boys. At the cabin, they are joined by Thompson, who offers a bank loan as a reward for capturing the thieves. When Slip insists on signing for the loan, however, claiming that he is the \"Mr. Jones\" of the outfit, the Smiths draw their guns and chase him into the hills.\n\nNo Holds Barred - November 1952 65 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Marjorie Reynolds as Rhonda Nelson; Bernard Gorcey as Louie Dumbrowsky; Leonard Penn as Pete Taylor; Henry Kulky as Mike the Mauler; Hombre Montana as Himself (Wrestler); David Gorcey as Chuck (as David Condon); Benny Bartlett as Butch (as Bennie Bartlett); Sandra Gould as Mildred; Tim Ryan as Mr. Hunter; Lisa Wilson as Betty; Murray Alper as Barney; Barbara Gray as Gertie Smith; Leo 'Ukie' Sherin as Sam\n\nSach's cranium hardens bizarrely so that it can withstand any pain. Slip enters him into wrestling matches but the power begins to move to other parts of his body like his elbow, finger etc.\n\nThe Boys are in Louie's sweet shop when Louie is held up at gunpoint by a robber. Sach leaps to Louie's defense, and shocks everyone by barely noticing when the robber hits him repeatedly on the head with his gun. After the confused robber flees, Slip investigates further, only to be knocked out by Sach's head.\n\nA doctor confirms that Sach's skull has solidified until it is impervious to injury, but warns the boys that the superhuman power will probably not last long. Soon after, Slip sees a poster announcing that anyone who can beat wrestler Hombre Montana can win $1,000, and realizes that this is a way to put Sach's newly discovered power to work for them. The boys attend Hombre's next match, and after Slip secretly enters Sach into the competition, Sach attempts to escape but it is held inside the ring by the fight coordinators. Forced to defend himself against the huge wrestler, Sach takes Slip's advice to use his head, and knocks Hombre out with his skull. He then passes out, but the boys rouse him in the locker room.\n\nThere, Hombre's crooked manager, Pete Taylor, arrives to offer Slip $5,000 to manage Sach, but Slip is certain Sach is worth more, and so refuses. Instead, Slip uses the award money to set up a \"training camp\" for Sach in the back of Louie's shop, and hires trainer Mike DeMora. Slip then arranges for Sach, now called \"Hammerhead Jones,\" to fight \"Brother\" Frank Jares, but just before the match, they discover that Sach's skull is back to normal. The boys are crushed until Sach flicks Slip with his finger and, when Slip falls to the ground, realizes that the power has moved to his hands. Newly renamed \"Steel-Fingers Jones,\" Sach wins the match easily.\n\nHe then prepares to fight Ted Christy, and although the boys are concerned when Sach's fingers lose their strength, after he elbows Slip in the stomach, Slip confirms that the power is now in Sach's elbow. He wins the next fight and is promptly tagged \"Iron-Elbow Jones.\" In the heavyweight championship match, the power travels to Sach's toes, earning him the nickname \"Terrible Toes Jones\" and the championship belt. Taylor, frustrated at Sach's success, attempts to arrange a new match between him and Hombre. When Slip refuses the request, Taylor has Sach's next scheduled opponent killed and substitutes Hombre. Next, Taylor sends his girl friend, Rhonda Nelson, to seduce Slip into revealing where Sach's secret power is now.\n\nTo that end, Rhonda invites the boys to a party at her penthouse, where she leads Slip onto the porch for a private conversation. Meanwhile, Sach, while trying to evade an amorous admirer, inadvertently discovers Taylor hidden in a back room, and rushes to inform Slip of their imminent jeopardy. Taylor sends his goons after Sach, forcing Sach to disguise himself as a waiter. After finally managing to alert Slip to the danger, Sach hides his buddy under a serving cart and barely sneaks him out the front door. Desperate to discern Sach's power and allow Hombre to win the boxing match, Taylor has his men capture Slip and Sach, but, unable to find an area of Sach's body that isn't weak and flabby, they let the boys go. Slip and Sach join their pals in the locker room just before the fight, the proceeds from which go to the milk fund charity.\n\nAlthough Sach is terrified of Hombre, Slip convinces him to fight \"for the orphans,\" and Slip enters the ring. Just before the match, Slip pats Sach on the behind and realizes his power has been transferred there. Although Sach is too busy running from Hombre to hear Slip's advice, he finally bends over the ropes to talk to his coach, and Hombre knocks himself out on Sach's rear end. As Sach is declared the winner, he warns Slip they will need to be careful when choosing his new nickname.\n\nJalopy - February 1953 62 minutes - Directed by William Beaudine\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terrence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Bernard Gorcey as Louie Dumbrowsky; Robert Lowery as Skid Wilson (as Bob Lowry); Leon Belasco as Prof. Bosgood Elrod; Richard Benedict as Tony Lango; Jane Easton as Bobbie Lane; Murray Alper as Red Baker; David Gorcey as Chuck (as David Condon); Benny Bartlett as Butch (as Bennie Bartlett); Tom Hanlon as Race Announcer; Mona Knox as 'Invented' Girl\n\nSlip enters the boys jalopy in an auto race hoping to pay off Louies bills but comes in last. Sach develops a super fuel and the competition will do everything to get the formula\n\nRace car owner Skid Wilson urges driver Tony Lango and mechanic Red Baker to keep his racing \"jalopy\" in prime condition because he has been raking in money by winning at the track. Skid is curious when he reads that a new car has entered the race as the \"Mahoney Meteor,\" and that the owner is listed as Terrence Aloysius Mahoney. Skid sends his girl friend, Bobbie Lane, to learn more. Meanwhile, Slip and the Boys are testing the broken-down jalopy in their Bowery neighborhood. Louie begs them to move their noisy work elsewhere because it is ruining his business, but Slip reminds him that he will pay Louie's rent if he wins the jalopy derby.\n\nIn the back of Louie's store, Sach, while helping Professor Elrod Bosgood with an experiment, concocts a liquid that explodes when dropped on the floor. When Bobbie emerges from the smoke, the boys conclude that the formula makes women magically appear. Bobbie flirts with Slip and takes an interest in his car, so he gives her a pass to the next day's race. The Mahoney Meteor is so slow during the race that the other cars pass it repeatedly, until it boils over and Slip crashes the car into a wall. Sach attempts to help his friend but ends up chasing his hat all over the race track instead, which causes a massive pile-up.\n\nLater, the boys sulk over their loss at Louie's. Slip puts Sach to work waxing the floor while he tries to talk Louie into fronting them money to fix the jalopy and enter the next big race. Sach, meanwhile, puts some of his secret formula into the waxing machine and it literally flies through the window and into the sky. This inspires Slip to use the liquid in the gas tank of the jalopy, and in a test drive the car completes the track circuit in an astonishing eleven seconds. Having observed the test drive, Skid and his friends try to extract information from the boys, and Sach mistakenly reveals that he put a special additive into the gas tank. Slip and Sach report the good news to the Professor and get to work mixing up a new batch of the liquid. When Sach throws some on the floor, Bobbie reappears with an invitation to Skid's pre-race party.\n\nOnce the group arrives at the party, Skid sends Tony and Red to search their laboratory for the secret formula. After Tony and Red fail to find the formula, Skid takes the boys and Louie hostage in another room. Sach purposely drops some of the formula and he and his friends escape in the smoke. When they return to the lab they mix up another batch but are soon assaulted by Skid and his thugs, and a fistfight ensues. After Louie calls the police, Skid, Red and Tony seem to disappear. Once the police leave, the thugs return and are only satisfied when Sach's new formula proves ineffective. Sach later realizes he left out a crucial element of the formula: seltzer water. On the day of the big race, Skid is confident that Slip will lose. Once the race begins, Slip's jalopy putters around the track until Sach arrives.\n\nAfter pouring the liquid into the gas tank, the car's speed accelerates, but this time, in reverse. With Sach clinging to the side, Slip outraces the other cars by driving around the track in the proper direction with the car in reverse. When Slip wins the race, Skid tells Bobbie she will have to return her new fur coat. At a celebration at Louie's shop, Sach purposely spills some liquid after which a beautiful woman appears and leaves with Slip. Sach pours some more to create his own dream girl, but a bespectacled woman for the Professor appears instead. After Sach follows them out the door of the shop, Louie tries to create his own woman, but bursts into tears when nothing happens.\n\nLoose In London - May 1953 62 minutes - Directed by Edward Bernds\n\nFeaturing: Leo Gorcey as Terence Aloysius 'Slip' Mahoney; Huntz Hall as Horace Debussy 'Sach' Jones; Bernard Gorcey as Louie Dumbrowsky; Angela Greene as Lady Marcia; Walter Kingsford as Earl of Walsingham; Norma Varden as Aunt Agatha; John Dodsworth as Sir Edgar Whipsnade; William Cottrell as Reggie; David Gorcey as Chuck Anderson; Benny Bartlett as Butch Williams; Rex Evans as Herbert; James Logan as Hoskins the Butler; Alex Frazer as J. Allison Higby - Solicitor; Charles Keane as Bly; Clyde Cook as English Cabbie\n\nLawyers determine that Sach is a relative of a rich dying British Earl. The boys head to jolly old London and end up rescuing the Earl from the other relatives who want him dead.\n\nLawyer J. Ellison Higby gives Sach a letter in which he is identified as a potential heir to the estate of Sir Percy, Earl of Walsingham in England. The letter includes a first-class ticket for Sach to travel on a luxury steamship. Slip believes that Sach will need the support of his friends in England, and proposes trading in the ticket for four lower-class tickets for himself and the Boys. When Louie attends a farewell party in the Boys' cabin and is accidentally locked in the closet, the ship leaves port with Louie as an unwitting stowaway.\n\nAfter witnessing the captain's cruel treatment of another stowaway, the boys keep Louie's presence a secret, and Slip orders Sach to spend the remainder of the trip in a steamer trunk so that it will appear there are only four residents in their cabin. Upon arriving in London, Sach proves it was time well spent, by impressing his friends with his copious knowledge of London history, learned from reading a guidebook while he was trapped in the trunk. At Walsingham Castle, meanwhile, Sach's fellow heirs, Sir Edgar Whipsnade, Lady Agatha, Sir Reggie, Sir Herbert and Lady Marcia, are plotting to rid themselves of Sach, whom they perceive as yet another competitor for Sir Percy's fortune.\n\nSir Percy, however, warmly greets the Americans upon their arrival. Confined to a wheelchair, Sir Percy believes he is dying and announces that he hopes to get to know all his potential heirs and thereby make a fair division of his estate. The Britons hope that Sach's uncouth American manners will soon put him out of Sir Percy's favor, but Sach's good nature impresses and invigorates the elderly man. The British heirs then plot to kill Sach after he convinces Sir Percy to discontinue taking his medicine and to eat for pleasure. Both Sach and Sir Percy are unaware that the medicine is actually making him ill, as his relatives had planned, rather than making him well.\n\nWorking in collusion with the heirs, the butler Hoskins leads Sach and Slip to their rooms, and then frightens them with ghost stories. That night, Sach's fears are realized when a hooded figure with a hatchet attempts to kill him. After Sach is knocked unconscious by a helmet he had positioned over the bedroom door to stop an intruder, the hooded figure, actually Herbert in disguise, escapes. The next morning, Sach appears to have been invigorated by his deep sleep. Sir Percy's health continues to improve, and, no longer needing the wheelchair, he hosts a party to introduce his American guests. The next day, Sir Percy thanks Sach for his kindness and informs him of his plan to correct a two-hundred-year old injustice wrought by Sir Percy's ancestor, Sir Charles, against Sach's ancestor. Sir Percy recalls that the event occurred in the same chamber in which they now stand: Sir Charles had accused Sir Horace Debussy Jones and his friends of passing worthless I.O.U.s at an inn, and banished them to Manhattan in New Amsterdam. T\n\nhe friends were angry that they were being exiled to the colonies but were powerless against Sir Charles. Having recounted the story, Sir Percy now appoints Sach as his principal heir. Sach goes to tell his friends the good news but is distracted by Marcia, who seduces him into revealing his secret. Marcia and the other heirs then decide to kill Sir Percy before he can alter his current will. Slip, meanwhile, realizes that Sach's indiscretion has put Sir Percy in danger, and so the friends split up to search for the earl, who has disappeared. Unable to locate Sir Percy, Herbert and Reggie attempt to kill Sach, but he eludes them and stumbles into a torture chamber.\n\nSeveral more attempts are made on Sach's life until someone mysteriously knocks out both Reggie and Herbert. After Edgar appears and holds Sach and Slip, who has come to help his friend, at gunpoint, the mysterious assailant emerges and is revealed to be Sir Percy. Hoskins enters the dungeon and asks Edgar's permission to shoot the men, but when he is given the gun, he proves his loyalty to Sir Percy by turning the weapon on Edgar, Herbert and Reggie. A swordfight erupts between the men while upstairs, Marcia and Agatha lock Butch and Chuck in a room.\n\nDetective Ames of Scotland Yard arrives with the police, having been summoned earlier by Hoskins, and they arrest the women and free Butch and Chuck, who then lead them to the dungeon. There they find that Edgar, Herbert and Reggie are securely locked up in the stocks, and that everyone else is safe. Lawyer Higby arrives unexpectedly and announces that he mistakenly identified Sach as Sir Percy's relative, but that the true heir lives in Australia. As if this news was not painful enough, Sach is accidentally knocked unconscious by several cannonballs that slip out of their mounts. Sir Percy later congratulates a bandaged Sach for maintaining his dignity in"
