        "text": "It’s time to fess up to an additional project I started on the sly a few years ago. It’s a book, maybe two volumes, on the films of Mr. Sam Katzman.\n\nKatzman produced well over 200 features and serials, ranging from the East Side Kids and Jungle Jim pictures to the Superman and (the second) Batman serials. His first picture as a bona fide producer was 1933’s His Private Secretary starring John Wayne. He’s even credited with coming up with the word “beatnik.”\n\nWhile a lot of Katzman’s output is written off as junk, he remains one of my favorite filmmakers. Others share that opinion.\n\nWhile plenty has been written about Sam Katzman here and there, as far as I can tell, this will be the first thing to make an attempt to cover everything.\n\nThere are so many books I want to write, I’ve got to either boost my production or live a very, very long time.\n\nTo share some stuff along the way, I set up a Facebook page for the book.\n\nDirected by William Beaudine\n\nProduced by Ben Schwalb\n\nScreenplay by Jerome S. Gottler & Bert Lawrence\n\nStory by Edward Bernds & Ellwood Ullman\n\nDirector Of Photography: Harry Neumann\n\nFilm Editor: John C. Fuller\n\nMusic by Marlin Skiles\n\nCast: Leo Gorcey (Terence Aloysius “Slip” Mahoney), Huntz Hall (Horace Debussy “Sach” Jones), David Condon (Charles “Chuck” Anderson), Bennie Bartlett (Butch Williams), Bernard Gorcey (Louie Dumbrowski), Amanda Blake (Clarissa Jones), Dayton Lummis (Stuyvesant Jones), Ronald Keith (Terwilliger Debussy “Twig” Jones III), Gavin Gordon (Frisbie), Dave Barry (Palumbo)\n\nMy friend Dan Conway and I got to talking about The Bowery Boys a while back, which made me want to do a series of posts on the Boys and their movies. This is only the second. The best laid plans…\n\nHollywood loves to pit comics against the upper class — from the silents to In Society (1944) with Abbott & Costello to almost anything the Mark Brothers or The Three Stooges ever did to Caddyshack (1980). Guess there’s something just inherently funny about lowbrow boneheads tackling the highfalutin.\n\nThe Bowery Boys got their crack at the just-so world of the rich a few times, including one of their later pictures, High Society (1955). In it, the Boys run the Bowery Garage. Sach (Huntz Hall) finds out he’s the heir to the Terwilliger Debussy Jones fortune — so he and Slip (Leo Gorcey) head to the stately Jones mansion to take care of the paperwork and get Sach’s loot.\n\nBut it turns out it’s all a scam, part of a scheme to cheat the rightful heir, the young Terwilliger Debussy “Twig” Jones III (Ronald Keith) out of his fortune. By the time the picture’s 61 minutes are up, order is restored. Kinda.\n\nOf course, along the way we get plenty of Leo Gorcey mangling the English language and Huntz Hall acting like the world’s oldest six-year-old. And it’s all framed in the usual, ragged made-in-a-week production values we expect from Monogram (Allied Artists by this time) and director William Beaudine.\n\nAdded to this one is Amanda Blake as part of the wealthy Jones family. This was her last film before becoming Miss Kitty on Gunsmoke for the next 20 years.\n\nDave Barry is quite funny as a Liberace-ish piano player. He’s part of a sequence that shamelessly steals from The Three Stooges short Ants In The Pantry (1938). The Stooges introduced ants, mice, cats and other critters into a swanky dinner party in their picture. In High Society, thousands of flea get loose during Barry’s performance. The story is credited to Stooge veterans Edward Bernds and Ellwood Ullman, which might explain the similarities.\n\nThe Bowery Boys are an acquired taste. I saw these things as a little kid, so I’ve carried an attraction to them through my life. If I first encountered them as an adult, I’m not sure what I would’ve thought.\n\nHigh Society has a rather odd place in Hollywood history. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story — by mistake. (The only time that happened.) The film that was supposed to be nominated was the MGM musical of the same name starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Realizing the mistake, and probably getting a big laugh out of it, Edward Bernds and Elwood Ullman withdrew their nomination.\n\nHigh Society (the Bowery Boys non-Oscar-worthy one) is part of Warner Archive’s The Bowery Boys, Volume Two. This terrific four-volume series packs 12 movies on four discs in each set. They look terrific — High Society is even presented widescreen. Recommended. Unless you hate these things — in that case, you’ve been warned!"
