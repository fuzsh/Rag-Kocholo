Ghost Chasers is a short film made for our final year of our 2D animation degree.

The challenge was to create a short film that is both humorous and inspired by the conventions of horror. We were inspired by the cartoons of our childhood such as Scooby-Doo, Martin Mystery, and Danny Phantom.

Nathan is a fearful and introverted character, which is reflected in his design with his cap pulled down over his head, his fists hidden in his sleeves, and a small lock of hair almost covering his entire face. Camille, unlike Nathan, is a more open and extroverted character. Her design reflects this with a lock of hair sticking out from her beanie, her crop top revealing her belly button, and her bleached hair.

They are rather round characters, which recalls their kindness and gentleness, but also their youth. All of this also facilitates the animation.

The ghost is a rather angular character, stricter and colder. It's a character with a white line to make it stand out from the background and differentiate it from the other characters. He was a former maestro, as can be seen from his tailcoat costume.

To adhere to the cartoon style, we distorted objects and furniture in the backgrounds. For enhanced readability, we opted for a thin, irregular but predominantly colorful line to better highlight the elements of our backgrounds despite a dark environment in the mansion.
