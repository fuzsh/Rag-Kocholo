        "text": "Radically Smooth – Meze RAI Penta IEMs Review\n\nPros: + Great Ergonomics\n\n+ Aesthetics are top notch\n\n+ Clarity is great without being fatiguing\n\n+ Smooth sound with a natural edge\n\nCons: - Not the most impressive package for the price point\n\n- Won't work great for large ears\n\nRadically Smooth – Meze RAI Penta IEMs Review\n\nRAI Penta is an IEM or In-Ear Monitor from the Romanian producer Meze, which should be really interesting, but I will be perfectly fair to them, since I never got to review the Empyrean, which I really wished, so pardon me if I’m a bit too cold throughout the review, but I’m still a bit disappointed about that. The price point of the Rai Penta is about 1100 USD. It is made to compete with the best, so it will be put against Beyerdynamic Xelento, Clear Tune Monitors CTM Da Vinci IX, Dunu DK-4001, and Campfire Atlas. The pairing list will include FiiO M11, iBasso DX229 and QLS QA 361, all of which should make an interesting partner for the RAI Penta.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMeze is a company from Romania who understood one thing from the start, that the customer satisfaction, along with the marketing are really important things. They invested lots in their marketing, having friendly and quick personnel, and they also kept improving with every chance, they have some of the best warranty you can get worldwide, and they are known to be in top 3 most reliable companies out there. Their products are never priced the lowest out there, but you do get the support you deserve for what you’re paying, and that speaks volumes, as at times they are better than Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser in offering help to their customers, and I know for sure they are much better than Denon (check out my Youtube video for more about that).\n\nIt should be noted that I have absolutely no affiliation with Meze, I am not receiving any incentive for this review or to sweeten things out. I’d like to thank Meze for providing the sample for this review, with me being responsible for paying the custom taxes. Every opinion expressed is mine and I stand by it, the purpose of this review is to help those interested in Meze Rai Penta find their next music companion.\n\nProduct Link: https://mezeaudio.com/products/rai-penta\n\nAbout me\n\nhttps://www.audiophile-heaven.com/p/about.html\n\nPackaging\n\nFirst things first, let’s get the packaging out of the way:\n\nThe package is not the best out there, and if I can say that, it is a bit of a letdown. The package itself is not bad, and you have a beautiful carrying case, but it lacks extras like a secondary cable, and you mainly get the IEMs, a few pairs of tips, a cable, and a case. For the price point, most of the competitors either include multiple cables, or modular cables.\n\nIronically, the cables of most competitors are not better than the ones found on Rai Penta, so they somewhat make up for it, but for those who like large packages, even FiiO’s FA9 and FH7 come with larger packages, and with more extras.\n\nAll in all, Meze emphasizes the quality of the package and not the number of extras or the overall quantity, and the quality is top notch, from the cable, to the carrying case included with RAI Penta.\n\nWhat to look for when purchasing a high-end In-Ear Monitor\n\nhttps://www.audiophile-heaven.com/what-to-look-into\n\nBuild Quality/Aesthetics/Fit/Comfort\n\nThe build quality of Rai Penta is outstanding, they are a full metallic IEM, with vents so they do not have any driver flex, and the best part is that they are quite ergonomic. The shape does not include any hard edges or odd shapes, so the IEM has a smooth surface, sits nice in my ears, and would fit smaller ears well too. The aesthetics are also a ten out of ten, and Meze is known for being one of those companies who knows how to produce a beautiful IEM or Headphone, their 99 Classics and 99 Neo still being pretty good in the ~300 USD price points, and let’s not forget, those two pairs are the first I seriously reviewed on Audiophile-heaven many years ago.\n\nThe fit of the Rai Penta is even better when you take into account the flexible cable that does not conduct microphonics, and the cable should be worn over-the-ear, so you also get a secure fit. The passive noise isolation is not great, about 15 dB of passive noise isolation in practice, as they are quite open, and the vent that protects you against driver flex is quite large. This also means that they leak quite a bit, so you don’t get an IEM that isolates that well, but this translates to some benefits in the sonic quality department.\n\nThe connectors at the IEM level are high-quality MMCX, and they are better than your run-of-the-mill MMCX, the click is more secure, and you’re not likely to break them easily. The best part is that you can use aftermarket cables, like Dunu Hulk, or FiiO Silver cables, if you want to, and although Dunu Hulk is not in my top recommended cables to use with the Rai Penta, because both are somewhat thick and warm, I do recommend silver cables for them, for a plus of brightness and sparkle.\n\nSound Quality\n\nThe sound quality of the Rai Penta is generally great, but they have a very specific signature, which is smooth, relaxed, lean, detailed, yet unintrusive. The dynamics are a surprise, as they are quite dynamic, but for a signature that does have a lot of mid presence, and a rolled off treble, they sound much more detailed than most competitors, like for example, Xelento, which is incredibly smooth, but fails to have the definition of the Rai Penta. The different drivers have a vastly different decay, which blends in nicely. The tuning is made for listening rather than assessing the best technical performance, and they have a slightly easygoing type of signature, without losing that rich touch in between.\n\nThe bass is generally controlled, it is slightly warm and has a large decay, which makes it really easy to listen to them, as they have a really large sustain in between notes. It is not overly punchy, and it has enough warmth to apply some magic to music, but while acoustic instruments have a good depth and fullness factor, they aren’t designed for EDM and Electronic music, being a top choice when listening to Jazz, Pop, Downdempo, and higher fidelity music. Acoustic music works especially well, and everything that doesn’t rely on a bump factor in the bass will work out beautifully through the Rai Penta.\n\nThe midrange is the major strength of Rai Penta, with a slight dip in the lower midrange (500hz-1kHz), and a more forward plateau between 1kHz and 3.5kHz. Their presentation of a soundstage is rounded, with both depth and width extending vastly, like a mini HIFIMAN Arya. Guitars come through as musical, lean, and smooth without a texture emphasis, but a musicality and lean factor emphasis. The tuning favors male voices slightly, with a slight dark overtone, and music tends to sound relaxed coming out of Rai Penta, rather than dramatic and peppy. It is similar to Dunu DK-4001, which was tuned in the same style in general, although DK-4001 follows a more technical approach, where Rai Penta leaves everything to music and the effortless flow of sound.\n\nThe treble is rolled off in general, with the most presence being in the 7kHz-9kHz, the above still having some presence, enough for them to have air and width, but most of the soundstage relies on how layered music is in the 1kHz-3kHz. It is polite and smooth, the texture of the treble in general is meant to be relaxing, and there’s nothing that could offend even the most picky of listeners, although one could argue that this doesn’t mean that percussion lacks definition, it is just how a company wanted to be polite and smooth in the tuning until the very top end.\n\nYoutube Video\n\nComparisons\n\nThe comparison list could go on forever, since there is a large list of competitors, given the price point, but the most notable and important / relevant competitors are Dunu DK-4001, Clear Tune Monitors CTM Da Vinci IX, Campfire Atlas, and Beyerdynamic Xelento.\n\nThe price points of those IEMs are really close to that of Rai Penta, so all of the comparisons should come in handy if you’re looking for an interesting flagship when reading this review.\n\nMeze Rai Penta vs Campfire Atlas (1100 USD vs 1300 USD) – Campfire Atlas does not have a perfect package either, and at their price point they are also controversially minimalistic, but they do come with more, and better tips from the default, where Rai Penta does not come with spinfit or Final Tips. The fit is actually better for Rai Penta, as they do not have driver flex, which Atlas has, and they are smaller, but Atlas allows for both straight-down and over-the-ear wearing styles. The sound is quite different, with Atlas being much more energetic, more aggressive, more detailed, more grand, with a wider stage. The midrange is more natural on Rai Penta, and although they totally lack treble, in comparison, Atlas has a pretty peppy treble that can sometimes be fatiguing, you’re either going for smooth and lean, or V-Shaped, punchy and energetic between those two.\n\nMeze Rai Penta vs Clear Tune Monitors Da Vinci IX (1100 USD vs 2000 USD) – The package of the Da Vinci IX is much better than that of the Rai Penta, with a plastic, but better case, two cables coming from the factory, and with the 2000 USD price tag, they are much worse deal, and their price to performance ratio is much worse than that of the Rai Penta. The comfort is actually better on Rai Penta, and there is no driver flex on either, but Da Vinci IX is a bit larger. The sound is comparable, although on Da Vinci IX, it is warmer, more romantic, thicker, more bassy, and with a slightly higher treble presence, so basically a bit more engaging, more dynamic and more V-Shaped. Rai Penta is more lean, relaxed, smoother, cleaner in the midrange with less grain (Da Vinci IX is not grainy, but Rai Penta feels even smoother), and Da Vinci IX has a larger soundstage. For almost double the price, it is interesting to see how you’re getting some minor improvements, but not enough to recommend CTM IX over Rai Penta, even for those looking for a musical, lean, and smooth presentation.\n\nMeze Rai Penta vs Dunu DK-4001 (1100 USD vs 1300 USD) – DK-4001 has a very similar signature to Rai Penta, and it is priced much more sensibly, at 900 USD, almost 200 USD less than Rai Penta. For this price, DK-4001 has a better package, with a better, modular cable, more tips, better tips, and presented professionally. The comfort is also better on DK-4001 which manages to be more ergonomic, to have a slightly smaller body, and still have zero driver flex, zero cable microphonics, just like Rai Penta. The sound, though, is a bit more technical on DK-4001 with slightly less even harmonics, and more odd ones, with Rai Penta sounding smoother, sweeter and more musical, despite DK-4001 being already quite into this presentation. DK-4001 has a larger soundstage with a deeper space in between instruments, but Rai Penta sounds a bit more dynamic, and although DK-4001 has technically more detail, Rai Penta has an edge when it comes to micro details.\n\nMeze Rai Penta vs Beyerdynamic Xelento (1100 USD vs 1000 USD) – Xelento is a great example of how enthusiastic I was when I started reviewing, as it is a warm, smooth performer, with almost zero grain. Starting with the package, Xelento has a better package, with more accessories, but Rai Penta has the better fit and comfort, as Xelento has a pretty serious driver flex, and although they are not large, it is much easier to wear and feel comfortable with Rai Penta, than relying on the shallow fit of the Xelento. The sound is more detailed on Rai Penta, with more treble presence and air, and a bit more coherent sound. Xelento is smoother, but to the point where I often miss the treble in its signature, and although it is extremely warm, bassy, and full, I often find myself searching for an EQ to tune in a bit more sparkle. This does not happen with Rai Penta, which ends up being more balanced overall, more mid-focused, but without losing as much from both ends, and while the warmth and bass of Xelento surely make it a basshead’s favorite poison, Rai Penta will be a top choice for those looking for an easy way to enjoy a Jazz piece, some soft pop, or even some classical.\n\nRecommended Pairings\n\nThe pairing list will include some notable DAPs or Music Players, like iBasso DX220 running AMP 9, FiiO M11, and QLS QA 361. Only the best flagships are fit to pair with Rai Penta to get the best performance out of it, although they are not very sensitive to hiss, and they are fairly easy to drive.\n\nMeze Rai Penta + iBasso DX 229 (1100 USD + 900 USD) – When pairing DX220 with AMP 9, you have access to not only the best of audiophile tech in a DAP, but also the sound that makes it worth to order such an expensive DAP. There’s a magical midrange with DX229, and that midrange works especially well with Rai Penta, giving them a more musical and more detailed presentation. There’s also the EQ function which works very well on DX229, and I have to admit, more often than not, I find myself dialing in some bass and some treble to Rai Penta, but that’s just my guilty pleasure talking.\n\nMeze Rai Penta + FiiO M11 (1100 USD + 460 USD) – There’s no hissing with M11, which surely is a relief, since that was an important test for Rai Penta. Here’s one of the things that it got better than the Atlas, which has quite a bit of hiss with M11. In fact, even more recent Campfire IEMs are a bit sensitive to hiss, but more about that in the full video and in-depth reviews of them. M11 is bright, somewhat glaring, with a digital edge, and a wide presentation, and it pairs perfectly with Rai Penta, giving them a bit more air, more edge in the highs, less overall dark cast, and a clearer, more detailed sound with a better overall revealing ability. The stage is also wider, and the whole synergy is simply great, especially considering the price point of M11, you would find yourself a perfect match.\n\nMeze Rai Penta + QLS QA 361 (1100 USD + 800 USD) – QLS QA 361 is a DAP I know I don’t mention enough, but the support for it seems to have become sparse, and the company behind is not as open as I wish it was, so it is hard for me to tell what will become of it. Still, for those who either got it, or really fancy the design and build, the sound is still amazing, with one of the most gentle presentations out there, a beautiful overall detail level, and with no background noise. With Rai Penta, you have access to a truly magical pair, with a smooth midrange, smooth treble, effortless presentation with enough bass depth to be fun and with just everything that makes Rai Penta good, but without the compromise of it lacking detail, as QA 361 is detailed, yet musical.\n\nValue and Conclusion\n\nMeze Rai Penta surely is a questionable thing when it comes to its value, it costs 1100 USD, and you can totally find better value in other IEMs, even those that follow the same signature. Not to mention package that is better, like Dunu DK-4001 which is a much easier choice, but at the end of the day, just like when I reviewed the Meze 99 Classics, my first official review on Audiophile-Heaven, I can’t help but say that Meze Rai Penta is indeed worth the money. It isn’t the IEM itself, it is that smart tuning that was made with enough care and passion for us music lovers to keep coming back to it for a listen.\n\nOften it is much easier to recommend IEMs with great value, but Rai Penta is easy to recommend based on sound alone, although the build quality is great, it is a comfortable IEM, even for smaller ears, and it does not have any driver flex, microphonic noise, and it even manages to look cool.\n\nThe sound is smooth, relaxing, yet in a natural way, without losing the detail and technical ability in the process, just making sure to emphasize a natural sound that’s not unnaturally thick or bland, simply musical and lean.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you’re looking for what could be your next purchase as a musical flagship, if you appreciate both design, but also comfort, if you want to have a natural, slightly warm sound, with a liquid, musical midrange, and if you dislike strong treble, but still want some air, Meze Rai Penta makes an excellent purchase even now, and don’t forget to check with Meze, they sometimes include extra cables and specials with their IEMs and Headphones.\n\nFull Playlist used for this review\n\nWhile we listened to considerably more songs than those named in this playlist, those are excellent for identifying certain aspects of the sound, like PRaT, Texturization, Detail, Resolution, Dynamics, Impact, and overall tonality. We recommend trying most of the songs from this playlist, especially if you’re searching for new most, most of them being rather catchy.\n\nYoutube Playlist\n\nTidal Playlist\n\nhttps://listen.tidal.com/playlist/64555551-ec3c-4279-ae44-248fdfcf6c4b\n\nI hope my review is helpful to you!\n\n—\n\n---\n\nPros: Top to bottom clarity with no significant colorations or resonances\n\nAs comfortable an light as custom IEMS\n\nExtremely good spatial retrieval\n\nSuitable for Mastering/Recording Engineer use\n\nBeautifully cast and finished.\n\nCons: Inconsistent tip selection not suited for large ear canals\n\nDoes not ship with balanced cable\n\nThis review is of my personally purchased Meze Rai Penta IEMs and has not been solicited nor previewed by Meze. All opinions are my own. Meze offers the Rai Penta’s as a flagship IEM and their price at $1099 USD sets that expectation. The question is, do they deliver? Before starting I wanted to thank Andrew at Bloom Audio for providing excellent service in processing and shipping my order.\n\nWhile having been in many aspects of the audio pro/re-production as both a vocation and avocation for over 50 years, I do not cycle through audio components continuously. I can be satisfied in the performance of a system until such time as a significant step forward is both available, desirable and affordable. Until the Rai Penta’s, I had considered my HD800S headphones w/ Bifrost 2 and Jotunheim as my serious music listening system for those more personal times. The combination of sheltering-in-place and working-from-home has altered my listening habits and led me to seek a more flexible and portable comparable experience than available from my Westone W40s.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\nI was quite pleased with the presentation when unboxing and was thoroughly impressed by the Rai Penta’s level of design and finish. I had seen pictures, but you need to physically see and touch their exquisite craftsmanship.\n\nAnxious to begin listening, I checked out the array of tips.\n\nThis resulted in one of my few disappointments as I need large tips and none of the offered pairs provided a decent seal. While the double-flange tip’s outside diameter could be considered Large, it fails, as its widest point is at the bottom edge which is too close to the Rai Penta’s body to fully insert.\n\nIt is also made of very thin silicone that marginally seals if moved further up the nozzle. Fortunately, I had some tips from my old Triple-Fi’s that worked.\n\nNext came the cable, which has great flexibility and construction. Unfortunately, it is not balanced. Now I am not one for exotic cables, but it turns out that the Rai Penta’s really scale well with the additional power that a balanced output provides when using my FiiO M11 or Jot. Given that one can always adapt a balanced to unbalanced, I am disappointed that Meze chose to make the balanced cable optional and quite expensive at $150 given that it is 4-core, silver-plated copper litz construction.\n\nI do like the cleaning brush, 1/4” and airplane adapters. I also like the case’s construction and style; however, I just wish it was narrower in its front-to-back dimension as it is not pants-pocketable unless you’re wearing cargo pants.\n\nEven in unbalanced mode, listening to the Rai Penta’s was an unexpected experience. From the start, they did not present music as other IEMs, I have experienced. There is not the feeling of something closing off your ear. In its place is a wonderful openness very much inline with fine OTH open-backed headphones. This may be due to their innovative venting system, but in any case it makes a huge difference. This coupled with their extreme comfort results in an enveloping musical experience which is simply a joy.\n\nTIPS\n\nThe Rai Penta’s for me are sensitive to the type of tip used and its bore. Since I had to find after-market tips, I ended up trying a selection before settling on the ones that work best for me and my large ear canals. Now the Rai Penta’s have a large bore where the different drivers do not mix their output until your ear canal. Therefore, I was surprised that the default tips had differing exit diameters. I have gotten great results with 3 models - SpinFit CP450, Mandarine Symbio W and Azla SednaEarfit.\n\nAll three of these I have pictured and you’ll see that their output diameters are very close to that of the Rai Penta’s. I started off with the SpinFit’s\n\nbut now have exclusively moved to the Azla’s. This is not due to a difference in tonal balance but more from a comfort perspective.\n\nWhen wearing the Azla’s I get a great seal but quickly they “disappear” from any sense of wearing them. The Mandarine’s being a hybrid foam/silicone design provide the best isolation of the three and will be great for traveling; however, they do keep me aware of them.\n\nYou will note in the pictures, how all three insert deeper and have their widest diameter well away from the Rai Penta’s body for a great seal.\n\nTONALITY\n\nTurning to their tonal balance, I would like to describe them with a video analogy to set up my impressions and explanation. Please note that this is after two months of daily use. Any of you who are videophiles will know that there is the HDTV manufacturer’s default video mode (dynamic, vivid, etc.) and their “calibrated” mode (cinema, ISF, etc). If you have a quality HD/UDHDTV display calibrated as I have, you will immediately be struck by how there is less “pop” to the picture. The overall brightness is also noticeably lower and could even be classed as “boring”. However, once you live with that setting for a time, you’ll start to notice how it’s actually better balanced and has more visual detail without exaggeration. This is how I “view” the Rai Penta’s and their claim to TOTL status. The Rai Penta’s combination of openness and lack of colorations are qualities that take time to really appreciate and enjoy.\n\nMoving finally into my tonal listening impressions, these were primarily done with a balanced TRN 8-core silver litz cable using my M11 and Jot with 2.5mm/XLR adapter. My listening tastes are varied, but I do not generally listen to metal, punk. rap, or highly compressed recordings.\n\nInstead of the traditional bass, mids, and treble comparison, I’m going to focus on the Rai Penta’s actual instrumental and voice reproduction. The simple reason is that IMHO, performing frequency range-based comparisons, miss their real point. I’ve done many live classical and jazz recordings and believe I know what properly reproduced instruments and vocals sound like. If you are after this type of musical experience, read on.\n\nI cued up the SF Symphony’s performance of Henry Brant’s Ice Field (Binaural Edition) on SFS Media. While admittedly benefitting from its binaural recording technique, this piece and recording is an excellent test due to its full frequency and dynamic range in a hall and with an orchestra I am intimately familiar. The attack and decay of the percussion section, especially the double tympani and bass drums are real and matched what I’ve heard at Davies Symphony Hall. All of the aural subtleties were there with no discernible transducer resonances to detract from the musical event. The deep bass was actually startling as it was reproduced as it is in a large hall. When the piece gets very dense, the strings stay true to their tone. When the organ comes in a very sound effect way, the Rai Penta’s keep it distinct from the bass and percussion sections. I was struck with how like the Magico’s the Rai Penta’s sounded due to their lack of any resonances and colorations to detract from their clarity. I believe the choice of an all-aluminum body and sound tubes is largely responsible.\n\nNext, I cued up a recording that I have been using for over 40 years for equipment evaluation. The Atrium Musicae de Marid’s Tarentule~Tarentelle on Harmonia Mundi is an excellent collection of early music using original instruments and a simple stereo two-mic setup Its rich array of instruments are superbly rendered by the Rai Penta’s with precise placement and separation. The sharper harmonics of these period instruments are reproduced without any stridency or harshness added. Of particular note is Tarantela I & VI which shows off the group’s full instrumentation and on lessor transducers can become a cacophony. The Rai Penta’s kept everything sorted out.\n\nTurning to a more conventionally mic’d recording, I played Pray Sing Love by Eric & Ulrika Bibb on Dixiefrog. This is a very intimate recording with close mic’d instruments and vocals which due to the nature of Eric’s and Ulrika’s voices, shows up any midrange issues. The Rai Penta’s spotlighted their performances as a you-are-there experience without emphasizing the recording’s natural sibilance. Once again I was struck by their clarity, especially on You Were Made for Me and May Our Love. If you enjoy live recordings, the Rai’ Penta’s should definitely be auditioned.\n\nThis was reinforced when I next played Eva Cassidy’s Live at Blue’s Alley on Blix Street Records. This unforgettable song stylist (whose life was cut tragically short) is in fine voice during this 1996 live recording. It is a deeply personal performance and the Rai Penta’s convey her lovely voice infused with emotion and placing you in the club. This is especially true on the slower ballads such as Tall Trees of Georgia, Fields of Gold and Autumn Leaves.\n\nOne of my favorite Jazz/World artists is Jesse Cook. His latest album, One World, on Entertainment One brings a diverse set of rhythms to the performance. This recording has significant synthesizer bass that can easily overshadow the strings, sitar and guitars such as on Steampunk Rickshaw. The Rai Penta’s let you know the bass is there but kept it from coloring the other instruments and even did this better than I heard live.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nTo me, presentation (staging L/R, F/B, width) is dependent on an individual’s capability to translate aural clues and makes absolute judgements unreliable. I did evaluate the Rai Penta’s presentation not only on recordings such as those mentioned, but my own. I found I could happily use them as my live/mastering monitors because they conveyed the spatial cues necessary to place mics and balance ensembles. They do not create ambience nor do they emphasize what is there. This can make them appear more L/R and lacking in depth on recordings that have little or no acoustic, but I do not consider this a shortcoming. The Rai Penta’s are also capable of vertical diferentiation and thus present an “out-of-head” experience quite similar to good open-back headphones such as my HD800S. This was quite unexpected in my experience with IEM’s and resulted in my not missing my TOTL cans when listening to the Rai Penta’s.\n\nBALANCED VS. UNBALANCED\n\nI’ve included this section because it has been asked many times and I believe Meze should change its offering to match that of their flagship Empyrean’s where they offer a choice of cable type. These are after all marketed as their IEM flagship. Does it make a difference? To my ears it does but only at the frequency extremes or if you don’t have enough unbalanced power. While the Rai Penta’s 110db sensitivity and 20 ohm impedance means that most any amp will produce decent volume, I found that they do scale up nicely. When using my M11 or Jot and going from Bal tp SE I lose some bottom end extension and weight as well as experience a slight softening of the highest treble such as in snare drum, cymbal brushes and violin harmonics. Is this “night and day”? No, not even close; however, if you’re spending top dollar for IEMs, they should be equipped with cables that allow them to sound their best.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf you made it this far, you’ll have noted that my negatives have been about the accessories versus the Rai Penta’s themselves. This is because, I find nothing to criticize about their performance for my taste. I believe Meze has really achieved a top IEM here. Some may prefer chocolate to strawberry, but once you get beyond flavors you really begin to appreciate their clarity, freedom from colorations, and engineered comfort. They simply disappear and leave the musical performance as presented by your system. I don’t write many reviews; however, the excellence of the Meze Rai Penta’s deserve to be extolled. It goes without saying that, if you are looking for a TOTL IEM, whether custom or universal, you need to give these an audition. Take full advantage of their 60-day in-home trial as it takes time for them to fully reveal their excellence. Highest Recommendation!\n\nPros: natural detailed full-bodied sound tuning, beautifully crafted shells, compact ergonomic design and very comfortable fit, quality removable SPC cable, premium selection of accessories.\n\nCons: laidback sound presentation (depending on your preference).\n\nPentatonix harmony!\n\nThe product was provided to me free of charge for the review purpose in exchange for my honest opinion. The review was originally posted on my blog, and now I would like to share it with my readers on Head-fi.\n\nManufacturer website: Meze Audio. Available for sale directly or from Audio 46.\n\nIntro.\n\nCall me shallow, but when Meze Audio RAI Penta flagship IEMs arrived at my doorstep for review, I wasn’t in a rush to put them in my ears. Instead, I spent a good 10-15 minutes just looking at these little Romanian beauties and then continued while examining the custom case and the cable. And we are not talking about some exotic shell material or fancy custom finish. What caught my attention from the get-go was the design details of Penta’s uniquely shaped shells.\n\nOf course, it should always be about the sound first, with everything else coming in second as the icing on the cake. But when it comes to Meze Audio earphone and headphones, you can’t help but notice how hard they try to stand out both in the design looks and the sound quality. But looks can only get you so far before it is time to hear what’s behind the shells. That is exactly what I did after spending the last month testing and analyzing RAI Penta. Here is more about it.\n\nUnboxing and Accessories.\n\nConsidering how much thought goes into the design of Meze products, you should expect as much when it comes to the unboxing presentation. Starting with a packaging box, it has a textured wavy pattern surrounding the company logo and the model name on the top cover. Inside you have a foam inlay with custom cutouts to hold securely RAI Penta, all the eartips, and a custom shaped protective travel case. Yes, I’m a sucker when it comes to unboxing and I do enjoy accessories, especially when it’s something unique and custom.\n\nHere, you will find a ton of eartip pairs, such as soft black XS/S/M/L, a pair of regular double flanged and a two pairs of deep insertion double flange tips, plus a pair of Comply eartips. Considering a stock cable 3.5mm termination, included was also 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter which can come in handy when dealing with desktop equipment. You also get a cleaning tool with a brush and a long flexible cleaning whisker, a 2pin airplane adapter (that one is antique), stickers, and instruction manual.\n\nMy favorite accessory has to be a custom shaped protective EVA hard case. It’s not a real leather, this is EVA material, but it looks like a real leather and has a protective hard shell with a soft inner lining and a mesh pocket. On the outside, you have a metal Meze Audio logo and even a little loop to clip the case. Meze is always trying to stand out from the crowd with their unique designs, even if it’s just a case.\n\nThe included removable cable also looks nice. According to Meze, this is higher purity silver plated copper (SPC), 4 twisted wire conductors with each having 20 litz strands. The IEM connector is MMCX plug inside of clear transparent housing with a color mark for right side, and seem to be good quality. The cable has a flexible heat-shrink pre-shaped earhook, custom y-split with Meze audio symbol, plastic chin-slider, and a matching custom Meze audio branded connector plug. The stock cable comes with 3.5mm rhodium plated plug, and Meze also offers optional 2.5mm and 4.4mm balanced terminated SPC cables.\n\nDesign.\n\nWhile some IEMs standout based on the material and the finish of their shells, the first thing you notice with Penta’s in your hand is the unique shape. Milled from solid aluminum piece, the shells are very compact, have rounded edges with sexy wavy design lines, and a very comfortable ergonomic fit inside the concha area of my ear. While the surface of the shells is anodized, the milled Meze logo on the faceplate reveals the aluminum material underneath, and the same on the inner part of the shell where you have milled L/R letters, and 2 vents.\n\nOne of the vents, referred to as Pressure Equalization System (PES), has a unique drilled shape to control the airflow which regulates the internal chamber pressure around the driver assembly. And btw, absolutely zero dynamic driver flex. The nozzle also has aluminum finish with 3 precision milled sound bores that bring out the sound from connected internal metal sound tubes (also precision milled). You are not going to find typical plastic tubes and dampeners inside the shell, instead Meze uses metal sound tubes, each one precisely cut to control the amount of air volume in front of the driver.\n\nAs the name of this IEM suggests, we are dealing with Penta-hybrid configuration of DD and 4BA drivers inside the shell. Based on the internal diagram, 4BA drivers are split into groups of 2 each. While it wasn’t specified in the spec, I assume DD is for the bass, one pair of BAs is for the mids, and the other pair of BAs is for the high frequencies, with each group connected to its corresponding metal tube going to a separate sound bore at the tip of the nozzle.\n\nSound Analysis.\n\nI analyzed RAI Penta sound performance driven by LPGT while playing a variety of test tracks, such as Agnes Obel “The curse”, Sandro Cavazza “So much better” (Avicii remix), C-Bool “Never go away”, Ed Sheeran “Shape of you”, Alan Walker “Darkside”, Galantis “Hunter”, Iggy Azalea “Black widow”, Indila “Boite en argent”, Counting Crows “Big yellow taxi”, David Elias “Vision of her”, and Michael Jackson “Dirty Diana”.\n\nPenta has a natural full-bodied tonality with a nicely balanced signature. The presentation of the sound is slightly laid back, not too much in your face. I'm hearing a natural organic sound with a relatively coherent hybrid tuning, not too crisp or too analytical, but still will a decent amount of clarity and good retrieval of details. It doesn't stand out with super resolution or fun bass slam, it's more for a natural non fatigue enjoyment of the sound.\n\nBy the nature of Penta tuning, don't expect surgically separated layering of the sound with air in between, but you certainly should expect a distinct separation of vocals and instruments with the sound never getting congested or veil. This particular tuning is intended for enjoying the music rather than analyzing its micro details.\n\nSoundstage had a very good width and depth expansion, not exactly on 3D holographic level, but it creates a natural space with a convincing positioning of instruments and vocals. You can easily distinguish and pin-point every sound in space, nothing is exaggerated.\n\nLow end has a deep sub-bass rumble with a smooth analog texture that adds a fuller body weight under the mid-bass punch which has slightly above average speed/decay, not quite as fast as BA performance, but a little faster than average dynamic driver. The bass sounds natural and realistic, not super tight or very articulate, but with a very good control for a dynamic driver, without spilling into lower mids.\n\nLower mids are neutral and with a good amount of natural body which adds to an overall sound characteristics without adding too much to the thickness of the sound. It also creates a nice coherent transition from bass to mids, unlike some hybrids where you can hear a disconnect between DD and BAs. Upper mids have a good level of detail retrieval and natural resolution, never getting bright or thin. The lift around 2kHz is well executed and helps with clarity. It especially shines when it comes to vocals, both male and female, you can hear a very natural, organic, clear tonality.\n\nTreble has a good extension, decent definition, modest amount of airiness and sparkle, not too much, just a moderate amount without going over the top. You are not going to miss the details of your crash cymbals, but the sparkle and the sizzle will be smoother. This makes the sound non-fatigue, without a single hint of sibilance, great for an extended enjoyable natural listening.\n\nOnce you get into listening, sometimes you just forget this is a hybrid IEMs with DD and 4BAs, because tuning is very coherent, with all drivers working in a balanced natural unison.\n\nComparison.\n\nDespite the fact that Penta is 5-driver hybrid, it has a unique tuning that could be compared to other 5-driver hybrids, or 5, 8, or 10 driver multi-BAs which I'm going to cover in the comparison below. In every case I was using LPGT as my reference source, Meze SPC cable with 4.4mm termination and adapters (if necessary) to match other IEM; also, volume matched in every comparison.\n\nRAI Penta vs Campfire Audio Andromeda - the soundstage expansion in this comparison also has a lot of similarities, with depth being more out of your head while Penta's width is just a touch wider. Unlike the previous comparison with A91, compared to Andro I hear the same bass quantity, but not the same quality where Penta's bass is more articulate, having a little faster attack and shorter decay, giving it more control in comparison to Andro. But in general, the bass difference is not necessary night'n'day. Upper mids and treble is where I hear more difference. Again, with a focus around 2k peak which gives upper mids/vocals more crunch and clarity, Penta is more elevated and more forward, while Andro is pushed back and smoother and more laidback. But it reverses when it comes to treble where Andro is brighter and sometimes could get a little harsher in lower treble and has more airiness and more sparkle in upper treble, while Penta is noticeable smoother and more natural around the same peaks. As a result, Andro has a fun tuned signature with more focus around low end and treble, while Penta is more balanced and more naturally and evenly tuned.\n\nRAI Penta vs Westone W80 - this is another very interesting comparison, despite that I'm stepping up to 8-driver multi-BA. Here, the soundstage in both width and depth are very similar. With bass, like in Andro comparison, quantity is very similar, but when it comes to quality the Penta has a faster/shorter attack and decay, giving its bass a better articulation. Treble is also nearly the same, well defined and still quite natural and non-harsh. Mids is where you will hear the biggest difference. Lower mids have a little more body in W80, giving the sound more thickness. Upper mids, especially around that 2k peak, is where you have the biggest difference where Penta has more forward presentation and vocals with more clarity, while W80 has its vocals more laid back, smoother, more organic.\n\nRAI Penta vs Fidue Sirius A91 - the soundstage expansion in this comparison is close, with both having a similar depth with out-of-your head sound placement, but Penta has just a touch more width. The bass of A91 has a little more quantity, while the quality of the bass extension and impact and the balance between sub-bass and mid-bass are similar. Mids is where I hear more difference, especially in upper mids. Both have a natural neutral lower mids, and both have a similar peak around 2k, but Penta has this peak higher, making upper mids and vocals a little brighter and more revealing, with a slightly more forward presentation, while A91 has upper mids smoother, more organic, and slightly pushed back especially since A91 has a little more bass. The same with lower treble where 7k peak of Penta is a little higher than A91, giving the sound slightly more crunch. You can't help but notice similarities in these two IEMs, but even with their more subtle sound difference, I hear A91 being smoother, warmer, and a little more relaxed, while Penta is more transparent, more revealing, and overall having a little more balanced signature.\n\nRAI Penta vs EarSonics Grace - it has been awhile since I used Grace in my testing, but once I started listening to Penta, I felt it would be an interesting comparison. With soundstage, Penta has advantage of more width, while the depth is similar. When it comes to bass, Grace sub-bass extension and mid-bass slam is overwhelming more powerful than of Penta. Penta's bass is elevated for sure above neutral, but Grace bass hits closer to basshead level, shifting its sound sig even more toward L-shaped. As a result of this difference, Grace mids/vocals are not as forward and not as balanced when transitioning from low end to mids. Penta mids/vocals have a better balance and a little more clarity, but most of it due to bass being less overwhelming when compared to Grace. Treble is very similar, just with Grace having a little more sparkle, while Penta having a little smoother definition.\n\nPair up.\n\nRAI Penta has an average impedance (20 ohm) and a little higher sensitivity (110dB), still quite efficient and easy to drive from any portable source I tried it with. Also, I didn’t hear any hissing in the pair up examples I tried.\n\nLotoo LPGT – very wide soundstage expansion; balanced sound signature with a natural detailed tonality. Average speed, above neutral bass impact, natural detailed mids/vocals, well defined natural treble. This pair up probably exhibits the most balanced signature since bass impact is not as lifted.\n\nCayin N6ii w/E01 (Mode AB) – very wide soundstage expansion; balanced sound signature with a natural detailed tonality. The bass has a faster attack and more articulate punch, mids/vocals sound very natural and still quite detailed, and treble has a little more sparkle and airiness. Very good pair up which scales up the bass performance of Penta.\n\niBasso DX160 – very wide soundstage expansion; balanced sound signature with a natural detailed tonality. Average speed, above neutral bass impact, natural detailed more organic mids/vocals, and well-defined natural treble. Quite a balanced pair up here as well.\n\nA&K SP1000 SS – wide soundstage expansion; balanced sound signature with a natural detailed tonality. While with some other sources the bass goes deeper (more sub-bass rumble), here I actually hear stronger mid-bass punch. Mids/vocals sound smooth and natural, a little more laid back. Treble is also a little smoother in this pair up.\n\nShanling M0 – wide soundstage expansion; balanced sound signature with a natural detailed tonality. The bass is a little deeper in this pair up, average speed, more typical of DD performance, mids/vocals are smooth, laidback, detailed. Treble is smooth, and still well defined. This pair up sounds a little smoother and warmer, with deeper bass impact.\n\nFiiO M11 Pro – very wide soundstage expansion; balanced sound signature with a natural and slightly more revealing tonality. Bass here is faster and more articulate, with a performance which feels closer to BA rather than DD. Mids/vocals are still natural and detailed, but they do sound a little more revealing, slightly brighter. Treble also has a little more sparkle. Overall, this pair sounds a little more revealing.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S9 (w/HibyMusic) – the soundstage is above average, but not as wide as with some other DAPs. Tonality is smoother, a little less resolving, while the signature is still quite balanced. The bass does have a little more impact (more lift), mids/vocals are warmer, while treble is still well defined and natural.\n\nCable Rolling.\n\nFor those who are interested, here are a few comparisons to other cables I tried with RAI Penta. Majority of my cables are 2pin, thus I don’t have a big selection of MMCX cables.\n\nStock SPC to ALO Super Litz SPC – nearly the same performance, with an exception of ALO cable being just a little bit brighter. But other than that, nearly identical performance.\n\nStock SPC to DITA Oslo – also, nearly the same performance, but DITA cable is also a little brighter, especially in upper mids/lower treble. Surprisingly, it was even brighter than ALO cable.\n\nStock SPC vs Linum SuperBaX – this is first cable comparison which I actually liked over the stock cable. Perhaps due to a very low impedance of SuperBaX cable, the changes are more pronounced with a tighter faster more articulate bass and still natural but a little more revealing mids/vocals and a bit more sparkle in treble.\n\nConclusion.\n\nIt’s always a bonus to have a combination of beauty and brain, and that’s how I felt about RAI Penta. Of course, a beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the brain, which in this case the sound tuning, is subjective and depends on your preference. But you can’t deny, these are beautifully crafted IEMs with a natural detailed full-bodied sound tuning. To my surprise, I read a few polarizing impressions either praising or criticizing their tuning. If you want a big bass slam or extra revealing crisp treble details, the tuning of RAI Penta not going to fit your sound preference. Instead, RAI Penta has a more relaxed, more laidback sound presentation with natural detailed tonality and a balanced sound signature. I found Penta’s to sound great with any genre of music I threw at them, and personally I enjoyed their non-fatigue sound tuning over extended listening sessions.\n\nPros: Lush, immersive musicality; natural timbre, coherent warm sound, excellent construction and design, very comfortable, easy to drive\n\nCons: A little sloppy bass, average technicalities, lack treble crispness...\n\nMEZE RAI PENTA REVIEW :\n\nSOUND: 8/10\n\nCONSTRUCTION: 10/10\n\nDESIGN: 9.5/10\n\nACCESSORIES: 8/10\n\nVALUE: 6.5/10\n\nMEZE is mostly praise by audiophile for their headphones like the 99 classic and Neo. Sure, they got recognize too for their earphones, but I don’t think they get as much actively praised than the 99 Classic.\n\nStill, they aren’t new to earphones conception and already have a line up of 4 budget friendly model which consist of two 12 classic iem made of wood housing and two 11 NEO made of metal material. All of them sell for under 100$. Unfortunately I didn’t hear any of them but expect warm, lush bassy signature sound of MEZE.\n\nOne would think MEZE go in higher price range gradually, but instead they jump right up to the top and enter flagship earphones market with their latest iem offering call the RAI PENTA.\n\nPriced at 1099$, the Rai Penta is sure a luxurious iem few could afford. This hybrid earphones hide 1 dynamic drivers + 4 balanced armature in it’s rather sleek sexy body. Construction is sincerely exceptional.\n\nIt take 3 years for MEZE to come out with the PENTA they feel confident to sell, after numerous prototypes, the end result is nothing less than mind blowing.\n\nNow, let’s see in this review if it deliver a level of sound quality on par with it’s price range.\n\nDISCLAIMER : I wanna thanks MEZE for lending me the Rai Penta for rather long period of time. I was last on the list of loaner review and perhaps take too much my time...but i feel like Gollum with its precious treasure and hide myself alone on the top of a mountain with the Penta so nobody can stop me using it.\n\nSPECS :\n\nDriver: PENTA-HYBRID DRIVER\n\n(4 x Customized Balanced Armature and 1 x Dynamic\n\nDriver working harmoniously together)\n\nFrequency Range: 4Hz – 45kHz\n\nImpedance: 20Ω\n\nSensitivity: 110dB SPL/1mW Sensitivity\n\nMax Input Power: 30mW\n\nDistortion: <1%\n\nStock cables: MMCX connector ending in 3.5mm, Rhodium plated\n\nUpgrade cables: MMCX connector ending in\n\n2.5mm TRRS balanced and 4.4mm balanced as extra accessories\n\nWarranty period: 2 years\n\nACCESSORIES, CONSTRUCTION & DESIGN :\n\nUNBOXING experience is a luxuriously enjoyable one. You got a nice fancy box and when you open it you see everything you got for your 1K. Well, the cable is hide in the beautiful leather protective case but everything else is in front of you : the Rai Penta jewels, an impressive amount of eartips to be sure you find your proper fit (7 pairs of silicone and one pair of memory foams), a 4cores SPC cable, the elegant carrying case and a bunch of MEZE sticker for Fanboys like me. Okay, the boxing could have been even more luxurious due to high price range, but I have nothing to complaint about. Everything is there, yes an extra balanced cable would have been nice….but hey, it look like MEZE make a special right now that include an extra 2.5mm cable anyway!\n\nCONSTRUCTION of MEZE product are always preciously crafted, so my expectation for their top of the line iem was very high. And still, I'm in awe. If such thing like perfection exist, MEZE nail it with the Rai Penta housing. First thing that surprise me is how small it is for a multi hybrid iem. After this is how light it is for such sturdy looking all metal earphones. With iem in this price range I'm merciless about every aspect of construction and search for little details that can be negatively judged. One thing is about how the housing is durable in all way possible including scratch on it’s body. Well, the anodize cnc aluminum housing isn’t easy to scratch at all! Unlike DITA Fealty, Hifiman RE-2000 or Final Audio B1, you invest in a luxury iem that will not look like an old warrior full of battle scars after a year! The fact this review unit have been use by lot of other people and that I use it for a full month without ever using a carrying case and i can’t find a single little scratch on the body is supreme proof of how scratch resistant is the Rai Penta and yes, this is a big deal. The housing shape is sumptuous, with smooth organic curve, the dark blue colour is eye catching and reflect light in a intricate way. Body is make of 3 metal part, with a nozzle that have metal tube as well, so inner construction is as much carefully done than outside one. How the MEZE logo is engraved in housing is sumptuous too. Man, even the venting hole are artsy looking...I mean, i literally contemplate venting hole and find it beautiful with the Meze Rai Penta, I think it say alot about how refined are material used for construction.\n\nDESIGN can only be great if I praise that much the construction and I sincerely believe it really take 3 years of ergonomic research as MEZE state themself. This is a flawless design, that offer as much comfort than durability and beauty. It’s light, have smooth anodize aluminum shell with round curvy edge, the nozzle is neither too long or too short and even if it’s on the thick side it sit perfectly in ear canal as if it became a part of your body. With or without ear hook, the iem will stay still in your ears because of their perfect shape that embrace human anatomy.\n\nCABLE too is nice, not mind blowing like the earphones but a good high purity silver plated 4 cores braided cable similar to the one you get with Final Audio B1 or B3. Due to how unique the Penta look, i would have prefer an even fancier cable like a smooth 8cores SPC, but this is just a personal caprice. The cable is great.\n\nDRIVEABILITY is very easy. At 20ohm with high 110db sensitivity, anything will drive properly the Penta. In fact, Penta don’t like too powerful amping. Neither too low. I find them a little capricious about pairing in the sens they will benefit from clear source with high SNR. My best pairing is with my Ibasso DX90 at low gain, to my ears, soundstage gain deepness because of low background noise floor.\n\nSOUND :\n\nOVERALL PERSONAL SOUND APPRECIATION is mostly positive even if at this price range I sure judge more severely sound balance, tonality and timbre of an earphone. Even if MEZE did balance very well dynamic driver with 4 balanced armatures, it sure will have some limitation in soundstage and imaging that is inherent to this type of implementation and could only be avoid using very big housing, which the PENTA didn’t have. I’m not a pro about housing acoustic, but I think this explain overall thick dense macroscopic sound we have with the PENTA, to some extend it remind me a warmer, more refined and balanced BGVP DMG wich is a good value 160$ DualDD+2BA’s earphones.\n\nThe PENTA are slightly U shape sounding, with serious emphasis in sub bass which give a big thick slam, the lower mid range do get warmth a little, but in a good way which give vocal more density in body and presence even if overall clarity of mid range is a little too smooth in definition to offer a wider, clearer, airier vocal presentation. Cohesion of whole sound feel natural, more similar to what we would expect from a TOTL single dynamic driver that multi BA’s hybrid, this have a fluid muscular musicality that avoid any aggressiveness, well, if we don’t talk about weighty bass slam. You will not hear any sibilance in mids, no sharp peaks, its so lush and organic, yet it have good amount of details and well articulate layering. Now, here I think about Final Audio E5000, especially for how the treble is polished and laid back, giving smooth natural timbre which avoid any grain or harshness.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE is average for the price, it have rather good wideness but lack in both tallness and deepness, making overall presentation quite intimate.\n\nIMAGING is lower than average for the price, instrument separation lack air and space, it’s not very easy to define their placement and while it do not really feel congested even with crowded music, thick layering will make it sound less accurate in resolution.\n\nCLARITY isn’t at the highest level here, which explain why the PENTA make me think of Final Audio E5000, its warm, its thick, it’s not super transparent. If you expect vivid detailed and fast presentation from the Balanced armature, think again, because the BA’s in there make me think of Knowles BA’s sound which isn’t about high definition but natural, lush timbre.\n\nTIMBRE is how I like it : full and natural with well rounded density and just enough texture to make it sound smooth as butter.\n\nBASS is beefy without going into full basshead territory. It haven’t long transparent and super controlled extension we could find with more neutral iem like the DITA Fidelity, but a thick bumped sub bass mixed with lower mid bass, its very round to the point it’s more about authoritative slam than fast thigh punch. U shape in soul, but W shape with smoothed treble in nature, the PENTA have more juice to share than controlled vividness. Can’t say bass is boomy, but it sure isn’t a maestro of control and speed. This type of low end is great for cello which sound fuller as well as acoustic bass and synth bass, less so for fast slap bass and kick drum.\n\nMID RANGE have a lush laid back feel to it that strangely keep a good level of naturalness. Its dense, and seat on the bass with its thick presence. Vocal of both male and female are sweet and polished in upper mids, which avoid any hint of sibilance or harshness without overly affecting attack of other instruments. Piano sound round and smooth, with good weight but soft attack and not alot of realistic resonance, I really like how full bodied the piano is presented. Violin can play fast without loosing its pace, but definition will lack texture for some. Yep, we are in warm mids territory that deliver a clean well articulate sound, which is more about musicality than technicality.\n\nTREBLE emphasis is more in lower and mid region and begin a drop around 10khz, there no hint of aggressiveness and rather offer a smooth rendering with nuanced timbre and well layered details. Percussion are crunchy and well define, not pushed artificial forwards, giving highs good natural balance that sound opposite to clinical earphones without feeling it really lack in analytical approach. No splashiness, but not alot of sparkle either, you have as well minimal brilliance so I would not suggest the PENTA for fan of classical guitar, harp or harpsichord. Transition from low to mid to high is rather liquid, like thick hot transparent caramel. It really taste good, and sweetness isn’t unhealthy. This is organic old fashioned caramel, carefully homemade by your grandma. I reassuringly tasty, but sure, I would have like a little more spice in treble. Instrument like saxophone, electric guitar, violin and piano earn some extra attack speed when playing in this range, but again, with good hearted warmth to it. Cannot go better rounded than this, and this might be dream come true for treble sensitive people searching for revealing inoffensive listen.\n\nSUB BASS : 8/10\n\nMID BASS : 7.5/10\n\nMID RANGE : 8.5/10\n\nTREBLE : 8/10\n\nTIMBRE : 8.5/10\n\nCLARITY : 7.5/10\n\nSOUNDSTAGE : 7.5/10\n\nIMAGING : 7.5/10\n\nATTACK-DECAY : 7.5/10\n\nCOMPARISIONS:\n\nVS DITA FIDELITY (1300$) :\n\nHow could compare an high end single dynamic against the flagship triple drivers Penta?\n\nWell, let’s begin by saying it wasn’t that easy to compare both due to different amping need, Fidelity being seriously harder to drive and Penta being sensible to over power that can affect sound balance, it wasn't an easy task.\n\nNow, when it come to construction, both are fabulously crafted, but the Rai Penta win in term of comfort and fit, because the DITA is less ergonomic in shape and its earhook cable is thicker and can go off the ears.\n\nSOUNDSTAGE is slightly larger with the DITA, while the PENTA win in deepnest, but still have an overall more intimate presentation and this deepness clarity can be affected by bass veil.\n\nIMAGING tend to be more accurate and sharper with the DITA, especially in mids and highs, tough the lower bass is more easy to discern with PENTA.\n\nBASS is more U shape and emphases with the PENTA, its thicker, warmer, weightier and more muscular than the flatter, slightly dry lower end of DITA which have more energy in mid bass making kick drum less thick but more realist and textured.\n\nMID RANGE is warmer with the PENTA, its a little thicker and more opaque too, it will have more presence when there no sub bass bleed occurring but the brighter timbre of DITA tend to offer higher clarity, tough male vocal will sound thinner and female vocal can rarely create slight sibilance, attack for violin is faster too.\n\nTREBLE is more extended, sharper and more sparkly with the DITA, percussion are more forward and clearer, but this can affect overall balance and make the DITA sound a little more clinical than more mellow and natural treble response of PENTA.\n\nAll in all, PENTA is more bassy, warmer and lusher while the FIDELITY is more neutral, brighter and accurate.\n\nVS FINAL AUDIO B1 (700$) :\n\nBoth this earphones share similar warm, bassy and intimate soundsignature, but the B1 is more V shape and warmer. SOUNDSTAGE is similar, just enough wide to don’t feel stock in your head, but the PENTA are notably deeper as well as a little taller, make it more out of your head and spacious than B1.\n\nIMAGING is more accurate with crisper clarity with the PENTA, as if with the B1 your too near musicians to have proper instrument separation.\n\nBASS is more controlled and linear with the PENTA, it sound faster than more pumped up bass of B1 that tend to warm lower mids more than the PENTA. B1 have slightly thicker and juicier sub bass but it’s less textured than PENTA.\n\nMID RANGE is clearer, slightly brighter and more accurate with the PENTA, the presentation is wider and less intimate and prompt to congestion than B1. B1 have more mellow mid range, but female vocals are more prompt to (rare) sibilance, dynamic and attack is more energic with the PENTA.\n\nTREBLE is more extended with the PENTA, delivering crisper highs and more micro details on top, this make them more W shape while the B1 are more L shape with extra mids push. No doubt that the PENTA deliver higher definition, more texture and a livelier musicality.\n\nAll in all, the B1 will please those who search thick sound with lush mids and intimate laidback musicality, while the PENTA is clearly superior in technicalities, bass control and imaging.\n\nVS DITA TWIN FEALTY (1300$) :\n\nSOUNDSTAGE is slightly wider with the PENTA but we have notably more deepness and tallness with the DITA which make it sound more out of your head and airy.\n\nIMAGING being more spacious with the DITA, instrument separation have more air between them and tend to give clearer and more accurate positioning, as well, DITA have more transparency which benefit layering resolution.\n\nCLARITY is sharper with the DITA, especially in mid range where its clean from any bass warmth. TIMBRE is thicker, juicier and smoother with the PENTA, while the DITA is more bright and transparent. BASS is seriously more beefy, weighty and punchy with the PENTA, its thick and beautifully rounded even if it tend to warm lower mid range more than dryer, flatter and more textured bass of DITA. MID RANGE of DITA sound more revealing and fully covered, slightly more forward too, but with upper mids emphasis that while barely even make any micro sibilance, tend to offer a less smoothness than warmer, more opaque mids of PENTA. Here, DITA offer higher level of definition and clarity, making the PENTA sound less balanced and refined. TREBLE is a little more extended with the DITA, but extra micro-details we find is more due to higher level of clarity, anyway, highs have more natural sparkle-brilliance-decay to them while PENTA is again softer-dryier on top.\n\nAll in all, PENTA is bassier, warmer, more laid back and softer sounding while the DITA have better technicalities, more balanced near neutral sound and slightly brighter timbre that permit higher level of definition.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nMusically, the Rai Penta is a champion with it’s lush, thick, bassy and coherent sound. Technically, it’s less convincing with it’s slightly loose bass response, warm definition, smooth attack and average transient response.\n\nWhile I find sound value is in the low benefit return tangent, i think the extremely comfortable and well crafted Penta justify it’s higher price range to some extend. Why? Because we can’t expect high sound value with 99% of iem costing more than 1000$. Well, I still am searching for the one that can be consider as a versatile spectacular sounding end game iem. To be honest, I don’t think it exist.\n\nIn the other hand, the fact level of resolution isn’t analytical and choose to be lush and transparent instead of sharp and crisp make the Penta never aggressive or artificial sounding whatever music style you listen to. This could be a problem for metal or fast rock that need thigh punchy bass and fast transient response, but for most music like classical, jazz, pop, rap and electronic the result is very addictive.\n\nIf your wallet is thick enough and you search for a top of the line warm, laid back, bassy and lush sounding earphones with incredibly beautiful and sturdy construction, the Meze Rai Penta might become your beloved guilty pleasure.\n\nAttachments\n\nP1040871.JPG\n\nP1040862.JPG\n\nP1040854.JPG\n\nPros: Made by Meze\n\nFit-n-finish\n\n\"Affordable\" TOTL\n\nLaid-back signature does not offend\n\nExcellent fit for my ears allows long listening sessions\n\nDoes pretty much everything without offending\n\nCons: Meze did not take enough of a chance, like they did with the Empyrean\n\nMore bass wanted\n\nMids a bit too laid back (to me)\n\nDoes pretty much everything without offending\n\nTake a chance Meze!\n\nMeze Rai Penta ($1099): How does one follow the Empyrean?\n\nRai Penta website: https://mezeaudio.com/products/rai-penta\n\nSo…it begins. I will openly admit that until Andy sent a PM to those on this section of the tour, I had forgotten about the Rai Penta. I had forgotten I even applied. Shame on me for not keeping my notes up. Once the PM came though, I perused the reviews on this one. I often state that I do not for fear of jading my like/dislike of the item coming down my road. This was a case where I wanted to know what the kerfuffle was out in the yard. So, I peeled back the blinds to look in the yard, and of course my dog was chasing a squirrel. Anytime we say the SQ-word, she is a four-wheeler in action across our wooden floors, scratching for traction, and making any drifter worth their car jealous as her tail end slides gracefully out, but completely under control. Aussies tend to be that way…always in control and always passionate about the chase. I wouldn’t trade that for the world. We play hard, we fight hard, we snuggle hard. That is true love.\n\nThis would also describe my love for the Empyrean. For to me it was and will most likely stay the best headphone I have ever heard. That is until another of that weight ($) comes along. It will be tough to top, period. With that in mind as I read the reviews, I anticipated the passion, the sweat of labor, the meticulous craftmanship that would imbue the Rai Penta. For I look at Meze the same way I look at my beloved 1988 Richard Sachs. A one-man show and meant to be that way. Both Antoine and Richard share that passion for making the best (and cycling). There are others, which would give rise or claim to the top, but you do not mind, for you have found your passion and it is good. So, I waited. And a few short days later (spent seeking death as an upgrade to the sickness I felt from the first virus of the school year) the package arrived. I may do an unboxing vid, I may not. There will be a finale vid of course.\n\nI will add here in the introit, that my initial impressions were not what I expected. After the Empyrean, one has such lofty expectations, that to not be met is a disappointment. But that would be a disservice to the Rai Penta. I will add more below.\n\nSpecs:\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDriver: PENTA-HYBRID DRIVER\n\n(4 x Customized Balanced Armature and 1 x Dynamic\n\nDriver working harmoniously together)\n\nFrequency Range: 4Hz – 45kHz\n\nImpedance: 20Ω\n\nSensitivity: 110dB SPL/1mW Sensitivity\n\nMax Input Power: 30mW\n\nDistortion: <1%\n\nStock cables: MMCX connector ending in 3.5mm, Rhodium plated\n\nUpgrade cables: MMCX connector ending in\n\n2.5mm TRRS balanced and 4.4mm balanced as extra accessories\n\nWarranty period: 2 years\n\nAccessories:\n\n• MMCX braided cables made of silver plated copper\n\ncustom wires ending in high quality 3.5mm\n\n• Hard Case: protective EVA case with Meze Audio metal logo\n\n• 4 pairs of soft silicone eartips XS, S, M, L\n\n• 1 double flanged eartips\n\n• 2 deep insertion double flanged eartips\n\n• 1 pair of comply foam eartips\n\n• 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter\n\n• airplane 2 pin adapter\n\n• cleaning tool\n\n*Extra 2.5mm bal & 4.4mm bal cables included for testing.

I say what a load of horsecrap. I say this having what to me is the best box experience ever with the CTM Da Vinci X. You want fabulous, meticulous, informative? The CTM box is a cornucopia of sensual emotions as you peruse Da Vinci, and the makings of that beauty. Campfire Audio is another where the presentation is quite nice, replete with starlit night and camping. Two awesome boxes.\n\nThat said, I had taken as much pleasure from the Unique Melody presentation, with the UM logo embossed and sunken in as the previous iterations. The Meze melds simplicity with organic shapes and features. Some killer pictures can be had, which are quite psychedelic as well. Sometimes to take a trip, one must be tripping. Well done, Meze in the simplicity. I like it.\n\nOn the back is an overlay (think old Anatomy overlays used to study A&P), complete with exploded view. Of particular jocularity are the BA’s marked “brilliance” and “beyond brilliance.” I know that the intention is for description of frequency reach, but one surely thinks of the movie Spinal Tap and one of the greatest lines ever, “but this one has 11.” An idiot’s response shrouded in brilliance. Editor’s note: one would never insinuate that Meze is close to idiocy, but one draws inspiration from being close to that line. Sometimes brilliance does come from the actions deemed idiocy…just saying.\n\nOpening the box, and you find a quite nice presentation, with the leather oddball shaped case (think clamshell) below, and the IEM’s sheltered by themselves up top. Presentation is top notch and simple. Yet again, we see genius at work. The included accessories are impressive, and worthy of a TOTL IEM. Of note is the clean your inner ear length pick on the end of the cleaner. I have never seen a fiber that long on a cleaner and I would almost be afraid to use it, for making it all the way to the drivers. One is always careful with their gear though, right?\n\nBuild quality:\n\nThis get a separate heading here, not usually accorded me in others. I do so knowing the stellar build and fit-finish of the Empyrean. And yes, the Rai Penta is equal. Made of two halves and a longer-than-normal nozzle (GOOD!), the build is exquisite. I like the shape for it presents an almost “shelf” with which to grab ahold of the IEM on insertion. A guide into the ear almost. The color is superb of the anodization. I like the deep dark blue green (less green). Think Seattle Seahawks jerseys. Understated, but elegant. The silver-plated copper wire reminds me of the Campfire Audio Litz cables. Soft, supple and not prone to tangle. Typical Meze greenish brown colors adorn the splitter and jack. The former has the Meze triton, the latter the Meze Audio label and size. My only regret is that the cinch above the splitter is plastic. I would have liked another of Meze’s little trinkets to adorn the spot. Picky I know…\n\nTwo vent holes are on the inside, one with a tri-shape Benz-like emblem, with holes between. The other a smaller hole. You see the bare metal, which may be off-putting, but when you consider the company, you know there be not worry, mate. A top-notch effort, with no obvious flaws.\n\nFit-n-finish (less finish, more fit):\n\nAs one might expect from Meze’s history, the fit and finish are quite good. No mismatches, and the cover does not promote fingerprints. I do rather enjoy the color as well.\n\nThe fit is very good as well. With a smaller shaped housing, the Rai Penta fits fairly deep into my ear, without bother. The nozzle while longer than some does not dig in anywhere. Using the enclosed medium foam tips, the fit was good, but I did wish for a bit more isolation. It is good, but for the shape this is, I want a bit more. Silicon’s fit just fine, so getting the right fit should be easy. I was able to wear the Rai’s for extended listening sessions with either tip. No problem. Not even from the pre-formed ear guide. Longer than some, but not with the excruciating bend of the UM Mentor V3, the Rai Penta is made for long sessions. It also helps that the supple cable feel is pretty much tangle free. I have another in house right now, which has a cable that tangles at the mere suggestion. I use that for running as well, and must use my armband, with the cable tucked under my shirt. Not so with the Rai Penta (and NO, I did not go running with it…sheesh), it lays nicely and out of the way. I do wish the cinch above the very nice y-splitter was also metal. Adding the traditional Meze logo would have been boss. Semantics…\n\nSound:\n\nI put the Rai Penta away for a couple of days. I listened to other IEM’s during that time. Coming back, I found no dissatisfaction or loss of what I liked. That “newness” had not worn off, because it hadn’t started in the first place. With a mellower sound (as described above), the Rai Penta provided me with a very nice way to enjoy music without a formalness, which can pervade some higher end IEM’s. While the Empire Ears Legend X just reached out and wowed you, the Rai Penta provided that calm confidence. I think I would call it safe tuning. And while there certainly isn’t anything wrong with safe tuning, it does not present itself as being overly good in any category. What I mean is that while very competent in all aspects, it does not shine in any one area. That is what I mean by safe. Consider this the jack of all trades. Almost.\n\nBass is top quality, with sufficient reach, but not enough to make it rumble. It is present and very enjoyable, but not overwhelming like a Campfire audio tuning. And there isn’t anything wrong with that sort of tuning either. On the Tedeschi Trucks Band Midnight In Harlem, the bass presentation is sublime and subdued. Definitely playing the support role, it is exceptional. But it is meant to be on that song. I kept listening to this song over and over not only for Susan’s voice (oh…my…), but for that bass line and how it melds with her vocals and the upper. A very good mix on a mellow song. Two that are meant for each other.\n\nIn that regard as well, the mids are there, but as others have mentioned, fall behind. Not that this would be the weak link, but what I will call the safe tuning, subdued part. I am unable to pick out the intricate detail like I can with my CTM Da Vinci X. It is almost on par with my UM Mentor V2 though. Almost. Clean, but subtle in presentation. Female vocals are good and male vocals are as well, but both are a bit too laidback for me with this tuning. Here is where I think Meze could have taken more of a chance. With the laidback signature, settling the mids more forward would have made the Rai Penta SING. At least to me. And that would have given it a superb presentation. Please do not take this as criticism, just my take on how the Rai Penta would have fit my tastes better. Still good, but not enough for me.\n\nAnd thankfully, the treble is not over the top. I am ever so thankful for that. On Santana’s Los Invisibles, the vocals of Buika are on the higher range, and could become grating at higher volumes. But not with the Rai Penta. Especially run through the iFi Pro iDSD. That tube sound compliments the song well, and the Rai quite well. There is a bit of sparkle, but not like the Da Vinci. That can become too much for me on some songs, but the crystalline sound, which emanates as a result is a treasure. This is good. Very good, but I wish for a small bit more push up top. Of course, this could be my hearing as well. Take that as you may. Carlos sound grand on the Rai…\n\nFollowing Carlos, Mary Lane’s old blues voice is wonderful. While missing that bit of grit or depth in the mids, her voice sounds gruff and tough as it should. This is good stuff, just not enough of it. The Blues Give Me A Feeling give me a good feeling through the Rai Penta. Most blues songs have a somewhat narrower soundstage and here it is no different. Presented with a personable soundstage, it is not the widest or biggest, but it is a clean space. There is no background noise at all. A black background emanates from the Rai Penta. I appreciate the silence.\n\nI would rate the layering & detail to be on the better side than not. I can distinctly pick out differences and the detail while again laidback is good. Not the best clarity-wise, but quite good and on par with others at this price. I continue to like the overall signature of the Rai Penta. For a TOTL first IEM it is an excellent effort.\n\nComparisons:\n\nMeze Rai Penta ($1099) v Campfire Atlas ($1299):\n\nI love the bass presentation of the Atlas. It is still superb after these few years. The mids fall behind the Rai Penta in “distinctness,” though. I find them falling behind the sound of the Rai, and not as enjoyable either. But that bass…. on Tedeschi Trucks Midnight In Harlem you have a definite rumble, and it is much appreciated. I still enjoy the Atlas sound signature, but the Rai Penta has surpassed it in terms of quality. But, with no muss and no fuss (except the cable can tangle), the Atlas can be on, in one’s ear and listening in a matter of seconds. An excellent commuting pair, the Atlas still garners much appreciation from my ears.\n\nBut, the overall goes to the Rai Penta here, even with a bit narrower soundstage. Detail is better, treble presentation is tighter, and with less of a detached upper sound as well. To me the Atlas uppers have a sort of “go their own way” to them, which I think purposely draws a bit of attention away from the bass, lest you continually get blown away.\n\nMeze Rai Penta ($1099) v Clear Tune Monitors Da Vinci X ($2400):\n\nFrom the moment I heard the Da Vinci X on the tour, I knew it was in my future. I know consider it my top TOTL. My judge against the others. With a bit hotter treble than I like until I get reacclimated to the sound, the sparkle is marvelous. Bass is tight and just right. It does not have the rumble like the Atlas, but it isn’t meant to. No, it is all about quality. I heard some describe it as a bit too analytical. I disagree and call it precise. Like that surgeon who knows what the heck they are doing, and it shows. This is a phenomenal sound.\n\nSo why include it against the Rai Penta then? Well flagship against flagship, that’s why. All of the ones I have listed were considered flagships at one point (or still are) by the company and as such you gauge your best against theirs. The Rai is definitely more laidback, and mids are no match. But that mellow sound makes for a really enjoyable long-term session. With the Da Vinci X, I must turn the sound down after some time. I prefer longer listening terms, but sometimes I just cannot with the X. It might be that the X is TOO precise for me. Maybe that is it, or maybe I am just overly sensitive to what comes through. That said, Please Don’t Tell Her is a phenomenal listen. Just about perfection to me. The Rai is good. The X is superb.\n\nMeze Rai Penta ($1099) v Unique Melody Maestro V2 ($1599):\n\nEvery time I think of selling the Maestro V2 to fund another, I give it a listen and essentially think, “what the heck are you doing??!!” I still find joy in my official first TOTL IEM. I heard it one day and contacted Andrew at Musicteck to arrange a purchase the same day. I was sold. I still am. The bass is better than the CTM, with more (even if a bit more untamed). Vocals are sublime, and there is a definite push up top. I would not call it sparkle, but brilliance. Mids are not only cleaner, but clearer than the Rai Penta as well. Still on par with many of the TOTL I have heard, I marvel when I listen. It also has a bit wider soundstage as well. Then Crazy Mary comes on, and I just stop writing, and listen. Layered, distinct, placement, separation. It has the goods. I called the Maestro the cool kid who everyone likes because he is so cool. This still holds, but for mellowness, the Rai Penta has now surpassed the Maestro.\n\nI would call this the closest comparison to the Rai Penta in my arsenal. And it can most definitely hold court with the Rai. If the Rai Penta had the mids of the Maestro, it would be just about perfect to me. The bass of the Rai Penta is of better quality, but reach is a bit more surprisingly on the Maestro. I marvel at how lucky I am to be deciding between two flagships, one old and one new. It is an excellent conundrum to have and one, which the Rai Penta makes harder to judge. I do still prefer the Maestro overall, though. It just fits my bill better. Not a slam of the Rai Penta, just preference for the Maestro.\n\nMeze Rai Penta ($1099) v Unique Melody Mentor V3 ($2099):\n\nAnother tour purchase, the Mentor V3 came my way because I liked the signature more than the Mason V3. A bit better bass sound to me, and excellent detail retrieval, this is the closest to the Da Vinci X of what I have. More forward in upper mids, the Mentor provides me with the more mellow sound than the X. A nice compliment. Not quite as laidback as the Rai Penta, but another good representation. Again, not really a fair comparison, but one to possibly reach for when Meze goes full-Empyrean with their IEM. The Mentor also has a wider soundstage and better detail retrieval. Cleaner (which may seem antithesis to laidback), but that cleanliness comes through in the details. Not as precise as the X (not much is), but better than the Rai Penta, the Mentor just provides me with that very pleasant sound I relish.\n\nThe Rai Penta here is a bit subdued, as one would expect. It still does well against the Mentor, and one could state that Meze aimed for all of the top brands TOTL with the Rai Penta. And it nearly succeeded.\n\nSources:\n\nUsing the Shanling M5s, the combination was quite good. This is the combo, with which I could feel the mids were a bit light though. I enjoyed the combination due to the tight, taut bass and slightly warm presentation. I prefer the warm side of sound, and this was pretty good. Switching to the Questyle QP2R though, brought the whole level up. Opening the sound up to give more lift, the air between the notes using the 2.5bal cable was wonderful. Giving that silent blackness between notes a stage to me gave the pair validity. This was a sound in which I could happily live. Treble was better, with a nice opening up top to accommodate the music, gave a bit wider soundstage, but spread the notes better within that realm. More definition would be a good response.\n\nSwitching the thebit Opus #2 made even the QP2R sound a bit flat. To me this was the best of the pairings I played, even against the MBP/iFi Pro iDSD combo. I had almost forgotten how much I like the Opus, and this pairing brought the best of each out. The Rai Penta dovetailed nicely into the signature of the Opus. Better bass quantity than the QP2R, as in a bit deeper reach and more of it; the Rai Penta finally had a bit of rumble in some songs. Not much, but enough to appreciate it. I spent at least two full days listening to the pair this way and wish I had spent longer. For the $2k you would spend on this pair you would be hard pressed to find a better set in my humble opinion. Of course, there are options, but I found this pairing to present the sound just the way I like: good bass, solid vocals (from the Opus), with good treble without peakiness. I was quite happy.\n\nSpeaking of the MBP/iFi Pro iDSD combination, I find I use this the most when listening. Having Tidal Premium it is an easy judge of sound for many objects. I will also throw the XDuoo x10t ii on the iFi, and this is the subject of sound extraordinaire. Where the MBP relies upon the iFi to make it better, the XDuoo enhances what the iFi has, raising the level of both. The MBP is decently good through the iFi, the XDuoo is extraordinary. If I had to choose one home set up in that manner, it would be the XDuoo/iFi combination. I absolutely love this pairing. Clean clear, crisp and concise; I am reminded of a time when I could actually hear all that is good in the music. The MBP/iFi pairing is used as a tool to judge. The XDuoo/iFi is a tool to remember. I like both regularly, but for the critical decision making, the XDuoo wins. And it is good.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWell, my time is up. The Rai Penta leaves the midwestern state shortly and moves to points elsewhere. During its journey, I hope many enjoy the Meze as much as I have. To listen to a manufacturers first attempt at making the flagship, which starts a path towards their headphone TOTL, the Empyrean is no small feat. The bar was set extraordinarily high. Almost unattainable. And I will state that the Rai Penta does not do for IEM’s what the Empyrean did for headphones. It is not earth shattering, or paradigm redefining like the Empyrean was. I am disappointed in that, but upon deeper reflection, that is not the point. This may be more akin to when the 99Classic came about. At that price, it is still one of the few I truly recommend to friends who want to get into the market. An excellent starting point for movement upwards, or simply give the user a taste of what an audiophile headphone can sound like by spending a bit more than the “beats-generation,” I still like the 99’s, all iterations. And in that regard, when one compares what the 99’s did to what the Rai Penta may be setting the tone for in the future, it will be successful. It is good in that reign. It is wonderful for those who are searching for something in this price as an entry point into audiophile-dom. And here the Rai Penta largely succeeds. Build, which is second to none (as I would expect); a cable, which is soft, supple and does not tangle; fit, which is very good for those long sessions; and a sound, which is quite pleasant makes for success.\n\nI do like the mellow sound, but wish Meze had taken a bigger chance, like they did with the Empyrean. But as stated above, when one tempers that wishful thinking into solid logical reflection against what the 99 brought to the headphone market, the Rai Penta makes perfect sense. A sound, solid entry into the above-$1k market, and something in which we can anticipate a higher model should do for the IEM market what the Empyrean did for headphones. Anyhow from Tedeschi Trucks finishes my time, and it is fitting. Bringing out the goodness of signature, anytime, anyplace, anyhow. I look forward to the next iteration of what Antoine and company purvey our way, for it will be good.\n\nI thank Meze and Andy Kong. For inclusion on the North American tour. My two weeks have been fabulous, and I wish those that follow the same success. It was fun.\n\nPros: Excellent sound, comfort, and fit.\n\nCons: Price. I wish they were a bit more affordable.\n\nRAI PENTA BY MEZE AUDIO REVIEW\n\nmezeaudio.com\n\nTechnical Specs:\n\nDriver: PENTA-HYBRID DRIVER\n\n(4 x Customized Balanced Armature and 1 x Dynamic\n\nDriver working harmoniously together)\n\nFrequency Range: 4Hz – 45kHz\n\nImpedance: 20Ω\n\nSensitivity: 110dB SPL/1mW Sensitivity\n\nMax Input Power: 30mW\n\nDistortion: <1%\n\nStock cables: MMCX connector ending in 3.5mm, Rhodium-plated\n\nUpgrade cables: MMCX connector ending in\n\n2.5mm TRRS balanced and 4.4mm balanced as extra accessories\n\nWarranty period: 2 years\n\nThis month I’m reviewing a beautiful pair of Meze Rai Penta IEM’s. I received a pre-release pair as a review set and was able to put them through the paces for a month. Before going into the review I’d like to give a little background of Meze Audio.\n\nThey are a high-end audio manufacturer out of Romania. They have had enormous success with their beautiful “99 Classics” in hand-polished walnut and their “99 Neo” line. Their foray into the high-end came with the fantastic sounding and equally expensive planar magnetic Empyrean that sent a message…\n\nMeze is here, and they’re here to stay.\n\nAntonio Meze, a designer, founded the company in 2011 in Baia Mare, Romania. His concept is simple, beautiful sounding headphones made with cutting edge technology. He researched, learned, and experimented before coming up with the first of the stellar lineup, the 99 Classics. After they launched it seemed as if everyone on Head-fi.org either had a pair or wanted a pair. They have a huge following there and it’s well deserved.\n\nI first came in contact with Meze at the 2016 NYC CanJam. I was working the convention for a manufacturer and ran across a really nice guy named Mircea who shared some of the same tastes in music as myself and he invited me to his booth. “Meze Audio?” I asked him, “what’s that mean”. He then told me the story of Antonio Meze and the lineup. I sampled the Walnut 99 Classics and bought them on the spot. Fast forward a few years, and another couple of shows where we’ve run into each other and here we are today.\n\nThe Rai Penta is their top of the line in-ear monitors that were introduced in 2018. They are a 5 driver IEM that features four customized balanced armature drivers and one dynamic driver working flawlessly together to produce an amazing sound experience. These IEM’s feature what Meze calls Penta Hybrid Technology. According to their website, this technology allows them to deliver harmonized sound frequencies without the problems of phases overlaying each other. The sound goes from the drivers through chambers CNC’d into the aluminum and out through the ear nozzles instead of using some manner of plastic tubing. In recent times some testers have had an issue with the harmonics bleeding within the plastic tubing.\n\nBelow is an image of the Penta Hybrid Technology.\n\nSpeaking of the anodized shell, I have to mention that these monitors are absolutely beautiful. I test a lot of IEM’s and I have to say, without a doubt, that these are the most comfortable and beautifully simplistic IEM’s I have tested to date. The rounded shell is smooth with a curve that fits perfectly in my conch. The CNC aluminum shell is emblazoned with the Meze logo and they use standard MMCX cables. They feel great in the hand AND in the ear.\n\nAs you can see in the visual, the ergonomic shape is brilliantly designed to fit in just about anyone’s ear comfortably. The solid aluminum body is milled with air chambers designed to perfectly deliver sound directly into your inner ear. This is accomplished by their PES System (Pressure Equalization System).\n\nThe Rai Penta has a low impedance of 20Ω which allows them to sound beautiful with just about every portable source out on the market today without hissing or noise filling the black spaces in your music tracks. According to Meze, these drivers are meticulously tuned to provide a super high-resolution response with a frequency range of 4Hz to 45kHz. Visually and physically beautiful, these were a pleasure to get to test.\n\nThe MMCX cable they come with is a high-quality silver-plated copper cable consisting of four wires, each with 20 strands of pure silver Litz. The included cable is terminated in a 3.5mm plug and the connectors are very well made to provide a lifetime of listening pleasure. As an aside, Meze also offers a balanced 2.5mm and balanced 4.4mm cable as an option.\n\nFor this review, I am using an iBasso DX220 on high gain, a volume level of 40, and the equalizer off. My standard Test Music microSD card is loaded with high-resolution FLAC files of the genre’s I listen to the most, classic rock, classical, acoustic rock, EDM, and country. After the initial test, I put the IEM’s through their paces with a batch of DSD512 files.\n\nTo start, I have to say that the clarity and tone of these IEM’s are pretty amazing. When listening to the Allman Brothers Band, “Midnight Rider”, the soulful notes are carried forward behind the signature guitar lick beautifully. You can hear the background bongo’s and second acoustic guitar playing even after the electric guitar begins the first solo of the song. I’m thinking to myself, WOW, great start!\n\nMoving on through a few songs, I ended up on Carly Simon’s, “Nobody Does It Better”. The classic James Bond song from the movie with the same name. The blending of the full orchestral symphony with the drums and piano combined with her angelic voice took me to another place. Remembering the movie scene where Mr. Bond is chatting while looking at the Great Pyramid of Giza brought a huge smile to my face! The sound coming out of these little IEM’s is blowing me away, and I’m only 20 songs in! When the brass section in the song came in, my eyes popped open. It was like I was feeling the blast right in my face. Again, WOW.\n\nAfter that, I figured it’s time for “Stairway to Heaven”, the classic Led Zeppelin song. Jimmy Page’s guitar during the intro and the flutes were magical and when Robert Plant began singing, I was pulled into the studio with them. When listening to John Bonham’s drumming, it is difficult to resist finger tapping. During the big solo, it was as if Page’s monitor was right in front of my face. Again my eyes popped open with Plant’s, “And as we wind on down the road…” My god, his voice is ridiculous. It was like listening to the song for the first time in years. That’s the emotion that these IEM’s brought out. I often use this song to determine the quality of sound coming out of headphones and IEM’s. The separation of instruments along with the harmony can tell a lot about the tuning of whatever I’m using to listen to at the time. These are beautifully tuned and I have nothing but appreciation for the Meze engineers.\n\nWhat I began to notice are the tightness of sound and absolute clarity. The highs were brilliant without being shrill, the mids come out with distinction, and the bass gives a welcome beat with an extra oomph that was surprising and pleasant. These are exceptional sounding IEM’s and I was thoroughly enjoying them.\n\nAnother song of note was when I changed it up to some EDM. I played Don Diablo’s, “Never Change” and was so engrossed in the song that I didn’t notice my wife come home from work until she scared me by sticking her face into mine! These things are so clear and precise it’s as if I’m in the studio, with full-size cans on, playing with the mixing board!\n\nThese IEM’s are definitely one of the most versatile that I’ve had the pleasure of testing recently. Every music genre I throw at them, they play flawlessly. Every note, whether it’s coming from a Steinway piano, or electric guitar sounds incredibly tight, and fast. The bass is punchy, and to me sounds like there’s an extra bump in its delivery. Once I began to really formulate an opinion on these, I decided to go a little heavier with my music tastes. Read that as bring on the AC/DC and Metallica! I use these two bands for my heavier tastes because their songs are iconic and classic as well as heavy. The Rai Penta played both “Hell’s Bells” and “Enter Sandman” like a champ. Before moving on to some classical tracks I had to play, “For Those About To Rock” by AC/DC. It was absolutely the right thing to do, as before the first line was out, my eyes were closed and I was singing along, loudly. There was no blurring of instruments here whatsoever. Angus Young’s lead guitar was distinct against his brother Malcolm Young’s’ rhythm guitar and Brian Johnson’s iconic voice. Yeah, my wife was NOT happy about this song playing, at ALL.\n\nIn her words, “the neighbors can hear you, and your voice sucks.” LOL\n\nYeah, whatever…\n\nI decided to pull it in with some of my favorite classical music tracks. Beethoven’s, “Bagatelle in A Minor (Fur Elise)” sounded beautiful with every note resounding clear and precise. Bach’s, “Air on a G String” is one of my favorite pieces ever, and listening to it on the Rai Penta was amazing. The beautiful intro just brought me joy and again the separation of instruments was sublime. A few more songs flew by and the one I remember most fondly is Pachelbel, “Canon in D”. The song was evocative of the best of classical music all wrapped up in one precise dance of notes. Amazing.\n\nI ended my two weeks of listening pleasure with Queen’s, “Bohemian Rhapsody”. I always use this as my last track because of the complexity of the song. So far these IEM’s have performed beautifully and they did not disappoint with Queen. Freddy Mercury’s voice, piano, and harmonization with the other members’ voices were just stellar. There really isn’t anything else to say about how the song sounded. It just sounded fantastic, classic, haunting, and beautiful. Now I had two weeks to write it all up…\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s been a long couple of weeks that flew by listening to the Rai Penta’s. I smiled more than I have while listening to music in a long time. Often I had to stop tracks just to process how great they sounded. This is not normal for me, I usually approach testing headphones and monitors with one track after the other, a few times taking notes. This was different, very different. I became attached to these and started going off book. That is a rabbit hole for a reviewer and something I really refrain from doing. Going off your set playlist and just throwing random songs at something may seem innocent enough, but in reality, it makes your brain spin with either pleasure or changes your opinion of the item completely. Not so in this instance. I was happily going from genre to genre, from FLAC to DSD to Qobuz, enjoying the heck out of these.\n\nI place these in my highest category, Pretty Awesome. You get a fantastic bang for your buck with these IEM’s. To summarize, the tone, bass, clarity, precision are all hitting above their weight class. The fit is probably the best universal I have ever put inside my ears, and they were so comfortable that I fell asleep on my side while wearing them. I highly recommend these IEM’s.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nPros: Exceptional build quality and finish\n\n- Very comfortable\n\n- Natural tonality and timbre in the midrange\n\n- Source agnostic for the most part\n\n- Doesn't get fatiguing even after long listening sessions\n\nCons: Sub-par bass response\n\n- Treble extension leaves much to be desired\n\n- Sub-par micro-detail retrieval\n\n- Average soundstage\n\n- No immediate \"wow-factor\" in the tuning\n\n- Price\n\nIt’s hard being a flagship.\n\nJust being “pretty good” across the board won’t cut it. Outright supremacy is the aim here, and that’s the bar that Meze Audio has set for themselves with their flagship Rai Penta. It’s quite a jump considering that their previous highest-tier IEM was the Meze 12 Classics worth ~$80.\n\nMeze did take their sweet time with the whole building and tuning process of the Rai Penta, which added further to the expectations. Then again — better safe than sorry.\n\nSo, how close do the Rai Pentas get close to excellence? Read on.\n\nNote: the ratings given will be subjective to the price tier. Definitely the expectations from a $15 IEM won’t be the same as a $150 one, and that’s the approach taken while assigning scores. The Rai Penta was sent courtesy of the Review Tour and shall be sent back to Meze once the tour is over. I would like to thank Andy sincerely for organizing the whole thing.\n\nSources used: LG G7, Questyle QP1R, Yulong DAART Canary, VE Odyssey, Apple USB-C to 3.5mm dongle, iPhone SE\n\nBuild: Well, Meze hit the ball off the park right at the start. The Rai Pentas are meticulously built, and the feel in hand/while wearing is especially sublime. They are sculpted from a single block of aluminium, and are as smooth as pebbles. You don’t feel the joints at all, and boy do they feel dense! The mmcx connectors are rather robust and didn’t seem to lose their solidity even after multiple cable swaps.\n\nThe nozzle has three sound-bores: one for the dynamic driver, and the other two for the dual mid and h"
