        "text": "Re: Sage 50!\n\n\"is it not possible to change the sound associated with that beep to silent?\".\n\nIt is, but that's like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The windows exclamation beep is useful, the sage one, is not. An example, I want to examine a completed customers order in the quickest way possible, by double clicking on the order so I can see the prices they paid last time. I then get a \"ding\" to tell me the order is completed. Another example is I have put a customer on hold. I want to take him off hold, so I double click his name, and get \"ding\" \"The customer is on hold\".\n\nAnd don't get me started on the stupid decisions, like offering a search tool for sales orders, but not a search tool for quotes, which would be a million times more useful because I want to find the quotes to convert them into sales orders. Oh and the inconsistency, some search tools are case sensitive, some are not. It's almost like different teams coded different modules. Some modules have a useful search function, some don't and instead you have to scroll down many pages to find say the bank account, or nominal code you want.\n\nIt is the most frustrating software I've ever used.\n\nRe: The Sound of Silence\n\nI used to have a colleague who lived to annoy me with his constant barrage of noise. His painfully squeaky swivel chair, his loud and annoying Fran Drescher nasal drone telling the same joke over the phone at volume 11 to everyone on his contact list, the noise was endless. I would stay late and get more done in the two hours after he'd left than in the seven he was there.\n\nThen he started leaving his workstation beeping when he left work and locking the desktop. I thought about hacking the bios. I thought about cutting the MB speaker wires. Then I realized I was *over* thinking and just unplugged his computer, gave it a five-count and plugged it back in.\n\nHe did a lot of data entry and would leave a bunch of stuff on his screen to be done the next day. All gone now of course.\n\nTook him three days to learn.\n\nAs for his squeaky swivel chair, I went and found the only unused new chair in the place and swapped his for that. He yelled and screamed and took his original back. So I bought a small can of WD40 and carefully oiled the wheels and the center column when he was gone, cleaning the oil off so it wouldn't foul his clothes.\n\nThe first day after I did this he sat down and 720-ed, leaping up and glaring at the super-silent chair, then me (straight-faced c/w halo). He tried to grind the bearing and it just moved silently. He pushed back in it and went sailing across the room into a row of disused servers - because the castors worked like wheels now instead of like round carpet-skis. He was completely dumbfounded. He was conviced it wasn't his chair, but then, it obviously was.\n\nHe would try and get it squeaking at every opportunity, grinding the seat back and forth, and it would start making noises about every two weeks, whereupon it got a nice new dose of WD40.\n\nOne day he came in, glared at me, sat down and gave the chair a particularly savage grinding with his arse. The center post snapped and he crashed to the floor like a felled oak. I admit I had to turn away and bite my hand to avoid being found out.\n\nAll this from a man who berated another colleague saying that the sound of a boiling (non-whistle) kettle ten feet away was \"distracting him from his work\". He said the colleague would have to stand by the kettle while it boiled to minimize the annoyance.\n\nIf you want to know what Yodel Shriekenhowl looked like, see if you can get a look at the 30 year anniversary DVD movie of Jean-Michel Jarre re-recording Oxygene. The bloke playing the keyboards on the extreme left as you watch is his identical twin brother, except he's quieter. I showed some people at work the movie and they couldn't tell it wasn't Foghorn Leghorn.\n\nRe: Bah!\n\nWell, Nine of Charles, I can tell you what would have happened in the unlikely event that someone tried to assert a non-existent right - I would have gone to the management and demanded his removal from the theater. Chances are they would have refunded me and offered me tickets for another showing.\n\nBut we both know that whole course of events wasn't going to happen outside the confines of your rather troubled brain.\n\nThis isn't the first time in these pages that you've concocted elaborate, violent, imaginary threats evolving out of someone else's anecdote. Ignoring the rather obvious passive-aggressive unannounced \"I disbelieve you\" subtext to these childish scenarios, the behaviour pattern seems to suggest a more deep-seated problem.\n\nMaybe you should rejoin the Borg collective and gain some collective stability. Perhaps you should just take your meds.\n\n\"Face a murder charge over a ringtone\". Azathoth on a galaxy-sized bike."
