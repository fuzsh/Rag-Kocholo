Obviously we are a fanzine, and obviously you are fans of bands that we cover (thus you holding us in your hands right now). In an effort to connect you with those that you love, we have decided to start a new section in the magazine where you can write in questions for members of the scene (band members / record label people / industry figures / pimps / etc.) that they could possibly answer for you. It will also be a general question area, that we can try to direct to the right people (ie: How do I get my band on the Warped Tour would be sent over to someone like Kevin Lyman). Just to save us both some time, questions like, “Hey, Davey Havoc, what’s your phone number and what are you doing on Friday night?” will probably not be responded to. So, let the flood gates of the “Does Tom Gable have a girl- friend?” questions flow: connections@ampmagazine.com We have also started a column for the almighty Kurt Ballou (guitar god from the almighty CONVERGE) about guitar tech questions.

WORD ON THE STREET Adolescents Join Finger Records Finger Records announced the signing of legendary Orange County punk rock act The Adolescents. The long running band celebrated their 25th anniversary and to commemorate the event they released their first new full length since 1988. The July I2th release, titled O.C. Confidential follows the Balboa Fun Zone released more than fifteen years ago. Since their last full length in 1988, the band has issued a number of releases and live recordings including Live at the House of Blues and The Complete Demos (1980-1986). Hot Snakes (2000-2005) Swami Records’ Hot Snakes have decided to part ways. The punk rock act had released a series of records on band member John Reis’ Swami Records, including Automatic Midnight, Suicide Invoice, Audit in Progress and most recently. Peel Sessions. In a hand-scrawled message, Reis had this to say; “So the rather sad news to report is that Hot Snakes will be packing it in after our current plans. It was a complete thrill to be part of and satisfied my insatiable hunger for sinister throbbing action. Thank you to ail that urged us along and leant an ear for us to abuse.” As explained in the message, the band will complete the remainder of their tour which includes some Australia dates and has also planned two farewell shows in Los Angeles and San Diego with The Husbands and The Heartaches. Promise Ring to reunite, Jimmy Eat World, Isis, others to perform at Flower 15 The lineup has been announced for the upcoming Flower Booking six-night fundraiser, Flowerl5. The six day event will take place November 8th through the 13th at the Metro in Chicago, IL. The show is intended to commemorate the 15th year of the long-running booking agency and will feature appearances by Local H, Isis, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, Jimmy Eat World, and a reunion by Milwaukee’s The Promise Ring with many more artists and band reunions expected to be announced over the next few weeks. The festival aims to raise $50,000 or more for P. LAY. ^(Possibilities in life; Art for Youth) a youth charity that aims to provide a constructive and creative outlet for young victims of abuse. Corgart announces plans to resurrect Smashing Pumpkins In a full page ad placed in today's edition of the Chicago Tribune, Billy Corgan has announced plans to resurrect the popular and influential 90s “alternative rock” act Smashing Pumpkins. While the former band mates have gone on to A Perfect Circle and solo projects, Corgan's statement does not make it entirely clear if he intends to reunite with the three surviving members of the band or to perform under the name. Drive-Thru to release double disc Bob Dylan tribute Drive Thru has set an August 16th release date for an upcoming double disc tribute to Bob Dylan. The set will include 21 Bob Dylan songs covered by a variety of artists including Something Corporate, Rx Bandits, As Tali As Lions and many others. Spearheaded by Drive Thru co-founder Stefanie Reines who provided a list of forty songs for the bands to choose, Reines had this to say; This project is all about love. I really want kids to experience what I do when I listen to a Dylan record. He’s an acquired taste, but once you get it there’s nothing in the world that is better or that you’d rather have. Dead Boys, Gorilla Biscuits, Against €BG&! Me!, Thursday, more to perform at CBGB’s this August SaveCBGB.org has announced a series of shows in honor of the legendary CBGB's nightclub. Among the band scheduled to play this August are 70s punk legends the Dead Boys, and performances by Gorilla Biscuits, and Circle Jerks as well as newer acts like Against Me! and Thursday. The goal of the performances is to help generate support and momentum hopefully leading to a renewed lease. The legendary NYC club which played home to bands like the Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie, Television and literally hundreds of others artists through the years may be forced to close its doors. The situation arose due to a dispute with Bowery Residents Committee which holds a 45-year lease on the building. CBGB’s is their lone commercial tenant; their rent feud dates back five years, when the committee went to court to collect more than $300,000 in back rent from the club. The Bowery Residents Committee which is 75% funded by the city of New York has listed the property on the Real Estate MLS for anyone else who wishes to rent 313 and 315 Bowery. New signings and new management at Martyr Records Jay Reason of Stillborn Records and The Distance has taken over management of hardcore label, Martyr. The label recently produced releases from Modem Life is War and a split featuring With Honor /the Distance. As first order of business, Reason has announced the signing of two bands.

Some material from the band is available here. In related news, Palehorse who signed to the label in February have set a August 23rd release date for their upcoming full length. The Militia Group signs Israel’s Man Alive The Militia Group has signed Israeli punk act, Man Alive. The band recently appeared in the film Jericho's Echo and will release their debut, Open Surgery on September 6th. The band is described as “catchy and energetic music is inspired by bands like Face to Face. Dischord says Nike stole Minor Threat artwork According to this story, multi-billion dollar shoemaker, Nike has stolen the legendary artwork of hardcore pioneers, Minor Threat. Destined for a campaign called Major Threat, the style and iconic imagery was used for the advertising and done so without the permission of Washington, D.C. based indie Dischord. The label owns the copyright on both the recording and artwork. The label had this to say with regards to permission: “Many people have now noticed that Nike has appropriated the Minor Threat artwork and logo for a new skateboard demo / ad campaign. To set the record straight - Nike never contacted Dischord to obtain permission to use this imagery, nor was any permission granted. Simply put, Nike stole it and we’re not happy about it. We are not yet sure what options, if any, we have to stop Nike from using our images to sell their shoes, but if you would like to direct your complaints to Nike that would be a good place to start. To longtime fans and supporters of Minor Threat and Dischord this must seem like just another familiar example of mainstream corporations attempting to assimilate underground culture to turn a buck. However it is more disheartening tc us to think that Nike may be successful in using this imagery to fool kids, just beginning to becoming familiar with skate culture, underground music and DIY ideals, into thinking that the general ethos of this label, and Minor Threat in particular, can somehow be linked to Nike’s mission. In any regard, we would like to thank the many people who have written to us in the last several days to express their outrage, support and encouragement.” We asked attorney and pastepunk.com editor Jordan Baker if he could give us some of his insight into the situation. Jordan had this to say: '‘Among the intellectual property rights that are at issue I think it’s very clear that Nike has made a derivative work out of Minor Threat's copyright in its cover art. Nike might argue that this is a parody, but I fail to see what kind of social commentary Nike is trying to make in its graphic in relation to the original Minor Threat art, and generally parody is no defense for this kind of commercial appropriation.” (Keep in mind that this is not legal advice and that you should consult a lawyer if you want professional assurance that the information, and your interpretation of it, is appropriate to your particular situation.) Nike eventually responded to a request for comment by Fanknews.org. The company issued this statement: “Nike Skateboarding sincerely apologizes for the creation of a tour poster inspired by Minor Threat s album cover. Despite rumors being circulated, Wieden & Kennedy and Odopod had nothing to do with the creation of this tour poster and should not be held accountable. To set the record straight, Nike Skateboarding’s “Major Threat” Tour poster was designed, executed and promoted by skateboarders, for skateboarders. All of the Nike employees responsible for the creation of the tour flyer are fans of both Minor Threat and Dischord records and have nothing but respect for both.” Minor Threats music and iconographic album cover have been an inspiration to countless skateboarders since the album came out in 1984, And for the members of the Nike Skateboarding staff, this is no different. Because of the album's strong imagery and because our East Coast tour ends in Washington DC, we felt that it was a perfect fit. This was a poor judgment call and should not have been executed without consulting Minor Threat and Dischord Records. We apologize for any problems this may have caused, and want to make very clear that we have no relationship with the members of Minor Threat, Dischord Records and they have not endorsed our products. Every effort has been made to remove and dispose of all flyers (both print and digital). Again, Nike Skateboarding sincerely apologizes to Minor Threat and Dischord Records. - Sincerely, Nike Skateboarding” Fat’s upcoming releases: Propaganda, Screeching Weasel collection and mere Fat Wreck Chords receipt posted an update on their release schedule. Of pa$Bcular note is a title and release date for the long awaited new Propaganda full length. From their wibsite: On August 23rd we have The Real McKenzies 10,000 Shots and Rise Against’s The Unraveling re-mixed and with bonus tracks. Up next there’s Against Me! with their second Fat full length. Searching For A Former Clarity, which comes out September 6th. In October we're looking forward to a Screeching Weasel collection, a compilation to benefit Protectorg, a full length from Western Addiction, and get this, a new Propaganda record entitled Potemkin City Limits. You heard it here first! We’re told that the album is m. 8 AMP being mixed in Chris Hannah's very own bedroom, and past experience tells us that anything going on in that bedroom usually takes about 3 or 4 minutes, so we'll be WAY ahead of schedule. That is great news! Then finally in November we close out the year with a new full length from Lagwagon. Wow. Now what the fuck was all that about a crystal bail. Matt Freeman health update Hellcat / Epitaph has posted an update on the current health of Rancid bassist Matt Freeman. The label commented that “Your concern is deeply appreciated and here is the official word on the status of Matt at present”: Matt Freeman recently underwent a successful surgery and his doctors have determined that his condition is not terminal. Matt is now home and recovering well. Matt and Rancid would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, love and prayers. Rumors of health problems arose when Freeman's condition prevented him from joining the Transplants on this summer's Warped Tour. Gang of Four details on re-recorded material As a follow up to earlier reports, Gang of Four has announced the track listing and release date of their upcoming compilation of re-recorded tracks. The band recently reissued their 1979 debut, Entertainment! which also included the Yellow EP and four previously unreleased recordings. “The reunited post-punk quartet signed to V2 back in April and the label will be issuing Whitey's Gift on September 20th.

The band features vocalist/guitarist Jamie Woolford of defunct act The Stereo and Animal Chin, as well as his Stereo bandmate Chris Serafini and drummer Scott Hessel. Wollford had originally posted some solo material which eventually went on to form material for the new band and a number of the resulting full band tracks have been posted on their myspace and purevolume sites and are aiming for a October 3rd release of their self-titled Militia debut, The Stereo released Rewind + Record in 2002 before calling it a day.

Vocalist/guitarist DJ Values posted the following on their myspace page: “So yes the rumors are true, after 4 years and over 300 shows in 17 countries, Let It Burn will be calling it quits. We are just as upset as you are, but the time was right. It was a decision that we all came to while on tour this month and we feel it is the right one to make. I could go on for hours about all the great experiences we have had and all the amazing, and sometimes not-so amazing people we have met over the years, especially Pete and l. This has been the most marvelous time of my life and a time I will and never forget, for that I thank each and every person who supported us or showed us love in anyway.” The band most recently released The Expanding Universe and before that a split with The Break and Hello Good Friend on Alone.

A statement from the ministry noted Smith’s appreciation for 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud and praised her as “one of the most influential artists in women’s rock ‘n’ roll.” Smith, who was presented with the award at an AIDS benefit concert in Paris, commented to the Associated Press “I have vowed to live up to this honor in my work and my conduct. I can't explain what I feel like.

(B Interview By Tristan Staddon /Live Photography By Dan Boczarski (www.danboczarski.com) T o tell you the truth, something about Fall Out Boy never used worked for me. I was, admittedly, a bit of a latecomer to their coming out party, but even once I became well acquainted with their particularly precipitous brand of pop-punk, I still couldn’t care much what all the fuss was about. Then when that fuss started foaming from my every friend’s mouth [not just kids here either; I’m talking full-fledged adults], it all became a little too much. Sure, all the references were pretty cheeky, the hooks strong enough to snare a beluga and apparently their live show was completely off the apeshit. But it still didn't really resonate with me. So let Fall Out Boy have their soaring choruses, magazine covers and children’s novels, 1 decided. I’d be just fine spending my afternoons eating pop- tarts with my hands and settling down for the night by brushing the crumbs out of my chest hair. Things were going to be alright. Then 1 heard From Under The Cork Tree and, you guessed it, those were my hindquarters flying positively clear over my, uh, teakettle. Whip-smart and conscious of its genre’s shortcomings, Fall Out Boy’s latest is as catchy as cholera on a cold Chicago morning. And unlike, say, Sammy Sosa, you can bet these boys didn’t use any corked bats making their hits. Oh, and as it happens Pete Wentz is a pretty nice guy, too. Considering he’s currently a bassist/lyricist/author who runs a clothing company [Clandestine Industries] and a new record imprint [Decaydance], and was stilt getting over some nasty flu symptoms at the time of our little talk, he had more than a few better things to be doing than chatting with me about why 1 can’t stop listening to the record he just made. Here’s what we talked about: don’t know them yet, so it's still a lot of the older stuff. But that’s alright and kids have been really responsive so far. 1 think we’re doing probably about the best we’ve ever done right now. These are places we used to play and ifd only be full to partial capacity, but now these rooms are totally full, so that’s been really cool. It’s been good too, because a lot of the kids coming out and saying hi to us are saying that this is their second or third time seeing us, and that’s what we want to do. it’s cool to have new people coming out, but what we really want to do is let the kids who have been into us from the start grow up with us. I’ve read you say that before, that it’s important to you guys that your current fan base grows along with you rather than simply trying to appeal constantly to newer, younger people. You guys have obviously grown up really quickly as a band and, while that’s been going on, pretty quickly as human beings, too. How did that affect this record? It affects everything really, but I can’t sit here and say it’s just that. This record, just like all of us, has really been affected by the world we live in. I’ve realized over the past couple of years that the world’s an ugly place right now. If you’re not at least a little bit depressed about the world right now, then you’re probably not paying attention to what’s going on around you. We’ve got a guy running the country who shouldn’t ever be in charge of anything, we just had the tsunami happen and everything... and there’s so much more that I’ve seen - that we've all You guys are back in your home state right now on the Fueled By Ramen & Friends Tour. For a lot of people, the songs you’ll be debuting on this tour will be the first time they’ve heard them. How are audiences responding to it so far? It’s going welt so far. We’re only playing a couple of new songs«every night because, like you say, a lot of people : seen - that’s really fucking depressing. So I almost feet like this record is bigger than us, because so much of it has to do with the state of the world we’re living in. It isn’t a political record, but it is influenced by politics and political decisions - because we are. it’s also just about the things we do to each other and let happen while we watch. You know, weVe been all over the world over the fast couple of years and you see a lot of shit when you do that. kind of world you're in now compared to the one you were in four years ago? Day-to-day, it’s not that different. We still sleep until noon - well, sometimes anyway - get up and play a show almost every day. You only really notice the difference when you step back pretty crazy world you guys have been thrust into, Day-to-day, how different is it to navigate the and realize how fast this whole thing is moving. Sometimes along the road it has honestly felt like a runaway train, going along at some ridiculous mites- per-hour without a driver. It really feels like one false move and it could all fall apart anytime. WeVe just held on and trusted that everything would work out alright in the end and so far it’s doing that. Deep down, I still feel like the same person I was four years ago - I feel like I can still see the same person inside of myself that I was - and I’m just going to keep on being myself. Writing this record was tough on me, though. It really took a lot out of me - it felt like it almost killed me. I don’t think any of the other guys had any Idea ~ well, maybe Patrick [Stump, vocalist/guitarist] knew a little - but it was really rough on me at times, Do you think that over the past couple of years, as your profile’s been raised, and there’s been less accountability from people spreading Information about you, it’s become easier for people who don’t know you to have misperceptions about you or the band? Well, yeah it has. A lot of our success - especially our early success - came from websites and downloading sites like PureVolume and MySpace. So, I guess you live by the Internet, you die by the Internet. It’s sort of a weird thing, because we are an Internet band. Not that long ago, that would've been unheard of for a band to make the kinds of jumps we’ve made just from touring and the Internet. So, I guess along with that, you’ve got to ready yourself for the other side of what the Internet can do. We weren't ready for it at all at first, but now that we’ve had more than our share of stuff made up about us and said or whatever, I guess we’re sort of used to it. But it can get pretty unnerving sometimes for sure. get Justin Pierre from Motion City Soundtrack* Did that one work out? No, it didn’t. It was just a matter of scheduling and we had a conflict where they were recording for their new album and it just wouldn’t have gotten done in time. That was too bad, because it would've been really cool - those guys are good friends of ours. We did, though, get William Beckett, our friend from The Academy Is... and then another guy, Brendan Urie from this new band called Panic! At The Disco. Have you heard of them? me - they’re really all I have, and I want them to be perfect. Ultimately though, I have to realize that’s not ever going to be possible, so you just realize that an album’s a snapshot of where you are at one moment. The way Patrick and I work I don’t think I can explain logically to anyone, i don’t know what it is, or how it happens - and if someone told me that, I wouldn’t believe them ** but it works for us. There’s some, like, magic or something between us that I’ve never had with anyone else. It’s impossible for me to describe, but it’s pretty incredible. Looking at From Under The Cork Tree, Pete, one of most noticeable differences is the change behind the boards • you guys decided to work with [producer] Neal Avron (A New Found Glory, Everclear) out In L.A. That must’ve been quite an experience. C’mon and relive the whole thing for me. Neil was really good. He brought a lot of experience to the table - certainly more than we had ever worked with before. And as far as helping us through this whole \"major label debut” thing and the pressures of working under expectations, he was a great help. But L.A. is a scary place, man. I felt like an alien being out there. The weather’s funny ~ nice, but weird - and everybody’s so blonde. And then set against that there’s all of this ugliness. It was just such a weird place and it really didn’t help the kind of stuff that I was going through when I was writing, it was seriously pretty rough. But I got through it and Patrick and \\ worked hard to put this whole thing together. If s just so hard when the words mean so much to Yeah, one of our mutual friends, Scott Nagelberg from Crush, Introduced me to them not too long ago. Yeah, so Brendan’s on there, too. He's a sweet guy, so that was a lot of fun. Those guys are going to be really good, I know you had hoped to have a couple of guests appear on this record and you did get [A New Found Glory’s] Chad Gilbert. Tell me wbat he did when you had the tapes flown over to him. We sent the tapes off and told him, you know, that we wanted him to lay down some heavier-style screams for the song \"I Slept With Someone In Fall Out Boy and Ail I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me.” Basically, we sent him the tapes and he did it in like one take, or one day at least, and sent them right back. That was pretty awesome. Something I found most interesting about this album is that, even recently, you were saying that “Hand Of God” was one of your favorite songs to play live. Now I’ve read that you’re not even deeming it good enough to be on the record? Well, you’re right - it isn’t on the record. But it wasn’t really that we didn’t think it wasn’t good enough. It still is one of my I’ve also read you had hoped to 14 AMP things go - ifs like some episode of the Twilight Zone. Everybody just wants the same thing all the time so that it’s easy and nobody has to think. Everybody’s always interested in the great song titles. Among the notables I’ve heard rumored this time: well, we just confirmed “I Slept With Someone tn Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me.” [Laughs]. Yep, that's definitely going to be on there. “Sophomore Slump Or Comeback Of The Year.” Yeah, it's there for sure. “Snitches and Talkers Get Snitches and Walkers.” No, actually it didn’t make the cut. But we took that song and it sort of became another song called “A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More Touch Me?” Obviously Molly Ringwald gets a lot of attention for being such a big star in the 80 s, but it’s pretty funny to make a silly reference to Samantha Fox and that kind of porn-sex stuff. And we’ve also got \"Nobody Puts Baby In The Corner” from the DVD/E P on here, too, and that's a reference to Dirty Dancing and Patrick Swayze. I like doing that kind of stuff with the names, you know what i mean? They’re just these little things about our generation that I like to attach on that give it that little extra meaning. favorites to play. But because, again, of the world we live in, it wasn’t o.k. to have a song with the word ‘God* in it, and we didn’t want to change it, so we just left it off. change the name of it So, we just did it like that. I think it’s pretty ridiculous, with everybody taking the names so seriously ~ especially with “Hand Of God? I think it’s a great name and it’s not anti-Bush or anything. Its just the right name for the song and we ail like it, so it’s just too bad. So if you left that one off over the naming issue, to what can we attribute “Our Lawyer Made Us Change The Name Of This Song So We Wouldn’t Get Sued?” [Laughs], Well, originally we were going to call that song “My Name Is David Ruffin and These Are the Temptations,” but, well, you know the story behind that, right? It’s too bad that that even has to be a factor. Yeah, it is. It just goes to show that there are still a lot of stupid people in the world. I just think it's funny. It’s like the ultimate business decision move, too, because if you put the word ‘God’ in the name of something then you’ll get labelled as a Christian band, or it might be interpreted as against Christians in some way. Ifs just bizarre the way these And if there’s one thing America needs right now, it might be more Patrick Swayze. Exactly, yeah! K Yeah! Yeah, so I guess David Ruffin heard about it and we were going to have to AMP 15 AVAILABLE NOW 30 YEARS WAR UNDER THE GUN CDEP Polit^aHy-charged Santa Qru? screamy hard cate.

Recently signing powerhouse Nitro Records, a label in the midst of redefining itself with a slew of great signings (NT, THE LETTERS ORGANIZE; BULLET TRAIN TO VEGAS), these young lads play powerful, fast, and ' hard punk rock, in the vein of STRIKE ANYWHERE, KID DYNAMITE, and fellow label mates A WILHELM SCREAM. Coupling with their explosive music is their thoughtful, passionate, and sometimes overtly political lyrics, proving once again that young bands in this scene are in tune with the world around them.

Do you guys have any plans for the road this year, to get your name out there before the new release comes? Right now we are focusing on writing and playing out regionally up until we record, but after it doesn't look like we’il be stopping until we have to write our next CD. Bight now is a time where so many cookie-cutter bands are being thrust upon the scene, yet NO TRIGGER comes off as being a band that Is sincere about their art and their music. What are your feelings on the state of the punk rock scene today? You bring up a good point Matt, and even though Pm sure what I have to say about this party we call the punk scene won’t be taken as gospel to many, I’m glad you asked. Personally, I almost want to believe that this cookie-cutter revolution of bands you speak of, and we all kind of know of whom you speak, has come and gone. It's in the past. Finito. I believe that right now labels, are j NOT signing those kinds of bands as much and the . U dawning of a new era of awesome bands is upon B us.

Yet. So how would you describe your sound? WHAT! No Trigger is unfamiliar?! Maybe you are right, AMP. I mean we haven't shaken hands with any presidents or anything, but surely our time will come. So chances are that if you are reading this you probably haven’t heard us, so I’m here to help you out. We are a Massachusetts-based melodic punk / hardcore band with progressive lyrical stylings and some serious panache. If this is what you fancy, then you should check it out. Hard. How did you guys get together? a Hmmm. This is always a pretty boring story in our case, but basically two close-knit bands nearing their respective ends disbanded and formed one band with better goals and a new direction. We all fit together well and we went Aft with It. And here we are. t|| You recently signed on with Nitro jdfl Records, home to an up-and-coming crop of talented punk rock bands like LETTERS ORGANIZE and A WILHELM SCREAM, and the one-time home of the legendary AFI. How did you manage to catch their ear? Weil, we were getting a bunch of offers from many different indie labels for a while and we- were either careful or lazy and didn’t jump at any of them. At the same time we have been good friends with A Wilhelm Scream for a while, and they casually whispered good things about us into the ears of Nitro at one point or another. We got some calls, made some plans, Nitro flew out see us, bought us dinner, we some ' Bthinking, Hand we Bp . JMotned on month later. How has the experience with Nitro been to this point? Phenomenal. They have the resources and the experience and it really shows. Nothing but good things about them so far. Send them your demo. kids. So when should we expect to see your first Nitro release, and do you have any of the details worked out about recording yet, such as when, where, or who you’ll be working with? Yes, sir. Our full-length on Nitro will come out early in 2006. Our record will be produced and engineered by the mighty Bill Stevenson at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, CO. We will be going into record the album in September. And yes, we are pretty friggin’ pumped. So your first EP was released last year, titled Extinction in Stereo, on Bigmouth Japan.

CRIME IN STEREO. ENEMY YOU, and NO TRIGGER. As far as 1 see if things are really looking up at the moment in this underground mix of styles and sounds, but no matter what happens, at least some of the smaller bands who deserve a shot are getting their shot, because that was a lot harder to do in the past. What influences your band, both in terms of the music you write, and the lyrics you write? Musically, our influences come from all over, mostly because we write songs as a group, and since each one of us is into slightly different stuff, we have different collective musical influences. When we write songs, we all get ^ together and bring up wtk ideas and then someone mk expands on them and BL then someone else ' ; '.Bf expandS'On those, Bfetso at the end we all Behave some input on WfWaH the songs... and I’m sure that’s how many bands might do it as well. As far as lyrics ^B go though, Wmm I write over JM' } BP 90% of the B Bl lyrics, and B||§gp lib.::-: what band, and what do you expect from the band’s future? The goals are simple. Use this mainly influences me are issues that I feel strongly about that I don’t see getting discussed enough in this type of music. For instance on our last record I wrote about the parallels between the fight for same sex marriage and the civil rights movement. My girlfriend’s mother is a lesbian, and she and her partner are two of the kindest and most genuine and most loving people I’ve ever met. Yet they cannot get married because they live in Rhode island, which is one of the 49 states that does not allow same-sex marriages. Why? Because some people get uncomfortable with’ the very thought of it? Because the bibie says it’s wrong 9 Because it doesn’t conform with the normal view of “family\"? Those are all pretty bogus reasons. Simply put, there is absolutely NO REASON why they should not be able to get married and get the same legally recognized union and benefits as other marriages. There is . no room for any sort lik of opinion on the Y _. - Hk issue either, just as there should IfBBjp have been no room for opinion on whether black people had rights ,. 8fa jj| equal to those TOv.T mk of whites. Its right and Wk wrong , _ and 49 states right now are wrong I mean I suppose I am proud where same-sex marriages can occur, but at the same time it’s pretty pitiful that the rest of the country is still at this level of ignorance and incongruence. So you guys have managed to emerge from the local scene of central Massachusetts and get signed to a highly respected and publicized independent, which wilt undoubtedly bring with it many other great opportunities. What kind of goals have you guys JBHBB BBMBWIk music and our message to the world in the best way possible, and to have a shitload of fun white doing if. Assuming that as soon as everyone reads this they’re gonna want a piece of NO TRIGGER, where can someone go to get more information on you guys? I suppose the best place to find out more about is our website, www.notrigger.org, because from there you can listen to our music and see our ugly mugs and so on. But you can also check out www.nitrorecords.com, and I’d even suggest checking out our drummer Mike's drum company at www. sjcdrums.com. Your favorite bands play that shit, and you ^should, too!

The Massachusetts-based band, who sold nearly 25O,O0Ocopies of their latest CD, “The War Within”, in the United States, have fulfilled their commitment to Century Media Records and are expected to sign a big-money major-label deal (possibly with Atlantic) for the North American territory. SHADOWS FALL had previously indicated that they were very happy with Century Media and had no intentions of signing with a bigger label. In an interview with Metal-Rules, com conducted last year, SHADOWSFALL singer Brian Fair said of Century Media, “They have seriously stepped it up in such a way that alt you can ask from a label is that as you grow as a band is that they step up and push you further and further. I’ve been amazed at the job they’ve done for us in the last couple years. It’s been amazing to feel that support. It makes you work harder, you know what I mean? It’s just awesome. Especially being on a small label like that compared with some of the bands that we’ve seen step up to the major labels, I think we have just as much going for us as they do. Only we still have all the control (laughs).” SHADOWS FALL have been confirmed as one of the main-stage performers at this year’s Ozzfest. > OBITUARY front man John Tardy has posted the following message on the group’s official web site: “We got home late on Sunday from the five festivals we played in the last 10 days.

I don’t want to hype it up by telling . everyone how great it is. I’d rather wait until some clips are released through the Internet or CD samplers, and let the music speak for itself. I can say that band is vefy satisfied with the work we’ve dope, and feel like another plateau has been * reached as musicians. Lyrically, the album is very deep and dark. In fact, ‘Constitution’ \"has become ' a full-on concept album with a story included about a post-apocalyptic society. This story and its themes intertwines heavily with the artwork handled wonderfully again by Travis Smith, who did the design work for ‘Gone Forever’ and the ‘Better Days’ EP. With the exception of some weekend tour dates in July, GOD FORBID will be takirig the rest of the summer off, for our first real break in a year and a half. Our next U.S. tour should be expected near the album’s release date, September 20th, and a European tour should follow. We’ve also taken some steps in the next frontier. That’s right playing some shows on M-A- R-S. Mars Bitches. See y’all at the beach. Peace. “ > Australia’s Day Of Contempt recently secured a deal with Epitaph Records. The group has previously released material with Good Life Recordings. Their new EP, “The Will To Live,” was produced by Josh Abraham (Weezer) and will hit stores on August 9th. > A note to “Death From Below’’ readers: ShaUn Luu, a notable individual within the Syracuse music scene, has lost his battle with brairi cancer, an illness, he’s been suffering from for nearly three years. One week before his 23rd birthday, Luu died in his sleep June 9th, with his family by his side. A benefit show will likely take place soon. Luu was the lead vocalist of Glaciers (originally known as Word As A Virus). May he rest in peace. “Annihilation.” Though your long time partner in crime Bob Moore was aboard, Neil was definitely at the helm. Why did you choose to utilize his talents, what did he bring to the table and why not Bob full on or possibly someone else like Punchy! We wanited to do the absolute best job we could, and we felt that Neil had the experience and perspective of what we were trying to achieve and help us get it. The last time we talked, you told me about how you felt that records should not only he fun to listen to, hut fun to make. Was “Annihilation” an enjoyable studio experience? For us it was, but it really wasn’t for Jon. (laughs) We had a lot of fun, doing stuff with George was a blast. We slaved away on it, but it was a good slave, really dig in and do it. Speaking of Jon, if you wouldn’t mind helping lay all rumors to rest, why is he not in the band anymore? I know you issued a formal statement, but there still seems to be a lot of gossip. Jon wanted to stick with his day job and he couldn’t continue touring and keep his day-job. The fact is, the long time benefits of his job far outweighed anything he could have hoped to recoup in Nile. Orion Landau who did the layout for your solo record, also created the one for “Annihilation.” Did you guys collaborate, or was it more like letting Orion loose on the project? We turned him loose. He called me a couple times to ask some questions, but mostly we let him run with it. I f and when Morbid Angel retire, I have no doubt that Nile will take the death metal throne. Over the last decade, Nile have been invigorating and educating fans worldwide with their Egypt focused, death metal driven battleaxe of a band, and continually creating some of the most intelligent, brutal, brilliant records in and outside of the genre. The always funny, interesting and distinguished gentleman of death metal, Mr. Karl Sanders, talked me with via phone about their incredible new full length, ‘Annihilation of The Wicked/’ member changes, producer shifts, Egyptological figureheads, methods of torture, defining “epic” songs, memories of growing up arqnnd Morbid Angel, and...: the pitbull. It is once again my extreme honor to introduce Karl Sanders... How are you doing today Karl? I’m doing alright. You got some questions in store, for me? (laughs) Just a few. (laughs) So I heard you got pretty sick a hit ago. Everything alright now? Yeah, unfortunately when we on tour in Phoenix, 1 got food poisoning from Domino’s. It was pretty horrible. 1 just had to sweat it out and miss a show in New Mexico. Well, I guess it would be safe to say that Nile isn’t going to endorsing the Noid anytime soon... (laughs) (laughs) Probably not. You just released your latest masterpiece, “Annihilation of the Wicked.” How do you feel it compares to previous outings? I don’t think it compares at all. (laughs) We’ve never really made a record like this. It’s definitely not like “Darkened Shrines.” We decided to take things down a different path- We caught out a few extraneous elements, and just made things really savage. In regard to the songwriting process, was it the same as other records, or did you try a different approach this time around? It was a slightly different approach, since before we’ve worked with drum machines and computers, and for “Annihilation” we had a live drummer. He was in on things from the start and it made a really cohesive union between the guitar, bass and drum arrangements. You elected to work with Neil Kernon for I really like the packaging. Did you guys intend on making it a digipack? That was Orion’s idea. We like it too. The lyrical explanations are some of your very best in my opinion. I just wanted to ask some questions about a few in particular: “Dusk Falls”' You talk about your use of the MIDI, so I was just curious as a band that employs various technologies to assist in bringing your music to life, what do you think the role of electronics is in death metal, with things such as triggers, samples, loops? I think with any fun toy, there is a use for them in a musical way, hut it’s possible to abuse them. Electronics are just another musical tool. “Cast Down The Heretic”- 1 always wondered myself why you hadn’t chosen to do a piece about Akhenaten. Such a fascinating character, not because he was great, but because he wasn’t, yet he tried (and in spots, succeeded) to change the entire theology and culture of Egypt in many ways. Which makes me wonder, who are better examples of leaders for study: those who are of poor quality, so we can learn from their mistakes or others of high caliber, who are worthy of followers, admiration and allegiance? What were some of the other possible treatments of Akhenaten that you had brainstormed? I think you have to study both. You really can’t have one without the other. To appreciate something 22 AMP “Man, that pitbull...they loved that dog. They fucking did all sorts of crazy shit with it. Yeah, they fed it live cats. They’d put it in one of the backrooms, and then throw a cat in and close the door. The cat would be trapped inside with this huge pitbull. I mean they definitely encouraged that dog to be vicious.’’ ' great, you have to understand what make6 one really bad. As for other treatments, well I’d just lather shy away from that, (laughs) I don’t want Id drag out everything, it’s like having to listen to all your outtakes. So, is this your way saying you haven’t gbt all night to explain them all? (laughs) (laughs) No, I’m just saying I’m too embarrassed to go over many of them. “User'Maat-Re”- Similar vein of my last question. 1 thought about your comments on parental drive, the ghost figures of ancestry, who make so many struggle to be the very best; is it a good thing or a bad thing? Being a father yourself, any thoughts? I was somewhat reminded of the idea you expressed in “Black Seeds.” That when a wrong is done, it plants a seed in someone, and that hatred grows. Do you think Rameses has something like that in his system, his soul, but instead it was a drive to succeed at all costs? Well, as far as my kid goes, he likes- music and has a guitar, hut I encourage him to do fyis own thing always. I’m going to push him to death. I mean, I liad no real desire to follow in my father’s footsteps, he’s a computer programmer. I have zero interest in . that. With some people it’s really strong, but in my life, rhaven’t actually experienced it. For Rameses, yeah there had to be something, how else could you get a guy motivated like that. “Burning Pits”- Will you ever play it live, since it causes you such physical pain? We didn’t play it on this tour because there wasn’t much of a point since it was an opening slot and we only had 45 minutes. We are talking about doing it on the next tour though. “Slave Stick”- Such a terrifying form of torture, but I have to ask, which method of torture practiced in history do you think is the worst? I’m going to go with walling myself. , Wooden spike through the testicles; that one always made me cringe, (laughs) ; “Spawn Of Uamenti”' I think you one upped Punchy’s use of the “Star Trek” sample on your solo record of atmospheric winds. “Bull Crocodile' Mating Call” is pretty damn hard to beat, (laughs) ' When I came across that on the Internet, I was laughing so hard at the whole preposterousness of it. Yet, when inspiration strikes, you just got to go with it. “Annihilation of The Wicked”' Last time we talked, you told me you had a greater appreciation for early Egyptologists. What consistently draws you to the work of Sir Wallis Budge? He was the product of a past century, and he clung onto a lot of ideas that were fairly improbable but overall, his stuff makes for the best death metal . songs.. It’s funny when you talk about people wanting you do to “epic” songs, because I think Nile really has defined what an epic song is. It’s • not necessarily a certain length, it’s just the grandiose nature of it all. Do you agree? Most definitely. I think that there are/were some bands that have a knack for doing stuff that sounds huge, cinematic; grandiose is an excellent descriptor because the music is so massive. Emperor was really great at it. Some Iron Maiden music even had that; and gave it a monumental: feel. Rock music has had it for awhile, with bands like Led Zeppelin who did “Kashmir’ and other epic sounding tunes. Your remembrances of the Carolina death metal scene, the late 80’s and especially the rise of Morbid Angel are well documented in Albert Mundrians’ excellent book, “Choosing Death.” How did you get hooked up with the project, and did you enjoy recollecting all those times? Some great stories are in there. My favorites are the one about the speaker war, and the fact that back in the day, you could have Morbid Angel wash your car. Also, did MA really feed live cats to a pitbull? I’ve spoken with Albert several times over the years as he’s profiled, interviewed and reviewed Nile. He was a really fascinating guy, and I definitely clicked with him really well. So when he started writing his book, he got in touch with me. In regard to the Speaker war, man, that was hilarious. They had these speakers that were seriously at least four feet tall, and they’d just try to destroy each other. That house was nuts, it was fucking crazy. Man, that pitbull. ..they loved that dog. They fucking did all sorts of crazy shit with it. Yeah, they fed it live cats. They’d put it in one of the backrooms, and then throw a cat in and close the door. The cat would be trapped inside with this huge pitbull. I mean they definitely encouraged that dog to be vicious. They would even bring the dog to the gigs, and chain him up to the side of the stage, chained righjt to the PA speakers. I’m really not surprised about anything with that dog., I remember one time I let them stay in my house back in the day and they were in this school bus. They were going to crash at my apartment, and my girlfriend had these beautiful Persian cats. As soon as Trey and Richard brought the dog in, fucker went nuts and tore through our apartment. The cats were terrified and my girlfriend flat out said they were not bringing that: animal in here, he’s got to stay on the bus. So Trey and Richard got a hotel room for the two of them and that fucking dog. (laughs) Well as a vegan* I can’t say I approve, but Ley, I’m sure Glen Benton does, (laughs) (laughs) Probably. How did you get in contact with George and how have things been going with him? George is a great guy. He has worked so mbtherfucking hard for this band. 1 can’t say enough gck)d things about him. We saw him first when Nile vplayed with his band in Greece and when it came time for a new drummer, Derek Roddy’s initial suggestion was him. Derek was just going gaga over George. He definitely had the skills that we needed. He really slaved away and it shows. No disagreement. I mean; I don’t think you can . get a mor^ rousing endorsement than Derek Roddy saying you’re a great drummer. (laughs) That’s true. What about joe? A lot of people have been asking about him I’m sure, especially with his young age. How has he adapted to being in Nile? His playing and his onstage performances are great. During the rest of the day/well he’s youthful and inexperienced, so there is a bit of clash, since Dallas and I are much older and have been doing this for some time. It’s somewhat like if you had to hang out with your Dad all day, how fast would you get on his nerves. 7 1 think that is a hit what’s like. Does Nile have touring plans for the fall? , We got a headlining run over Europe, which should be a lot of fun, then hopefully we’ll be doing a headlining run in the US. Being an elder statesmen of the death metal scene, what do you see as better and/or worse about the present day community, as opposed to the early days? I really don’t claim to be a spokesman for the entire genre. Honestly, I just feel honored to be able to play this music and have fans. I’m definitely grateful to the metal scene. I don’t ever want to seem pompous or act like I know everything. It’s a big scene with lots, of different Opinions and viewpoints. It’s a combined effort on a lot of people’s parts. What keeps you involved in death metal/Nile after nearly a decade? I don’t know man. There is just something very . primal when you first pick Up a guitar and strike that big E'chprd. It just grabs you, and that connection right there is a timeless thing. I got to have that. 1 have to play my guitar at crushing volumes; I Couldn’t be without that feeling. This is all I want to do. There’s no really crazy or elaborate answer. It’s just what I love. K AMP 23 incredible. A friend I grew up with through school. His name is Jami£ Scott. He is amazing!!! O rigin are one of the most popular and respected technical death metal bands going today. With their potent musical napalm of blast beats, smoldering riffs, and sickening vocals, they have captivated the scene and fans across the world. Guitarist Paul answers my questions of the recording process, videos, the popularity of extreme music and touring. How do you view the growing popularity of extreme music? Do you believe that its integrity' is being crushed under the weight of capitalist enterprise or is it’s increased presence on mainstream radar a boon for underappreciated and often poorly funded bands? It’s the circle of life... Bad hands will come <$c go... The strong will survive <$c new hybrids will continue to form & improve the scene... 1 Are you planning to shoot any videos for “Echoes of Decimation”? Yes... Origin has gone through some line up changes in its lifetime, so would you mind starting off with the present roster, and a little bit about what you’ve been up to since “Informis?” James Lee Vox Clinton Appelhanz Guitar Mike Flores Bass James King Drums You are a group I’ve heard many metal/hardcore bands say they wish they had the talent of, especially in your technical abilities. Who inspired you initially, what drives you to better your playing, and how do you feel being hailed as one of the greats of technical death? That comes with time..cThe bands continue to get better & better &. push us too l am just of fan of music played with conviction... I like shred stuff to brutal death to classical music... What does the band name mean to you? It’s a word that creates question. ..It’s a beginning of something but everyone has different beliefs & starting points so its up to personal interpretation... Origin has been around for nearly 8 years. Do you feel that you’ve accomplished all you set out to when you started this band and how do you feel the metal community has changed since your debut? We have more to do but the reemergence of Headbangers Ball & Fuse has definitely put peoples eye back on the market... How was the recording process for “Echoes of Decimation,” who did you work with this time, and how do you feel it compares to your last record? We worked @ Black Lodge Studios (CoaleSceThe Esoteric-The Getup kids, etc., etc.) We recorded with Clinton Appelhanz & Rob Rebeck... What are your thoughts on the growing role of technology in the metal scene, i.e. the active use of ProTools for recording, and more controversial devices such as triggers for drums, etc? If its advancing & enhancing the music so be it!!! What are your tour plans in 2005? We just did a East coast tour & we will be going out 50 shows in 51 days... There will be more tours after that... Check www.origim site* com or www.relapse.com under the tour pages. The artwork for “Echoes” is quite imposing. Who is the party responsible for its creation? It was done by Robert Black He does ink work too... this was airhrushed... How is life with Relapse? All is Well here... We have more work to do!!! Who designed your website? It looks Last words? Thanks again. 24 AMP o If you wouldn’t mind introducing yourself and your duties with ALOL? My name is Robert Meadows and I sing for the band. Where are you guys from, who else is involved, when did the band form and what releases do you have out? Two of the guys live in Bucks County, PA, while the other three guys live in New Jersey. The band started in the spring of 1999, We released “Open Your Mouth...” in 2000 on Loudnet.com, a year and a half later we released a five song CD on Robotic Empire called “The Fourth Plague: Flies”, about three months later we released a seveh inch version of the Robotic Empire release on Deathwish; Inc., and we followed that up with our Deathwish, Inc., full length called “A Great Artist” in 2003. We released “Open Your Mouth...” again in 2004 on Robotic Empire. That is it I think... > How old are you guys now? I remember when “Open Your Mouth Forth Speechless...” came out, you were all pretty young. Wasn’t your drummer like 15? The youngest guy in the band is 20 and the oldest is 2 5. You’ve had quite a few labels over the years including Loudnet, Robodog (RoboticEmpire), Deathwish and now, Ferret. What has led you to so many different homes, and why did you choose Ferret over other potential suitors? We still remain close friends with Andy Low and Robotic Empire. For what we Wanted to do with the band, Ferret was the best way to go. What does the title mean to you? It is the internal struggle of finding happiness, sanity, safety, trust, etc... We are all HUNTERS in some way or another. Life is not easy and you will struggle. Who are you working with producer and studio wise this time around? We worked with Rob Caggiano (Anthrax, Cradle of Filth, Bleeding Through) for Scarp 60Productions. You can really tell how mature the song writing has gotten with His help. X The layout for “A Great Artist” was fairly powerful and eye catching. What do you have planned for “HUNTER?” Paul Ramano (Mastodon, The Red Chord) will be taking charge with the artwork for this record.t Wait till you see what he has come up with. What is the writing process like in ALOL? Someone will come in with a few riffs pieced together. We then move this and take our that. For HUNTER we practiced five days a week for about six hours a day; a more intense writing process for this CD then “A Great Artist”. Do you have any particular agenda/ message with your lyrics, any political or social content? I am not confident enough to talk about politics and religion, so I tend to focus on relationships more. Relationships with friends, family, etc... I see more negative in people and usually try not to trust people all that much. Is A Life Once Lost a full time band, or are you still holding down day jobs when not on the road? The band is our job. Speaking of touring, what’s on tap for this spring/ summer? We are out on The Sounds of The Underground Tour featuring Lamb of God, Clutch, Opeth, Madball, Gwar, and many more. After that we leave for two weeks to the UK and Europe for a few shows with Every Time I Die, Twelve Tribes and Misery Signals. September and October are going to be pretty crazy for us. Vegan? Straight Edge? Neither. Who makes the finest cheese steak in Philly? Jim Steaks on fourth and South. Favorite shop on South Street? Jim Steaks on fourth and South. Better summer time tool: Slip ‘N’ Slides or Super Soakers? That wouldn’t work in the van to well. Musician you’d most like to murder: You can use this for black mail later in my life possibly. Last words? “We don’t get high. ..we stay high!” R feel that your chops eradicated any doubts crowds/listeners may have about members being in their teens? ^Well, I think that perhaps our age was more of a disguise when we were super young/ Although the demo is not completely pitiful, it is not very good, at least when I listen to it. The fact that we were so young eradicated the doubts of some fine tooth listeners, simply because pf our young age, I think that people were more' amazed, but overall, I think our music has spoken for itself! We have definitely played shows where everyone is starring at us before we start looking like, “What the fuck is this? daycare?” and . then being completely shocked after our set that we were playing at the same arid even sometimes a higher level then well- aged metal/ hardcore bands. The. age thing worked both ways for us, some people .were doubtful and some were favored us for it. Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, a scene with a very rich metal/hardcore history, how did its past/present acts influence Animosity? Living in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area has, influenced us in a tremendous amount of ways, far beyond simple musical influences. I believe that everything from our ideals and lyrical content to the music that we play to who we are as people is deeply rooted here in the Bay. Most noticeable on Shut it Down, we are heavily influence from local thrash bands like Testament, Violence, B ay Area deathcore unit is taking things over. If you don’t know that now, you soon will. Although relatively young in actual and musical age, this talented outfit has more chops than a butcher shop and skills that rival bands with more than double their years. Blackmarket Activities will . be dropping their latest, “Empires” on August 23rd/and I chatted it up with vocalist Leo Miller about that particular record; touring, their triumphs and tragedies, and their guitarist’s very metal uncles. Exodus, and early Metallica. At the same time, we also looked to local bands from the other end of the spectrum like Hoods, sind Sworn Vengeance for musical influence. I remember a time when basically if you lived in the bay area, all of your favorite bands did too. It seems like at this point, hardcore and metal have grown so much that location rarely correlates to a bands sound. If you wouldn’t mind, could you please the band did not really pick up until Navene When Animosity began, you had more give a history of Animosity? Koperweis and his Brother Sean joined of a mix of thrash and hardcore going Fresh out of middle school, I was set on the band in 2002. Now in 2005 with our on. While the newer material still has starting a hardcore/metal band for a couple second release on its way, our current and the hardcore edge, I definitely hear a years. The entire hardcore world had hopefully final lineup is Frank, Navene, strong progression towards death metal •already captured me at a super young age Chase, Dan and myself (Leo). We have and grindcore. Is that a move the band and pretty much received my undivided toured the entire country, and made deals has been making over the years? Do attention by the age of 12. As I entered high with both Tribunal records (shut it down) you consider yourselves to be more of school I immediately met Nick Lazaro, who and Black Market Activities (Empires) and . hardcore band or a metal band? What recruited his best friend Frank Costa to start had a ton of fun. do you think about the growing merger the band. Along with another kid from between the two scenes after many years our high school, Us four were animosity You guys formed at a relatively young of separation? for about a year... the youngest band that age, and have done quite a bit in the I think that our progression towards death nor-cal hardcore had ever seen. Since then; four or so years you’ve been playing. metal was pretty natural. We have always Frank and myself are the only two remaining Yet, Animosity always played extremely had death metal elements in our music, ! it plainly and spare the bullshit. ..Death metal rules and it is the most brutal style of music. Although we don’t consciously make decisions to change our sound, changes have definitely occurred over the years, I think it just has to dp with our personal listening habits and the fact that we are all simply getting better at doing what we dp. As far as what we label ourselves, we have all decided that clamping on to a specific title not only limits our musical progression and our fan base, but more so is just simply stupid. There is a lot of baggage that comes along with being called a metal band Or a hardcore band, we have love and respect for both and if you ask me, they are one in the same. Furthermore, we all listen to tons of music. ..music that isn’t metal or hardcore. Also a lot of our new album takes influences from other more unlikely sources like ]i mi Hendrix and Frank Zappa to nk me a few. You’ve had quite a few line up ehanges from the early days. How have they affected the progress of the band! Do you ever wonder what migh"
