        "text": "(Note - This is an excerpt from my book “How to Run a Boutique Yoyo Business”, available in Print on all Amazon platforms, Kindle, and most e-book platforms.)\n\nThe Ducc\n\nThe Yoyo design process is a blend of both science and art, mixing aesthetics and function. I am not a yoyo designer. I’m an ideator. My skills revolve around generating ideas and building a story. When planning a yoyo release for Rain City Skills, I work rather backwards. I first decide what idea I want to sell and start building the story. Then I narrow down a type of yoyo that will fit that idea. Then I connect with an experienced designer to turn that idea into a quality design. Part of success in business is knowing your strengths and knowing when to hire experts.\n\nThis section begins with the creation of a design and interviews with experienced yoyo designers. From there, we move into finding a shop and getting your yoyos made. I conclude with strategies for selling them, so you can move onto the next design.\n\nFor starters, I want to share a project from the beginning of 2018. This case study demonstrates the process of design, testing, and production, as well as some of the pitfalls to avoid.\n\nDesign by Committee\n\nI decided to organize a community yoyo design with the Facebook group “Yoyo BST & Talk.” Devin Flores (A yoyo designer) offered to help out by creating the actual design schematics. We started with broad specifications and narrowed down to the small details. Each step involved a survey of the community, basing the next aspect of the design on that information — a total of twelve design questions listed below. In the end, we had a yoyo design.\n\nThen I ordered a batch of prototypes. I decided to work with the company Magic Yoyo to machine the parts, as they are affordable. Prototypes are usually ordered in very small batches (four-five pieces) and cost far more than the full production run does. On average, I usually pay US$250–$300 — about US$60 per yoyo. But this yoyo was different. Over one hundred people helped design it, so I decided to invite them to test it as well and took pre-orders for prototypes.\n\nWe ended up with more orders than I expected and quickly reached the point where it was cheaper to make a hundred yoyos. Everyone understood that they were gambling and that the yoyo would likely have flaws. That is why you prototype your design after all.\n\nI ordered the yoyos and waited. As soon as they arrived, I shipped them out to everybody who pre-ordered and then put the rest up for sale. I was very, very clear that they were prototypes and had flaws. I then send out a form with some key questions for feedback. And boy, was there ever feedback!\n\nTesting a Prototype\n\nThis design had more flaws than any prototype I’d ever made. In hindsight, that shouldn't have been a surprise, considering how experimental the design process was.\n\nThere were 2 major flaws to consider. If you are a non-yoyoer reading this, forgive the jargon. I’ve provided a diagram in appendix A to assist with part names. The recess for the response pads was too shallow, so the pad stuck out a little bit. The gap was a little too thin to start with, so the response pads dragged against the string and cut down spin time. The thumb grind lip came out razor sharp. This had the double effect of being hard on the hand as well as having an easily damaged edge.\n\nIn the end, the prototype was not the best yoyo, but it was fun to play with, and everybody enjoyed it because they’d been part of the process. It’s a testament to how important engaging with the community you try to sell to is. I took all the feedback and put it into a re-designed yoyo. This time, I ordered the usual batch of a half a dozen prototypes to double check whether our changes improved the design. To my great relief, they did! I released another batch of a hundred of them.\n\nIt was a bit of a crazy process that I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. It required a lot of time on my part and on that of the designer I was working with. It didn’t make me any real profit, but it did pay off in other ways. I ended up with a much stronger presence in the community and a handful of new and dedicated fans.\n\nThe Questions\n\nHere is an outline of the questions I asked the community to vote on. Each step informed the next. I would put a poll up for two days, then hand the results to Devon Flores to come up with some “renderings” or computer-generated images of the design. Then I’d pose the next question, gather results, and he’d use the chosen design to start adding details. Here are the questions I asked, having decided to use 6061 aluminum to keep the product as affordable as possible:\n\nQuestion 1: General Shape (O, V, H, or W). This was a starting point, with each of these broad shapes having a huge number of potential variations. The result was close, with 38.5 per cent in favor of an H shape. The next closest option (O shape) had the support of 30.4 per cent.\n\n(See appendix A for examples of the general shape options).\n\nQuestion 2: Ballpark specifications. For each of the three choices, I offered four options in 2 mm increments: diameter range (50–58 mm), weight range (58–68 g), and width range (38–48 mm). These needed to be rough, as later design decisions would affect the final specifications.\n\nThe result was 54–56 mm diameter, 64–66 g weight, and 44–46 mm width.\n\nQuestion 3: Hub design. We were choosing among fingerspin friendly, Lego compatible, and rounded bump or spike. Lego was the clear winner.\n\nQuestion 4: Gap design. We offered four computer-generated options as the shape of the gap. The one close was actually closer to a “W” shape than the “H” shape we initially chose, but the design would be refined back towards the “H”.\n\nQuestion 5: Inner thumb grind lip (Yes or No). They chose to have a lip.\n\nQuestion 6: Wall height (distance from the outside of the response pad to the point where the yoyo curves outward). The vote was overwhelmingly for a low wall.\n\nQuestion 7: Since we chose a Lego hub, I provided some options for what logo I’d include. They chose a Lego head and a small rocket engine. This was the only step where I disregarded the poll. Once the name was chosen, I tracked down some yellow 1x1 blocks with an eye on them that resembled a duck eye.\n\nQuestion 8: Accessories case. This question was a filler while I waited for the designer to generate examples for the next question. Still, it was an important question, since Rain City Skills is all about the extras. We settled on a fluffy duck zip-up coin pouch.\n\nQuestion 9: Refined gap design. This step was more about the aesthetics of the gap design. Four choices with a similar overall shape but with some detailed “cuts” (shallow grooves) were proposed to change the look.\n\nQuestion 10: Sticker Design. I put a call out for artwork. Then, we voted on which drawing to use.\n\nQuestion 11: Cup Design. We offered three design options. This was the part of the design, which had the most room for variation, and we could have spent weeks on it.\n\nQuestion 12: Laser engraving. I called out for artwork and then offered five options for voting. We actually ended up with a different logo, and as I look back, I can’t remember how. I think someone submitted a design after the fact, and everyone loved it.\n\nThose were the main survey questions I ran through Google drive. I also did a less formal survey directly in the Facebook group to decide on the name and on the spot where the engraving would be placed on the yoyo.\n\n♦♦♦\n\nThe whole process could have gone on for a lot longer. In the end, I ended up walking the fine line between having (1) enough community involvement and (2) fatigue from reading and analyzing too many survey posts. I still had a skilled designer generate renderings for me (3D pictures of the yoyo based on the drawings). Overall, it was a very successful project, and I’m glad I undertook it.\n\nThe Convoy is the September release in the year of maddness - 12 months, 12 yoyos.\n\nQuick review:\n\nThe Ducc, The Loonie, The Retro-Rocket, The Metalhead, The SETI, The Loonie (American Edition) The Sk8r (SB Edition), The Author.\n\nI’m stunned and delighted that not only have I managed to keep up the rate of releases, but you all have been so supportive! Much thanks!\n\nOnto the Convoy\n\nI’ll get into the backstory on the name below, but we’ll start with the release details.\n\nThe convoy is a hybrid ‘0’ shape yoyo. The gap curves out from the bearing area, then flattens out for the rim. This makes for a really comfortable feel in the hand, as well as a unique weight distribution. We opted for 7075 aluminum for this release, a decision I’m very happy with. Aside from the increase in durability, 7075 aluminum can be machined thinner than 6061 and allows for different weight distribution options (Learn more about yoyo materials in my book “How to Run a Boutique Yoyo Business”).\n\nWeight - 64.2g\n\nDiameter - 54mm\n\nWidth - 47.5mm\n\nBearing - Groove Concave\n\nWe initially decided to offer 2 colourways. Cory picked a Navy blue and sand fade for the USA, and I selected colours based on the Canadian Red Ensign, Canada’s flag during World War 2. Since September ended up being the release month, it only made sense to release it on ‘International Talk Like a Pirate’ day, Sept. 19. So we added a solid black yoyo with Skull and Crossbones engraving. Waylon Crase did the design for the engraving, as well as the fantastic release logo.\n\nThe unboxing experience is exactly what you’ve come to expect from a Rain City release. Cory and I put some serious effort and a lot of facebook discussions into packaging. As alway, I wanted to be able to offer an affordable yoyo with an amazing experience. We decided to deliver your yoyo in a packing crate. A durable craft paper box with a yoyo packed tight with shredded wood for extra protection for those long sea voyages!\n\nThe box also includes a bunch of rain city stickers and trading cards, a small wood piece (anchor or steering wheel) and a mini figure. We matched those to the colourways. For the Canadian yoyo I picked a British sailor with musket (old school, right?). Cory went the other direction. I didn’t catch it until they arrived, but he picked a Star Trek figure! Which kindof fit the stereotype of the US military vs Canadian. Of course, there had to be a pirate, so the black yoyo comes with a set including a pirate, treasure, parrot and a skeleton!\n\nYou can find the Convoy on September 19th at\n\nraincityskills.com\n\nyoyoexpert.com\n\nyoyosam.com\n\nyoyostorerewind.com\n\nThe Story\n\nCory Gardener (the madman behind Broke Village) approached me a while back. I usually try to relate the theme of a yoyo to something about the people involved. The Sk8r fit Coffin Nachtmahr becuase he’s an avid skateboarder. The Metalhead was a great fit for Thomas Velto becuase he’s a guitar player and a heavy metal enthusiast.\n\nWhilst brainstorming, Cory’s day job (The USA Merchant Marine) came up and there was our connection.\n\nWhen I was one year old my mom divorced my biological father and moved back up to Canada from the USA. We moved into my grandparent’s basement suite (I’ve go a picture somewhere of me age 3 holding a hammer because I was ‘helping’ with renovations). My grandfather was the main male influence in my life. He is where I get my terrible sense of humour from (allll the puns). One of my must amusing memories of him was the many times my grandmother would be yelling for him across the house. I’d run in and tell him. He’d take a minute to turn his hearing aid back on, then go see what she wanted, muttering about the hearing aid needing a new battery.\n\nGrandpa lost his hearing as a result of his time in the Canadian Merchant Marine during World War Two.\n\nFor those who don’t know what that is, the merchant navy was arguably the deciding factor in Britains survival during the war these ships carried supplies across the ocean that kept the English fed and armed in the year before the USA finally joined the conflict. These boats were prime targets for German submarine attacks. According to this article, over 50% of the Merchant ships were sunk. Sailors who managed to survive the initial sinking all too often died in the freezing Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe really crazy thing was that these sailors (including my grandfather) weren’t considered veterans, and thus didn’t receive any of the government support or recognition the rest of the armed forces did after the war. It wasn’t until the year 2000 that my grandpa was recognized and received a small pension. The money wasn’t the issue, it was the acknowledgement.\n\nThe United States Merchant marine transports supplies all over the world in support of military efforts. One of the reasons you’ll Cory posting about this yoyo only intermittently is because he’s often out at sea and out of range of internet!\n\nThe Rain City Skills “SETI” started life a year ago as a random design inspired by a yoyo Jensen Kimmet handed me to try at Worlds. I came home and messaged Justin to say “We need something with a really big diameter. He sent me a design and I threw it at a new shop to see if they were worth working with. They weren't, the YoYo came back with a bearing seat too narrow. We had an oversized, responsive slimline!\n\nWhile I didn’t use that shop again, I did throw some old Yoyojam Shims in the prototype and try it out. I was stunned. I was expecting a half-decent, silly YoYo. What I got was a really, really good silly YoYo. It went on the list while we tried to work out a theme.\n\nMy first idea was to call it the cereal bowl. Theme it around Saturday morning cartoons. I’d get some custom packaging made in the fashion of old single-serve cereal boxes (the kind you could actually use as a bowl). Perhaps even include a compostable plastic spoon!\n\nUnfortunately (or fortunately) I waited too long and another company released a YoYo called “The Bowl”. I sat on it for a bit. While waiting for just the right theme to appear I sent it off to another shop to test and it came back perfect.\n\nAt some point Waylon Crase and I were chatting and he suggested the name SETI, since the shape also resembled a satellite dish. It was perfect! I’d get some alien lego figures, and have some fun with the colourways!\n\nI can’t recall when I had the idea for the engravings, but I suspect it came out of my frustration with anodizers. A far too large percentage of each run of yo-yos ended up b-grades because of anodizing flaws. Solid colours and engravings avoided that issue.\n\nWhen it came time for packaging Waylon scored again with the ridiculous, almost origami boxes. They’ve been a pain to ship, and I can’t package up the run and shelve it because the boxes are too big! I instead have to assemble the package for each YoYo as it ships out. But they are really cool, so it’s’ 100% worth the extra time!\n\nI’ll leave play and performance up to the reviewers, suffice to say it’s definitely not the YoYo you will win the world championship with. But it is one you’ll have a really good time playing with.\n\nSpecs:\n\nWidth: 40.5mm\n\nDiameter: 67.8mm\n\nWeight: 67.8g\n\nGroove Concave Bearing\n\nWhat's in the Box?\n\n2x Rain City Skills Thin String\n\n1x SETI sticker\n\n1x Lego compatible Alien Figure\n\nA grab bag of assorted lego pieces to customize your throw!\n\nYou can get yours exclusively at www.raincityskills.com, just follow the link below.\n\nDon’t forget to sign up for my mailing list to be the first to get updates and sneak peeks, as well as deals and give-always!\n\nThe Metalhead. Last year Magic Yoyo released Dylan Kowalski’s signature YoYo, the Hotdiggidy. Within a week Thomas Velto and I were chatting and decided he needed a signature YoYo as well! The Metalhead was born. I left Thomas to create the basic design. Joey Serrano of 2Sick Yo-yos lent a hand to draw up Thomas’s design. We talked about a nice big, wide performance YoYo.\n\nThe first prototype played great, but had too many sharp edges and cuts. It lacked a refined feel. So We worked a little more to round out the edges without compromising the play. The decision to use a traditional hub instead of a Lego hub was actually something of an oversight. I legitimately forgot to add he design feature. When we got the 2nd prototype I brought it up with Thomas. We agreed that we didn’t want to mess with how great the throw played, so we left it. As it turns out that was the right decision, we accidentally ended up with a really good finger spin cup!\n\nThe theme. I’ve been wanting to make “The Metalhead” for a while, but didn’t have a YoYo to go with the design. One of the local Yoyoers in Vancouver, Joey Hockin, is also a growing force in the BC heavy metal community. I wanted to make a YoYo he could sell at shows. When Thomas and I started talking, it clicked into place!\n\nI asked Joey if I could share his story, here it is!\n\n“My first experience with yo-yoing was in the summer of 2001 when I was 12 years old. There was a booth set up at the Calgary Stampede sponsored by Duncan. It featured future world champion Jensen Kimmitt. I became instantly addicted and spent that whole summer practicing in my backyard. A few years later, around 2008, we had the first Alberta Yoyo club (YORAD) meeting with myself, Jensen, Steve from SPYY, Chris from CLYW and Michael Witteman. I was introduced to the unresponsive style of play and the competitive side of yo-yoing. Over the next couple of year, I placed top 10 at a couple of competitions including western regionals and nationals. I decided to step back from competitions and treat yo-yoing as more of a creative endeavour than a competitive one. This is where I’ve always found the most joy in yo-yoing anyways, as the creative aspects of it align more with my interests. This brings me to the other big hobby in my life, METAL!\n\nI started out like most metalheads my age, listening to Linkin Park, Sum 41 and the like back in 2001. I worked my way through every style of heavy music you can imagine until I found my love for European styles of metal. In September of 2009 I was lucky enough to see Edguy, Stratovarius, Dragonforce, Sonata Arctica, Epicurean, Luna Mortis, Viathyn and Kobra and the Lotus all within a week. Since then I couldn’t get enough of that feeling and my life has pretty much revolved around metal since.\n\nEvery single year I’ve managed to make it to at least a couple of festivals. My travels have taken me to a dozen different countries to see epic shows and be more a part of this global metal community. After trying to get my own band off the ground I decided it was time to make the move to Vancouver where the metal scene is much more alive. I finally formed my band, Apprentice, and started playing shows in early 2015.\n\nIn 2016 I started Journeyman Productions (a logical name to follow Apprentice) and started promoting metal shows in Vancouver. Now we have a small team of people that are dedicated to fostering the growing metal scene. We enjoy every second we spend making sure bands have opportunities to grow and get to play in front of a larger audience. In late 2018 Apprentice finally released our first album “The Strength of Mortality” which is the culmination of the work of most of my adult life. If you get a chance we’d really appreciate you checking us out online at any of our social media. Give our album a listen on pretty much any major platform where you can find music!\n\nI’m unbelievably stoked to have in my hands a toy that brings together 2 of my life’s biggest passions in a high quality package. This will definitely be my main throw. I look forward to introducing yo-yoing to members of the metal community as well as metal to members of the yo-yo community. The similarities between the 2 might surprise you as they both involve a lot of creativity and personal style! So get on your favourite band’s shirt, throw on our album and give the Metalhead a spin!“\n\nJoey gave me a discount on downloads of “Strength of Mortality” so I could include it with the Apprentice engraved edition of the metal head for half price. If you choose a different colour, you can still pick up the album and their merch at\n\nApprentice - Bandcamp\n\nIf you are looking to score a metal head, click the “Buy Now” button below to take you to the Rain City Skills store.\n\nThe Sk8r will be available at yoyoexpert.com, yoyosam.com and returntopshop.com for $64.99. I’ll also be selling extra colouring books at Returntopshop for a limited time, just in case you wanted one to keep as a collectable. Or give to a friend. Or if you wanted to colour a 2nd one yourself ;)\n\nThe Sk8r comes in red, white or black with either purple or black hubs.\n\nSpecs:\n\nDiameter 52.95mm\n\nWidth 42.2mm\n\nGap 4.2mm\n\nWeight 62.4g\n\nBearing Size C Flat\n\nMaterial Delrin\n\nThe Story\n\nRain City Skills x Oh Yes Yo\n\nWhen I approached Coffin Nachtmahr Of Oh Yes Yo with the idea to do a collaboration called the skater, he was 100% on board right away. His first suggestion was that the name needed to be spelled Sk8r. From there, designing the yoyo to look like a skateboard wheel was a given. Justin Scott Larson went to work taking Coffin and My ideas and giving them shape. The design he came up with was nearly perfect, as always! What wasn’t a given was finding the right machine shop. This is the most prototyped yoyo I’ve ever made. We started this process in the beginning of 2018.\n\nWe started with one shop that I’d worked with before for begleri. We sent them 2 variations, one 59g, one 63g. They did a good job of the body, but were unable to make the hardware properly (the hub wasn’t snug against the body, so it tended to slip instead of screwing together tightly). It did give us the opportunity to bring the prototypes to PNWR in Seattle where we learned that the yoyo community was of no help making decisions. We had 2 weights options and we left the contest with pretty much a 50-50 split between people that liked one or the other!\n\nOnto a 2nd machine shop. This time I used the same shop that made the Rain City Skills ‘Showgirl’. Again, we tested 2 variations to make sure the hub design would work. This time they nailed it, fantastic! Except in the time between ordering the prototypes and actually getting them the shop seems to have run into some trouble. As soon as I got the prototypes my contact stopped responding.\n\nFinally we ended up at Yoyoempire. I really should have started with them, they have made more Delrin yoyos than just about any other brand on the market and have the experience needed to get it right. So a 5th prototype was made to make sure they had the design right and bam, ready to go!\n\nIn the interim between the various prototypes I was busy crafting the unboxing experience. This is where Coffin had his chance to shine. He is a professional artist. He makes his living with his art and yoyo sales. He drew up the sticker logo, blending the 2 brands and the skateboard concept. I hunted and found lego skateboards and paired them with an assortment of mostly horror or science fiction villain themed Minifigures. There are about 50 varieties spread amongst the 150 Sk8rs made. Jack from “Nightmare Before Xmas” makes an appearance, the Scream guy, Donald Trump, various mad scientists, there may even be a Sith or two in there.\n\nThe idea for the big ‘enxtra’ came at USA nationals in 2018. Coffin was drawing up label cards for the Boutique Yoyo Collective table and we came up with the idea to include a yoyo colouring book! I sent him home with a list of yoyo words (bind, whip, slack, etc) to outline in graffiti format. So each Sk8r comes with a collectable colouring book that even has a drawing of a Coffin and I!\n\nThe finishing touch was packaging. Coffin sent me a photo of skateboard wheels shrink-wrapped and pointed out that this was do-able at home. I popped onto amazon, got some shrink wrap and tested it. You can do it at home with a hair dryer, but it’s not super effective. So next stop was the hardware store for a heat sealer and heat gun. I then spent most of the Canadian Thanksgiving long weekend splitting my time between packing to move and shrink wrapping yoyos. As you can see in the images below, I added in a basic fingerboard that makes a perfect display stand!\n\nAll in all this has been a really fun project. At some point I’m sure I’ll run out of ideas for interesting themes and accessories, but I’m really digging the creativity that goes with it. I’m looking forward to my next collaboration and where 2019 takes Rain City!\n\nJust for fun, The Sk8r drops on October 24th, my birthday! So if you needed any more incentive to grab one, think of it as my birthday present!"
