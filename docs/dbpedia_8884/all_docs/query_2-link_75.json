        "text": "Tradition has it that when husband and wife marry, his becomes the family name. Modern times have seen this trend frequently bucked, but Nashville’s Kopecky Family Band kicks it square in the teeth. Singer/songwriter/keyboardist Kelsey Kopecky is the only member who actually has the name on her birth certificate, with the five gents in the band carrying it like proud brothers. After a banner 2011 that saw them named as both one of the Best Live Acts and Best New Bands of the year by Paste Magazine, the happy Family is ready to self-release their debut LP, Kids Raising Kids, on October 23rd.\n\nAs a sample of what they call their “modern, more aggressive Fleetwood Mac” sound, check out the clip for lead single “Heartbeat”. Filmed on just a $9.00 budget (we’re guessing the cost of tennis balls and a peach), the charmingly awkward clip sees the band spending a day on the tennis courts. They don’t so much practice their backhand as they do clumsy dance moves, but hey, they were voted Best Live Act, not Best Dancers/Tennis Players."
