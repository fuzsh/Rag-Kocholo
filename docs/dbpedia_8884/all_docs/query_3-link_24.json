        "meta_description": "Yes, Nashville's Kopecky Family Band might have a wholesome-sounding name, but this sextet of friends are ferocious road warriors, touring steadily for nearly five years before releasing a debut album, Kids Raising Kids, in October. Despite the group's Tennessee roots, they fall more firmly in the Jack White camp of that region's indie rockers and are reminiscent of Grouplove, Little Green Cars, Arcade Fire and Of Monsters and Men — there's barely a country twang to the Kopecky Family Band's music. If you happen to live on the Western half of the North America, you can see the Kopecky Family Band on tour in December, beginning this Sunday, December 2, in Norman, OK. The band recently came by The Alternate Side's Studio A for a session that we'll post this winter; in the meantime, check out this TAS live performance below of the Kopecky Family Band playing \"Heartbeat.\" [video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjglP-hvbkg]",
