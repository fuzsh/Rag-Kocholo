That’s the case with Nashville’s Kopecky Family Band, a group of instrument-swapping coeds whose songs bridge the gap between sweeping chamber-pop and indie rock.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nDirected and produced by J. Bryan Dill, this live performance of “Angry Eyes” shows the band at the full reach of their abilities. They jump between tempos, pile their harmonies into stacked boy-girl harmonies and barrel toward a pulsing, bass-propelled finish. The setting is a familiar one — the house that doubles as the band’s rehearsal space — and the sound quality is great, proof that several hundred tour dates alongside groups like The Lumineers, Devotchka, and Gomez have whittled this band’s broad sound to a fine point."
