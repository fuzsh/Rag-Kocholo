        "text": "Skrizzly Adams\n\n.\n\nKelsey Kopecky\n\nFor me it all started in my dad's garage up in Minnesota. He played John Mellencamp and The Beach Boys while I roller skated round and round singing at the top of my lungs. My goal in music is to take myself back to that garage, to tap into the wildness of going all in, no brakes, and laughing like a maniac the whole time. When I'm doing it right, I'm a kid again, and I don't wanna grow up.\"\n\nFresh off 10 years touring with college friends turned band brothers in Kopecky Family Band, Kelsey Kopecky is ready to take her own name. She's trading her keyboard for an electric guitar and writing songs in a new garage. The result is a lo-fi dream pop diary of songs called, \"The Babysitter ep.\" \"After taking a break from the road, I got a job babysitting an 8 year old firecracker, Kelsey says. \"I used the money to record my first solo album, and the result is something that embodies me both then - in my roller skate fervor - and the here and now. I can't wait to share it!\n\nThe Babysitter Ep is out Valentine's Day 2017!\n\nJoshua Black Wilkins\n\n."
