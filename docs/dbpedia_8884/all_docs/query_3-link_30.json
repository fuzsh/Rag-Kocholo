        "text": "RACINE - \"Welcome to the ice box,\" Joe Kopecky says, leading his two brothers into the sparsely decorated and rundown rooms above Horst's Music Store in Downtown Racine.\n\nPictures of '80s metal bands like Judas Priest, Sacred Reich and Rattlesnake dot the walls, a stack of posters from Nasty Habit, one of Joe and his brother William's distantly past and mostly forgotten bands, are stacked on the floor, and maroon carpeting from the building's previous tenant, Ala Rug, hangs from the walls for acoustic\n\nprotection.\n\n\"This is what gives us our unique sound,\" Joe, 36, says, with William, 34, finishing his thought, \"It brings out the tortured artist in us.\"\n\nIn contrast to the stark decorating and the frigid temperatures the winter winds outside bring to the room, the music the band Kopecky makes, with Joe's guitar, William's bass and their third brother Paul's drums - he's 32 - is lush, warm and complicated. The progressive rock genre that Kopecky works and plays in allows them to expand beyond any prescribed formulaic sound.\n\nWithout the aid of any vocal lyrics, the brothers paint a vibrant picture as they trade riffs between their well-played instruments - almost like listening to a musical conversation.\n\n\"We've always been fans of intelligent music\" Joe says. \"We've always prided ourselves on being good musicians. We aspire to be like the musicians who inspire us.\"\n\n\"At a young age we had contact with some excellent musical material and each wrote quite a few original songs,\" William remarks. \"We got sick of playing in any number of area cover bands and decided to get together as brothers and play what we truly love. The bottom line is, for us it is most fun to play.\"\n\nKopecky has built on its ever-changing free-form rock since deciding a band of brothers was the way to fulfill each of their musical goals. And while they have remained based in Racine, they initially found their first big break and a huge fan base thousands of miles away.\n\nIn 1999, an Italian record label heard a copy of a homemade demo tape the band had put together. Mellow Records wanted to produce and release the band's debut album, but they had one stumbling point - they had no way of contacting the brothers. The band's Web site, www.Kopecky.8m.com, was nonexistent at the time, and their copy of the tape had no contact information besides the band's name.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"They had to seek us out,\" William explains. \"They e-mailed a number of Webzines who had reviewed our work and had to really hunt us down.\"\n\nAll of the band's albums since have been released by European labels and, despite the fact they have never toured outside of North America, they say they have sold five times as many albums overseas than in the United States, a testament to the strength of their recorded\n\ncatalog.\n\nKopecky's self-titled debut was followed by \"Serpentine Kaleidoscope\" and a live album. They are working on the soundtrack for \"Goodbye Tomorrow,\" an independent film being shot in Racine. The brothers' newest album, \"Sunset Gun,\" has been released by Musea records, a French company, and will be celebrated with a CD release party at McAuliffe's Pub Friday night at 10.\n\nThe new album continues the band's progression. The songs are unpredictable, intricate pieces that build on the interplay of the separate musical layers. The brothers continue to mix the music they listen to with their own emotive states.\n\n\"(Our music) comes from all over,\" Paul says. \"I listen to anything - country, rap, progressive rock. If you are really into a band, you'll hear bits of that come out in the songs.\"\n\nPaul is undoubtedly the quietest of the three brothers, but what he lacks in spoken words, he makes up for in the pounding rhythms and sturdy beats he lays down as the band rehearses. William's fingers slide effortlessly along the neck of his fretless bass as Joe runs his pick up and down the strings of his electric guitar.\n\nAll three perform with stern faces as they play their darkly tinged music. But as staid as their songs and their performing personae are, these are still brothers who are having a great time making music.\n\nA declaration that the three always get along well in a very un-brotherly way is met with a playful \"Stop (expletive) me off!\" When asked if the lack of vocals in their music was a conscious decision, William begins with a serious answer.\n\n\"We had been in vocal groups for a long time,\" he says. \"We thought it would be a lot more expressive to concentrate on our instruments.\"\n\nJoe quickly interrupts his brother with a sly grin and declares, \"Of course, everyone knows that we sing like birds.\"\n\nThe brothers all share a laugh before lunging into their next song.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
