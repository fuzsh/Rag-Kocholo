We have added it to a personal playlist for you.\n\nNashville's Kopecky Family Band aren't actually related, but the six-piece's natural chemistry could easily fool an unfamiliar listener. The group debuted with a full-length, Kids Raising Kids, last year, but they've been playing together since 2007 and have released a handful of EPs along the way. The group stopped by The Current's headquarters and played an intimate take on the tune \"Are You Listening.\""
