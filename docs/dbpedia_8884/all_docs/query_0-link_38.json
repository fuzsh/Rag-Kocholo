        "text": "Colorado can take a small bit of ownership over Kopecky Family Band, the indie-pop act that’s starting to make a name for itself since signing to ATO Records and scoring sets at many big summer festivals. Drummer David Krohn grew up in Littleton, though, this was of course long before the Nashville band was getting comparisons to Fleetwood Mac from the New York Times and co-headlining tours with the Lumineers.\n\nSee photos of Kopecky Family Band at Outside Lands Festival below.\n\nKopecky Family Band stopped into Denver’s Uneven Studio earlier this month to record a few songs for Reverb’s Mile Marker. The band then popped up to San Francisco to play Outside Lands Music Festival and is back in Denver on Monday for a show at the Larimer Lounge.\n\nDuring its Mile Marker session the band recorded three tracks with us — each from the debut album “Kids Raising Kids.” You can listen to and download “The Glow,” “Heartbeat” and “Angry Eyes” below.\n\nFollow our news and updates on Twitter, our relationship status on Facebook and our search history on Google +. Or send us a telegram.\n\nReverb Managing Editor Matt Miller has a really common name so please use these links to find his Twitter account and Google + page. Or just send him an email to mrmiller@denverpost.com.\n\nBryan Feuchtinger is a freelance audio engineer and owner of Uneven Studio. Want to record your music? Contact Bryan here."
