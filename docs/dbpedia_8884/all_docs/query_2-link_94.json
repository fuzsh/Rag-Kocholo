        "text": "From Dramaturgy Fellow Cody Kour\n\nIn 1975, the Khmer Rouge, an extreme communist party led by Pol Pot, emptied Cambodia’s capital city of Phnom Penh and took control of the country. The party’s stated goal was to bring Cambodia back to a simple, agrarian society defined by social harmony, but the reality was a regime ruling through fear, distrust, and violence. By the time the Khmer Rouge was ousted by Vietnamese troops in 1979, the country had over 2.5 million dead, no infrastructure, and a traumatized populace. To this day, Cambodia and her people have yet to fully recover.\n\nTo share this history, Lauren Yee’s play Cambodian Rock Band excavates the barrier between past and present as it jumps between 1978 and 2008. As it does so, the play mines a sort of remedy for the horrors of the past—a chance at reconciliation, redemption, and inner peace.\n\nThe wounds the Khmer Rouge wrought upon Cambodia in the name of progress not only affected the people but Khmer culture as well. From 1960 up until 1975, Cambodia was experiencing what has retrospectively been called “Cambodia’s Golden Era of Music.” Khmer musicians such as Sinn Sisamouth had crafted a unique sound by blending traditional Khmer music with rock and pop influences from Latin America, Europe, and the United States.\n\nOnce the Khmer Rouge took over, Pol Pot declared it was Year Zero and intended to “purify” Cambodia of its past in favor of a communist future. Anything having to do with the West, the past, modernity, urbanity, or individuality was considered a threat to their new utopia. Suspected or accused dissenters were taken away, imprisoned, and executed. This included creatives, intellectuals, religious leaders, teachers, musicians, artists, capitalists, monks, and anybody else deemed unnecessary or threatening to the new regime.\n\nFamilies were torn apart and reassigned to villages or camps across the country because all of Cambodia was now considered one’s family, a comrade. Marriages were arranged by the Khmer Rouge, and premarital sex was punishable by execution, as was dancing, painting, singing, writing, praying, and playing music. The uniform of the entire country was black clothing with a red krama, the symbol of the party. Food was heavily rationed, and the population was starved in the name of the “greater good.” Khmer Rouge leaders were characterized by their greed, corruption, and hypocrisy. The only certainty during this time was death.\n\nStill, the truth about how people were able to survive the genocide is often messier and harder to pin down, as shown by Chum’s difficulty in facing his own past in the play. Similar to how one’s actions may echo into the next life, he—and the audience—are haunted by the play’s live band as it brings up memories of a happier time long past.\n\nUltimately, I find Cambodian Rock Band to be a journey toward acceptance. Buddhists believe in Karma: that our present and future lives are subject to the actions of our past lives. However, this idea can also create a sense of powerlessness, similar to how the Cambodian people were unable to stay out of an unwanted war, or how they couldn’t save their country from themselves. From this seed of despair grows a melancholy acceptance—one rooted in futility, but also displaying the grace and beauty of defiance.\n\nIt’s this beautiful melancholy that ultimately bears the fruit of resilience, one that beckoned the Khmer people to survive even when facing death daily. That spurs a child to search for a sliver of truth in the darkness. For a musician to play on, despite the world ending.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nThe Jungle Theater creates courageous, resonant theater that challenges, entertains, and sparks expansive conversation.\n\nOUR VISION\n\nTo be a neighborhood theater with national impact, indispensable to our community and aspirational to the field.\n\nOUR VALUES\n\nSTORIES MATTER\n\nBecause we believe in the power of live theater to interrogate and celebrate our shared experience, we create work that helps our audience make meaning of the world and deepen connections with each other.\n\nARTISTRY IS A HABIT OF ATTENTION\n\nBecause we believe that exquisitely crafted theater makes us feel more alive and calls to our highest potential, we pursue beauty in our work by practicing care and attention to detail in all that we do.\n\nA PLAY ISN’T COMPLETE WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE\n\nBecause we see our audience as our final collaborators, and because we believe meaningful encounters demand intimacy, we strive to make the Jungle a place where all are welcome and everyone is home.\n\nA GREAT THEATER CARES FOR ITS PEOPLE\n\nBecause the work we make and share depends on human time, labor, and love, we are committed to being good to one another. This means we challenge one another creatively, value each other’s time and talent, and collaborate in a spirit of good will and abundance.\n\nJUNGLE THEATER STAFF\n\nArtistic Director | CHRISTINA BALDWIN\n\nManaging Director | ROBIN GILLETTE\n\nArtist and Audience Services Manager | BARRY INMAN\n\nAdvancement & Artistic Associate | ALISON RUTH\n\nMarketing Manager | CARLY CAPUTA\n\nFinance Manager | FIONA ROBINSON\n\nProduction & Facilities Manager | MATTHEW EARLEY\n\nSeason Stage Manager | JOHN NOVAK\n\nArtistic Cohort | SEQUOIA HAUCK, JUCOBY JOHNSON, JAMES RODRÍGUEZ, ANGELA TIMBERMAN\n\nDevelopment Consultant | DON SOMMERS\n\nFront of House | Anika Barland, Kendra Buro, Adam Clair, Shalee Mae Cole Mauleón, Arianna Diaz-Celon, Jessica Goldade, Rossi-Anne Jaffe, Clara Kennedy, Reanna Madson, Zach Staads\n\nJUNGLE THEATER BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nBen Scott (Board Chair), Juliane Ray (Board Vice Chair), Barbara Klaas (Treasurer), David Dobmeyer (Secretary), Erika Eklund, Andrea Fike, Kelly Kita, Karl Lambert, Nancy Monroe, Kelsey Norton, Erin Oglesbay, Juliane Ray, Peter Scherf, Marcia Stout, David Weinstein"
