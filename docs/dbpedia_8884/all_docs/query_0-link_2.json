        "text": "On the Verge: The Kopecky Family Band creates own kin\n\nKindred spirits: The members of the Nashville-based sextet aren't related; they're a metaphorical family. Kelsey Kopecky and co-founder Gabe Simon met about six years ago at Belmont University. \"One night I invited some people to my house to play board games, and we started passing a guitar around,\" Kopecky says. \"Gabe played a song that really moved me and I thought: He's my soulmate.\" But in a purely platonic, musical way; Simon's married and Kopecky is dating drummer David Krohn's older brother. \"We wrote six songs in just a few times of hanging out and that's so inspiring,\" she says. As far as the band's name goes, \"Gabe used to call me Kopecky and (it) just stuck.\"\n\nSince the duo got the ball rolling, they've collected four band members: Krohn, bassist Corey Oxendine, cellist Markus Midkiff and guitarist Steven Holmes. The twentysomethings released their debut album, Kids Raising Kids, in 2012, keeping the family theme going with their upbeat eclectic blend of \"a little My Morning Jacket, a little Fleetwood Mac.\"\n\n\"We're away from our families because we're on the road so much we've become each others' support,\" Kopecky says. \"As you grow older, whether it's the president of the United States or your grandparents, they all have a part in molding your life, in raising you, in a sense.\"\n\nThumping along: Single Heartbeat, which peaked at No. 7 on USA TODAY's adult-alternative airplay charts, is based on a real-life experience. \"I was waiting for a date to pick me up from my house in Nashville, and I came up with the bare bones of this song,\" she says. \"We're easily moved by events and most of what we write about is true.\" The group has certainly amassed plenty of song material over the years. \"One time we were playing a gig at a brewery in Louisville, basically for free beer,\" she says. \"We didn't have a place to stay, so this sort of sketchy guy offered his house. He said he was a CD radio repairman, but he had a really nice house. Turns out he was a drug dealer.\"\n\nWorst first job, ever: \"I worked for a gun club when I was a teenager, launching clay pigeons into the air, and if I didn't do it at exactly the right time, they would get so mad at me,\" she remembers. \"We all had to wear earplugs, but I was so scared that I might not hear someone yell, 'Pull,' that I sometimes didn't use mine. I was the only girl there and the boys made me do all the dirty work, like picking up gun shells. I always went home from that job bawling.\"\n\nFinally, a break in the clouds: After years of roughing it out on the road, the group got a little assist from Mother Nature herself during the 2011 Bonnaroo festival. \"We were one of the first bands to play, we were on this tiny stage and no one was there,\" she says. \"Then, there was this flash flood and a rush of people ran over to our stage, suddenly our area was swarming. I remember calling my mother to tell her my dreams were coming true.\" The band has also played Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and Outside Lands.\n\nFueled by ambition: Even when the band was at its worst, financially speaking, the group kept touring, kept rehearsing in the studio, sometimes starting at 9 a.m. on Saturdays. \"Once, after getting home from a tour, I had five dollars in my bank account. So I brought all my change to (a) Coinstar (machine) and got $13 out of it,\" Kopecky says. \"I thought, I'll buy eggs and popcorn, but not cheese. If it weren't for people having us over for spaghetti dinners or letting us wash our clothes, we'd never have made it.\""
