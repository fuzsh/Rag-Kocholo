        "text": "Indie rock bands are available in an abundance in the music industry at the moment, but I think that Kopecky Family Band really have something special that other bands are lacking. Every band member in an instrumentalist, and they use everything from a classical cello, to the same synths used on EDM tracks, and the fusion of these sounds creates something really fresh and original. Seeing artist who can support themselves on their instruments whilst singing is refreshing, and the harmonies that Kelsey Kopecky and Gabe Simon create together are stunning and goose bump worthy.\n\nThey opened the show with The Glow where Simon was on acoustic guitar, and Kelsey on keys, with the other members on their respective instruments. Their talent is like nothing I’ve seen live before, and everyone was cheering from the moment they started playing. As well as their incredible song writing skills, the fact that the majority of the band members are multi instrumentalists is incredible, and watching them jump from guitar to horns, and cello to synth is exhilarating and a real showcase of talent.\n\nThey were also great at interacting with the audience, encouraging us to sing along, and move forward to dance with their more up tempo songs. Although Kids Raising Kids is their only album at the moment, they told us that there’s another in the pipeline, which is super exciting and hopefully means another tour!\n\nRead more"
