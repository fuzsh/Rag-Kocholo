        "text": "Hopefully you've had a great Memorial Day Weekend so far, but it isn't over yet. Monday night, the Casbah welcomes Kopecky. Formerly known as Kopecky Family Band, they've set their roots in Nashville and have just released a new record. They've played San Diego so much over the years that they kind of feel like family. Meanwhile, Soda Bar hosts the amazing talent of multi-instrumentalist Lo-Fang, who will certainly bring a wowed hush over the crowd. Tori Roze returns to Bar Pink, and L.A. Witch play the Hideout.\n\nMonday, May 25:\n\nKopecky, Armors, Spero @ Casbah\n\nLo-Fang @ Soda Bar\n\nSultry Monday with Tori Roze & the Hot Mess @ Bar Pink\n\nL.A. Witch, Pree, G.
