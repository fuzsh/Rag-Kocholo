        "text": "Flashback, 2012, I woke up in a tent in a back yard. Wait an hour to use a shower because there are about ten heads in front of me, some of whom are hacking up all sorts of disgusting stuff from a virus that they caught along the way. The way being a horrible ride from Los Angeles to Austin, TX that saw us on the side of the road fixing an engine more than it saw us on the actual road, and culminated in me using a jerry-rigged hand pull ignition to coast us into Texas, the coup-de-gras being when we arrived and I vomited into a trash bag. Those are just a tinge of the memories that I have from our first experience with the monstrosity known as SXSW. Somewhere else in that file lies the distinct recollection of a group of singers and instrument swingers named the Kopecky Family Band. Somewhere over the last few years they’ve decided to ditch the “family” tag and just go with Kopecky. I don’t know if that’s due to an equally bad experience at SXSW 2012, who knows, perhaps we played a part. What I do know is that when they asked for a do-over in 2015 we gave them a totally different experience. Nobody was sick, nobody slept in a tent, and we had an actual bathroom for Kelsey Kopecky to do her makeup in before the shoot. Yup, big changes have come and are coming and that’s the way the world goes round. See y’all at the next memory…"
