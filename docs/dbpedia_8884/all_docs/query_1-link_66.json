        "text": "Like all families, Kopecky Family Band beats with the same heart and writes in the same blood. Whilst the band might not share actual familial bonds, the ties that keep this Nashville 6-piece together are just as strong. The Family began creating music together in Nashville in Fall 2007. What began as late night talks about life and dreams gradually flowed into eccentric, beautiful music. The bandâ€™s tunes are emotive, the lyrics evoking raw honesty and vulnerability. They will undoubtedly capture your attention with their unmistakable power and presence.\n\nLast fall, Kopecky Family Band released their latest album, Kids Raising Kids. Tonight, the band will be playing a show at The Parish."
