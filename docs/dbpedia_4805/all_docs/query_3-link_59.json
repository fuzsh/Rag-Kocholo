        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis birth cohort consisted of all women giving births (n = 1,344) during an 18-year period in Eastern Greenland amounting to 5–10% of all births in Greenland. Data were extracted from the National Greenlandic Birth Registry based on the individual civil registration number.\n\nOverall, most women in Eastern Greenland gave birth spontaneously, and vaginally with a very low rate of interventions. Most of the women lived in Tasiilaq, the largest town in Eastern Greenland, and gave birth at the hospital in Tasiilaq. There was a relatively high proportion of very young women giving birth as well as being single parents. This may reflect cultural patterns and socio-economic circumstances and may further contribute to the increased rate of preterm births found in this Eastern Greenland birth cohort [8].\n\nThe majority, 68% of the women in Eastern Greenland, live in one of the two small towns, Tasiilaq or Ittoqqortoormiit, the remaining live in one of the five settlements. A total of 36.2% of the birthing women are single parents, and previous rapports have shown that approximately a third of the population live in overcrowded houses with two or more persons in each room [22]. The women have experienced several previous pregnancies with a mean of 4.4. Half of the women in the cohort had three or more previous pregnancies and only 14.6% had not been pregnant before. A relatively high proportion, 14.5% of the women, was between 13 and 18 years of age when giving birth; in Denmark, this number is 4.2% [23]. The fertility rate in Greenland was 2.1 in 2019; in Denmark this rate was 1.7 [24,25].\n\nThe average number of antenatal midwifery visits during pregnancy was 6.7 times, which is close to the seven visits recommended in Denmark and an average of 1.7 times at the general practitioner equivalent to half of the three visits recommended in Denmark [26]. Antenatal visits are important to improve pregnancy and birth outcomes but also to the level of public health (28). However, 23% of the women had not visited a doctor and 5.2% had not visited a midwife during pregnancy. According to the Greenlandic health authorities’ guidelines for maternity care, all women should be offered a minimum of three and preferably up to ten antenatal consultations with a doctor, midwife, or health assistant [27]. At least eight antenatal visits are recommended by WHO [28].\n\nThe characteristics of the birthing population are similar to other remote areas concerning maternal age at time of birth and number of previous pregnancies but different compared to the Danish population [29]. Girls and young adults who become pregnant before the age of 18 years are more likely to experience violence in a marriage or partnership [30]. Approximately half (54%) of all women in Greenland have been sexually abused before the age of 15; in around six percent this happened before the age of seven [31]. The inhabitants in the settlements have half the income compared to citizens in Nuuk [32]. Lack of food has been reported, and socio-economic conditions have not yet reached those achieved in Western Greenland [33].\n\nExposure to poverty in childhood has an impact on health status including long-term health [34]. Initiatives with focus on improving the living condition in the community may not only improve the social situation for pregnant women but also have an impact on later development of chronic diseases in the offspring [34,35]. Referral to a centralised birth facility before the onset of labour has been used as a way to improve maternal and child health [5]. For some women, centralisation may improve a present medical challenge: However, referral does not change the influence of impaired social and living conditions being one of the primary conditions affecting maternal and child health [5]. Further, evidence has shown midwifery-led continuity of care in areas of high socio-economic disadvantaged populations may improve outcomes for both mother and child [36].\n\nMost of the women living on the east coast give birth in Eastern Greenland whereas 15.2% give birth in the capital, Nuuk situated on the west coast. This contrasts with 38.3% of women from all coastal towns in Greenland being transferred to the specialised obstetric unit in the capital Nuuk in Western Greenland to give birth [37]. All women from the coastal towns in Greenland can choose to give birth in their hometown or in Nuuk also if there is no medical indication. However, women living on the east coast may face another challenge if transferred to Nuuk. The east coast is called Tunu by the west Greenlanders, which means “backside”. Tunu can be perceived as a negative term, and people from the east coast have reported to experience stigmatisation when staying in Nuuk [38]. Further, the language used on the east coast also differs from the language on the west coast.\n\nMany families from the settlements on the east coast have family in Tasiilaq. When pregnant women leave the small settlements to give birth in Tasiilaq, the partner and family can accompany them and live with family maintaining the birth as a family event. This may not always be possible if the woman gives birth in Nuuk unless the partner or family pays for their own travel, which is too expensive for most of the families [5,39]. It is common and very important that the whole family is close to or around the woman when she gives birth as childbirth is both a family and community event [5,7]. Previous research has found evacuation of the birthing woman away from her hometown and family may increase the woman’s level of stressors including the experience of loneliness, missing family members, experience substance abuse, and child neglect as an unintended consequence of a centralisation of birth [7,10,40]. Further, being evacuated for birth has been found to be cultural disruptive [17] instead of cultural safe which is essential for remote area populations [8,41,42].\n\nMany issues in addition to obstetrics risk play a role during decision-making on place of birth [43]. Professionals’ perceptions of clinical risk are often privileged over social risk. Quality of care is traditionally only measured in relation to mortality and morbidity for the mother and the child.\n\nHowever, the consequences of the organisation of maternity services in remote areas do not only have implications for the health of women and children but also for family members such as siblings. One example may be the health and social consequences for a sibling to be left alone or placed into care if the mother or the parents are transferred to Nuuk for a longer period prior to the birth. This situation may also increase the likelihood of sexual abuse of children [31].\n\nAssessing individual obstetric risks is important but not the only important assessment in the decision-making process. The evacuation policy in remote areas has been experienced by the women as a no-choice policy [44]. Personal logic is one of eight forms of logic that Daviss [45] developed to describe what is at stake in decision-making. Personal logic is individual, and families make decisions on what they stand to lose or gain on a personal level from a birth plan and make compromises. Economic consequences, the situation of their children or other family members and community obligations may be considered when making decisions on place of birth [1]. The family may be an important resource during childbirth and transition to parenthood, but it may also be an issue of conflict and stressors [43].\n\nIn Eastern Greenland induction and augmentation of labour were experienced by 10% of the women. In Denmark, 26.8% of the birthing women experience induced labour and 16.1% augmentation of labour [46]. For Danish nulliparaous women the induction rate is 22.8% and the argumentation rate is 39% [47]. The use of medical pain relief during labour is also low. Only 18.3% of the women used pain relief during labour and birth. The pain relief data are specified for use of nitrous oxide, (1.8%), morphine (4.8%) the remaining includes anaesthesia during caesarean section, as well as pain relief for other interventions such as suturing of birth tears, but they are not further specified. Epidural analgesia is not available in Eastern Greenland, which may perhaps also explain the low rate of interventions. Assisted birth using vacuum extraction was used in 0.5% and use of episiotomies was used in 2.3% of the women. The caesarean section rate was 6.5% and of these 4.8% were emergency caesarean sections, and 1.7% were planned. At population level, WHO recommends caesarean section rates around 10–15%, as higher or lower rates may be associated with increased maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality [48]. Low intervention rates in labour and birth are also found in other remote settings [13]. Evidence from Canada demonstrated that rural maternity services may improved population health outcomes more than centralisation of maternity services [4,49,50]. Lower rates of preterm birth and low birth weight are found when women are provided with continuity of midwifery care in remote areas [8,51].\n\nCaesarean sections are rarely performed in Eastern Greenland. However, the local emergency caesarean section service in Tasiilaq is important as transfer during birth is rarely possible. The overall, caesarean section rate in Greenland was 9.7% in 2018 [37]. The caesarean section rate in Greenland is very low compared to the rate of 20% in Denmark (36) and some places even higher internationally [52]. Women who need a planned caesarean section are referred to the hospital in Nuuk before birth where the caesarean section rate was 3.9% for planned and 8.8% for acute caesarean section [37].\n\nThe low intervention rate may be explained by factors inherent in the population or the cultural setting and in the way maternity care is practiced. In Tasiilaq, cardio-toco-graphy (CTG) is not used for foetal monitoring neither is epidural analgesia for pain-relief during birth. Both interventions may induce a cascade of interventions [53] and thereby increase the use of interventions in otherwise uncomplicated labour and birth. Watchful attendance [54] and one–to-one midwifery practice is the basic model of care during labour and birth in Tasiilaq. These models of care are known to contribute to low intervention rates and a better birth experience [55,56]. Information on birth experience is not provided in the medical registry and it is therefore not possible to include the women’s own experience of birth in this present study.\n\nIn the East Greenlandic cohort, most children were born at term (89.9%) and almost all children (99.8%) born at term were born alive. Despite the relatively high rate of premature births, only 5.8% had a birthweight of or below 2500 g.\n\nA total of 2.1% of the babies were born with an Apgar score of less than eight in 5 min. Among the term babies, 0.8% experienced an Apgar score less than eight in 5 min which is comparable to Danish outcomes [57].\n\nIn a survey of 183 Greenlandic pregnant women, 43.3% has a pre-pregnancy body mass index of more than 25% and 46.3% smoked during pregnancy [58]. These high rates may perhaps be a part of the explanation of the higher rate of prematurity [59]. Globally prematurity is the leading cause of death of children under 5 years of age. Midwifery-led care is associated with a reduced risk of prematurity. However, the aetiology is still not fully understood but may be due to the holistic care often provided by midwives including not only obstetric but also psycho-social factors including the whole family situation [59,60]. Further, increasing indigenous governance in maternity services may also reduce the number of preterm births [8]. According to the Greenlandic Health Authorities (Landslægeembedet) only 1.6% (13 birth out of 823) of children born in Greenland in 2018 were born before 32 weeks of gestation and 9% (73 births) were born between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation [37]. Similar rates of premature births have been reported from Nunavik in Canada [61], although higher rates have been reported from other remote areas in Canada [62]. In lower income countries, an average of 12% of babies is born prematurely compared with 9% in high-income countries and economically deprivated families are at higher risk of experiencing preterm birth regardless of geography [63].\n\nThe rate of stillbirth in the Eastern Greenlandic cohort was 0.8% which is comparable with birth outcomes in other remote areas [64]. Autopsies of babies are not systematically carried out in Greenland. However, visible congenital malformations were registered in 2.2% of the newborn babies. Most countries perform autopsies and may therefore report a higher rate of congenital malformations. An increase from 8 to 35 per 10,000 of Greenlandic newborn babies with gastroschisis have been registered with an average proportion of 10.7 per 10,000 [65]. Between 2005 and 2020, at least five babies out of 1,117 were born with gastroschisis by women from Eastern Greenland (information obtained from unpublished local birth reports). Intrauterine exposure to environmental factors and lifestyle habits may influence foetal development and as a result gastroschisis [66].\n\nQuantitative studies of childbirth outcomes in Inuit populations have been criticised for their small sample sizes and statistical uncertainty [16]. Remote areas are sparsely populated and larger sample sizes will thus never be achieved. As a strength, we used a population-based cohort to avoid selection bias and used standard systematically collected data from the medical birth registry providing a low number of missing data (<2%) which is not expected to challenge the validity of our study. The limitation of using the medical birth registry was the lack of selected demographic and medical data as well as social and mental health data. Further studies including physical, mental, and social factors for the whole family as well as the wider community may be valuable.\n\nAll authors of this study are non-indigenous. However, one of the authors (HCFS) live and work as a doctor in Tasiilaq and has done so for the last 32 years. Another author (SH) has lived and worked as a midwife in Tasiilaq over a period for 13 years and in Nunavik in Canada for 16 months, which has provided extensive setting specific knowledge and experience.\n\nOrganising maternity care in remote areas with a mainly indigenous population may benefit from using a public health perspective including cultural, social, mental, and medical aspects."
