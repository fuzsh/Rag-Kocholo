The research area for this investigation was purposively selected as the Vietnam National Academy of Music in Hanoi. The investigation began in October 2012 and was concluded in January 2014. The two key informants for this investigation were expert conductors and teachers at the academy, Dr. Nguyá» n PhÃºc Linh and Dr. Nguyá» n Thiáº¿u Hoa. Data was collected from a combination of document analysis and field research. Tools used for data collection included interviews, participant and non-participant observation and focus group discussions. Results show that both of the key informants for this investigation were born into families of artists and had a particularly close relationship with traditional folk art. Scholarships to study abroad at the Tchaikovsky University, Russia enabled them to learn from Russian conductors and they developed the skills that have now led them to be recognized as being among the most accomplished conductors in Vietnam. The process of instruction preferred by these two academics is taught in three steps: the preparation stage, the teaching stage and the assessment and evaluation stage. The benefits of studying with Dr. Nguyá» n PhÃºc Linh and Dr. Nguyá» n Thiáº¿u Hoa are the cumulative experiences of international conducting practices and the high standards that the two academics possess and demand.\n\nLemba, Artur: Concerto for piano no. 1 in G / Guy S.

Main idea of this research is to uncover and describe the characteristic, func- tion, and role of SaâUnine String Orchestra within the popular culture in Indonesia. This research used qualitative method with ethnographical approaches to identify all facts that discovered during research. The conclusions of this research show that SaâUnine String Orchestra moves in two ways, there are; the idealism which had a vision to create a real Indonesian string orchestra and a part of music industry. At the end, these two ways are connected to each other because of the earnings of those. Music industry becomes a support factor which create the idealism of SaâUnine String Or- chestra to be an Indonesian String Orchestra.

Questa condizione si Ã¨ venuta a creare nonostante in Italia prima il D.Lgs. 195/06, che ha recepito la Direttiva sul rumore 2003/10/CE, e poi le âLinee guida per il settore della musica e delle attivitÃ ricreativeâ, emanate ai sensi dellâart. 198 del D.Lgs. 81/08, obbligano i datori di lavoro a eseguire la valutazione dei rischi. Il presente lavoro riporta i risultati preliminari di uno studio pilota dellâesposizione professionale a rumore dei musicisti dellâorchestra sinfonica di un teatro lirico ita-liano. Sono state effettuate rilevazioni fonometriche su un campione rappresentativo dei componenti dellâorchestra, tramite dosimetri personali e analizzatori in frequenza. Le registrazioni sonore sono state effettuate durante le esecuzioni musicali nella fossa dâorchestra del teatro durante diverse tipologie di rappresentazioni teatrali. ------ To date, in the literature there are few field studies based on the noise risk assessment in opera houses. This condition has come about in spite of the Italian Leg. Decree n. 195/06, which transposed the noise Directive 2003/10/EC, and then the national \"Guidelines for the music industry and recreation\", issued under Art. 198 of Leg. Decree n. 81/08, oblige employers to perform noise risk assessment. This paper reports the preliminary results of a pilot study of occupational exposure to noise of the symphony orchestra musicians of an Italian opera. Surveys were carried out on a representative sample of members of the orchestra, using personal dosimeters and frequency analyzers. Sound recordings were made during the musical performances in the orchestra pit of the theater during the various types of theatrical performances.\n\nSymphony orchestra musiciansâ² use of hearing protection and attenuation of custom-made hearing protectors as measured with two different real-ear attenuation at threshold methods\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nK H Huttunen\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Despite a high level of sound exposure and a fairly large selection of earplugs available, musicians have often been reported to use personal hearing protectors only seldom. For better hearing conservation, it is important to identify and eliminate the causes for the low motivation to use hearing protection. We explored the usage rate of custom-molded musicianâ²s earplugs (ER-15 among 15 symphony orchestra musicians with a questionnaire, and measured the attenuation properties of their earplugs with a Real-Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT procedure in a sound field. Earplug use was found to be low, and the musicians reported that earplugs hampered listening to their own and their colleaguesâ² playing; earplugs affected either timbre or dynamics, or both. Additionally, several reasons related to discomfort of use were itemized, but the musicians who consistently used their earplugs did so in spite of problems with use. The REAT values obtained in sound field were relatively close to the manufacturerâ²s nominal specifications, being 13.7 dB, on average. In the frequency range studied (0.125-8 kHz, individual variation in REAT was, however, up to 15 dB across the measured frequencies. Fluctuation in attenuation might be related to low use of hearing protectors, and REAT measured at fixed center frequencies may be too robust a method to uncover it. We therefore tested 10 additional subjects to find out whether a sweeping signal used in BÎ¹kÎ¹sy audiometry would bring more detailed information on earplug attenuation. Mean attenuation was found to be somewhat closer to the nominal attenuation of the ER-9 and ER-15 earplugs up to about 1 kHz, whereas REAT measurements in sound field revealed more even attenuation at frequencies between 1 and 6 kHz. No significant association was found between earplug attenuation properties and earplug use. It was concluded that support and determination to get accustomed to hearing protector use are important\n\nHow orchestra members influence stage acoustic parameters on five different concert hall stages and orchestra pits\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nWenmaekers, R.H.C.; Hak, C.C.J.M.; Hornikx, M.C.J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nStage acoustic parameters aim to quantify the amount of sound energy reflected by the stage and hall boundaries and the energy decay over time.

Surprisingly, it is unknown whether human listeners can identify sounds as stemming from real orchestras or OSLs. Thus, an internet-based experiment was conducted to investigate whether a classic orchestral work, produced with sounds from a state-of-the-art OSL, could be reliably discerned from a live orchestra recording of the piece. It could be shown that the entire sample of listeners (N = 602 on average identified the correct sound source at 72.5%. This rate slightly exceeded Alan Turing's well-known upper threshold of 70% for a convincing, simulated performance. However, while sound experts tended to correctly identify the sound source, participants with lower listening expertise, who resembled the majority of music consumers, only achieved 68.6%. As non-expert listeners in the experiment were virtually unable to tell the real-life and OSL sounds apart, it is assumed that OSLs will become more common in music production for economic reasons.\n\nMahler: Sinfonie Nr. 8 Es-Dur (Sinfonie der Tausend) / Norbert RÃ¼dell\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nRÃ¼dell, Norbert\n\n1995-01-01\n\nUuest heliplaadist \"Mahler: Sinfonie Nr. 8 Es-Dur (Sinfonie der Tausend).

The work differs from other attempts of sound transposition of seismic records. In this case seismic frequencies are not converted automatically into the \"sound of the earthquake.\" However, it has been studied a musical translation system that, based on the organ tonal scale, generates a totally unexpected sequence of sounds which is intended to evoke the emotions aroused by the earthquake. The symphonies proposed in the project have somewhat peculiar origins: they in fact come to life from the translation of graphic tracks into a sound track. The graphic tracks in question are made up by copies of seismograms recorded during some earthquakes that have taken place around the world. Seismograms are translated into music by a sculpture-instrument, half a seismograph and half a barrel organ. The organ plays through holes practiced on paper. Adapting the documents to the instrument score, holes have been drilled on the waves' peaks. The organ covers about three tonal scales, starting from heavy and deep sounds it reaches up to high and jarring notes. The translation of the seismic records is based on a criterion that does match the highest sounds to larger amplitudes with lower ones to minors. Translating the seismogram in the organ score, the larger the amplitude of recorded waves, the more the seismogram covers the full tonal scale played by the barrel organ and the notes arouse an intense emotional response in the listener. Elisa Strinna's Seismic Symphonies installation becomes an unprecedented tool for emotional involvement, through which can be revived the memory of the greatest disasters of over a century of seismic history of the Earth. A bridge between art and science. Seismic Symphonies is also a symbolic inversion: the instrument of the organ is most commonly used in churches, and its sounds are derived from the heavens and\n\nOnce More unto the Breach: Aesthetic Experience Revisited\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHansen, Forest\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAesthetic experience as a determining factor in music appreciation has lost salience in recent years, especially in philosophy of music education.

Nowadays the problem of creative personality development is relevant, as creative future music art teachers freely orient themselves and guide pupils students in today's cultural environment, music and media space, have a strong musical taste and aesthetic guidelines. The music genre groups have been characterized in the article. It is thought that these groups are the traditional components of repertoire of folk and orchestra student groups: arrangements of folk tunes; works of Ukrainian and world classics, orchestrated for the folk groups, taking into account each orchestra performing possibilities; works by contemporary authors, written specifically for the orchestra of folk instruments. The main methodological principles of selecting the repertoire for the student orchestra of folk instruments are disclosed, including: technical, artistic and performing capabilities of student groups; involvement of works of different genres into the repertoire; correspondence of orchestra scores to instrumental composition of the student orchestra, and their correction if it is necessary; selecting works, whose performing arouses interest of the student audience; using the experience of the leading professional ensembles of folk instruments; constant updating the orchestra's repertoire. In the conclusion the author emphasizes that taking into account the methodological tips helps solve the main tasks within the course of âOrchestra Classâ. These tips are the following: studentsâ acquaintance with the history of foundation, composition, ways of musicianship, technique of playing the instrument of folk instrument orchestra and acquaintance with specific orchestral music; development of all\n\nTowards a Transcultural Theory of Democracy for Instrumental Music Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTan, Leonard\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAt present, instrumental music education, defined in this paper as the teaching and learning of music through wind bands and symphony orchestras of Western origin, appears embattled.

In his 2013 work, Symphony No. 1: Formations, composer Jeffrey Nytch created a work that explicitly communicated the geologic history of the Rocky Mountain west through a musical composition. Commissioned by the Geological Society of America and premiered at the GSA's 125th Anniversary meeting, the symphony is more than merely inspired by the Rocky Mountains; rather, specific episodes of geologic history are depicted in the music. Moreover, certain processes such as metamorphosis, erosion, vulcanism, plate tectonics, and the relative duration of geologic time guided the structure and form of the music. This unique approach to musical composition allowed the work to play a novel and potent role in community engagement and education, both at the premiere performances in Colorado and subsequent performances of the symphony elsewhere. This project is thus a powerful example of how the arts can help illuminate scientific principles to the general public, in turn engaging them and helping to establish a more personal connection to the natural world around them.\n\nNuclear power in the WEC partitions: Jazz and symphony - 5404\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMoncomble, J.E.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe World Energy Council (WEC) has built two scenarios typified by characteristics, which, each from their own perspective, may comprehensively describe large parts of the world in 2050: the more consumer-driven Jazz scenario and the more voter-driven Symphony scenario. While scenarios are 'music based', they are completely different in nature. As an energy scenario, Jazz has a focus on energy equity with priority given to achieving individual access and affordability of energy through economic growth. As an energy scenario, Symphony has a focus on achieving environmental sustainability through internationally coordinated policies and practices. These scenarios are designed to help a range of stakeholders address the 'energy tri-lemma' of achieving environmental sustainability, energy security, and energy equity. The energy landscape we expect to see in 2050 will be quite different from how it looks today. Meeting future energy demand will be a key challenge. The world's population will increase from approximately 7 billion in 2013 to approximately 8.7 billion in the Jazz scenario and approximately 9.4 billion in the Symphony scenario in 2050, which is equal to a 26% increase (36% respectively). The WEC estimates that total primary energy supply (equal to consumption) will increase globally from 546 EJ (152 PWh) in 2010 to 879 EJ (144 PWh) in the Jazz scenario and 696 EJ (193 PWh) in the Symphony scenario in 2050. This corresponds to an increase of 61% in Jazz and 27% in Symphony. In WEC Scenarios to 2050, nuclear energy will contribute approximately 4% of total primary energy supply in Jazz in 2050 and 11% in Symphony - compared to 6% in 2010. More precisely, there is an increase of nuclear capacity (even in Jazz, thanks to demand increase) from 373 GW in 2010 to 481 GW (Jazz) or 884 GW (Symphony) in 2050. Electricity generation from renewable sources (RES-E) will increase around 4 to 5 times by 2050 in comparison to 2010\n\nFantasievoll / Giselher Schubert\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nSchubert, Giselher\n\n2008-01-01\n\nArvustus: Kristjan JÃ¤rvi.

As musicians perform excerpts from Holstâs âThe Planetsâ and other orchestral works, visualizations developed using WorldWide Telescope and NASA images and animations are projected on-stage. Between each movement of music, a narrator guides the audience through scientific highlights of the solar system. The content of Solar System Symphony is geared toward a general audience, particularly targeting K-12 students. The hour-long show not only presents a new medium for exposing a broad audience to astronomy, but also provides universities an effective tool for facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration between two divergent fields. The show was premiered at Northwestern University in May 2016 in partnership with Northwesternâs Bienen School of Music and was recently performed at the Colburn Conservatory of Music in November 2016.\n\nRadiation load experiments with electronic components of the SYMPHONIE satellite\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSpencker, A.; Wagemann, H.G.; Braeunig, D.\n\n1975-09-01\n\nThis report surveys fundamentals, realization and results of irradiation experiments which applied to 36 different electronic components of the Symphonie satellite and which were completed at the HMI Berlin and the C.N.E.T.

This study explored a range of physical and mental health indicators in musicians who played in these different orchestra types to ascertain whether orchestra environment was a risk factor affecting musician wellbeing. Participants comprised 380 full-time orchestral musicians from the eight major state orchestras in Australia comprised of two dedicated pit orchestras, three stage-only symphonic orchestras, and three mixed stage/pit orchestras. Participants completed a physical assessment and a range of self-report measures assessing performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMD), physical characteristics including strength and perceived exertion, and psychological health, including music performance anxiety (MPA), workplace satisfaction, and bullying. Physical characteristics and performance-related musculoskeletal profiles were similar for most factors on the detailed survey completed by orchestra members. The exceptions were that pit musicians demonstrated greater shoulder and elbow strength, while mixed-workload orchestra musicians had greater flexibility Significantly more exertion was reported by pit musicians when rehearsing and performing. Stage/pit musicians reported less physical exertion when performing in the pit compared with performing on stage. Severity of MPA was significantly greater in pit musicians than mixed orchestra musicians. Pit musicians also reported more frequent bullying and lower job satisfaction compared with stage musicians. There were few differences in the objective physical measures between musicians in the different orchestra types. However, pit musicians appear more psychologically vulnerable and less satisfied with their work than musicians from the other two orchestra types.

In this observational study, members from professional and amateur symphony or wind orchestras were asked to complete a questionnaire collecting demographic data, musical, medical, and family history, and data on present visual complaints and/or eye diseases. Questions about playing in the orchestra were also asked. Data from 70 professionals and 48 amateurs showed that most musicians needed glasses or contact lenses for playing in the orchestra (61% of the professionals, 63% of the amateurs). A majority (66% of professionals, 71% of amateurs) had visited an ophthalmologist at least once during their lifetime, and 10% of the professionals and 23% of the amateurs were currently under treatment of an ophthalmologist. Visual complaints while playing in the orchestra were quite common and included poor lighting conditions, problems with reading small notes, blurred vision, tired eyes, and itching or burning eyes. Professional musicians especially reported adverse effects of eye complaints encountered in the orchestra for daily life; 35% got tired earlier and 33% felt that they could not adequately perform their tasks in the orchestra. The results show that visual complaints and eye problems probably are quite common among orchestral musicians and therefore warrant further interest and research.\n\nTemporal interaction between an artificial orchestra conductor and human musicians\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nReidsma, Dennis; Nijholt, Antinus; Bos, Pieter\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe Virtual Conductor project concerns the development of the first properly interactive virtual orchestra conductorâa Virtual Human that can conduct a piece of music through interaction with musicians, leading and following them while they are playing.

It performs three seasons annually: fall, winter and summer, plus many shows of Tchaikovskyâ²s Nutcracker. The 70-strong orchestra plays an average of 360 hours/year including rehearsals and performances. Rehearsals are held at two locations: one in a ballet rehearsal room with little or no absorption, and the other in an acoustically treated location. Performances are held in the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto. The present survey was done at the request of the National Ballet, since the musicians complained of excessive sound levels and were concerned about possible hearing losses. The survey was performed using five dosimeters Quest Mod 300 during 10 performances of the ballet Romeo and Juliet by Sergei Prokofiev, deemed as the noisiest in the whole repertoire. Results of the survey indicate that the noise exposure levels from only the orchestraâ²s activities do not present risk of hearing loss. Exposure due to other musical activities was, however, not included.\n\nStravinsky: Symphonies, Concertos, Ballets and other works / David S.

Romantic period style orchestral music, recognized for validating the use of intense emotion for aesthetic pleasure, was the last significant development in the history of the orchestra. In an age where orchestral popularity is waning, the possibil- ity of evolving the orchestral sound in our modern era exists through the combination of our current understanding of instrument directivity patterns and their interaction with architectural acoustics. With the aid of wave field synthesis (WFS), newly proposed variations on orchestral layouts are tested virtually using a 64-channel WFS array. Each layout is objectively and subjectively compared for determination of which layout could optimize the sound of the orchestra and revitalize the excitement of the performance.\n\n'The stigma attached isn't true of real life': Challenging public perception of dementia through a participatory approach involving people with dementia (Innovative Practice).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nReynolds, Laura; Innes, Anthea; Poyner, Christopher; Hambidge, Sarah\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThis paper discusses the potential impact of viewing public performances of an orchestra comprising people with dementia, family members, student volunteers and professional symphony orchestra members in contributing to challenging negative perceptions of dementia. Negative perceptions of dementia abound despite recent policy attempts to challenge the stigma associated with the condition. This paper reports on the findings from the performance element of a music project for people with dementia, known as the BUDI Orchestra, designed to replicate the traditional rehearse and perform cycle of musicians. Data were collected via self-completion questionnaires from audience members ( Nâ=â109) at three public performances. The performances exceeded the expectations of the general public, and findings suggest a positive impact on perceptions of dementia, demonstrating the power and potential of participatory approaches showcasing the achievements of those living with dementia when attempting to raise awareness of dementia and challenge negative perceptions.\n\nArts Management - marketingovÃ¡ strategie symfonickÃ©ho tÄlesa (Filharmonie mladÃ½ch Praha)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFrÃ¶hlich, VojtÄch\n\n2009-01-01\n\nGoal of this diploma thesis is to create a marketing strategy of the Prague Youth Philharmonic symphony orchestra including marketing concept definition, audience research and marketing communication project.

To evaluate the frequency of CMD and its relation to musculoskeletal pain in various body regions. A questionnaire-based survey approach assessing CMD symptoms and musculoskeletal pain in professional orchestra players was adopted. Relative prevalence rates and prevalence ratios for different instrument groups were estimated. A total of 408 musicians completed the questionnaire (response rate 57%). Playing-related pain in the teeth or jaw was reported by 19-47% of musicians and TMJ pain by 15-34%, depending on the instrument group. Current pain in the face indicating a painful CMD was reported in 6-10% and related symptoms such as teeth grinding in 25-34%, jaw clenching in 33-42% and jaw locking in 11-18% of musicians. Females were 2.4 times (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.49-3.84) more likely to report having had orofacial pain within the last month.

They can be measured as low-level signals in the ear canal and are used to monitor the functioning of outer hair cells.Several studies indicate that OAE might be a more sensitive measure to detect early noise-induced hearing...... losses than puretone audiometry. The distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) fine structure is obtained when the ear is stimulated by dual tone stimuli using a high frequency resolution. It is characterized by quasi-periodic variations across frequency, as it can be observed in the hearing...\n\nThe Art and Science of Acoustic Recording: Re-enacting Arthur Nikisch and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestraâs landmark 1913 recording of Beethovenâs Fifth Symphony\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDr Aleks Kolkowski\n\n2015-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The Art and Science of Acoustic Recording was a collaborative project between the Royal College of Music and the Science Museum that saw an historic orchestral recording from 1913 re-enacted by musicians, researchers and sound engineers at the Royal College of Music (RCM in 2014. The original recording was an early attempt to capture the sound of a large orchestra without re-scoring or substituting instruments and represents a step towards phonographic realism. Using replicated recording technology, media and techniques of the period, the re-enactment recorded two movements of Beethovenâs Fifth Symphony on to wax discs â the first orchestral acoustic recordings made since 1925. The aims were primarily to investigate the processes and practices of acoustic sound recording, developed largely through tacit knowledge, and to derive insights into the musiciansâ experience of recording acoustically. Furthermore, the project sought to discover what the acoustic recordings of the past do â and don't â communicate to listeners today. Archival sources, historic apparatus and early photographic evidence served as groundwork for the re-enactment and guided its methodology, while the construction of replicas, wax manufacture and sound engineering were carried out by an expert in the field of acoustic recording. The wax recordings were digitised and some processed to produce disc copies playable on gramophone, thus replicating the entire course of recording, processing, duplication and reproduction. It is suggested that the project has contributed to a deeper understanding of early recordings and has provided a basis for further reconstructions of historical recording sessions.\n\nNordic Symphony â Grieg at the cross-roads\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKjell Skyllstad\n\n2003-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In music historiography there appears the notion of a Europe musically divided between a central \"universal\" culture and a peripheral \"national\" orientation. 19th century composers of the Scandinavian and East European countries share the same fate of being marginalized as provincial representatives of \"national\" or \"regional\" cultures, in contrast to those that Â»spoke the language of \"humanity\" (Alfred Einstein. In Germany Edvard Grieg is stili derogatively regarded as KleinkÃ¼nstler, who was not able to produce large scale works in sonata form, which alone would qualify for the stature of a \"universal\" artist. WhatÂ we now recognize as Norwegian or national in Grieg's works became carriers of such significance and interpretations only after the composer's death. The hermeneutic descriptive Â analysis and criticism in Germany (Hermann Kretzshmar and Norway (Gerhard Schjelderup narrowed the interpretation of his works.This was further ideologically encased by the upsurge of Norwegian nationalistic music culture in the late 20ties. When Grieg's only symphony was released for performance in 1981 it was stylistically considered as a transition to the \"real\" Grieg with reference to the elements pointing to a national idiom.The author pleads far a more open attitude in approaching the complex nature of Grieg's compositional career. Unbiased analyses of his large scale works, including the symphony, testify to an acute sense of formal structure, even when deviating from the normative requirements of the genre. The artistic legacy of Edvard Grieg, like that of many other composers of \"peripheral\" cultures, need to be examined at the triadic point of dynamic convergence between the national, regional and European, and between stylistic trends, sociocultural background and the development of musical communication.\n\nIntroduction\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRossing, Thomas D.\n\nString instruments are found in almost all musical cultures. Bowed string instruments form the backbone of symphony orchestras, and they are used widely as solo instruments and in chamber music as well. Guitars are used universally in pop music as well as in classical music. The piano is probably the most versatile of all musical instruments, used widely not only in ensemble with other musical instruments but also as a solo instrument and to accompany solo instruments and the human voice.\n\nOrchestra Festival Evaluations: Interjudge Agreement and Relationships between Performance Categories and Final Ratings.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarman, Barry R.; And Others\n\n1991-01-01\n\nBand, orchestra, and choir festival evaluations are a regular part of many secondary school music programs, and most such festivals engage adjudicators who rate each group's performance.

Learner-centered design involves designing software that incorporates work support features (or scaffolding features) informed by social constructivist learning theories. By adopting a constructivist \"learning by doing\" perspective, scaffolds should support learners so they can mindfully engage in previously inaccessible work activity, which in turn allows those learners to progressively gain a better understanding of the new work. While there is an intuitive notion of \"learner-centered design\", there is less specific design information for developing learner-centered software. As a result, learner-centered software results from \"educated guesses\" and ad-hoc design approaches rather than from systematic design methods. Thus there is a need for specific design guidance to facilitate the development of learner-centered tools that help learners see the tasks, terminology, tools, etc. in the new work context and engage in that work. The research in this dissertation provides a more specific base of learner-centered design descriptions, methods, and guidelines to analyze work practices and design and evaluate scaffolds. The research approach involves using the development of Symphony---a scaffolded integrated tool environment for high-school students learning the work of computational science inquiry---as a case study to develop the learner-centered design approach. Symphony incorporates a variety of science tools with process scaffolding to support students in performing complex air pollution investigations. Six ninth-grade students used Symphony to investigate air quality questions for several weeks in an environmental science class. The student testing helped assess the effectiveness of the software scaffolding and in turn, the learner\n\nExpression Surpassing Words: Goreckiâs Symphony No. 3, Op. 36 âSorrowful Songsâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlyssa K. Griffith\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The experience of listening to Goreckiâs Symphony no. 3, op. 36 âSorrowful Songsâ is one that is not easily forgotten. It is not only musically captivating, but also historically fascinating. After its premiere in 1977, Goreckiâs piece captivated listeners across the globe as it became a cultural phenomenon in both Europe and America. The music was a stunning success in both the Classical and popular cultures. What is it about the music that is so captivating? How did the trending, popular thoughts compare to Goreckiâs original ideas and compositional motives? What actually inspired this piece? By looking at the composition and premise of each movement, I am going to introduce how the piece was written around the theme of maternal love and separation of mother and child. The Third Symphony was heavily influenced by Goreckiâs personal past, but also by his Catholic beliefs and by Polish history. The separate texts to this three movement piece deal individually with a motherâs lament over her sonâs departure, the Virgin Maryâs grief at her Sonâs death, and finally the words of an incarcerated prison girl to her mother. Because of the setting from which the third text was drawn, and because of Goreckiâs Polish history and experiences in the post-holocaust world, many people have interpreted this to be a âwar pieceâ which avenges the sufferers of the Holocaust. According to Gorecki, this piece is a lament- it expresses a profound sense of grief which, arguably, cannot accurately be expressed with words. Gorecki used his music to confront, mourn, and express his pain and the pain of many other people. By finding primary sources, such as interviews of Henryk Gorecki, and by looking at the scholarly books and journals by Luke B. Howard, Adrian Thomas, and other scholars of Polish avant-garde music, I hope to properly understand and express the intentions Gorecki wished to convey by writing The Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa Report\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1987-01-26\n\nRadio 2 on 96.2 kHz and Radio 4 on 103 kHz on FM.

The study population consisted of 39 men and 55 women for a total of 94 artists with mean age of 33 years. The ORTO-15 test was used to determine the prevalence of orthorexia nervosa. Those subjects who scored below 40 in the ORTO-15 test were classified as having orthorexia nervosa. Mean score of the participants in the ORTO-15 test was 37.9+/-4.46. A total of 56.4% of the artists involved in the research scored below 40 in the ORTO-15 test. While the highest prevalence of orthorexia nervosa was recorded among opera singers (81.8%), it was 32.1% among ballet dancers and 36.4% among symphony orchestra musicians. The differences between the three groups were statistically significant. No difference was noted between mean ORTO-15 score by baseline characteristics as gender, age, educational level, work experience, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption. The research group have a higher socio-economic and education level than the majority of the general public in Turkey. Additionally, being an artist in Turkey means being a role model for the general public both in terms one's physical appearance and lifestyle. These may be the reason why artists are more sensitive to this issue.\n\nSo What's New?

For them, hearing impairment is due to too loud music, the effect of which, if exceeding the limit depending on the individual sensitivity of oneâs ear, can be compared with theeffect of noise on the ear. Risk factors for its development are: the type of musical instrument and sound character, the way of playing, music genre or composition, duration of exposure to loud music, sound source and its distance from the ear, intervals of acoustic stimuli, individual factors and the musicianâs position in the orchestra. Hearing impairment is greater at higher frequencies; in pure tone audiogram it is shown as notches between 3000 and 6000 Hz and is most frequent in the wind and brass section. Hearing loss is greater among violinists and typically affects the left ear owing to the sound source proximity and their position in the orchestra. The most common health problems take the form of diplacusis, algiacusis and tinnitus, as exposure to the loud acoustic stimulus above 90 dB(A cause damage to the inner ear, the so-called acoustic trauma. Use of personal protective equipment among musicians is low especially because of too much high-frequency attenuation and occlusion effect.\n\nGender Association with Stringed Instruments: A Four-Decade Analysis of Texas All-State Orchestras\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaker, Vicki D.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to track the gender makeup of the five string sections (Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello, and String Bass) of Texas Music Educators Association (TMEA) All-State Orchestras from 1971 to 2010, to determine if a clear gender stereotype was evident in any of the sections and if there had been a trend towards a change inâ¦\n\nTHE FOLCLOR ORCHESTRA AS A CONSERVATION, VALIRIZATION, CAPITALIZATION FACTOR AND MEDIA DISSEMINATION OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCHISELIÅ¢Ä VASILE\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The article is aimed at motivating the necessity to study the professional folk orchestras from the Republic of Moldova as a factor of identifying, institutionalizing, urbanizing, media disseminating, promoting the modern traditional (oral musical sources in the context of the process of negotiating the cultural identities from the modern society (the second half of the 20th and the first decade of the 21st centuries.

We are working in collaboration with a school in Berwins Heights and with graduate students in astronomy from the University of Maryland in College Park under the supervision of Cole Miller. The evaluation of the program is done under the supervision of Hiro Yoshikawa (Harvard University). The program received seed funding from an IDEAS grant awarded to Arthur Bloom in 2003. This unique collaboration provides an opportunity to develop innovative and interdisciplinary educational and outreach materials, leverage investment and broadly disseminate our results, share costs, link with school systems, target underserved and underrepresented populations, cultivate new sources of media attention, and enhance interest and learning in astronomy.\n\nUnderstanding Your Band, Orchestra, and Choir Students: Personality Similarities and Differences and What They Mean for You\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMacLellan, Christin Reardon\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStereotypes about the personalities of musicians, which have evolved over time, seem to direct our perception of musical experiences that take place in different ensembles. This article presents the stereotypes often associated with musicians' personalities and examines eight personality trends of high school band, orchestra, and choir studentsâ¦\n\nTheme-period, as the basic compositional form during the first movement of Isak Shehu`s Symphony âIllyriansâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFatos Lumani\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The traditional doctrine of musical forms has its sentence, phrase, period and punctuation. Questions, exclamations, subordinate clauses are everywhere, voices rise and fall, and, in all of this, the gesture of music is borrowed from the speaking voiceâ (Adorno, Gillespie, 1993. Based on the quote of Adorno (1993, we will analyze this paper with the purpose of answering a few questions concerning the already designated thesis âThe theme â Period, a fundamental compositional form in the first movement of the symphony by Cesk Zadejaâ, talking through the period from different perspectives as follows: The complex sentence and the period in music; The initial forms of the period in music; The period in classicism/the period and the folk melodies in the classical symphonies; Theme-period, as the basic compositional form during the first movement of Isak Shehu`s Symphony. As an introduction we would like to refer to some studies/lectures that relate to language with music, such as: âThe Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvardâ(Bernstein, 1981 where Bernstein in his opening fi rst lecture clarified the significance of âthe interdisciplinary strategy by saying that â...the best way to âknowâ a thing is in the context of another disciplineâ. Within these six lectures, Bernstein explains his ideas regarding the universality of music drawing analogies to other disciplines such as linguistics, philosophy, aesthetics, acoustics and history of music. As the primary interdisciplinary subject, Bernstein chose the recent work of Noam Chomsky on linguistic theories about âLanguage and Mindâ. In the first three lectures, Bernstein analyzes the music from a linguistic aspect: phonology (sound, syntax (structure and semantics (meaning, pinpointing the music of the classical period.\n\nNATIONAL FOLK MUSIC TRADITIONS IN TEODOR ZGUREANUâS CONCERTO FOR NAI (ROMANIAN PAN FLUTE AND ORCHESTRA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMUZÃCA TATIANA\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article presents the first musicological analysis of Teodor Zgureanuâs concerto for nai (Romanian pan flute and orchestra. The analysis places the concerto within the context of the neofolkloric and polystylistic tradition. Its main focus is to identify the concertoâs dramatic structure and its main means of expression in relation to the modern compositional techniques.\n\nIntervjuu American Wind Symphony Orchestra dirigendi Robert Austin Boudreau'ga = Interview with Mr. Robert Austin Boudreau, director of the American Wind Symphony Orchestra / Robert Austin Boudreau ; interv.

We have recently proposed a hypothesis that the associations of those disorders are based on interactions of the three organs, i.e. the bone, adipose, and vascular tissues, possibly through multiple actions of several humoral factors and/or transcription factors. We call this unified hypothesis âosteo-lipo-vascular interactionsâ, which may be explained by the common origin of the cells in each organ, such as mesenchymal stem cells or macrophages. Several groups proposed similar hypotheses. On the other hand, there have been accumulating evidences which indicate that there exist hitherto unknown various interactions between many organs, such as hypothalamus-liver, fat-liver, liver-muscle, intestine-pancreas, kidney-heart and so on. Therefore, it seems insufficient to consider only the interactions among several organs, and the standpoint of considering interactions among all organs may be warranted, especially in order to understand the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We here propose a hypothesis that the abnormal interactions of all organs (âOminous Orchestra of Organsâ underlies the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. It is to be elucidated which of the âplayersâ or the âconductorâ may be mainly responsible for disharmony of the orchestra.\n\nPhysics for Mathematicians\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUlam, S. M.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWhen I was asked to give a talk here, being just a mathematician among the distinguished array of physicists invited to speak, I had great hesitation. Then it occurred to me, if Viki Weisskopf can conduct a symphony orchestra, maybe I can talk about physics. I felt consoled until yesterday evening when I discovered that he is a professional, and so I feel very, hesitant again. My title, \"Physics for Mathematicians\", will almost mean physics without mathematics. My interest is really to paraphrase a famous statement, not what mathematics can do for physics, but what physics can do for mathematics. That is the underlying motive...\n\nUranium mining during the Cold War. The Wismut plant in the Soviet atomic complex; Uranbergbau im Kalten Krieg. Die Wismut im sowjetischen Atomkomplex. Bd. 1.
