        "text": "HARTFORD WOLF PACK DEFEAT BRIDGEPORT ISLANDERS\n\nBy: Gerry Cantlon, Howlings\n\nBRIDGEPORT, CT – After a rough start, where they showed resiliency, the Hartford Wolf Pack defeated the Bridgeport Islanders in a 5-4 come-from-behind win in a closed-to-the-public opening pre-season game for both teams.\n\nThe Islanders built a 3-0 lead in the game’s first 15 minutes as Jimmy Lambert, the nephew of one-time Bridgeport Sound Tiger and New Haven Nighthawks player Lane Lambert – now the Head Coach of the parent New York Islanders – garnered a goal and two assists. Next, former UCONN star Ruslan Iskhakov popped in a goal and added an assist. Then, top-end prospect William Dufour scored from fellow Memorial Cup-winning teammate Vincent Sevigny, born in Hartford and the son of ex-Wolf Pack Pierre Sevigny.\n\nWolf Pack goalie Olof Lindbom surrendered four goals on 12 shots before being relieved by Dylan Garand as planned halfway through the period.\n\nHARTFORD WOLF PACK COMEBACK BEGINS\n\nPatrick Khordorenko started the comeback with their first goal on the power play, tallying a rebound of Lauri Pajuniemi’s shot that Ken Appleby initially stopped. Then, Tim Theocharidis, skating on a training camp Professional Try-Out (PTO) contract, made it 3-2 off a crazy bounce that came off the backboards.\n\nThe Pack’s Alex Whelan scored an opportunistic goal into an open cage on the side of the net front pass from rookie Ryder Korczak to even then score.\n\nThe Islanders regained the lead on a game-rare five-on-five tally when Lambert scored off a Hartford miscue.\n\nPajuniemi registered his second contest point on the power play early in the third period. He converted on a pass from another rookie, Louka Henault. Then defenseman Blake Hillman, on a PTO for the second straight year, was the hero scoring with 5:10 left in regulation. He whistled his shot past Henrik Tikkanen to give the Pack the 5-4 lead that would be the final score.\n\nThe two teams battle Friday night at Trinity College in Hartford at 6 PM.\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe New York Rangers will likely make their final roster moves mid-week, and in turn, the Wolf Pack will send several down to their ECHL affiliates, the Jacksonville Icemen, for their training camp, which starts next week.\n\nThe Pack received Swedish center Gustav Rydahl yesterday. He played last year for FÃ¤rjestad BK (Sweden-SHL), where he registered 30 points in 44 games and earned one assist in four pre-season games with New York.\n\nLate yesterday, last season’s captain, Jonny Brodzinski, was sent to the Wolf Pack, but he must first clear waivers. Other ex-Pack who were late NHL cuts on the waiver wire before heading to their AHL destinations include two to the Providence Bruins, Vinni Lettieri, and Keith Kinkaid. In addition, Jayson Megna was sent from the Colorado Avalanche to the Colorado Eagles, and Lias Andersson headed to the Ontario Reign from the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nBRIDGEPORT ISLANDERS SIGN FIVE\n\nThe Bridgeport Islanders have been active this week as the parent club sent them five players – Andy Andreoff, Cole Bardreau, Dennis Cholowski,Â Arnaud Durandeau, and Parker Wotherspoon. His brother Tyler was sent down by the New Jersey Devils to the Utica Comets. All cleared waivers and were assigned to Bridgeport. They also signed two more players to one-year contracts, defenseman Mike Cornell and ex-Pack and Springfield, MA, area resident Paul Thompson.\n\nHARTFORD WOLF PACK\n\nHOME"
