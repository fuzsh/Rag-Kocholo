The paper focuses on the development of the phase III module, collaborating with seven European countries, including a patient sample of 318 patients. The methodology followed the EORTC guidelines for developing phase III modules. Patients were assessed by questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 with the EORTC Fatigue Module FA15) followed by an interview, asking for their opinions on the difficulty in understanding, on annoyance and on intrusiveness. The phase II FA15 was revised on the basis of qualitative analyses (comments of the patients), quantitative results (descriptive statistics) as well as the multi-item response theory analyses. The three dimensions (physical, emotional and cognitive) of the scale could be confirmed. As a result, EORTC QLQ-FA13 is now available as a valid phase III module measuring cancer-related fatigue in clinical trials and will be psychometrically improved in the upcoming phase IV.

The module EORTC QLQ-FA13 assesses physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects of cancer-related fatigue. The methodology follows the EORTC guidelines for phase IV validation of modules. This paper focuses on the results of the psychometric validation of the factorial structure of the module. For validation and cross-validation confirmatory factor analysis (maximum likelihood estimation), intraclass correlation and Cronbach alpha for internal consistency were employed. The study involved an international multicenter collaboration of 11 European and non-European countries. A total of 946 patients with various tumor diagnoses were enrolled. Based on the confirmatory factor analysis, we could approve the three-dimensional structure of the module. Removing one item and reassigning the factorial mapping of another item resulted in the EORTC QLQ-FA12. For the revised scale, we found evidence supporting good local (indicator reliability â¥ 0.60, factor reliability â¥ 0.82) and global model fit (GFI t1|t2 = 0.965/0.957, CFI t1|t2 = 0.976/0.972, RMSEA t1|t2 = 0.060/0.069) for both measurement points. For each scale, test-retest reliability proved to be very good (intraclass correlation: R t1-t2 = 0.905-0.921) and internal consistency proved to be good to high (Cronbach alpha = .79-.90). Based on the former phase III module, the multidimensional structure was revised as a phase IV module (EORTC FA12) with an improved scale structure. For a comprehensive validation of the EORTC FA12, further aspects of convergent and divergent validity as well as sensitivity to change should be determined. Â© The Author 2017.

A provisional questionnaire with 47 items was administered to patients treated for thyroid cancer within the last 2 years. Patients were interviewed about time and help needed to complete the questionnaire, and whether they found the items understandable, confusing or annoying. Items were kept in the questionnaire if they fulfilled pre-defined criteria: relevant to the patients, easy to understand, not confusing, few missing values, neither floor nor ceiling effects, and high variance. A total of 182 thyroid cancer patients in 15 countries participated ( n â=â115 with papillary, n â=â31 with follicular, n â=â22 with medullary, n â=â6 with anaplastic, and n â=â8 with other types of thyroid cancer). Sixty-six percent of the patients needed 15âmin or less to complete the questionnaire. Of the 47 items, 31 fulfilled the predefined criteria and were kept unchanged, 14 were removed, and 2 were changed. Shoulder dysfunction was mentioned by 5 patients as missing and an item covering this issue was added. To conclude, the EORTC quality of life module for thyroid cancer (EORTC QLQ-THY34) is ready for the final validation phase IV.

A total of 153 patients with breast cancer and 153 normal subjects completed three questionnaires of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-BR23. Multitrait scaling analyses demonstrated that all scales met multidimensional conceptualization criteria in terms of convergence and discrimination validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for five multiple-item scales were greater than 0.70 (range, 0.72-0.91). In known-group comparisons, there were marked group differences between patients differing in disease stage. In breast cancer patients, performance on the questionnaires was in the expected direction for almost all functioning and symptom scores. In addition, comparison between the patient and control groups showed that almost all variables discriminated between patients and normal individuals. In conclusion, the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 was found to be a reliable and valid measure of quality of life in breast cancer patients, indicating that it should be used in clinical and epidemiological cancer research.\n\nValidation of EORTC IN-PATSAT32 for Chinese patients with gastrointestinal cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Jishui; Xie, Shumin; Liu, Jiahao; Sun, Weilin; Guo, Hui; Hu, Yingbin; Gao, Xin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose To test the psychometric properties and applicability of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer In-patient Satisfaction with Care Questionnaire 32 (EORTC IN-PATSAT32) for Chinese patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Patients and methods A total of 106 inpatients with gastrointestinal cancer at Cangzhou Center Hospital were enrolled in this study. All were treated at Cangzhou Center Hospital from July 2013âMarch 2014. All participants self-administered the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire â Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Results The Cronbachâs Î± coefficients were >0.70 for all scales of the EORTC IN-PATSAT32. Multitrait scaling analysis showed that all-item scale correlation coefficients met the standard of convergent validity, while only 50.0% met the standard of discriminant validity. A weak correlation was found between the scales and single items of the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 and EORTC QLQ-C30. Conclusion The EORTC IN-PATSAT32 appears to be a reliable, valid, and acceptable instrument for measuring patient satisfaction among Chinese patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

Patients with head and neck cancer were asked to complete a list of 60 head and neck cancer-specific items comprising the updated EORTC head and neck module and the core questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30. Debriefing interviews were conducted to identify any irrelevant items and confusing or upsetting wording. Interviews were performed with 330 patients from 17 countries, representing different head and neck cancer sites and treatments. Forty-one of the 60 items were retained according to the predefined EORTC criteria for module development, for another 2 items the wording was refined, and 17 items were removed. The preliminary EORTC QLQ-H&N43 can now be used in academic research. Psychometrics will be tested in a larger field study.

Three hundred two cancer inpatients in Tianjin Cancer Institution and Hospital from June 2013 to December 2013 were recruited for this study. All participants self-administered the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 and EORTC quality of life questionnaire-core 30 (QLQ-C30). Psychometric evaluation of the validity, reliability, acceptability, as well as the influence of age, educational level, diagnostic time, and tumor stage on patient satisfaction, was conducted. A favorable internal consistency reliability was confirmed, as the Cronbach's Î± coefficients were >0.80 for all scales in the EORTC IN-PATSAT32, ranging from 0.849 to 0.944. Multi-trait scaling analysis showed that all item-scale correlation coefficients met the standard of convergent validity, and 79.3 % met the standard of discriminant validity. Weak correlations were found between the scales and single items of the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 and EORTC QLQ-C30, proving the validity of EORTC IN-PATSAT32. None of the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 scales were able to discriminate between patients across age categories, while significant influences of educational level on doctors' and nurses' conduct, as well as influences of diagnostic time and tumor stage on nurses' conduct, and information provision scales were discovered. The questionnaire was easily understood with a satisfactory acceptability. The EORTC IN-PATSAT32 appears to be a reliable, valid, and acceptable instrument to use on cancer patients and is appropriate for measuring the patient satisfaction of Chinese patients.\n\nValidation study of the EORTC information questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-INFO25) in Iranian cancer patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsadi-Lari, Mohsen; Ahmadi Pishkuhi, Mahin; Almasi-Hashiani, Amir; Safiri, Saeid; Sepidarkish, Mahdi\n\n2015-07-01\n\nDeveloping a tool for measuring patient's needs is a vital step in the process of cancer treatment and research. In recent years, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) made a questionnaire to measure cancer patients' received information. Since validity and reliability of any instrument should be evaluated in the new environment and culture, the aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 in Iranian cancer patients. One hundred seventy-three patients with different stages of cancer filled questionnaire EORTC QLQ-INFO25, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC IN-PATSAT32. Twenty-five patients answered the questionnaire twice at an interval of 2 weeks. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire was measured by Cronbach's alpha, interclass correlation, test retest, inter-rater agreement (IRA), and exploratory factorial analyses. Using a conservative approach, the IRA for the overall relevancy and clarity of the tool was 87/86% and 83.33%, respectively. Overall appropriateness and clarity were 94.13 and 91.87%, respectively. Overall integrity of the instrument was determined to be 85%. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for all domains and total inventory were top 70 and 90%, respectively. Interclass correlation index ranges between 0.708 and 0.965. Exploratory factorial analyses demonstrate six fields suitable for instrument. Correlation between areas of the questionnaires EORTC QLQ-INFO25 and EORTC in-Patsat32 represents the convergent validity of the questionnaire. Also, results show a standard divergent validity in all domains of the questionnaire (Rho <0.3). Low correlation between the areas of the questionnaires EORTC QLQ-INFO25 and EORTC QLQ-C30 (<0.3) demonstrates the divergence validity of the questionnaire. The results showed that Persian version of the questionnaire EORTC QLQ-INFO25 is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the perception of information in cancer patients.\n\nPsychometric validation of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Endometrial Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-EN24).\n\nPubMed\n\nGreimel, Elfriede; Nordin, Andy; Lanceley, Anne; Creutzberg, Carien L; van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke V; Radisic, Vesna Bjelic; Galalae, Razvan; Schmalz, Claudia; Barlow, Ellen; Jensen, Pernille T; WaldenstrÃ¶m, Ann-Charlotte; Bergmark, Karin; Chie, Wei-Chu; Kuljanic, Karin; Costantini, Anna; Singer, Susanne; Koensgen, Dominique; Menon, Usha; Daghofer, Fedor\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA validation study was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Endometrial Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-EN24). This module was designed to assess disease and treatment specific aspects of the quality of life (QoL) of patients with endometrial cancer. Two hundred and sixty-eight women with endometrial cancer were recruited in different phases of treatment: after pelvic surgery (Group 1); during adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (Group 2); after completion of treatment (Group 3). Patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30, the endometrial cancer module and a short debriefing questionnaire. Multi-trait scaling analyses confirmed the hypothesised scale structure of the QLQ-EN24. Internal consistency reliability was good with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.74 to 0.86 (lymphoedema 0.80, urological symptoms 0.75, gastrointestinal symptoms 0.74, body image problems 0.86 and sexual/vaginal problems 0.86). Convergent and discriminant validity did not show any scaling errors for the subscales. The QLQ-EN24 module discriminated well between clinically different groups of patients. All items exhibited a high completion rate with less than 2% missing values except for the sexuality items (19%). The validation study supports the reliability, the convergent and divergent validity of the EORTC QLQ-EN24. This newly developed QLQ-EN24 module is a useful instrument for the assessment of the QoL in patients treated for endometrial cancer in clinical trials. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the publication of the LC13 in 1994, major advances have occurred in the treatment of lung cancer. Given this, an update of the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was undertaken. The study followed phases I to III of the EORTC Module Development Guidelines. Phase I generated relevant quality-of-life issues using a mix of sources including the involvement of 108 lung cancer patients. Phase II transformed issues into questionnaire items. In an international multicenter study (phase III), patients completed both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the 48-item provisional lung cancer module generated in phases I and II. Patients rated each of the items regarding relevance, comprehensibility, and acceptance. Patient ratings were assessed against a set of prespecified statistical criteria. Descriptive statistics and basic psychometric analyses were carried out. The phase III study enrolled 200 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer from 12 centers in nine countries (Cyprus, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain, Norway, Poland, Taiwan, and the UK). Mean age was 64âyears (39â-â91), 59% of the patients were male, 82% had non-small-cell lung cancer, and 56% were treated with palliative intent. Twenty-nine of the 48 questions met the criteria for inclusion. The resulting module with 29 questions, thus currently named EORTC QLQ-LC29, retained 12 of the 13 original items, supplemented with 17 items that primarily assess treatment side-effects of traditional and newer therapies.

One hundred and eighty-eight patients with primary or secondary brain cancer from Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital during September 2013 to June 2014 completed the Chinese EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 questionnaires developed by translation, back translation and cultural adaptation. Results were statistically analysed using SPSS17.0. The internal consistency (Cronbach's Î± coefficient) was between .753 and .869, the correlation coefficients among items and its own dimension were bigger than .4, and all items had a better correlation with its own dimension. The Spearman was used to analyse the correlation of each dimension between EORTC QLQ-BN20 and EORTC QLQ-C30, and the result showed that individual dimensions were moderately correlated, other dimensions were weakly correlated. In conclusion, the Chinese version of EORTC QLQ BN20 questionnaire had great relevance, reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity. It provides a valuable tool for the assessment of health-related quality of life in clinical studies of Chinese patients with primary or secondary brain cancer.

The aim of this study was to develop a HRQOL questionnaire module to supplement the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30 for older (>70years) patients with cancer. Phases 1-3 were conducted in seven countries following modified EORTC Quality of Life Group guidelines for module development. Phase 1: potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a questionnaire survey of 17 multi-disciplinary health professionals and two rounds of qualitative interviews. The first round included 9 patients aged >70. The second round was a comparative series of interviews with 49 patients >70years with a range of cancer diagnoses and 40 patients aged 50-69years matched for gender and disease site. In Phase 2 the issues were formulated into a long provisional item list. This was administered in Phase 3 together with the QLQ-C30 to two further groups of cancer patients aged >70 (n=97) or 50-69years (n=85) to determine the importance, relevance and acceptability of each item. Redundant and duplicate items were removed; issues specific to the older group were selected for the final questionnaire. In Phase 1, 75 issues were identified. These were reduced in Phase 2 to create a 45 item provisional list. Phase 3 testing of the provisional list led to the selection of 15 items with good range of response, high scores of importance and relevance in the older patients. This resulted in the EORTC QLQ-ELD15, containing five conceptually coherent scales (functional independence, relationships with family and friends, worries about the future, autonomy and burden of illness). The EORTC QLQ-ELD15 in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30 is ready for large-scale validation studies, and will assess HRQOL issues of most relevance and concern for older people with\n\n[Health-related quality of life in the oncology departments of the hospital of Navarra.

The aim was to develop a supplementary module to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) focusing on oral health and related QoL issues in all cancer diagnoses. The module development followed the EORTC guidelines. Phases 1&2 were conducted in France, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom, while seven countries representing seven languages were included in Phase 3. Eighty-five QoL-items were identified from systematic literature searches. Semi-structured interviews with health-care professionals experienced in oncology and oral/dental care (n=18) and patients (n=133) resulted in a provisional module with 41 items. In phase 3 this was further tested in 178 European patients representing different phases of disease and treatment. Results from the interviews, clinical experiences and statistical analyses resulted in the EORTC QLQ-OH17. The module consists of 17 items conceptualised into four multi-item scales (pain/discomfort, xerostomia, eating, information) and three single items related to use of dentures and future worries. This study provides a useful tool intended for use in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 for assessment of oral and dental problems. The increased awareness may lead to proper interventions, thereby preventing more serious problems and negative impact on QoL. The reliability and validity, the cross-cultural applicability and the psychometric properties of the module will be tested in a larger international study. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This report summarises the EORTC translation procedure, recent accomplishments and challenges. Translations follow a forward-backward procedure, independently carried out by two native-speakers of the target language. Discrepancies are arbitrated by a third consultant, and solutions are reached by consensus. Translated questionnaires undergo a pilot-testing. Suggestions are incorporated into the final questionnaire. Requests for translations originate from the module developers, physicians or pharmaceutical industry, and most translations are performed by professional translators. The translation procedure is managed and supervised by a Translation Coordinator within the EORTC QL Unit in Brussels. To date, the EORTC QLQ-C30 has been translated and validated into more than 60 languages, with further translations in progress. Translations include all major Western, and many African and Asian languages. The following translation problems were encountered: lack of expressions for specific symptoms in various languages, the use of old-fashioned language, recent spelling reforms in several European countries and different priorities of social issues between Western and Eastern cultures. The EORTC measurement system is now registered for use in over 9000 clinical trials worldwide. The EORTC provides strong infrastructure and quality control to produce robust translated questionnaires. Nevertheless, translation problems have been identified. The key to improvements may lie in the particular features and strengths of the group, consisting of researchers from 21 countries representing 25 languages and include the development of simple source versions, the use of advanced computerised tools, rigorous pilot-testing, certification procedures and insights from a unique cross\n\nCross-cultural application of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire for elderly patients with cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoo, Ae Jin; Shin, Dong Wook; Yang, Hyung Kook; Park, Jong-Hyock; Kim, So-Young; Shin, Joo Yeon; Kim, Young Ae; Kim, Changhoon; Hong, Nam-Soo; Min, Young Joo; Park, Keeho\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-ELD14 is a validated tool that measures Health-related Quality-of-life (HRQOL) for elderly patients with cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 to determine if this tool can be used to evaluate HRQOL for older Korean patients with cancer. We recruited 439 elderly patients with cancer aged â¥60years from 11 cancer centers and completed the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaires. The reliability and validity of the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire were assessed via Cronbach alpha, multitrait scaling analyses, correlation analyses with the EORTC QLQ-C30, and known-group comparisons. Known-group comparisons were conducted by dividing the patients into groups based on the cancer stage, depression level, and loss of mobility. The scale structure of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 was consistent with the originally hypothesized scale structure. Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged 0.65-0.88. Multitrait scaling analysis showed good item convergent and discriminant validity. Low scaling errors (3.1%) were observed. Divergent validity was demonstrated by no strong correlation with the EORTC QLQ C30. The clinical validity of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 was demonstrated by its ability to discriminate among patient subgroups categorized by AJCC stage, depression level, and loss of mobility. Our findings indicate that the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire is reliable and valid for measuring QOL of older Korean patients with cancer. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study pre-tested the revised EORTC satisfaction with cancer care core questionnaire applicable in both the cancer inpatient and outpatient settings, and its new, outpatient-specific complementary module. The process of revision, development of the extended application, and pre-testing of these questionnaires was based on phases I to III of the \"EORTC Quality of Life Group Module Development Guidelines.\" In phase III, patients in 11 countries in four European regions, South America and Asia completed provisional versions of the questionnaires. Fifty-seven relevant issues selected from literature reviews and input from experts were operationalized into provisional items, and subsequently translated into ten languages. Assessment of understanding, acceptability, redundancy and relevance by patients (nÂ =Â 151) from oncology inpatient wards, and outpatient chemotherapy, radiotherapy and consultation settings, led to retention of, deletion of and merging of 40, 14 and 6 items respectively. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for hypothesized questionnaire scales were above 0.80. Our results provide preliminary support for the 33-item EORTC Satisfaction with cancer care core questionnaire and the 7-item complementary module specific for the outpatient care setting. A large scale phase IV cross-cultural psychometric study is now underway.

The phase III module comprised 17 items with four hypothesized multi-item scales and three single items. In phase IV, patients with mixed cancers, in different treatment phases from 10 countries completed the EORTC QLQ-C30, the QLQ-OH module, and a debriefing interview. The hypothesized structure was tested using combinations of classical test theory and item response theory, following EORTC guidelines. Test-retest assessments and responsiveness to change analysis (RCA) were performed after 2Â weeks. Five hundred seventy-two patients (median age 60.3, 54Â % females) were analyzed. Completion took <10Â min for 84Â %, 40Â % expressed satisfaction that these issues were addressed. Analyses suggested a revision of the phase III hypothesized scale structure. Two items were deleted based on a high degree of item misfit, together with negative patient feedback. The remaining 15 items formed one eight-item scale named OH-QoL score, a two-item information scale, a two-item scale regarding dentures, and three single items (sticky saliva/mouth soreness/sensitivity to food/drink). Face and convergent validity and internal consistency were confirmed. Test-retest reliability (nÂ =Â 60) was demonstrated as was RCA for patients undergoing chemotherapy (nÂ =Â 117; pÂ =Â 0.06). The resulting QLQ-OH15 discriminated between clinically distinct patient groups, e.g., low performance status vs. higher (pÂ <Â 000.1), and head-and-neck cancer versus other cancers (pÂ <Â 0.03). The EORTC module QLQ-OH15 is a short, well-accepted assessment tool focusing on oral problems and QoL to improve clinical management.

Therefore it isÂ is essential to develop patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that capture the full range of issues relevant to disease-free cancer survivors. The objectives of this project are: 1) to develop a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire that captures the full range of physical, mental and social HRQOL issues relevant to disease-free cancer survivors; and 2) to determine at which minimal time since completion of treatment the questionnaire should be used. We reviewed 134 publications on cancer survivorship and interviewed 117 disease-free cancer survivors with 11 different types of cancer across 14 countries in Europe to generate an exhaustive, provisional list of HRQOL issues relevant to cancer survivors. The resulting issue list, the EORTC core questionnaire (QLQ-C30), and site-specific questionnaire modules were completed by a second group of 458 survivors. We identified 116 generic survivorship issues. These issues covered body image, cognitive functioning, health behaviors, negative and positive outlook, health distress, mental health, fatigue, sleep problems, physical functioning, pain, several physical symptoms, social functioning, and sexual problems. Patients rated most of the acute symptoms of cancer and its treatment (e.g. nausea) as no longer relevant approximately one year after completion of treatment. Compared to existing cancer survivorship questionnaires, our findings underscore the relevance of assessing issues related to chronic physical side effects of treatment such as neuropathy and joint pain. We will further develop a core survivorship questionnaire and three site-specific modules for disease-free adult cancer survivors who are at least one year post-treatment.\n\n[Computer-based quality-of-life monitoring in head and neck cancer patients: a validation model using the EORTC-QLQ C30 and EORTC- H&N35 Portuguese PC-software version].\n\nPubMed\n\nSilveira, Augusta; GonÃ§alves, Joaquim; Sequeira, Teresa; Ribeiro, ClÃ¡udia; Lopes, Carlos; Monteiro, Eurico; Pimentel, Francisco LuÃ­s\n\n2011-12-01\n\nQuality of Life is a distinct and important emerging health focus, guiding practice and research. The routine Quality of Life evaluation in clinical, economic, and epidemiological studies and in medical practice promises a better Quality of Life and improved health resources optimization. The use of information technology and a Knowledge Management System related to Quality of Life assessment is essential to routine clinical evaluation and can define a clinical research methodology that is more efficient and better organized. In this paper, a Validation Model using the Quality of Life informatics platform is presented. Portuguese PC-software using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ C30 and EORTC-H&N35), is compared with the original paper-pen approach in the Quality of Life monitoring of head and neck cancer patients. The Quality of Life informatics platform was designed specifically for this study with a simple and intuitive interface that ensures confidentiality while providing Quality of Life evaluation for all cancer patients. For the Validation Model, the sample selection was random. Fifty-four head and neck cancer patients completed 216 questionnaires (108 using the informatics platform and 108 using the original paper-pen approach) with a one-hour interval in between. Patient preferences and computer experience were registered. Quality of Life informatics platform showed high usability as a user-friendly tool. This informatics platform allows data collection by auto-reply, database construction, and statistical data analysis and also facilitates the automatic listing of the questionnaires. When comparing the approaches (Wilcoxon test by item, percentile distribution and Cronbach's alpha), most of the responses were similar. Most of the patients (53.6%) reported a preference for the software version. The Quality of Life informatics platform has revealed to be a powerful and effective tool, allowing a real time\n\nQuality of life in head and neck cancer patients after surgical resection: translation into Cantonese and validation of the EORTC QLQ-H&N35.\n\nPubMed\n\nBower, W F; Vlantis, A C; Chung, T M L; Cheung, S K C; Bjordal, K; van Hasselt, C A\n\n2009-07-01\n\nHigh convergent and discriminant validity between subscales was achieved after the translation of EORTC QLQ-H&N35 into Cantonese. Most subscales were assessing distinct components of quality of life (QoL). The study aimed to translate the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 cancer module into Cantonese and to confirm validity and reliability for use in a Hong Kong head and neck (H&N) cancer population. An ethnocentric forward-backward translation of EORTC QLQ-H&N35 was conducted by bilingual head and neck health professionals. Discrepancies were identified and problematic wording and concepts revised. Further review preceded pilot testing in 119 postoperative H&N cancer patients. Internal consistency within each subscale, convergent and discriminant validity to check the item relevance and item representativeness within and between subscales were examined. Mean and standard deviations of each subscale and single item and Cronbach's alpha coefficients for subscales were calculated. Six of seven subscales achieved standard reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient >0.7). Correlation coefficients between an item and its own subscale were significantly higher than the coefficients with other subscales. Scaling success was found in all subscales. Pearson's correlation coefficient between subscales was <0.70, except between the subscales swallowing and trouble with social eating (r = 0.795), and speech problems and social contact (r = 0.754).\n\nThe EORTC information questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-INFO25. Validation study for Spanish patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nArraras, Juan Ignacio; Manterola, Ana; HernÃ¡ndez, Berta; Arias de la Vega, Fernando; MartÃ­nez, Maite; Vila, Meritxell; Eito, Clara; Vera, Ruth; DomÃ­nguez, Miguel Ãngel\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe EORTC QLQ-INFO25 evaluates the information received by cancer patients. This study assesses the psychometric properties of the QLQ-INFO25 when applied to a sample of Spanish patients. A total of 169 patients with different cancers and stages of disease completed the EORTC QLQINFO25, the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the information scales of the inpatient satisfaction module EORTC IN-PATSAT32 on two occasions during the patients' treatment and follow- up period. Psychometric evaluation of the structure, reliability, validity and responsiveness to changes was conducted. Patient acceptability was assessed with a debriefing questionnaire. Multi-trait scaling confirmed the 4 multi-item scales (information about disease, medical tests, treatment and other services) and eight single items. All items met the standards for convergent validity and all except one met the standards of item discriminant validity. Internal consistency for all scales (Î±>0.70) and the whole questionnaire (Î±>0.90) was adequate in the three measurements, except information about the disease (0.67) and other services (0.68) in the first measurement, as was test-retest reliability (intraclass correlations >0.70). Correlations with related areas of IN-PATSAT32 (r>0.40) supported convergent validity. Divergent validity was confirmed through low correlations with EORTC QLQ-C30 scales (r<0.30). The EORTC QLQ-INFO-25 discriminated among groups based on gender, age, education, levels of anxiety and depression, treatment line, wish for information and satisfaction. One scale and an item showed changes over time. The EORTC QLQ-INFO 25 is a reliable and valid instrument when applied to a sample of Spanish cancer patients. These results are in line with those of the EORTC validation study.\n\nQuality assurance in head and neck surgical oncology: EORTC 24954 trial on larynx preservation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeemans, C R; Tijink, B M; Langendijk, J A; Andry, G; Hamoir, M; Lefebvre, J L\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe Head and Neck Cancer Group (HNCG) of the EORTC conducted a quality assurance program in the EORTC 24954 trial on larynx preservation. In this multicentre study, patients with resectable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx were randomly assigned for treatment with sequential or alternating chemoradiation. The need for a quality assurance program is the evaluation and prevention of differences in treatments between centres in this multidisciplinary study. The surgical subcommittee of the HNCG prepared a questionnaire, and clinical records of all patients were verified during audits of independent teams. Data relating institutional practices were collected during a face to face interview with members of the local team. 271 clinical records from the nine main contributing centres were reviewed. The main difference between centres was the time interval between first consultation and treatment initiation, with a mean of 45 days. On the pathology report the nodal involvement was described by level in 36% of the cases according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery classification. Extranodal spread was not always described in neck dissection specimens. The EORTC 24954 trial on larynx preservation was the first prospective trial with a quality assurance program in head and neck surgical oncology. The analysis shows similarities in practices, but also points out some important differences between centres. Operation reports were fairly complete, but uniformity in pathology reports should be improved. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 172 patients who underwent curative radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy were asked to complete the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR25 questionnaires 3 times (before and 3 and 6 months after RP). Psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire was conducted. Multitrait scaling analysis showed satisfactory construct validity in most scales except for bowel symptoms and hormonal treatment-related symptoms. Internal consistency tested by Cronbach's Î± coefficient met the 0.70 criterion for the urinary symptom, sexual activity and sexual functioning scales at the all 3 time points. Known-group comparison analyses showed better quality-of-life (QOL) scores in patients with higher performance status, and higher hormonal treatment-related symptom scores in patients on hormonal treatment. Responsiveness to changes was in line with clinical implications over time after RP. Our results show that the EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaire has adequate levels in cross-cultural validity. The Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-PR25 is a generally reliable and robust instrument for the assessment of various QOL aspects that can be self-administered to Korean PC patients undergoing RP.

We performed a prospective analysis of HRQOL in patients â¥80 years undergoing radiotherapy with the newly validated elderly-specific HRQOL module EORTC QLQ-ELD14. We prospectively assessed HRQOL in nâ=â50 radiotherapy patients â¥80 years (32% lung, 20% gastrointestinal, 8% each of breast, head and neck, gynecologic cancer) at the start (t1), end (t2), and 6 months after (t3) radiotherapy, using EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-ELD14. Overall survival was determined in the whole cohort and subgroups. Median overall survival from the start of radiotherapy was 15 months; 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 57.1 and 31.0%, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <2, Charlson comorbidity index â¤6, curative treatment intention, local tumor stage Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC I, II), and total dose >45 Gy were associated with prolonged survival. No significant changes in any HRQOL domain were observed during the course of treatment (t1 to t2). Six months after radiotherapy (t3), a significant and clinically relevant deterioration of HRQOL was seen in EORTC QLQ-C30 for physical function and role function and in EORTC QLQ-ELD14 for future worries, burden of illness, and family support. In radiotherapy patients â¥80 years, HRQOL was maintained until the end of radiotherapy but deteriorated in general and elderly-specific areas thereafter, suggesting a need to develop specific supportive interventions for this age group.\n\nCross-cultural development of a quality-of-life measure for patients with melanoma: phase 3 testing of an EORTC Melanoma Module.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinstanley, Julie B; Young, Teresa E; Boyle, Frances M; Bergenmar, Mia; Bottomley, Andrew; Burmeister, Bryan; Campana, Luca G; Garioch, Jennifer J; King, Madeleine; Nikolic, Dejan V; van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke V; Saw, Robyn; Thompson, John F; White, Edward G\n\n2015-02-01\n\nMelanoma is an increasingly common skin cancer worldwide. Recent treatment advances have provided patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) with choices where quality of life (QoL) and toxicity are important considerations. A melanoma-specific QoL questionnaire is being developed in a cross-cultural setting using a four phase process developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group. In phase 1, a literature search identified a list of pertinent QoL issues; this was shown to HCPs and patients in eight countries and rated for importance and relevance. Questions were constructed for the highest-rated issues (phase 2) and piloted in another patient sample (phase 3). Using EORTC Quality of Life Group criteria and sequential use of factor and Rasch analysis, scales were hypothesized for field testing (phase 4). Seven QoL domains (disease symptoms, treatment issues, financial issues, access/quality of information, satisfaction with care, psychosocial issues and support), comprising 73 QoL issues, were rated by 46 HCPs and 78 patients. Fifty-six issues were rephrased as questions and piloted with 132 patients. A 38-item questionnaire (QLQ-MEL38) is available for field testing in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30. This study has shown that melanoma patients have important QoL issues that have been incorporated into a new cross-culturally validated instrument. Future testing of this EORTC module is planned and will be an important step forward in providing reliable QoL data to aid future decision-making in the management and clinical trials of this complex group of patients.\n\nThe EORTC CAT Core-The computer adaptive version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetersen, Morten Aa; Aaronson, Neil K; Arraras, Juan I; Chie, Wei-Chu; Conroy, Thierry; Costantini, Anna; Dirven, Linda; Fayers, Peter; Gamper, Eva-Maria; Giesinger, Johannes M; Habets, Esther J J; Hammerlid, Eva; Helbostad, Jorunn; Hjermstad, Marianne J; Holzner, Bernhard; Johnson, Colin; Kemmler, Georg; King, Madeleine T; Kaasa, Stein; Loge, Jon H; Reijneveld, Jaap C; Singer, Susanne; Taphoorn, Martin J B; Thamsborg, Lise H; Tomaszewski, Krzysztof A; Velikova, Galina; Verdonck-de Leeuw, Irma M; Young, Teresa; Groenvold, Mogens\n\n2018-06-21\n\nTo optimise measurement precision, relevance to patients and flexibility, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) should ideally be adapted to the individual patient/study while retaining direct comparability of scores across patients/studies. This is achievable using item banks and computerised adaptive tests (CATs). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) is one of the most widely used PROMs in cancer research and clinical practice. Here we provide an overview of the research program to develop CAT versions of the QLQ-C30's 14 functional and symptom domains. The EORTC Quality of Life Group's strategy for developing CAT item banks consists of: literature search to identify potential candidate items; formulation of new items compatible with the QLQ-C30 item style; expert evaluations and patient interviews; field-testing and psychometric analyses, including factor analysis, item response theory calibrationÂ and simulation of measurement properties. In addition, software for setting up, runningÂ and scoring CAT has been developed. Across eight rounds of data collections, 9782 patients were recruited from 12 countries for the field-testing. The four phases of development resulted in a total of 260 unique items across the 14 domains. Each item bank consists of 7-34 items. Psychometric evaluations indicated higher measurement precision and increased statistical power of the CAT measures compared to the QLQ-C30 scales. Using CAT, sample size requirements may be reduced by approximately 20-35% on average without loss of power. The EORTC CAT Core represents a more precise, powerful and flexible measurement system than the QLQ-C30. It is currently being validated in a large independent, international sample of cancer patients. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, the successful implementation of PROs is still a major challenge, although common barriers to and facilitators of their beneficial use are well known. To support health care professionals and other stakeholders in the implementation of the EORTC PRO measures, the EORTC Quality of Life GroupÂ provides guidance on issues considered important for their use in daily clinical practice. Herein, we present an outline of the newly developed \"'Manual for the use of EORTC measures in daily clinical practice\", covering the following issues: * a rationale for using EORTC measures in routine care *selection of EORTC measures, timing of assessments, scoring and presentation of results * aspects of a strategic implementation * electronic data assessment and telemonitoring, and * further use of EORTC measures and ethical considerations. Next to an extensive overview of currently available literature, the manual specifically focuses on knowledge about EORTC measures to give evidence-based recommendations whenever possible and to encourage readers and end-users of EORTC measures to contribute to further needed high-quality research. The manual will be accessible on the EORTC Quality of Life Group website's homepage and will be periodically updated to take into account any new knowledge due to medical, technical, regulatory and scientific advances.

The EORTC QLQ-CX24 and the core questionnaire (the EORTC QLQ-C30) were administered to 860 Korean disease-free survivors of cervical cancer and 494 female control subjects from the general Korean population. The construct reliability and validity of the EORTC QLQ-CX24 questionnaire were assessed via factor analysis, multitrait scaling analyses and known group comparisons. Factor structure of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-CX24 questionnaire agreed with the originally hypothesized scale structure. Scale reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha coefficients for internal consistency, which ranged from 0.78 to 0.87. Convergent and discriminant validity was confirmed by multitrait scaling analysis, which revealed scaling errors of 0.9. The clinical validity of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-CX24 was demonstrated by the ability to discriminate among controls and patient subgroups of different stages, treatments and overall health status. The Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-CX24 was found to be a reliable and a valid measure of quality of life among survivors of cervical cancer when administered in a large survey setting.

As currently systematic palliative treatment only has a limited effect on survival rates, the concept of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is gaining more and more importance in the therapy setting of metastatic breast cancer. One of the major patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for measuring HRQoL in patients with breast cancer is provided by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Currently, paper-based surveys still predominate, as only a few reliable and validated electronic-based questionnaires are available. Facing the possibilities associated with evolving digitalization in medicine, validation of electronic versions of well-established PRO is essential in order to contribute to comprehensive and holistic oncological care and to ensure high quality in cancer research. The aim of this study was to analyze the reliability of a tablet-based measuring application for EORTC QLQ-C30 in German language in patients with adjuvant and (curative) metastatic breast cancer. Paper- and tablet-based questionnaires were completed by a total of 106 female patients with adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer recruited as part of the e-PROCOM study. All patients were required to complete the electronic- (e-PRO) and paper-based versions of the HRQoL EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. A frequency analysis was performed to determine descriptive sociodemographic characteristics. Both dimensions of reliability (parallel forms reliability [Wilcoxon test] and test of internal consistency [Spearman rho and agreement rates for single items, Pearson correlation and Kendall tau for each scale]) were analyzed. High correlations were shown for both dimensions of reliability (parallel forms reliability and internal consistency) in the patient's response behavior between paper- and electronic-based questionnaires.

Patients with advanced cancer from six countries completed the QLQ-C15-PAL at consultation and at one follow-up point. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictive value of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL functional/symptom scores for global QOL (question 15). Three hundred forty-nine patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL at baseline. In the total patient sample, worse emotional functioning, pain, and appetite loss were the most significant predictive factors for worse QOL. In the subgroup of patients with bone metastases (nâ=â240), the domains mentioned above were also the most significant predictors, whereas in patients with brain metastases (nâ=â109), worse physical and emotional functioning most significantly predicted worse QOL. One-month follow-up in 267 patients revealed that the significant predictors changed somewhat over time. For example, in the total patient sample, physical functioning, fatigue, and appetite loss were significant predictors at the follow-up point. A sub-analysis of predictive factors affecting QOL by primary cancer (lung, breast, and prostate) was also conducted for the total patient sample. Deterioration of certain EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL functional/symptom scores significantly contributes to worse overall QOL. Special attention should be directed to managing factors most influential on overall QOL to ensure optimal management of advanced cancer patients.\n\nFurther evaluation of the EORTC QLQ-C30 psychometric properties in a large Brazilian cancer patient cohort as a function of their educational status.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaiva, Carlos Eduardo; Carneseca, Estela Cristina; Barroso, Eliane MarÃ§on; de Camargos, Mayara Goulart; Alfano, Ana Camila Callado; Rugno, Fernanda Capella; Paiva, Bianca Sakamoto Ribeiro\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is considered a valid instrument for use in Brazil.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in a sample of cancer patients at different educational levels who completed the instrument administered by an interviewer. Data from six prospective studies conducted by the same group of researchers were combined in this study (N = 986). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, all values of which were >0.7, with the exception of cognitive functioning, social functioning, and nausea and vomiting (Î± = 0.57, Î± = 0.69, and Î± = 0.68, respectively). In multi-trait scaling analysis, convergent and divergent validity were considered adequate (validity indices were 91.6 and 97.4%). In general, moderate to strong correlations were found between the subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its respective dimensions from the WHOQOL-bref, the hospital anxiety and depression scale, and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) instruments. In addition, the EORTC QLQ-C30 was able to differentiate groups of patients with distinct performance statuses and types of treatment (known-group validation). Statistical analyses were also performed on educational status, yielding similar results. Detailed psychometric property data using the EORTC QLQ-C30 in Brazil are added by this study. In addition, we demonstrated that this instrument is in general reliable and valid regardless of the patient educational level.\n\nHealth-related quality of life questionnaires in lung cancer trials: a systematic literature review\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths. Treatment goals are the relief of symptoms and the increase of overall survival. With the rising number of treatment alternatives, the need for comparable assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) parameters grows. The aim of this paper was to identify and describe measurement instruments applied in lung cancer patients under drug therapy. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review at the beginning of 2011 using the electronic database Pubmed. Results A total of 43 studies were included in the review. About 17 different measurement instruments were identified, including 5 generic, 5 cancer-specific, 4 lung cancer-specific and 3 symptom-specific questionnaires. In 29 studies at least 2 instruments were used. In most cases these were cancer and lung cancer-specific ones. The most frequently used instruments are the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer modules LC13 or LC17. Only 5 studies combined (lung) cancer-specific questionnaires with generic instruments. Conclusions The EORTC-C30 and EORTC-LC13 are the most frequently used health-related quality of life measurement instruments in pharmacological lung cancer trials.

The QOL-OC was developed and modified using the international definition of quality of life (QOL) promulgated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and analysis of the precedent measuring instruments. The contents of each item were determined in the context of the specific characteristics of oral cancer. Two hundred thirteen oral cancer patients were asked to complete both the EORTC core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLC-C30) and the QOL-OC. Data collected was used to conduct factor analysis, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity. Questionnaire compliance was relatively high. Fourteen of the 213 subjects accepted the same tests after 24 to 48Â h demonstrating a high test-retest reliability for all five scales. Overall internal consistency surpasses 0.8. The outcome of the factor analysis coincides substantially with our theoretical conception. Each item shows a higher correlation coefficient within its own scale than the others which indicates high construct validity. QOL-OC demonstrates fairly good statistical reliability, validity, and feasibility. However, further tests and modification are needed to ensure its applicability to the quality-of-life assessment of Chinese oral cancer patients.\n\nHealth-related Quality of Life as Studied by EORTC QLQ and Voice Handicap Index Among Various Patients With Laryngeal Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarlsen, Tom; Sandvik, Lorentz; Heimdal, John-Helge; Hjermstad, Marianne Jensen; Aarstad, Anne Kari Hersvik; Aarstad, Hans JÃ¸rgen\n\n2017-03-01\n\nPatients with voice-related disorders are often treated by a multidisciplinary team including assessment by patient-reported outcome measures. The present paper aims at documenting the importance of including general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures to clinical investigations. The participants (Nâ=â80 larynx cancer, Nâ=â32 recurrent palsy, Nâ=â23 dysfunctional, Nâ=â75 degenerative/inflammation, Nâ=â19 various) were included consecutively at the laryngology clinic at Haukeland University Hospital. In addition, HRQoL data were included from one national group with laryngectomies (Nâ=â105), one group with various patients formerly treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Nâ=â96), and one population-based reference group (Nâ=â1956). Obtained were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ), the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) neuroticism scores. By analysis of variance, we have determined significant dependence of groups analyzing the sum global QoL/health index (Fâ=â9.47; Pâ<0.001), the functional HRQoL sum score (F 5,2373 â=â7.14, Pâ<0.001), and the symptom sum HRQoL scores (F 7,2381 â=â8.13; Pâ<0.001). In particular, patients with recurrent palsy and laryngeal cancer had lowered HRQoL. At the index levels, in particular dyspnea scores, were scored depending on larynx disease group (F 7,2288 â=â24.4; Pâ<0.001). The VHI score correlated with the EORTC H&N35 \"speech\" index with a common variance of 52%. VHI scores correlated with level of neuroticism with 8% common variance (Pâ<0.001) and EORTC scores with 22% (Pâ<0.001). In particular, among patients with voice-related disease, those with recurrent palsy and laryngeal cancer had lower HRQoL. Furthermore, the HRQoL and VHI scores were inversely tied to neuroticism.

This study would assess the reliability of the Arabic translated version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-INFO 25). The study was also designed to quantify DOI to Lebanese cancer patients and determine patient satisfaction with this DOI. Moreover, we compared the differences in the level of information among groups based on clinical and biographical variables. A sample of patients, being treated for a variety of malignancies, was prospectively evaluated. A physician interviewed patients using the Arabic version of the EORTC QLQ-INFO 25, on the day of hospitalization for chemotherapy, before treatment was administered. In total 201 patients were interviewed. The translated version of the EORTC QLQ-INFO 25 showed high reliability when assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficients for internal consistency with values scoring higher than 0.7 for all scales and the full questionnaire. There was a considerable lack of information provided to the participants with 38.8Â % being unaware of their diagnosis and more than half being uninformed about the extent of their disease. Paradoxically, 86.5Â % of patients expressed their satisfaction about the amount of information they received and 89.5Â % believe the information provided was helpful. Further analysis showed no significant association between gender, marital status, cancer site and stage and the amount of information received. However, age and level of education were associated with DOI such as younger and more educated patients received more information. Older patients were also found to be the most satisfied with the information they received, despite having less access to information\n\nAn international phase 3 trial in head and neck cancer: quality of life and symptom results: EORTC 24954 on behalf of the EORTC Head and Neck and the EORTC Radiation Oncology Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nBottomley, Andrew; Tridello, Gloria; Coens, Corneel; Rolland, Frederic; Tesselaar, Margot E T; Leemans, C Rene; Hupperets, Pierre; Licitra, Lisa; Vermorken, Jan B; Van Den Weyngaert, Danielle; Truc, Gilles; Barillot, Isabelle; Lefebvre, Jean-Louis\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 24954 phase 3 randomized clinical trial compared 2 schemes of combined chemotherapy for patients with resectable cancers of the hypopharynx and larynx: sequential induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus alternating chemoradiotherapy. The current study reports detailed effects of both treatment arms on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms. A total of 450 patients aged 35 years to 76 years (World Health Organization performance status (WHO PS) â¤â2) with untreated, resectable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (tumor classification of T3-T4) or hypopharynx (tumor classification of T2-T3-T4) with regional lymph nodes in the neck classified as N0 to N2 with no metastases were randomized in this prospective phase 3 trial into either the sequential arm (control) or the alternating arm (experimental). QOL assessment was performed at randomization; at baseline; at 42 days; and at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. There were no observed differences with regard to the primary endpoint of Fatigue and secondary endpoint of Dyspnea. Significant differences were found in the secondary endpoints of Swallowing and Speech problems at 42 days after randomization in favor of patients in the sequential arm. Explanatory and sensitivity analysis revealed that the primary analysis favored the sequential arm, but the majority of differences in HRQOL did not exist at the end of treatment, and returned to baseline levels. In the current study, a trend toward worse scores was noted in the patients treated on the alternating chemoradiotherapy arm but very few differences reached the level of statistical significance. The HRQOL scores of the majority of patients returned to baseline after therapy.

Here we present the results on the field-testing and psychometric evaluation of the item bank for cognitive functioning (CF). In previous phases (I-III), 44 candidate items were developed measuring CF in cancer patients. In phase IV, these items were psychometrically evaluated in a large sample of international cancer patients. This evaluation included an assessment of dimensionality, fit to the item response theory (IRT) model, differential item functioning (DIF), and measurement properties. A total of 1030 cancer patients completed the 44 candidate items on CF. Of these, 34 items could be included in a unidimensional IRT model, showing an acceptable fit. Although several items showed DIF, these had a negligible impact on CF estimation. Measurement precision of the item bank was much higher than the two original QLQ-C30 CF items alone, across the whole continuum. Moreover, CAT measurement may on average reduce study sample sizes with about 35-40% compared to the original QLQ-C30 CF scale, without loss of power. A CF item bank for CAT measurement consisting of 34 items was established, applicable to various cancer patients across countries. This CAT measurement system will facilitate precise and efficient assessment of HRQOL of cancer patients, without loss of comparability of results.\n\nComparison of Quality of Life and Sexuality between Cervical Cancer Survivors and Healthy Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Yumi; Lim, Myong Cheol; Kim, Se Ik; Joo, Jungnam; Lee, Dong Ock; Park, Sang-Yoon\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare quality of life (QoL) and sexual functioning between sexually active cervical cancer survivors and healthy women. In this cross-sectional study, propensity-score-matched cervical cancer survivors (n=104) and healthy women (n=104) were compared. All women had engaged in sexual activity within the previous 3 months, and cervical cancer survivors showed no evidence of disease after primary treatment. QoL and sexual functioning were assessed using three questionnaires; the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Cervical Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-CX24), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Significantly higher scores for lymphedema were observed in the cervical cancer survivors group compared with the healthy women group (mean, 20.2 vs. 12.2; p < 0.05). Sexuality, both in terms of sexual activity, sexual enjoyment, and sexual worry (EORTC QLQ-CX24), and in terms of desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain (FSFI) were similar between the groups. When the scale of sexual/vaginal functioning in EORTC QLQ-CX24 was divided into individual questions, cervical cancer survivors reported shorter vaginal length than the control group, but without statistical significance (mean, 80.6 vs. 85.4; p=0.077). Compared with healthy women, sexuality was not impaired in cervical cancer survivors who showed no evidence of disease after primary treatment and engaging in sexual activity. Further prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm this finding.\n\nPilot-testing the French version of a provisional European organisation for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) measure of spiritual well-being for people receiving palliative care for cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLucette, A; BrÃ©dart, A; Vivat, B; Young, T\n\n2014-03-01\n\nSpiritual well-being is increasingly recognised as an important aspect of patients' quality of life when living with a potentially life-limiting illness such as cancer. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group is developing a measure for assessing spiritual well-being cross-culturally for people receiving palliative care for cancer. The pilot-testing phase of the study explored potential problems related to the content and administration of a provisional version of this measure. The French version was pilot-tested with 12 patients in a palliative and supportive day care unit in Paris. Participants were asked to complete the measure and the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL before being interviewed about their responses. The administration of the measure enabled participants to express the difficulties and existential concerns they experienced. The items were not considered intrusive, despite the sensitive topic of the measure. This article considers difficulties with items pertaining to 'religion' and 'spirituality' in the context of French culture. Overall, this measure appears to enhance holistic care, by providing caregivers with a means of broaching spirituality issues, a topic otherwise difficult to discuss in the context of palliative care.

The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Persian version of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) In-Patsat32, as a recently developed questionnaire to assess cancer patient satisfaction with care and information provided during hospital admission. Complying with EORTC protocols, the Persian version of Inpatsat32 was translated and piloted in a small group of patients, then applied to 380 cancer patients admitted to different oncology wards in Tehran. Validity (convergent, discriminant, and divergent) and reliability of the tool was assessed through using multitrait analysis, factor analysis, intraclass correlations, Chronbach's alpha and test-retest (on a sample of 70 patients). Good acceptance and high sensitivity of the questionnaire with low floor and ceiling effects were recognized, indicating power of the instrument to detect differences between groups with heterogeneous levels of satisfaction. Multitrait scaling analyses supported the convergent validity of the majority of scales (correlation coefficient >0.4) and favorable discriminant validity (item own scale correlation >0.8). There was no correlation between In-patsat32 scales and the EORTC-C30, which measures different concepts, confirming divergent validity of the tool. Internal consistency for all domains was high (Î±>0.70) except for the hospital access score and the test-retest reliability was excellent (r=0.86-0.96). There was a weak responsiveness to change except for nurses technical skills. Principle component analysis confirmed five domains with much improved internal consistency (Î±>0.9). The Persian version of the EORTC-in-patsat32 module is a reliable and valid instrument to measure cancer patient satisfaction with care received during their hospitalization period and can be utilized in\n\nPsychometric Validation of the Malaysian Chinese Version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in Colorectal Cancer Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nMagaji, Bello Arkilla; Moy, Foong Ming; Roslani, April Camilla; Law, Chee Wei; Sagap, Ismail\n\n2015-01-01\n\nColorectal cancer is the second most frequent cancer in Malaysia. We aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Malaysian Chinese version of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire core (QLQ-C30) in patients with colorectal cancer. Translated versions of the QLQ-C30 were obtained from the EORTC. A cross sectional study design was used to obtain data from patients receiving treatment at two teaching hospitals in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Malaysian Chinese version of QLQ-C30 was self-administered in 96 patients while the Karnofsky Performance Scales (KPS) was generated by attending surgeons. Statistical analysis included reliability, convergent, discriminate validity, and known-groups comparisons. Statistical significance was based on p value â¤0.05. The internal consistencies of the Malaysian Chinese version were acceptable [Cronbach's alpha (Î±â¥ 0.70)] in the global health status/overall quality of life (GHS/QOL), functioning scales except cognitive scale (Î±â¤0.32) in all levels of analysis, and social/family functioning scale (Î±=0.63) in patients without a stoma. All questionnaire items fulfilled the criteria for convergent and discriminant validity except question number 5, with correlation with role (r = 0.62) and social/family (r = 0.41) functioning higher than with physical functioning scales (r = 0.34). The test-retest coefficients in the GHS/QOL, functioning scales and in most of the symptoms scales were moderate to high (r = 0.58 to 1.00). Patients with a stoma reported statistically significant lower physical functioning (p=0.015), social/family functioning (p=0.013), and higher constipation (p=0.010) and financial difficulty (p=0.037) compared to patients without stoma. There was no significant difference between patients with high and low KPS scores. Malaysian Chinese version of the QLQ-C30 is a valid and reliable measure of HRQOL in patients with colorectal cancer.\n\nEORTC radiation proctitis-specific quality of life module - pretesting in four European countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalkett, Georgia; Aoun, Samar; Hayne, Dickon; Lund, Jo-Asmund; Gruen, Arne; Villa, Julie; Livi, Lorenzo; Arcangeli, Stefano; Velikova, Galina; Spry, Nigel\n\n2010-11-01\n\nRadiation proctitis is a side effect which can occur after pelvic radiation therapy. Currently available questionnaires do not comprehensively assess the range of problems, nor impact on quality of life associated with proctitis. This article reports on the cultural testing phase of an EORTC module (QLQ-PRT21) developed to assess radiation proctitis specific issues and designed to be used in conjunction with the EORTC core quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30). The previously developed 21-item module, pre-tested in Australia, was translated into Norwegian, German, French and Italian. Patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and module questionnaires towards the end of their radical pelvic radiation treatment to target acute side effects. Patients experiencing chronic proctitis were also surveyed. Patients also participated in structured interviews to determine issues of comprehensibility, coverage and relevance. Results were compared with Australian data. Questionnaires were completed by 64 European patients. The module was found to be relevant and culturally acceptable to participants. Feedback has led to minor translation modifications and the inclusion of two additional questions. This module is ready for Phase IV testing which will consist of large scale field testing with the aim to perform psychometric analysis and finalize a module that will be suitable in the assessment of radiation induced proctitis.

Patients were assessed with the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20, FACT/GOG-Ntx, National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) and World Health Organization criterion of CIPN (WHO-CIPN) from baseline up to 10 assessment points. Internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity and responsiveness of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and FACT/GOG-Ntx were evaluated, respectively. Correlation and regression analysis were used to examine the relationships between these two scales. Internal reliability coefficients for both scales were above 0.80 across all assessment points. Moderate correlations of the two scales were found with WHO-CIPN (r s Â =Â 0.40-0.44; r s Â =Â -0.42 to -0.46, all PÂ <Â 0.05) and NCI-CTCAE (r s Â =Â 0.46-0.57; r s Â =Â -0.44 to -0.55, all PÂ <Â 0.01) at most assessment points. Older patients reported significantly more CIPN symptoms than younger counterparts did (PÂ <Â 0.05). The hypothesized factor structures of both scales were not confirmed (Ï2/dfÂ =Â 3.70-7.01; Ï2/dfÂ =Â 2.14-10.43, all PÂ <Â 0.001). Both scales demonstrated responsiveness with small-to-moderate effect size (rÂ =Â 0.09-0.46, rÂ =Â 0.11-0.35). The two scales were highly correlated and were predicted by all domains of each other at specific assessment points (R 2 Â =Â 0.62-0.87; R 2 Â =Â 0.76-0.85; respectively, all PÂ <Â 0.001). The Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and FACT/GOG-Ntx demonstrated acceptable reliability, validity and responsiveness and was found comparable in measuring CIPN among Chinese cancer patients at specific assessment points\n\nQuality assurance in radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKouloulias, V E\n\n2003-03-01\n\nIn 1999, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), being a European pioneer in the field of cancer research as well as in quality assurance (QA), launched an Emmanuel van der Schueren fellowship for QA in radiotherapy.

Design Systematic review conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015032468). Methods According to the PRISMA guidelines, databases of MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO were systematically searched using the following terms and synonyms: breast cancer, quality of life and Asia. Articles reporting on HRQL using EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-BR23, FACT-G and FACT-B questionnaires in Asian patients with breast cancer were eligible for inclusion. The methodological quality of each article was assessed using the quality assessment scale for cross-sectional studies or the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies. Results Fifty-seven articles were selected for this qualitative synthesis, of which 43 (75%) were cross-sectional and 14 (25%) were longitudinal studies. Over 75 different determinants of HRQL were studied with either the EORTC or FACT questionnaires. Patients with comorbidities, treated with chemotherapy, with less social support and with more unmet needs have poorer HRQL. HRQL improves over time. Discordant results in studies were found in the association of age, marital status, household income, type of surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy and unmet sexuality needs with poor global health status or overall well-being. Conclusions In Asia, patients with breast cancer, in particular those with other comorbidities and those treated with chemotherapy, with less social support and with more unmet needs, have poorer HRQL. Appropriate social support and meeting the needs of patients may improve patientsâ HRQL.

We compare three shortened QoL questionnaires in regards to their characteristics, validity, and reliability. A literature search was conducted to identify studies that employed or discussed three abridged QoL questionnaires: the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 15-Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General-7 (FACT-G7), and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care-14 (FACIT-PAL-14). Articles that discussed questionnaire length, intended use, scoring procedure, and validation were included. The 7-item FACT-G7 is the shortest instrument, whereas the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL and the FACIT-PAL-14 contain 14 and 15 items, respectively. All three questionnaires have similar recall period, item organization, and subscale components. Designed as core questionnaires, all three maintain content and concurrent validity of their unabridged original questionnaires. Both the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL and the FACT-G7 demonstrate good internal consistency and reliability, with Cronbach's Î± â¥0.7 deemed acceptable. The developmental study for the FACIT-PAL-14 was published in 2013 and subsequent validation studies are not yet available. The EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL and the FACT-G7 were found to be reliable and appropriate for assessing health-related QoL issues-the former for palliative cancer patients and the latter for advanced cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Conceptually, the FACIT-PAL-14 holds promise to cover social and emotional support issues that are not completely addressed by the other two questionnaires; however, further validation is needed.\n\nQuality of life of early stage colorectal cancer patients in Morocco.\n\nPubMed\n\nMrabti, Hind; Amziren, Mounia; ElGhissassi, Ibrahim; Bensouda, Youssef; Berrada, Narjiss; Abahssain, Halima; Boutayeb, Saber; El Fakir, Samira; Nejjari, Chakib; Benider, Abdellatif; Mellas, Nawfel; El Mesbahi, Omar; Bennani, Maria; Bekkali, Rachid; Zidouh, Ahmed; Errihani, Hassan\n\n2016-10-12\n\nA multicentre cohort study was held in Morocco, designed to evaluate the quality of life of cancer patients. The aim of this paper is to report the assessment of the quality of life of early colorectal cancer patients, before and after cancer treatment, to identify other factors which are related to this quality of life. We used the third version of the QLQ-C30 questionnaire of the European organization for Research and treatment of Cancer (EORTC) after a transcultural validation. The Data collection was done at inclusion and then every twelve weeks to achieve one year of follow up. Overall 294 patients presented with early colorectal cancer, the median age was 56Â years (range: 21-88). The male-female sex ratio was 1.17. At inclusion, the global health status was the most affected functional dimension. For symptoms: financial difficulties and fatigue scores were the highest ones. Emotional and social functions were significantly worse in rectal cancer. Most symptoms were more present in rectal cancer. At inclusion, global health status score was significantly worse in stage III. Anorexia was significantly more important among colorectal female patients. For Patients over 70Â years-old, the difference was statistically significant for the physical function item which was lower. Overall, Functional dimensions scores were improved after chemotherapy. The symptoms scores did not differ significantly for patients treated by radiotherapy, between inclusion and at one year. Our EORTC QLQ C30 scores are overall comparable to the reference values. Neither chemotherapy, nor radiotherapy worsened the quality of life at one year.\n\nSymptoms and health-related quality of life in patients with advanced cancer - A population-based study in Greenland.\n\nPubMed\n\nAugustussen, Mikaela; SjÃ¸gren, Per; Timm, Helle; Hounsgaard, Lise; Pedersen, Michael Lynge\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe aims were to describe symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Greenlandic patients with advanced cancer and to assess the applicability and internal consistency of the Greenlandic version of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 core version 3.0. A Greenlandic version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 v.3.0 was developed. The translation process included independent forward translation, reconciliation and independent back translation by native Greenlandic-speaking translators who were fluent in English. After pilot testing, a population-based cross-sectional study of patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative treatment was conducted. Internal consistency was examined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients for five function scales and three symptom scales. Of the 58 patients who participated in the study, 47% had reduced social functioning, 36% had reduced physical and role functioning and 19% had reduced emotional and cognitive functioning. Furthermore, 48% reported fatigue, and 33% reported financial problems. The Greenlandic version of the EORTC had good applicability in the assessment of symptoms and quality of life. Acceptable Cronbach's alpha coefficients (above 0.70) were observed for the physical, role and social functioning scales, the fatigue scale and the global health status scale. Patients with undergoing palliative treatment in Greenland for advanced cancer reported high levels of social and financial problems and reduced physical functioning. This indicates a potential for improving palliative care service and increasing the focus on symptom management. The Greenlandic version of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 represents an applicable and reliable tool to describe symptoms and health-related quality of life among Greenlandic patients with advanced cancer.

We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL to determine if this tool can be used to evaluate Korean patients with cancer who receive palliative care. A multicenter, cross-sectional survey was performed in palliative care units and hospices in Korea from September to October 2009. A total of 102 patients with cancer completed the questionnaires that included the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL. The compliance rate was high, with the missing rate for each item ranging from 0% to 7.8% (mean 3.1%). A multitrait scaling analysis revealed good convergent and discriminant validity, with only three scaling errors. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.65 to 0.89. The questionnaire discriminated among patient subgroups with different clinical profiles (e.g., performance status and degree of oral intake), thereby demonstrating the clinical validity of this tool. Our findings indicate that the Korean version of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL is a reliable and valid instrument with regard to its psychometric properties. This tool is suitable for measuring quality of life, particularly with regard to physical aspects, in Korean cancer patients who receive palliative care.
