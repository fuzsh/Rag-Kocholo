        "text": "Swedish professional ice hockey centre (born 1994)\n\nIce hockey player\n\nGustav Rydahl (born September 11, 1994) is a Swedish professional ice hockey centre for Frölunda HC of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL).\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nRydahl played in the youth ranks with Färjestads BK before moving to Frölunda HC in 2011. He made his Elitserien debut on October 9, 2012, at Timrå IK.[1] He scored his first Elitserien goal on January 12, 2013, against HV71's Gustaf Wesslau in a 3–4 shootout loss in Scandinavium.[2]\n\nRydahl signed with the Växjö Lakers in 2014 and helped the team win the Swedish championship his first year, making 62 SHL appearances with five goals that season. After two years with the Lakers, he agreed to terms with fellow SHL outfit Luleå HF in May 2016.[3]\n\nHaving claimed the Swedish championship with Färjestad BK in the 2021–22 season, Rydahl left the SHL as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, $750,000 contract with the New York Rangers of the NHL on June 13, 2022.[4][5]\n\nRydahl started the 2022–23 season with the Rangers' American Hockey League affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, but was called up to the Rangers on January 5, 2023.[6][7] He did not play in the Rangers' January 5 game and was returned to Hartford afterward.[8] Rydahl contributed with seven goals and 15 points through 40 games with the Wolf Pack before he was traded by the Rangers to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for forward Anton Blidh on March 3.[9][10] Acquired to add center depth for the Avalanche affiliate, the Colorado Eagles, Rydahl played out the remainder of his contract in the AHL, posting 2 goals in 12 regular season games before appearing in 3 playoff contests with the Eagles.\n\nAs a pending free agent from the Avalanche, Rydahl opted to resume his career in his homeland, signing a five-year contract with his original SHL club, Frölunda HC, on 11 May 2023.[11]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 2009–10 Färjestad BK J18 6 0 1 1 2 — — — — — 2009–10 Färjestad BK J18 Allsv 12 0 2 2 0 7 0 0 0 0 2010–11 Färjestad BK J18 19 8 9 17 26 — — — — — 2010–11 Färjestad BK J18 Allsv 18 2 5 7 18 — — — — — 2010–11 Skåre BK SWE.3 4 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 2011–12 Frölunda HC J18 Allsv 3 1 1 2 0 4 3 2 5 4 2011–12 Frölunda HC J20 46 8 21 29 50 1 0 0 0 0 2012–13 Frölunda HC J20 19 4 8 12 51 3 0 1 1 6 2012–13 Frölunda HC SEL 31 1 1 2 10 5 0 0 0 10 2013–14 Frölunda HC J20 1 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 1 0 2013–14 Frölunda HC SHL 22 1 0 1 14 — — — — — 2013–14 Mora IK Allsv 23 4 2 6 28 6 0 0 0 4 2014–15 Växjö Lakers SHL 44 5 0 5 43 18 0 0 0 0 2015–16 Växjö Lakers SHL 51 7 2 9 10 10 0 1 1 8 2016–17 Luleå HF SHL 25 1 0 1 20 — — — — — 2017–18 Luleå HF SHL 42 1 1 2 39 — — — — — 2017–18 Färjestad BK SHL 7 2 0 2 2 6 0 0 0 8 2018–19 Färjestad BK SHL 47 12 7 19 28 14 2 5 7 4 2019–20 Färjestad BK SHL 49 19 16 35 50 — — — — — 2020–21 Färjestad BK SHL 9 0 2 2 8 6 0 2 2 2 2021–22 Färjestad BK SHL 44 15 15 30 53 19 6 6 12 23 2022–23 Hartford Wolf Pack AHL 40 7 8 15 32 — — — — — 2022–23 Colorado Eagles AHL 12 2 1 3 8 3 1 0 1 4 SHL totals 371 64 44 108 277 78 8 14 22 55\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Event Result GP G A Pts PIM 2011 Sweden IH18 5 0 0 0 4 2022 Sweden OG 4th 5 0 0 0 0 Junior totals 5 0 0 0 4 Senior totals 5 0 0 0 0\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year SHL Le Mat Trophy champion 2015, 2022 [12]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
