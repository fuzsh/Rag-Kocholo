Linköping will not let go of the top scorer Rattie Linköping will sign uninteresting hockey players spiced up with some level hockey players Linköping will tangle between 6-12 placement once the gold team Luleå is releasing Pasic to Leksand or similar.\n\nI don't know how Luleå's table position but Luleå nothing in the SM gold to pick up SM gold even though Silly has not started still, I will rank Luleå low in the SHL table next time.\n\nFrölunda needs the Finn Innala to stay do you think what I think Frölunda brings in a strong physical defenseman from Switzerland and a triple of good scorers to reach the quarter-final places in the top six.\n\nBrynäs, Djurgården, AIK or similar conceivable from Allsvenskan a new team up to SHL in 2024. Brynäs or AIK is the expectation 2024. Västerås, Tingsryd and Djurgården expected top teams 24-25 in Allsvenskan.\n\nAutumn 2024 start the new Swedish hockey season. SHL, Allsvenskan, Hockeyettan, Hockeytvåan, Hockeytrean maybe Hockeyfyran and junior hockey and more young hockey leagues.\n\nWith MIF its same as ever, cant keep star foreigners. Pajaniemi and Kuokkanen are major losses. Time for Lassen to leave. I also want Sjöberg, Sundberg, Sallinen, Viitasalo and Alvarez gone.\n\nJoona Ikonen, Petter Vestheim and Lassi Thomson is rumored in.\n\nHopefully we can get Brandsegg Nygård and Steen aswell. They would get much ice time here. Then lure Solberg here.\n\nMarmelind\n\nWerner\n\nKivihalme - Thompson\n\nGalvas - Solberg\n\nOllas Mattsson - Ryan\n\nIvarsson - Badinka\n\nWahlberg - Händemark - Ikonen\n\nSteen - Vesterheim - Brandseeg Nygård\n\nPersson - Quine - Rosdahl\n\nOlofsson - Forsberg - Paulsen\n\nOlli Jokinen to Timrå, I think this had been rumoured for 6 months.\n\nProbably his NHL audition.\n\nIf he wants to go to the NHL then the AHL or the Canadian junior leagues is the way to go, not the SHL.\n\nIf he wants to go to the NHL then the AHL or the Canadian junior leagues is the way to go, not the SHL.\n\nNo European top leagues coach will go to the jrs to coach kids. And you won't get a lick on an AHL team if you've coached liiga.\n\nNo European top leagues coach will go to the jrs to coach kids. And you won't get a lick on an AHL team if you've coached liiga.\n\nThat's the thing innit?\n\nNHL teams only want coaches from those places, meanwhile coaches in Europe don't want to coach at those places.\n\nFrölunda have a lot of players on contract for next year already. Rumored to join in italic.\n\nLars Johansson\n\nTobias Normann\n\nHenrik Tömmernes - Dominik Egli\n\nFilip Hasa - Tom Nilsson\n\nLinus Högberg - Christian Folin\n\nIsac Heens - Albin Sundin\n\nFilip Cederqvist - David Edstrom - Malte Strömwall\n\nJere Innala - Gustav Rydahl - Max Friberg\n\nOtto Stenberg - Nicklas Lasu - Wiktor Nilsson\n\nLinus Nässén - Noah Hasa - Linus Öberg\n\nIsac Born - Carl Klingberg\n\nNoah Dower Nilsson\n\nGood goaltending, high level defence and a lack of skill up front. As always.\n\nLeaving: Frans Tuohimaa, Pontus Johansson (Skellefteå), Erik Borg (Ilves), Jayden Halbgewachs, Mats Rosseli Olsen, Mikael Ruohomaa, Erik Thorell. Possibly Malte Strömwall as well.\n\nKlingberg have been a big disappointment. I wonder if Anton Blidh wanna come home. That would be a good add.\n\nKlingberg have been a big disappointment. I wonder if Anton Blidh wanna come home. That would be a good add.\n\nPoints wise he's what I expected, but he's way softer than I anticipated. Blidh has another year with the Rangers and he would just be more of the same of what we've already got. A Lasu on the wing."
