        "text": "Fredrik Limsäter, Björn Rydahl and Mattias Lagergren all took the master’s programme in media technology at Linköping University, where Fredrik graduated in 2004, Björn in 2009 and Mattias in 2010. Together they have developed a project-management tool specially designed for the film industry. It delivers improvements, speed, and greater efficiency. They have now received an award for “significant and lasting scientific and technical discoveries and innovations” from the Oscars Academy (AMPAS).\n\n“We have made it possible for both small and large film studios to plan and manage complex digital animations and visual effects efficiently. Our system enables them to focus on creating better content”, says Fredrik Limsäter, founder and CEO of ftrack.\n\nThe films that have been produced with the aid of the system include the Marvel films, Game of Thrones, and the upcoming James Bond film.\n\n“Our system makes collaboration between creators easier. It has been streamlined for industries that create content”, says Björn Rydahl, co-founder of ftrack and responsible for product and technology development.\n\n“We have also broken through previous limits on user-friendliness. The platform is easy to understand and use”, says Mattias Lagergren, the third co-founder of the company and product manager.\n\nAn Oscar: a long-term objective that started with a degree project\n\nThe traditional Oscars are awarded at a gala in April, while the scientific and technical awards were presented using remote methods in February.\n\n“Receiving this recognition from an industry we love is just fantastic”, says Fredrik Limsäter.\n\nTheir journey started just over ten years ago. Fredrik Limsäter had returned to Sweden and Stockholm as part-owner of a film studio. Before this, he had worked on his degree project at a film studio in London, and spent a few years at Sony Pictures in Los Angeles. He noticed that many people in the film industry constructed their own systems for project management, and he started to think about how to create a solution that more people could use, and that also improved the processes.\n\nThe project management system from ftrack delivers better efficiency and more creativity. It now has customers in more than 60 countries. Photo credit Ftrack\n\n“I started to develop ftrack initially for my own studio, together with Björn and Mattias, who were working on their degree projects with me”, says Fredrik Limsäter.\n\nThe degree projects of both of the students dealt with water simulation.\n\n“It involved a lot of maths, with advanced computer graphics. I was simulating water to be used in films”, says Björn Rydahl.\n\n“We were focussed on how to manage water-like effects”, Mattias Lagergren adds, who was also working on simulating hair. But as time went on, they both became increasingly interested in the ftrack system.\n\n“Björn and I have worked very closely together, but in the past three years we’ve taken on slightly different roles. If Björn is the technical product manager, I’m the non-technical one”, laughs Mattias Lagergren.\n\nFtrack grew and became a company in its own right.\n\n“We are now 35 people working in four offices. The head office is in Stockholm, with others in Shanghai, San Francisco and Adelaide, Australia, where we bought out another company in 2019”, says Fredrik Limsäter.\n\nA long wait for good news\n\nThe selection process for this year’s scientific and technical awards started in 2019, when the category was announced."
