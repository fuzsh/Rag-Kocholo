        "text": "Svensk Simidrott, the Swedish swimming federation, has announced a pair of junior rosters for the upcoming European Junior Championships and the Nordic Youth Championships.\n\nThe 2018 European Junior Championships will be held in Helsiniki, Finland from July 4th-8th, and Sweden will send a 17-member team that is fairly-evenly split along gender lines, with 9 females and 8 males. The team is made up of boys born in the years 2000-2003 and girls born in the years 2001-2004.\n\nAmong the included swimmers is Bjorn Seeliger, who is Sweden’s fastest 50 freestyler this year with a 22.33 done at the Stockholm Open earlier this month. He was the 2017 silver medalist in the 50 free, and his 2018 time is faster than last year’s winning time in the same event.\n\nSweden will also return breaststroker Hannah Brunzell from last year’s roster, where she took bronze medals in both the 100 and 200 meter distances. She’s currently the 2nd-ranked Swede in 2018 in the 100 and 3rd-ranked in the 200, though she hasn’t yet surpassed her 2017 best times.\n\nSweden ranked 16th in the medals table at this meet last year with 1 silver and 4 bronzes overall, though their 5 total medals were the 6th-most.\n\nSweden Roster – 2018 European Junior Championships\n\nSwimmer Team Hanna Bergman SK Poseidon Hannah Brunzell Västerås SS Trine Forss Skövde SS Wiggo Frohde SK Neptune Linnea Gipperth Saltsjöbadens IF Robin Hanson Järfälla S Emil Hassling Landskrona S Annie Hegmegi Jönköping SS Marcus Holmquist Jönköping SS Edith Jernstedt Västerås SS Linus Kahl Landskrona S Julia Månsson Örebro SA Elias Persson Malmö KK Gustav Persson Helsingborgs S Johan Rydahl Karlstad SS Hilja Schimmel Skövde SS Björn Seeliger Södertälje SS\n\nSweden will also send a different group to the 2018 Nordic Youth Championships that will be held in Riga, Latvia from July 14th-15th. Sweden placed 2nd in the junior division of the 2017 Nordic Swimming Championships in Reykjavik, Iceland last year with 307 points – behind only Denmark’s 364 points."
