        "text": "The Rangers didn’t have a ton of holes in their roster heading into the offseason and lacked the financial flexibility to make any major changes. After several seasons spent stocking up on youth and futures, first-year GM Chris Drury had lots of options to add to the roster at the 2021-22 trade deadline and he did so in a big way. But after the run to the Eastern Conference final, reality set in: The Rangers are going to have to target areas to add and hope to find some gems around the edges.\n\nOut went Andrew Copp and Ryan Strome, in came Vincent Trocheck. Out went Alexandar Georgiev, in came Jaroslav Halak. Out went Kevin Rooney, in came Ryan Carpenter. Nothing too fancy or complicated.\n\nBut there is one true unknown coming to camp — European free agent center Gustav Rydahl. The 27-year-old lefthanded shot has been a fixture in the Swedish League since he was a teenager but after a season with Färjestad that was his second straight 30-point year, the Rangers took a gamble and signed Rydahl to a one-year, one-way deal for $750,000.\n\nMuch like what the Leafs try to do with an expensive core, the Rangers are dipping into the Euro FA market to try and pull up an inexpensive, unexpected addition to their bottom six to bring some new blood into the organization and perhaps open the door to becoming a team that welcomes low-cost risks from the European leagues.\n\n“I think he has a chance,” Färjestad coach Tomas Mitell said of Rydahl, who had 15 goals and 30 points in 44 games last season, fifth on the team in scoring. “He plays more of a North American style than a Swedish style, I think, so that gives him a chance. He has some grit to him, he has a temper. That will help. He had some points last year but he didn’t get them with amazing skill — it was speed, strength and power. And his work ethic is strong. That makes me believe he can succeed there in the right spot.”\n\nMitell only coached the 6-foot-3, 201-pound Rydahl for the very end of last season, taking over as coach in late February. But Mitell has plenty of knowledge about the NHL game, having been an assistant to Jeremy Colliton behind the Blackhawks bench for two-plus seasons until most of that staff was fired early last year.\n\nHe said Rydahl’s age and experience should actually help his chances to crack the bottom end of the Rangers roster at some point this season. Since he’s a first-year player, Rydahl doesn’t need waivers to be sent to the AHL, so his chances of making the team out of camp are slim. But as long as Rydahl is interested in staying in North America the whole season he should get a chance to come up without many NHL-ready centers in the organization.\n\n“In Chicago we were obviously looking for players for the future. The Rangers want to win, so I think (Rydahl) being a bit older helps him,” Mitell said. “He’s played playoffs here, Olympics. He’s not really learning anymore. And from what I understand he wants to give it a try there the whole year. We would love to have him back but he’s very determined. He had a chance to sign in the NHL 2-3 years ago and got injured, so it has been a goal of his.”\n\nRydahl played power play and penalty kill for Färjestad and was one of Mitell’s three reliable faceoff-takers, an area the Rangers could always use help in. “Faceoffs are more important in the NHL than we consider them here,” he said, “so maybe he won’t be so good at it right away. But he can do things that you want from the bottom six.”\n\nCarpenter, who played for Gerard Gallant in Vegas, is ahead of Rydahl heading into camp in what could be a battle for the fourth-line center spot. Rydahl can play wing, and Dryden Hunt, Ryan Reaves, Julien Gauthier and camp tryout Jimmy Vesey are all battling there as well. And highly regarded prospects Will Cuylle and Brennan Othmann will get long looks with the main group in camp, so the Rangers aren’t totally bereft of options.\n\nOne NHL European scout gave this assessment of Rydahl: “He’s a big guy, he works hard and can definitely be a 4C in the league. Reminds me a bit of (Joonas) Kemppainen who came over to the Bruins a few years ago for a season. A short-term patch who can fill in when you need him.”\n\nRydahl isn’t going to necessarily stand out at camp or in the preseason, but that’s not what Drury and the Rangers European scouting staff were looking for. On a team as top-heavy at forward as the Rangers are, depth is what cost them some consistency at times last season — they needed better options for the bottom six, especially after the Sammy Blais injury. Drury was able to temporarily patch that with the deadline additions of Copp, Frank Vatrano and Tyler Motte, but those weren’t season-long fixes.\n\nRydahl might be, even if he starts in Hartford.\n\n“Probably his biggest area to work on is around the boards, the battling,” Mitell said. “If he can get that up, he’s already got the style down — he likes to take the puck north, get on the forecheck. His type of game can translate.”\n\n(Photo: Petr David Josek / AP Photo)"
