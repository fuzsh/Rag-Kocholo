Behance link. Creative Market link. More recent Creative Market link. Home page. [Google] [More] ⦿\n\nA2 Type\n\n[Henrik Kubel]\n\nA2-Type (or simply, A2) is a type foundry set up in the autumn of 2010 by the London based design studio A2/SW/HK. The designers are Henrik Kubel and Scott Williams. A2's bespoke type design is mainly the responsibility of Henrik Kubel, though every typeface is developed and approved by both partners. Kubel is self-taught, making his first typefaces while studying at Denmark's Design School from 1992 until 1997. Their typefaces:\n\n4590\n\n60 Display.\n\nAmplify (2013) won an award at TDC 2014.\n\nAntwerp (2011). A readable text family designed by Kubel during an Expert Type Design Class in 2011 at Plantin Genootschap in Antwerp.\n\nA2 Archi (2005, Henrik Kubel): an octagonal face.\n\nA2 Aveny-T (2000, Henrik Kubel): Poster typeface commissioned as aprt of the identity of the Aveny-T theatre in Copenhagen.\n\nAgriculture.\n\nArchi.\n\nBanknote.\n\nA2 Battersea (1999, Henrik Kubel): inspired by Meta, DIN and Transport Alphabet. Followed in 2012 by Battersea Slab.\n\nBauhouse.\n\nA2 Beckett (2008). A condensed sans family with the masculinity of Impact.\n\nBoing.\n\nCopenhagen\n\nA2 CPH Tram (2009, Henrik Kubel): revival of an odd mini-serifed type found on the exterior of Danish trams, ca. 1920.\n\nA2 CWM (2008, Henrik Kubel): constructivist type designed for the headlines and cover of Cold War Modern Design 1945-1970.

A neon tube font.\n\nA2 Flowers (2005, Henrik Kubel): arrows, fists, flourishes, ornaments.\n\nA2 FM: slab serif family.\n\nFoundation (2018) in Sans (Number 44, Condensed, Wide), Serif, and Serif Didot subfamilies. These are all revivals of skeletal typefaces. Foundation Sans Number 44 was inspired by Circular Gothic No. 44 (1879, Charles E. Heyer, for the Great Western Type Foundry). Foundation Sans Condensed and Foundation Sans Wide are derived from two types described as Caractères pour Marques de Linge (typefaces for marking on linen) in the Signes section of the first volume of Spécimen Général des Fonderies Deberny et Peignot (ca. 1934). Foundation Serif is based on Caractère No. 7, another Caractère pour Marques de Linge in that 1934 Deberny & Peignot specimen book. Kubel's inspiration for Foundation Serif Didot was a sheet of lettering (dated 1939) he discovered in the archive of the influential Danish architect and graphic/industrial designer Gunnar Biilmann Petersen, 1897-1968.\n\nGrand. A stencil typeface.\n\nA2 Grot 10 (2009, Henrik Kubel): a take on the Grot Series by Stephenson Blake.

A2 writes: Originally designed as a Garamond-inspired metal typeface by Robert Girard ca. 1921-1923, and published under the name Astrée by Deberny Peignot, the typeface was soon recut and renamed Mazarin by the English foundry Stephenson Blake in 1926. That single style original has now been expertly restored and reimagined as a contemporary typeface in multiple styles.\n\nMelissa Script (2010).\n\nA2 Monday (2003-2016, Henrik Kubel): based on 19th century English vernacular serif signage type.\n\nMoscow Sans (2014-2015).

Think Futura in new clothes. Accompanied by Regular Slab.\n\nSans, Slab and Serif typefaces for a redesign of The New York Times Magazine in 2015. The starting point for the Serif font is the Stephenson Blake Garamond-ish metal typeface Mazarin also known as Astrée from French foundry Deberny & Peignot. The slab fonts used for pull quotes and headlines are a continuation of the magazines existing Stymie font but in a condensed format. The sans fonts are linked to the industrial grotesque types, with metal type specimen versions of Futura and Akzidenz fonts as loose models for inspiration.\n\nNosferato.\n\nOle.\n\nOutsiders (+Outsiders Light and many other weights). A slab serif family.\n\nParsons Green Medium.\n\nA2 Record Gothic (2019, Henrik Kubel), after Robert H. Middleton's American grotesk, Record Gothic (1027, Ludlow). Kubel writes: In celebration of Record Gothic's eclectic history, we designed four related but independent styles: Slab, Mono, Stencil and Outline.\n\nSquare.\n\nStaton.\n\nTagstyle.\n\nTest.\n\nTriumph.\n\nA2 Typewriter (2000, Henrik Kubel): based on Olivetti Typewriter 22.\n\nA2 Vogue Floral: a fashion mag modern display face in two styles.\n\nVogue Paris. Granshan 09 Type Design Competition. 1st Prize, Display fonts.\n\nA2 Zadie (2005, Henrik Kubel): inspired by Edwardian railings surrounding the Royal Army Military College in London.

By contrast, the soft serifs are derived from Vietnamese calligraphy whose brush strokes tend to thicken and pool towards the end.\n\nClerk (2015) is a stencil display typeface based on a sign type (most likely) drawn by Samuel de Clerq in the 1920s for the savings bank of The Hague.

Danish type designer (b. 1973, Kulby, Vestsjalland, Denmark) who obtained his BDes from The Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam, and his MA in typeface design from The University of Reading (2009), based on his type family Markant, which was specifically designed for newspapers and cares about ink traps, wide open bowls, inflection points and other special features. It supports Greek and Cyrillic as well.\n\nHe says: I created a new design again taking inspiration from the early sketches of Dwiggins' Experimental No. 223. I was able to use the very open aperture design of the e in this experiment. The a again explored a inflexion points within the counters, and this was too integrated in the design. Finally lightly rounded wedge shaped base serifs were chosen.\n\nIn 2011, Claus placed Playfair Display with Google Web Fonts. He explains: Playfair Display is a transitional design. From the time of enlightenment in the late 18th century, the broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens. This influenced typographical letterforms to become increasingly detached from the written ones. Developments in printing technology, ink and paper making, made it possible to print letterforms of high contrast and fine hairlines. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the printer and typeface designer John Baskerville's designs, the punchcutter William Martin's typeface for the Boydell Shakespeare (sic) edition, and from the Scotch Roman designs that followed thereafter. As the name indicates, Playfair Display is well suited for titling and headlines. It was followed in 2012 by Playfair Display SC. Free download at CTAN and at Open Font Library.

Abrams taught lettering and typeface design at the Parsons School of Design, the New School for Social Research and at the Columbia University Teachers College. He had over 50 years of Madison Avenue experience designing ads, logos, typography and lettering for Fortune 500 companies and more. His early typefaces were photo types published by Headliners in New York City. He died on June 7, 2001 at age 81.\n\nAbout Augereau: This is the only digitized typeface by George Abrams [in fact, the digitization is due to Charles Nix, for George Abrams]. Its 28 weights include over 2,000 sorts including expert, OsF,&alts. Augereau is named for Antoine Augereau, who was a typographer who had a few claims to fame - one was that he was Claude Garamonds teacher, and two was that he was sentenced to death for heresy in 1544. Heresy for a typographer in 1544 meant that he printed something that the king or the Pope didn't like and died for it.\n\nI would like to thank Poul Steen Larsen for clarifying the history of Abrams' Venetian: The Abrams Venetian was donated to Mr. Poul Kristensen of Herning (in Jutland), then Printer to the Royal Court (which he has ceased to be in 1995). You are right about the font being today locked to Poul Kristensen' old Linotron, from which not even Linotype experts brought in to unlock it, could get it out for conversion into an up-to-date digital font. So the font will disappear from the type arena when Kristensens Linotron one day breaks down. You can trust me, for I was the one who established the contact between George and Mr. Kristensen back in 1986. The font was first used in 1989 in a book by Martin Lowry, British renaissance historian, with the title Venetian Printing. George Abrams' chalk drawings of the entire alphabet in regular and italic were scanned, more precisely vectorised on-screen and downloaded in Denmark by the Kristensens and therefore, in one sense, could be called the first Danish complete font. A sample of the first use of Abrams' Venetian. A second sample from \"Venetian Printing\". Abrams Venetian was digitized at some point by Jorgen Kristensen for Poul Kristensen Grafisk Virksomhed Printer.\n\nApostrophe wrote this about Abrams Caslon: This was actually reviewed by Caflish and, if I remember correctly, Mark vonBronkhorst, so there are at least 3 or 4 copies of it out there, other than the Abrams' estate original data. Sumner Stone once said that this is the best Caslon he has ever seen. At least he has seen it; I haven't.\n\nThe typefaces by Abrams (Abrams Venetian and Augereau) are preserved in the New York City-based Abrams Legacy Collection (see also here).\n\nKlingspor link.

It is specially designed for street signage. Runge writes: To achieve great legibility the design paid much attention to features such as: large x-height, open counters, tiny serifs, slightly rounded corners, square terminals as well as inktraps. Research leading to asgaard is described in Runge's paper The echo of architecture in Danish type design of the 20. century.\n\nIn 2013, Florian graduated from the MATD program at the University of Reading. His graduation typeface was Nomad.\n\nIn 2016, he published the flared lapidary typeface Sherpa Sans at Rosetta. The naming caused a bit of a stir, not so much because of Oskar Boscovitz's Sherpa Sans (2002), but because of an unpublished font by a competitor. Rosetta took the moral high ground (even though it could have fought this trademark and won) and decided to rename Sherpa Sans Gitan.\n\nIn 2018, Borna Izadpanah, Fiona Ross and Florian Runge co-designed the free Google Font Markazi Text. They write: This typeface design was inspired by Tim Holloway's Markazi typeface, with his encouragement, and initiated by Gerry Leonidas as a joint University of Reading and Google project. The Arabic glyphs were designed by Borna Izadpanah and design directed by Fiona Ross, they feature a moderate contrast. It takes its cues from the award-winning Markazi typeface, affording a contemporary and highly readable typeface. The complementary Latin glyphs were designed by Florian Runge. It keeps in spirit with its Arabic counterpart, echoing key design characteristics while being rooted in established Latin traditions.

I have done two others apart from Zeus, but only to earn money, and at that time I really had to do it. I find new typefaces fundamentally and absolutely superflous. In the best cases, new typefaces have a monetary effect, and that is really quite minimal. What we make should be lasting, but: primum vivere... The production of new types is only a 'necessity' within capitalism. Where advertising is transformed into scientific communication the typeface nonsense is pointless.

[Google] [More] ⦿\n\nGustav Jensen\n\nGustav Boerge Jensen was a Danish industrial designer of the art deco era (b. Copenhagen, 1898, d. 1954), artist and letterer. He emigrated to United States, settling in New York City. He began working in the field of industrial design in 1928. His clients included Colophon Quarterly, Covici-friede, United Drug Company and DuPont, for whom he designed book jackets, bindings, and packaging. He was featured in the landmark 1934 article in Fortune magazine about the new profession of industrial design: the article noted that, of the recognized pioneers in the field---including Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss and Walter Dorwin Teague---Jensen was regarded as the top man from a purely aesthetic point of view. Paul Rand considered Jensen his mentor. After the United States entered World War II, demand for Jensen's brand of aesthetic design flagged, and he faded into obscurity. The date and place of his death is uncertain.\n\nHe inspired many typefaces, such as Bodoni Egyptian Pro Thin (2007, Nick Shinn), a mythological Greekish art deco type Jensen first drew in 1931. Nick Curtis made Tasneem NF (2007), after Jensen's 1931 classic, which was drawn for American Alphabets. Jeff Levine added Danish Script Initials JNL (2019) to the collection of revivals.

After a master's degree in Scandinavian Studies from the University of Copenhagen in 1863, he taught, wrote, and published a periodical, Gefn. In 2007, a foreword and useful introduction to handwriting models was added by Gunnlaugur Briem, and he placed all on his web site for free download. I quote: In 1875, Denmark changed handwriting models, replacing blackletter cursive by copperplate. This extended to its Icelandic dominion, where copybooks and model sheets in the new style were in short supply. Eight years later, a much needed handwriting manual by Benedikt Gröndal was published. The old style and the new are similar in appearance but have different letterforms. This picture shows the old blackletter cursive (top) and the new copperplate (bottom)---it was taken from Almanak Hins íslenzka þjóðvinafélags, Copenhagen (1877). Gröndal's copperplate and Gröndal's ronde. The foreword by Briem also shows a Danish ronde that appeared in Rundskrifts-Bogen; til Skolebrug og Hjemmeøvelse, ca. 1880. He also grabs the opportunity to showcase the most handsome of all Icelandic copperplate models done by Jón Þórarinsson in Skrifbók með forskriftum, 1. hefti (Reykjavík, ca. 1896). The American Palmer method, more open but less gracious, is illustrated in this alphabet from 1922 by Steingrímur Arason (from Litla skrifbókin, Reykjavík. Variants of this are shown in the alphabets of Guðmundur I. Guðjónsson, published between 1939 and 1953. Briem concludes: Handwriting based on copperplate was largely abandoned in Icelandic schools in 1984. It was replaced by italic, a modern monoline version of renaissance handwriting that owes much to Ludovico Arrighi's approach. A large selection of model sheets in this style is available for free download from the internet. He also shows Italiuskrift05, his own suggestion for schools.
