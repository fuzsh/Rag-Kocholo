        "text": "The New York Rangers have recalled forward Gustav Rydahl from the Hartford Wolf Pack.\n\nThis season, the 28 year-old has registered 4 goals and 9 points in 24 AHL games. He also has a +2 rating.\n\nNew York is already in Montreal for their game against the Canadiens tonight. It’s possible one or two of the Rangers’ forwards is under the weather or nursing an injury. Filip Chytil was reportedly not feeling well in his last game.\n\nUPDATE: Jonny Brodzinski unavailable paternity leave\n\nRangers call up Gustav Rydahl\n\nRydahl signed a one-year, one-way contract over the summer as a free agent out of the SHL. It should be noted that he is waivers exempt.\n\nIn his four preseason contests, he registered an assist and picked up two shots and was one of the late cuts in camp. Last season for Färjestad BK of the Swedish Hockey League, he recorded 15 goals and 15 assists for 30 points.\n\n“We liked everything he brought,” Gerard Gallant said via Vince Mercogliano. “For a guy we didn’t know at all, I was very impressed with him. He might be a guy that’s going to see some time up here.”\n\nThat time appears to have come from the big Swede, who tips the scales at 6-3 and 201 pounds. The veteran can also play center or wing and can kill penalties.\n\nThe New York Rangers are now back to the max roster limit of 23.\n\nRangers prospects Othmann and Chmelar square off\n\nNew York Rangers prospects Brennan Othmann and Jaroslav Chmelar will face each other in the final of the 2023 World Junior Championship on Thursday night.\n\nThe two players have a bit of history with each other dating back to the 2022 tournament’s preliminary round when Chmelar crunched Othmann from behind. It left both players shaken up with Chmelar being ejected from the game.\n\nAfterwards, the Chmelar reached out to Othmann in order to make amends.\n\n“I texted him and he said there are no hard feelings,” he said. “At the next Rangers camp I will buy him dinner and we will be fine”\n\nWell we’ll see how fine things are after Czechia and Canada battle for Gold. Puck drop is slated for 6:30 pm et and will be broadcast on NHL Network.\n\nCanada roared back on the US with six unanswered goals en route to a 6-2 victory and a chance to repeat as champions. Othmann did not register a point in the match and has 2 goals, 2 assists, for 4 points in six games to date.\n\nOthmann, 19, was selected in the first round of the 2021 draft. He has 13 goals and 35 points in 26 games split between the Flint and Peterborough of the OHL. At the 2022 WJC, he registered 6 points in 6 games to help Canada capture Gold.\n\nCzechia advanced to the final in a thrilling 2-1 overtime win over Sweden. In that match, Chmelar didn’t register a point. In six WJC games, he has 3 goals, 2 assists, for 5 points.\n\nChmelar, 19, was selected in the 5th round of the 2021 Draft. This season, he has 6 goals and 10 points in 18 games with Providence of the NCAA. He registered a goal in three games at the last tournament held in August.\n\nNHL News and Rumors\n\nNHL Recaps.
