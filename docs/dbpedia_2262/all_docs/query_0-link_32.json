        "meta_description": "ROCKLAND - Rex E. 'Pat' O'Brien, 76, died Thursday, August 21, 2008, at his home surrounded by his loving family after a lengthy illness. Born in Rockland, October 17, 1931, he was the second oldest of nine children born to John H. and Iva E. Blake O'Brien.  Rex moved to Massachusetts where he met and married, Shirley A. Lyshorn, in Charleston, February 14, 1952. Rex worked for many years at Emerson Textile in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and later at Zayre Corporation which later became Ames Department Stores.  He retired from Ames in 1992. In 1993, Rex moved with his wife to Rockland, where he has since resided.   Rex had a sharp wit and dry sense of humor.  Anyone who was with him would be laughing.  He thought the game of golf was a waste of time until he played his first game, after which he played every chance he could.   He even had his own set of clubs. In earlier years, he loved to hunt, but later couldn't bring himself to kill an animal.  He also loved to fish, which he caught and released.  He especially enjoyed fishing with his grandchildren.  He loved music of all kinds and was a fabulous dancer, something the family did frequently when his children were little.  Rex loved to read, especially westerns and anything related to his beloved Maine.  More than anything, he loved his family; in his words, 'It's good to be king!' During recent months Rex often stated how proud he was to have been cared for by the 'two most beautiful girls in the world,' his daughter Dawn and granddaughter Amy; as well as his son-in-law Mike, with whom he had a special trusting relationship. Other than his parents, Rex was pre-deceased by his wife Shirley, in 1995; a son, Michael P., in 2001; four sisters Flora 'Babe' O'Hearn, Jeannine Rollins, Sylvia Mancuso, Linda Taylor; a brother Ralph 'Connie' O'Brien and his beloved dog 'Missy'.  He is survived by four children, Noreen O'Brien, Rex W. and his wife Beth, Dawn Marie O'Brien and her husband Mike Strom all of Warren, Brian S. of Wrentham, Mass.; 13 grandchildren; 8 great-grandchildren; two brothers, Michael 'Mickey' of South Carolina, Shawn of California; one sister, Sharon O'Hearn of Massachusetts; as well many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, great-nephews, great-great nieces and great-great nephews. Friends and relatives are invited to visit from 2:00 to 4:00 and 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., Tuesday, August 26, 2008, at Burpee, Carpenter & Hutchins Funeral Home, where a funeral service will be held at 11:00 a.m., Wednesday, August 27th.  The Reverend Laura Edwards will officiate.  Interment will follow in Achorn Cemetery, Rockland. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the American Lung Association of Maine, 122 State Street, Augusta, ME 04330 or online at lungusa.com.",
