        "text": "For fans of action movies, the name Paul Walker will always be associated with tragedy. Paul Walker's death in November 2013 caused a great shock in the world of cinema. Fans of the 'Fast and Furious' saga still mourn the character of Brian O'Conner, after the emotional final scene of the seventh installment.\n\nWhen did Paul Walker die?\n\nPaul Walker died on November 30, 2013, in Santa Clarita, California, in a car accident.\n\nThe Paul Walker accident that shocked the world\n\nThe terrible incident occurred while the star was still filming 'Fast and Furious 7'. In a cruel twist of fate, the protagonist of these action-packed movies on wheels and speed died in a car accident.\n\nThe actor was traveling with his friend, the driver Roger Rodas, who at one point lost control of the vehicle he was driving. After crashing into a lamppost and some trees, the car burst into flames, and both occupants lost their lives.\n\nPaul Walker's accident, like many others in the film industry, immediately caused great shock. Family members, friends, and colleagues such as Vin Diesel (Toretto in 'F&F') were deeply affected by the artist's death. The film postponed its release until 2015, leaving a farewell scene to be remembered.\n\nPaul Walker's death and his final sequence in 'Fast and Furious'\n\nAs mentioned, Paul Walker's death occurred when he had not yet finished filming 'Fast and Furious 7'. To complete his scenes, the film production had to use doubles and CGI technology. Walker's brothers also participated to achieve a closer physical resemblance.\n\nAs a tribute to the late actor, the movie concluded with a highly emotional scene. After seeing footage of Brian O'Conner's character on the beach with his family, he and Toretto finally say goodbye. O'Conner takes a detour with his vehicle and drives off into the horizon, at which point a message dedicating the film to Walker appears.\n\nRoad safety training, key to preventing traffic accidents\n\nVarious investigations concluded that at the time of Paul Walker's accident, the vehicle was traveling at a much higher speed than allowed. Such behaviors, among others, can cost lives behind the wheel. However, it is not easy to raise awareness about responsible behavior until one of these incidents hits close to home.\n\nRoad safety training is a key element in preventing traffic accidents. In Spain, 1,004 people died in such accidents in 2021. When it comes to raising awareness, a new tool is gaining increasing importance: virtual reality.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) recreates realistic scenarios and situations through simulations. In terms of road safety, this translates into providing firsthand experiences to students. Thus, those who receive training can witness or experience virtual accidents, firsthand witnessing the consequences of irresponsible behavior.\n\nLudus' Road Safety Simulation is a powerful tool for safety and occupational health trainers. Recently, a new exercise was included in which the student becomes the driver of the vehicle and must avoid a collision.\n\nIn the exercise, the trainer can configure various variables, such as distractions or the speed at which the trainee is driving. This allows for an immersive experience with a high level of awareness, as the employee experiences sensations while learning.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Road Safety Simulation or how to implement VR in safety and health training, please leave your information on the following link."
