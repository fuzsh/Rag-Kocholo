        "text": "With deep sadness, I announce the loss of my good friend and long-term Contributing Photographer Colin O’Brien, who died unexpectedly last Friday aged seventy-six. Later this week I will publish our final assignment together, undertaken a week ago, when we enjoyed an excursion picking blackcurrants in Kent.\n\nA recent portrait of Colin O’Brien in his Hackney kitchen by Bob Mazzer\n\nOne day, I was walking through Exmouth Market in Clerkenwell when a photograph caught my eye through the window of a restaurant and stopped me in my tracks. I went inside and was truly astonished by a series of large black and white photographs of car crashes upon the wall. I had never seen anything like these pictures before, but the grace and accomplishment of these breathtaking images convinced me that they had been taken by one of the great photographers of our time.\n\nImagine my surprise when I realised that all the photographs had been taken in Clerkenwell by a photographer I had never heard of, Colin O’Brien. Immediately, I wrote to Colin and was delighted to meet a man who was as modest as he was talented. Quickly, we fell into a working partnership, creating stories together using his photographs accompanied by my words. In subsequent years, we undertook more than fifty assignments together.\n\nIt was Colin who persuaded me to become a publisher and create ‘Spitalfields Life Books,’ when he asked me to publish his photographs of ‘Travellers’ Children in London Fields’ in 2013, beginning his collaboration with book designer Friederike Huber. Two years later, they worked together to produce his authoritative and tender monograph of the capital through seven decades entitled ‘London Life,’ which I also published.\n\nColin once said to me that while Don McCuillin went away to photograph war and David Bailey occupied himself with fashion and celebrities, he had stayed at home and simply photographed the life of people on the street. A purist who managed to resist any commercial imperative or editorial intervention, Colin took only the photographs he pleased, resolutely pursuing his own personal interests and focussing particulary upon the everyday lives of Londoners.\n\nColin’s brilliant portraits of children reveal his singular empathy with the young and also his unassuming nature, never putting himself above those he photographed, so that subjects discovered a rare freedom in front of his lens, liberated by his kindly nature to present themselves as they pleased.\n\nIn his teens, Colin was fortunate enough to receive a 1931 Leica camera from a neighbour in Clerkenwell who worked as a chauffeur and ‘discovered’ it left behind by a wealthy client. It was with this lucky acquisition that Colin took much of his precocious early work, some of which was exhibited to great acclaim last year at the Leica Gallery, delivering a satisfying poetic resolution to the narrative arc of his long photographic career.\n\nI was grateful to Colin for his reliable ability to put people at their ease, his extraordinary stamina and resilient good humour, but most of all I feel privileged to have collaborated with such an inspirational talent. My admiration for Colin’s genius only increased over time. The sheer volume of his work between 1948 and 2016 is monumental – I believe his achievement in photography is unique and incomparable, and I know he was one of the great masters of our time.\n\nColin marches in the Clerkenwell Italian procession in the forties\n\nColin with his first camera, a Box Brownie\n\nColin photographed by Solly, a local Photographer in Exmouth Market\n\nColin’s parents with their young son the roof of Victoria Dwellings, Clerkenwell\n\nColin as Head Boy at Sir John Cass School, Aldgate\n\nColin with his first Leica\n\nColin photographs his mother trying on hats in Oxford St in the fifties\n\nColin on the roof of Victoria Dwellings with St James Clerkenwell in the background\n\nA self-portrait, skylarking with pals at the Kardomah Cafe, Oxford St\n\nColin looking sharp in the sixties\n\nColin looking with-it in the seventies\n\nColin at his photography show on Waterloo Station\n\nColin at the Aldgate Press for the printing of ‘Travellers Children in London Fields’\n\n[youtube jlklWeiIRCM nolink]\n\nColin talks about photographing the ‘Travellers Children in London Fields’\n\nColin at L.E.G.O for the printing of ‘London Life’\n\nColin at the launch of ‘London Life’ (photo by Simon Mooney)\n\nColin with Friederike Huber who designed ‘London Life’ (photo by Simon Mooney)\n\nColin taking a photo in the Italian church in Clerkwenwell with his 1931 Leica (photo by Alex Pink)\n\nColin O’Brien (1940-2016)\n\nThe Gentle Author’s portrait of Colin O’Brien on the balcony of the flat in Michael Cliffe House, Clerkenwell, which Colin moved into with his parents when it was newly-built in 1966\n\nYou may like to take a look at this selection of Colin O’Brien’s work\n\nColin O’Brien, Photographer\n\nColin O’Brien’s Travellers Children in London Fields\n\nColin O’Brien’s Brick Lane Market\n\nColin O’Brien’s Clerkenwell Car Crashes\n\nColin O’Brien at the Clerkenwell Italian Parade\n\nColin O’Brien Goes Back to School\n\nThe Fly-Pitchers of Spitalfields\n\nGina’s Restaurant Portraits\n\nColin O’Brien’s Kids on the Street\n\nAt Colin O’Brien’s Flat\n\nAt the Hula Hoop Festival\n\nColin O’Brien’s Pellicci Portraits\n\nAt Carters Steam Fair\n\nGerry Cottle, Circus Showman\n\nAt Smithfield Christmas Eve Meat Auction\n\nSo Long, Clerkenwell Fire Station\n\nPeter Sargent, Butcher\n\nAt the Blind Beggar\n\nOn the Buses With Colin O’Brien\n\nAt the Whitechapel Mission\n\nAmong the Druids on Primrose Hill\n\nJasmine Stone & Sam Middleton, Campaigning Stratford Mothers\n\nAt the Spitalfields Nativity Procession\n\nLast Orders at the Gun\n\nScything on Walthamstow Marshes\n\nHop Picking at Lamberhurst\n\nAt the Blessing of the River\n\nElegy for Upton Park\n\nGeorge Parrin, Ice Cream Seller\n\nAt Denmark St"
