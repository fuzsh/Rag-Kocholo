        "text": "This will be a page for stuff I know about the O'Brien name, and Irish stuff In general. I dont have a whole heck of alot here right now as you can see. But it will fill in.\n\nLamh ladir an uachdar.\n\nThis is the motto for the O'Brien clan. Literally translated it means \"The strong arm uppermost\". I think that a more modern and fitting meaning is much closer to \"The strong have the upper hand\".\n\nBrian Boru\n\nHigh King (\"Ard Ri\") of Ireland from 1002 - 1015, Brian Boru restored Ireland to its glory after Viking invasions. He later led unified Irish clans against the Vikings in several great battles.\n\nOn Good Firday, 1014 at the Battle of Clontarf, Brian led the Irish against the Norse in a battle that ultimately squelched the Viking hope of conquering Ireland. As the defeated Norse foces retreated, a small band of the invaders managed to sneak to Brian's tent. Nearly 80 years old, Brian was still able to kill several assailants. Legend has it that before he died, Brian was even able to behead the man who inflicted his mortal wound.\n\nO'Brien Clan\n\nThe O'Brien clan surname is derived directly from King Brian Boru's name. Meaning \"Son of Brian\" the O'Brien name is one of the most prominent names throughout Irish history."
