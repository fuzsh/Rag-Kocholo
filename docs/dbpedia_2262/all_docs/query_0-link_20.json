Her academic studies included the study of burial evidence for the Late prehistoric-Early Historic period in Ireland and related Early Irish History.Â She graduated with a D.Phil from the University of Oxford where she studied the burial evidence for post-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England, this included the building of a database of burials for the period being reviewed.
