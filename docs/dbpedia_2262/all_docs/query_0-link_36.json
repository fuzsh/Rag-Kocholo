        "text": "BRADENTON – Scott O’Brien’s recent COVID-19-related death leaves family members and friends mourning his loss and appreciating and honoring the impact he had on their lives.\n\nScott, his wife Gale, and their daughters, Kristin and Alyssa, relocated from New York to Bradenton in 1992 and established deep roots in the Cortez, Bradenton, Anna Maria Island and Manatee County communities.\n\nAfter contracting COVID-19, O’Brien passed away at Blake Medical Center on Monday, Aug. 2. He was 62 and had previously received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\n“Both of my parents had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in March and the doctor who was caring for my dad said he did not think the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was working as well as the others. He recommended that anyone who got it try to get another vaccine,” Kristin Slicker said, noting that it’s very difficult to get a second and separate vaccine.\n\n“My mom had COVID at the same time my dad did. She is also somewhat still recovering, but she’s feeling a lot better. She’s still very tired and has a lingering cough. She didn’t need to go to the hospital, but it was rougher for her than it should have been for somebody’s who’s vaccinated,” Kristin said.\n\nKristin said she asked the doctors and nurses if her dad contracted the Delta variant, but they didn’t know.\n\nScott and Gale met when they were each 13 years old and they were married for 41 years.\n\n“Gale was the love of his life and he truly adored her,” Kristin said. “My mom’s doing pretty good. Better than I expected. I think she’s feeling a little bit of shock, but she’s doing pretty good. I think the celebration of life on Sunday is going to make it more real for us.”\n\nA celebration of Scott’s life will be held on Sunday, Aug. 15, from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Bradenton Elks Lodge #1511 at 2511 75th St. W.\n\nKristin and her husband, Brian Slicker, also received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\n“We felt like we did the right thing. We got vaccinated and now I don’t know if I got any protection? It’s not just the Johnson & Johnson. I don’t know if I’d feel comfortable with any vaccination. I’m a hairstylist. I’m around a lot of people every day and I don’t necessarily feel protected anymore. I’ve been wearing a mask and about half my clients have been vaccinated,” she said.\n\nIn the wake of her father’s death, Kristin posted the following message at her Facebook page: “It’s surreal, it’s unimaginable, it’s not fair. When people refer to someone as ‘the best’ I always think about what their best attributes are. Then I realize my dad had them all. He was the best person to talk to, the best person to ask questions, the best to watch sports with, the best teacher, the best advice giver, the best cook, the best drinking buddy, the best handyman. He was the best everything! Not to mention the best husband, father, grandfather and friend! To say he will be missed is an understatement. I am walking around with a void, an empty spot, that can’t be filled. My dad would do anything for anyone and not think twice about it. He truly was The Best!”\n\nRegarding COVID-19, Kristin wrote, “It doesn’t matter what the odds are, please don’t think it can’t happen to you or your loved ones.”\n\nBeloved family man\n\nIn 2011, Scott retired as a telecommunications supervisor for Manatee County. Over the years, he also coached football for the Manatee Wildcats, served on the North River Fire District Pension Board and was a trustee for Bradenton Elks Lodge #1511. He also assisted many charitable organizations with their events and fundraisers.\n\nIn recent years, Scott spent his days caring for his grandsons, Rowan, 6, and Corbin, 3, while Kristin and Brian worked. Kristin said Rowan has some comprehension of losing his grandfather, but Corbin is still too young to process that news.\n\nWhen asked what she’ll miss the most about her dad, Kristin said, “Everything. He was always there.”\n\nWhen asked the same question about her dad, Alyssa O’Brien said, “Being able to pick up the phone and call him. He was the person that would have my back for anything.”\n\nWhen asked what her dad taught her about life, Kristin said, “Everything. He had the answers to everything.”\n\nAlyssa said, “He taught me to treat people correctly; and how to go into a situation where maybe you don’t know anybody but will by the time you leave.”\n\nWhen asked how she hopes her dad is remembered, Kristin said, “As a nice person. I feel sometimes he was so nice that people thought he was being sarcastic.”\n\nAlyssa said, “As the kindest person that anyone will ever know.”\n\nWhen discussing his father-in-law, Brian said, “It’s a big blow. They did everything they possibly could. His lungs were just too bad from the COVID.”\n\nBrian said Scott had borderline high blood pressure and was a heavy-set man but had no other known comorbidities or pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nAs for how he met Scott, Brian said, “My uncle (Bob Slicker) said I should come over to his best friend Scott’s house. He said, ‘I think you’ll be friends.’ Kristin was 19 or 20 at the time.”\n\nBrian then shared his favorite Scott story.\n\n“When Kristin turned 21, her and a group of friends went to Las Vegas. Scott and I were drinking and hanging out at the Anchor Inn in Holmes Beach. We were in the corner of the bar and Brad was bartending. Scott asked me to make a toast, and I said, ‘Here’s to you letting me marry your daughter.’ I barely knew Kristin at the time and he said, “Son, I hope you’re kidding. I like you, you’re a great guy, but I hope it would be a different way that you would ask me that. I said I was totally kidding and we did our shot.\n\n“A few years later, Kristin and I were dating. I took Scott out for drinks and we decided we were going to have one more. It was late and there weren’t many places still open so we went to the Anchor. We sat in the same corner with the same shot and the same bartender and I said, ‘Scott, years ago I brought you here and now I’m ready to do that shot for real. I hope I can have your blessing. He looked at me and said, ‘I’ve been waiting for the day you would ask.’”\n\nWhen asked what he’ll miss most about Scott, Brian said, “Our relationship. I feel like I was the lucky one. I work from home and he watched our sons because I really can’t do my job when I’m focusing on them. I would come out for lunch and for breaks and I probably got to talk to him more than anyone else. I would walk out of my office and he would be there. I could talk to him about anything. I’m going to miss not seeing him and not having him around anymore. He treated me like family from the day he met me. I was invited to sit at his dinner table after knowing him for less than five minutes.”\n\nScott taught Brian how to make plumbing and drywall repairs and other remodeling work, but he also taught Brian about life and how to live it.\n\n“He showed me the perfect example of what a family should be. I grew up in a different type of family than my wife did. Scott taught me the importance of being there for your family and staying together as a family. As generations go by, that’s something that’s fallen between the cracks. We’re going to continue to get together and stay together as a family,” Brian said.\n\nA best friend\n\nScott’s favorite sports team was the New York Giants. He also loved the Tampa Bay Bucs, the Tampa Bay Rays and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Scott was best friends with Slicker’s Eatery owner and former Swordfish Grill General Manager Bob Slicker. During Slicker’s tenure at the Swordfish Grill, Scott and his family frequently watched Lightning games there – including last year’s Stanley Cup victory. When Bob opened his own restaurant earlier this year, Scott and his family celebrated the Lightning’s second consecutive NHL championship at Slicker’s Eatery.\n\n“I met Scott through my Aunt Cookie more than 20 years ago. She said we had a lot in common and might become best friends. Two days later, I said, ‘Let’s meet for beers.’ We did, and he said, ‘If we’re going to be best friends, I’ve got to introduce you to my wife and daughters.’ I rode with him to his house and he said, ‘Kristin and Alyssa, come meet your ‘Uncle Bob.’ Kristin and Alyssa made us shots and that’s how it started. And later, my nephew, Brian, married his daughter, Kristin, after I introduced them,” Bob said.\n\n“Scott was a major part of every success I had. He and his family and everyone around him would always help, no matter what I was doing. This is the biggest hole I’ve ever had in my life. He was that big, that kind, that generous and that non-judgmental. Scott was a laid-back guy. He didn’t get too excited and he tried to help anybody he could,” Bob said.\n\n“It’s a horrible thing. I was in the ER looking through a window at my very best friend dying. Two doors down, two 30-year-old men were saying goodbye to their friend for the last time,” Bob said."
