His death certificate, however, lists the date as June 26, 1930. In The Worley Family Record, the date of his marriage is listed as Dec. 31, 1891, but in his obituary, it's listed as Dec. 21, 1891. The Worley book lists his wife's nickname as \"Tina\" (page 23), but many other sources spell the name as \"Tena.\"\n\nIn The Worley Family Record, the death date of Frank Frashour is given as 1955, but it should actually be 1954. Two articles about his death appear in the Lowell Tribune -- one on page 5 in the June 17, 1954, paper, and the other on page 1 in the June 24, 1954, issue.\n\nIn The Worley Family Record, the birth date of Benjamin F. (Frank) Worley is given as Dec. 15, 1875 (page 21), and Dec. 16, 1875 (page 103). His obituary in The Lowell Tribune lists it as the 15th The wedding date is given as Aug. 20, 1898, in this book, but is listed as Aug. 20, 1899, in his wife's obituary in The Lowell Tribune. Since their 52nd anniversary is covered in a 1950 Lowell Tribune article, it would seem that 1898 is the correct year.\n\nWhile The Worley Family Record puts the death date of August Westberg as July 21, 1940, his wife's obituary says that he died in 1938.\n\nThe Worley Family Record puts Lewis Milford Worley's death date as March 13, 1950, but his obituary in the Lowell Tribune says he died on March 12, 1950. The Lowell Tribune also lists his middle initial as \"E.\" and his marriage date as Sept. 6, 1906, rather than Sept. 10, 1906, which is listed in The Worley Family Record.\n\nChildren of Benjamin Franklin Worley and Anna Sargent\n\nNAME BORN DIED MARRIED SPOUSE Logan Worley Oct. 15, 1877 Oct. 15, 1877 -- none\n\nChildren of Henry L.

Her granddaughter, Denise Frashour Franklin, writes, \"My grandmother's first name is Ina; her middle name is Inez. She went by Ina, not Inez.\n\nIn The Worley Family Record Margaret Frashour is listed as having had only one husband, Albert Akers, who she married in 1922. The 1951 obituary of her mother, however, lists her as being married to Lawrence Sparks of Gary, and her father's obituary in 1954 lists her as Mrs. Duke Hinkle.\n\nChildren of August Westberg and Ida May Worley\n\nNAME BORN DIED MARRIED SPOUSE Ada Myrle Westberg Aug. 16, 1889 -- -- John Cuplin Lester Westberg June 4, 1892 Nov. 4, 1893 -- none Pearl Westberg Sept. 1895 * -- -- ______ Bloom Charles Edson Westberg May 21, 1897 -- -- -- Alma Westberg ___ 9, 1899 * -- -- Leonard Barrett Hilma Westberg Dec. 3, 1903 -- July 30, 1925 Kenneth Babcock Harry Westberg Apr. 10, 1907 -- 1)\n\n2) Nov. 8, 1946\n\n1) Betty ______\n\n2) Florence Ridgeway\n\n(b.

The Worley Family Record lists Henry Worley marrying Eva (maiden name unknown) on June 27, 1922. Geraldine, who died in 1935, is listed as their daughter. However, in Geraldine's obituary, she is said to have been a 1933 Lowell High school graduate and 19 years old at the time of her death.

In the obituary of Sadie Marie Worley Harris Spencer, however, Mrs. Mary Ellen Hollister is listed as Sadie's daughter. Mrs. Doris Jean Worley Hartman, who sent the library many photos, obituraries and other information on the Worley family explained that while Mary Ellen was the daughter of Edna Glee Worley Herron, Edna's sister Sadie raised her.\n\nChildren of Harry E.
