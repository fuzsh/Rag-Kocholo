Snáimh-dá-en (swim-two-birds), is one of the resting-places of Sweeney (in Buile Suibhne) after his madness came upon him at the battle of Moira [Magh Rath], on Devinish Island between Clonmacnoise and Shannonbridge; Flann OBrien spent part of his childhood at nearbyTullamore, in Co. Offaly. (See P. J. Kavanagh, Voices in Ireland, 1994, p.150.)\n\nWhy Flann? Flann OBrien told his publisher that he adopted the name Flann for the benefit of a common Irish name (OBrien) with an unusual one (q. source). But A Short History of Ireland by P. W. Joyce offers a possibly different inspiration in the form of an account of a work called the Synchronisms of Flann, of whose author he writes:\n\nThis Flann was a layman, Ferleginn or chief professor of the school of Monasterboice: died in 1056. He compares the chronology of Ireland with that of other countries, and gives the names of the monarchs that reigned in Assyria, Persia, Greece, and Rome, from the most remote period, together with most careful lists of the Irish kings who reigned contemporaneously with them. Copies of this tract, but imperfect, are preserved in the Books of Lecan and Ballymote. (P. W. Joyce, A Short History of Ireland from the Earliest Times to 1608, Longmans 1893, p.27.)\n\nThe case is a little comparable with that of James Joyce who inevitably included the Martyrology of Gorman in the Shem chapter of the Wake - reflecting the biography of himself that had been prepared by Herbert Gorman. Modern Irish writers must have their ancient antecedents. Perhaps, too, OBrien felt that the multiculturalism of his avatar - or, at least, his zany collocation of radically disparate culture epochs - was apposite to his own procedure as a deeply achronological writer. [BS]\n\nSuibhnes verses: Terrible is my plight this night / the pure air has pierced my body, / lacerated feet, my cheek is green - / Oh might God, it is my due. [&c.], selected in Flann OBriens translation from At Swim-Two-Birds (Penguin edn., p.84); otherwise entitled Wolves for Company in Frenzy of Sweeney, from John Montague, ed., The Faber Book of Irish Verse (1974), p.83.\n\nThe Third Policeman (1967): A thriller, a hilarious comic satire about an archetypal village police force, a surrealistic vision of eternity, the story of a tender, brief, unrequited love affair between a man and his bicycle, and a chilling fable of unending guilt, The Third Policeman is comparable only to Alice in Wonderland as an allegory of the absurd. Distinguished by endless comic invention and its delicate balancing of logic and fantasy, The Third Policeman is unique in the English language. (See COPAC records online; accessed 24.08.2009.)\n\nMyles na Gopaleen - meaning Myles of the Ponies [lit. Little Horses]. OBriens Irish Times pseudonym was originally the sobriquet of a character in a play by Dion Boucicault and, prior to that, a character in Gerald Griffin's Collegians (1829) - as supra.\n\nStage version: A theatrical adaptation of At Swim-Two Birds was made by by Ridiculusmus, a Derry and London-based company wit David Woods, John Hough, Pete McCabe, and Angus Barr (reviewed at Cleeres Theatre, in Kilkenny, Sunday Ind., 20.8.1995).\n\nLocus classicus: A proximate source for the pastiche of Irish medieval lyrics conducted by Flann OBrien in At Swim-Two-Birds is to be found in the Cyclops episode of Joyces Ulysses, viz., the song of the Citizens dog Garryowen: The curse of my curses / Seven days every day / And seven dry Thursdays / On you, Barney Kiernan, / Has no sup of water / To cool my courage, / And my guts red roaring / After Lowrys lights. (Ulysses, Bodley Head Edn.,p.404.)\n\nSharpened needles (in The Third Policeman): The idea of sharpness connected with iron needless is the subject of a discourse in J. M. Synges Aran Islands (1907). Take a sharp needle, he said, and stick it under the collar of your coat, and not one of them will be able to have power on you. Iron is a common talisman with barbarians, but in this case the idea of exquisite sharpness was probably present also, and perhaps some feeling for the sanctity of the instrument of toil, a folk-belief that is common in Brittany. The fairies are more numerous in Mayo than in any other country, though they are fond of certain districts in Galway [ ]. (Coll. Works, II: Prose, 1966, ed. Alan Price; p.80).\n\nCarletonesque? Compare the nature-descriptions of The Third Policeman with this in the opening passage of William Carletons Ned MKeown: [A] delightful vale, which runs up, for twelve or fourteen miles, between two ranges of dark, well-defined mountains, that give to the interjacent country the form of a low inverted arch. [..., &c.; p.22, and the following on Knockmany:] On the north-west side ran a ridge of high hills, with the cloud-capped peak of Knockmany rising in lofty eminence above them; these, as they extended towards the south, became gradually deeper in their hue, until at length they assumed the shape and form of heath-clad mountains, dark and towering. The prospect on either range is highly pleasing, and capable of being compared with any I have ever seen, in softness, variety, and that serene lustre which reposes only on the surface of a country rich in the beauty of fertility, and improved, by the hand of industry and taste. Opposite Knockmany, at a distance of about four miles, on the south-eastern side, rose the huge and dark outline of Cullimore, standing out in gigantic relief against the clear blue of a summer sky, and flinging down his frowning and haughty shadow almost to the firm-set base of his lofty rival; or, in winter, wrapped in a mantle of clouds, and crowned with unsullied snow, reposing in undisturbed tranquillity, whilst the loud voice of storms howled around him. [...; &c.] (Wildgoose Lodge and Other Stories, ed. Maurice Harmon, Cork: Mercier Press 1973, pp.22-23.)\n\nJoseph Sheridan le Fanu: ONolan read the stories and novels of Le Fanu in teen-age and was actually reading him when a neighbouring house was visted by a poltergeist, according to his brother Ciaráns account: Presently, you would hear the sash of a window being pulled up roughly, even though you knew all the windows were closed and locked. Then the sound of a small iron ball being rolled across the bedroom floor. This would be followed by the sound of something heavy falling down the stairs making massive thumps. (Quoted in Roger Boylan, We Laughed, We Cried: Flann OBriens triumph, in Boston Review, 1 July 2008 - available online; accessed 05.08.2021.) [Vide, Ciarán Ó Nualláin, The Early Years of Brian ONolan, Flann OBrien, Myles na gCopaleen; trans. Róisín Ní Nualláin, ed. Niall ONolan, Dublin: Lilliput Press 1998; qpp.]\n\n[ top ]\n\nSheepness of allsheep: OBrien owes an obvious debt to James Joyce in his celebrated account of the atomic structure of a sheep: What is a sheep only millions of little bits of sheepness whirling around and doing intricate convolutions inside the sheep? What else is it but that? (The Third Policeman, 1993 Edn., p.86.) Cf. Stephen Dedalus: Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of mans blood they creepycrawl after Blakes buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past. (Ulysses, Bodley Head Edn., 1962, p.238.)\n\nJ. W. Dunne: Dunnes Experiment with Time offers a conceptual framework of The Third Policeman: Death involves the continuation of the mind, but on a different time scale, called time 2. The mind, when it enters this different time-scale, which is the fourth dimension (a dimension which does not involve any kind of forward progression) wanders about in a daze and has to learn to control its focus of attention. Otherwise its new world seems like the world of a nightmare. [Student source.]\n\nWilliam Saroyan [1]: OBrien was not unique in wishing to write like Saroyan. See, for instance, a story by John Hillier, in which the Bob Crawshaw, a British World War II bomber, writes a chit for sending home if he does not return: He got to his bunk and took his pen and some paper and sat down and wrote Dear Father and Mother and Eileen. [26] Then he leaned back and chewed the end of his pen, and he thought, Christ, I wish I could write like William Saroyan and those types, and he thought of flying at night on a trip. Up there with yourself, feeling tingling all over your body with no taste except the nothing but the dryness of the back of your throat and seeing everything, including your own death, and your own aircraft catching fire and falling out of the sky, leaving you still up there watching it and yet being all the time inside the plane in the middle of all the searchlight beams on Gods earth and the red, white and green sausages of small-arms fire curling all round the sky in search of you. (Daylight on Berlin, in The Penguin New Writing, ed. John Lehmann, March 1943, pp.25-26; cf. OBriens letter to Saroyan, quoted in Anthony Cronin, No Laughing Matter, 1989, as given in Quotations, supra.)\n\nWilliam Saroyan [2]: Note that the epithet bum - as in Flanns phrase bum book - also occurs in an American connection when Sean OFaolain records, in Vive Moi, that an American friend once said to me when I talked to him about University College Cork: Well Sean, it may have been a bum joint but it suited you down to the ground. (Vive Moi, q.p.; quoted in John A. Murphy, OFaolain and U.C.C., in The Irish Review, 26 (Autumn 2000), pp.38-50; p.40.)\n\nFlann & DIAS: Eamon de Valera helped Erwin Schrödinger [var. Schroedinger] to escape Nazi Germany with his wife and attached him to the DIAS. Schrödinger gave a lecture at Dublin University (TCD) Metaphysical Soc. with arguments for not regarding causality as an irremissable necessity of thought and claiming that open-mindedness towards these questions was the most imperative demand. Flann OBrien objected to an argument that could do away with the first cause and let fly at the Institute in his Irish Times column during Nov. 1942: Talking of this notorious Institute (Lord, what I would give for a chair in it with me thousand good-lookin pounds a year for doing work that most people regard as recreation). A friend has drawn my attention to Professor ORahillys recent address on Palladius and Patrick. / I understand also that Professor Schrödinger has been proving lately that you cannot establish a first cause. The first fruit of the Institute therefore, has been an effort to show that there are two Saint Patricks and no God. [...] The propagation of heresy and unbelief has nothing to do with polite learning, and unless we are careful this Institute of ours will make us the laughing stock of the world. (Alannah Hopkin, The Living Legend of St Patrick, NY: St. Martins Press, 1989, p.151.)\n\nSee also How Myles na gCopaleen belled Schrödingers cat, in Irish Times (22 Feb. 2001) - with the additional information that Schrödinger laughed off the attack but the DIAS demanded an apology from the editor Robert Smyllie, who supplied it along with an assurance that Myles would never mention the Institute again. (See further under Quotations, supra, and see also note on Arthur Riordan, Improbable Frequency, infra.]\n\nDord Fian: The music that Finn loved was that which filled the heart with joy and gave light to the countenance, the song of the black bird of Letter Lee, and the melody of the Dord Fian, the sound of the wind in Droum-Derg, the thunders of Assaroe, the cry of the hounds let loose through Glen Ra, with their faces outward from the Suir, the Tonn Rury lashing the shore, the wash of water against the side of ships, the cry of Bran at Knock-an-awr, the murmur of streams at Slieve-mish and oh, the black bird of Derry-Cairn. I never heard, by my soul, sound sweeter than that. Were I only beneath his nest! (q. trans.; John Philip Cohane, The Indestructible Irish (NY: Hawthorn Books 1969, p.172.)\n\nDear Editor: Nolan wrote up to nine letters under daily to The Irish Times under different names during 1940, before he was given a column of his own. Two in One, a story of a taxidermists assistant who murders his employer and hides within his skin, only to be arrested for his own murder. (David Wheatley, review of John Wyse Jackson, ed., Flann OBrien at War: Myles na gCopaleen 1940-1945, Duckworth 1999, in Times Literary Supplement, 21 July, 2000, p.29.)\n\nHome Rule?: Thats a nice piece of law and order for you, a terrific indictment of democratic self-government, a beautiful commentary on Home Rule. (The Third Policeman, Flamingo Edn. 1993, p.165.) Flann OBrien appears to set his second in the period of Home Rule, a form of independence never actually accorded to Ireland and perhaps intended as a jocose equivalent of the Irish Free State. Equally, this might be taken as feature of the three policemen, who stand as oddly Victorian figures in their Irish setting, or else contemporaries of the novelist who remain uncertain as to prevailing politic arrangements in the era when the novel - and their part in it - is set (viz., 1940).\n\nConan Kennedy: Kennedy conjectures that the name de Selby is taken from the De Selby Quarries on Mount Seskin Road between Terenure and Blessington, nr. Jobstown [nr. Tallaght], from which hard-core for the roads of S. Dublin was extracted, and pursues the connection with Walter Conan (1867-1936), proprietor of a tailoring firm which made academic gowns and shared buildings and business interests with the De Selby company as well as being - more significantly - was the inventor of a meat preservation system, incandescent gas lamps, a keyless lock and an index carding sysem and a depth charge (patent fuse) that was adopted by the British war office as an anti-submarine weapon. Sir John Ross and Walter Conan himself give accounts of the invention, trial and attempted exploitation of the fuse. (See Looking for De Selby, Killala: Morrigan 1998). [Note: Jobstown (nr. Mt Seskin is the highest of the Tallaght Hills.]\n\nOscar OBrien: At one place, a least, Flann adopts the Wildean manner of wit in characterising the peculiarities of De Selby: Another of de Selbys weaknesses was his inabilility to distinguish between men and women. [ ] The age, the intellectual attainments and the style of dress of the Countess would make [that] a pardonable error for anybody afflicted with poor sight but it is feared that the same cannot be said of other instances. (The Third Policeman, 1993 Edn., p.173-74.)\n\nMurder most foul: Liam OFlaherty, in his school-days, wrote a story of a farmer who murders his wife which he quoted in Shame the Devil (1934; 2nd. imp. 1939): He struck with his spade on the head many times, blaspheming joyously at each stroke, how she sank into the furrow, where she bled so profusely that the ensuing blows made her gore splash into her murderous husbands face. (Quoted in Patrick Sheeran, The Novels of Liam OFlaherty: A Study in Romantic Nationalism, UCG/NUI PhD Diss., 1972, p.54.) Cf. the murder with which The Third Policeman begins.\n\nAldous Huxley, Point Counterpoint (1928), Philip Quarles: Put a novelist into a novel. He justifies the aesthetic generalisations, which may be interesting - at least to me. He also justifies experiment. Specimens of his work may illustrate other possible or impossible ways of telling a story. And if you have him telling parts of the same story you are, you can make a variation on the theme. But why draw the line at one novelist inside your novel? Why not a second inside his? And a third inside the second novel? And so on to infinity, like those advertisements of Quaker Oats where theres a Quaker holding a box of oats on which is a picture of another Quaker holding another box of oats, &c., &c. At about the tenth remove you might have a novelist telling your story in algebraic symbols or in terms of variation in blood pressure, pulse, secretion of ductless glands, and reaction time. (NY Harper 1965 Edn., pp.301-02; quoted in Niall Fisher, ENG507 UUC 2002.)\n\nBashed about: OBriens Editorial Note to the James Joyce Special Issue of in Envoy (1951, pp.6-11) was reprinted by John Ryan A Bash in the Tunnel in his edited collection A Bash in the Tunnel: James Joyce by the Irish (1970, pp.15-20), with small variations, viz., in place of OBriens editorial words, I doubt whether the contents of this issue will get any of us any forrarder. / A little, perhaps. Mr. Cass seems to establish that Joyce was at heart an Irish dawn-bursting romantic, an admirer of de Valera [ ], Ryan has given: Some think that Joyce was at heart [... &c.] Again, where OBrien writes, This issue of ENVOY claims to be merely a small bit of that garden (Envoy, p.11), Ryan substitutes, All we can claim to know is merely a small bit of that garden. (A Bash [... &c.], p.20.)\n\nTomás Ó Criomhthain [OCrohan]: At the end of The Islandman, Ó Criomthain provides the original for the parody that OBrien produced in The Poor Mouth: [ ] to set down the character of the people about me so that some record of us might live after us, for the like of us will never be again.... that when I am gone men will know what life was like in my time and the neighbours that lived with me. Cf., Yes! I think that I shall never forget the Gaelic feis which we had in Corkadoragha. During the course of the feis many died whose likes will not be there again and, had the feis continued a week longer, no one would be alive now in Corkadoragha in all truth. (The Poor Mouth [An Beal Bocht], trans. Patrick C. Power, 1973; Picador 1975, p.61.) [See further, under Ó Criomhthain, infra.]\n\nTom Stoppard professed admiration for OBriens first novel, At Swim Two Birds in an early interview [with Giles Gordan, Transatlantic Review 29 (1968)], and there are clear signs that Lord Malquist and Mr. Moon, Stoppards only novel to date, was written under its influence. At Swim is about a student who writes a novel about a novelist who is eventually taken over and killed by his own characters; Stoppard - somewhat less ambitiously - writes about a latter-day Boswell (Moon) who is chronicling the day-to-day activities of his patron (Malquist) and is eventually killed by the repercussions of those activities. Besides this self-reflexiveness, the two novels share a predilection for ready-made characters, often of a bizarre kind, nigger skivvies in OBriens Dublin, a black Irish Jew in Stoppards London, and cowboys in both. (See Richard Corballis, Modernism and Postmodernism in Travesties, in Joycean Occasions, ed. Janet Dunleavy, 1991, p.163.)\n\nBlooming anxiety: The theory of anxiety of influence invoked by Seamus Deane and others to describe Flann OBriens relation to James Joyce takes its rise and definition from Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry (NY: OUP 1973). See Alex Davis, Irish Poetic Modernisms: A Reappraisal, in Critical Survey, 8, 2, 1996, pp.186-97; cited on Thomas MacGreevy Archive [online].\n\nImprobably Frequency, a musical farce by Arthur Riordan and Bell Helicopter (directed by Lynne Parker for Rough Magic) is set in Dublin 1941 and features Flann OBrien, Erwin Schrödinger, et al., among the dram. persona: As he seeks out the truth on Irish shores, Faraday is drawn in many different directions, his suspicions aroused with regard to just about everyone he meets. Why do the songs on ODromedarys popular radio show all seem to forecast the weather? Why does the lovely Philomena turn up everywhere theres trouble? Just what do the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger and the hack Myles na gCopaleen have to hide? [ ]. Note that the IRA-veteran is called Muldoon. (Dublin Th. Fest.,2004; see RTÉ Arts Online / October 2004 [link].)\n\nCheck names and dates of family members, chiefly brothers and wife; also, check family home at Avoca Tce. [all as supra], being at right angles to Avoca Rd., Blackrock and facing The Smoothing Iron (mentioned by Joyce in Finnegans Wake).\n\nRTÉ Arts Live edition on Flann OBrien (March 2006), produced by Liam Ó Muirthile, incls. contribs. from Anthony Cronin, Louis de Paor, Declan Kiberd, Alan Titley, Micheál Ó Nuallain (br.) and comic Tommy Tiernan; also an interview with Tim Pat Coogan and the film of the first Bloomsday recreation (1954) shot by John Ryan in which OBrien, Cronin, and Patrick Kavanagh took part. A conference was on 1st April organised at UCD by Jennika Pierie, with presentations from Joseph Brooker (Birbeck), Carol Taaffe (TCD), Gregory Dobbins (UC, Davis).\n\nCall For Papers: Reading Brian ONolans Libraries - The Parish Review\n\nOfficial Journal of the International Flann OBrien Society\n\nThe expanding field of Brian ONolan (Flann OBrien/Myles na gCopaleen) scholarship has undergone a remarkable transformation in the wake of the writers 2011 centenary. This renewed scholarly interest has given rise to a range of Cultural Materialist, Deconstructionist, and Genetic approaches, amongst others, that have explored the representation, and indeed the limits of, knowledge within ONolans oeuvre. His writing continues to resonate within the public sphere, as is attested by the many reissues, adaptations, and collections of his works, including the recent publication of his dramatic works and short stories by Dalkey Archive Press. As Flann OBrien (At Swim-Two-Birds, The Third Policeman) and Myles na gCopaleen (Cruiskeen Lawn, An Béal Bocht), ONolan is celebrated, in part, for his savage parodies of academic institutions, erudite individuals, and pedagogical methods; a reputation that appears to rest uneasily alongside this increasing scholarly attention.\n\nThe John Burns Library at Boston College acquired Brian ONolans papers and personal library in February 1997, yet a complete inventory of the latter has only just been compiled and published for the first time in the most recent issue of The Parish Review (2.1, Fall 2013), guest edited by Maebh Long. (A copy of the issue, including the full inventory, is available from the International Flann OBrien Society by contacting the general editors at viennacis.anglistik@univie.ac.at). This is an important and exciting resource for ONolan scholars: the library contains over four hundred books, periodicals, and newspapers in French, German, Greek, Irish, and Latin on subjects as diverse as archaeology, philosophy, politics, psychology, science, and theology. Additionally, there are literary texts from the Classical, Renaissance, Romantic, Victorian, and Modern periods. Due to the complexity of this collection, its potential as a resource for scholarship is only beginning to be examined.\n\nA forthcoming issue of The Parish Review (October 2014) will take up the question of how to assess Brian ONolans personal library, particularly in light of the representation of archives, marginalia, and scholarship across his oeuvre. We will encourage dialogue between frequently polarized critical approaches, asking which ONolan we might find between these shelves. Is ONolans work invigorated or exhausted by questions of influence? Does the representation of scholarship within his work mark a point of potential or resistance for archival approaches? What might be gathered from the annotations and marginalia within this wide-ranging collection of texts? Or should ONolan scholarship be spared from such lines of inquisition?\n\nThe editors invite proposals on any aspect of ONolans writing, but are especially interested in papers that explore the holdings at the Burns Library and/or investigate the wider epistemological issues that arise within his work. Potential topics for papers include, but are by no means limited to:\n\n• How models of influence are sustained by and/or undermined by\n\nONolans work\n\n• The complexities of ONolans national and intellectual contexts\n\n• The representation of libraries and/or scholarship within modernist\n\nand post-modernist texts\n\n• ONolans engagement with, or response to, specific literary movements\n\n• How emerging methodologies and technologies might inform our use and\n\nunderstanding of ONolans library.\n\nProposals of no more than 300 words should be submitted to theparishreview@gmail.com by 31 January 2014.
