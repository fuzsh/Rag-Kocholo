        "text": "I borrowed some wisdom from George Bernard Shaw, playwright and political activist (1856-1950).\n\n\"This is the true joy in life: Being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one, being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it what I can. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.\"\n\nShaw lived to be 94 years old, and he seemingly lived his purpose to its fullest.\n\nI noticed three important things about his philosophy that impressed me. No. 1 is that your purpose is a mighty one when it is recognized by you — not someone else. And that purpose uses you as its instrument. You can’t live someone else’s purpose, and only you can be the validator of your life.\n\nIf your passion is gardening, then bringing beauty into the world is a force of nature. Likewise, if your purpose is to find a cure for cancer, your passion is mighty, even if it fails in your lifetime. No one else gets to vote.\n\nNo. 2 is that the downward path of age is to become self-absorbed. If we’re not careful, our aches and pains gain the place of priority. We get so busy with doctor’s appointments and medical needs we forget that we have a purpose greater than our frailty.\n\nMy mother’s daily prayer after she had a mild stroke at 90 years old was, “Lord, I’m ready to leave this world, but if you have anything for me to do this day, I’m willing to do it.”\n\nMy third observation is that we have heard the teaching that we are each a candle in life, and we need to shine and not put our candle under a basket. But what if we think of our life as a splendid torch that we’re holding for the moment that will be passed on?\n\nI love the idea that our life belongs to the whole community, and as long as we live, it is our privilege to do what we can.\n\nThink of the Olympic torch relay, where each person runs for a short distance and then passes the torch. It didn’t begin with you, and it won’t end with you; your purpose is part of the human race, and you can choose to burn brightly to the end of your run.\n\nIt is empowering to know that we are part of the whole. The piece you occupy is important, whether it is big or small. Who wants to be known as a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances?\n\nYou, my friend, are important to the whole community, no matter your age or your condition.\n\nFind Connie’s book, “Daily Cures: Wisdom for Healthy Aging,” at www.justnowoldenough.com."
