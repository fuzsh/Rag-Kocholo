        "text": "George Bernard Shaw was the first person ever to win a Nobel Prize (for literature) and an Oscar (for the screenplay for Pygmalion, in 1938). As well as being a prolific writer and polymath, he was one of the first global celebrities who carefully created and managed his brand. Join award winning author and journalist Fintan O’Toole for a look at how Shaw became a master of self-invention, a nobody who captured the zeitgeist and one of the first private individuals to understand fully how to generate—and how to use—global fame."
