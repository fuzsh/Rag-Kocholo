        "text": "George Bernard Shaw received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925 for his work. His plays include Man and Superman, Heartbreak House and Pygmalion, subsequently turned into the musical My Fair Lady.\n\nHe was one of LSE's founders and also a founder and devoted member of the Fabian Society. He was married to Charlotte Shaw, one of LSE's early benefactors.\n\nA great figure of the time, noted for his satire and verbal artistry, his reputation stems from his qualities as a playwright and the \"Shavian\" style and themes he developed in his work."
