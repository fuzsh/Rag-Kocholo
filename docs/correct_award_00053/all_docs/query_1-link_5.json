B. Yeats won in 1923.[2]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw was nominated seven times before he, in 1926, was awarded the 1925 prize.[3] Other nominated authors in 1925 and 1926 included Guglielmo Ferrero, Willem Kloos, Rudolf Maria Holzapfel, Georg Brandes, Thomas Hardy, Roberto Bracco, Johan Bojer, Olav Duun, Paul Ernst, Paul Sabatier, Arnold Bennett, Paul Claudel, Kostis Palamas, Vicente Huidobro, Grazia Deledda (awarded in 1926), Sigrid Undset (awarded in 1928) and Johannes V. Jensen (awarded in 1944).[4][5]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nAt first, Shaw declined the prize stating \"I can forgive Nobel for inventing dynamite, but only a fiend in human form could have invented the Nobel prize\". He later changed his mind and accepted the honour, but refused to receive the prize money.[2][6]\n\nShaw recommended that the prize money instead used to fund the translation of works by Swedish playwright, August Strindberg, to English.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
