        "text": "George Bernard Shaw\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin and moved to London in 1876, where he established himself as a leading music and theater critic, novelist and playwright. An ardent socialist, he fought for equal rights for men and women and against the exploitation of the working class. Most of his writings examine these injustices. In addition to Candida, his major plays (he wrote over 50) include The Doctor's Dilemma, You Never Can Tell, Mrs. Warren's Profession, The Devil's Disciple, Caesar and Cleopatra, Misalliance, Man and Superman, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion, Pygmalion, Heartbreak House and Saint Joan. Shaw received the 1925 Nobel Prize for Literature and an Academy Award for the screenplay of Pygmalion in l938. The most comprehensive current biography of Shaw is Michael Holroyd's four-volume biography Bernard Shaw."
