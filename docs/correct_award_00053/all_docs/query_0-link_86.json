        "text": "George Bernard Shaw is revered as a distinguished playwright in the theatre world. Having composed more than 60 plays, Shaw’s reputation is unparalleled. He is the only person in history to be award both the Nobel Prize in Literature as well as an Academy Award.\n\nHowever, very few are away that Shaw’s was constantly making changes to his plays. The evolution of his first play, Widowers’ House, displays the improvement and development of Shaw as a playwright that would eventually lead him to be recognized as one of the greats. In “Shaw Improves Shaw” from Modern Drama 6.1 (1963), Bernard F. Dukore sheds a light on the evolution and revisions Shaw made to his plays. He devotes special attention to Charles H. Shattuck’s comparison of the 1893 and 1898 editions of Widowers’ House. Take a look and see George Bernard Shaw’s prodigious growth first-hand!"
