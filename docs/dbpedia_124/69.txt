The Caesar Cipher is a type of shift cipher. Shift Ciphers work by using the modulo operator to encrypt and decrypt messages. The Shift Cipher has a key K, which is an integer from 0 to 25. We will only share this key with people that we want to see our message.

For every letter in the message M :

1. Convert the letter into the number that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0, and call this number X.

( A=0, B=1, C=2, ...,Y=24, Z=25)

3. Convert the number Y into a letter that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0.

(A=0, B=1, C=2, ...,Y=24, Z=25)

For Example: We agree with our friend to use the Shift Cipher with key K=19 for our message.

We encrypt the message "KHAN", as follows:â€‹

So, after applying the Shift Cipher with key K=19 our message text "KHAN" gave us cipher text "DATG".

We give the message "DATG" to our friend.

For every letter in the cipher text C :

1. Convert the letter into the number that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0, and call this number Y.

(A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Y=24, Z=25)

3. Convert the number X into a letter that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0.

(A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Y=24, Z=25)

Our friend now decodes the message using our agreed upon key K=19. As follows:

So, after decrypting the Shift Cipher with key K=19 our friend deciphers the cipher text "DATG" into the message text "KHAN".
