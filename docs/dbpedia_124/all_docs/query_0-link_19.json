        "text": "There are many different types of encryption The process of encoding data or a message so that it cannot be understood by anyone other than its intended recipient. In computer processing, encryption means that data can be stored and transmitted securely by the sending computer to the receiving computer. algorithmA sequence of logical instructions for carrying out a task. In computing, algorithms are needed to design computer programs.. They vary in complexity and how secure they are.\n\nA simple method of encryption requires the use of a technique known as the Caesar cipher. The technique was invented by Julius Caesar who lived from 100BC to 44BC. The cipher works by giving a number value to a key. Each plaintextAn unencrypted message. letter is replaced by a new letter - the one found at the original letter's position in the alphabet plus or minus the value of the key.\n\nCaesar ciphers are often shown using a Caesar cipher wheel diagram, to illustrate that when the end of the alphabet is reached it goes around again.\n\nToday, much more complicated algorithms are used to encrypt messages. The Caesar cipher is very easy to decrypt without the key as it is so simple.\n\nEncryption is of little use if unauthorised users know the key. They can use it to decrypt any message that is encrypted with that key.\n\nOne way around this issue is to use an algorithm that generates two keys - a public key and a private key.\n\nA public key can be given to anyone. Anyone can then use this key to encrypt a message. However, the public key cannot decrypt a message - only the second, private key can do that. So long as the private key is never given out, messages will stay safely encrypted.\n\nAn encryption method that uses public and private keys in this way is known as asymmetric encryption. There are a number of different asymmetric encryption algorithms that are in use."
