        "text": "Sending information over the internet is equivalent to writing a message on a postcard and sending it through the mail in that anyone in the post office (or internet service provider) can snoop on your private messages just by looking at it.\n\nSoftware programs called packet sniffers can let a user see any information that reaches their network card on their computer, and older networking equipment (hubs and coaxial networks) would naively broadcast all that information to everyone connected to it, with the assumption that each computer would just screen out any information that wasn't meant for it.\n\nThat hardware is less common now as more advanced (and faster) \"switches\" gradually replaced hubs. Switches are designed to only send the data to the intended computer. It is possible to fool a switch into sending the data to places it shouldn't go, but it requires that the eavesdropper actively tamper with the network, making it possible for them to be detected.\n\nEncoding and encrypting are often used interchangeably. I would say that encrypting is used when you want to prevent some people from understanding a message, while encoding is when you want to transform the message but for it still to be read.\n\nFor example a message in English might be encoded using Morse code so it could be transmitted more easily and efficiently. If you thought someone might be listening to the line, you could also encrypt the message, for example, by using a Caesar cypher.\n\nI suppose normally encoding would mean converting the form of the message, from text to binary numbers say. Whilst encrypting would not necessarily change the form, but convert from one set of letters to a different set. However, you can also create cyphers to convert text to numbers or something else that obscures the meaning.\n\nThere are things like the Navajo Wind Talkers that do similar things. However, modern code-breaking and linguistic analysis techniques can help still. In similar ways, we sometimes find ancient books in languages we don't know, and slowly analyze them to understand what they are saying.\n\nFor example, suppose that you can eavesdrop on a spy's communications, but don't know what the words mean. You get the local newspaper to put in a fake story that there will be no water the next week. Then, you see the spy write a message that includes the word \"kai\" several times, when he never used the word \"kai\" before. Now, you suspect that the word \"kai\" means \"water\". (The US did something similar in World War II, which helped the Allies turn the tide of the war; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway#Allied_code-breaking .)\n\nOne common mistake among early cryptographer enthusiasts is to make a new \"language\" that's just an old language with the letters changed. My friends and I used to pass notes in invented ciphers like that, just as practice breaking codes!\n\nIf you invent a language that's close to other human languages - such as if it has the same sentence structure as Sanskrit - then it becomes a lot easier to figure out how the language works."
