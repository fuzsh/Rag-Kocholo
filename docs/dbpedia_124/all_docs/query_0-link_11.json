        "text": "Formula for Encryption and Decryption\n\nLet us derive the encryption formula for Caesar Cipher Program in C. Firstly, for normal cases, if the key is represented by k and the character by ch, we add both to get the encrypted message.\n\nFor extreme cases, we need to start counting from the beginning if the count exceeds z, so we first try to find the shift. To do so, we subtract a, i.e., the initial character of the series of the alphabet. Now we take modulus % with 26, i.e., the number of alphabets. Lastly, we add a to get the final answer.\n\nSo, our formula becomes (ch - 'a' + key) % 26 + 'a'.\n\nSimilarly, instead of adding the key, we subtract it for decryption. Now, there is the possibility of getting a negative answer here during subtraction. So, we add 26, and the formula becomes (ch - 'a' - key + 26) % 26 + 'a'.\n\nIn the same manner for capital letters and numbers, the formulae are:\n\nCategoryEncryptionDecryptionSmall Letters(ch - 'a' + key) % 26 + 'a'(ch - 'a' - key + 26) % 26 + 'a'Capital Letters(ch - 'A' + key) % 26 + 'A'(ch - 'A' - key + 26) % 26 + 'A'Digits(ch - '0' + key) % 10 + '0'(ch - '0' - key + 10) % 10 + '0'\n\nLet's see an example of a message consisting of only digits, encryption, and decryption. The ASCII codes for all the digits are given below:\n\n012345678948495051525354555657\n\nLet the message be 7930 and the key be 4.\n\nCodeASCII value (x)x+keyx-'0' (x-48)x%10x+'0'Encoded Character755591114919576113351335155775570485244524\n\nSimilarly, decoding can be performed for 1374 to return the original message.\n\nCodeASCII value (x)x-keyx-'0' (x-48)x+10x%10x+'0'Decoded Character14945-37749735147-199519755513133553452480100520\n\nThus, using formulae, i.e., Ceaser Cipher's method, we can encode the message safely, send it, and decode it by only authorized users.\n\nProgram for Caesar Cipher in C\n\nCaesar Cipher Encryption (Explain, Syntax & Output)\n\nThe Caesar Cipher Program in C can be applied as given below. We will check each character one by one to see if it is a lowercase character, an uppercase character, or a digit. We have an above-derived formula for each of them which we can use to encrypt as per the key given by the user.\n\nApply the above-derived formulae for each category. If the given character is an alphanumeric value, only we try encoding it. Else we print an error message.\n\nOutput:\n\nWe first check if the character is alphanumeric using the isalnum() method, which returns true if the given character is an alphanumeric value, i.e., either lowercase or uppercase alphabets or numbers. Then we check if the character is lowercase, uppercase, or a number using islower(), isupper(), and isdigit(), respectively. Accordingly, conversion is processed. Lastly, the encrypted character is added to the text at its position.\n\nCaesar Cipher Decryption (Explain, Syntax & Output)\n\nSimilarly, we can write Caesar Cipher Program in C for decoding. Instead of adding the key subtract it and add 26 so that we don't get a negative value as our answer.\n\nOutput:\n\nThe example above returns the value we inserted to encode in the above encoding C code in the previous section."
