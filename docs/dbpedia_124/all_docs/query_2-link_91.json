        "text": "Our CryptoAuthentication™ devices offer hardware-based secure storage to effectively keep secret keys hidden from unauthorized users. These small, very-low-power devices work with any microcontroller (MCU) or microprocessor (MPU) to provide flexible solutions for securing Internet of Things (IoT) nodes used in home automation, medical devices, wearables and many other applications. They can also be used to protect the authenticity of consumables/disposables and accessories, ensuring that only legitimate ones work with your product and preserving your revenue stream.\n\nThe optimized architecture of our CryptoAuthentication ICs is composed of hardware-based cryptographic accelerators to significantly reduce execution time and power consumption. A high-quality random number generator and EEPROM-based secure key storage are also embedded inside these devices. To provide extra security, they also come with physical anti-tampering and side-channel attack protections to block access to embedded system credentials.\n\nDesigned to work with CryptoAuthentication devices such as the ATECC608, ATSHA204A, ECC204, ECC206, SHA104, SHA105, SHA106, TA010 (automotive qualified) or ATSHA206A and to simplify your development, the CryptoAuthLib is a software support library written in C code. It is a component of any application or device driver that requires crypto services from CryptoAuthentication devices. It works on a variety of platforms including Arm® Cortex®-M based or PIC® microcontrollers and on PCs running the Windows® operating system or an embedded Linux® platform."
