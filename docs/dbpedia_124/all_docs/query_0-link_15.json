        "text": "The Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by another letter located a little further in the alphabet (therefore shifted but always the same for given cipher message).\n\nThe shift distance is chosen by a number called the offset, which can be right (A to B) or left (B to A).\n\nFor every shift to the right (of +N), there is an equivalent shift to the left (of 26-N) because the alphabet rotates on itself, the Caesar code is therefore sometimes called a rotation cipher.\n\nEncryption with Caesar code is based on an alphabet shift. The most commonly used shift/offset is by 3 letters such that A becomes D.\n\nPlain AlphabetABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZCaesar Alphabet (ðŸ œ3)DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC\n\nExample: Crypt DCODEX with a shift of 3.\n\nTo encrypt D, take the alphabet and look 3 letters after: G. So D is encrypted with G.\n\nTo encrypt X, loop the alphabet: after X : Y, after Y : Z, after Z : A. So X is coded A.\n\nDCODEX is coded GFRGHA\n\nAnother way to crypt, more mathematical, is to encode any letter x by (x+3) mod 26.\n\nNote A=0, B=1, â€¦, Z=25, and add a constant (the shift), then the result modulo 26 (alphabet length) is the coded text.\n\nExample: To crypt D (of value 3), add the shift 3: 3+3=6 and find the letter for 6 : 6=G, so D is crypted with G.\n\nTo encrypt X=23, 23+3=26 and 26 mod 26 = 0, 0=A, so X is encrypted with A, etc.\n\nDCODEX is coded GFRGHA\n\nCaesar code decryption replaces a letter another with an inverse alphabet shift: a previous letter in the alphabet.\n\nExample: Decrypt GFRGHA with a shift of 3.\n\nTo decrypt G, take the alphabet and look 3 letters before: D. So G is decrypted with D.\n\nTo decrypt X, loop the alphabet: before A: Z, before Z: Y, before Y: X. So A is decrypted X.\n\nGFRGHA is decrypted DCODEX.\n\nAnother way to decrypt, more mathematical, note A=0, B=1, â€¦, Z=25, subtracts a constant (the shift), then the result modulo 26 (alphabet length) is the plain text.\n\nExample: Take G=6, subtract the shift 6-3=3 and 3=D, so G is decrypted with D\n\nTake A=0, 0-3=-3 and -3 mod 26 = 23, 23=X, so A is decrypted with X, etc.\n\nGFRGHA is decrypted DCODEX\n\nA message encoded with the Caesar cipher has constant shifts for each letter, so its frequency analysis diagram is shifted (by a number of letters equal to the shift).\n\nThe index of coincidence is equal to that of the plaintext (as with any substitution cipher).\n\nAny reference to Caesar, general and emperor of Rome, his contemporaries (Cicero, Brutus, Cleopatra), or more generally to antiquity and the Roman Empire are clues.\n\nAlso, the presence of keywords like Julius (Iulius/Ivlivs), Ave, Augustus, or a (Caesar) salad can remind us of the Caesar imperator.\n\nThe English pronunciation of Caesar is close to seizure.\n\nCaesar cipher is best known with a shift of 3, all other shifts are possible. Some shifts are known with other cipher names.\n\nAnother variant changes the alphabet and introduces digits for example.\n\nA Caesar cipher with an offset of N corresponds to an Affine cipher Ax+B with A=1 and B=N.\n\nCaesar is sometimes written Cesar (in French) or Ceaser (bad typography).\n\nCaesar cipher is applicable only to letters of the alphabet. There are, however, several solutions to crypt numbers:\n\nâ€” Write the numbers in Roman numerals, the numbers becoming letters, it is enough to encode them normally\n\nExample: Nine becomes IX which becomes LA with a shift of 3.\n\nâ€” Shift the numbers with the same shift as the letters.\n\nExample: 9 becomes 12 (shift of +3)\n\nâ€” Integrate numbers in the alphabet.\n\nExample: With the alphabet ABCDEF123, 21 becomes BA with an offset of 3.\n\nCaesar cipher is also known as Shift Cipher. This shifting property can be hidden in the name of Caesar variants, eg.:\n\nCD code, C = D, the shift is 1\n\nHello (LO) code, L = O, the shift is 3\n\nJail (JL) code, J = L, the shift is 2\n\nEllen (LN) code, L = N, the shift is 2\n\nCutie (QT) code, Q = T, the shift is 3\n\nEiffel (FL) code, F = L, the shift is 6\n\nWC code, W = C, the shift is 6\n\nEmpty (MT) code, M = T, the shift is 7\n\nBaden Powell (scoutism founder), B = P, the shift is 14\n\nAny (NE) code, N = E, the shift is 17\n\nSee You (CU) code, C = U, the shift is 18\n\nI See (IC) code, I = C, the shift is 20\n\nEasy (EZ) code, E = Z, the shift is 21\n\nCEASAR (with a wrong spelling) where E=A or A=E, the shift is either +4 or -4 (=22)\n\nAny 2-letter code that can give an association between a crypted char and the plain one (see gramograms)\n\nROT13 code, the shift is 13 and reversible\n\nROT5 code for digits, the shift is 5 and reversible\n\nROT47 code for ASCII printable characters, the shift is 47 and reversible\n\nMore generally ROT-N with N the shift, if N < 26 then the Latin alphabet is used, else it can be any other custom alphabet."
