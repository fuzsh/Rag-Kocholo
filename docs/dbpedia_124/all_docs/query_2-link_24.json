        "text": "Encryption is a form of data security in which information is converted to ciphertext. Only authorized people who have the key can decipher the code and access the original plaintext information.\n\nIn even simpler terms, encryption is a way to render data unreadable to an unauthorized party. This serves to thwart cybercriminals, who may have used quite sophisticated means to gain access to a corporate network—only to find out that the data is unreadable and therefore useless.\n\nEncryption not only ensures the confidentiality of data or messages but it also provides authentication and integrity, proving that the underlying data or messages have not been altered in any way from their original state.\n\nOriginal information, or plain text, might be something as simple as \"Hello, world!\" As cipher text, this might appear as something confusing like 7*#0+gvU2x—something seemingly random or unrelated to the original plaintext.\n\nEncryption, however, is a logical process, whereby the party receiving the encrypted data—but also in possession of the key—can simply decrypt the data and turn it back into plaintext.\n\nFor decades, attackers have tried by brute force—essentially, by trying over and over again—to figure out such keys. Cybercriminals increasingly have access to stronger computing power such that sometimes, when vulnerabilities exist, they are able to gain access.\n\nData needs to be encrypted when it is in two different states: \"at rest,\" when it is stored, such as in a database; or \"in transit,\" while it is being accessed or transmitted between parties.\n\nAn encryption algorithm is a mathematical formula used to transform plaintext (data) into ciphertext. An algorithm will use the key to alter the data in a predictable way. Even though the encrypted data appears to be random, it can actually be turned back into plaintext by using the key again. Some commonly used encryption algorithms include Blowfish, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4), RC5, RC6, Data Encryption Standard (DES), and Twofish.\n\nEncryption has evolved over time, from a protocol that was used only by governments for top-secret operations to an everyday must-have for organizations to ensure the security and privacy of their data.\n\nAlso known as public key cryptography, asymmetric encryption is a relatively new method that uses two different but related keys to encrypt and decrypt data. One key is secret and one key is public. The public key is used to encrypt data, and the private key is used to decrypt (and vice versa). Security of the public key is not needed because it is publicly available and can be shared over the internet.\n\nAsymmetric encryption presents a much stronger option for ensuring the security of information transmitted over the internet. Websites are secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. A query to a web server sends back a copy of the digital certificate, and a public key can be extracted from that certificate, while the private key stays private.\n\nAttackers will still attack even when they know that data or devices are encrypted. They figure that with some effort, they might get through. For many years, weak passwords served as the impetus for attackers to keep trying, as some sophisticated software could sooner or later figure out passwords.\n\nSuch brute force attacks have become more sophisticated, as attackers hope that by making thousands or even millions of guesses, they will figure out the key for decryption. However, most modern encryption methods, coupled with multi-factor authentication (MFA), are helping organizations to become more resistant to brute force attacks."
