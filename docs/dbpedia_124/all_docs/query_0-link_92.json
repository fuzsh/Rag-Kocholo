        "text": "RSA Authentication:\n\nThere are reports that servers using the RSA authentication algorithm with keys longer than 3072-bit may experience heavy performance issues leading to connection timeouts and even service unavailability if many clients open simultaneous connections.\n\nCipher Block Chaining:\n\nIn 2013, researchers demonstrated a timing attack against several TLS implementations using the CBC encryption algorithm (see isg.rhul.ac.uk). Additionally, the CBC mode is vulnerable to plain-text attacks in TLS 1.0, SSL 3.0 and lower. A fix has been introduced with TLS 1.2 in form of the GCM mode which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack. GCM should be preferred over CBC."
