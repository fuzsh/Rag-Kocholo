        "text": "For most kinds of tasks and challenges, traditional computers are expected to remain the best solution. But when scientists and engineers encounter certain very complex problems, that’s where quantum comes into play. For these types of difficult calculations, even the most powerful supercomputers (big machines with thousands of traditional cores and processors) pale in comparison to quantum computing’s power. That’s because even supercomputers are binary code-based machines reliant on 20th-century transistor technology. Classical computers are simply unable to process such complex problems.\n\nComplex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways. Modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem, because of all the different electrons interacting with one another. Identifying new physics in a supercollider is also a complex problem. There are some complex problems that we do not know how to solve with classical computers at any scale.\n\nA classical computer might be great at difficult tasks like sorting through a big database of molecules. But it struggles to solve more complex problems, like simulating how those molecules behave. Today, if scientists want to know how a molecule will behave, they must synthesize it and experiment with it in the real world. If they want to know how a slight tweak would impact its behavior, they usually need to synthesize the new version and run their experiment all over again. This is an expensive, time-consuming process that impedes progress in fields as diverse as medicine and semiconductor design.\n\nA classical supercomputer might try to simulate molecular behavior with brute force, by using its many processors to explore every possible way every part of the molecule might behave. But as it moves past the simplest, most straightforward molecules available, the supercomputer stalls. No computer has the working memory to handle all the possible permutations of molecular behavior by using any known methods.\n\nQuantum algorithms take a new approach to these sorts of complex problems—creating multidimensional computational spaces or running calculations that behave much like these molecules themselves. This turns out to be a much more efficient way of solving complex problems like chemical simulations.\n\nEngineering firms, financial institutions and global shipping companies—among others—are exploring use cases where quantum computers could solve important problems in their fields. An explosion of benefits from quantum research and development is taking shape on the horizon. As quantum hardware scales and quantum algorithms advance, many big, important problems like molecular simulation should find solutions.\n\nToday, companies like IBM make real quantum hardware—a tool that scientists only began to imagine three decades ago—available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Engineers are delivering ever-more-powerful superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration. This work drives toward the quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.\n\nNow that the field has achieved quantum utility, researchers are hard at work to make quantum computers even more useful. Researchers at IBM Quantum and elsewhere have identified some key challenges to improve upon quantum utility and potentially achieve quantum advantage:\n\nScaling quantum processors: While qubit processors used in quantum computing have the potential to massively outperform bit-based processors, current quantum processors can only support a small number of potential qubits. As research progresses, IBM plans to introduce a quantum system with 200 logical qubits capable of running 100 million quantum gates by 2029, with a goal of two thousand logical qubits capable of running 1 billion gates by 2033.\n\nScaling quantum hardware: Although powerful, qubits are also quite error-prone, requiring large cooling systems capable of creating temperatures lower than outer space. Researchers are currently developing ways to scale qubits, electronics, infrastructure and software to reduce footprint, cost and energy usage.\n\nQuantum error correction: Decoherence, the process in which qubits fail to function properly and produce inaccurate results, is a major hurdle for any quantum system. Quantum error correction requires that we encode quantum information into more qubits than we would otherwise need. In 2024, IBM announced a landmark new error-correcting code about 10 times more efficient than prior methods. While error correction is not a solved problem, this new code marks a clear path toward running quantum circuits with a billion logic gates or more.\n\nQuantum algorithm discovery: Quantum advantage requires two components. The first is viable quantum circuits, and the second is a means to demonstrate that those quantum circuits are actually the best way to solve a quantum problem over any other state-of-the-art method. Quantum algorithm discovery is what will take current quantum technologies from quantum utility to quantum advantage.\n\nQuantum software and middleware: The crux of quantum algorithm discovery relies on a highly performant and stable software stack to write, optimize and execute quantum programs. Open-source and Python-based, IBM’s Qiskit is by far the most widely-used quantum SDK in the world—useful for executions both on IBM’s fleet of superconducting quantum computers and on systems that use alternative technologies such as ions trapped in magnetic fields or quantum annealing.\n\nQuantum-centric supercomputing: For the foreseeable future, quantum computing will work in tandem with modern and future classical supercomputing to be useful. In response, quantum researchers are preparing for a world where classical supercomputers can use quantum circuits to help solve problems.\n\nResearch continues improving quantum hardware components, but that’s only one half of the equation. The crux of users’ discovery of quantum advantage will be a highly performant and stable quantum software stack to enable the next generation of quantum algorithms.\n\nIn 2024, IBM introduced the first stable version of the Qiskit open source software development kit (SDK), Qiskit SDK 1.x. With over 600,000 registered users and 700 global universities that use it to develop quantum computing classes, Qiskit has become the preferred software stack for quantum computing.\n\nBut Qiskit is more than just the world’s most popular quantum development software to build and construct quantum circuits. We are redefining Qiskit to represent the full-stack software for quantum at IBM, extending the Qiskit SDK with middleware software and services to write, optimize and run programs on IBM Quantum systems—including new generative AI code-assistance tools."
