        "text": "Computers can do amazing things — from basic laptops capable of simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly complex supercomputers completing millions of financial transactions a day, controlling the infrastructure that makes modern life possible. But no computer can do anything until a computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. That’s what computer programming is all about.\n\nAt its core, computer programming is little more than a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. Based on the requirements or purposes of these instructions, computer programming can be as simple as adding two numbers. But, it can also be as complex as reading data from temperature sensors to adjust a thermostat, sorting data to complete intricate scheduling or critical reports or taking players through multi-layered worlds and challenges in games.\n\nDr. Cheryl Frederick, executive director of STEM programs at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), said computer programming is a collaborative process, with a variety of programmers contributing during the development of a piece of software. Some of that development can last decades. For software like Microsoft Word released in 1983, for instance, programmers have been tweaking and improving it for years.\n\n\"The hope is that the computer program will become such a widely adopted system that it needs long-term support, particularly to extend its current functionality,\" Frederick said. \"The terms computer software and computer programming are used interchangeably except software can get rather large.\"\n\nWhat Does a Computer Programmer Do?\n\nComputer programmers create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). They use specialized languages to communicate with computers, applications and other systems to get computers and computer networks to perform a set of specific tasks.\n\nBLS reported that computer programmers may do the following:\n\nCreate, modify and test code and scripts in software\n\nTest programs for errors and fix the faulty lines of code\n\nUpdate and expand existing programs\n\nWrite programs in languages such as C++ and Java\n\nWhat Are 3 Skills a Computer Programmer Should Have?\n\nO*NET Online reported some of the skills that computer programmers need, include:\n\nCritical thinking - use logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and weakness of solutions, conclusions and approaches to problems\n\nSpeaking - talk to others to convey information effectively\n\nTime management - manage your time and the time of others\n\nHow to Become a Computer Programmer\n\nMany computer programmers begin as self-taught enthusiasts, and a persistent interest in programming can be an asset in your career because continued learning is vital to a computer programmer.\n\nIn 2023, the median salary for computer programmers was $99,700, according to BLS, and to enter the field a bachelor's degree is typically required.*\n\n\"Getting a degree is a good way to get started in a career, and it gives you a foundation to organize your experiences,\" said Dr. Curtis George, associate dean of information technology programs at SNHU. \"Ultimately though it's the experience that makes you a great programmer. In addition to having experience, a successful programmer always keeps up with the latest computer languages, algorithm processes and software industry trends.\"\n\nFrederick agreed. She held jobs with the Department of Defense and in the financial and telecommunications sectors before turning to education.\n\n“It takes a lot of grit and it’s not enough to earn a degree; you need workplace experience,” she said. “We give students a foundation — based on data structures, algorithms, math and logical engineering — but you have to be able to plan, write, design, test and manage software. You have to know at least two or three programming languages, including proficiency in JAVA and C++.”\n\nBeyond classroom and experiential learning, however, computer programmers must understand that when writing a program, it never works the first time.\n\n“This field requires patience, and the ability to troubleshoot and get at errors. You need to be a learning worker, be self-disciplined, have the motivation to learn on your own, be able to brainstorm with others, and have a lot of hands-on practice,” Frederick said. “You must be a practitioner and adapt to what’s trending.”\n\nWhile working to complete a computer science degree, students are encouraged to create a portfolio of their software work.\n\n“Though this portfolio isn’t graded, students can share it with potential employers as proof of coding capabilities,” Frederick said. “The entire degree program gives students broad exposure and proficiencies in traditional and trending technologies, including such specialties as computation graphics, software testing and writing code for commonly used programs, as well as deeper, more specific skills.”\n\nRecent graduate Paloma Rodriguez '24, from Tacoma, Washington, took advantage of tuition benefits offered by her employer to earn her bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in software engineering.\n\nDespite not initially seeing herself as a \"math\" or \"science\" student, she found support throughout her studies, which boosted her confidence. SNHU helped her feel like \"I can do this,\" she said.\n\nPreviously working as a licensed insurance agent, Rodriguez is now embarking on a new chapter in her career. She recently accepted an offer to become a software developer, preparing to put her knowledge and skills to use in the tech industry."
