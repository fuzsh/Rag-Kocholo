        "text": "If the original message was shifted by 1,2,3, or 4 to result in \"pdwk lv ixq\", then to get back to the original message, we must shift the decrypted message backward by 1,2,3, or 4 steps. We can think of this as shifting it forward by \\(26-1 = 25\\), \\(26-2 = 24\\), \\(26-3 = 23\\), or \\(26-4 = 22\\) steps. For example, if we encrypted an \"a\" and got a \"b\", to decrypt the \"b\" to get back the \"a\", we need to shift \"b\" by 25 steps.\n\nHere is a table showing the first 4 shifts of the alphabet.\n\nHere is a table showing the message decrypted using each shift\n\nEncrypted message: pdwk lv ixq\n\nWhich of these decodings looks correct? The shift of 23 is the only shift that gives a resulting message in English. If the message \"math is fun\" is encoded with a shift of three, it is easy to check that it becomes \"pdwk lv ixq\" and so we use a forward shift of \\(26-3\\) to take in \"pdwk lv ixq\" and output \"math is fun\"."
