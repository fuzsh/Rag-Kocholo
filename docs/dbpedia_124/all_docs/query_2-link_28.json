        "text": "What is public key cryptography?\n\nPublic key cryptography is a method of encrypting or signing data with two different keys and making one of the keys, the public key, available for anyone to use. The other key is known as the private key. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. Because of this use of two keys instead of one, public key cryptography is also known as asymmetric cryptography. It is widely used, especially for TLS/SSL, which makes HTTPS possible.\n\nWhat is a cryptographic key?\n\nIn cryptography, a key is a piece of information used for scrambling data so that it appears random; often it's a large number, or string of numbers and letters. When unencrypted data, also called plaintext, is put into a cryptographic algorithm using the key, the plaintext comes out the other side as random-looking data. However, anyone with the right key for decrypting the data can put it back into plaintext form.\n\nFor example, suppose we take a plaintext message, \"hello,\" and encrypt it with a key; let's say the key is \"2jd8932kd8.\" Encrypted with this key, our simple \"hello\" now reads \"X5xJCSycg14=\", which seems like random garbage data. However, by decrypting it with that same key, we get \"hello\" back.\n\nPlaintext + key = ciphertext:\n\nhello + 2jd8932kd8 = X5xJCSycg14=\n\nCiphertext + key = plaintext:\n\nX5xJCSycg14= + 2jd8932kd8 = hello\n\nThis is an example of symmetric cryptography, in which only one key is used. In public key cryptography, there would instead be two keys. The public key would encrypt the data, and the private key would decrypt it.\n\nHow does TLS/SSL use public key cryptography?\n\nPublic key cryptography is extremely useful for establishing secure communications over the Internet (via HTTPS). A website's SSL/TLS certificate, which is shared publicly, contains the public key, and the private key is installed on the origin server â€” it's \"owned\" by the website."
