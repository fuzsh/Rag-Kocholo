        "text": "A cryptographic key transforms plain text into cipher text, then back into plain text. Cryptographic keys are random strings of random characters put in a particular order.\n\nThe purpose of cryptographic keys is to alter data to protect it from theft. You can call it encrypting, altering, transforming, or scrambling; all of these are accurate descriptors. The idea is that you turn plain text (normally code) into decipherable gibberish, at least in the eyes of anyone trying to steal or intercept it.\n\nWithout the key, a viewer can’t understand what they’re looking at. Naturally, this offers many cybersecurity benefits. Preventing fraud, intellectual property theft, and reverse engineering are among the most important benefits. That’s why cryptographic keys are ubiquitous parts of most people’s lives, whether or not they realize it.\n\nCryptographic keys can be produced and used in several ways. Let’s go over those types of cryptographic keys, the science behind them, and their applications and importance.\n\nSymmetric keys enable symmetric encryption. That means that the keys for encryption and decryption are the same. You use one key to lock and unlock the same thing.\n\nThis is a very simple type of cryptographic encryption, but it’s sufficient in many scenarios. Symmetric keys are suitable when speed is of the essence and security risks are low. Data can be encrypted and decrypted faster and with fewer opportunities for confusion.\n\nTwo of the many use cases for symmetric keys include securing data at rest or quickly encrypting large volumes of data temporarily. However, relying on symmetric keys for too long may induce a false feeling of security.\n\nKey generation algorithms are mathematical processes that create secure cryptographic keys for encryption, decryption, or both.\n\nSymmetric keys require algorithms to create secure, random numbers. It’s essentially a random number generator, providing one number for both encryption and decryption. You can think of it as a roll of the dice, except the dice have effectively limitless surfaces—and there are many dice.\n\nWith asymmetric key generation, a pair of keys is generated. One is private, and the other is public. The private key is kept secret and is only used to decrypt data that was encrypted with the public key. In these cases, the public key can be shared without risk.\n\nThe key generation described above follows the importance of randomness in cryptography theory. To keep the key generation truly random, generators rely on sources of entropy. These are either:\n\nRandom Number Generators (RNGs)\n\nPseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)\n\nHardware-based entropy can come in the form of replicating physical sources such as mouse movements or other electric signals. Software-based entropy comes from random data collected from OS data, like network packets or keystrokes.\n\nIn general, the more entropy that goes into key generation, the more secure the keys will be.\n\nOf the two, PRNGs are less truly random. (Thus the “pseudo” before the RNG.) Computers are deterministic machines and therefore cannot be truly random. Instead, PRNGs are initialized with an entropy source, but they aren’t entirely randomized because they’re determined by an initial seed, and their keys are therefore relegated to a smaller selection.\n\nSome popular examples of past and present symmetric encryption algorithms are:\n\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n\nData Encryption Standard (DES)\n\nInternational Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)\n\nBlowfish & TwoFish\n\nRC6\n\nAES is the most popular symmetric encryption algorithm used today. It was developed as a replacement for DES, which was cracked back in 2005. AES has stood up to the test of time thus far. Compared to DES, it offers much longer encryption keys, so it rarely fails against brute-force attacks.\n\nBlowfish and its more modern version, TwoFish, are also successors to DES. They’re both block ciphers like AES, but with longer key lengths (32 bits to 448 bits for Blowfish and 128 bits to 256 bits for TwoFish).\n\nThe most common past and present asymmetric encryption algorithms are:\n\nRivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)\n\nDiffie-Hellman\n\nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)\n\nRSA is the oldest of these algorithms, developed in 1977. It uses factorization of the product of two prime numbers to deliver encryption ranging from 1024 bits to 2048 bits. It’s a powerful method, with its main drawback being the demands of that power. That is, it offers one of the slowest decryption processes, but that slowness comes with an incomparable level of security.\n\nAn ECC curve can potentially reach an even more powerful level of encryption, up to 15,360 bits. It’s more widely considered to be the future of encryption.\n\nEven with the best practices observed, you stand a chance of attack or even accidental exposure.\n\nKey revocation and rotation backup plans must be in place to handle these threats, which may arise at a moment’s notice.\n\nRegularly rotating keys and revoking compromised keys limits the possible attack surface. In other words, this presents a smaller window of opportunity in which attackers could take advantage of vulnerabilities. Key rotation is thus one of the few ongoing measures that can protect data and communications over time.\n\nCryptographic keys are a big part of cybersecurity. Applications people use normally take advantage of them in a way that most users can’t see or understand. Nevertheless, those who offer applications to end users must understand the best practices to ensure that information is only accessed by intended recipients.\n\nCryptographic keys are a crucial part of data security. They prevent interception, MITM attacks, and brute-force attacks.\n\nTo enhance your security, audit your own cryptographic key processes. Test their security with penetration testing and look into ways to further secure your communication. No matter how secure your data is, you should always strive to make it safer from cyberattacks."
