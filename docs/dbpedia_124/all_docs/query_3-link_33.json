        "text": "Why should we care about encryption?\n\nEvery time we make a purchase online, use the bank ATM, text or call somebody, encryption keeps the transaction or communication private and highly secure. Encryption provides a layer of security so information is only accessed by the authorized users. It has become an essential part of our modern day lives. We should care about encryption as it provides privacy, security, integrity of data, and authentication. In many cases it is required for regulatory compliance.\n\nWhat encryption algorithms should I use?\n\nThis is a complicated question to answer. When deciding on an encryption algorithm, it is important to consider these questions:\n\nIs this algorithm up to date?\n\nHas this algorithm been through a validation process?\n\nDoes the OS, application, or hardware support the encryption?\n\nIf any question cannot be answered in the affirmative, either a new algorithm should be chosen or more research should be done.\n\nBecause encryption is a constantly changing field, these decisions can be difficult. However, it is important to understand that encryption is very important to security. Making decisions based on partial knowledge about encryption can be dangerous. If you don't fully understand encryption, make sure you are using crypto designed and built by someone who does understand."
