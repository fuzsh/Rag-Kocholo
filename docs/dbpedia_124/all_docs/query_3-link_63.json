Our algorithms have a number of benefits: (1) the encryption has properties similar to CBC mode, yet the encipherment and authentication can be parallelized and/or pipelined, (2) the authentication overhead is minimal, and (3) the authentication process remains resistant against some IV reuse. We offer a Manticore class of authenticated encryption algorithms based on cryptographic hash functions, which support variable block sizes up to twice the hash output length and variable key lengths. A proof of security is presented for the MTC4 and Pepper algorithms. We then generalize the construction to create the Cipher-State (CS) mode of encryption that uses the internal state of any round-based block cipher as an authenticator. We provide hardware and software performance estimates for all of our constructions and give a concrete example of the CS mode of encryption that uses AES as the encryption primitive and adds a small speed overhead (10-15%) compared to AES alone.},\n\ndoi = {10.2172/919631},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/919631}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004},\n\nmonth = {Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004}\n\n}"
