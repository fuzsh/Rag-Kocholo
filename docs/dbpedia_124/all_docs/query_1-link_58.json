        "text": "Ciphers, codes, and other encryption methods have been used throughout history by most civilizations in some form or other to prevent non-authorized people from understanding messages. They have increased in sophistication considerably throughout history and are commonly used today.\n\nThese 11 methods range from some of the earliest examples in history to some of the most advanced encryption techniques in history.\n\n1. The Caesar Shift Cipher Used By the Roman Army\n\nIts First Appearance: Unknown – Likely 1st Century AD\n\nWhere It Appeared: Roman Empire\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): Unknown – Likely between 5th and 9th Century AD\n\nThe cipher was named in honor of Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it to encrypt military and other official messages.\n\nAs the majority of Rome’s enemies were illiterate at this time, the cipher remained secure for a time. By the 9th Century AD, after the fall of Rome, records exist of methods to crack it using frequency analysis from Al-Kindi.\n\n2. Simple Scytale Cipher Used By The Spartans\n\nIts First Appearance: Ancient Greece – 7th Century BC\n\nWhere It Appeared: Classical/Ancient Greece/Sparta\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): Unknown – But known about by Plutarch (50-120AD)\n\nScytale was an ancient form of encryption commonly in ancient/classical Greece. It is a form of transposition cipher where letters are re-arranged in the messages before being deciphered by the recipient.\n\nThis method involved using a cylinder around which parchment was wrapped and the message written onto it. The recipient would read the message with a rod of the same dimensions.\n\nGiven its simplicity, it was easily decipherable by the enemy too.\n\n3. The Steganography Hiding Messages in Plain Sight\n\nIts First Appearance: Circa 440BC\n\nWhere It Appeared: Ancient Greece\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): Unknown\n\nSteganography is a method of hiding messages ‘in plain sight’ by camouflaging them as something else. The earliest recorded use of this form of ‘encryption’ was described by Herodotus in his Histories.\n\nHe describes how Histiaeus sent a message to his vassal, Aristagoras, by shaving the head of his most trusted servant, “marking” the message onto his scalp, and then letting the slave’s hair regrow. The slave was then sent to Aristagoras and ordered to shave his head again.\n\nThis method can also be used to hide files or other messages within other files or messages.\n\n4. The Pigpen Cipher Used by The Masons\n\nIts First Appearance: Unknown – Perhaps before 1531\n\nWhere It Appeared: Europe/Freemasons\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): Unknown\n\nThe Pigpen cipher, or Masonic or Freemason cipher, is a geometric simple substitution cipher. It uses symbols to encode the letters within a message.\n\nIt is encoded and decoded by producing a grid or set of grids to produce the subsequent symbols.\n\n5. Breaking The Enigma Code Significantly Shortened World War 2\n\nIts First Appearance: 1918-1920\n\nWhere It Appeared: Germany/Nazi Germany\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): It varies depending on the source – between 1941 and 1945\n\nThe term ‘Enigma Code’ is generally understood as the cipher device used by German forces during WW2 to encrypt their transmissions.\n\n[see-also]\n\nThe Germans invented Enigma machines towards the end of the First World War, which were then adopted by various militaries worldwide.\n\nDuring the Second World War, different military services developed encryption keys that would often be changed daily. As the Allies cracked the codes, the Axis forces would be forced to change them – only to have them cracked again.\n\nA primary example of this ‘code arms race’ was the different phases of German U-Boat ‘Wolf Packs’ success during the Battle for the Atlantic.\n\nThe brunt of the deciphering work was conducted by Polish code breakers and, famously, Alun Turing and his team at Bletchley Park with his Bombe Enigma cracking machine.\n\n6. The Playfair Cipher With Pairs of Letters For Encryption\n\nIts First Appearance: 1854\n\nWhere It Appeared: England/United Kingdom\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): It was still in use during WW2 but gradually replaced from 1914 onwards.\n\nFirst developed by Charles Wheatstone in 1854, the Playfair Cipher was named after its promoter, Lord Playfair.\n\nThis form of encryption uses pairs of letters rather than single letters in simpler substitution ciphers, making it much harder to break.\n\n7. The Polyalphabetic Cipher Finally Bested Frequency Analysis\n\nIts First Appearance: 1467\n\nWhere It Appeared: Italy\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): Unknown\n\nUntil Leon Battista Alberti devised his polyalphabetic cipher in 1467, most ciphers could be solved using frequency analysis. His method uses various substitution sources for different parts of the message.\n\nThis marked the biggest improvement in cryptology since ancient times, earning him the title of “Father of Western Cryptology“. At least, according to David Khan.\n\n8. The Vigenère Cipher Should Be Called The Bellaso Cipher\n\nIts First Appearance: 1467\n\nWhere It Appeared: Italy\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): Decryption technique published in 1863\n\nThe Vigenère cipher is now widely accepted to have been created by Giovan Battista Bellaso (an Italian Cryptologist). It was later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th Century, hence its current name.\n\nIt encrypts text using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on a keyword. It is, therefore, a form of polyalphabetic substitution.\n\n9. The Data Encryption Standard Kicked Off Modern Cryptology Advancement\n\nIts First Appearance: 1970’s\n\nWhere It Appeared: IBM, The United States of America\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): It was replaced by AES in the early 21st Century\n\nThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) was devised by IBM (based on earlier work by Horst Feistel) during the 1970s. It is a symmetric key algorithm used for the encryption of electronic data.\n\n10. Public-Key Cryptography Was An Official Secret For 27 Years\n\nIts First Appearance: 1970\n\nWhere It Appeared: United Kingdom\n\nWhen It Was Cracked (if applicable): It was declassified in 1997\n\nPublic Key Cryptography was first conceived by James H. Ellis in 1970 whilst working as a cryptographer for the GCHQ – but he soon ran into problems trying to implement it. His work was improved upon in 1973 by Clifford Cocks, who developed the RSA encryption algorithm."
