        "text": "What Is a Code of Ethics?\n\nA code of ethics is a set of principles intended to guide professionals in conducting business with honesty and integrity. A code of ethics document may outline the organization’s mission and values, guide on addressing problems, establish ethical principles based on the organization’s core values, and define the standards to which professionals are held.\n\nTo evaluate corporate codes of ethics ethically, you must apply universal moral standards like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship to the stages of content, creation, implementation, and administration.\n\nAlso called an “ethical code,” a code of ethics may encompass areas such as business ethics, professional practices, and employee conduct.\n\nWhat Is the Purpose of a Code of Ethics?\n\nBusiness ethics refers to how ethical principles guide a business’s operations. Common issues that fall under the umbrella of business ethics include employer-employee relations, discrimination, environmental issues, bribery, insider trading, and social responsibility.\n\nAlthough many laws establish basic ethical standards for businesses, it’s primarily up to business leaders to develop a comprehensive code of ethics.\n\nEthical conduct has been shown to benefit an organization and society in the long term. It aligns with the triple bottom line theory of profit, people, and planet and meets the growing expectations of socially responsible customers, employees, and investors.\n\nBusinesses and trade organizations usually have a code of ethics that employees or members must follow. Violating this code can lead to termination or dismissal. A code of ethics is crucial because it clearly defines the rules for behavior and offers a basis for preemptive warnings.\n\nGiven the importance of climate change and the significant impact of human behavior, many companies now include climate factors in their code of ethics. These principles outline the company’s dedication to operating sustainably or their plans to shift toward sustainable practices.\n\nAlthough this commitment to sustainability can increase costs, it often proves worthwhile as consumers increasingly prefer to engage with environmentally responsible businesses, enhancing the company’s public image.\n\nRegardless of size, businesses count on their management staff to set ethical conduct standards for other employees. When leaders adhere to the code of ethics, universal compliance is expected, with no exceptions.\n\nTypes of Codes of Ethics\n\nA code of ethics can take various forms. Still, its general goal is to ensure that a business and its employees follow state and federal laws, conduct themselves according to exemplary standards, and benefit all stakeholders. Here are two types of codes of ethics commonly found in business.\n\nCompliance-Based Code of Ethics\n\nFor all businesses, laws regulate issues such as hiring and safety standards. Compliance-based codes of ethics set guidelines for conduct and determine penalties for violations.\n\nSpecific laws govern business conduct in industries like banking, leading these sectors to adopt compliance-based codes of ethics to enforce regulations. Employees typically undergo formal training to understand these rules. Noncompliance can create legal issues for the company, and individual employees may face penalties for failing to follow guidelines.\n\nSome companies appoint a compliance officer to ensure adherence to the code of ethics. This individual stays updated on regulatory changes and monitors employee conduct to encourage conformity.\n\nThis type of code of ethics is based on clear-cut rules and defined consequences rather than personal behavior monitoring. While it ensures legal compliance, it may not always promote a climate of moral responsibility within a company.\n\nValue-Based Code of Ethics\n\nA value-based code of ethics addresses a company’s core value system, setting standards of responsible conduct that benefit the larger public and the environment. These ethical codes often require more self-regulation than compliance-based codes.\n\nSome codes of conduct contain language that addresses both compliance and values. For example, a grocery store chain might create a code prioritizing health and safety regulations over financial gain. Additionally, the code might include a commitment to avoiding suppliers that use hormones in livestock or raise animals in inhumane conditions.\n\nCode of Ethics in Different Professions\n\nCertain professions, such as those in finance or health, have specific laws that mandate codes of ethics and conduct.\n\nAccountants\n\nCertified public accountants (CPAs), who are not typically considered fiduciaries to their clients, still are expected to follow similar ethical standards, such as integrity, objectivity, truthfulness, and avoidance of conflicts of interest, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n\nFinancial Advisers\n\nFinancial advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or a state regulator are bound by a code of ethics known as a fiduciary duty, a legal and ethical obligation requiring them to act in the best interest of their clients.\n\nCode of Ethics vs. Code of Conduct\n\nA code of ethics and a code of conduct both set professional standards to guide behavior of an organization’s members. However, there are some subtle differences:\n\nA code of ethics ensures that members exercise sound judgment. For example, legal codes prevent lawyers from handling conflict-of-interest cases or brokers from trading against clients.\n\nA code of conduct, meanwhile, specifies expected employee actions, including norms like punctuality and accuracy. Most companies implement an employee code of conduct to uphold professionalism and minimize workplace friction.\n\nHaving both a code of ethics and a code of conduct helps ensure that an organization operates with integrity and maintains professionalism with its employees.\n\nHow to Create a Code of Ethics\n\nOrganizations create codes of ethics to eliminate unacceptable or immoral behavior among their members, often focusing on existing ethical issues within their industry.\n\nThe first step is for an organization to identify its priorities and any ethical issues it wishes to avoid. For example, a company might want to prevent conflicts of interest due to past scandals. In that case, its code of ethics might prohibit inappropriate relationships or actions that could lead to a conflict of interest.\n\nWhat Is an Example of a Code of Ethics?\n\nMany firms and organizations have adopted a code of ethics. One good example comes from the CFA Institute (CFAI), the grantor of the chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation and creator of the CFA exams.\n\nCFA charterholders are among the most respected and globally recognized financial professionals. According to the CFAI’s website, members of the CFA Institute, including CFA charterholders, and candidates for the CFA designation must adhere to the following Code of Ethics:\n\nAct with integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and ethics when dealing with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.\n\nPlace the integrity of the investment profession and clients’ interests above their interests.\n\nUse reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.\n\nPractice and encourage others to practice professionally and ethically, which will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.\n\nPromote the integrity and viability of the global capital markets for the ultimate benefit of society.\n\nMaintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA code of ethics is a guiding set of principles intended to instruct professionals to act in a way that aligns with the organization’s values and benefits all stakeholders. A business’s code of ethics is drafted and tailored to the specific industry at hand, and it requires all business employees to adhere to it."
