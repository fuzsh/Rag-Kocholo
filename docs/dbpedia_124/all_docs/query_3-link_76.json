These interconnected systems can be the targets of serious threats and cyberattacks that jeopardize the availability, authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity of the information assets. Compromised networks, systems, or information can have adverse effects on business activities and may result in data breaches and financial loss.\n\nThis document aids technology practitioners in choosing and appropriately using cryptographic algorithms. When used with valid domain parameters and specific key lengths, the cryptographic algorithms listed in this document are recommended cryptographic mechanisms for protecting the authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity of sensitive UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECTED A, and PROTECTED B information to the medium injury level, as defined in the Cyber Centre’s IT Security Risk Management: A Lifecycle Approach (ITSG-33)Footnote 1. For requirements on the use of Cyber Centre approved cryptography to protect PROTECTED C and Classified information, contact the Cyber Centre by email at contact@cyber.gc.ca.\n\nThis document complements the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) Guideline on Defining Authentication RequirementsFootnote 2. Organizations are responsible for determining their security objectives and requirements as part of their risk management framework.\n\n1.1 Practitioner notes\n\nIn this document we make recommendations for cryptographic algorithms and parameters. We also list algorithms that should be “phased out” of use. New applications should not use these algorithms. Where these algorithms are used in existing applications, they should be replaced with algorithms that we recommend in this document. For certain algorithms we specify a date by which these algorithms should have been replaced. In other instances, these algorithms should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, when an algorithm requires a primitive, it should be chosen from those recommended in this document. For example, a hash function from Sections 6.2 or 6.3 should be used when using the Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) from Section 8.1. Unless otherwise specified, when an algorithm requires a parameter, it should be chosen from those recommended in the given reference for the algorithm.\n\n1.2 Policy drivers\n\nThe need to address and counter cyber threats and vulnerabilities currently threatening networks is a crucial step in securing networks, data, and assets. GC departments must ensure IT security policies and procedures are implemented in accordance with the TBS Policy on Government SecurityFootnote 3.\n\n1.3 Relationship to the IT risk management process\n\nThe Cyber Centre’s IT Security Risk Management: A Lifecycle Approach (ITSG-33)Footnote 1 guidelines suggest a set of activities at two levels within an organization: the departmental level and the information system level.\n\nLong description - IT Security risk management process\n\nThis figure describes the high-level departmental IT security risk management process and associated activities, as well as the information system security risk management activities. It also highlights how the IT security risk management activities at both levels act together in a continuous cycle to efficiently maintain and improve the security posture of departmental information systems.\n\nAt the departmental level, the IT security risk management activities conducted by the departmental security authorities (e.g. CSO, ITSC) include:\n\nDefine departmental IT security needs and security controls\n\nDeploy security controls\n\nMonitor and assess performance of security controls - maintain authorization\n\nIdentify security control updates\n\nThe key deliverables of the deploy security controls activity are departmental control profiles and departmental IT threat assessment reports. These deliverables are key inputs into the security risk management activities at the information system level.\n\nAt the information system level, the IT security risk management activities conducted by IT project managers, security practitioners and developers include:\n\nDefine IT security needs and security controls\n\nDesign and develop or acquire information system with security\n\nIntegrate, test, and install information system with security\n\nOperate, monitor, and maintain information systems with security\n\nSecurely dispose of IT assets at retirement\n\nInformation from the operations and maintenance activities provide feed back into the monitor and assess activity at the departmental level. The IT security performance feedback supports the maintain authorization activity under the monitor and assess.\n\nDepartmental-level activities are integrated into the organization’s security program to plan, manage, assess, and improve the management of IT security-related risks faced by the organization. Cryptographic algorithms should be considered during the define, deploy, and monitor and assess activities. These activities are described in detail in Annex 1 - Departmental IT security risk management activities (ITSG-33)Footnote 1.\n\nInformation system level activities are integrated into an information system lifecycle to ensure:\n\nIT security needs of supported business activities are met\n\nappropriate security controls are implemented and operating as intended\n\ncontinued performance of the implemented security controls is assessed, reported back, and acted upon to address any issues.\n\nCryptographic algorithms should be considered during all information system level activities. These activities are described in detail in Annex 2 - Information system security risk management activities (ITSG-33)Footnote 1.\n\n2 Encryption algorithms\n\nThe following section outlines the encryption algorithms that we recommend for protecting the confidentiality of UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECTED A, and PROTECTED B information. We also specify encryption algorithms that were recommended in a previous version of this document but should have been phased out by the end of 2023.\n\n2.1 Advanced encryption standard algorithm\n\nWe recommend the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm as specified in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Information Processing Standards Publication 197: Advanced Encryption StandardFootnote 4 with key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.\n\n2.2 Triple data encryption algorithm\n\nThe use of 3-key Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) should have been phased out by the end of 2023.\n\nWe no longer recommend the use of the TDEA specified in NIST SP 800-67 Revision 2: Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Block CipherFootnote 5. Legacy applications still using the 3-key option of TDEA should note the important restriction that one key bundle should not be used to encrypt more than 220 64-bit data blocks.\n\n2.3 CAST5\n\nThe use of CAST5 should have been phased out by the end of 2023.\n\nWe no longer recommend the CAST5 algorithm specified in Request for Comments (RFC) 2144: The CAST-128 Encryption AlgorithmFootnote 6.\n\n3 Encryption algorithm modes of operation\n\nThe following section outlines the encryption algorithm modes of operation that we recommend for use with the AES algorithm, as specified in Section 2.1.\n\n3.1 Protecting the confidentiality of information\n\nWe recommend the following block cipher modes of operation for protecting the confidentiality of UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECTED A, and PROTECTED B information, as specified in NIST SP 800-38A: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods and TechniquesFootnote 7:\n\n Electronic Codebook (ECB) – ECB mode is only suitable for situations where a single block of data is being encrypted or as specified in derived algorithms such as key wrapping (see Section 10). It should not be used for bulk data encryption\n\nCipher Feedback (CFB)\n\nOutput Feedback (OFB)\n\nCounter (CTR)\n\nCipher Block Chaining (CBC) - When using CBC mode with a plaintext input of bit length greater than or equal to the block size, a padding method must be used as described in Appendix A of SP800-38AFootnote 7. Protocols typically specify particular padding methods that may be used. If no padding method is specified, we recommend the following modes from NIST Addendum to SP 800-38A: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Three Variants of Ciphertext Stealing for CBC ModeFootnote 8:\n\nCBC-CS1\n\nCBC-CS2\n\nCBC-CS3\n\nNote several important requirements from SP800-38AFootnote 7:\n\nthe CBC and CFB modes require unpredictable Initialization Vectors (IVs)\n\nfor OFB mode, the IV must be a nonce that is unique to each execution of the encryption operation. It does not need to be unpredictable\n\nthe CTR mode requires a unique counter block for each block of plaintext ever encrypted under a given key, across all messages\n\nFor protecting data on storage devices, we recommend XTS-AES mode as specified in NIST SP 800-38E: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The XTS-AES Mode for Confidentiality on Storage DevicesFootnote 9.\n\n3.2 Protecting the confidentiality and authenticity of information\n\nWe recommend the following modes of operation for protecting the confidentiality and authenticity of UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECTED A, and PROTECTED B information:\n\nCounter with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CCM) as specified in NIST SP 800–38C: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: The CCM Mode for Authentication and ConfidentialityFootnote 10\n\nGalois/Counter Mode (GCM) as specified in NIST SP 800-38D: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter ModeFootnote 11\n\n4 Key establishment schemes\n\nThe following section outlines the key establishment schemes that we recommend for use with cryptographic algorithms for protecting UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECTED A, and PROTECTED B information.\n\n4.1 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)\n\nWe recommend the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)-based key-transport and key-agreement schemes as specified in NIST SP 800-56B Revision 2: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization CryptographyFootnote 12 with an RSA modulus length of at least 2048 bits.\n\nThe RSA modulus length should be increased to at least 3072 bits by the end of 2030.\n\n4.2 Finite Field Cryptography Diffie-Hellman and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV)\n\nWe recommend the Finite Field Cryptography (FFC) Diffie-Hellman (DH) and FFC Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV)-based key-agreement schemes with valid domain parameters for the FB or FC FFC parameter-size sets as specified in NIST SP 800-56A Revision 3: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm CryptographyFootnote 13.

We recommend that additional entropy be periodically added to the DRBG via the reseed function.\n\nThe assessed entropy of the initial seed for a DRBG should be increased to at least 128 bits by the end of 2030.\n\n12 Commercial technologies assurance programs\n\nIn addition to using the cryptographic algorithms, parameters, and key lengths recommended in this document to ensure a suitable level of cryptographic security, we recommend the following with respect to implementation assurance programs:\n\nCryptographic algorithm implementations should be tested and validated under the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)Footnote 30.\n\nCryptographic modules should be tested and validated under the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)Footnote 31 for compliance to FIPS 140-3: Security Requirements for Cryptographic ModulesFootnote 32.\n\nInformation technology security products should be evaluated and certified to meet the Common Criteria standardFootnote 33 by a Certificate Authorizing Scheme that is a member of the international Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement.\n\nProducts containing cryptographic modules validated under the CMVP are referenced on CMVP module validation lists and are accompanied by a vendor-supplied, non-proprietary security policy document (see Selecting a CMVP Validated Product). The security policy document specifies the cryptographic security provided by a module and describes its capabilities, protection, and access controls. We recommend using the security policy document to select suitable cryptographic security products and to configure those products in FIPS Approved Mode of Operation as defined in Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-3 and the Cryptographic Module Validation ProgramFootnote 34 to ensure that only the Cyber Centre recommended algorithms are used.\n\n13 Preparing for post quantum cryptography\n\nQuantum computers threaten to break the public key cryptosystems and weaken the symmetric cryptosystems that we currently use. Although quantum technologies are not yet powerful enough to break the cryptography recommended in this publication, there is significant research in the area. In 2016, NIST initiated a process to solicit, evaluate, and standardize post quantum public-key cryptographic algorithms. In July 2022, NIST announced the initial selections for standardizationFootnote 35, and we expect to include these in an update to this document once the standards are published.\n\nNIST is expecting to finalize the first set of standards in 2024. In the meantime, we recommend the following high-level steps:\n\nEvaluate the sensitivity of your organization’s information and determine its lifespan to identify information that may be at risk (e.g., as part of on-going risk assessment processes)\n\nReview your IT lifecycle management plan and budget for potentially significant software and hardware updates\n\nEducate your workforce on the quantum threat\n\nConsider using Stateful Hash-based Signature schemes if you meet the criteria in Section 5.5.\n\nFor more detailed information on how to prepare, see Preparing your organization for the quantum threat to cryptography (ITSAP.00.017)Footnote 36.\n\nOrganizations should wait until standards for post-quantum public-key encryption and signature schemes are finalized before using any candidate algorithm to protect information or systems.\n\n14 Summary\n\nCryptography provides security mechanisms which can be used to protect the authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity of sensitive information. Several algorithms may be required to satisfy security requirements, and each algorithm should be selected and implemented to ensure these requirements are met. This publication provides guidance on the use of the Cyber Centre recommended cryptographic algorithms to protect UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECTED A, and PROTECTED B information.\n\n15 Supporting content\n\n15.1 List of abbreviations\n\nAES\n\nAdvanced Encryption Standard\n\nCAVP\n\nCryptographic Algorithm Validation Program\n\nCBC\n\nCipher Block Chaining\n\nCDH\n\nCofactor Diffie-Hellman\n\nCCM\n\nCipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code\n\nCFB\n\nCipher Feedback\n\nCMAC\n\nCipher-based Message Authentication Code\n\nCMVP\n\nCryptographic Module Validation Program\n\nCS\n\nCiphertext Stealing\n\nCSE\n\nCommunications Security Establishment\n\nCTR\n\nCounter\n\nDH\n\nDiffie-Hellman\n\nDRBG\n\nDeterministic Random Bit Generator\n\nDSA\n\nDigital Signature Algorithm\n\nECB\n\nElectronic Codebook\n\nECC\n\nElliptic Curve Cryptography\n\nECDSA\n\nElliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\n\nFFC\n\nFinite Field Cryptography\n\nFIPS\n\nFederal Information Processing Standards\n\nGC\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\nGCM\n\nGalois/Counter Mode\n\nGMAC\n\nGalois/Counter Mode Message Authentication Code\n\nHMAC\n\nKeyed-Hash Message Authentication Code\n\nIETF\n\nInternet Engineering Task Force\n\nIKE\n\nInternet Key Exchange\n\nIT\n\nInformation Technology\n\nITS\n\nInformation Technology Security\n\nITSG\n\nInformation Technology Security Guidance\n\nITSP\n\nInformation Technology Security Guidance for Practitioners\n\nKDF\n\nKey Derivation Function\n\nKW\n\nKey Wrap\n\nKWP\n\nKey Wrap with Padding\n\nMAC\n\nMessage Authentication Code\n\nMQV\n\nMenezes-Qu-Vanstone\n\nNIST\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\n\nOFB\n\nOutput Feedback\n\nPRF\n\nPseudorandom Function\n\nRFC\n\nRequest for Comments\n\nRSA\n\nRivest Shamir Adleman\n\nSHA\n\nSecure Hash Algorithm\n\nSP\n\nSpecial Publication\n\nSRTP\n\nSecure Real-time Transport Protocol\n\nSSH\n\nSecure Shell\n\nTBS\n\nTreasury Board of Canada Secretariat\n\nTDEA\n\nTriple Data Encryption Algorithm\n\nTKW\n\nTriple Data Encryption Algorithm Key Wrap\n\nTLS\n\nTransport Layer Security\n\nTPM\n\nTrusted Platform Module\n\nTRA\n\nThreat and Risk Assessment\n\nXOF\n\neXtendable Output Function\n\n15.2 Glossary\n\nAuthentication\n\nA measure designed to provide protection against fraudulent transmissions or imitations by establishing the validity of a transmission, message, or originator.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nThe state of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe state of being accessible and usable in a timely and reliable manner.\n\nClassified Information\n\nInformation related to the national interest that may qualify for an exception or exclusion under the Access to Information Act or Privacy Act and the compromise of which could reasonably be expected to cause injury to the national interest.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThe state of being disclosed only to authorized principals.\n\nCryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)\n\nA program that is used to validate the functional correctness of the cryptographic algorithms implemented in the cryptographic module.\n\nCryptographic Module\n\nThe set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that implements cryptographic security functions (including cryptographic algorithms and key generation) and is contained within the cryptographic boundary.\n\nCryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)\n\nA joint NIST and Cyber Centre program that is used to validate cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-3 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, and other NIST cryptographic standards and recommendations.
