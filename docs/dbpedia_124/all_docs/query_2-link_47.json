        "text": "Computing is part of everything we do. Computing drives innovation in engineering, business, entertainment, education, and the sciences—and it provides solutions to complex, challenging problems of all kinds.\n\nComputer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and their expert programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.\n\nHow is Computer Science Different from IT?\n\nComputer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational principles that are the basis of all software.\n\nInformation technology (IT) focuses on the development, implementation, support, and management of computers and information systems. IT involves working both with hardware (CPUs, RAM, hard disks) and software (operating systems, web browsers, mobile applications). IT professionals make sure that computers, networks, and systems work well for all users.\n\nWhat Careers does Computer Science Offer?\n\nComputing jobs are among the highest paid today, and computer science professionals report high job satisfaction. Most computer scientists hold at least a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field.\n\nPrincipal areas of study and careers within computer science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human-computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics, and theory of computing.\n\nSome common job titles for computer scientists include:\n\nComputer Programmer\n\nInformation Technology Specialist\n\nData Scientist\n\nWeb Optimization Specialist\n\nDatabase Administrator\n\nSystems Analyst\n\nWeb Developer\n\nQuality Assurance Engineer\n\nBusiness Intelligence Analyst\n\nSystems Engineer\n\nProduct Manager\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nHardware Engineer\n\nFront-End Developer\n\nBack-End Developer\n\nFull-Stack Developer\n\nMobile Developer\n\nNetwork Administrator\n\nChief Information Officer\n\nSecurity Analyst\n\nVideo Game Developer\n\nHealth Information Technician\n\nHow Much do Computer Science Professionals Make?\n\nThe mean entry-level salary for computer programmers is $64,048 (Payscale), accordion to payscale.com. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a mean annual wage for computer programmers of $107,750 (BLS) while the highest 10 percent earn $167,230 (BLS).\n\nSalaries for Careers with a Computer Science Degree Career Mean Entry-Level Salary (Payscale) Mean Annual Wage (BLS) Top 10 Percent (BLS) Computer Hardware Engineer $76,707 $147,770 $212,770 Computer and Information Systems Manager $65,570 $180,720 $239,200 Computer Programmer $64,048 $107,750 $167,230 Computer Science Teacher, Postsecondary $106,380 $175,150 Computer Systems Analyst $60,865 $110,800 $165,700 Database Administrator $60,788 $104,810 $157,710 Database Architect $85,612 $137,030 $195,000 Data Scientist $86,906 $119,040 $184,090 Information Security Analyst $63,458 $124,740 $182,370 Network and Computer Systems Administrator $56,451 $100,580 $148,710 Software Developer $68,041 $138,110 $208,620 Web Developer $52,224 $95,570 $157,280 Web and Digital Interface Designer $57,344 $108,820 $176,490\n\nSee additional computing salary information.\n\nWhat Skills do Computer Scientists Need?\n\nLearning how to program and code is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. And because computers solve problems to serve and enrich people, there is a significant human component to computer science. Due to the range and complexity of the projects they take on, computer scientists depend on both technical knowledge and essential skills like communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Other useful skills include:\n\nAnalytical and logical thinking\n\nTechnical and mathematical skills\n\nAttention to detail\n\nProject management\n\nTechnical writing\n\nResearch\n\nArt and design\n\nNot all computer science professionals will need every skill listed—because of the broad nature of the field, they have the opportunity to focus on the skills pertinent to their unique interests and chosen focus area (which may change over time).\n\nThe Future of Computer Science\n\nWhat does the future of computer science look like? There's no end in sight! Computing has permeated our lives and its influence just keeps growing—from the apps on our phones to any device with a computer processor, computing is here to stay.\n\nFuture opportunities in computing are without boundaries. Across virtually every industry, computer science professionals are engaged in programming, systems analysis, database administration, network architecture, software development, research, and more.\n\nComputing at Michigan Tech\n\nMichigan Tech's College of Computing is the first college in Michigan fully dedicated to computing, and one of only a few nationwide. Michigan Tech computer science students gain a depth of knowledge and experience through a wide range of classroom and hands-on learning opportunities.\n\nFrom industry-standard learning labs to internships, co-ops, and our Enterprise program, you'll get lots of hands-on experience at Michigan Tech. In the Enterprise program, you'll work with a team of students (from any major) on real projects for real clients in an environment that's more like a business than a classroom. With coaching from faculty mentors, our Enterprise teams invent products, provide services, and pioneer solutions. You'll gain rich experiences in engineering design, team building, project management, and end-to-end original product development.\n\nStudying computer science at Michigan Tech is a secure choice for your future. With a degree in computer science from Michigan Tech, you won't be tied to a specific technology or industry for your entire career. It's a fundamentals degree that will serve you throughout your life, no matter how your interests change over time. Plus, with the unique experiences you'll gain during your time here, you'll be prepared for whatever tomorrow needs.\n\nGeneral Computing Program\n\nIf you're still deciding which computer science focus you want to pursue, the first-year undergraduate General Computing program gives you one or two semesters to explore the discipline and decide which degree program sparks your curiosity the most. It's a starting point to give you some space to choose the computing field that fits you the best.\n\nUndergraduate Degree Programs\n\nComputer Science (BS)—choose a concentration in Computer Science, Applications, Computer Systems, or Game Development\n\nCybersecurity (BS)—choose a concentration in Software Security or System and Network Security\n\nMath + Computer Science (BS)\n\nSoftware Engineering (BS)\n\nGraduate Degree Programs\n\nComputer Science (MS, PhD)\n\nCybersecurity (MS)\n\nData Science (MS)\n\nComputational Science and Engineering (PhD)\n\nAccelerated Master's Program\n\nOur accelerated master's program allows you to count up to 6 senior-level credits toward both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, and many more majors.\n\nComputer Science Research"
