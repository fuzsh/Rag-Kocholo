It uses a fixed key which consist of the 26 letters of a “shuffled alphabet”.\n\nWith the above key, all “A” letters in the plain text will be encoded to an “M”.\n\nThis type of cipher is a form of symmetric encryption as the same key can be used to both encrypt and decrypt a message.\n\nYou can generate your own encryption keys and encrypt your own messages using our online mono-alphabetic substitution engine:\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\nOne approach used to help decrypt a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher is to use a frequency analysis based on counting the number of occurrence of each letter to help identify the most recurrent letters. (e.g. In the English language, letters E, T and A).\n\nYour Task:\n\nComplete a frequency analysis to decrypt the following ciphers."
