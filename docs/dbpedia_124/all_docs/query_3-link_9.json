        "text": "A symmetric encryption is any technique where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest symmetric encryption techniques, and of course, one of the easiest to crack.\n\nSince then, cryptologists have invented many more symmetric encryption techniques, including the ones used today to encrypt data like passwords.\n\nFrench cryptologists invented the Vigenère Cipher in the mid 1500s. The cipher was considered especially strong, and author Lewis Caroll even called it “unbreakable” in 1868. It was indeed much stronger than the Caesar Cipher, but as we’ll see, it can definitely be cracked.\n\nThe Vigenère cipher uses an entire word as the shift key, as opposed to the Caesar Cipher’s single shift amount.\n\nImagine that we want to encrypt the phrase VERSAILLES and use a shift key of CHEESE.\n\nFirst, we need to repeat the shift key to line up with each of the letters in the phrase:\n\nNow we replace each letter of the original text according to the Vigenère table:\n\nFor the first letter \"V\", we select the row that starts with \"V\". Then since the corresponding shift key letter is \"C\", we move to the column that has a header of \"C\". The letter at the intersection of the \"V\" row and \"C\" column is \"X\". Thus, we encrypt \"V\" as \"X\".\n\nThe letter at the intersection of the \"E\" row and \"H\" column is \"L\", so we encrypt \"E\" as \"L\".\n\nIf we keep going, we'll end up with the encrypted text \"XLVWSMNSIW\".\n\nImagine that we receive the encrypted message \"NVYZJI\" from our ally, and we know they've used a Vigenère cipher with a shift key of \"CHEESE\".\n\nOnce again, we line the encrypted message up with the shift key:\n\nNow we can do a reverse substitution according to the table:\n\nWe start by selecting the row for the first letter in the shift key \"C\". Then we scan down that row until we find the first encrypted letter \"N\". Once we find the \"N\", we look up to see the header for that column, \"L\". Thus, the decryption of \"N\" is \"L\".\n\nFor the next letter, we select the \"H\" row, find the \"V\" in the row, and look up to see we're in column \"O\".\n\nIf we do that for each shift key and encrypted letter, we decrypt the entire phrase as \"LOUVRE\".\n\nThe Vigenère Cipher is a type of polyalphabetic cipher, and it's a harder code to crack than the Caesar Cipher due to the use of an entire shift word.\n\nIf an intercepter had no idea what the shift key was and wanted to brute force their way to a decryption, they would need to try out all the possible shift words in the world, and perhaps even made-up words! For a mere mortal, that could take a lifetime. That's much more work than brute forcing the Caesar Cipher, where we just had to check 26 different shift amounts.\n\nWhat about frequency analysis? Do messages encrypted with the Vigenere cipher have a special pattern in their distribution of letters?\n\nTry it out for yourself! Encrypt the message below, and you'll see a frequency analysis of the original message and the encrypted message.\n\nNotice that the frequency analysis of the original message is exactly what we'd expect for an English-language message: \"E\" is the most popular letter, and there is huge variance in the frequency of the letters.\n\nThe frequencies of the encrypted message are more similar to each other. We can't identify an obvious \"E\", since the letter \"E\" gets encrypted into different letters at different points in the message.\n\nIn the 1800s, people finally figured out different ways to use frequency analysis to crack the cipher. For example, in a long message, a short word like \"THE\" may get translated to the same three encrypted letters multiple times (just not every time), and that reveals possible lengths for the shift key.\n\nNow that we have the use of powerful computers, the Vigenère Cipher is relatively easy to decipher, because a computer can quickly test out millions of words, and it can easily find the leaked information in the frequency analysis.\n\nIn the age of computers, ciphers can't just be hard to crack by an enterprising human; they have to be hard to crack by a computer that can do trillions of calculations per second.\n\nFortunately, cryptologists have invented encryption techniques that are secure in the digital world, and are continuing to improve them every year.\n\nOne of the most common encryption standards is AES-128, a block cipher approved by the federal government and used often for secure file transfer.\n\nWhat makes it so secure?\n\nOne reason is that each key is always 128 bits long. That means there are 2128‍ possible keys. That's this many:\n\nWow! But wait, there's more: the AES cipher requires applying a sequence of 10 mathematical operations for each bit of the key. Multiply that number above by 10, and that's the number of calculations a computer would need to do.\n\nThe fastest computer can calculate around 145×1015‍ operations per second. That's this many:\n\nThe fastest computer would still take 500 trillion years to try every possible 128-bit key!\n\nWhat about frequency analysis? It won't work. The AES cipher does not reveal any information about the original text, thanks to the multi-step sequence of operations on blocks of bits.\n\nThe AES ciphers, and other modern ciphers, may not be secure forever. Security researchers spend their time trying to find clever ways to break the cipher, and present findings in blogs and conference talks.\n\nCryptography research is done in the open, with the hope that the public finds out about a security breach before a malicious cybercriminal discovers one."
