        "text": "In the last chapter, we have dealt with reverse cipher. This chapter talks about Caesar cipher in detail.\n\nAlgorithm of Caesar Cipher\n\nThe algorithm of Caesar cipher holds the following features −\n\nCaesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.\n\nIt is simple type of substitution cipher.\n\nEach letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.\n\nThe following diagram depicts the working of Caesar cipher algorithm implementation −\n\nThe program implementation of Caesar cipher algorithm is as follows −\n\ndef encrypt(text,s): result = \"\" # transverse the plain text for i in range(len(text)): char = text[i] # Encrypt uppercase characters in plain text if (char.isupper()): result += chr((ord(char) + s-65) % 26 + 65) # Encrypt lowercase characters in plain text else: result += chr((ord(char) + s - 97) % 26 + 97) return result #check the above function text = \"CEASER CIPHER DEMO\" s = 4 print \"Plain Text : \" + text print \"Shift pattern : \" + str(s) print \"Cipher: \" + encrypt(text,s)\n\nOutput\n\nYou can see the Caesar cipher, that is the output as shown in the following image −\n\nExplanation\n\nThe plain text character is traversed one at a time.\n\nFor each character in the given plain text, transform the given character as per the rule depending on the procedure of encryption and decryption of text.\n\nAfter the steps is followed, a new string is generated which is referred as cipher text.\n\nHacking of Caesar Cipher Algorithm\n\nThe cipher text can be hacked with various possibilities. One of such possibility is Brute Force Technique, which involves trying every possible decryption key. This technique does not demand much effort and is relatively simple for a hacker.\n\nThe program implementation for hacking Caesar cipher algorithm is as follows −\n\nmessage = 'GIEWIVrGMTLIVrHIQS' #encrypted message LETTERS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' for key in range(len(LETTERS)): translated = '' for symbol in message: if symbol in LETTERS: num = LETTERS.find(symbol) num = num - key if num < 0: num = num + len(LETTERS) translated = translated + LETTERS[num] else: translated = translated + symbol print('Hacking key #%s: %s' % (key, translated))\n\nConsider the cipher text encrypted in the previous example. Then, the output with possible hacking methods with the key and using brute force attack technique is as follows −"
