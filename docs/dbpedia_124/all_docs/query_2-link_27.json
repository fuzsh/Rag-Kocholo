        "text": "The purpose of this document is to give a statistical evaluation of the NESSIE submission Anubis. For this evaluation, we follow the recommendations of the NESSIE statistical evaluation process for blockcipher submissions as described in [Sch01a]. 1 Overview The NESSIE submission Anubis is a 128-bit blockcipher with key length between 128 and 320 bits, developed by Paulo Barreto and Vincent Rijmen. For a 32N-bit key, 4 N 10, the cipher has N + 8 rounds. In this document only the cipher version with 128 bit key size will be evaluated. The results for other key sizes should be similar. This document is organized as follows: The next two sections present the statistical evaluation of the full round version of Anubis as well as some statistical evaluation of reduced round versions of the cipher. In the two remaining sections we give the results of the NESSIE streamcipher tests applied to Anubis in OFB mode and in counter mode [Sch01b], respectively.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give a statistical evaluation of the NESSIE submission Noekeon. For this evaluation, we follow the recommendations of the NESSIE statistical evaluation process for blockcipher submissions as described in [Sch01a]. 1 Overview The NESSIE submission Noekeon is a 128-bit blockcipher with key length of 128 bits, developed Joan Daemen, Michael Peeters, Gilles Van Assche and Vincent Rijmen. The cipher has sixteen rounds. This document is organized as follows: The next two sections present the statistical evaluation of the full round version of Noekeon as well as the statistical evaluation of reduced round versions of the cipher. In the two remaining sections we give the results of the NESSIE streamcipher tests applied to Noekeon in OFB mode and in counter mode [Sch01b], respectively.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give a statistical evaluation of the NESSIE submission Khazad. For this evaluation, we follow the recommendations of the NESSIE statistical evaluation process for blockcipher submissions as described in [Sch01a]. 1 Overview The NESSIE submission Khazad is a 64-bit blockcipher with key length of 128 bits, developed by Paulo Barreto and Vincent Rijmen. A cipher round has three components, an S-box layer, multiplication with a matrix, and key addition. The cipher has eight rounds. This document is organized as follows: The next two sections present the statistical evaluation of the full round version of Khazad as well as the statistical evaluation of reduced round versions of the cipher. In the two remaining sections we give the results of the NESSIE streamcipher tests applied to Khazad in OFB mode and in counter mode [Sch01b], respectively.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give a statistical evaluation of the NESSIE submission Idea. For this evaluation, we follow the recommendations of the NESSIE statistical evaluation process for blockcipher submissions as described in [Sch01a]. 1 Overview The NESSIE submission Idea is a 64-bit blockcipher with key length of 128 bits, submitted by MediaCrypt AG. A cipher round uses three operations, XOR, addition modulo 2 and multiplication modulo 2 + 1. The cipher has eight rounds. This document is organized as follows: The next two sections present the statistical evaluation of the full round version of Idea as well as some statistical evaluation of reduced round versions of the cipher. In the two remaining sections we give the results of the NESSIE streamcipher tests applied to Idea in OFB mode and in counter mode [Sch01b], respectively. 2 Statistical evaluation of the NESSIE blockcipher Idea with full rounds The NESSIE evaluation tools for blockciphers consist of the dependence test and the linear factors test. For a detailed introduction to the dependence test and linear factors test, please refer to the documents [Bol90, Dic91]. 2.1 The Dependence Test The dependence test evaluates the dependence matrix and the distance matrix of the cipher. Furthermore, the degree of completeness, the degree of avalanche e#ect and the degree of strict avalanche criterion of the cipher are computed. A cryptographic function is complete if each output bit depends on each input bit. For a function to exhibit the avalanche e#ect, an average of one half of the output bits should change whenever a single input bit is complemented. A function satisfies the strict avalanche criterion if each output bit changes with a probability of one half whenever a single input bit is compleme..."
