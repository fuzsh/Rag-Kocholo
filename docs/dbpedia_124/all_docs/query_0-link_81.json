        "text": "HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. When making a connection using HTTPS, either SSL or TLS will be used to encrypt the information being sent to and from the server. This encryption makes it very difficult for a third party to read the data packets. The information is encrypted using a Cipher or encryption key, the type of Cipher used depends on the Cipher Suite installed and the preferences of the server.\n\nThis article describes how to find the Cipher used by an HTTPS connection, by using Internet Explorer, Chrome or FireFox, to read the certificate information.\n\nHTTPS | TLS | SSL\n\nInstructions\n\nUsing a browser to open an HTTPS page and check the certificate properties to find the type of Cipher used to encrypt the connection.\n\nHow to find the Cipher in Internet Explorer\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer.\n\nEnter the URL you wish to check in the browser.\n\nRight-click the page or select the Page drop-down menu, and select Properties.\n\nIn the new window, look for the Connection section. This will describe the version of TLS or SSL used.\n\nHow to find the Cipher in Chrome\n\nLaunch Chrome.\n\nEnter the URL you wish to check in the browser.\n\nClick on the ellipsis located on the top-right in the browser.\n\nSelect More tools > Developer tools > Security\n\nLook for the line \"Connection...\". This will describe the version of TLS or SSL used.\n\nHow to find the Cipher in FireFox\n\nLaunch FireFox.\n\nEnter the URL you wish to check in the browser.\n\nIn the address bar, click the icon to the left of the URL.\n\nNow click on More Information.\n\nSelect the Security tab.\n\nLook for the Technical details section. This will describe the version of TLS or SSL used.\n\nIf you are interested in HTTPS ciphers, you should be monitoring your web server. GSX Monitor will carefully observe the processes and services of your IIS and Windows servers to prevent potential issues from arising.\n\nWhy not sign up for a free trial?\n\nMicrosoft Related articles\n\nClient test for change of negotiable ciphers on App Services effective March 2017\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n131 out of 292 found this helpful\n\nNot finding what you are looking for?\n\nHave more questions?
