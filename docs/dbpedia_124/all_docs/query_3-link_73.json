        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nWhat Is Data Encryption?\n\nSecure data transfer is a paramount activity for PC users and business owners.\n\nIts significance can be felt when security breaches cost businesses millions of dollars when secure data transfer is overlooked.\n\nAlbeit you do not possess a lot in your personal or business account, securing the little you have is noteworthy.\n\nTechnology experts have unveiled numerous forms of securing data transfer, but data encryption is the commonest and easiest method that every PC user should be aware of and able to use.\n\nBy encryption, the data is “scrambled” such that an unintended person cannot read it.\n\nData encryption involves the translation of data into a format such that only the intend persons who have a decryption key, also referred to as a secret key will be able to read it.\n\nBefore encryption, the data is referred to as plaintext while after encryption the data is termed as ciphertext.\n\nData encryption is purposely executed to secure confidential information during storage or when being transferred from one computer system to another.\n\nToday, new encryption algorithms have been developed to replace the out-of-date DES – data encryption standard – where the former plays a very significant role in securing information and computing systems.\n\nThe modern encryption tools come with confidentiality properties such as data integrity, data authentication as well as non-cancellation features.\n\nBy authentication, the sender of the data is identified and verified; the integrity feature proves that the content of the information is not distorted while the non-cancellation property ensures that the person who sends the information cannot repudiate transferring it.\n\nThe earliest forms of data encryption were primitive; some involved changing letters in the sentence. This rendered the whole sentence absolutely unreadable and required a lot of time to figure out what the spewed characters meant.\n\nWith time, people discovered how to crack codes, and the encryption technique required more sophistication to ensure that the message was kept private.\n\nToday, data encryption algorithms find extensive application in File Transfer Protocol (FTP) transfers and computer systems to offer protected transfers.\n\nWhen the algorithms are used for transfers, the information is initially transformed into an unreadable ciphertext and sent in this format, upon which the receiver uses a secret key or a password to decode the ciphertext into its initial format.\n\nIn case an intruder accesses the file before reaching the final computer, they cannot read it as it is encrypted.\n\nWhy Is Data Encryption Important For Business?\n\nWhen it comes to technology-based business, data encryption is mainly used for internet networks, internet communication, backup, and archiving. Data encryption is highly important for businesses for various reasons such as:\n\nConfidentiality:\n\nData encryption helps in preventing unauthorized access to information that is sensitive. It ensures that only authorized users will be able to view and access it.\n\nSecurity:\n\nData encryption helps the business in protecting data from theft or hacking. It makes it more difficult for hackers or attackers to steal the data or information thereby ensuring data security.\n\nTrust:\n\nData encryption demonstrates the commitment in order to protect sensitive information- this helps in building trust between organizations, partners, or even customers.\n\nPrivacy:\n\nData encryption ensures privacy by protecting personal information such as health records, financial statements, etc. It helps the business by restricting access to information without permission.\n\nCompliance:\n\nData encryption became a necessity for regulations such as HIPAA for health care or PCI DSS for card payment data in many businesses and industries.\n\nHow Does Data Encryption Work?\n\nData encryption works by transforming plaintext into code that is unreadable by using encryption algorithms as well as keys.\n\nThe data which are encrypted are called cyphertext and this can only be decrypted and read by someone who possesses the correct decryption key. The following is the process of data encryption:\n\nThe initial step is to generate the unique key which will be used to encrypt as well as decrypt the data\n\nThe next step is to process the encryption data and encryption key by plain text data thus creating cyphertext\n\nAfter creating the cyphertext, it should be stored or transmitted to any devices\n\nThe created cyphertext can be decrypted using an encryption algorithm and decryption key to convert it back to plain data.\n\nTypes of Data Encryption\n\nThere are mainly two types of data encryption which are:\n\nSymmetric Encryption\n\nAsymmetric Encryption\n\nSymmetric Encryption:\n\nSymmetric encryption is also called shared-key encryption since it uses the same key for encryption and decryption. The key must be well protected and kept secret and should be shared by only the recipient and the sender.\n\nAsymmetric Encryption:\n\nAsymmetric Encryption is also called public-key encryption since it has two keys one for encryption of the data ( can be in public) and one for decryption of the data( must be kept private). This is mainly used for securing communication and for digital signatures.\n\nStrongest Data Encryption Algorithms\n\nThere are several data encryption algorithms available:\n\nTriple Data Encryption Standard (TripleDES)\n\nThis form of data encryption algorithm applies block cipher algorithms thrice to all the data blocks individually.\n\nThe magnitude of the key is enlarged to provide extra protection by increasing the encryption ability.\n\nEvery individual block constitutes of 64-bit data. In this encryption algorithm, three keys are used where each key constitutes of 56 bits.\n\nA total of three key permutations are provided under this standard:\n\nMost importantly, we call #3 triple DES whose key length consists of (3*56 bits = 168 bits) whereas key security consists of (2*56 bits = 112 bits).\n\nThe substantially longer key length of this type of encryption algorithms overpowers other encryption techniques.\n\nNevertheless, after the development of the advanced encryption standard (AES), TripleDES has been rendered old-fashioned.\n\nBlowfish Encryption Algorithm\n\nDeveloped in 1993, the Blowfish encryption algorithm is an alternative for Data Encryption Standard (DES).\n\nBefore its creation, encryptions were performed by patents and intellectual properties of firms.\n\nThe developer placed the protocol to the public to make it readily available for any interested user.\n\nCompared to DES, it is substantially faster and offers better encryption security.\n\nIt is an asymmetric type of encryption protocol: uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.\n\nLike Twofish, it is a block cipher and its block size is 64-bit and the key size lies anywhere between 32 – 448 bits.\n\nIt features 18 subkeys, sixteen rounds and has four S-boxes.\n\nIts protection capability has been examined and proved.\n\nConsidering blowfish standard is regarded as a Feistel cipher, a single structure is used to encrypt and decrypt data provided that the reverse direction of the round keys is considered.\n\nIt is a significantly fast operation because it involves a relatively small number of rounds as well as its clarity of functionality.\n\nNevertheless, its key-scheduling consumes a lot of time, although it has an upper hand when it comes to protecting brute-force threats.\n\nAlso, its 64-bit block length (size) is rather small making it endangered by birthday attacks compared to AES whose block size is 128 bits and above.\n\nTwofish Encryption Algorithm\n\nThis form of the encryption algorithm is a symmetric key block cipher which is characterized by 128-bit block size and whose keys’ size can run up to 256 bits.\n\nThis protocol uses one key for encryption and decryption.\n\nIt is a fast and flexible standard for eight-bit and thirty two-bit CPUs, and small smart cards.\n\nThe protocol works exemplarily in hardware and has numerous functionality commutations between the speed of encryption and the setup time making it distinctive amongst other protocols.\n\nThe standard shares some features with its predecessor, blowfish Encryption Algorithm and AES.\n\nAt one time, this encryption algorithm was a real contestant for the best encryption standard, but the present AES beat it out.\n\nThis algorithm bears several peculiar characteristics that distinguish it from other standards.\n\nFirst, this cryptographic protocol applies substitution-boxes, S-boxes that are pre-computed and key-reliant.\n\nThis implies that despite the provision of the S-box, it relies on the cipher key for the decryption of the encrypted data.\n\nThe significance of the S-box is to conceal the key connection with the ciphertext.\n\nSecondly, the Twofish encryption standard is accepted as a substantially secure alternative.\n\nEncryption protocols whose keys have 128 bits and above are regarded as safe from attacks: Twofish has a block size of 128 bits.\n\nTwofish protocol comes with several options.\n\nTo execute fast encryption, the key setup time can be made longer; this is done when the amount of data (plaintext) to be encrypted is relatively large.\n\nThe encryption can be made slower by setting a shorter key setup time when short blocks with constantly alternating keys are to be encrypted.\n\nFor some PC users, Twofish is regarded as the best AES protocol due to its peculiar amalgamation of design, resilience, and speed.\n\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n\nAES is the most popular and broadly used symmetric encryption standard today.\n\nDue to the DES’s small key size and low computing capability, a replacement was required which led to the development of AES.\n\nCompared with TripleDES, it has been proved to be more than six times faster.\n\nConcerning cybersecurity, the AES acronym, in particular, keeps popping up on all computer screens as it is the world’s most accepted encryption standard.\n\nIt is seen while using messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp, computer platforms such as VeraCrypt and other technologies commonly used.\n\nThe AES standard constitutes 3 block ciphers where each block cipher uses cryptographic keys to perform data encryption and decryption in a 128-bit block.\n\nA single key is used for encryption and decryption thus both the sender and receiver have the same key.\n\nThe sizes of the keys are considered adequate to secure the classified data to a satisfactory secret level.\n\nIDEA Encryption Algorithm\n\nThe international data encryption algorithm abbreviated as IDEA is a symmetric block cipher data encryption protocol.\n\nThe key size of the block cipher is 128 bits and is regarded as a substantially secure and one of the best public standards.\n\nOf the numerous years, this protocol has been in the market, there is no single attack that has been published in spite of the numerous trials to identify them.\n\nThe standard was patent in the US and Europe. It is used for non-commercial purposes while commercial authentication can be accessed from Ascom-Tech.\n\nTypically, the block cipher runs in round blocks. It applies fifty-two subkeys where each has a 16-bit length.\n\nTwo subkeys are applied for a single round, four subkeys are applied prior to and after every round.\n\nTypically, both the plain text and the ciphertext have equal sizes of 16 bytes.\n\nMD5 Encryption Algorithm\n\nThis protocol was purposely developed to offer data security as it can take inputs of arbitrary size to generate a 128-bit hash value output.\n\nUnder this protocol, the encryption technique follows 5 phases where every phase features a predefined task.\n\nThe five steps include:\n\nOne notable advantage of MD5 is that the protocol allows the generation of a message digest using the initial message.\n\nNevertheless, the protocol is relatively slow.\n\nHMAC Encryption Algorithm\n\nHMAC stands for hash message authentication code and it is applied to ascertain the message integrity and authenticity.\n\nThe protocol applies 2 hash computation passes and a cryptographic key.\n\nThis standard resembles most digital signatures only that symmetric keys are used in HMAC whereas asymmetric types of keys are used in digital signatures.\n\nRSA Security\n\nThis standard offers protection against cyber-attacks by detecting and responding to threats, preventing online fraud, management identification, et al.\n\nIts data encryption is founded on the application of both a public key as well as a private key.\n\nRSA algorithm generates the two keys simultaneously.\n\nWhen the computer is running on a secure website, the protocol generates a public key that is available publicly for data encryption.\n\nOn the other hand, the encrypted text is decrypted using the private key. Sender identification is done with the aid of the public key.\n\nIn conclusion, whether securing your communication information or CVs on your PC, you should use some form of encryption as a protection tool. This way, your data is protected and you will have the convenience when you need to access it."
