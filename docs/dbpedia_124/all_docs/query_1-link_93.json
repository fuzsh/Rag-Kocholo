        "text": "Encryption has evolved significantly over time. Early instances of cryptography and techniques resembling encryption date back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians. Encryption was later popularized in wartime and espionage efforts and famously associated with the Enigma Machine, a World War II encryption device that was used by the Germans to encode secret messages.\n\nToday, encryption is critical in safeguarding sensitive data, especially as organizations transition to the cloud or employ hybrid cloud environments. This shift often leads to data complexity, including data sprawl and expanding attack surfaces.\n\nAs a result of this data complexity, data breaches can become more costly and more frequent. According to the Cost of a Data Breach report, the global average cost to remediate a data breach in 2023 was USD 4.45 million, a 15 percent increase over three years.\n\nWith encryption, organizations can deter or mitigate the severity of data breaches. This is achieved by ensuring that hackers canâ€™t access their most sensitive data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nOrganizations, particularly those in healthcare and financial services, also use encryption to meet compliance standards.\n\nFor example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that merchants encrypt the customer payment card data they handle. Similarly, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) highlights encryption as a critical measure for safeguarding personal data against unauthorized access or disclosure.\n\nStill, it's not just organizations demanding encryption. Users increasingly seek the peace of mind encryption brings. Signal, a messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption, reported a jump from 12 million to 40 million users in 2022 (link resides outside ibm.com) amid concerns over WhatsApp's privacy policies and data-sharing practices.\n\nIn recent years, modern encryption algorithms have largely replaced outdated standards like the Data Encryption Standard (DES).\n\nNew algorithms not only mask data but also support key information security principles such as integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation. Integrity ensures that unauthorized parties do not tamper with data, authentication verifies data origins, and nonrepudiation prevents users from denying legitimate activity.\n\nCurrent trends in encryption focus on enhancing encryption algorithms and protocols to keep pace with evolving cyberthreats and technologies.\n\nQuantum encryption uses principles of quantum mechanics to create cryptographic keys that are theoretically immune to brute-force attacks.\n\nHomomorphic encryption allows organizations to perform computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption. This approach means that organizations can use sensitive data for things like AI model training and analysis without compromising confidentiality or individual privacy.\n\nKey management is critical for effective data encryption. To understand why, consider the example of a safe. If an individual forgets their code to a safe or it ends up in the wrong hands, they risk losing access to their most valuable possessions or having them stolen.\n\nThe same logic applies to cryptographic keys. If organizations don't properly manage their keys, they can lose the ability to decrypt and access data or expose themselves to data breaches.\n\nFor this reason, organizations often prioritize investing in key management systems. These services are critical given that organizations frequently manage a complex network of cryptographic keys, and many threat actors know where to look for them.\n\nEncryption key management solutions often include features like:\n\nA centralized management console for encryption and encryption key policies and configurations\n\nEncryption at the file, database, and application levels for on-premises and cloud data\n\nRole- and group-based access controls and audit logging to help address compliance\n\nAutomated key lifecycle processes\n\nIntegration with the latest technologies, such as AI, to improve key management by using analytics and automation\n\nEncryption can provide various data protection benefits both on premises and in the cloud. Some of the most significant benefits include:\n\nData security\n\nEncryption is among the most critical and widespread data security tools. By encoding plain text as ciphertext, encryption helps organizations protect data against a range of cyberattacks, including ransomware and other malware.\n\nNotably, the use of info stealer malware that exfiltrates sensitive data is up 266 percent from 2022, according to the 2024 IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index. Encryption helps combat this threat by making data unusable to hackers, defeating the purpose of stealing it.\n\nRecent advances in AI-powered encryption systems have also revolutionized data security practices. These solutions use AI to dynamically adjust encryption parameters based on contextual factors such as network traffic, device type, and user behavior. This adaptive approach allows organizations to optimize encryption algorithms in real-time and tailor their data protection strategies to evolving security threats.\n\nCloud security\n\nWhile cloud service providers (CSPs) are responsible for the security of the cloud, customers are responsible for security in the cloud, including the security of any data. Enterprise-wide data encryption can help organizations protect their sensitive data on-premises and in the cloud.\n\nCompliance management\n\nMany industries and jurisdictions have regulatory requirements and security measures mandating that organizations use encryption to protect sensitive data. Compliance with these regulations helps organizations avoid legal penalties and maintain customer trust.\n\nData integrity\n\nCryptographic tools like hash functions can help detect unauthorized modifications or tampering attempts, which can help ensure the accuracy and integrity of stored and transmitted data.\n\nSecure communications\n\nEncryption keeps communication channels secure, allowing individuals and organizations to exchange sensitive information, conduct transactions and collaborate with a reduced risk of interception.\n\nProtection against insider threats\n\nEncryption restricts access to sensitive data to only the users that have the appropriate decryption keys. This measure helps prevent employees from intentionally or unintentionally accessing, misusing, or misplacing sensitive information. For example, even if an employee's company-issued laptop is lost, properly encrypted data on the hard disk remains inaccessible.\n\nDespite its many benefits, encryption is vulnerable to some attacks and misuse. Some common weaknesses of current encryption technologies include:\n\nQuantum computing\n\nThe rise of quantum computing threatens traditional encryption methods. Quantum computers could break some encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, by running powerful quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm. Shor's algorithm can efficiently factor large numbers and solve the discrete logarithm problem, a difficult math problem that many encryption schemes rely on.\n\nHowever, organizations are also using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop quantum-resistant encryption methods. These encryption solutions use AI to anticipate and adapt to potential quantum computing threats before they can break traditional encryption algorithms.\n\nBrute-force attacks\n\nBrute-force attacks involve hackers systematically trying all possible encryption keys until they discover the correct one. Strong encryption algorithms historically take far too long to break when using brute-force methods. However, advances in computing power risk rendering some encryption methods vulnerable to brute-force attacks.\n\nAlgorithm vulnerabilities\n\nAttackers can exploit vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms to decrypt encrypted data. One significant vulnerability is the \"Padding Oracle Attack,\" which involves hackers manipulating padding (extra bits added to plaintext) to reveal plain text data.\n\nSide-channel attacks\n\nSide channels are unintended pathways for information leakage, such as timing discrepancies and variations in power consumption and electromagnetic emissions. Hackers can use these side channels to gain information about the encryption process and recover encryption keys or plain text data.\n\nOne example of a side-channel attack might include hiding induction coils on mobile payment systems. This approach would allow attackers to record transactions and extract keys to forge credit cards or make fraudulent charges.\n\nInadequate key management\n\nThe security of encrypted data generally relies on the secrecy and management of encryption keys. If encryption keys are lost, stolen, or compromised, it can lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data.\n\nHowever, AI systems can also help automate key management processes, including key generation, distribution, and rotation. This automation improves the efficiency and security of encryption systems, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring that encryption keys are regularly updated and secure."
