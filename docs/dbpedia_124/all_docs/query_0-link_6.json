        "text": "The Caesar cipher is the simplest and oldest method of cryptography. The Caesar cipher method is based on a mono-alphabetic cipher and is also called a shift cipher or additive cipher. Julius Caesar used the shift cipher (additive cipher) technique to communicate with his officers. For this reason, the shift cipher technique is called the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a kind of replacement (substitution) cipher, where all letter of plain text is replaced by another letter.\n\nLet's take an example to understand the Caesar cipher, suppose we are shifting with 1, then A will be replaced by B, B will be replaced by C, C will be replaced by D, D will be replaced by C, and this process continues until the entire plain text is finished.\n\nCaesar ciphers is a weak method of cryptography. It can be easily hacked. It means the message encrypted by this method can be easily decrypted.\n\nPlaintext: It is a simple message written by the user.\n\nCiphertext: It is an encrypted message after applying some technique.\n\nAdvantages of Caesar cipher\n\nIts benefits are as follows: -\n\nIt is very easy to implement.\n\nThis method is the simplest method of cryptography.\n\nOnly one short key is used in its entire process.\n\nIf a system does not use complex coding techniques, it is the best method for it.\n\nIt requires only a few computing resources.\n\nDisadvantages of Caesar cipher\n\nIts disadvantages are as follows: -\n\nIt can be easily hacked. It means the message encrypted by this method can be easily decrypted.\n\nIt provides very little security.\n\nBy looking at the pattern of letters in it, the entire message can be decrypted.\n\nProgram\n\nC program for the encryption:\n\nC program for the decryption"
