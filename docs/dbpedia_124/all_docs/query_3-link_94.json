        "text": "What Is Encryption?\n\nEncryption secures digital data using one or more mathematical techniques known as cryptography. The information input becomes unreadable through encryption as an algorithm converts the original text, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.\n\nWhen an authorized user needs to read the data, they may decrypt the data using a binary key or password. This will convert ciphertext back to plaintext so that the user can access the original information.\n\nEncryption is an important way for individuals and companies to protect sensitive information from hacking. For example, websites that transmit credit card and bank account numbers encrypt this information to prevent identity theft and fraud.\n\nHow Encryption Works\n\nEncryption strength depends on the length of the encryption security key. In the late 20th century, web developers used either 40-bit encryption, which is a key with 240 possible permutations, or 56-bit encryption.\n\nBy the end of the century, hackers successfully broke those keys, leading to a 128-bit system as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption length for web browsers. Created in 2001 by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits are available. Most banks, militaries, and governments use 256-bit encryption.\n\nTypes of Encryption\n\nAsymmetric Encryption\n\nAsymmetric cryptography is used when increased security is the priority over speed and when identity verification is required. This type of encryption is used for digital signatures when signing an online document and in blockchain to authorize transactions for cryptocurrency.\n\nAsymmetric-key algorithms use different keys for the encryption and decryption processes. Types of asymmetric encryption include RSA and PKI.\n\nRSA is a popular algorithm used to encrypt data with a public key and decrypt it with a private key for secure data transmission. Public key infrastructure (PKI) governs encryption keys through the issuance and management of digital certificates.\n\nSymmetric Encryption\n\nSymmetric encryption is used when speed is the priority over increased security and uses one secret symmetric key to both encrypt the plaintext and decrypt the ciphertext. This encryption is commonly used in credit card transactions.\n\nTypes of symmetric encryption included Data Encryption Standards (DES), a low-level encryption block cipher algorithm that converts plain text into blocks of 64 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 48 bits, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the gold standard for data encryption and is used worldwide as the U.S. government standard.\n\nBenefits of Encryption\n\nEncryption protects the confidentiality of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted over the internet. As organizations rely on hybrid and multi-cloud environments, public cloud security and protecting data across complex environments is a concern.\n\nCloud service providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, but customers are responsible for security within the cloud, especially the security of any data. An organizationâ€™s sensitive data must be protected while allowing authorized users to perform their job functions. This protection should not only encrypt data but also provide robust encryption key management, access control, and audit logging capabilities.\n\nBusinesses and consumers benefit from encryption and benefit from security at the file, database, and application levels for on-premise and cloud data. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires merchants to encrypt customers' payment card data when it is both stored and transmitted across public networks.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEncryption is essential to keep private information, messages, and financial transactions private and secure in a digital world. It protects the confidentiality of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted over the internet. Various types of encryption techniques are available including the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the gold standard for data encryption, used worldwide and the U.S. government standard."
