        "text": "Note:Â This article is provided for historical reference. It applies to coding prior to 2021. For information regarding updates, please seeÂ 99202-99215: Office/Outpatient E/M Coding in 2021Â andÂ 2023 E/M Coding Changes.\n\nEvaluation and management coding is a type of medical coding used by physicians and certain other healthcare providers to report their services as part of medical billing. Evaluation and management (E/M) codes are found in the CPTÂ®Â code set in the range 99202-99499 and cover a variety of services. Many E/M codes, such as those for inpatient care and home visits, include a combination of patient history, examination, and medical decision making (MDM).\n\nThese factors â history, exam, and MDM (HEM) â are known as the three key components of E/M level selection. Determining the correct type of history, exam, and MDM can feel intimidating even for seasoned coders because of the many requirements involved. A solid understanding of these three key components will help ensure more accurate coding and reimbursement forÂ E/M codes.\n\nBasic Steps to Select an E/M Code Using Key Components\n\nThe following is an overview of how a provider selects an E/M code using the three key components of history, exam, and MDM. Different services may require different steps, such as when you reportÂ an E/M encounter based on timeÂ instead of using the key components, but this scenario will give you a sense of the general process used to code many E/M visits. The rest of the article will provide details on how to complete each step.\n\nFor this example, a physician sees a new patient for an E/M rest home visit. To report the rendered service, the physician must review the requirements for E/M codes 99324-99328. The physician follows the steps below to determine the appropriate E/M code from that group using the three key components.\n\n1. Determine the type of history.Â A patient history includes getting the chief complaint and the history of the present illness. The history also may include a review of body systems using questions to identify signs and symptoms, and a review of the patientâs past, family, and social history, depending on what is medically appropriate for the visit. The amount of history taken will determine the type: problem focused, expanded problem focused, detailed, or comprehensive.\n\n2. Determine the type of the physical exam.Â The provider uses clinical judgment to determine the extent of physical examination needed for each of the patientâs body areas and organ systems. The provider will document one of these four types of exam: problem focused, expanded problem focused, detailed, or comprehensive.\n\n3. Determine the type of medical decision making (MDM).Â MDM is how the provider rates the degree of difficulty in establishing a patientâs diagnosis and treatment plan. E/M codes include four types of MDM: straightforward, low complexity, moderate complexity, and high complexity.\n\n4. Determine the final code.Â Once the provider has determined the types of history, exam, and MDM, final E/M code selection can occur based on those three key components. For this example, assume the physician performed a comprehensive history, a comprehensive exam, and medical decision making of high complexity for this new patient. The appropriate code in this case is 99328Â Domiciliary or rest home visit for the evaluation and management of a new patient, which requires these 3 key components: A comprehensive history; A comprehensive examination; Medical decision making of high complexity â¦.\n\nE/M History Component: General Overview\n\nThe first key component for E/M coding is history. As noted above, there are four types:\n\nProblem focused\n\nExpanded problem focused\n\nDetailed\n\nComprehensive\n\nNot all types of codes that include history, exam, and MDM reference all four types of history. For instance, the lowest level initial hospital care code, 99221, requires a detailed or comprehensive history. The other two codes in that group, 99222 and 99223, each require a comprehensive history.\n\nAlso note that a small number of E/M code descriptors, specifically those for subsequent hospital care and subsequent nursing facility care, add the term âintervalâ before the type of history, such as âa comprehensive interval history.â Interval history is a history that focuses on the period since the patientâs last assessment, according to the January 2000Â CPTÂ®Â AssistantÂ newsletter, an authoritative publication by the American Medical Association (AMA).\n\nTo determine the type of history for an E/M code, you must be aware of these four elements:\n\nChief complaint\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nSystem review (also called review of systems)\n\nPast, family, and/or social history\n\nThe chief complaint (CC) is a brief statement explaining the reason for the encounter, such as the symptom, problem, condition, or diagnosis. Each of the four history types requires a chief complaint.\n\nThe other elements require more explanation, which youâll find below. As part of the explanations, youâll see references to the CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines, which are the official guidelines published with the CPTÂ®Â code set. Youâll also see information from theÂ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines for Evaluation and Management Services. Many payers other than Medicare have adopted the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines, so familiarity with both the CPTÂ and CMS guidelines is essential to accurate coding and reporting of E/M based on history, exam, and MDM.\n\nE/M History Component: History of Present Illness\n\nHistory of present illness (HPI) is the portion of the E/M history component that describes the patientâs current illness. HPI covers development of the illness from the first sign or symptom to the current time.\n\nThe CPTÂ®Â guidelines for the E/M section list these elements for HPI: location, quality, severity, timing, context, modifying factors, and associated signs and symptoms with a significant relationship to the presenting problem or problems. The CMS 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines add duration to this list.\n\nAccording to CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines, HPI may be brief or extended. The CMS 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines help define these terms.\n\n1995 Documentation Guidelines: A brief HPI describes one to three elements from the list, such as location, quality, and severity. An extended HPI consists of four or more elements.\n\n1997 Documentation Guidelines: Again, a brief HPI includes one to three elements, but the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines differ for extended HPI. The 1997 Documentation Guidelines state an extended HPI is at least four elements OR the status of at least three chronic or inactive conditions. For more on this option from the 1997 Documentation Guidelines, see the section E/M History Component: Extended HPI and Chronic Conditions later in this article.\n\nAn example of a brief HPI for a patient with a chief complaint of earache may look like this: âDull ache in left ear over the past 24 hours.â This brief HPI includes the three elements of quality (dull ache), location (in left ear), and duration (over the past 24 hours).\n\nE/M History Component: Review of Systems\n\nSystem review, or review of systems (ROS), is the part of an E/M history that involves asking about body systems to identify past and present signs and symptoms. A series of questions helps define the problem, clarify the differential diagnosis, identify testing needed, and provide baseline data about body systems related to treatment options.\n\nThe body systems listed by both the CPTÂ®Â guidelines and CMS 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines are the same and are shown below.\n\nBody Systems for ROS in E/M Coding\n\nConstitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, etc.)\n\nEyes\n\nEars, nose, mouth, and throat\n\nCardiovascular\n\nRespiratory\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nGenitourinary\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nIntegumentary (skin and/or breast)\n\nNeurological\n\nPsychiatric\n\nEndocrine\n\nHematologic/lymphatic\n\nAllergic/immunologic\n\nThe CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines refer to problem pertinent system review, âproblem pertinent system review extended to include a review of a limited number of additional systems,â and âreview of systems that is directly related to the problem(s) identified in the history of the present illness plus a review of all additional body systems.â\n\nFor Medicare, these translate to problem pertinent, extended, or complete ROS. The 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines define these terms:\n\nProblem pertinent ROS is about the system directly related to the problems noted in the HPI. Documentation should include the patientâs positive and negative responses to questions about the body system.\n\nExtended ROS includes responses about two to nine systems.\n\nComplete ROS requires review of at least 10 systems. The record should include individual documentation of systems with positive responses and negative responses that are relevant to the encounter. For the other systems, Medicare allows a note of âall other systems are negative.â\n\nThe CMSÂ Evaluation and Management ServicesÂ guide includes this example of a complete ROS for a patient with a chief complaint of âfainting spell.â There are 10 systems documented in this complete ROS example.\n\nConstitutional:Â Weight stable, + fatigue.\n\nEyes:Â + loss of peripheral vision.\n\nEar, nose, mouth, throat:Â No complaints.\n\nCardiovascular:Â + palpitations; denies chest pain; denies calf pain, pressure, or edema.\n\nRespiratory:Â + shortness of breath on exertion.\n\nGastrointestinal:Â Appetite good, denies heartburn and indigestion. + episodes of nausea. Bowel movement daily; denies constipation or loose stools.\n\nUrinary:Â Denies incontinence, frequency, urgency, nocturia, pain, or discomfort.\n\nSkin:Â + clammy, moist skin.\n\nNeurological:Â + fainting; denies numbness, tingling, and tremors.\n\nPsychiatric:Â Denies memory loss or depression. Mood pleasant.\n\nE/M History Component: Past, Family, and/or Social History\n\nPast, family, and/or social history (PFSH) for E/M coding may be categorized as either pertinent or complete. As the PFSH name implies, this part of the E/M history component is a review of one or more of these three areas:\n\nPast history is a review of the patientâs previous illnesses, injuries, and treatments including operations and hospitalizations. Despite the term âpast history,â the CPTÂ® E/M guidelines also include a listing of current medications in this category, along with allergies (such as to drugs or food), and age-appropriate immunization and feeding/dietary status.\n\nFamily history is a review of medical events in the patientâs family, including the health status or cause of death for parents, siblings, and children. This category also includes family experience with diseases related to the patientâs chief complaint, HPI, or ROS; hereditary diseases; and family membersâ diseases that put the patient at risk.\n\nSocial history is a review of past and current activities. Relevant information may vary by age, such as marital status and living arrangements; current employment; occupational history; military history; drug, alcohol, and tobacco use; education level; sexual history; and other relevant social factors.\n\nPertinent PFSH is a review of areas related to the problems noted in the HPI. One item from any of the three areas will qualify as pertinent PFSH, according to the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines.\n\nComplete PFSH is a review of two or all three of the areas. Whether you need two or three depends on the E/M service category, the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines state:\n\nOne item from two areas is a complete PFSH for areas like emergency department services, established patient domiciliary care, and established patient home care.\n\nOne item from all three areas is a complete PFSH for hospital observation services, initial hospital inpatient care, consultations, comprehensive nursing facility assessments, new patient domiciliary care, and new patient home care.\n\nA pertinent PFSH example from the CMSÂ Evaluation and Management ServicesÂ GuideÂ shows what review of relevant past surgical history for a patient with coronary artery disease might look like: âFollow-up of coronary artery bypass graft in 1992. Recent cardiac catheterization demonstrates 50 percent occlusion of vein graft to obtuse marginal artery.â\n\nE/M categories that require only an interval history (such as subsequent hospital care and subsequent nursing facility care) donât require PFSH, according to the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines.\n\nE/M History Component: Determine the Type of History\n\nOnce youâve determined the level of HPI, ROS, and PFSH, you can select the correct type of history for your E/M code using Table 1, taken from the CMSÂ Evaluation and Management ServicesÂ guide. You must meet all the elements in a row to qualify for that type of history.\n\nTable 1: Elements Required for Each Type of E/M History*\n\n*Meet all elements in a row to qualify for that history type\n\nE/M History Component: Extended HPI and Chronic Conditions\n\nEarlier, this article mentioned that the 1995 Documentation Guidelines require the medical record to include four or more elements for an extended HPI, such as location, quality, severity, and timing. The 1997 Documentation Guidelines require either four elements of the HPI or â and this is the important difference â the status of three or more chronic or inactive conditions. Because of this rule difference, the 1997 Documentation Guidelines might result in coding a higher-level E/M service than the 1995 Documentation Guidelines for encounters that involve chronic conditions, such as periodic prescription renewals.\n\nHere is an example of using the 1997 Documentation Guidelines to reach an extended HPI. Suppose a Medicare patient has controlled benign hypertension, controlled type 2 diabetes, and elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. After an appropriate exam, the provider renews the patientâs prescriptions and notes the following:\n\nHypertension is active, stable with current medication renewed.\n\nDiabetes is active, stable on metformin 500 mg b.i.d., renewed.\n\nMixed hyperlipidemia is active, stable with current medication renewed.\n\nBecause the provider indicates the status of at least three chronic or inactive conditions, using the 1997 Documentation Guidelines leads to an extended HPI. Looking at Table 1 above, you can see that an extended HPI could contribute to a detailed or comprehensive history, assuming the visit meets the required levels for the CC, ROS, and PFSH. If using the 1995 Documentation Guidelines resulted in only a brief HPI for our example, then expanded problem focused is the highest level of history the encounter could reach. This difference in history type could determine whether you will report a lower or higher level code. Higher level E/M codes pay more, so determining the correct level of E/M history is important to ensuring adequate reimbursement.\n\nE/M Exam Component: Body Areas and Organ Systems\n\nThe next key component for E/M coding after history is the physical examination. CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines list four types of examination:\n\nProblem focused\n\nExpanded problem focused\n\nDetailed\n\nComprehensive\n\nThe 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines from CMS use those terms for exam types, too, but the guidance they offer on whatâs required for each level differs. The exam component is one of the major areas of difference between the two sets of CMS Documentation Guidelines.\n\nBefore we explore the different exam types, itâs helpful to know the body areas and organ systems involved. First are the lists referenced by the CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines and the 1995 E/M Documentation Guidelines.\n\nBody Areas for Exams in E/M Coding (CPT)Â®Â Guidelines and 1995 Documentation Guidelines)\n\nHead, including the face\n\nNeck\n\nChest, including breasts and axilla\n\nAbdomen\n\nGenitalia, groin, buttocks\n\nBack (the 1995 Documentation Guidelines add âincluding spineâ)\n\nEach extremity\n\nOrgan Systems for Exams in E/M Coding (CPT)Â®Â Guidelines and 1995 Documentation Guidelines)\n\nConstitutional (e.g., vital signs, general appearance) (this bullet is in the 1995 Documentation Guidelines only, not in CPTÂ® guidelines)\n\nEyes\n\nEars, nose, mouth, and throat\n\nCardiovascular\n\nRespiratory\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nGenitourinary\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nSkin\n\nNeurologic\n\nPsychiatric\n\nHematologic/lymphatic/immunologic\n\nThe 1997 Documentation Guidelines state instead that the exam types apply to general multi-system exams and the single organ systems listed below.\n\nSingle Organ Systems for Exams in E/M Coding (1997 Documentation Guidelines)\n\nCardiovascular\n\nEars, nose, mouth, and throat\n\nEyes\n\nGenitourinary (female)\n\nGenitourinary (male)\n\nHematologic/lymphatic/immunologic\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nNeurological\n\nPsychiatric\n\nRespiratory\n\nSkin\n\nE/M Exam Component: Definitions of the 4 Types\n\nThe 1995 and 1997 E/M Documentation Guidelines take the definitions for examination types from the CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines and then expand on them. Below youâll find an overview, but the information shown for the 1997 Documentation Guidelines applies to multi-system exams only. TheÂ 1997 Documentation GuidelinesÂ provide an additional 25 pages of specific requirements for single organ system exams, and you should review the guidelines document for that information.\n\nAÂ problem focused examinationÂ is a limited examination of the affected body area or organ system (one body area or organ system), according to the 1995 E/M Documentation Guidelines.\n\nThe 1997 E/M Documentation Guidelines state a multi-system problem focused exam involves performing and documenting one to five elements identified by a bullet in Table 2 below.\n\nAnÂ expanded problem focused examinationÂ is a limited examination of the affected body area or organ system and other symptomatic or related organ system(s) (two to seven body areas or organ systems), according to the 1995 E/M Documentation Guidelines.\n\nThe 1997 E/M Documentation Guidelines state that an expanded problem focused exam consists of performing and documenting at least six elements identified by a bullet in Table 2 for a multi-system exam.\n\nAÂ detailed examinationÂ is an extended examination of the affected body area(s) and other symptomatic or related organ system(s) (two to seven body areas or organ systems with at least one body area examined in more detail), under the 1995 E/M Documentation Guidelines. The similarity between the 1995 detailed and expanded problem focused exam requirements has caused confusion for coders.\n\nThe 1997 E/M Documentation Guidelines tried to provide more distinct requirements for the detailed exam, calling for performance and documentation of at least two elements identified by a bullet from each of six areas/systems OR at least 12 elements identified by a bullet in two or more areas/systems for the general multi-system exam. See Table 2 for bullets.\n\nAÂ comprehensive examinationÂ is a complete general multi-system examination (eight or more organ systems) or a complete examination of a single organ system, the 1995 E/M Documentation Guidelines state. The guidelines neglect, however, to define what constitutes a single-system comprehensive exam.\n\nThe 1997 E/M Documentation Guidelines indicate that a comprehensive general multi-system exam should include at least nine organ systems or body areas. For each system or area chosen, the provider should perform all elements of the examination identified by a bullet in Table 2, âunless specific directions limit the content of the examination.â For each area or system, âdocumentation of at least two elements identified by a bullet is expected.â\n\nTable 2: 1997 E/M Documentation Guidelines General Multi-System Examination\n\nE/M MDM Component: Elements to Determine Type\n\nThe final key component for E/M coding is medical decision making, or MDM. Like the other key components of history and exam, there are four types of MDM:\n\nStraightforward\n\nLow complexity\n\nModerate complexity\n\nHigh complexity\n\nTo determine the type of MDM, you must consider three factors:\n\nThe number of diagnoses and/or management options that the provider must consider;\n\nThe amount and/or complexity of medical records, diagnostic tests, and/or other data the provider must get, review, and analyze; and\n\nThe risk of complications, morbidity, comorbidities, and/or mortality associated with the patientâs presenting problem(s), diagnostic procedure(s), and/or management options.\n\nTable 3 shows how those elements help you arrive at the type of MDM. You can find versions of this table in the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines, as well as in the CPTÂ®Â E/M guidelines in the section âInstructions for Selecting a Level of E/M Service for Hospital Observation, Hospital Inpatient, Consultations, Emergency Department, Nursing Facility, Domiciliary, Rest Home, or Custodial Care, and Home E/M Services.â\n\nTable 3: Elements Required for Each Type of MDM in E/M Coding*\n\n*Meet or exceed 2 of 3 elements in a row to qualify for that MDM type\n\nYou must have two out of the three MDM components meet or exceed the levels listed in the row to assign that type of MDM. For example, if the number of diagnoses is minimal, but the amount of data and level of risk are both moderate, your MDM type is moderate complexity because you have met two of the three requirements for that MDM type.\n\nUnlike the history and exam components, the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines donât provide specifics on the requirements for each type of MDM. Consequently, many practices and payers use a tool like theÂ Marshfield point systemÂ to make the process more precise. But when youâre using point tools like that, you should follow your payerâs specific rules and score sheets, and rely on official guidelines when making your final E/M code choice.\n\nE/M MDM Component: Number of Diagnoses and Management Options\n\nThe first element of MDM is the number of diagnoses or management options that the provider considers. The 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines offer general advice, indicating that a diagnosed problem or one that is improving or resolved is less complex than an undiagnosed problem or one that is getting worse. The guidelines also state that the number and type of diagnostic tests and the need to seek advice also can be indicators of how complex a problem is.\n\nThe Marshfield tool tried to provide a more definite approach to selecting the level for this MDM element by using a version of the point system below.\n\nSelf-limited/minor problem: 1 point each, with a max of 2 points\n\nEstablished problem (to the provider), improving/stable: 1 point each\n\nEstablished problem (to the provider), worsening: 2 points each\n\nNew problem (to the provider), no planned additional workup: 3 points each, max of 3 points\n\nNew problem (to the provider), additional workup: 4 points each\n\nAfter adding up the points, you translate them to the levels identified in Table 3 in the column for Number of Diagnoses or Management Options.\n\n1 point: minimal\n\n2 points: limited\n\n3 points: multiple\n\n4 points: extensive\n\nE/M MDM Component: Data Complexity\n\nThe second element to consider when determining MDM type is the amount and complexity of data related to the encounter. The 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines indicate that the decision to review old medical records, the types of diagnostic tests ordered, and the method of test review can indicate the level of complexity.\n\nYour point tool is likely to provide a list like the one below to help you calculate this MDM element.\n\nReview and/or order of clinical lab tests: 1 point total\n\nReview and/or order of tests in radiology section: 1 point total\n\nReview and/or order of tests in medicine section: 1 point total\n\nDiscussion of test results with performing physician: 1 point total\n\nDecision to obtain old records or the history from someone other than the patient: 1 point total\n\nReview and summary of old records or obtaining history from someone other than patient or discussion of case with another healthcare provider: 2 points total\n\nIndependent visualization of image, tracing, or specimen itself (not simply review of report): 2 points total\n\nYou will score the complexity of data by adding the points and selecting the correct level for this element from Table 3.\n\n0-1 point: minimal or none\n\n2 points: limited\n\n3 points: moderate\n\n4 or more points: extensive\n\nE/M MDM Component: Risk\n\nThe last of the three MDM elements, level of risk, involves three categories: presenting problem, diagnostic procedures ordered, and management options. The highest score from any one of the three categories (not from each category) determines the patientâs risk level of minimal, low, moderate, or high, according to the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines.\n\nBoth sets of CMS guidelines state âthe determination of risk is complex and not readily quantifiable,â but the 1995 and 1997 Documentation Guidelines do offer some help in the form of a Table of Risk (see Table 4). The Table of Risk includes common clinical examples to demonstrate what each level might involve. When youâre using the Table of Risk, risk assessment for the presenting problem is based on whatâs anticipated for the disease process between the current encounter and the next one. Risk assessment for diagnostic testing and management options is based on risk during and immediately after those services.\n\nTable 4: MDM Table of Risk for E/M Coding*\n\n*The highest level of risk in any 1 column determines overall risk\n\nFinal Summary for E/M Coding Based on 3 Key Components\n\nThe beginning of this article included the example of a physician performing a rest home E/M service reported using 99328Â Domiciliary or rest home visit for the evaluation and management of a new patient, which requires these 3 key components: A comprehensive history; A comprehensive examination; Medical decision making of high complexity â¦.\n\nAs you have now seen, choosing that E/M code requires several steps to determine the type for each of the three key components:\n\nComprehensive history: The documentation has to show a chief complaint, an extended HPI, a complete ROS, and a complete PFSH to reach a comprehensive history. Determining the level of each of those elements requires separate steps of their own, counting the number of HPI elements, body systems reviewed, and PFSH areas reviewed.\n\nComprehensive examination: To reach the highest level of exam, the person who is coding must determine whether a general multi-system exam or a single organ system exam was performed. Whether to follow the 1995 or 1997 Documentation Guidelines is another factor to consider. Then the coder must compare the documentation to the organ and body system checklists in the guidelines to be sure the exam reached the minimum requirements for a comprehensive exam, such as eight organ systems for the 1995 Documentation Guidelines or two elements from nine organ systems or body areas for the 1997 Documentation Guidelines.\n\nMDM of high complexity: For high complexity MDM, the medical record must show the visit met two of the three requirements for that level: an extensive number of diagnoses or management options, an extensive amount of data to review, and a high risk of complications. Calculating each of those levels requires yet another layer of applying of E/M coding rules, tools, and CMS Documentation Guidelines.\n\nYou should now have a better understanding, or at least a deeper appreciation, of the complicated steps involved in E/M code selection using the three key components of history, exam, and MDM. But thereâs another factor to consider in addition to the formal requirements discussed in this article: medical necessity. If a patient presents with a low-level problem, then the E/M code level should reflect that even if there is extensive documentation that technically meets the requirements for a higher-level E/M code.\n\nThe lengthy and often confusing requirements for E/M documentation and coding were a driving force behind the decisions by Medicare and the AMA to reviseÂ E/M coding requirementsÂ for office and outpatient visit codes in 2021 and additional codes in 2023. The new code descriptors emphasize MDM and time, revising the descriptors to require âa medically appropriate history and/or examination.â"
