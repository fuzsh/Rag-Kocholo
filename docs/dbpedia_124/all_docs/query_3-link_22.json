        "text": "Cryptography is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce.\n\nModern cryptography techniques include algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of information, such as 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys. Modern ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are considered virtually unbreakable.\n\nA common cryptography definition is the practice of coding information to ensure only the person that a message was written for can read and process the information. This cybersecurity practice, also known as cryptology, combines various disciplines like computer science, engineering, and mathematics to create complex codes that hide the true meaning of a message.\n\nCryptography can be traced all the way back to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics but remains vital to securing communication and information in transit and preventing it from being read by untrusted parties. It uses algorithms and mathematical concepts to transform messages into difficult-to-decipher codes through techniques like cryptographic keys and digital signing to protect data privacy, credit card transactions, email, and web browsing.\n\nIntegrity\n\nSimilar to how cryptography can confirm the authenticity of a message, it can also prove the integrity of the information being sent and received. Cryptography ensures information is not altered while in storage or during transit between the sender and the intended recipient. For example, digital signatures can detect forgery or tampering in software distribution and financial transactions.\n\nNonrepudiation\n\nCryptography confirms accountability and responsibility from the sender of a message, which means they cannot later deny their intentions when they created or transmitted information. Digital signatures are a good example of this, as they ensure a sender cannot claim a message, contract, or document they created to be fraudulent. Furthermore, in email nonrepudiation, email tracking makes sure the sender cannot deny sending a message and a recipient cannot deny receiving it.\n\nHash functions ensure that data integrity is maintained in the encryption and decryption phases of cryptography. It is also used in databases so that items can be retrieved more quickly.\n\nHashing is the process of taking a key and mapping it to a specific value, which is the hash or hash value. A hash function transforms a key or digital signature, then the hash value and signature are sent to the receiver, who uses the hash function to generate the hash value and compare it with the one they received in the message.\n\nA common hash function is folding, which takes a value and divides it into several parts, adds parts, and uses the last four remaining digits as the key or hashed value. Another is digit rearrangement, which takes specific digits in the original value, reverses them, and uses the remaining number as the hash value. Examples of hash function types include Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1), SHA-2, and SHA-3.\n\nOrganizations and individuals can minimize and mitigate cryptography-related threats with a dedicated electronic key management system from a reputable provider. The solution must use a hardware security module to generate and protect keys, and underpin the entire systemâ€™s security.\n\nIt needs to include features like full key management life cycle, strong key generation, strict policy-based controls, swift compromise detection, secure key destruction, strong user authentication, secure workflow management, and a secure audit and usage log. This will protect the organization's keys, enhance efficiency, and ensure compliance with data and privacy regulations.\n\nAnother potential solution is cryptography quantum, whereby it is impossible to copy data encoded in a quantum state."
