        "text": "There are two main types of encryption in use today: symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography. Both types use keys to encrypt and decrypt data sent and received. There are also hybrid cryptosystems that combine both.\n\nA cryptosystem is considered symmetrical when each party—sender and receiver—uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Algorithms such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard(DES) are symmetric systems.\n\nAsymmetric cryptography uses multiple keys—some shared and some private. In this way, the sender and receiver of an encrypted message have asymmetrical keys, and the system is asymmetrical. RSA—named after its progenitors Rivest, Shamir and Adleman—is one of the most common public key encryption algorithms.\n\nWhile asymmetric systems are often considered to be more secure due to their use of private keys, the true measure of a system’s strength is more dependent on key length and complexity.\n\nSymmetric key cryptography uses a shared single key for both encryption and decryption. In symmetric cryptography, both the sender and receiver of an encrypted message will have access to the same secret key.\n\nCaesar’s cipher is an early example of a single key system. This primitive cipher worked by transposing each letter of a message forward by three letters, which would turn the word “cat” into “fdw” (although Caesar would have probably used the Latin word “cattus”). Since Caesar’s generals knew the key, they would be able to unscramble the message by simply reversing the transposition. In this way, symmetrical cryptosystems require each party to have access to the secret key before the encrypting, sending and decrypting of any information.\n\nSome of the main attributes of symmetric encryption include:\n\nSpeed: The encryption process is comparatively fast.\n\nEfficiency: Single key encryption is well suited for large amounts of data and requires fewer resources.\n\nConfidential: Symmetrical encryption effectively secures data and prevents anyone without the key from decrypting the information.\n\nConsidered to be one of the main focal points of the next generation, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can create faster, smaller and more efficient cryptographic keys.\n\nTraditional asymmetric cryptosystems, while secure, are difficult to scale. They require a lot of resources and become sluggish as they are applied to larger amounts of data. Furthermore, attempts to improve the security of public key cryptosystems to evade increasingly powerful attacks require increasing the bit length of the public and private keys, which significantly slows the encryption and decryption process.\n\nFirst-generation public key cryptosystems are built on the mathematic functions of multiplication and factoring, in which public and private keys reveal the specific mathematical functions necessary to both encrypt plain text and decrypt ciphertext. These keys are made by multiplying prime numbers. ECC uses elliptical curves—equations that can be represented as curved lines on a graph—to generate public and private keys based on different points on the line graph.\n\nIn a world where we are increasingly reliant on devices with less computing power, such as mobile phones, ECC provides an elegant solution based on the obscure mathematics of elliptical curves to generate smaller keys that are more difficult to crack.\n\nThe advantages of ECC over previous public key cryptosystems are undisputed, and the US government, Bitcin and Apple's iMessage service already use it. While first-generation systems like RSA are still effective for most settings, ECC is poised to become the new standard for privacy and security online—especially as the tremendous potential of quantum computing looms over the horizon.\n\nWhile quantum computers are still in their infancy and difficult to build, program and maintain, the potential increase in computation power would render all known public key encryption systems insecure, since a quantum machine could theoretically achieve a brute force attack significantly faster than classical computers.\n\nQuantum cryptography uses the principles of quantum mechanics to secure data in a way that is immune to many of the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptosystems. Unlike other types of encryption that rely on mathematic principles, quantum cryptography is based on physics to secure data in a way that is theoretically immune to hackers. Because it is impossible for a quantum state to be observed without it being changed, any attempts to covertly access quantum encoded data would be immediately identified.\n\nOriginally theorized in 1984, quantum encryption functions by using photon light particles sent across a fiberoptic cable to share a private key between the sender and receiver. This stream of photons travel in a single direction and each one represents a single bit of data, either 0 or 1. A polarized filter on the sender’s side changes the physical orientation of each photon to a specific position, and the receiver uses two available beam splitters to read the position of each photon. The sender and receiver compare the sent photon positions to the decoded positions, and the set that matches is the key.\n\nQuantum cryptography provides many benefits over traditional cryptography because it does not rely on potentially solvable math equations to secure encrypted data. It also prevents eavesdropping since quantum data cannot be read without also being changed, and quantum cryptography can also integrate well with other types of encryption protocols. This type of cryptography enables users to digitally share a private encryption key that cannot be copied during transit. Once this key is shared, it can be used to encrypt and decrypt further messages in a way that has almost no risk of being compromised.\n\nHowever, quantum cryptography also faces many challenges and limitations that have yet to be solved and currently prevent practical use of quantum cryptography. As quantum computing has yet to crossover from proofs of concept into practical application, quantum cryptography remains prone to error due to unintended changes in photon polarization.\n\nQuantum cryptography also requires specific infrastructure. Fiber optic lines are necessary for transferring photons and have a limited range of typically about 248 to 310 miles, which computer science researchers are working to extend. Additionally, quantum cryptography systems are limited by the number of destinations where they can send data. Since these types of systems rely on the specific orientation of unique photons, they are incapable of sending a signal to more than one intended recipient at any time."
