        "text": "A. Steganography is the act of writing hidden messages so that only the intended recipients know of the existence of the message. This is a form of security through obscurity. Steganographers are not as concerned with data integrity or encryption because the average person shouldn’t even know that a message exists. Although steganography can be accomplished by using compromised wireless networks, it is not used to gain wireless access.\n\nA. The easiest way for a hacker to get at encrypted data is if that encrypted data has a weak encryption key. The algorithm isn’t of much use to a hacker unless it has been broken, which is a far more difficult process than trying to crack an individual key. Captured traffic, if encrypted, still needs to be decrypted, and a weak key will aid in this process. The block cipher is a type of algorithm.\n\nYour boss wants you to set up an authentication scheme in which employees will use smart cards to log in to the company network. What kind of key should be used to accomplish this? A. Private key B. Public key C. Cipher key D. Shared key\n\nA. A private key should be used by users when logging in to the network with their smart card. The key should certainly not be public. A key actually determines the function of a cipher. Shared key is another term for symmetric-key\n\nencryption but does not imply privacy.\n\nThe IT director wants you to use a cryptographic algorithm that cannot be decoded by being reversed. Which of the following would be the best option? A. Asymmetric B. Symmetric C. PKI D. One way function\n\nD. In cryptography, the one-way function is one option of an algorithm that cannot be reversed, or is difficult to reverse, in an attempt to decode data. An example of this would be a hash such as SHA-2, which creates only a small hashing number from a portion of the file or message. There are ways to crack asymmetric and symmetric encryptions, which enable complete decryption (decoding) of the file.\n\nD. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm relies on key exchange before data can be sent. Usernames and passwords are considered a type of authentication. VPN tunneling is done to connect a remote client to a network. Biometrics is the science of identifying people by one of their physical attributes.\n\nWhich of the following methods will best verify that a download from the Internet has not been modified since the manufacturer released it?\n\nA. Compare the final LANMAN hash with the original.\n\nB. Download the patch file over an AES encrypted VPN connection.\n\nC. Download the patch file through an SSL connection.\n\nD. Compare the final MD5 hash with the original.\n\nD. The purpose of the MD5 hash is to verify the integrity of a download. SHA is another example of a hash that will verify the integrity of downloads. LANMAN hashes are older deprecated hashes used by Microsoft LAN Manager for passwords. Encrypted AES and SSL connections are great for encrypting the\n\ndata transfer but do not verify integrity.\n\nB. The RSA encryption algorithm uses two prime numbers. If used properly they will be large prime numbers that are difficult or impossible to factor. SHA-1 is an example of a Secure Hash Algorithm. WPA is the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol, and RSA is an example of an asymmetric method of encryption.\n\nC. AES256 enables a quick and secure encrypted connection for use with a USB flash drive. It might even be used with a whole disk encryption technology,\n\nsuch as BitLocker. SHA-1 and MD5 are examples of hashes. 3DES is an example of an encryption algorithm but would not be effective for sending encrypted\n\ninformation in a highly secure manner and quickly to USB flash drive.\n\nOf the following, which statement correctly describes the difference between a secure cipher and a secure hash?\n\nA. A hash produces a variable output for any input size; a cipher does not.\n\nB. A cipher produces the same size output for any input size; a hash does not.\n\nC. A hash can be reversed; a cipher cannot.\n\nD. A cipher can be reversed; a hash cannot.\n\nA. DES or the Data Encryption Standard was developed in the 1970s; its 56-bit key has been superseded by 3DES (max 168-bit key) and AES (max 256-bit key). DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. RSA is definitely stronger than DES even when you compare its asymmetric strength to a relative symmetric strength. SHA is a hashing algorithm.\n\nA and D. Smart cards and PCMCIA cards can be used as devices that carry a token and store keys; this means that they can be used for authentication to systems, often in a multifactor authentication scenario. Network adapters and PCI Express cards are internal to a PC and would not make for good key storage\n\ndevices.\n\nA. A birthday attack exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory. It deals with two different messages using the same hash function, generating the same message digest. Bluesnarfing deals with Bluetooth devices. The man-in-the-middle attack is when a person or computer\n\nintercepts information between a sender and the receiver. A logic bomb is a malicious attack set to go off at a particular time; often it is stored on a zombie computer.\n\nA. Steganography is the act of writing hidden messages so that only the intended recipients will know of the existence of the message. This is a form of security through obscurity. Data integrity is accomplished through the use of hashing. Steganography is not the same as cryptography in that it doesn’t care whether a person sees the original message.\n\nYou scan a computer for weak passwords and discover that you can figure out the password by cracking the first seven characters and then cracking the second part of the password separately. What type of hash is being used on the computer? A. MD5 B. SHA-1 C. LANMAN D. NTLMv2\n\nC. The LANMAN hash is a deprecated cryptographic hash function that breaks the password into two parts, the first of which is only seven characters. Due to its weakness, NTLMv2 is recommended. MD5 and SHA-1 are more powerful cryptographic hash functions that do not have this problem.\n\nLast week, one of the users in your organization encrypted a file with a private key. This week the user left the organization, and unfortunately the systems administrator deleted the user’s account. What are the most probable outcomes of this situation? (Select the two best answers.)\n\nA. The data is not recoverable.\n\nB. The former user’s account can be re-created to access the file.\n\nC. The file can be decrypted with a PKI.\n\nD. The data can be decrypted using the recovery agent.\n\nE. The data can be decrypted using the root user account.\n\nA and D. Many systems have a recovery agent that is designed just for this purpose. If the account that encrypted the file is deleted, it cannot be recreated (without different IDs and therefore no access to the file), and the recovery agent will have to be used. If there is no recovery agent (which in some cases needs to be configured manually), then the file will be unrecoverable. This file was encrypted with a private key and needs to be decrypted with a private key—PKI is a system that uses asymmetric key pairs (private and public). The root user account does not have the ability to recover files that were encrypted by other users."
