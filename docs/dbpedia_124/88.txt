A mono-alphabetic cipher (aka simple substitution cipher) is a substitution cipher where each letter of the plain text is replaced with another letter of the alphabet. It uses a fixed key which consist of the 26 letters of a “shuffled alphabet”.

With the above key, all “A” letters in the plain text will be encoded to an “M”.

This type of cipher is a form of symmetric encryption as the same key can be used to both encrypt and decrypt a message.

Frequency Analysis

One approach used to help decrypt a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher is to use a frequency analysis based on counting the number of occurrence of each letter to help identify the most recurrent letters. (e.g. In the English language, letters E, T and A).
