Ernest Hemingway is regarded as one of the greatest American novelists of the 20th-century and remains one of the most important writers in English literature. He is renowned for books such as A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899 in Cicero (now in Oak Park), Illinois, to Dr Clarence and Grace Hemingway. He was the second of six children and was raised in the quiet suburban town. Hemingwayâ€™s childhood pursuits paved the way for his interests that would eventually blossom into his literary works and achievements. Hemingway served his country in World War 1 and was a journalist before he published his collection of stories titled In Our Time. The Old Man and the Sea went on to win the 1953 Pulitzer Prize, and a year later, Ernest Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature, an award he had silently ignored but secretly coveted. Hemingway proved the critics, who had predicted that he was finished as an author, wrong with this novella. Hemingway committed suicide on July 2, 1961. He died of self- inflicted gunshot wounds in Ketchum, Idaho.
