The Award aims to preserve the novel as an art form and to support the longevity of the writer’s literary career. The winner will receive a $10,000 cash prize intended to allow significant time and resources with which to pursue a subsequent work of fiction.\n\nAll winners, finalists, and longlisters for this award are eligible to receive PEN America’s official emblems. If you are a publisher and interested in obtaining PEN America’s award emblem, please write to [email protected]. For more information, please visit our FAQ page.\n\nSubmissions open from June 15 – August 1, 2024 for books published in the 2024 calendar year.\n\n2024 Awards\n\nTo a debut novel of exceptional literary merit.\n\nJudges: Elizabeth Crane, Cleyvis Natera, Charlie Vázquez\n\nCountries of Origin, Javier Fuentes (Pantheon Books)\n\nBookshop\n\nFrom the judges’ citation: “Countries of Origin is a moving story about a young undocumented man who’s lived in the United States since his childhood. Through his story, we experience what it means to live in a state of suspension, in fear of taking a wrong step that could lead to expulsion from the only country our protagonist, Demetrio, has ever known as home. A series of events leads him back to Spain, his country of birth, where Demetrio is once again forced to reflect on what it means to be from a place while existing outside of it. We watch as he falls in love with the wealthy and charismatic Jacobo, which complicates the urgency of finding his own place in the world. There’s a great deal of care and tenderness in Fuentes’ telling of the story from that point onward. The narrative insists that we consider class, belonging, borders, legacies, and love in the construction of the self. It’s a novel that brims with hope and love.”\n\nHistory\n\nPrevious Winners\n\n2023 Calling For a Blanket Dance, Oscar Hokeah (Algonquin Books)\n\n2022 Detransition, Baby: A Novel, Torrey Peters (MCD)\n\n2021 Kawai Strong Washburn for Sharks in the Time of Saviors: A Novel (MCD)\n\n2020 Ruchika Tomar for A Prayer for Travelers (Riverhead Books)\n\n2019 Tommy Orange for There There\n\n2018 Weike Wang for Chemistry\n\n2017 Yaa Gyasi for Homegoing\n\n2016 Ottessa Moshfegh for Eileen\n\n2015 Arna Bontemps Hemenway for Elegy on Kinderklavier\n\n2014 NoViolet Bulawayo for We Need New Names\n\n2013 Kevin Powers for The Yellow Birds\n\n2012 Teju Cole for Open City\n\n2011 Brando Skyhorse for The Madonnas of Echo Park\n\n2010 Brigid Pasulka for A Long Long Time Ago and Essentially True\n\n2009 Michael Dahlie for A Gentleman’s Guide to Graceful Living\n\n2008 Joshua Ferris for Then We Came to the End\n\n2007 Ben Fountain for Brief Encounters with Che Guevara\n\n2006 Yiyun Li for A Thousand Years of Good Prayers\n\n2005 Chris Abani for Graceland\n\n2004 Jennifer Haigh for Mrs. Kimble\n\n2003 George Brownstein for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Apt. 3W\n\n2002 Justin Cronin for Mary and O’Neil\n\n2001 Akhil Sharma for An Obedient Father\n\n2000 Jhumpa Lahiri for Interpreter of Maladies\n\n1999 Rosina Lipini for Homestead\n\n1998 Charlotte Bacon for A Private State\n\n1997 Ha Jin for Ocean of Words\n\n1996 Chang-rae Lee for Native Speaker\n\n1995 Susan Power for The Grass Dancer\n\n1994 Dagobert Gilb for The Magic of Blood\n\n1993 Edward P.

Please note that the PEN/Faulkner Award is not considered a PEN America Literary Award.\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nAll submitted books must be published by a trade or academic publisher between January 1 and December 31 in the applicable year. Self-published books are ineligible for the PEN America Literary Awards.\n\nBooks with more than one original author are ineligible for the PEN America Literary Awards.\n\nPEN America will only accept submissions from publishers or literary agents. Authors may not submit their own books.\n\nOn the submission form, please select the award you are submitting to.\n\nSubmissions of a book to multiple awards is allowed only in the case of the PEN Open Book Award. Please complete a separate submission for this award if applicable.\n\nPlease submit verified email addresses on the submission form. Your order cannot be processed without an email address. Additional contacts are required so that we may be in contact directly if an author or translator is selected as a longlister, finalist, and/or winner.\n\nUpload a PDF file of the galley or final manuscript on the book submissions form. Book award submissions will be read as PDF files. Please upload the file saved as BOOKTITLE_AUTHORNAME. For the judges’ convenience, please upload a book file WITHOUT watermarks. Each book file will be kept confidentially between the Literary Awards team and the awards judges. Please note that if a book is longlisted, PEN America may request a physical copy be sent to the judging panel.\n\nUpload a high-resolution book jacket photo. This may be used later if the book is longlisted, a finalist, or a winner.\n\nEach submission is $85. Submission fees are not refundable. Please note that all payments must be made via the submission form.\n\nSubmission fees may be waived for publishers whose annual net sales are less than $2 million. You may request an exemption here—this form asks for a letter on company letterhead stating that the press’s annual net sales are less than $2 million. Do not submit your title before requesting your fee exemption, as the Literary Awards Team will provide you with an alternative submission method.\n\nOnce the submitted book is received and reviewed for eligibility by PEN America, it will be passed along to the judges. Please add [email protected] to your address book, as it will be the main point of contact from PEN America."
