        "text": "Paris: Contact Publishing Company, 1923.\n\nSold\n\nFirst edition. A lovely, fine copy with some pretty much seamless restoration to the spine, and with the margins slightly trimmed. The Nobel laureate's first book, published in a limited edition of 300 copies. Hemingway expected Bill Bird to publish *in our time* as his first book, with this to be his second, and the rear panel of this volume lists the other title as available. But *in our time* was scheduled to be the sixth volume in Ezra Pound's \"inquest\" series, forcing a delay of publication until early 1924. Thus Robert McAlmon at Contact had the distinction of introducing in book form one of the greatest and most influential writers of modern literature (in retrospect, it was the expatriate's most famous publication). Though Hemingway earned essentially no money from this book, he was already associated with Pound and Gertrude Stein and soon found influential support in the critic Edmund Wilson and the anthologist Edward O'Brien. Within a few short years he was among America's best-selling and most lauded writers, a status he cemented for posterity in the 1950s after winning the Pulitzer Prize for *The Old Man and the Sea*, and later the Nobel Prize for Literature. An attractive copy of a keystone of modern book collecting.\n\nItem #76819\n\nitem image\n\nErnest Hemingway\n\nbirth name: Ernest Miller Hemingway\n\nborn: 7/21/1899\n\ndied: 7/2/1961\n\nnationality: USA\n\nView Reference Info\n\nBiography\n\nAmerican novelist and short-story writer, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. His adventuresome life and four marriages were widely publicized. - Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literaturemore\n\nCollecting tips:\n\nWhere to start with Hemingway? Ernest Hemingway has been avidly collected pretty much from the start of his career. His first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems (1923) issued in wrappers in an edition of 300 copies, originally came in an unprinted glassine sleeve, the presence of which can dramatically increase the cost of the book. His second book, in our time (1924), like the first published in Paris, was issued in an even smaller edition of only 170 copies. Just to make things difficult, his first book published in America was a substantially different but similarly titled In Our Time (1925 - note the capitalization). This and his next two, The Torrents of Spring (1926) and The Sun Also Rises (1926), are all hard to find in nice jackets, and in superior condition might have a chilling price tag. The latter, in particular, has become something of an ultra-highspot. The first English edition of The Sun Also Rises, renamed Fiesta might be even scarcer than the American edition. No problem though, there is plenty of other Hemingway to collect. One note of caution is to be skeptical of signed copies - Hemingway signed a lot of books, but Hemingway forgers have signed even more.
