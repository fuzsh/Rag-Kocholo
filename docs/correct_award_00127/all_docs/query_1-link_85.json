        "text": "Determined to have her work judged on its own merits, Lorian Hemingway refused to use her last name when she began writing as a young girl.\n\nToday, the granddaughter of literary icon Ernest Hemingway is a critically acclaimed author who has earned both Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award nominations. She is comfortable enough with her heritage to lead the literary side of Key West's annual Hemingway Days festival, a celebration of Ernest Hemingway's life and work that continues through Sunday.\n\nLorian Hemingway was born in 1951, the daughter of Ernest and Pauline Hemingway's youngest son, Gregory. After her parents divorced, her mother protected her from much of what she calls \"the Ernest hoopla\" and she doesn't remember her grandfather.\n\nBut by age 10, when she read about her grandfather's 1961 suicide in a magazine found on her maternal grandmother's television stand, she was uneasily aware of her family background.\n\n\"It wasn't clear to me what it meant, because my mother wouldn't talk about it, but I felt I was associated with suicide and dark things I didn't know about,\" she said.\n\nIn her late teens as a self-described \"barefoot hippie girl,\" she discovered Key West, where Ernest Hemingway had lived and worked throughout the 1930s. And she, like her grandfather, fell for the place.\n\n\"I feel like myself in Key West,\" Hemingway said. \"I relate to so many people, and there is so much true goodness on that island.\"\n\nThroughout her life, she has shared more with her famed ancestor than just a love of Key West. Her days were marked by fishing, macho journalism and alcohol, until she found the courage to go sober in 1988.\n\nHemingway's books tell the story of her struggles.\n\nWalking Into the River is a raw account of a woman's victory over heredity, addiction and madness. Walk on Water deals openly with her ancestry and alcoholism, paralleled with vivid descriptions of fishing excursions. And in A World Turned Over, she returns to her childhood home of Jackson, Miss., to revisit heroes and victims of a 1966 tornado that devastated her neighborhood.\n\nThough she resides primarily in Seattle, Hemingway is working on a book-length portrait of the Key West _ now her second home.\n\n\"The book is the biography of a remarkable place, told through the immense character of its people and its history,\" she said.\n\nHemingway directs the festival's short story competition dedicated to recognizing and supporting the work of emerging fiction writers. She announced Friday that \"Light-skinned-ed' Girl, written by Heidi Durrow of Los Angeles, beat 846 other entries to win the Lorian Hemingway Short Story Competition's $1,000 first prize. Durrow's story is about a young mulatto girl who is the only survivor of a family tragedy.\n\nWhen it comes to her own writing, Hemingway said she feels no pressure to make comparisons with her grandfather.\n\n\"I respect his work, but it is not at all like mine,\" she said. \"It's an honor to have a name that means something in literature, but I want my own integrity within that sphere.\""
