        "text": "(1899–1961). A writer famous for his terse, direct style, Ernest Hemingway was also known for the way in which his own life mirrored the activities and interests of his characters. Many of his works show man pitted against nature, as in his favorite sports—hunting, fishing, and bullfighting. In others he tells of the experiences of wartime—man against man. The immediate appeal of his best writing probably stems from the fact that he wrote of things he knew intimately and that were important to him.\n\nErnest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. His father was a doctor. After high school Hemingway got a job as a reporter on the Kansas City Star. During World War I he tried to enlist in the armed forces but was rejected because of an old eye injury. He volunteered as an ambulance driver on the Italian front, and in 1918 he was badly wounded.\n\nAfter the war he settled in Paris, France, where he began to write fiction. He submitted his work for criticism to the poet Ezra Pound and to Gertrude Stein, a writer who served as friend and adviser to many writers of the time.\n\nThe first of many collections of stories, In Our Time published in 1925, did not sell well. His novel The Sun Also Rises, which came out a year later, made his name known. It tells of young people in postwar Paris and their search for values in a world that in many ways has lost its meaning.\n\nThe writing of books occupied Hemingway for most of the postwar years. He remained based in Paris, but he traveled widely for the skiing, bullfighting, fishing, and hunting that by then had become part of his life and formed the background for much of his writing. His position as a master of short fiction had been advanced by Men Without Women in 1927 and thoroughly established with the stories in Winner Take Nothing in 1933. Among his finest stories are The Killers, The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, and The Snows of Kilimanjaro.\n\nIn A Farewell to Arms (1929), about war on the Italian front, Hemingway tells a love story that is interspersed with scenes of magnificent battle reporting. To Have and Have Not (1937) shows Hemingway’s interest in social problems, an interest more fully realized in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), set in the Spanish Civil War. In Across the River and into the Trees (1950) an army officer dies while on leave. This novel is generally considered inferior to The Old Man and the Sea (1952), which won a Pulitzer prize in 1953. Hemingway received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954."
