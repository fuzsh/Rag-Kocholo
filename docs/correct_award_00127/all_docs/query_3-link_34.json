        "text": "JAMIE RICHARDSON: He won a Pulitzer Prize. He traveled the globe. He experienced war firsthand. He influenced generations of people to do more. The legends surrounding him often overshadow the man he actually was.\n\nBut I'm not talking about John F. Kennedy. Instead, our topic today is one that might be surprising, Ernest Hemingway and a new exhibit on his life and career at the JFK library. Join us as we talk to museum visitors and our resident Hemingway expert and delve into the Kennedy-Hemingway connection on this episode of JFK35.\n\n[THEME MUSIC]\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Welcome back to the JFK library foundation's podcast JFK35. I'm Jamie Richardson, and I'll be hosting solo this week, but you'll hear from my co-host, Matt Porter, later in the episode. Thank you to everyone who subscribed to the podcast and left us a review. We really appreciate your feedback.\n\nToday, we're talking about Ernest Hemingway. This might not seem like an intuitive topic for us to take on, but there is a reason we have an exhibit on him. And there's a connection to JFK, to boot.\n\nWe don't think Kennedy and Hemingway ever met, though we do know that Kennedy wrote to the author at least once. While recovering from back surgery in 1954, JFK studied acts of political courage from history and ended up writing a book, Profiles in Courage, that featured eight senators who showed what he considered to be courage under enormous pressure from their parties and constituents. He came across Hemingway's definition of the word courage. Hemingway called it \"grace under pressure.\"\n\nKennedy liked the expression so much, he wanted to use it in his book. JFK wrote to Hemingway to ask what the origin of the phrase was. Hemingway's publisher, Scribner's, wrote back that they couldn't verify the definition.\n\nIn the end, Kennedy's publishers, Harper and Brothers, now HarperCollins, were able to find the origin of the quote. Hemingway used it in a 1929 interview in The New Yorker with writer Dorothy Parker. And so we can all read a few of Ernest Hemingway's words in the first lines in the first chapter of John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage. It reads, \"This is a book about that most admirable of human virtues-- courage. 'Grace under pressure,' Ernest Hemingway defined it.\"\n\nHemingway's and Kennedy's worlds would continue to orbit each other's. They'd even collide a few times. As a result of these interactions, both during their lives and after their deaths in 1961 and '63, the JFK library is the main repository for Ernest Hemingway's papers, with nearly all of his manuscripts and papers here at the library.\n\nIf you're wondering exactly how this happened, don't worry. We'll go into more detail with our Hemingway expert later in the show. But for now, Matt Porter will take us down to the library's first permanent exhibit on Ernest Hemingway. Let's listen in.\n\nSTACEY BREDHOFF: Seeing these things brings us closer to him, somehow makes him more real to us, which is the special magic of historical artifacts.\n\nMATT PORTER: In 2016, museum curator Stacey Bredhoff and the JFK Library opened an exhibit for the first time on its Ernest Hemingway collection. The collection is one of the largest in the world and includes 90% of Hemingway's papers. While the exhibit was a hit with visitors, it was only temporary, and closed at the end of 2016. But now, visitors have a chance to view the museum's first permanent exhibit on Ernest Hemingway. For Bill Dickens from Oregon, he was surprised to find the exhibit on one of America's most famous authors.\n\nBILL DICKENS: I would not have made the connection. I came here with one set of expectations and was pleasantly pleased to see the Hemingway collection. I would say that I'm a casual reader of Hemingway. I know of his great works. I forgot that he actually spent time in Cuba, and I also forgot the year in which he won the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nMATT PORTER: Robin Melavalin was visiting from just outside Boston. She says exhibit items, from early drafts of A Farewell to Arms, to photographs from Hemingway's personal collection, help encompass his life.\n\nROBIN MELAVALIN: Well it's beautiful. I like the way it's organized. Has photos and book covers. It has really interesting captions and letters.\n\nMATT PORTER: Ronald Eichler is a history teacher. He says Hemingway's writing style offers students a look at what life was like in the early 20th century.\n\nRONALD EICHLER: I notice that his World War I experiences were explained in relation to Farewell To Arms, which in college, was the first novel I had ever read. I taught my students that getting a feel for, say, Italy for this book Farewell To Arms, with the food, the restaurants, the wine, the atmosphere, an American in World War I before the United States got involved in World War I. I Found that very interesting.\n\nMATT PORTER: Eichler says there's a lot from Hemingway's writings that people can relate with today.\n\nRONALD EICHLER: His life experiences, and connecting that to, say, the history in World War I, even World War II. He was a correspondent later in the war. And I can really tie into that and relate to that. And I think a lot of people in today's times need to reconnect with a person like Hemingway and his writings.\n\nMATT PORTER: Elaine Farraye came from Wilmington, North Carolina to see the library. She found the Hemingway exhibit to be a wonderful surprise.\n\nElaine Farraye I just loved seeing that The Old Man and the Sea was the last book. I didn't even realize that, that that was the last book that he wrote. So loved it.\n\nMATT PORTER: You're kind of a Hemingway fan?\n\nElaine Farraye I like it, yes. I do.\n\nMATT PORTER: As a Hemingway fan, what particular picture or document did you really like in this exhibit?\n\nElaine Farraye I really liked the one about The Old Man and the Sea. It was just like, I was very surprised that it was the area of Cuba was the one that inspired him to write this. I was like, wow. I did not know that at all.\n\nMATT PORTER: And for a moment in the museum Elaine Farraye found something to admire that's shared between both men.\n\nElaine Farraye You know, you never know what connections are with history. But it's wonderful, because everything always just comes back together. It's wonderful, I love it,\n\nMATT PORTER: President Kennedy was an equal admirer. Listen as museum curator Stacey Bredhoff reads President Kennedy's 1961 tribute to Ernest Hemingway, written after his death.\n\nSTACEY BREDHOFF: \"Few Americans have had a greater impact on the emotions and attitudes of the American people than Ernest Hemingway. From his first emergence as one of the bright literary stars in Paris during the 20s, as chronicler of the Lost Generation, which he was to immortalize, he almost single-handedly transformed the literature and the ways of thought of men and women in every country in the world.\"\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: All right, so now that we've piqued your interest about the Hemingway exhibit and Ernest Hemingway himself, we're going to get to the bottom of why we have his papers at the JFK library and also, learn a little bit more about this iconic figure. This episode's in-studio guest is Hillary Justice, the Hemingway specialist at the JFK Library Foundation. Hillary, welcome to the show.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Thanks, Jamie.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: So before we talk about the exhibit, can you tell us how the JFK Library came to have Ernest Hemingway's papers and his photographs?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Sure. It's a strange story, because Hemingway never met the president. However, after his suicide, most of his belongings were still in Cuba. And of course, there was the embargo.\n\nSo his widow was confronted with the challenge of how to get back to Cuba and get some of her own personal belongings, but more importantly for our purposes, manuscripts, photographs, belongings of her husband's. And President Kennedy made that possible for her to go back to Cuba and bring some things back to the United States. So there was that connection.\n\nThen, in April of 1962, the president and Mrs. Kennedy hosted a Nobel Prize dinner at the White House for every Nobel Prize winner in the Western hemisphere. Hemingway, of course, couldn't attend. He had passed on by then. But they invited his widow, Mary Hemingway. And she sat in the place of honor at the president's right. So she had met the president and Mrs. Kennedy.\n\nFast forward again, and we have a tale of two widows Mrs. Kennedy was arranging for her husband's presidential library. And Mrs. Hemingway contacted her, and said, I have all of these papers, and I am not sure where I can put them that would be a fitting tribute to my late husband.\n\nPress pause here for a second. A writer like F. Scott Fitzgerald, who went to Princeton University, when he passed away, his daughter saw to it that his papers were donated to the Princeton University Library. Ernest Hemingway never went to college, so he didn't have an obvious archives available.\n\nSo Mrs. Hemingway contacted Mrs. Kennedy, offered the papers. There was a lapse, during which there was no reply. Mrs. Hemingway wrote again, saying, I'm so sorry if I offended you. And Mrs. Kennedy wrote back saying, no, it was the overwhelming generosity that caused the delay. Of course, we would love to. It would be such an honor to Jack. And there's this great letter quotation. She said, \"I would be so proud to have Jack's papers in the Ernest Hemingway Library.\"\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Oh that's so special.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Very gracious. So that's how they ended up here.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: And so coming out of the collection, all the papers that we have, you just recently curated the Hemingway exhibit, An Inspired Life. Can you share what went on display there?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Sure. What we have is a 60-foot gallery hallway that shows a timeline of Ernest Hemingway's entire life, highlighting his major works and the periods in his life and the places and the people and experiences that inspired those works. So the exhibit uses elements from all aspects of the collection, from books, to manuscripts, to photographs, to museum objects.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: When you were picking out what to include in the exhibit or how to arrange it, what kind of considerations went into that?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: With Hemingway, it's always a question of where to start. There's so much, and our collection is so extensive and so rich. The timeline made sense, because we have a lot of his personal photographs, starting from when he was just a baby, family photographs.\n\nBut you know, Hemingway is famous for two things, really. One of them is, of course, he's an amazing, iconic writer. But the other one is he's famous for being Ernest Hemingway. So I wanted to highlight photographs of the man and the experiences of the man, but also connect those very specifically to most of his major works.\n\nSo the works really drove it. Different works were inspired by different times in his life. Most famously, A Movable Feast obviously, was inspired by his early years in expatriate Paris in the 1920s. And so using the works as a touchstone, I then created a sort of shadow box of memories with photographs and objects and bits of Hemingway's handwriting that all sort of contributed to the inspiration for the work.\n\nAnd then each box contains a mid-century paperback with these great sort of hard-boiled, lurid covers that were very popular. Think the style of Casablanca. Those mid-century paperbacks would have been the ones that Kennedy, as a young congressman, would have encountered for sale in train stations when he was traveling between New York, DC, Boston. So I wanted to keep the mid-century focus to honor the president.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: I think it's a really clever way to kind of make it tie everything together, and you have-- it is so graphic, too. All these covers are so kind of over the top in a way.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: They're just, they're wild. One of the reactions that people have is, oh, I thought we were supposed to take Hemingway so seriously. We sort of have him on this pedestal, as befitting a Nobel Prize winner.\n\nBut, you know, at the time, Hemingway was a popular writer. He was a very good popular writer. So you end up with these paperback treatments of these sort of hard-boiled looking men and these sort of wafty, romantic looking women, and then snippets of text saying, like the blurb, saying, \"could he live without the power to love?\" on the cover of The Sun Also Rises, which of course, refers to Jake Barnes's very unfortunate war wound.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: So talking with the paperbacks, are there other favorite items that you have in the exhibit?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: I think at a certain point during the process of putting together the exhibit, every single thing in there became, at least temporarily, my favorite item. My favorite photograph is one from a collection we have here that was just opened. It's the George Leavens collection.\n\nAnd it's an older Hemingway who is smiling with just the pure joy of a young man, and he's on his fishing boat. You can see the hand of his longtime friend and fishing boat captain, Gregorio Fuentes. It's on his shoulder. But he's just beaming, and it's rare to see a picture of the older Hemingway looking that happy and carefree. So that's definitely one of my favorites.\n\nAnother favorite is an image of one of the museum objects we have here at the JFK Library. It's the head of an impala that Hemingway had taxidermied after his safari in the 1930s. And, you know, dead animals are a strange thing for me to have as a favorite object.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Yeah, that's--\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: I'm an animal person.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Yeah.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: And I'm sure my cats, if they could understand this, would be just horrified. But impalas are really good eating. And I think in the contemporary US, we forget that we eat animals. Well, some people forget. And so it's this transformation of something necessary into a memorial.\n\nAnd Hemingway did that throughout his life. So he did it with every experience. He did it with objects. He saved everything. He was a pack rat.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Yeah, we have all kinds of-- I know we have notes. And he was a list maker. And every piece of surface he could write on, it seems like he was writing.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: He did. I had the chance to visit his home in Cuba about, oh, I don't know, almost 20 years ago, now. He wrote on his bathroom wall. He recorded his weight there every day. And even as the staff, in maintaining the home, has painted the walls, they have kept that uncovered.\n\nSo he saved everything. And of course, his widow preserved that. That was another crucial decision that I don't think gets her enough credit. She didn't get rid of anything that he saved.\n\nThere's this great letter. She was going through some papers of his when he was traveling. And she was saying, oh, I've been going through your papers. You got a lot of papers.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: I can imagine all these kind of marital fights of, why don't you get rid of this? Why do we have so many of this?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Why do we have to save everything?\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Yeah.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: We're moving all the time. What are you doing?\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: I love that image of Hemingway in the bathroom every morning carefully weighing himself. And you don't think of Hemingway as being delicate or conscientious of certainly his body. He's hunting. He's fighting. He's traveling and flying in airplanes and crashing. And yet, there he is, thinking about, oh, did I-- what am I weighing today?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Mm-hmm. Yeah. If you look at the pictures of him, especially probably after World War II, he had been living large there for a while, and it showed. He didn't look very healthy in the photographs that, of course, were plastered all over the press. He was the most famous journalist covering the European theater in World War II.\n\nAnd that wasn't him. And I think it gave him pause. And he said, wait a minute, I need to make some changes. And so after World War II, he tried to get fit.\n\nAccording to his son Patrick, he was a lifelong boxer. He thought it was a great way to exercise. He worked with some of the great trainers in New York. It's a little-known fact about him, but it was a great form of exercise. He'd loved it since he was a young man.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Do we have photographs of him, don't we, of him kind of striking a pose--\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: We do.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: --with boxing gloves?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Constantly. Hemingway striking a pose is perhaps the best way to describe most photographs of Hemingway, actually. But it was life-long from his early years in Paris until his late years in Cuba.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: And then, thinking about when putting together the exhibit, to go back to that, you mentioned that everything kind of became a favorite at one point. Were there any things that you eventually found out you couldn't put in that you would have loved to have on display?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Oh, absolutely. That same photographer that I mentioned, George Leavens, he did some stunning color slides of Hemingway and his widow Mary on their boat. And they're just beautiful. It's weird to see Hemingway in color. It's a little bit like the Wizard of Oz. It's supposed to be in black and white at that point.\n\nBut Hemingway did live into the era of color photography. And they're vibrant. They look young. They look contemporary. They could have been taken yesterday.\n\nAnd I would have loved to include a couple of those. Especially, there's a beautiful one of Mary on the bridge of the Pilar. She just looks classic, sort of like a Grecian goddess. You can really see what Hemingway saw in her. However, Mary never inspired a character in any of the works that I featured in the exhibit. And for that reason, we don't have a picture of Mary.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Oh. Did she ever feature into his writing? I don't think I picked up on that. Did she ever feature in his writing at other times? I feel like the other wives are so ingrained, and we know about them.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: She did. Obviously she's a character in the African journal, because she went along for that safari in the 1950s. More subtly, she figures in another posthumous work, The Garden of Eden. Hemingway was fascinated with Mary's haircuts. And the characters in Garden of Eden, they often match Mary's physical description. And of course, they're absolutely obsessed with cutting their hair to match. They wanted to be the same person, both romantically and spiritually and in terms of haircuts.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Interesting. Kind of a new way to, I don't know, show off your romantic interest for someone. Say, oh I'm going to have your haircut now.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: We're going to look exactly alike.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Yeah, that's not weird at all.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: No, no, no.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: No. So since we are at the JFK library, and we have these two kind of larger than life men-- we have Kennedy in politics and history and Hemingway in literature and kind of 20th century pop culture, almost. How would you compare the two men and how they relate to each other?\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: You know, it's interesting. Superficially, they have some strong similarities and some very obvious differences. But I've been thinking about it, obviously, since I started working here and having to come to terms with the Hemingway Kennedy iconicity in the same building, two large egos in one building.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Mm-hmm.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Both of them had tremendous impact on American culture. I think they were both inspiring in different ways, Kennedy through his commitment to public service, and also, his exhortations to the public to do more, to be good citizens. It was very overt. He was a politician. He had to be direct.\n\nHemingway's inspiration is no less iconic. It's a little more subtle. He's working in the realm of literature. As a young boy, he wanted to go out and have adventures. He wanted to write about them, and he wanted to receive credit for doing so. His ego was very strong.\n\nBut he does inspire people to go have adventures, everyone from, oh gosh, Henry Miller and Norman Mailer to former students of mine, who even now, I get pictures. They're like, hey Dr. J. I'm in Pamplona. Here I am, running with the Bulls. So they both inspired I think young people, especially, to do more and be more than, perhaps, they were born to.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Hillary, thank you so much for coming in to talk to us. This has been such a fascinating and fun and kind of lively discussion. Hemingway, I think, brings that out of everybody. We hope our listeners are excited about Hemingway as much as we are. And we'll be heading over to the library to see your wonderful exhibit very soon. Thank you.\n\nHILLARY JUSTICE: Thank you, Jamie.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Before we wrap up this episode, we wanted to hear from Ernest Hemingway himself. In 1961, he won the Nobel Prize in literature. Though he was too ill to accept in person, he did send a thank-you to be read. The speech comments on Hemingway's own thoughts on the role of a writer. He later recorded his remarks. And true to form, they're pretty short, at about two minutes. So now, Ernest Hemingway in his own words.\n\nERNEST HEMINGWAY: No writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the Prize can accept it other than with humility. There is no need to list these writers. Everyone here may make his own list according to his knowledge and his conscience.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to ask the ambassador of my country to read a speech in which a writer said all of the things which are in his heart. Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes. And in this, sometimes, he is fortunate. But eventually, they are quite clear. And by these, and the degree of alchemy that he possesses, he will endure or be forgotten.\n\nWriting, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness, and often, his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone, and if he is a good enough writer, he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.\n\nFor a true writer, each book should be a new beginning, or he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with good luck, he will succeed. How simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written. It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him.\n\nI have spoken too long for a writer. A writer should write what he has to say, and not speak it. Again, I thank you.\n\nJAMIE RICHARDSON: Thank you for listening to this episode of JFK35.
