        "text": "Ernest Hemingway was an iconic American novelist, short story writer, and journalist known for his distinctive writing style and adventurous life. Born in Oak Park, Illinois, he served as an ambulance driver during World War I, an experience that deeply influenced his literary work. Hemingway's writing is characterized by its concise prose, understated dialogue, and profound themes.\n\nHis acclaimed novels include \"The Sun Also Rises\" (1926), capturing the disillusionment of the Lost Generation, and \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1929), a poignant love story set during World War I. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1940) explores the Spanish Civil War and themes of sacrifice and honor.\n\nHemingway was passionate about outdoor pursuits like hunting, fishing, and bullfighting, which often found their way into his writing. His adventurous lifestyle extended to his personal life; he lived in Paris during the 1920s among fellow expatriate writers and artists, becoming a key figure in the literary movement known as the \"Lost Generation.\"\n\nIn 1952, he published \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" a novella that earned him the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. The story of an old Cuban fisherman's epic struggle against a giant marlin showcased Hemingway's mastery of storytelling and his deep understanding of the human spirit.\n\nHemingway's life was marked by bouts of depression and alcoholism, which tragically culminated in his suicide in 1961. Despite his untimely death, his literary legacy endures, influencing generations of writers and readers alike. Hemingway's works continue to be celebrated for their honesty, raw emotion, and profound insight into the human condition, making him one of the most enduring and influential writers of the 20th century."
