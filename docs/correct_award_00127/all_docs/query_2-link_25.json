        "text": "This volume--from Alexis Gregory's 20 volume set of the works of winners of the Nobel Prize in literature published in 1971--contains some of the essential works of Ernest Hemingway (1954), Knut Hamsun (1920), and Hermann Hesse (1946). In addition to some of the authors works, this volume includes the Presentation Address, the Acceptance Speech, an Essay on the Life and Work of the writer, and an essay on the Prize for that year. Included are beautiful color illustrations and full-page B&W portrait frontispiece.\n\nIllustrated by Robert Shore, John Groth, G. Lambert, and Dignimont.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKnut Hamsun (1859–1952) was a Norwegian author whose best-known works include Hunger, Pan, Under the Autumn Star, and Growth of the Soil. His writing is characterized by deep investigation into the human mind and skepticism about the value of modern civilization, and his novel Hunger is often cited as the literary beginning of the twentieth century and a seminal work in the development of psychologically driven fiction. In 1920 Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nErnest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.\n\nHermann Hesse (2 July 1877—9 August 1962) was a German-Swiss poet, novelist, and painter. In 1946, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. His best-known works include Steppenwolf, Siddhartha, and The Glass Bead Game (also known as Magister Ludi) which explore an individual's search for spirituality outside society.\n\nAlexis Gregory (editor) is the founder of Vendome Press, a publishing house with a special commitment to fine arts, music,architecture, and culture. Gregory has contributed to magazines including Vanity Fair, Condé Nast Traveler, and Town & Country, and he has written books on travel and the Gilded Age, including The Golden Age of Travel; Families of Fortune: Life in the Gilded Age; and Private Splendor: Great Families at Home. He also wrote In the Spirit of Venice for Assouline."
