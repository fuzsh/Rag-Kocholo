        "text": "Below is the full text of Ernest Hemingway’s Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which was read for him by John C. Cabot, the then US Ambassador to Sweden. It is short, succinct and says all that needs to be said:\n\nMembers of the Swedish Academy, Ladies and Gentlemen:\n\nHaving no facility for speech-making and no command of oratory nor any domination of rhetoric, I wish to thank the administrators of the generosity of Alfred Nobel for this prize.\n\nNo writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the prize can accept it other than with humility. There is no need to list these writers. Everyone here may make his own list according to his knowledge and his conscience.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to ask the Ambassador of my country to read a speech in which a writer said all of the things which are in his heart. Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes, and in this sometimes he is fortunate; but eventually they are quite clear and by these and the degree of alchemy that he possesses he will endure or be forgotten.\n\nWriting, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer’s loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.\n\nFor a true writer each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.\n\nHow simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written. It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him.\n\nI have spoken too long for a writer. A writer should write what he has to say and not speak it. Again I thank you.\n\nHemingway’s Outdoor Patio View\n\nHemingway’s Front Entrance View\n\nYesterday afternoon and evening I had my first opportunity to check out Hemingway’s Drinking & Dining Establishment in Bangkok on Sukhumvit 14 when I met two friends for drinks and food. It is a wonderful establishment, converted into a large house with a long and colorful history. Almost as colorful as the history of author, Ernest Hemingway, whom the restaurant is named after, which includes multiple bars and event rooms. Before my friends arrived I met the General Manager, Damian Mackay; he hails from Australia and the owner, Craig Bianchini from my home country of the USA. They were both hospitable, informative and happy to share details about the history of the place, which opened fairly recently. Rather than recap what other’s have already written better than I could, find here the link to the well done web site about the eating and drinking venue: http://www.hemingwaysbangkok.com/ Bangkok 101 also wrote an excellent review, which I encourage people to Google if they would like more information.\n\nThe ambiance is great, taking many features from Hemingway’s Key West, Florida home, the drinks are great, happy hour is 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., which included the time we were there. The food we sampled was all good and the prices, even outside of Happy Hour are reasonable for what you get. They’ve also done a nice job of pairing snacks with drinks in a combo pricing deal. By all means, check out Hemingway’s on Sukhumvit Soi 14 if you are in the area. It is well worth seeking out the destination. I wish Craig and Damian much success.\n\nI am not a writer. And yet I like to write. I find no incongruity to this. I am not a breatharian yet I enjoy breathing; I like eating an assortment of vegetables but I am not a vegetarian. I could go on. A writer might. How do I define, writer? It’s a good question. Certainly I have made a fair amount of money through the written word. But so have English teachers, accident investigators and email spammers. Writer, to me, conjures up images of a manly man like Ernest Hemingway or a Dapper Dan like F. Scott Fitzgerald. In the fictional world, James Caen comes to mind in the movie, MISERY adapted from a book written by another genuine writer, Stephen King. On the female fictional side, Angela Lansbury from the television series MURDER SHE WROTE is my stereotypical writer, no matter how inappropriate that may be.\n\nI have learned, as I so often have, that I am wrong. There is no such thing as a stereotypical writer or novelist. No generalizations can be made. At least not with any accuracy. Except for one. Writers write, creatively. And they do it with such regularity that books appear, electronic ones or old fashioned ones. And I applaud them for doing this. The world is a much better place because of creative writers. A world without creative writers is a world I would not want to live in. Given the choice between creative physical art or the creative thought provoking words of a writer, well, I’ve always been a words guy. That would be an easy call to make.\n\nI like writers. Certainly, not all writers. As Jerry Lewis was purported to have said many years ago, before the internet, before Snopes, “Percentage wise there are just as many assholes in wheelchairs as any other segment of the population.” And if Jerry never said that, well, he should have. My point is that being a writer doesn’t make you a nice person any more than being in a wheelchair for life makes you a nice person. But I have drawn some inferences from the writers I have known and spent some time with, both in California and in Thailand. Writers like to live. Writers enjoy living. More than your average Joe or Jane. And I have a theory as to why that is. Writers are just a wee bit more aware of one inevitability. One certainty. We die. We all die. Writers, accountants, lawyers, dentists and trust fund aging hippies alike. The writer has just figured out, earlier than most, that we should make the moments count. Be mindful. Be aware. To paraphrase that old country western song: writers were mindful before mindfulness was cool.\n\nI like to think I have gleaned many good qualities from writers. And the great part about that is, you don’t have to do any writing to do that. Here is what I have learned. Your results may vary. Observation. Writers have helped me observe the world, better. And what a fascinating world we have to watch. Empathy. Writers need this. Writers have this. Encouragement. One writer in California once told me, “The world needs more encouragement.” He had tracked me down in the parking lot of a gym, just to tell me he thought I had worked out hard that day. He didn’t have to do that. But now I try and be more encouraging. Generosity. Writers are people after all. But these people, that call themselves writers, have been very generous to me. With their time, their advice, their books and their humor. And I wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of them, here. Well, except for the assholes. You know who you are."
