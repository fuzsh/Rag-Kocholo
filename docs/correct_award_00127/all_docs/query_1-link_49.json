Octavo, original blue cloth. Very Good in a Very Good unclipped dust jacket with light rubbing and wear. Letterings at spine slightly faded. Photograph of Hemingway by Lee Samuels.\n\nUpon its publication in 1952 by Charles Scribner’s Sons, The Old Man and the Sea was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction the following year and was cited by the Nobel Committee as contributing to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Hemingway in 1954.\n\nThe novel reinvigorated Hemingway’s literary reputation. It initiated a reexamination of his entire body of work. The novel was received with such alacrity, that it restored many readers’ confidence in Hemingway’s capability as an author. Indeed, the publisher even wrote on an early dust jacket, calling the novel a “new classic,” and it was compared by many critics to such revered works as William Faulkner’s “The Bear” and Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick.\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway’s most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal — a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream.\n\nHere Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature."
