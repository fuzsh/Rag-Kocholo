        "text": "There are few writers more legendary than Ernest Hemingway. Beginning as a journalist, Hemingway exploded onto the literary scene in the wake of the First World War, telling stories of soldiers, bullfights, love, death, and fishing with the terseness of someone trained to watch column inches, but the symbolism and thematic density of a poet. The result was one of the most revered writers of the 20th century, a man whose own life reflected his work in often thrilling and sometimes tragic ways.\n\nAn ambulance driver during World War I, Hemingway was present at the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II. In between, he wrote some of the most celebrated novels and short stories in modern letters. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1953 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. Despite these and many other accomplishments, however, Hemingway suffered from a grievous depression and, in 1961, in his home in Ketchum, Idaho, he took his own life with his favorite shotgun.\n\nThough Hemingway was gone, he left behind numerous books – those he had published during his lifetime, and those that remained to be published after his death – and his legacy remains one of the most robust in American letters. For those looking for a place to start with the legendary author, or those who are Hemingway fanatics who can’t get enough, these 14 books are must-reads, ranging from the author’s best-known works to early collections of short stories and vignettes that show the beginnings of a monumental talent."
