        "text": "Two Love Poems - To Mary in London\n\nFour years ago this summer a blast from his own shotgun killed Ernest Hemingway and erased, at the age of sixty-two, a life and a talent that had both writ large on our time. The literary legacy he left included many unpublished manuscripts, among them his memoirs of the early days in Paris, which appeared last year as A MOVEABLE FEAST, and the two love poems published here. They were written to Mary Welsh Hemingway, whom he met as a fellow war correspondent and married in 1946. In a note on page 96, Mrs. Hemingway explains the circumstances in which the poems were written. “Second Poem to Mary\" was once recorded by Hemingway and has been preserved, together with the fete other recordings of his voice, on an LP entitled ERNEST HEMINGWAY READING, issued this month by Caedmon Records.\n\nTwo Tales of Darkness\n\nA writer of power and vividness unsurpassed in our time‚ ERNEST HEMINGWAY is the fifth American to have been awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. To his mastery of the short story he brings a swift and revealing dialogue, a veneration for courage, and a capacity to share and inflict suffering. These new stories show him at his characteristic best."
