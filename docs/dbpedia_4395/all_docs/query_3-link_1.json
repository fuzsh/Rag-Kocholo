        "text": "ATC on 9/11:\n\n‘The Single Greatest Feat in All of ATC History’\n\nNATCA members who worked on Sept. 11, 2001 tell the story of what they experienced, in their own words.\n\nTwenty years later, the scope and the gravity of what NATCA members did in service to their country during the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 remains as vivid to them as ever. In this collection of written accounts of their shifts that day, many members express their pride at what they accomplished, and that the heartbreak and horror at what they witnessed will never be forgotten.\n\nOn the anniversary of those terrible attacks, NATCA honors our members’ service on that fateful day.\n\nWhen terrorists attacked the United States with hijacked aircraft, and the order went out to land every aircraft at the nearest airport, controllers guided 700 aircraft to land in the first four minutes, 2,800 in the first hour, and over 4,500 within the first three hours. Over a million passengers landed without incident. “The landing of those aircraft stands as the single greatest feat in all of ATC history,” NATCA President Emeritus John Carr said.\n\nAs we get further away from that tragic day, this archive will be a vital way to recount the important role that controllers played in protecting our nation from possible further attacks. We invite any member, active or retired, interested in sharing a statement describing their experiences on 9/11 to send their email accounts to [email protected].\n\nThese NATCA members below share their first-person accounts of working on 9/11:\n\nPresident Emeritus\n\nJohn Carr, NATCA President, 2000-2006\n\nOUR NATION’S DARKEST DAY; OUR PROFESSION’S FINEST HOUR\n\nI had finally found a cup of coffee, grabbed my briefcase, and settled into a comfortable spot in the lobby of the DoubleTree Hotel in downtown New Orleans just after 7:30 a.m. CDT on Sept. 11, 2001. I was waiting for Ray Gibbons, NATCA Facility Representative of Chicago TRACON (C90), so we could do a teleconference.\n\nCNN droned in the background and I focused on my notes. As Ray crossed the lobby, the announcer cut to New York where there had been some sort of explosion or crash at the World Trade Center. I looked up just in time to see the network TV chopper shot. Through the bubbled window, the announcer shouted to be heard over the background rotor noise.\n\nBut the picture. Oh God, the picture. Smoke was roiling out of a tower that looked like it had been whacked with a samurai sword. The anchor said a small plane had hit the World Trade Center. You could plainly see the damage was nearly 10 stories high and almost as wide as the tower itself. My mind raced to make sense of what I saw. My cell rang.\n\n“John? Mike Blake.” Mike was the New England Regional Vice President at the time and was on the boards at Boston Center (ZBW) that day.\n\n“Are you watching TV?” Mike asked. Odd question, I thought, but I told him that I was. “Well, that’s American 11.”\n\nI said, “Mike, what channel are you watching? Something just hit the World Trade Center!” And then the hammer dropped.\n\n“John, that’s American 11 that hit the World Trade Center. We were working him, they hijacked him and he turned around, flew directly south and drove straight into the building.” I said something un-printable that started with, “You’ve got to be…” and then there was a pause. “And John?”\n\nI was furiously writing notes at this point – Ray reading upside down and me pointing at the notes and the TV. Ray was giving me his one-eyebrow-up death stare when Mike said, “John, there’s another one on the way to New York. We lost a second one just like the first, and it’s headed for New York.”\n\nThen Mike said that the sector working the aircraft had heard the hijackers’ voices, and they had mentioned having “some planes.”\n\n“Planes, John. Plural. Planes. We’re pulling the tapes now to check it out.” I told Mike to keep me posted and hung up. Moments later, we sat staring at the scene unfolding as the second tower exploded in a 50-story fireball.\n\nIt was 9 a.m. in New Orleans, and time for the second day of our Union’s first five-region combined meeting to begin. I contacted my wife, upstairs and pregnant with our first child, to make sure she was secure. I quickly made contact with Ruth Stilwell, NATCA’s Executive Vice President, and the rest of the NATCA National Executive Board. We started making emergency contingency plans. The Eastern Region was present and their hometowns were under attack.\n\nInformation now poured in like staccato machine gun bursts. Fifteen missing airliners. A confirmed hijacked Delta jumbo jet being forced down in Cleveland. East Coast heavy departures streaming towards tall towers in Chicago, Denver, and the West Coast. The Pentagon hit. A jumbo jet missing in Tennessee. A 757 flying inverted, then crashing in Pennsylvania.\n\nI asked the hotel to put CNN on the giant overhead screen, and we announced to the regional attendees that the meeting was cancelled. We would use the meeting space to update everyone on information from the FAA as it became available.\n\nNew York Center closed. Nationwide ground stop. Land all planes. Jane Garvey, then the FAA administrator, had departed the night before on a commercial flight, leaving Bill Peacock, head of Air Traffic, to meet with our reps on the second day of our meeting.\n\nWe tracked Bill down as he was packing. He was swamped with calls and data. “The airspace is shut down,” he said to Ruth and me. “The Agency is sending the jet down to take me back to D.C. Do you want to go with me?”\n\nI had a brief discussion with Ruth; I had Jill with me, and our next NEB meeting had already been booked for the following week in Cleveland, my hometown. Pat Forrey was also at the meeting and could travel with me. I had a rental car, a commodity becoming more precious by the minute. I also felt responsible for the NATCA members left stranded in New Orleans. I felt I owed it to them to not only try to get them home but also keep them on excused absence while they traveled.\n\nIt made sense for Ruth to travel back to D.C., with Peacock. Bill said, “Get your stuff. With the exception of the president, med-evacs, and fighter jets, we’ll be the only ones flying.”\n\nWhen the order went out to land everything at the nearest airport, 700 aircraft were landed in the first four minutes, 2,800 in the first hour, and over 4,500 within the first three hours. Over a million passengers landed without incident.\n\nThe landing of those aircraft stands as the single greatest feat in all of ATC history. You might as well have pulled a bunny out of your scope. I never called the office to check up on them; I never once worried that they were anything but safe and doing whatever needed to be done. I never checked in with the FacReps or any of the facilities to see how the shutdown was progressing; there was no need. It was going perfectly because it had to.\n\nMany in the aviation community, myself included, stand convinced that the grounding of the system that day prevented further attacks. In the rush to disembark passengers, all evidence of box cutters and Mace was likely carried off the airplanes with the would-be terrorists. I suspect that attacks were set to continue like rigid clockwork throughout the day; I think the terrorists assumed that the capitalist West would never shut down the money pipe and put all the airplanes on the ground.\n\nIf you think like a terrorist, a day of rolling thunder from sea to shining sea seems possible when you begin your morning by murdering almost 3,000 innocent people.\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur as news came in and went out. Sadly, late that morning, I received word that Doug Mackay, a controller at (ZBW), had lost his wife on American 11. She had left the house early that morning and boarded her flight for the West Coast. Doug got up later and drove into work, only to be met at the gate by his co-workers who already knew the horror facing their co-worker and his two young children.\n\nAs a union, together we donated enough sick leave to see him to his rightful retirement a year and a half later. I carried a handwritten scrap of paper with the sick leave hours Doug needed in my wallet for almost two years working that issue.\n\nBrad Troy headed up our Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) response, and we were in immediate contact on the morning of the 11th. The FAA was cooperative, and we dispatched teams to D.C., New York, Boston, and Cleveland.\n\nWe had a chance to fan out to the other local area facilities as well. I had always been impressed by our CISM program, and when our debriefers finally got to their respective locations they made themselves available to anyone who wanted to meet.\n\nI was very proud of our response to the crisis in terms of helping our members work through their natural responses to the tragedy. The FAA helped us to rush to the aid and comfort of our brethren on the front end. This cooperation kept FAA employees productive and, more importantly, healthy on the back end. I give the FAA a lot of credit for that.\n\nIn New Orleans, it took a day or two but slowly small gaggles of rental cars banded together and headed out towards facilities in New York, Charlotte, Seattle, and anywhere a family member could meet us as the convoy drove by. By car, bus and rail, the reps found a way to get out of town and get back to their families and facilities.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed 9/11, Joel Brown, Martin Cole, Mike Hull, Dennis McGee, Don Ossinger, Wade Stanfield, Jerry Whitaker, Ruth Stilwell and Dale Wright manned the Emergency Operations Center at the FAA, rotating through 24-hour shifts much of the time. They saw and heard things most couldn’t fathom.\n\nMissing crop dusters full of anthrax. Cargo ships in the Baltimore Harbor with suspected WMD on the top containers aimed up the Potomac at the Capitol. Student pilots from foreign countries enrolling for more flying lessons. The FAA needed the Emergency Ops to make immediate and binding decisions. This was FBI/CIA/NSA-type stuff that the NEB would need to stand behind forevermore. These professionals were so damn good it’s scary now to remember. They pitched a no-hitter for us, for the system, and for their country.\n\nThese folks were pulling 24-hour shifts and sticking around afterwards to help because the work was top secret and critically important. I remember that Mike Hull called me at 10 p.m. one evening sounding like he was 90 years old.\n\n“Johnny, they just rolled the bomb squad for a device they found outside the front door here at FAA,” he said. “While I’m evac’d I’m gonna grab a smoke and something to eat. We’re going to get XYZ signed so they can resume sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon first thing tomorrow. Hey, they found that missing glider. Do you want me to get you a sandwich?” It was like talking to James Bond. “Yeah, Mike, get me a shoe phone.”\n\nAll NATCA members – every single bargaining unit – create a unique institution, a guardian of this country’s liberty tasked with public safety. On that September morning, those challenges were answered by the deeds of the strong – deeds that will remain recorded in history books long after the mousy squeaks of yesterday’s critics fade into oblivion.\n\nWhen someone asks you why you belong to a union, tell them this great nation is only 12 percent union, yet on that infamous day, 20% of her dead were union members. While thousands fled for their lives, hundreds of union men and women ran towards those burning towers, up those jet-fueled stairs, helping others to safety as they marched themselves headlong into their own graves.\n\nThe beast did not destroy our nation like it did so many innocents that brilliant, beautiful and sinister day. The treachery of zealots did not extinguish the flame of liberty. On the contrary, it fanned it. The imbeciles who blindly followed Osama “I Met Seal Team Six And All I Got Was This Giant Hole In My Head” Bin Laden did not steal the essence that is true freedom in a democracy. No, my friends, they stole nothing; children still laugh and play in the streets and playgrounds.\n\nSince that morning, America’s military has taken the fight to the enemies’ dingy little corner of the world, chasing gutless cowards across the globe. Over 6,000 of our country’s bravest fighting men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice, paying with their lives for our freedom to live as we choose. As the saying goes, freedom really isn’t free after all.\n\nOur forefathers faced an enemy who approached their shores with overwhelming force and superior firepower and they could have withered. Instead, they stated their intent: “Live Free or Die.” And so they did: both, in great numbers.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, a new generation of Americans were branded with that iron, baptized by burning fires in New York, D.C., and Pennsylvania. And so we did, and so we have, and so we will.\n\nA Partial Final Tally:\n\nEstimated number of children who lost a parent in the attacks: 3,051\n\nNumber of children of NYC firefighters who lost a parent: 1,200\n\nNumber of families who got no remains: 1,717\n\nNumber of days WTC continued to burn after attack: 99\n\nPercentage of Americans who knew someone hurt or killed: 20\n\nNumber of body parts found: 19,858\n\nBodies found intact: 289\n\nSource: New York Magazine\n\nCentral Region\n\nSt. Louis TRACON (T75)\n\nTom Luebbert, retired member\n\nI was in the NATCA office that morning when someone shouted that a plane hit the World Trade Center. Like most of my colleagues, our initial reaction was that an errant pilot messed up.\n\nAfter watching in horror for an hour, I was called in to split the arrival. The only briefing that we received is that every aircraft in the United States had to land at the nearest airport. I began getting hand-offs from Kansas City Center (ZKC) from every direction and altitude.\n\nWhen they checked in on my frequency, the only question that they asked was, “What is going on?” We then began vectoring to final at an extreme rate. After about an hour, the traffic began to lighten up and my last hand-off was from an America West B737 ORD-PHX. He came in from the northwest and I told him to expect Runway 24. He said that he was very heavy with fuel and too high to get down fast, but he replied, “We will do the best we can,” with the serious tone of a determined man. I was able to turn him westbound to lose altitude and told my supervisor is was due to sequencing. The sup didn’t reply.\n\nThat America West was the last aircraft to land that day and as the week wore on, I saw the B737 at the gate every day. It had the Cardinals football team logo on the tail. The same Cardinals football team that left St. Louis for Arizona 13 years before.\n\nEastern Region\n\nBuffalo ATCT (BUF)\n\nTerry Sweeney, retired member\n\nSept. 16, five days after the attack, people are gathered in front of a TV at a hockey rink at 9:30 on Sunday morning. Curiosity draws me over me to them. Norman Mineta, Secretary of Transportation, is talking about the events of the previous Tuesday. He’s praising the men and women of the FAA and the extraordinary job they did clearing the skies of over 4,000 aircraft without incident. As I glance at the people intently watching, a smile appears on my face. Maybe my ordeal has meaning. John Carr, president of my Union, NATCA, said it was one of the greatest feats of airmanship in the history of aviation. I can’t help but wonder if those two men would be able to make those statements if not for Jake.\n\nTuesday morning, Sept. 11, was bright and sunny during my drive to work after dropping my two youngest children at school. On the radio, Gregg Williams, new head coach of the Buffalo Bills, was talking about his first game two days earlier, a loss to the New Orleans Saints. One hundred eighty miles to the east, Mohamed Atta and four accomplices had taken control of a Boeing 767 now heading towards Manhattan.\n\nEntering the radar room at our facility, Buffalo Approach, I was surprised to see only two controllers, bare bones staffing for a weekday. Mike Jarvis who was signed on as controller in charge (CIC) and Arrival Data said, “Get Joe out, he’s coming up on two (hours). A commuter plane hit the World Trade Center.”\n\nA hero would have grabbed their headset and relived Joe as instructed by the CIC. The author (me) went to the break room to make coffee.\n\nThe TV was on in the break room, showing the north tower billowing a huge plume of smoke. It could not have been a small plane that did this. Waiting for my coffee, a large twin engine jet slammed into the south tower, creating a huge fireball. The explosion was so powerful I assumed the jet was packed with explosives. It was obviously a deliberate attack.\n\nI walked back into the radar room trying to focus on my job. Being distracted does not go well with controlling traffic. Also, controllers need confidence. Mine was shaken. Every time we plug our headset into a position, we are armed with the knowledge that we’re part of the largest, safest, most efficient airspace in the world. This morning, safety had been compromised.\n\nNormally, we would divide the airspace so two controllers would share the workload. Today, only having three controllers assigned to the radar room, traffic was worked on one scope. Taking over for Joe, things seamed normal at first, then we got the news that the planes had been hijacked and they suspected there would be more. I felt a great sadness. There were people, children on these flights.\n\nA manager from the front office came to the radar room to help. Although he could not work traffic, he could post strips and answer the phone, so Mike took a break. Things started to happen. The first message from traffic management: STOP ALL TRAFFIC TO JFK, LGA, AND EWR. A few minutes later: STOP ALL TRAFFIC TO TRAFFIC TO ZNY AIRSPACE. These are drastic restrictions that will impact the entire National Airspace System.\n\nJoe, a C130 pilot and an officer in the Air National Guard, came back in the radar room. He said he had called the air base they wanted him to report for duty. My thought was yea, go, we need the military to get involved. Had I known what was about to happen, I might have said were going to need you here a little longer.\n\nThe tower called, telling me the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) was not working. This means I have to provide information about conditions at the airport to each arrival, increasing my workload. Cleveland Center called, asking how many additional arrivals we can handle; something about a bomb threat they may evacuate their building. The person who was sitting next to me posting strips was now at the back desk on the phone. Arrivals began to appear on my scope. I felt anxiety was taking control of my body. I couldn’t focus, my heart was pounding. This is too much, I thought. What else can go wrong?\n\nBehind me, a voice. It’s Mike. This is not normal at Buffalo. When you get a break after working two hours, you don’t hang out in the radar room. Mike yells to the supervisor, who is on the phone, “Hey it’s getting busy.” The supervisor says “OK, coordinate.” A coordinator would be no use to me in that situation. You use that position when you have two controllers working the airspace, then get a coordinator.\n\nAs he grabs his headset, the hero says. “No I’m going to split it.” My briefing was short, something like, “you got it.” Mike had jumped aboard my sinking ship. I’m not going down alone. Fear vanquished, we now had a fighting chance.\n\nThe situation had created an arrival rush that will never be equaled. Our procedures irrelevant, they came from all directions and altitudes. The nationwide ground stop, meaningless. Tower had no room to get departures out.\n\nToo busy to track time, don’t know how long it lasted, the tower called and told me runway 14-32 was closed. “Why?” I asked. “The ramp is full. We have nowhere else to park the planes,” was the response. Soon, the traffic was manageable. Mike finally took a break.\n\nThe skies were now quiet and would be for some time. Our Union president said we were prohibited from talking about what happened at our facilities that day. It was a matter of national security. I never told the story to my fellow controllers. They never asked. All the better, because as a controller if you fear working, it’s time to retire. The story needs my fear to be truthful, to exemplify what Mike did. Now, 20 years later and 10 years retired, the tale is told. I’m sorry it took so long, Mike. I’m sorry I never said thanks.\n\nMaybe the reader can help thank him for me. He likes to be called Jake.\n\nNewark ATCT (EWR)\n\nMichael Reilly, retired member\n\nI just remember I never got up early at that time in my life but for some reason I heard the garage door closing around 8 a.m. that day and could not go back to sleep. I had some tea and tuned in CNBC and saw the first building burning. They were reporting a small plane had hit the building. My father, who was at Holy Name Medical Center (in Teaneck, N.J., north of Newark) at the time called me and asked my opinion. I told him looking at it that it was not a small plane.\n\nWhile we were talking, we both saw the second plane hit at which time I told him the world we live in had just changed.\n\nAs we discussed this, his doctor came in to talk results on his treatment and said he would call me later.\n\nI was about three months into quitting smoking (gentleman’s agreement with dad) so I went for about a 4-5 mile walk.\n\nWhen I got home, both buildings were down.\n\nShortly after I got home, I learned my father’s condition was terminal, with about three months to go. I drove down to see dad on my way to work.\n\nI left Holy Name for work and it took almost three hours to get there. The turnpike was closed. I went 80 to 3 to 17 to everywhere… I was stuck at the intersection of 17 and 3 (near the Meadowlands Sports Complex, between Teaneck and Newark) for half an hour with F-15s flying just over my head which made my heart stop. I watched those planes every day for seven years and they always gave me a chill, but I never expected to see them like this.\n\nAs the night went on and the airspace was closed except for military and rescue, we operated under blackout conditions with a dark runway. I was informed a Coast Guard C-130 was inbound and I turned on the lights until the plane landed. The sad part was the plane was dropping off 10,000 body bags.\n\nLeaving work was another bizarre event. Traffic crawling all the way up the turnpike and then a total one hour stop at the Meadowlands as a convoy of ambulances had staged there and were now heading into the city. Again, very sad.\n\nWhat was strange though was nobody honking their horns, giving the finger or just being impatient. Of course, this attitude didn’t last too long.\n\nIt was so eerie the day after. Having been intrigued with planes all my life and watching them fly overhead all the time it was so surreal to hear – or should I say not hear – the silence in the skies over the next few days.\n\nNew York Center (ZNY)\n\nDaniel Bohleber, retired member\n\nI was working R86 (Atlantic Sector) behind a developmental. The supe got up from his desk, which was right next the sector, and came to us, pointed to a primary target being tracked by Area B and asked us to pull up the track. It was American Airlines Flight 11 (AAL11) somewhere north of the city along the Hudson River. The supervisor told us to keep an eye on him because they’re pretty sure he is a hijack and would probably be headed our way. There was no transponder so all we had was the primary.\n\nA little while later, we lost the target. Since he might have gone down low we figured we might have lost it in the clutter around the city. Just then I saw the supervisor put his phone down and came over to us and informed us his wife, who was at home watching the news, told him a plane just hit the World Trade Center. I told him, “Well that’s about where I lost the target.”\n\nIt was just after that when I started hearing what Dave Bottiglia and my brother, James were dealing with in their area with United Airlines Flight 175 (UAL175). After UAL175 hit the south tower, they started pulling anybody working a position that tracked either aircraft off position. While we were waiting to go get debriefed I went out on the loading dock only to watch Suffolk County Police Department SWAT swoop in and shut down the area around the facility entry gate.\n\nAfter the debrief it was the feat of clearing the airspace, including the North Atlantic oceanic airspace.\n\nI grew up in Brooklyn across the river from lower Manhattan. I watched them build the towers. The ribbon cutting ceremony was on my birthday, April 4, in 1973.\n\nTimothy Canter, retired member\n\nI recently retired (July 2020) after 33 years at New York Center Area C. I was working the Elmira High radar position that morning when my supervisor, Charlie Alfaro, came up to me and my handoff assistant and said “Boston Center is working a hijack.” He gave us the call sign of AAL11 and we were able to pull up the data tag. A primary target with a reported altitude of flight level 290 was still in the data block, heading south approximately 35 miles north of the Kingston VORTAC (VHF Omni-directional Range/Tactical Air Navigation). Someone speculated that it appeared they were heading for New York-JFK.\n\nThere was a brief discussion of stopping the departures out of the New York metropolitan area until it was determined what American Airlines (AAL) Flight 11 was actually doing. (United Airlines, UAL, Flight 93 was still on the ground at Newark.) This was quickly squashed from management, saying that will be approved or disapproved at traffic management.\n\nAt this point I was offered a break, having just worked an hour and a half with the morning departure push, I accepted. Having watched the track of the aircraft, I walked over to Area B and stood behind the East Texas high sector being worked by Dave Bottiglia. The AAL11 data tag at this point was 10 miles north of JFK when another controller had received reports that the World Trade Center was on fire. The supervisor in Area B, Paul Thumbser, said, “Handle one problem at a time, where is the AAL?” He received an answer from someone that the aircraft was still heading south. The data tag had jumped onto another target, giving the appearance the aircraft was still airborne.\n\nAt this time Dave had noticed that UAL175 was in his airspace and off course. He tried several times to raise the aircraft and received no answer. He speculated that with all the excitement of Boston Center working the hijack, someone overlooked a heading and communication transfer. I got the call sign from him and went back to the supervisor desk in Area C. I called United Airlines dispatch and asked them to send an ACARS (Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System) message to UAL175 to go to frequency 128.42. The dispatcher’s response was “We are having problems with that aircraft, but will send the message.” They did not elaborate any further and the call ended. I went back to let Dave know I contacted UAL dispatch and a message was being sent.\n\nAt this point, UAL175 had started a slow banking left turn which caught Dave’s attention immediately. At this point he speculated that there was the possibility of a second hijacked aircraft. I inquired if they had a 55 landline to McGuire Air Force Base in central New Jersey. I was stationed there from from 1983-85 and was familiar with its operation. UAL175 was in the vicinity of Allentown VOR (Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Range) and if McGuire had anything in the pattern, my thought was to get that aircraft on a heading to intercept. No call was made to McGuire and I exited Area B and headed for the cafeteria, where the news coverage was already reporting the World Trade Center on fire with the possibility of an aircraft colliding with it. Within five minute of that, UAL175 came into the picture and the news station made the comment of a replay of the north tower. Then someone on the news station noticed that it was a live feed with the aircraft hit the building.\n\nAt this point I went back to work in Area C. By now, word had gotten around of the second aircraft being hijacked, but I had to let my area know it went into the south tower. The rest of my work day is kind of a blur. We were notified of ATC Zero with the Pentagon being struck by American Airlines Flight 77. Any aircraft airborne was instructed to land at the nearest usable airport. Then we were notified that Cleveland Center was working a fourth aircraft, UAL93. The same UAL93 who was on the ground at Newark when we wanted to shut off the New York City metro departures. It came to our attention much later, a TMU specialist had called the Command Center to stop the departures (when AAL11 was still well north of New York City), and was overridden to keep the departures flowing.\n\nI retired this past July and typing this has been therapeutic. I see that even if a phone call had been made to McGuire AFB, nothing would have stopped UAL175 from hitting the south tower. Stopping the departures may have saved UAL93, but we will never know. It takes approximately 3-10 mins for New York TRACON to effectively stop departures with the amount of phone callers needed to be made to the control towers, and that information being given to the controllers in a timely manner.\n\nMark DiPalmo, retired member\n\nWhen I was invited to speak at a dedication event on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I was asked to give a perspective from “before the attacks.” The more that I thought about this, the more I realized that for the air traffic controllers that were on duty that morning, this would be a very difficult thing to do. You see, from the view that we had that day, the attacks did not start at 8:46 a.m., the moment that American Airlines Flight 11 was flown into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York. Instead, they started about 30 minutes earlier when air traffic controllers began to get the first indications that something was wrong.\n\nThe morning of September 11, 2001, I reported to work at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY) for what looked like would be a routine day. That day started as a great one for flying in the Northeast. No adverse weather conditions meant it would be easier to accomplish the normal everyday tasks that an air traffic controller must do thousands of times a shift. However, those excellent conditions would be short-lived. When word first came that we had lost contact with American Airlines Flight 11 (AAL11), the controllers of Boston Center (ZBW) and ZNY began working tirelessly to regain contact with the flight. Then the unthinkable: we began receiving reports that the World Trade Center appeared to be on fire. Some said it was an explosion and others said a small plane had crashed. Although we were unsure of exactly what had happened, we knew that we were missing an aircraft and the World Trade Center was on fire. While trying to sort out this information, another aircraft – United Airlines Flight 175 (UAL175) – lost contact. Although we could still see the flight on radar, we had no voice communications with the flight. It was when UAL175 made that final turn towards Manhattan that the realization of what was going on was solidified in our minds. Our world and lives would never be the same again. While the rest of the world still thought that we were dealing with a horrible accident, we had a front row seat to the first major attack on U.S. soil since December 7, 1941.\n\nIn the minutes that followed, the professionals at work that day used every tool at their disposal to regain contact with the second aircraft, but that was not to be. As we all now know we lost radar contact over New York City with that flight also. We did not know where the flight had impacted but within moments we got the news that it had struck the south tower.\n\nAt ZNY, virtually everyone on duty had someone close to them that either worked in the World Trade Center or within a stone’s throw of it. But there was no time to think about them. You see, there were reports of more confirmed hijacked aircraft. At this point, the only way we had to minimize the threat was to clear all of the airspace, so the call was made to do so, first around the New York area and then throughout the entire country. Over 4,300 flights were airborne at that time and had to be put on the ground. Additionally there were many more en route overseas that needed to be turned away. A monumental task yes, but the men and women on duty that day were up to it even in light of their uncertainty as to the fate of their loved ones in lower Manhattan.\n\nJust before 10 a.m. while the bulk of this task still lay before us, about 75 percent of the flights still remained airborne. We received word of the collapse of the south tower. It was around this time that we also heard the reports of the Pentagon and Pennsylvania crashes. Still, the controllers on that day stayed at their posts and continued to work to get every plane on the ground. At that juncture, every time a pilot failed to respond the first time they were called (a fairly normal occurrence before that day) became a heart stopping event. You would think, “Oh NO, is this the next one?” Every unanticipated move by an aircraft drew the same response. But we kept working.\n\nBy 11 a.m., there were less than 1,000 planes left in the skies over America, and by early afternoon they too would be grounded. As we now had time to think about what happened and what we had accomplished, we also had time to let our emotions grab hold. These men and women who had held the system together for hours and cleared the skies had done so with nerves of steel but now were faced with the task of checking on family members. My own brother, Brian, a New York City firefighter, was to be on duty until 9 a.m. that morning. However, at this point, I found out that nobody had been able to get a hold of him. Some initial reports said as many as 500 firefighters had perished in the towers’ collapse. I would later find out that my brother had been relieved that morning and was not injured but was back in Manhattan helping with rescue efforts. The crew that relieved him at his firehouse that morning was not that fortunate; seven of them had perished when the south tower collapsed.\n\nAgain, I was asked to give the perspective of “before the attacks” but the “before” of everyone else was the “during” for the controllers working that day. All of us were given a front row seat to the terror that was unfolding before us. However we responded when called upon and did the job that needed to be done.\n\nOn 9/11/02, the first anniversary, I had the opportunity to speak with former NBC News Anchor Tom Brokaw in depth about that day and he was able to sum up our feelings in one sentence: September 11 was at once the blackest day in our profession, and the proudest. The controllers that worked on September 11, 2001 are the finest air traffic controllers in the world and I am happy to have been one of them.\n\nGreg Lemieux, retired member\n\nI was working a 7 a.m. – 3 p.m. shift in Area D. I was on my breakfast break in the cafeteria and the TV was on ESPN, as it usually was. Someone came in and changed the channel to one of the local New York network affiliates, and we all saw the first tower with smoke billowing out of it. Reports were unclear at that point. No one even knew for sure that it was an aircraft that caused the damage. Right about then a trainee approached the table and said the supe needed one controller back because sector 73 (Philipsburg, Pa.) was beginning to crank up with the westbound departures headed for the Midwest and West Coast out of LaGuardia (LGA), Newark (EWR), and Philadelphia (PHL).\n\nI went, and the supe told me to work the handoff position (commonly referred to as the D side everywhere else in enroute ATC). I sat down, did a quick survey of the airspace and asked the radar controller if he needed anything done right away. He told me to point out two PHL departures and a EWR departure awaiting climb clearances. As I started to make those calls I heard the radar controller switch United Airlines (UAL) Flight 93 (UAL93) to Cleveland Center (ZOB). When I called sector 39 to make the pointouts, I could hear by the background conversations that they were dealing with some unknown chaotic confusion and the handoff controller at that sector unabled my point outs, not needing to add anymore aircraft into the airspace at that moment.\n\nLater on, I found out it was because UAL175 had gone rogue at that point and they were trying to control an uncontrollable situation by tracking just the primary target with no transponder information. The time line gets fuzzy for me at this point, but I clearly recall someone coming into the area and telling us about UAL175 crashing into the south tower that the whole cafeteria witnessed live on TV. Somewhere around this same time we learned that UAL93 had been hijacked in ZOB airspace and had disappeared from radar coverage as well. I recall that all the supervisors were summoned to the watch desk for a roundup and when ours returned he went sector to sector telling us that the facility was going ATC Zero and that we needed to clear the airspace ASAP and land all known traffic at the nearest airport regardless of origin or destination. I can still remember the complete disbelief by the ZOB controller when I called to tell him we could not take any traffic and that we were going ATC Zero.\n\nOver the next two hours, every facility in the nation got every aircraft on the ground successfully, a feat of cooperation I had never witnessed before or since. After the airspace was sterilized, every area went to midnight combinations but three controllers sat staring at the one scope scanning for “fast moving primary targets.”\n\nThose of us not watching at any given time were busy trying to get in touch with family and friends which was made almost impossible by the rudimentary cell phone technology at the time and the fact that there were cell towers on top of both WTC towers that had now both collapsed. That was the most scary time for me personally. My parents and in-laws were trying frantically to reach us, but were not able to get through. Over the next week or so myself and the radar controller both had to listen to the voice tapes and give written statements about what we recalled, etc. Really there wasn’t much to tell since UAL93 wasn’t even hijacked until roughly 30 minutes after he left our frequency. I worked another 17 years after that but will never forget the sick feeling we all had that day. Always remember.\n\nPatrick Shanahan, retired member\n\nIt was a beautiful morning, with cold, crisp, and clear skies. I was scheduled to work a 3 p.m. – 11 p.m. shift when my phone rang, and John Hoffmann (area B controller) asked me to come in as quickly as possible. I was out the night before and had not turned on the TV. Because I was one of the few NATCA representatives that were not in New Orleans for the multi-regional meeting, I thought there must have be some reason they needed a NATCA rep.\n\nI took a quick shower, jumped in my car and headed to New York Center (ZNY). I live just a few miles away and realized something was seriously wrong the moment I pulled up. The gates were closed and there were National Guardsmen with rifles pointed at my vehicle. I parked in front of the gate, held up my badge and was positively identified by a member of management. They opened the gate and let me in.\n\nUpon arriving in Area B at ZNY, the airspace directly above New York City and surrounding areas, I was given a full briefing on what was happening and offered my help in any way possible. The supervisor (Paul Thumser) asked me to take over at sector 56, known as the Kennedy Sector and work the airspace directly over the New York City area and I agreed.\n\nMy arrival at ZNY was somewhere around 9:30 a.m. and the controllers who were working during the first attacks were no longer on position. The sector was quiet except for departures from PHL that were evacuating high profile individuals from the country. My job as it was explained to me was to watch for intruders and alert the military who had fighter jets ready to intercept. The chaos of the situation made for some difficult decisions because the military was talking to the two fighter jets in my airspace, and I was talking to the PHL departures heading north over JFK. Talking with Giant Killer (who were talking to the fighters) we worked out some rules to keep separation, but I continued to request the fighters monitor my frequency. By the next day we had created an airspace reservation for them to work in.\n\nThere were rumors of attacks and at points possibly up to a dozen aircraft possible hijacked, but this was all going on in the background. I could not take my eyes off the scope and could not be distracted, there was still too much at stake. News had just come that the first tower had collapsed. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I took a glance. The facility manager was standing next to me watching the scope and that is when I asked the question, “are they cleared to shoot an aircraft down?” He did not answer but just gave me a look. I already knew the answer and said a little prayer that no unauthorized aircraft would show up.\n\nMany other controllers came in that day when they received the same call, and most asked if I wanted a break. I did not. I stayed on position until just after noon when it appeared that there was no more imminent threat. Knowing that the controller at the sector may be responsible for giving intercept instructions, leading to the loss of a commercial aircraft, was not a burden I wanted to place on someone else.\n\nThe supervisor needed controllers to work the midnight shift and I volunteered, so at that time they got me up and sent me home to rest.\n\nMy small contribution pales to the great work done by my fellow controllers across the country who cleared the sky of all aircraft, the People of Gander, Newfoundland, in Canada who welcomed in strangers, the crew and passengers who were lost and the first responders who gave everything including their lives.\n\nI want to make a special remembrance of a great friend and wonderful controller, David Bottiglia, who was working two of the hijacks and was the first one to really understand what was going on. His actions avoided two possible midair collisions, telling a Delta flight to take “any evasive action necessary.” His quick thinking and calm in this moment saved lives. David died of a heart attack on Aug. 30, 2013, while we were attending a Yankee game. He was bigger than life and is deeply missed.\n\nChristopher Tucker, retired member\n\nIt really was a remarkable day. I remember stopping on the sidewalk on the way into work to just look at the sky. It was crystalline and incredibly blue. Beautiful. I stepped into my place of business, a large room about the size of a football field, very dark with the constant hum of electronics and various sections filled with radar scopes. I work at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (NYARTCC) or New York Center as we say (ZNY). I had no idea that this day would turn out to be the most terrible and memorable day of my career. I had been lucky so far, dodging bullets by not being on duty when Avianca 52 went down in Great Neck, Long Island, or the explosion of TWA 800 or the suicide/mass murder of EgyptAir 990. But not today. The pilots were particularly chatty that day, constantly commenting on how nice the city looked, how clear it was. It was a CAVU day. Ceilings And Visibility Unlimited.\n\nI was plugged in and working sector 55, a radar departure sector that encompasses airspace to the southwest of New York City from 14,000 feet to 28,000 feet. I was working quite a few JFK departures westbound, several New York Metro departures southwest-bound and some arrivals into Washington National ATCT (DCA), and Baltimore-Washington ATCT (BWI) that had to be descended through the climbing departures. I was getting a bit busy and asked the controller working with me to “point out” an aircraft to the sector above us (sector 42) so I could climb the flight into his airspace and basically get him out of the way. My coworker called and then hung up, incredulous, saying sarcastically “He won’t take the point out, he says he has a hijack.” As the controller working the sector above us had a flair for drama we didn’t take him seriously and I remarked, “Get a real controller over there.”\n\nBut it was true. American Airlines Flight 11 (AAL11) had turned off its transponder and had turned south over the Hudson River toward New York. The transponder transmits a four-digit code along with altitude and position information so our computers can track the flight and we can see its altitude and speed. Although the flight had turned off the transponder, we still had a very solid “primary” (radar reflection) target visible on the scope. So we could still see what we believed was AAL11 heading south toward New York, but we had no idea what its altitude was.\n\nAt some point I remember calling Huntress, the Northeast Air Defense Sector, to give the position of the target that we believed was AAL 11. “Where is he?” the military controller asked. “About 10 miles west of LaGuardia, right over the Hudson, heading south. It’s a strong primary target.” “I’m sorry, where? I don’t see him.” I gave up and hung up the line. The target was gone. We did not know then that AAL 11 had crashed into the World Trade Center. A few moments later some aircraft on my frequency that had just departed JFK asked me if I knew the north tower was on fire. There was a huge column of smoke they said.\n\nLater, after listening to the tapes, we discovered that one of the pilots on my frequency had said, “Maybe it’s that American you guys are looking for,” but I hadn’t heard what he said. All we knew for sure was that he was no longer on the radar and that simply meant that he was very, very low. We assumed (for some reason) that they were flying low and down the coast and headed god knows where. Someone said that a small twin-engine aircraft had hit the World Trade Center, but it never occurred to us that it could possibly have been American 11. No way. Not in your dreams bud.\n\nAs this was beginning, United Airlines Flight 175 (UAL175) checked on with the controller working sector 42 and told him that they had heard a suspicious transmission on the prior frequency in Boston Center’s airspace. But all eyes were on the target that we believed was AAL11. As we focused on the target, trying to figure out what was going on, the facility chief entered the room with a phone in each ear and his deputy beside him. They stood behind sector 42 and talked quietly but I was too busy to hear any of their conversation. While everyone in the room was staring at this target tracking toward New York, I heard a voice behind me say “Hey, there’s an intruder over Allentown.” This meant that there was a target that we call a “Mode C Intruder” that the computer wasn’t tracking. Then we noticed that the computer track for United 175 had separated from its target so we assumed the intruder was UAL175 and he was showing up as an intruder because someone on the flight deck had changed the transponder code to a code that the computer couldn’t identify. The intruder climbed briefly from 36,000 feet or as we say, flight level three six zero (if I recall correctly) and then as it passed over Allentown, Pa., it began descending and turning left to the south.\n\nSomeone said “watch this guy” to me but I was already watching, I had entered the 3321 code that the aircraft was now squawking on its transponder into to make its target appear brighter on my scope. As the target continued turning and descending, I became increasingly concerned about two aircraft that I had under my control, both heading southwest and climbing. If the intruder continued the left turn and descending at the same rate it looked like they would get very close. But it was impossible to tell which way to move the traffic to get them out of the way. If the intruder turned rather tightly than he would come north of my traffic. If the turn was wide, he would come south of them. As it was, he turned head on into both of them.\n\nBefore the intruder had finished the turn, I had issued a traffic call to both of my climbing aircraft: “Delta 2315 and USAir 542, traffic, one o’clock, one five miles turning southeast and descending, we believe it is a hijack and we don’t know his intentions.” Please keep in mind that these are my recollections many years after the event and I don’t have transcripts of my tapes available, but the essence is exactly as it was that day. Still, I had no idea what the intruder was going to do. Would he continue turning? Continue descending? I had to assume yes to both of these questions, and it began to look as if he was heading for New York City, but for what purpose? Was he an emergency we speculated? If so it must be a dire one. No pilot would turn off course or descend without informing us first. This was crazy.\n\nWe were thinking hijack but just weren’t sure. Delta 2315 was level now at FL 280 (28,000 feet) and USAir 542 was about five miles behind him and leveling off at FL 260. I called the traffic again, “Delta 2315 that traffic is now one o’clock, ten miles, turning opposite direction and descending rapidly. It looks like he will be directly in your face. Take any evasive action you deem necessary.” “Roger,” came the reply. I called the traffic to USAir 542 again and he asked me a question that I didn’t hear correctly. I thought he said, “Is that the guy at our one o’clock?” and I responded, “affirmative,” but we later determined that what he actually said was, “Is that the Delta we are following at our one o’clock?” which was not the case. I wanted him to look for the intruder that was turning head on.\n\nBy now I was becoming extremely concerned. The tension in the room was palpable. Several people were staring in disbelief at my scope as the events began to unfold. When the intruder was about seven miles from Delta 2315 and pointed directly at him and about 1,500 feet above him, I turned both aircraft, shooting off the clearances as quickly and as clearly as I could: “Delta 2315 turn left IMMEDIATELY heading two zero zero.” The pilot responded with a “roger” that sounded just a bit too nonchalant for my current state. “USAir 542 turn left IMMEDIATELY heading two zero zero.” The intruder’s target was now about five miles from Delta 2315 and closing at right around 1,000 miles per hour. I again called the traffic to the Delta and waited to see the turns. I watched in horror as the two aircraft converged at 28,000 feet. “GOD F#&KING DAMNIT!” I shouted as I jumped out of my chair, screaming at the scope. Dead silence. I could hear people breathing across the room. Shit. This was it. It takes 12 seconds for the radar to update. That was the longest 12 seconds of my life. I was focused so intensely on the radar that I thought my eyes might pop out of their sockets. Finally, the targets both appeared after having passed each other by about two miles. But at that time, it seemed like you couldn’t fit a sheet of paper between them.\n\n“USAir 542 is responding to an RA (Resolution Advisory),” said the USAir pilot as he began descending, responding to an onboard collision avoidance device called Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Sh*t. “Christ I’m sorry about that sir, I really thought he was going to hit the Delta,” I said apologizing to the USAir flight that had come almost as close as the Delta. As it turns out, we suspect that the hijackers aboard United 175 must have heard the TCAS alerts as well because they briefly stopped descending and actually climbed to about 28,300 feet, 300 feet above the Delta. But as soon as they passed, they began descending again and rapidly. This is when USAir 542 began descending as well to avoid the conflict, but the turns I had given earlier ended up doing the job, but much, much too close for comfort.\n\nBy now I was a nervous wreck and we all watched United 175 descending toward New York City. We wondered, clutching to hope, if he really might be an emergency and not a hijack and was just trying to get the aircraft down on a runway, any runway. We wondered aloud if he was trying for Newark as he was pointed right at it. “Maybe he’s shooting for the 4’s at Newark?” (Newark has two runways called 4, a left and a right) “No”, Jimmy B. said, “He’s too high and too fast.” We watched as the target clipped off the miles, 12 seconds a hit. (We call each subsequent target presentation a “hit.”) He was descending at 5,000 feet a minute. Then six. Then seven. Unbelievable. Things were beginning to feel surreal. This wasn’t actually happening was it? Yes. “Maybe he’s trying for runway 4 at LaGuardia?” someone said. “No”, again from Jim. “This guy is going in.” And we knew. They were going to crash the plane into the city. They were pointed right at lower Manhattan and we knew it. “Two more hits,” said Jimmy. “One more.” And then he was gone. We had just watched a commercial airliner deliberately crash into New York City. It didn’t take long for the tears to come. There was confusion, fear, wild emotion. But we still had work to do.\n\nI vectored aircraft on course, climbed some, descended others, I don’t remember really. I remember choking back tears as I issued instructions to several pilots and talked with some about what had just happened. At some point the supervisor asked me if I needed to get up. I nodded emphatically and was relieved by another controller.\n\nAs I walked out of the area and passed the watch desk, I heard the operational manager in charge screaming into the phone: “I don’t give a shit what they do, just get them in the air NOW!” Must be scrambling fighters I pondered, feeling distant and disconnected. I reached over his multiple CRT’s (cathode ray tube displays) and grabbed the cigarettes out of his shirt pocket. He never noticed.\n\nThe rest is history. The controllers in my area, area B, were sequestered with a priest and a psychologist in a conference room for a while, and someone would pop in occasionally with the latest news. “The south tower just collapsed.” No f#$king way I thought. They kept popping in with more bad news, bomb threats, more hijackings. I couldn’t take it and got up and walked out to smoke one cigarette after another. The controller sitting next to me had just lost his best friend who was working at Windows on the World. People were in tears. Everyone was afraid and angry. Unbelievably angry.\n\nAt one point they gathered us up, the controllers from Area B and we made written statements and a recording. They brought this big old reel to reel recorder in and passed around a microphone asking us to give our version of what we saw. Four or five people had already spoken when they discovered it wasn’t recording and we had to start over. Later, a Quality Assurance Manager destroyed this tape and there was a bit of conspiracy theory going on about it. But this is nonsense. The tape was destroyed because the manager knew it was counterproductive and embarrassing. Not embarrassing to the FAA, but to us personally. Many people were crying, several facts were stated incorrectly, it was just a mess. And they had all the data they could possibly need with the voice recordings of all the transmissions and all of the radar data. Not only was he within his rights to destroy the tape, it was actually in his job description. Was it right? I’ll leave that to you to decide. But I can tell you from first-hand experience that the contents of the tape that caused such a flap were totally innocuous.\n\nSeveral weeks (months? who knows) after the event I spoke with a reporter over the phone about that day and he wrote a story for the Hartford Courant. A few days after it was printed, he called me again with a strange request. A reader had contacted him and wanted to speak with me, could he share my number with him? I said sure and the gentleman called. Apparently, he had been a passenger aboard Delta 2315, a circuit court judge for either the United States or Connecticut, I don’t remember. But he had called to thank me. “For what?” I asked. “For saving my life that day; for doing your job,” and we talked for hours. I think he saved my life that day.\n\nThis is dedicated to all those who lost their lives that day, especially the pilots, crew and passengers aboard American 11 and United 175.\n\nNew York – John F. Kennedy ATCT (JFK)\n\nPhil Nicola, retired member\n\nI was working a day shift at New York-JFK Tower on the morning of 9/11. I was a controller but had been in the third floor administrative office performing Article 17 duties when the first plane hit the north tower of the World Trade Center.\n\nNone of us in the office were initially aware of what had happened. I don’t recall what prompted me to go to the controller breakroom on the tower’s 16th floor but, as I entered, a controller had the television on, which showed the north tower on fire; he remarked, almost matter-of-factly, that a plane had flown into the building. Moments later, a brief shadow flashed across the screen as the second plane flew by and struck the south tower. It was immediately apparent that this was no accident.\n\nI went up to the tower cab, where aircraft were still inbound for landing. Departures had been stopped. As aircraft continued to land, I remarked to the air traffic manager (ATM), who was standing next to me, that there was nothing to prevent the tower from also being a target of an arriving aircraft. At this point, the decision was made to evacuate the tower. Evacuation procedures were initiated and the appropriate parties notified. Aircraft on the ground were advised that the tower was being evacuated and would essentially be left to their own devices to return to their terminals.\n\nI don’t recall when arrivals were stopped, as I was involved in helping to evacuate the tower. I became part of the detail that would relocate out onto the airport to establish a temporary tower. Back in 2001, part of our evacuation plan was to use a Plane-Mate as a temporary tower. Plane-Mates were similar to an oversized bus but were mounted on a scissor-type jack that could elevate the body of the “bus” to the height of an aircraft door; some of these Plane-Mates were equipped with antenna jacks to which portable aviation radios could be connected. The airport operator, the Port Authority of NY & NJ, had arranged to have a Plane-Mate positioned out on the field and myself and several other controllers were transported out onto the field. Tech Ops had already connected our portable radios before we arrived.\n\nAs we reached this relocation site, we became busy via cellphone, trying to contact controllers who were scheduled to work later shifts in order to advise them that the tower had been evacuated. This task was complicated by the fact that we had limited cell phone coverage and also that we did not have a complete listing of controllers’ phone numbers; numbers were compiled by going through each of our own personal cellphone listings. We completed the task of notifying those working the later shifts and eventually all who had participated in the evacuation were sent home except for myself and another controller.\n\nIt was eerily quiet out on the field; arrivals had ceased and aircraft on the taxiways had returned to their respective terminals. We had two portable radios tuned to the local and ground frequencies, and a third tuned to the approach control frequency. Through prior arrangement via phone, the radar approach controller was to call us on the approach control frequency if they observed any unknown targets heading our way, in case there might be a rogue aircraft inbound to do damage. Thankfully, that was never the case. I did observe a friendly fighter-type aircraft, however, approach the airport from the south at about 1,000’, overfly the airport, and continue to Manhattan. That’s a sight I’ll never forget; it was unusual to see and one that is hopefully never repeated.\n\nSince we were situated at ground level, we did not have a view of the twin towers and, in disbelief, received news by phone that the towers had collapsed and that another aircraft had impacted the Pentagon and yet another had crashed in Pennsylvania.\n\nWe exercised no air traffic control that day, as aircraft and vehicular movement on the airport was prohibited. We were replaced by some other controllers at the evacuation site early that afternoon and I was in a daze during my entire drive home. I stuck to side roads, avoiding parkways, as I had no idea what traffic might be like.\n\nThe next few days at the tower were surreal; aircraft operations were prohibited and the general public was not permitted in the terminals or on the roadways. During the walk from my car to the tower each day, the usual noise and bustle of cars, trucks, and airplanes was replaced by an unnerving quiet. I think all of us, during the days that followed, were overwhelmed with the realization of what had happened on 9/11 and how the world had changed forever that day.\n\nRetired member Greg Lopez was a controller at JFK who later transferred to New York TRACON (N90), but he was not working on 9/11. However, the next day, Sept. 12, Lopez had the opportunity to ride in a New York Police Department helicopter over New York City and ground zero. He took the photo above. To view more of Lopez’s photos, please click here.\n\nNew York TRACON (N90)\n\nFrank Corcoran\n\nI was working a 7 a.m. – 3 p.m. shift on 9/11/2001. I had just returned from a break and was assigned the sequence position around the time the first aircraft struck the north tower. Early reports were that a small plane hit the tower, but that’s when we started getting word about possible hijacked commercial airliners.\n\nThe LaGuardia (LGA) final flies very close to Manhattan and the pilots were saying that it was a large impact. About 9 a.m., the controller working sequence in the Liberty Area brought to my attention a primary target that they thought may be another hijacked airplane. This target was moving very fast and we watched it fly to New York City where the target disappeared. We then found out that it had struck the south tower. Shortly after, we were told not to accept ANY more airplanes into the New York area and departures were stopped as well.\n\nEventually, the only aircraft we had left was a New York City police helicopter circling near ground zero. About 10 a.m., something I will never forget happened when the controller working radar told me that the NYPD pilot said the south tower had just collapsed. We were all shocked to hear that. I was on break and watching TV in the unusually crowded break room when the north tower fell. The silence in that room was deafening.\n\nA couple of hours later, when there were no more airplanes flying and nothing left to do, the air traffic manager told most of us that we could leave early. Part of me didn’t want to go. Our country was under attack, and I just felt like there must be something we should be doing. Of course, we had already done it by grounding every aircraft into, out of, and within the United States. I went home to be with my family.\n\nBrian Fallon, retired member\n\nDawn broke as clear as I’d ever seen, the thick cobalt blue of the night being chased silently into the western horizon by the radiance of yellow growing on the east. A benevolent high-pressure system had settled onto the East Coast of the U.S., clearing skies while allowing wonderfully moderate temperatures to prevail. I was driving into work on my favorite road on Long Island, the Ocean Parkway, which traverses the barrier island along the south shore, and lets me pass through the world-famous Jones Beach area before the parkway turns northbound and towards the New York TRACON.\n\nI love mornings like this, not only because I can soak up the natural beauty of the seashore environment – an effective way to lift my spirits before having to face the crush of air traffic that a good VFR day like this will most certainly bring – but also because as I cross the drawbridge leading out of Jones Beach, I can look to my left and clearly see the proud twin spires of the World Trade Center, some 25 miles away, gleaming in the bright morning sunlight now spilling over the horizon. Little did I know that this would be the last time I would ever set eyes on those buildings.\n\nThe morning routine was well under way at work, with the scramble of commercial departures pouring out of the area airports and nosing their way towards the jet airways. The majority of the departure push was completed as I went out on break; the time was 8:45 a.m. I walked outside to drink in more of this beautiful morning, looking up to watch the heavy jet arrivals pass majestically overhead as they were being vectored to the final approach course at JFK International. It never ceases to amaze me as I watch these behemoths quietly glide by that my friends in this very building are guiding them in this most crucial phase of flight. If only we had windows…\n\nMy reverie was interrupted by the angry buzz of my cell phone. A call from home! It was my son. “Dad, what happened with the airplane?”\n\n“What airplane?” I said, thinking that he was probably in a last-minute scramble before school, having forgotten to finish his homework the night before.\n\n“The plane that hit the building.”\n\nThat got my attention. “What building?!”\n\n“The news is saying that an airplane just hit the World Trade tower.”\n\n“I’ll call you back!”\n\nI ran into a nearby office where I knew there was a radio, and quickly tuned it into one of the metro area’s 24-hour news stations. The early, chaotic on-the-scene reports were being shouted by reporters trying to talk over the scream of rescue vehicles pouring into the area. I quickly called my union facility representative, to ensure that he was aware of the breaking news. “I’m watching it on TV!” was his immediate reply. It dawned on me that he was out at a NATCA multiregional conference being held in New Orleans. Dozens of NATCAvists from all over the country were watching this unfold right before their eyes. And here I am, at the TRACON, learning about this from a phone call from my son! “I’m gonna go see if we were talking to this guy. I’ll call you back.” I slapped the flip-phone shut and ran up the stairs.\n\nIt’s always disconcerting, walking into the dimly lit Operations Room after having been out in the bright sunlight, and this was no different. As I rounded the corner at the end of a bank of scopes, I stood there for a moment, to let my eyes adjust. The silhouettes moving about took human form, and I moved over beside a friend of mine, who was standing behind the final approach controller for one of the ‘Big 3’ airports. He was staring at the multi-colored display with rapt attention. As quickly as my eyes adjusted, I realized that the tension in the room was electric.\n\n“Were we talking to him?” I asked gently, following his gaze at the swarm of targets before us, quickly reading the traffic flow as the controller at the position kept issuing instructions in crisp, professional staccato. He slowly turned his head towards me, his mouth agape.\n\nHis voice was thick with emotion. “It just happened again!”\n\nI felt like I had just been slapped. “What?!?”\n\nHis arm lifted straight from his body, almost as if a string was pulling it, until his finger was pointing right at the scope. “There. It just happened again.”\n\nI looked where he was pointing. The southern tip of the island of Manhattan.\n\nOur eyes locked. We both knew exactly what was going on. We were under attack by terrorists. There could be no other explanation. Suddenly, a single question bubbled to the forefront of my consciousness: What do I do now? I stood there for I don’t know how long, my mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water as a million and one options shot through my mind. Finally, I realized that there was only one thing that I could do. I went and grabbed my headset.\n\nThe events went liquid shortly thereafter. No one had to wait to be told to stop departures, but then in rapid succession the airspace cleansing began. Normally, at this time of the day, we’re getting into our early lunch rush. The scopes around the room become littered with targets; student pilots thick as fleas, turboprops zooming about like seagulls in a feeding frenzy, and jets of all stripes droning in and out of the area airports.\n\nNow, the screen was almost blank. The airspace of New York, arguably the busiest and most complex airspace on the planet, was all but empty. I don’t know how long it took, but it wasn’t very long. As the quiet descended on the room like a heavy blanket, the voice behind me said, “I’ve never seen anything like this.” It was my supervisor. He has over 35 years of ATC experience.\n\nThen another co-worker walked into the sector. He had been watching TV in the break room. He announced that the Pentagon had just been hit. I couldn’t believe my ears. The Pentagon?? That can’t happen. THIS can’t be happening! I turned to the controller working the position next to me. He’s a Vietnam veteran. His eyes were set.\n\n“So that’s it, then.” he said, his voice rock steady, his tone final. “We’re at war.” The wheels in my head did yet another spin, my own military training evaluating the possibilities. As the answer locked into place, I nodded my agreement. My throat was too tight to speak. I looked at my hands. They were shaking.\n\nI didn’t even see the footage of the events until a few hours later, when I finally got home. I watched the news for about five minutes, and then shut off the TV, after I felt the bile begin to rise in the back of my throat. It would be another day before I learned that Susan Mackay, the wife of Boston Center controller Doug Mackay, was on American Airlines Flight 11, the first one to hit the WTC. It would be a few more days before the body of another friend of mine, a New York City firefighter, would be pulled out of the rubble. But the feelings of grief and utter helplessness in the face of such unspeakable horror were already settling in.\n\nI tried to keep up a brave front for the kids, cooing that everything would be all right, that our guys would go out there and find the Bad Guys, and put them out of business. I wished I could’ve convinced myself, but one look at the gray glass of the TV told me that there was a whole world of horror and terror out there, and that at long last, it had washed upon these shores, crashing in like a tsunami. I held my kids close, and said a prayer, asking that they not get swept away too, like so many of my neighbor’s neighbors and friend’s friends had, so senselessly, just this very morning. I tried to keep the kids busy, got them going on their schoolwork, because “tomorrow was going to be just another normal day.” As I was helping my daughter, I noticed a little inspirational message at the top of one of the pages in her homework agenda. It read, “You may be but one person in all the world, but to one person, you may be the world.” That gave me some needed perspective. I stroked my daughter’s hair as I took a deep, calming breath.\n\nFor whatever divine reason, I realized I was where I needed to be, doing what I needed to be doing. In time, perhaps something in all this insanity would make sense. But for now, I knew what my job was – to keep on doing the things that I needed to be doing.\n\nThings were anything but normal for the next couple of days, as the resuscitation of the National Airspace System began. Chaotic and convoluted it was, but resuscitate it we did, anemic as it may have been. It took several days for all the NATCAvists down in New Orleans to find their way home. Most had to rent vehicles and drive home. The NATCA National Executive Board (NEB) had told the Communications Committee to shut down our WebBoards. NATCA, at that time, had both a public and a private Internet-based electronic Bulletin Board Service (BBS), which allows controllers from all over the country to post messages and discuss issues on a multitude of topics, where – along with our websites – the National Office can disseminate the latest news on issues affecting NATCA, aviation, and labor. Because of the criminal nature of the attacks, as well as the over-arching National Security concerns surrounding them, any discussion or speculation related to these events or the new procedures in place – which seemed to be changing daily –would receive no statutory protection and/or union privilege whatsoever. For our own protection, NATCA issued a gag order on itself.\n\nIt was only a couple of days after “The Events” that the Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) Team began to appear throughout the facilities touched by the tragedy. The CISM Team is a cooperative effort between the FAA and NATCA, where specially trained NATCA controllers come to a facility after a major accident or incident, to talk to not just the controllers involved with the event(s), but anyone in the facility – supervisors, support specialists, secretaries – who may be feeling stressed out by what happened, and to give them information on ways to help them cope, as well as contact information for more in-depth assistance, should it be needed. For major accidents, there will often be formal De-Breifings. Normally, only 1 or 2 CISM debriefers deploy to a facility, usually for just one day, and almost never more than three for even a major accident. The events of September 11th mobilized almost the entire CISM Team of 14 controllers for almost a month.\n\nWith our interactive forums closed, the only national communications we had was through our websites. We had just last year moved NATCA’s entire Internet presence onto a new system and revamped the entire look and feel of both the public and private sites. The main architect of this re-structuring was none other than my dear friend Bryan Thompson, who is also the Editor-In-Chief of The NATCA Voice, our national grassroots newsletter. Bryan, a controller at the Chicago TRACON, and a former U.S. Marine, was feeling especially frustrated by the terrorist attacks and the ensuing self-imposed NATCA gag order. Then the letters started pouring in. John Carr, president of NATCA, began forwarding e-mails and letters the National Office was receiving from controllers and ATC organizations from all over the globe.\n\nWhen the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta, gave the order to shut down the NAS, the response was immediate. Across the country, over 700 airplanes were brought down safely in four minutes; in less than two hours, over 5,000 flights that had been airborne were on the deck.\n\nThere was not a single incident outside of the four hijacked aircraft. Then we began receiving information about all the flights around the world that were diverted. Photos of Gander and Newfoundland in Canada, flooded with diverted aircraft, heavy jets packed onto runways like they were on an aircraft carrier. Stories of the citizens of these small communities opening their homes to the stranded passengers. The letters and e-mails from around the world continued to flow in, the world aviation community embracing us in sorrow and brotherhood.\n\nSlowly things began to get back to normal, or as we’re calling it, the ‘New Normal’. The private BBS came back on line, and a few weeks later, the public BBS was back up. We’re still cautious in what we say, but we’re talking about how we feel.\n\nWhile the terrorists had most certainly hit America with a near-crippling sucker punch to our collective Solar Plexus, what they didn’t realize at the time they planned their attacks was that by turning aircraft full of innocent civilians into weapons of mass destruction, they had attacked every nation on Earth. The world was now pulling together, not just militarily, but emotionally. We as Americans were hurt, and our friends around the globe reached out to help. And in the especially close fraternity of aviation, we unified in friendship, empathy, and understanding. As the sordid process of reclamation and rebuilding continues, we in the ATC community are faced with a whole new paradigm of safety and security. There are many more questions than answers of how to best implement many of the new challenges before us, but for air traffic controllers around the world, our mission remains unchanged. We are to grab our headsets, and safely keep the airplanes moving.\n\nSharon Keller, retired member\n\nI was an air traffic controller at the New York TRACON working traffic on 9/11. At first, some of us weren’t sure what size plane hit the World Trade Center (WTC). Only some were aware of a second plane, and when it turned around it almost hit a Newark (EWR) departure.\n\nAs soon as it hit, we closed down the New York airspace. I handled many of the aircraft that were being sent back to Boston Center (ZBW) and all of the pilots were asking what was happening at the WTC and that they had relatives that worked there.\n\nWe were all scared that we were under attack and didn’t know if we were in harm’s way. After all the planes were handled we closed all but a few scopes. I called my fiance who was an Emergency Service Unit cop at the Port Authority (who owned the WTC), worried that he had gone into work that day. He had not, but ended up going down to the pile for a few weeks looking for the 39 PA cops who died that day.\n\nThe next few days we worked the police helicopters and military aircraft. We also had to tell any pilot who took off to return to the airport or be shot down and advise their intentions (which I did have one). When the airspace finally opened, we weren’t allowed to let our aircraft go too high or the military planes would go after them. I had one aircraft do that; I was so scared he would be shot down. I was in shock for weeks. Every day after his 12-hour shifts, my husband came home smelling like a burning building, and I had to go into work every day also. Never Forget 😥\n\nDon Krivohlavy\n\nGoing to work that day was just a normal day. You wake up at 0 dark 30, and roll into work. On 9/11, I was actually with a trainee at the time. I trained him on one session in the morning. We took a break. We were training on the Liberty South positions.\n\nIt was shortly after 8:46 that we started training. There was rumor that a plane did hit the north tower. Nobody knew if it was an airline or a small plane. We plugged in and started working. Maybe 10 minutes later, we got a call from the center that there was a target out there and it was nordo. My supervisor at the time said he was probably a hijacking. You’re in work mode, so you hear it and your mind goes back to refresher training. You hear he’s a hijacking and now it’s, where is he going? When we saw him, he was at 24,000 feet, coming in from the west. He started descending. I unplugged and told the trainee to leave the room. There was no reason for a trainee to sit through this.\n\nIt was confirmed that it was a hijacking. I pointed him out to the Empire area. I issued traffic to one Delta jet and I said, “traffic descending rapidly out of 18,000. I don’t know what he’s doing.” They replied, “OK, we’ll keep an eye out for him.” He just kept going down. It doesn’t click then that something tragic is goinig to happen. You’re watching and going through your working day. As far as I knew, you’re trained to deal with situations and if it arises, you deal with it and keep working. A controller sitting to the right of me said, “that guy is going right for the city.” He hit the south tower. Eleven hundred feet doing 600 knots. I had a friend run in from the break room and say he saw it watching TV. I said I was watching it right here. But again, we still had other traffic.\n\nThere were probably 3-4 others watching it too. He went through my Empire airspace and the LaGuardia sector and he flew right up the Hudson and made a turn at the last second toward the tower. I had a couple pilots say they’d like to report smoke coming from lower Manhattan. I told them I knew about it and was contacting the proper authorities. It didn’t sink in until I got off position. I went to the break room and saw the TV news and that’s when it hits you a little bit more.\n\nUnfortunately, there was nothing you could do for that one aircraft. They had their mind set on what they were going to do. You watch him hit the tower, the tag disappears. You still have to worry about the planes in the sky.\n\nIt wasn’t until the next day that it sunk in. I was off Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, I went back to the spot where I go fishing, a place where I can watch the Kennedy final all day long. That was the eerie part of it for me. You could see the plumes of smoke from Manhattan and you didn’t see a plane around.\n\nIt was just a very eerie feeling. You can’t believe what you went through the day before. You’re trained to deal with a hijack or a medical emergency. But now you see the result of what had happened. It takes a while, to the next day, to have it sink in and then wow, you see the Manhattan skyline and realize it will never be the same.\n\nBy Friday of that week, I was on edge a little bit. When we’re working and a plane does not answer you right away, your mind goes to “oh my God, here it goes again.” You’re giving instructions and they’re not answering.\n\nA few years ago, I went to the 9/11 museum for the first time. I saw the reflecting pools and I got to see a couple of names of firefighters I knew. When you go to the museum itself, they did a beautiful job. The guide takes you around, you see the white roses and the tree that survived the collapse. It’s something I will never forget and you can’t believe it because you’ve been through it. For the few people I know who perished, it’s just horrible for those families. For anybody outside of New York, it’s going to a museum. But for people who went through that day up here, it’s a little piece of closure and how far we’ve come since that giant hole in the ground since the attacks.\n\nThe controllers that I work with – and this is not just my facility but across the country – are probably the highest level of professionalism you could ever think of. As far as the way we handled the shutdown of airspace and everybody landed safely without incident is just incredible.\n\nThe majority of the time, this was the best job I could ever ask for. To work with fellow brothers and sisters in air traffic control, you cannot replace that.\n\nPittsburgh ATCT (PIT)\n\nVivian Lumbard, retired member\n\nThe morning of September 11, 2001, I was in radar simulation training at Pittsburgh International Airport, having transferred to that facility from Boston Air Traffic Control Tower a year prior. I remember our traffic management person coming into the room saying they were trying to track down flights from Boston to Los Angeles and me replying, “The only carriers would be United, American, and maybe Delta. Don’t bother looking at the rest.” We discontinued training and headed to the radar room to see if they needed us to assist.\n\nDuring my career, I have been involved in many situations where controllers, including myself, were concerned about a flight emergency, a bomb threat directed at our facility or something similar and we all just continued doing our jobs. But this…this was something so much more. All of us were in the same place of shock and initial stages of grief, but had a job to do to keep as many people safe as possible. My most poignant air traffic control memory from that morning was in the radar room witnessing some of my colleagues working traffic with silent tears running down their faces, while their voices remained strong, calm and sure on frequency. What air traffic controllers nationwide accomplished that day had never even been considered as a possibility, yet we did it.\n\nWe were ordered to evacuate immediately when it became known that UAL93’s last projected flight path before it was lost on radar was that it was headed directly towards us. I evacuated out with everyone else, but had none of my personal belongings. Everyone was rushing to their vehicles and leaving. I jumped into a co-worker’s car and she asked, “Where do we go?” “Northwest,” I replied. “The plane is coming from the northwest; maybe we’ll be able to see and avoid it.” We went to her home and attempted to call into the facility for about an hour, only hearing a busy signal each time we called as we watched the news broadcasts in horror. The staff person who finally answered the call stated, “Everyone was supposed to meet at the basketball net.” I recall telling him that no one followed protocol because the airport’s fuel tanks were nearby and none of us wanted to be that close to an ignition source if the plane were to crash at the airport. We were told we had been released for the day, but I could come back to gather my personal belongings and vehicle. When my co-worker drove me back to the facility, our Tech Ops people had already changed all the security codes and were only allowing FAA personnel they recognized on the premises.\n\nThe following weeks were filled with daily airspace rule changes, watching those few general aviation aircraft that didn’t get the word being directed and escorted by military aircraft to land, new security protocols, and new procedures for coordination of all emergency events. In many publicly unseen ways, air traffic control changed that September 11th, but the one thing that didn’t change was the basic air traffic controller “can do” attitude; it only got stronger for those of us who were present that day.\n\nOn a different but related note, the captain of American 11, John Ogonowski, lived only several miles from where I had lived in Dracut, Massachusetts. For a long time after 9/11, I wondered how many times I may have spoken with him on frequency at BOS or passed him in our neighborhood supermarket, etc. never realizing that I would never forget his name in the future.\n\nVivian M. Lumbard\n\nRetired Air Traffic Controller (1991-2016, BOS, PIT, YNG)\n\nEric Stormfels, retired member\n\nAs we practice holding, I heard my co-worker mention something about New York Center not taking aircraft due to an airplane crashing into a building in the New York area. Wow, I thought. As time went on, minutes really, I wondered what had happened. Then my co-worker Charlie stated to an AVBASE flight, “They did it again!” I knew something was very wrong. I WILL NEVER FORGET!\n\nWayne and I talked. His words were mostly about political issues concerned with the who and why. Stop! I just noticed it was awful quiet on Pittsburgh Departure frequency. It was push time. There was nothing happening. Nothing at all! I WILL NEVER FORGET!\n\nA medical helicopter check on the frequency, no one answered him. I wondered. A Piper checked on the frequency, no one answered. I worried now. I had a conversation with both pilots and we all expressed our concern at the lack of ATC communication. What was going on? I WILL NEVER FORGET!\n\nI called Cleveland Center, but there was no answer. At this point I thought we were at war and everyone I worked with was dead. This was not the case, but I WILL NEVER FORGET!\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, I convinced Wayne we should land. It was really only a 10-word conversation, but it seemed like an hour. We turn toward BVI and tuned in the tower frequency. I felt relieved to hear a pattern full of airplanes and Jimmy on the frequency. I WILL NEVER FORGET!\n\nI asked him if he could get Pittsburgh Approach on the land line? He said, “we haven’t been able to raise them for a few minutes now.” I worried about my co-workers. I asked Jim if we were operating under certain security rules, he stated he didn’t know. I was scared!\n\nI WILL NEVER FORGET!\n\nSyracuse ATCT (SYR)\n\nCarmen Reale, retired member\n\nSeptember 11 happened to be my RDO. My next shift was the next day – Wednesday morning, the 9/12 shift.\n\nApproaching the gate, there was a local Syracuse police officer guarding it. I approached and he asked for my ID. Prior to 9/11, we never wore our IDs. Mine was in my locker. I had to have someone from inside come out and vouch for me to get inside and to come out with my ID to show him my credential.\n\nNeedless to say, an ID has been worn all the time since. A policeman was stationed at the gate for almost a year following 9/11.\n\nTeterboro ATCT (TEB)\n\nJerry and Elena Nash, retired members\n\nIn the Fall of 2001, Elena and I lived in the shadows of the World Trade Center on Staten Island. We worked west of the Hudson with one of the best views in the world. Our neighbors worked at the WTC. Our local first responders were stationed at our neighborhood FDNY and NYPD buildings.\n\nOn September 10th, we were returning from a visit to St. Louis. We, being airplane buffs, planned a trip to Wright Patterson Air Force Museum in Ohio. We’d allocated a few hours and were consumed by the displays. We nearly tripled our expected time to revel in the history of our profession. We decided that we wouldn’t be able to make the drive home to New York City. We decided to travel until we were hungry or tired and would stop for the night and complete our trip home the morning of September 11, 2001. We made it to just a few miles east of Shanksville, Pennsylvania for the evening.\n\nWe both worked the Hudson River VFR corridor from Teterboro ATCT. We knew the airspace and procedures well. When we awoke on the morning of 9/11 we witnessed, just as most of the world, the plane crash into our iconic NYC buildings. Knowing the airspace, we first thought that it was truly an accident by a private jet avoiding another aircraft and crashed into our WTC. Moments later, as the second plane hit Tower 2, those thoughts were distinguished and we knew the threat. Soon, we learned that after having our city attacked that there was an aircraft down in Shanksville. This became personal. We felt personally under attack and as a nation, we were correct.\n\nWe knew that we could not go home. We left Shanksville and headed westbound towards Pittsburgh, but Pittsburgh was being evacuated so we made a turn north through the Allegheny National Forest to Elena’s aunt’s home near Buffalo. When we were able to take back to the road to home we found the right lane of the interstate closed except to military caravans, ambulances, and law enforcement headed to NYC.\n\nAs we approached NYC on a drive we’d taken hundreds of times, we observed the smoldering sight and smell of a city burning. We arrived home to find that we had left a window open in our apartment. We soon discovered our home in a blanket of concrete dust from the WTC.\n\nSoon before the attack on 9/11, the Great Kills Landfill was closed in Staten Island. Again, now, lanes of the interstate were closed but for the hundreds of trucks transporting the WTC remains. This was a daily reminder to us of the gravity of the event.\n\nUpon returning to work we discovered that our skyline and lives had been indelibly marked. We worked for months to get the National Airspace System to return to its full capacity.\n\nThe incredible dedication and professionalism of the NYC/NJ NATCA air traffic controllers was a feat to be admired for all time and was a proud moment of our careers under most difficult times.\n\nWashington Center (ZDC)\n\nGregory L. Wojcik, retired member\n\nSeptember 11, 2001: I remember it vividly. The weather was beautiful in Northern Virginia and a little bit crisp on my drive in for a dayshift at Washington Center. I was a CPC transfer and training on the last of my D sides at the Linden Sector which is a departure sector for the metro Washington, D.C. area. URET wasn’t a thing yet so everything on the D side was still done manually complete with flight progress strips, red W’s, and lots of strip marking.\n\nIt was my Friday and I commuted weekly to Virginia.\n\nThere was a rather busy departure push at that time of the morning with traffic funneling out of Dulles, Washington National and Baltimore. My trainer was Rich Wallace and the radar controller was Carl Finkbeiner; both whom today, I consider good friends and not just because we’re all Pittsburgh Steelers fans.\n\nI remember the push ending and at that time, Rich and I took a break. It wasn’t quite 9 a.m. yet and as I stepped into the cafeteria, there was a crowd of about 15 people standing around watching the TV which had a news report on and smoke billowing from one of the Twin Towers. I couldn’t hear what was being said, so I stepped out to the “Crack Shack,” ZDC’s smoke shack. There was only one other person out there and I asked what was going on because the same scene was on the TV out there. That co-worker said that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. Like many, I figured it was just a rogue Cessna or other small aircraft that lost its way or whose pilot had a medical issue.\n\nAround that time, there was a blanket page on the P.A. system for all controller personnel to return to their areas immediately. Going back into the control room, there was a small crowd around the Operations Manager’s desk with one of the Ops managers saying, “We’re looking for American 77.” I was with Rich then and as we walked back to the area, he said that we had worked that aircraft.\n\nAs we plugged back in at the Linder Sector, he started searching through the deadwood and found the AAL77 strip and handed it to the supervisor. That supervisor took the strip to the watch desk and upon his return, declared that the other twin tower had been hit. Things got real then. Until that moment, having been a controller for 11 years, commercial flights just didn’t get hijacked. The “ample security” that was in place prevented it from happening so it just never happened. In fact, despite all of the annual refresher training on hijackings, it just never happened.\n\nThe control room became a bit more somber as the normal traffic continued. Eventually, the order to ground all aircraft came and my training was stopped at that time. I was reassigned to a different sector that I was certified on to assist that radar controller in getting all aircraft on the ground. I doubt that we even did a training sheet that day because Rich was reassigned to a sector too and we just kept working.\n\nThe sector that I was assisting was generally over Roanoke and Lynchburg, Va., and frequently had more VFR aircraft that some of the other sectors in our area. The radar controller, Tiffany Meadows, rerouted IFR flights to ROA and LYH and most aircraft were reasonable about it. Some questioned the order but complied, especially when they were told to land and go watch a television. She also made a blanket broadcast every 5 or 10 minutes announcing that all aircraft were ordered to land under a national emergency. There was one VFR aircraft who just couldn’t understand the order and wanted to continue his flight. In no uncertain terms, Tiffany made it plain and clear to this pilot that he was to land immediately, and he did.\n\nDuring this time, the supervisor came back from the watch desk and stated that an aircraft was down near Camp David. This was not accurate but it was a reference to UAL 93’s crash in Shanksville, Pa. There was another reference made to this flight which has been debated on being said, but I do know what was said and I heard the words.\n\nEventually, the airspace was clear except for military aircraft. We eventually went to a midnight configuration of one sector, but a high altitude sector had a data block on it where Flight 93 was last observed even though this was in Cleveland Center’s airspace. There were several military aircraft in that area as well, including one using the call sign Wojo; my nickname.\n\nNon-essential personnel were released on admin leave and since I was not a CPC, fell into that category. As I left, the main gate at ZDC had been barricaded with several Leesburg police vehicles and that gate was never used again. Upon my return to work after my weekend, the police cars were replaced with backhoes and eventually, Jersey barriers.\n\nNearly a year later, I visited the Shanksville area that had been turned into a makeshift memorial with a chain link fence and many mementos left there. Since then, I have visited all three of the memorials. I’m retired now but the memories of that day 20 years ago have not diminished.\n\nWashington Dulles ATCT (IAD)\n\nTerry Walsh, retired member\n\nOn September 11th, I was working at Dulles Tower. It was a combined tower and approach control in those days. I had been a controller for 20 years, 15 of them at Dulles. That day I was working a 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. shift. Upon reporting to work, I found I was assigned to the tower cab for the day. The weather forecast was for clear skies and north winds. It should be a great day in the tower.\n\nThe morning proceeded normally until shortly before 9 o’clock. I was on a break in the terminal and a co-worker walking by me asked if I had heard about a plane crashing into the World Trade Center. I returned to the tower and stepped into the break room just in time to see the second aircraft fly into the second tower.\n\nI reported back to the tower and was assigned to ground control. We were landing on the parallels 1R and 1L and departing Runway 30. The departures were getting backed up, but not because of volume. Washington Center had imposed large “miles in trail” restrictions, limiting the number of new flights entering the system, as we all tried to make sense of what was happening in New York.\n\nDuring this time a United flight in the departure queue contacted me.\n\n“Ground, we need to return to the gate.”\n\n“Yes sir, it’ll take me a moment to clear a route, do you need any assistance?”\n\n“No assistance needed but my company has serious concerns about the safety of this aircraft.”\n\nShortly after that exchange all departures were stopped.\n\nDuring this time frame we learned that one of our departures, American 77, was missing and suspected of being hijacked. Events are moving very quickly now. The system is being shut down. The two finals are packed with arrivals and will be for quite a while. Someone in the radar room notices a primary target, (no transponder), coming from the west. It is moving at a high rate of speed and is going to cross our final south of the airport.\n\nWe have no idea of this targets altitude or identification. The final and local controllers are calling the traffic but nobody is able to get a visual. It passes to the east and into Washington National’s airspace. They of course had been notified and are tracking the target as well. It turns south, away from Washington, but in just a few moments it is headed toward Washington in proximity to the National final.\n\nWe heard from National Tower a moment later. National is closed. The Pentagon has been hit. AA77 has been lost.\n\nThe controller professionalism was incredible. The information was processed but this was not the time to reflect. There were still airplanes to get on the ground.\n\nWhile all of this was going on a “hotline” with Washington Center and other concerned parties was audible through a speaker in the rear of the tower. The subject was the suspected whereabouts of UA93 and the military aircraft trying to intercept it. As we listened, we learned that UA93 had been lost as well. The rest of the shift was quiet with only the occasional military or law enforcement aircraft moving through the airspace. When I came down from the tower, sometime around noon, I found that some ev"
