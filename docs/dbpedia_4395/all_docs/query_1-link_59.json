        "text": "The First Black Radio Announcer (Part 2)\n\nWelcome to Part 2. Feel Free to review Part One if you need to. The answer seems black and white if you can forgive the idiom. The dates seem to be firm, but I'll get to the confusion in a second. Most historians name Jack L. Cooper as the first black American radio announcer. Cooper was called in one article \"The God-Father of Black Radio.\" It's well deserved. His program, \"The All Negro Hour \", debuted November 3, 1929 on WSBC-AM in Chicago. This late 1929 start is where the debate begins. There is no firm start date on Joe Bostic. It's just dated usually to after his college graduation and assumed to be in early 1930. It's close to Cooper, but probably about six months after.\n\nWSBC has the oldest call letters in all of Chicago. It's pretty sad that it's now relegated as a brokered ethnic station. This really could have been a heritage brand. W.S.B.C. stands for World Storage Battery Company. the station began broadcasting in 1925 from the hotel Crillion. It was founded by Joseph Silverstein. It began as an ethnic station with various slots playing Greek, Polish, Italian or other programming for first generation immigrant groups. Silverstein just wanted to sell batteries, race was irrelevant. It's why he hired Cooper. To a pure capitalist it was just another demographic. it sounds cynical now, but at the time it was a very liberal position. In 1930 racial discrimination was a civic duty.\n\nIn the 1930s it was located at 2400 W. Madison St. in Chicago with co-owned WGRB-AM and WCDB-AM. The All Negro Hour ran at 5:00 PM on Sunday nights. It ran once a week initially but expanded to a Weekday 2-hour program. The program aired until 1935. Over his career, Cooper also broadcast over WHFC-AM,WWAE-AM,WBEE-AM, and WAAF-AM all in Chicago.Cooper had previously done advertising and sales for the Chicago Defender newspaper, a daily that targeted African-American readership.\n\nIt's interesting to note that Cooper's first radio gig wasn't in Chicago. It's the Chicago gig that gets him the certified credit for first black radio announcer but he was on air before that. But that gig has a questionable date. Most sources cite a year between 1922 and 1925. but the station is always 640 WCAP-AM in Washington D.C. But that gig wasn't as successful as the Negro Hour. WCAP, like much of the nation at that time was segregated. He actually had to enter the station from a rear door.WCAP was a share-time with WRC-AM and was founded by the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company. It only existed from about 1923 to July 1926.Occam's razor trims off the early 1922 date.. but the rest are still possible. (I favor the 1924 date.)\n\nCooper certainly didn't go straight for radio. He was born in 1888 in Memphis, TN. He quit school in the 5th grade to support his family. Similar to Bostic, Cooper was big on sports. He boxed as a welterweight and played amateur baseball. He even spent some time in vaudeville as a song and dance man. It was that vaudeville material that got him on the air at WCAP doing comedy skits. It also was probably that experience that got him into the Chicago Defender initially as a theater critic.\n\nIn his mid sixties health problems led to a case of permanent blindness. He retired from radio in 1959. he died in January 1970 at the age of 81. In 1975, the Chicago Park District declared 4.3 acres of land in the West Pullman neighborhood as Cooper Park, named for the first black radio announcer: Jack L. Cooper.\n\nTranscription Mystery Disc #90\n\nIf this persons handwriting was more clear, tracking this one down would have been easier. It's very frustrating to find a disc that actually is labeled but that the label is nearly indecipherable. Only the date is clear 9-24-40, almost exactly 70 years ago. The rest is harder to read than doctors handwriting. Other than that it's relatively common in composition. It spins at 78 rpm with an outer edge start. The A and B sides appear to have been recorded on different dates with unrelated content.\n\nI can infer some things from context. It came from a stack of other Perma Disks from that era, many with similar handwriting, a few that are certainly the same. I think under \"speed\" it says Moon River. Several other discs were labeled \"Moon River.\" My first thought was that some person had been bootlegging various versions of the song Moon River. This was wrong. The song Moon River wasn't written until 1961. (It's by by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini) It turned out to be a very obscure radio program.\n\nMoon River was a late-night radio program on 700 WLW-AM in Cincinnati. Moon River ran until the WLW sign off at night. It had what would now be considered an odd mixture of soft, \"dreamy\" organ music and romantic poetry. It was sponsored by Southern Cross Spring Mattress Company. It's run was surprisingly long, it began in 1930 and continued into 1972. Actually station management tried to cancel the dinosaur in 1953 but it's loyal listenership rebelled and the show was reinstated. In 1995, WMKV on 89.3 revived it for a four-year encore with it's original narrator Bill Myers. You can download some programs at Archive.org HERE.\n\nThis disc has about 2 minutes of music and poetry from the original Moon River somewhere in it's second decade of broadcasting. But Moon River is still alive. In December of 2007 Ward Glen, a later Moon River announcer started a late night poetry and organ music program on Sonoma California radio station 91.3 KSVY with organist Everett Lehman. More here.\n\nThe First Black Radio Announcer (Part 1)\n\nThe first black radio station owner was Jesse B. Blayton Sr. in 1949. But he was not the first black man in the radio industry by any stretch. A lot of the obvious answers are wrong. While Vernon Winslow was on WMJR-AM, he was programming, never on the mic. He didn't announce until he was on air in New Orleans as Dr Daddy-O in 1950. The earliest all-black program I have ever found that was \"A Harlem Family\" which aired on on WMCA in 1935. But the earliest black radio announcer is usually credited to one of two credible contenders: Joe Bostic Sr. or Jack Cooper. You've probably never heard either name. But both of them were radio announcers before Jackie Robinson was a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. More here.\n\nBostic is mostly remembered for his sports broadcasting. In 1947, he became the first black person to be licensed as a ringside announcer. In 1972 he became the main ringside boxing announcer for Madison Square Garden. But before all that he did radio. He was born in March 21st, 1908 in Mt. Holly, New Jersey. His parents did right by him and sent him to college. He had to pay his own way so he boxed under an assumed name to make money. He had won letters in boxing at Atlantic City High School. After he graduated from Morgan State University, in Baltimore Maryland he stopped getting punched in the head and started DJ'ing a gospel program at WCBM-AM in Baltimore. He was the first black announcer at the station.\n\nHe wrote for a black newspaper the Baltimore Afro-American. After he married in 1930 he relocated his new family to New York so he could go to Columbia University grad school. On the side he began to announce baseball games for the negro league games. It was how he began to segue into his sports career. But The Encyclopedia of American gospel music calls him \"The Dean of Gospel Disk Jockeys.\" Where does that fit in? In 1937 he started hosting a program on WMCA-AM called Tales From Harlem. In 1939 he crossed the street to become host talent shows on WNCW-AM. (They became WLIB-AM in 1942.) In the book The Golden Age of Gospel, Horace Clarence Boyer got the WNCW call letters wrong, noting it as WCMW but he boldly described Bostic in the following words:\n\n\"...New York City's Joe Bostic could ensure a career by playing and commenting on certain recordings. While other DJ's ruled the South, Joe Bostic ruled New York City.\"\n\nHe stayed at WLIB until 1963 having started another gospel program the Gospel Train in 1959. But he was slowly spending more and more of his productive time promoting gospel music. He continued to work in radio and gospel promotion into the 1970s. He even became the first black man to book a show at Carnegie hall. That is a lot of firsts for one man. He died in 1988. More here. George L. Hiss wrote the definitive book on him: The Joe Bostic Story: First Black American Radio Announcer. But definitively George L. Hiss is wrong.\n\n...Continued in Part 2!\n\nInterdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee?\n\nI started writing this post in 2006. It's literally taken me that long to find enough information to write a short post on this mysterious and seemingly redundant Federal agency. It's the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee known by the unfortunate acronym IRAC. This is where you say \"Who?\" I'll quote from their own Functions and Responsibilities page:\n\n\"The basic function of the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) is to assist the Assistant Secretary in assigning frequencies to U.S. Government radio stations and in developing and executing policies, programs, procedures, and technical criteria pertaining to the allocation, management, and use of the spectrum. The IRAC consists of a main committee, 6 subcommittees, and several ad hoc working groups that consider various aspects of spectrum management policy. The IRAC consists of a representative appointed by each of the following member departments and agencies: Agriculture, Air Force, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Commerce, Energy, FAA, Homeland Security, Interior Dept, Justice Dept, NASA, National Science Foundation, Broadcasting Board of Governors, State Dept, Transportation Dept, Treasury Dept, The U.S. Postal Service and the Dept of Veterans Affairs.\"\n\nBut isn't that exactly what the FCC already does? Yes it is. So why do we need a set of groups and sub groups running in redundantly beside the FCC? Actually it's worse than that sometimes. IRAC isn't even subordinate to the FCC. In it's own words \" Liaison between the IRAC and the FCC is effected by a representative appointed by the Commission to server in that capacity.\" They have one guy who tells the FCC what they did. Those above mentioned subcommittees includes the following:\n\nThe Emergency Planning Subcommittee (EPS)\n\nThe Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS)\n\nThe Radio Conference Subcommittee (RCS)\n\nThe Space Systems Subcommittee (SPS)\n\nThe Spectrum Planning Subcommittee (SPS)\n\nThe Technical Subcommittee (TSC)\n\n*Under the FAS are a couple sub-subgroups including the Aeronautical Assignment Group (AAG) and he Military Assignment Group (MAG)\n\nSo what does all this mean? I'll give an example: KAFA-FM is authorized for operation at the Colorado Springs Air Force Academy. It is one of a handful of radio stations operated on military bases around the country. Such stations are not authorized by the FCC, but are authorized only by IRAC. they first began broadcasting in 1964 with permission from IRAC, but went silent in the 1980s. They returned to broadcasting in 1989 at 104.5 FM. In 1993 they changed frequency to 104.3 then in 2006 they changed again to 97.7 where they remain today. It operates at 20 watts presently but even earlier this year was in talks with IRAC seeking to increase power to 100 watts. More here and here. The man in charge of the station for over two decades now is Dave West. More here.\n\nI have no objection whatsoever to the existence of KAFA. But I don't even knwo how many other stations are out there like them. There is no list that I know of (and I have looked for one before.) that said, it's a nice little local station run by student volunteers like any college station or other non-com. It's eclectic local and robust. My problem is twofold:\n\n1. Their engineering info is private. All FCC data is on the web in a nice easy to use text format. With KAFA we don't have any info on the ERP, HAAT, or contour. My info is all hearsay. Now I' know they've been very cooperative with local stations, and engineers but that isn't the same standard the rest of us have to live up to.\n\n2. Such stations are only authorized on a non-interference basis. As in... if it causes interference they gotta move. That's not a great way to license, which is why KAFA keeps having to move. KSTY moved to 104.5 so they had to move. 104.3 is short spaced to that so that's not a great place to park either especially with KKFN on that frequency over in Longmont, CO. So as stations creep toward the Colorado Springs metro KAFA is unable to defend it's turf. With a real FCC license thy would. However with power comes responsibility. They'd have obligations for full time operation, among other things.\n\nThey would have been a shoe-in for a LP license in that first round. Instead, they persist in a void, as they always have. From afar it's hard to prove that they really exist. The continue on mysteriously like the Yeti or Chupacapbras, existing in their very strange legal gray area known best in a small neighborhood around the USAFA and to a few bureaucrats down at the offices of the NTIA.\n\nTranscription Mystery Disc #92\n\nThis actually came into my possession as a pair of 16-inch acetate recordings. I got then in Nevada which is about where the story ends as far as it's provenance. the artist, engineer, venue and region remain unknown. Not one of the four sides of the two discs has a complete label. The largest swatch (above) is the size of a postage stamp and bears the date 8-8-54. it's written three times indicating that the complete label had song titles which were dated individually by recording date. Also, the two discs bear large roman numerals I, II, V, and VI. These were sides 1,2 5, & 6 indicating that there was at one time at least one more disc in the set. Between the two discs there were 24 tracks of very good fidelity. I post two below:\n\n\"Joy Cometh in the Morning\"\n\n\"We Are Ever Building Temples\"\n\nIt's simple hymns mostly, a male and female duo, with piano accompaniment. I did spend some time Identifying the tracks. Many of the songs are covers of old southern gospel numbers, but some seem to be are unidentified originals. All cuts were recorded at least twice, but there were four takes of \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord.\" I also note that \"Till the Whole World Knows\" and \"Whispering Hope\" were both covered by Jim Reeves in the early 1950s. I suspect they were big fans.\n\nWhen I Kneel Down to Pray\n\nLiving for Jesus a Life That is True\n\nI Come To The Garden Alone\n\nTill the Whole World Knows\n\nAn Evening Prayer\n\nWhispering Hope\n\nTake My Hand, Precious Lord\n\nFace to Face with Christ My Savior\n\nLiving for Jesus a life that is true\n\nFace To Face\n\nNARNE to NARND\n\nIn the year 1946, John Hogan of 970 WCSH-AM, began a letter-writing campaign. He was sending letters to radio news writers, reporters and editors to propose a national association for radio news editors. Slowly it came together and their first meeting was scheduled for October 24th, 1946. Sixty five newsmen met at the Allerton Hotel in Cleveland, Ohio. It began as NARNE, The National Association of Radio News Editors. This was not a meeting of the first group radio newsmen, but it was the first national group. There was already a totally separate group called the Iowa association radio news editors. An article at the University of Iowa Library website list a historical review detailing the following from those first 72 hours of NARND:\n\n\"Committees were set up for Awards and Education. A Membership Committee was established to decide how to handle candidates for membership and a Board of Directors was appointed. The first Directors were John Hogan, John Murphy, Jack Shelley (WHO, Des Moines), Jack Krueger (WTMJ, Milwaukee), Tom Eaton (WTIC, Hartford), Bob Mahoney (KWKH, Shreveport), Les Ford (WGR, Buffalo), Soren Munkhof (WOW, Omaha), Ben Chatfield (WMAZ, Macon), Sig Mickelson (WCCO, Minneapolis), Milo Knutson (KFBI, Wichita), and Dave Kessler (WHAM, Rochester). Officers were John Hogan, President, Sig Mickelson, First Vice-President, Jack Shelley, Second Vice-President, John Murphy, Treasurer, and Edward Wallace (WTAM, Cleveland) Executive Secretary.\"\n\nThey met and conferenced for three days. In that time their Constitution Committee headed up by John Murphy of WCKY/Cincinnati. wrote their Constitution. John Hogan Chaired the charter convention, and as he was at the epicenter of things he naturally became the first president of what was now NARND. They selected a name for the organization and elected their first officers: 12 members for a Board of Directors, an Executive Secretary, and four officers. Hogan was re-elected president at their second convention, in Washington D.C. in November of 1947. He is the only man who ever served two consecutive terms as president.\n\nIn a 1947 issue of Billboard discusses a code of ethics being formulated by the \"newly formed\" association. they list by name the members of the board. It includes: Sereno Gammell of WTHT/ Hartford, Jack Kreuger of WTMJ/Milwaukee, Jack Knell WBT/Charlotte, Soren Munkof WOW/Omaha, and Fred Hinshaw WLBC/Muncie. The president ot NARNE at the time was still John HoganIn November of 1948 their the third annual convention was held in Saint Louis, MO. At that convention they elected their third President, Sig Mickelson, of WCCO/Minneapolis.\n\nIn all this meeting, greeting and convening they did actually have a philosophical purpose. radio News had really proved it's importance as a platform to convey information on par to the newspaper. It's very similar to the way the internet has become a primary conveyance for news now on par with television. NARND wanted essentially to promote it's members occupation. It seems self-serving, but truthfully the power was already there, all that was left were the semantics of recognition. Their interest in professionalism and ethics while laudable was in retrospect, secondary. But I'll quote from their 1946 convention statement anyway.\n\n\"...locally originated news should be gathered, written, and presented by station personnel trained in news writing and evaluation; that this news should be written and presented accurately and without bias, to inform as many as possible, and should remain within the bounds of good taste; that the autonomy of the news director and his news department in the radio station should be recognized; that the news director should be directly responsible only to his journalistic principles and ideals, and to the general manager of the station.\"\n\nIt comes back to that first change from NARNE to NARND.They felt there was a difference. The name under which the Cleveland convention gathered was the National Association of Radio News Editors; NARNE. But at that very conference they changed that last word to \"Directors.\" Long time member Jack Shelly explained it thusly \"The change was made because from its start the organization was dedicated to the belief that professional news departments should report directly to station management; that the role of the News Director is a key one; and for many years full voting rights were reserved to persons who directed news operations with their stations, in a deliberate attempt to emphasize the status of such persons.\"\n\nIn 1950, keeping in line with that thinking, they ran a successful campaign to get News Directors listed with other station executives in trade publications such as Broadcasting Yearbook. It was about recognition and also in a strange way, political clout. In their first year, then President Hogan told the FCC that a majority of NARND members thought that radio news should be allowed to editorialize. Even then the direction for news was clear, opinion presented as well as fact. At that first conference one of the panels was named \"Shall We Editorialize on the Air?, \"News Gathering and Coverage.\"\n\nWe've come full circle today with much editorializing and punditry presented as news, or instead of news. it's hard to remember but in 1949 we were still in the grips of the Fairness Doctrine. Editorializing was a delicate art. the FCC decision was brand stinking new after the 1949 FCC Report on Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees. (I wrote about that once before here.) What's more interesting is that before the FCC decision in 1949, NARND supports the FCC on editorializing, even opposing station owners. But after after the decision they the other way. But it was contentious. Billboard described that November 15th meeting in DC as \"acrimonious.\" They proposed a resolution to support non-partisan news coverage, essentially a position against editorializing. It was voted down. The war went on for decades.\n\nIn 1952 they changed their name to the Radio-Television News Directors Association the RTNDA now accepting both Television news directors and members from abroad, mostly Canada. They've kept that name for half a century, you can visit them here.\n\nStupid DJ Tricks: Part 11\n\nThis is the last installment in this round of Stupid DJ Tricks. I'll revisit the theme again some day in the future when I'm stocked up on stories and reloaded with bile. This final story is big on the stupid factor, but at least there were no fatalities. There were an estimated 1.8 million fires last year and they killed over 3,000 civilians and over 100 fire fighters, destroying 10 million dollars of property in the process. But only about 16% of these are vehicle fires. More stats here. Let's segue from there right to the MJ Morning Show.\n\nIt's staff includes host \"MJ\" aka Todd Schnitt and his sidekicks Froggy aka Michael Cusamano, Fester aka Tony Siciliano, Hurricane Stevens aka Andrew Eden, and Meredith. Oh, what colorful nicknames.. except Meredith. It is unclear which if any of them directly started the grease fire in that van. But a later settlement suggests that the ringleaders were host Todd Schnitt, Tony Siciliano and Programmer \"Tommy Chuck\" aka Thomas Charles Ray.\n\nThe stunt planned for the morning of Friday the18th of December 2009 on it's surface seemed simple. They intended in an act of super tailgating to deep fry a turkey inside a van parked in the parking lot of Clear Channels Tampa studios. But deep-frying a turkey is actually already somewhat dangerous. According to the National Fire Protection Association in 1999 there were 500 fires involving a deep-fat fryer. WFLZ staffers were supposed to lower the turkey through the open roof of a van into the deep fryer using a crane.. The turkey burned like flash paper as soon as it touched the fryer. Then the van became engulfed in flames. Staff were unable to put out the fire with fire extinguishers. Clear Channel to their credit broadcast the whole thing live from its studio parking lot at 4202 Gandy Blvd.\n\nTampa firefighters arrived shortly thereafter and spraying down the van with fire suppressant foam. One firefighter, Ken Licata was injured during the blaze and hospitalized. WFLZ had not bothered to get any fire permits before the stunt. At the time, Tampa fire spokesman Capt. Bill Wade was quoted as saying \"I am not happy...\"\n\nInitially Tampa Fire Authorities sought the trio on arson charges, but Clear Channel has a lot of lawyers. they and WFLZ later came to an agreement. Schnitt, Siciliano and Ray would have to complete 10 hours of community service to support burn victim, donate a total of $15,000 to charities that help fire victims and to complete a four-week public service campaign to raise awareness for related charities including five recorded PSAs on the MJ Show. More here.\n\nStupid DJ Tricks: Part 10\n\nIt's a rare day a DJ is such an imbecile that federal agents have to have a word with them. In this case, someone needed to tell Kidd Chris that Counterfeiting US currency is illegal. Apparently he really is that daft. I'll quote here from the Secret Service Web Page:\n\n\"Manufacturing counterfeit United States currency or altering genuine currency to increase its value is a violation of Title 18, Section 471 of the United States Code and is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 15 years, or both. \"\n\nOn April 8th The Kidd Chris Show broadcasting a program on 101.1 KUFO Portland instructing listeners how to bleach and counterfeit US Currency.the initial complaint indicated that during the program Kidd and/or his staff were actually bleaching currency not just teaching an instructional. This detail is critical, because as stupid as the rest of this is, that is the part that is a federal crime.\n\nBleaching currency is a federal offense, a violation of Title 18, Section 471 to be specific. The Secret Service arrived at KUFO at 9:00 AM Friday April 9th and the Kidd Chris show did not air that morning. The agents ordered Kidd Chris to stop bleaching the money immediately. Fans of the Kidd Chris show took to the KUFO facebook page asking why the show was off the air. Kidd responded personally “When the Secret Service is involved there is only so much we have control over.\"\n\nMilking the event for all the drama they could, KUFO updated the The Kidd Chris page of KUFO.com to a blank page that read “Content embargoed for on-going investigation.” Secret Service officials did later say that they would not be pressing charges against KUFO, Alpha Broadcasting or Kidd Chris.\n\nIronically it was KUFO who was embroiled in a pay-for-play scandal in 1999 when they accepted $5,00 in cash from Interscope records for 50 spins over 5 weeks for the Limp Bizkit single \"Counterfeit.\" (That exchange was actually legal because of a short promotional disclaimer that preceded each spin of the song.)\n\nStupid DJ Tricks: Part 9\n\nStupid DJ Tricks is a mix of two kinds of DJs: Idiots and Evil Idiots. This one falls into the latter category. Mere egomania is not enough to qualify. While I do have to account for the indigenous colossal egos within the broadcasting \"talent pool\" this one is still special. In this case that super villain-sized ego drove a DJ to err on the wrong side of a judge who was reconsidering a $36.7 million contempt sanction. Trying to stay on his good side would have probably been a better idea.\n\nSo to tell this story I must start in the middle. Judge Robert Gettlemen of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois had already found Kevin Trudeau in contempt of a previous court order for using deceptive practices to market a diet program. It had all started with Kevin Trudeau getting dragged into court.. again. He spends a lot of time there. He was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud over a pyramid scheme in the early 1990s, and actually served prison time. In 1998 he paid a $500,000 fine for making false and/or misleading claims in his infomercials. In 2004 he settled an FTC suit by agreeing to a ban on his infomercials and a $2 million settlement. With a rap sheet like that, I don't think it's a stretch to call him a white collar criminal. So of course he saw radio as the next logical forum for his antics.there's a relatively complete list at Wikipedia HERE.\n\nIn February of 2009, Trudeau launched a self-titled Internet radio talk show. He then sought and acquired syndication on a few small AM radio stations including 1340 WFEB-AM on Saturdays from 10am – 12pm and on 1400 WFPA-AM on Sundays from noon – 3pm. Both stations are in the distant rural suburbs of Huntsville Alabama. From this radio station he would parrot much of the same crapola he'd previously written in his books and in his infomercials.\n\nIn 2007 he published the book The Weight Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About. The FTC filed a contempt of court action against Trudeau for violating that pesky 2004 court order. On November 19, 2007, Trudeau was found in contempt of that very court order. On August 7, 2008, (9 months later) Judge Gettleman issued an order that fined Trudeau 5 million dollars and barred Trudeau from appearing in any infomercials for any product in which he has any interest, for three years. On November 4, 2008, Judge Gettleman amended the judgment to $37,616,161, An amount wholly offsetting the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials. More here.\n\nIn February of 2009, just weeks after launching his radio show Trudeau asked his listeners to essentially spam judge Gettlemen. Trudeau gave out the judge's email and asked his listeners to email words of support for Tudeau. Thousands of people complied overwhelming the judges email provider and thus disabling Gettlemen's Blackberry and PC. The judge called an emergency hearing, and promptly held Trudeau in criminal contempt.sadly on appeal Trudeau later overturned that criminal contempt charge. The indignant prick Trudeau followed the story on his own website of course. More here.\n\nStupid DJ Tricks: Part 8\n\nFirst of all it's important to note that as of 2006 the FCC had only fined one Spanish radio station for obscenity or indecency. Seems impossible right? I'll cite the June 2006 issue of Billboard on that fact.Without getting into the particulars, let it be known that they really really wanted to. The FCC has always been on shaky legal ground with fines for racy content. They have those vague local standards to contend with and the initial requirement of the incident generating a complaint. But it was common knowledge that certain programs, particularly a couple on SBS and Lieberman were downright filthy. But due to the nature of prurient slang in the Spanish language, the FCC had bupkis. Obscenity is lost in translation. As a result, when they get fined for other violations the FCC seems to swing the hammer down.\n\nWith a virtual get-out-of-jail-free-card you'd expect the station would be disciplined in more vulnerable areas. but no. These are DJs. Let me tell you the story of Tropical radio station 97.9 WSKQ, New York. The fine was for a prank call on the program \"El Vacilon De La Manana\" which I should note is syndicated on at least 6 stations. The name translates to \"The Joke of Tomorrow\" or \"The Party of Tomorrow.\" In 2007 they were fined $16,000 for airing a telephone conversation with a caller without giving advance notice to that caller.\n\nWhat made this more heinous They made a call to a \"Ms. Juliana\" and informed her that her husband had just died in a motorcycle accident deliberate to elicit a frantic emotional response.Thereafter, the Station employee informed her that the call was a \"joke.\" Now it's morally interesting to note that the husband initiated the prank, but legally irrelevant. I'll parse he particulars after quoting a highlight:\n\nWSKQ: Can I speak with Ms. Juliana please?\n\nMs. Juliana: Who is this?\n\nWSKQ: The Doctor Raymond Martinez, I’m just calling from [bleeped out] Hospital\n\nMs. Juliana: Aha? Yes Juliana\n\nWSKQ: Do you know anybody with the name Luis, Luis Miguel?\n\nMs. Juliana: Yes\n\nWSKQ: OK, this person had an accident in mid afternoon.\n\nMs. Juliana: OK\n\nWSKQ: on a motorcycle.\n\nMs. Juliana: How is he? How is he?\n\nWSKQ: He cannot move his hands, he can’t move his arms, he suffered because he was not wearing his helmet...\n\nIt goes on like that for another 15 minutes. What they actually violated is called the telephone broadcast rule Section 73.1206. “Before recording a telephone conversation for broadcast, or broadcasting such a conversation simultaneously with its occurrence, a licensee shall inform any party to the call of the licensee’s intention to broadcast the conversation...\" The husbands initiation is irrelevant. WSKQ blamed the call on Rubin Ithier, who provided the call under a contract. But much like the way Haliburton blamed Transocean, the FCC has long held licensees responsible for acts by independent contractors. In reality, blame should flow upward, not sink downward.

They crave attention and they don't discriminate much between what we call \"good attention\" and \"bad attention.\" It was Oscar Wilde who summed up the problem thusly \"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\" I caught the news over the weekend and I saw a DJ making an ass of himself.I realized that it was time for another installment of STUPID DJ TRICKS. I have such a backlog I'm going to devote a full week and begin with my inspiration: Sebastian “Sebas” Bagby.\n\nOn September 11th Bagby, a co-host of the \"Regular Guys\" morning show on 100.5 WNNX went down to the Dove World Outreach Center to burn a Koran. because of the recent TV news coverage of The Center's Pastor Terry Jones book burning threats, the site was ringed by local police. Bagby identified himself not as a radio host, but as a student from Georgia Tech. When asked by a reporter form the Gainesville Sun Newspaper if he was Sebas, he denied it. He commented that he was \"...prepared to have a solidarity burning.\" As things went bad he had to change his tune. More here.\n\nIt's important to note that WNNX is in Atlanta Georgia. The Dove World Outreach Center is in Gainesville Florida. 5805 NW 37th St Gainesville, FL 32653 to be specific. Gainesville is 350 miles away from WNNX. These people had no idea who he was, nor could they listen to his radio program. But they did know he was clearly kind of dim and wanted some attention. His media pandering was so grotesque he earned some scolding from random passersby.\n\nUltimately the climax of his plan failed when Gainesville Police Officer Ryan McCazzio took away his Koran and grill lighter. Around 6pm he began taking questions from the media while filming himself. To their credit the questions were mostly intelligent. When asked about the consequences Bagby was indifferent to threats against Americans. \"If there's violence perpetrated on others based on their religious beliefs, that's not our fault - it's theirs...\"\n\nHe was not arrested, and was permitted to leave the area on foot. Despite the way it played out, Sebas was still yapping the next day, but had changed his story a bit. Now he was portraying the stunt as a prank on the media. I'll allow him to stumble through his own half-assed defense in this video he posted only yesterday.\n\nWMAZ and Professor Fountain\n\nI first read about WMAZ because of a claim that they aired the first soap-box derby on the radio in 1937.I could not corroborate that tale, but the rest of the story was still interesting...\n\nWMAZ first appears in White's Radio log in their 7th revised edition published in 1925 at 100 watts, at 1150 kc. This station started out as 4XL an experimental radio station at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia in 1910. The United States. Dept. of Commerce lists it in a 1915 directory. They note it's wavelength as \"variable.\" I cant confirm the 1910 date from their own biography. but it is certain that station became WMAZ in 1922. It was supervised by Professor C.R. Fountain. The National University Extension Association published a list of college radio stations in 1925, they list C.R. Fountain. It's my only corroboration for his existence. Mercer University lists Josiah Crudup as helping build its original radio tower in 1923. Both were physics professors. Fountain is not mentioned at all on the Mercer University website, but Crudup wrote a paper that at least records his role in the founding of the station. It's early broadcasting schedule, even after 1922 was described as erratic.\n\n\"WMAZ first went on the air during the earlier part of June 1921 to broadcast the commencement exercises of Mercer University with a 10-watt set. The station was silent from then until the following October, when its power was increased to 50 watts, and programs were again sent out... and on June 7, 1922, once again the commencement exercises of the University were broadcast... The general routine work of the operation of the station was done by Ernest Hulsey and Josiah Crudup, under the direction of Dr. Fountain.\"\n\nBut the one-sheet but Crudup contains errors. It dates the 4XL license to February of 1923. That's a full 13 years later than the Dept of Commerce listed the calls. He does later cover the conversion of the station from college station to commercial station.\n\n\"During the summer and fall of 1926, WMAZ did not go on the air. During the fall of 1927, the Junior Chamber of Commerce of Macon took ownership of the property and moved the studio to a new location in the business district of Macon. The transmitter was left in the chapel building on the Mercer campus. Since that time, the station has been leased to a local broadcasting company and has continued to operate as WMAZ.\"\n\nWhoever Professor C.R. Fountain was, he was gone by 1927. The transmitter stayed on the Mercer campus until 1935. Still a daytimer in 1937, it became a CBS Radio affiliate.In the 1930s it went stereo and went to 10,00 watts. In 1947, they launched a TV service, WMAZ-TV on Channel 13 which simulcast much of it's programming on WMAZ-AM. They carried the Hayloft Jamboree in those days, hosted by gene \"Uncle Ned\" Stripling and his Combo. the simulcast put neds face in the living-room and his band on the car stereo. Ned had previously been on WSB. In the 1960s 50,000 watts and it launched The Georgia Radio Monitor Program. More here.\n\nIn 1996, the call letters were changed to WMWR (callsign to have stood for Macon-Warner Robins), but a year later, the station was sold as part of a group purchase by U.S. Broadcasting. At that time, the station changed to its current callsign (WMAC). In 2002, U.S. Broadcasting sold this station as part of a group purchase by Cumulus Media, and to this day maintains its News/Talk format. the WMAZ callsign after a long tenure in Chicago, are presently available.\n\nGoodnight I.R.E.N.E.\n\nBy now we've all ready about lazer turntables. They're very nifty but in costing tens of thousands of dollars they end up in the realm of flying cars, jet packs and other things we will never be able to own. This turntable, named IRENE is something entirely different.\n\nThe presentation of the name all in capitals indicates it's an acronym (or bacronym) Somtimes on the dot gov site it's even presented as I.R.E.N.E. It stands for Image, Reconstruct, Erase Noise, Etc. Following that theme, the test record the Library of Congress samples to display he fucntion of IRENE is a 1950s 78 \"Goodnight Irene\" performed by the Weavers. More here and here.\n\nThis turntable is barely a turntable. This turntable doesn't even turn, it doesn't spin the record. It doesn't even have a needle or anything I'd call a tone arm. Instead, it operates optically, not with a lazer but with a camera. It captures 2 dimensional images record grooves making a map of the entire groove surface. Software then uses that data to reconstruct the sound. When a fleck of lint might make a traditional record \"pop\" or a scratch cause it to skip, IRENE reads right over it and lets the software reconstruct the best possible sound. It can even play broken records. the best part is that since it doesn't touch the record, it does not contribute to further wear leaving the best possible master for future attempts at playback.\n\nIt's inventor, Peter Alyea, described it thus: \"It's like a photocopy machine for sound. It brings the possibility of automation much closer to reality for these kinds of materials.\" IRENE actually can transfer a disc faster than a traditional turntable. The process of extrapolating a three-dimensional image from the 2-D image has improved dramatically since IRENE began. they began first with cylinders but now can also process Dicta-belts, and 78s.

I had to file it a tad with a very small round file so it could accommodate a standard spindle.That and the general good condition of the disc lead me to believe that it was never played. the crooked label tells me that the packages were probably labeled by hand in the factory. A machine would have almost certainly centered them better.\n\nPhonozoic lists no dates for most Federal Perma Disk recordings. one type, not this one sadly is dated to 1948. Thankfully I have others of this exact type in my collection, and they were all dated to between 1940 and 1944. So I tend to favor a date earlier than the date Phonozoic gives. But the disc itself is unlabeled, and the contents therein do not reveal a date, it gives the day June 10th but not the year.\n\nThe disk itself played very well, and made for a good quality digitization. it spun at 78 rpm, and started at the outer edge. I edited together sides A and B into one track for your convenience. It opens with a few bars of a choral \"Here Comes the Bride\". The bride's name is given as Elaine Redlin which I take as a maiden name. Several brides maids and female relatives also give their names: Mildred Waters, Gertie, Hazel, Elaine, Mickey, Ruth Yancey, Ruth Hatten, Lenore and Elaine's Mother. In the background the girls giggle throughout the recorded greetings. These are a bit stiff like they might be reading from a script. On the B side is another longer choral tune, I assume the brides maids are doing the actual singing. I bought the disc near Milwaukee, WI and their accents give me every reason to think that it was recorded locally.\n\nThe Midnight Frolic\n\nIn the late 1920s, the Commercial Appeal newspaper ran WMC-AM. The Midnight Frolic was a late night jazz program on WMC in Memphis that was an all-request show that supposedly was broadcast from the actual roof of the Commercial appeal building.\n\n790 WMC-AM first began broadcasting on January 19, 1923. A review of a Bessie Smith program there dates the program to at least that year. It clearly describes the program as starting at 11:00 PM and airing from the rooftop of the Commercial Appeal Building. My latest confirmed reference to it's Midnight Folic is in 1925 but it probably dates to earlier. The Book Jack Teagarden: the Story of a Jazz Maverick refers to the show:\n\n\"The Peacocks broadcast frequently on The Midnight Frolic Show over WMC The Commercial Appeal radio station. The following item from The Appeal gives an indication of how dependent these bands were on listener requests. 'Tonight they will start their programme with a medley air. the entire list of numbers has not yet been selected... it is hoped that there will be enough requests made to carry on through the hour...\"\n\nThe band (The Youngberg-Marin Peacocks) played a couple numbers they planned on then apparently requests carried them through the rest of the live program. The Peacocks had 10 members and were able to play 25 different instruments among them... just not simultaneously. Bessie smith cplayed with a orchestra as well but the number of musicians is less than certain.\n\nIf you start to read about this, you'll find there was an unrelated program of the same name on KMCS-AM in Inglewood, CA, and one on WDAF-AM, and another on KFI-AM in Los Angeles.WHO-AM had a Barn Dance Frolic back in 1932. 1160 WJJD-AM in Chicago had both a Breakfast Frolic and a Suppertime Frolic program. But there's a reason for all that. During that ugly separate-but-equal era many shows were divided by race into two very separate evening programs. Today that's an indication that the earlier program is the family-friendly program. The notion came from cabaret and it's at least a hundred years old, and the trail of etymology loses me there.\n\nBut it stands to reason this is something that radio inherited from vaudeville. Commercial radio was born in the 1920s and it took it's ideas for entertainment directly from the stage. In Birmingham There was a theater called \"The Frolic Theater\" where Bessie Smith also performed. In New York City the New Amsterdam theatre was called The Frolic as well. I'll quote from Virtual 42nd street.\n\n\"When it was built, the New Amsterdam was the largest theatre in New York, and could seat 1800 people. It opened in November of 1903... In 1914, the rooftop theatre was renamed Danse de Follies and Ziegfeld added a dance floor on the rooftop. Later, in 1923, the rooftop would be renamed again, to the Frolic Theatre.\"\n\nNotice that program is also broadcast from the roof of the building. Each of these programs at WMC, KFI, WDAF, KMCS and others probably has a connection to local theaters, and local theatre troops."
