        "text": "History\n\nKRQQ began its life in 1971 as KXEW-FM, a Spanish station which also aired some bilingual programming especially in the evenings. It was purchased by Grabet, Inc. Radio Enterprises in 1977; the new owners made it a top 40 station, under the name of \"The New 94 KRQ\", and changed the call letters as KRQQ. The station was sold to Nationwide Communications in the 1980s.\n\nAccording to radio industry trade publication Radio & Records, during the late 1980s, KRQQ[1] was the highest-rated Top 40 station in the United States under their program director and KZZP alum himself Clarke Ingram, with a 23 percent share of the total audience.\n\nNationwide later sold its Tucson stations to Tucson Radio Partners, which in turn was absorbed by Prism Radio and then iHeartMedia in the 1990s. The radio station is currently one of the best rated Top 40 stations in Arizona."
