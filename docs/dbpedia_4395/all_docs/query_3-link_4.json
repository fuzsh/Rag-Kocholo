If you can't find a facility that guards it\n\n(many don't), and they can't tell you who does, by all means test it!\n\nJust make sure you clearly state that it is a test.\n\nExample: \"This is a test.

They are officially approved and the CAA Safety\n\nPromotion Group actively recommends pilots to use them. Obviously, only\n\nwhen there is not a genuine emergency in progress.\n\nIt helps both sides. The pilots get to become familiar with D&D procedures\n\nwhile the D&D controllers get to test their systems. If no-body uses them\n\nexcept in an emergency, how do you know when they stop working? Pilots\n\nflying across the English Channel, in particular, have been asked to use\n\nthe Training Fix, so that the extent of coverage of the autotriangulation\n\nsystem can be explored.\n\nThere is also a trend to move away from 121.50 for automatic transmitters.\n\nThe distress satellites do not pick that up, so you are more likely to be\n\nfound quickly using a 243MHz transmitter, although these tend to be more\n\nbulky.\n\nBTW what is 123.45 used for in the USA? It has no particular significance\n\nin the UK.\n\nColin Bignell\n\nI had always heard that 121.5 could be pinpointed by the NOAA polar orbiter\n\nsatellites, but it takes a lot longer (more sweeps to get the Doppler\n\neffect needed).

It takes two \"SARSAT hits\" to get a fix, and\n\nsometimes (depending on where the satellites are relative to the ELT) it can\n\ntake a while - as much as 48 hours - to get a fix. OTOH, sometimes a fix is\n\nobtainable in minutes. The 406 MHz ELTs are indeed coded as you mention;\n\nmany also transmit on 121.5 as the 406 MHz signal can't really be tracked\n\nby ground- or air-based SAR teams.\n\nBTW, I made a mistake in my previous posting - the 243 MHz frequency isn't\n\nmilitary-only in the US; civilian class A and B EPIRBs (ELTs for boats)\n\ntransmit on 243 as well as 121.5 and sometimes 406. Military ELTs (the only\n\nones I've dealt with) transmit on both 121.5 and 243 if they're functioning\n\nproperly; the only time I've encountered a 243-only ELT, it was due to a\n\nmalfunction (and mounted in the empennage of a US Navy C-9B.)\n\n\n\nIn article <01bca1d0$271e54e0$a283f2c2@default>, \"nightjar\" <nigh...@pavilion.co.uk> wrote:\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>Will Flor <wi...@will-flor.spamblock.com> wrote in article\n\n><5s7hak$fs3$2...@news.inc.net>...\n\n>\n\n>>\n\n>> Interesting - in the US the police would not have been the agency\n\n>contacted.\n\n>\n\n>If it had outside the harbour, the local Coastguard station would have been\n\n>notified and they would have co-ordinated a search by helicopter or by\n\n>lifeboat.

I've played the same trick with other\n\npilots where I've been the lagging ship.\n\n-Ron\n\nWill Flor wrote:\n\n>\n\n> Yes, it may - but that's not our problem.

It had some serious power\n\nsupply problems and was putting out all sorts of stuff including a big\n\nsplash at 121.5.
