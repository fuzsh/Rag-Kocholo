        "text": "(This story is inspired by Air Canada flight 797 and Saudia flight 163)\n\nEastern Airlines flight 628\n\n(An Eastern Air Lines Boeing 727-100 similar to the one involved)\n\nAccident Information\n\nDate: December 28th,1976\n\nSummary: In-Flight Fire of Unknown Origin worsened by Pilot Error\n\nSite: Jacksonville International Airport, Jacksonville, Florida, United States\n\nAircraft Information:\n\nOperator: Eastern Air Lines\n\nAircraft: Boeing 727-100 (-25)\n\nRegistration: N8161N\n\nOccupants: 55\n\nPassengers: 48\n\nCrew: 7\n\nFatalities: 27 (25 passengers, 2 flight attendants) (24 on site, 3 in hospital)\n\nSurvivors: 28 (23 passengers, 5 crewmembers) (31 initially)\n\nInjuries (Non Fatal): 25 (22 passengers, 3 crewmembers)\n\nOrigin Airport: Miami International Airport, Miami, United States\n\nDestination Airport: Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport, Atlanta, United States\n\nOn December 28th,1976, Eastern Air Lines 628 flying from Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, United States to Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The plane operating the flight is an 10 year old Boeing 727-100 that was built in July 1966 and registered as N8161N . The Aircraft was delivered in August 1966.\n\nFlight 628 took off at Miami at 7:40 PM (EST) and is scheduled to land at Atlanta at 9:15 PM (EST)\n\nThey're 3 Cockpit Crewmembers/ Flight Crew\n\nCaptain Harry Mickelson (Aged 43) (Born 11/2/1933)\n\nMickelson was hired by Eastern Air Lines in May 1964.\n\nPrior to flying with Eastern, Mickelson flew with the United States Air Force (USAF) from 1954-1964. He flew as a Flight Engineer on the Air Force One for Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy and on Cargo Aircraft\n\nMickelson is rated Captain on the Boeing 727, Convair CV-240 Family, McDonnell-Douglas DC-9 and Lockheed L-188 Electra. He is also rated First Officer on the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar and McDonnell-Douglas DC-8\n\nMickelson has 20,420 Hours of Flight Time (Including 1,110 in the 727)\n\nMickelson has been flying the 727 since 1968\n\nHis base airport is Atlanta (he lives in nearby Marietta)\n\nFirst Officer Bernard Wojcik (Aged 31) (Born 5/22/1945)\n\nWojcik was hired by Eastern Air Lines in January 1974\n\nHe flew with the United States Navy (USN) from 1967-1974. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy as the Class of 1967. While with the Navy, he served in the Vietnam War\n\nHe is rated First Officer on the Boeing 727 and McDonnell-Douglas DC-9\n\nWojcik has 11,788 Hours of Flight Time (Including 760 in the Boeing 727 but only 80 as an First Officer)\n\nWojcik has been flying the Boeing 727 since January 1974 (Around the same time he was hired by Eastern) He upgraded to First Officer on the 727 only two months prior.\n\nHis Base Airport is Miami (but lives in Clewiston, Florida)\n\nSecond Officer/ Flight Engineer Eugene Miller (Aged 48) (Born 7/25/1928)\n\nMiller was hired by Eastern Air Lines in February 1952\n\nMiller is rated Second Officer on the Boeing 727, McDonnell-Douglas DC-8, Lockheed L-1049 Constellation and L-1011 Tristar\n\nMiller has 18,456 Hours of Flight Time (Including 1,302 in the 727)\n\nMiller has been flying the Boeing 727 since 1964 (the same year the 727 was introduced to Eastern)\n\nHis base airport is Miami (however lives in Pensacola, Florida)\n\nThey're four flight attendants, They're by age:\n\n(Lead) Stewardess Ruth Appleton, 33 (Hired by Eastern in 1965)\n\nSteward John Gilbert, 31 (Hired by Eastern in 1968)\n\nStewardess Betty Smith, 26 (Hired by Eastern in 1973)\n\nStewardess Lois McGrew, 24 (Hired by Eastern in 1974)\n\nThey're 48 passengers, 46 of whom seated in Economy and two (a couple from Chattanooga, Tennessee) are seated in First Class. Among the passengers are four children. Most of the passengers are returning home after spending Christmas with their families in the Miami area\n\nThe Flights attendants are starting to serve Supper to the passengers. Captain Mickelson and First Officer Wojcik are already eating their food.\n\nSecond Officer Miller notices that three circuit breakers for the rear left lavatory have popped. He doesn't tell Captain Mickelson or First Officer Wojcik about the problem despite the flashing lights and warning sounds.\n\nAfter identifying the circuit breakers, Miller attempts to reset them, but strangely, the Circuit breakers don't reset. He decides to wait a few minutes before resetting them again. Toilets get blocked all the time and its nothing to declare an emergency about.\n\nMiller attempts to reset the circuit breakers a second time but again with no success.\n\nA Passenger seated in row 29 complains to stewardess Smith about an unnerving smell. Smith also notices the Left Lavatory door pouring out smoke.\n\nThe Cabin Crew moves all the passengers seated in rows 26-30 to the front of Economy.\n\nLead Stewardess Appleton attempts to take out the fire with no success due to not seeing any flames in the lavatory.\n\nAppleton enters the cockpit and gives Second Officer Miller his meal and notifies the flight crew about the problem\n\nCaptain Mickelson and Second Officer Miller don't believe the problem to be that serious due to it being small smoke and that they can probably continue to fly to Atlanta\n\nFirst Officer Wojcik decides to go to the cabin to look and determine if the problem is that serious.\n\nStewardess Smith gets a brief notice to the flight crew that the passengers were moved to the front and that she believes the smoke will ease up\n\nThe smoke appears to be dwindling in size. After the smoke cleared up, First Officer Wojcik decides to check the lavatory again with goggles and an Oxygen Mask on. He needs to take off his glasses to put the goggles on which clots his vision.\n\nIf the problem is only a faulty toilet motor, Flight 928 can still be able to fly to Atlanta. If it becomes worse, Captain Mickelson need to preform an emergency landing.\n\nAs Mickelson and Miller waits up for an update, Miller receives Master Warning Light and tells Mickelson. It seems like Electrical Systems of the aircraft are failing\n\nCaptain Mickelson notifies Miami Air Traffic Control about electrical problems and that they may be off in communication\n\nFirst Officer Wojcik attempts to enter the lavatory but finds the handle hot to touch\n\nWojcik returns to the cockpit and says \"Okay, This is actually getting scary, there's no way we're going to continue to Atlanta like this, we should land at the nearest airport\" Captain Mickelson notices fear in Wojcik's voice. So Mickelson declares an emergency. Just Then a warning light flashes, the plane had just lost most of its engine power. Air Traffic Control redirect to Jacksonville International Airport with Jacksonville only being 50.5 Kilometers (31.3 Miles) away for Flight 628. The flight descends to 3,000 feet\n\nThe crew decides to use the emergency battery power but many of the aircraft's systems are still not working. Without power, the Horizontal Stabilizer can become frozen and it'll be stuck at cruising position.\n\nThe Cockpit Crew considers it unsafe to deploy oxygen masks since Oxygen will feed to fire, so the flight attendants are instructed to give the passengers Wet cloths to breath in. Some passengers even took off their shirts when the flight attendants ran out of\n\ncloths for the passengers to use.\n\nStewardess McGrew goes to rear of the cabin to try to find the cause of the smoke but never returns to the front, its presumed she passed out from the smoke or heat with her body being undiscovered by her fellow cabin crewmembers.\n\nSmoke is now entering he cockpit\n\nAt 8:38, Flight 928 appears on Jacksonville radar and instructs Flight 928 to land on runway 32\n\nAt 8:44 PM, Flight 928 preforms an emergency landing at Jacksonville International Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, United States.\n\n(Blue= The distance/path Flight 928 took down the runway, Green=Resting stop of aircraft)\n\nThe Aircraft continues down Runway 32 for nearly a mile before coming to a come after pulling into a taxiway\n\nThe Cockpit Crew power the plane down causing the lights in the cabin to black out and the engines to die\n\nStewardess Appleton opens the front left door and she ,Stewardess Smith, Second Officer Miller and 21 passengers (including the two passengers seated in first class ) escape via that exit , 1 passenger escaped by opening the exit on the right wing. Steward Gilbert remains in the aircraft to try to rescue more passengers and possibly Stewardess McGrew. However, due to the mix of thick smoke and darkness, He is only able to help and lead three passengers out. First Officer Wojcik escaped via his cockpit escape window. Captain Mickelson attempts to escape via his respective escape window but falls unconscious and hangs over his window. First Officer Wojcik pulls him out. Captain Mickelson is the last Cockpit Crewmember to leave the burning aircraft and would eventually be the last surviving crewmember to escape.\n\nJust after Mickelson was pulled out Steward Gilbert is guiding three passengers (two female, 1 male) out of the aircraft, when they reach the exit, an Flashover (an explosion which when certain organic materials are heated they undergo thermal decomposition and release flammable gases) breaks Ignities after under 100 seconds after landing. All of whom substained burns from the explosion. If they were off by a few seconds, they would have instantly been killed by the blaze.\n\nUnfortunately, 23 passengers and Stewardess McGrew weren't able to get out of the burning aircraft in time and either fell unconcious or became incapacitated to smoke inhalation or were consumed by the flashover. Steward Gilbert and two passengers he lead out later died in hospital due to smoke inhalation and burns they received from the Flashover (Gilbert and a passenger died the next day while the latter passenger died three days after the accident). The sole survivng passenger Gilbert rescued, 32-year old Mónica Munoz of ,Florida lost her husband Charles (Aged 37) who was also guided out by the late steward.\n\nIn total, 27 (Steward Gilbert, Stewardess McGrew and 25 passengers) onboard were killed with the 28 remaining surviving.\n\n25 of the survivors were treated for either burns or smoke inhalation, 22 of the passengers and 3 Crewmembers (Stewardess Appleton, Stewardess Smith and Captain Mickelson). 8 of the hospitilaized were labled as \"Seriously injured\" while the remaining 17 were labled as \"Minorly injured\" . All those who received Minor Injuries were released the next day.\n\n(Seatmap of the passengers , Red=Fatalities, Yellow=Passengers who Initially survived but died of injuries, Green=Survivors)\n\n(Note: Original seats of passengers before moving)\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launch an investigation into the accident\n\nIt was discovered that the 727 involved suffered an explosive decompression only 14 months prior in October 1975, the left engine was blown off but was eventually was repaired with an replacement engine. The NTSB tried cutting through the wire to see what could have caused the fire with no success.\n\nThe NTSB is unable to determine what caused the fire but they do know what caused the Flashover . While the passengers and crew were escaping through the emergency exits, unlimited supply of oxygen from outside fed the fire with the intense heat causing the gases to ignite with the force of any explosion.\n\nThe Cabin Crew (Both Deceased and Living) were criticized for not successfully finding the cause of the fire\n\nCaptain Mickelson and Second Officer Miller were both criticized for not inquiring about the fire's intensity\n\nAll the Cockpit crewmembers were also criticized for not descending later then expected\n\nThe Airlines Pilot Association (APA) has a petition that defended the Flight Crew's action. But the NTSB Report still criticized Captain Mickelson's decision to not descend right away.\n\nThe Crewmembers of Flight 928 (Both living and deceased) were awarded by Eastern Air Lines for their bravery.\n\nFate of Crew:\n\nCaptain Mickelson flew with Eastern until 1989 when he quit flying with the Airline after learning about Frank Lorenzo's scheme with Eastern, he flew with Delta Airlines from 1989 until his retirement in 1993. He died on June 16th,2019 at age 85\n\nFirst Officer Wojcik continued to fly with Eastern until being furloughed in 1990, he flew with American Airlines from 1990 until retiring in 2005. He prefers not to talk about the events surrounding Flight 928 but calls it \"the most intense part of his career\"\n\nSecond Officer Miller remained flying with Eastern until his death in October 1980 in the crash of Eastern Air Lines flight 329 (which is my next post)\n\nStewardess Appleton remained flying with Eastern Air Lines until its bankruptcy in 1991, she worked with American Airlines until retiring in 1998 at age 55. She died of COVID-19 on May 24th,2020 at age 76 (Just two weeks short of her 77th birthday)\n\nStewardess Smith now suffers from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of the accident and had to quit her job as a Flight Attendant.\n\nSteward Gilbert and Stewardess McGrew are both posthumously awarded for their bravery and actions during the evacuation\n\nThere's an memorial outside Jacksonville International Airport dedicated to the 27 victims\n\nSee also:\n\nAir Canada Flight 797 (A In-Flight Fire accidnet where the pilots failed to respond faster resulting in more passenger deaths)\n\nValujet flight (A Dougulas DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades, coinincidently Flight 592's Flight route, Miami-Atlanta was the same flight route as 928)\n\nLoss of Control in Flight, Glaser-Dirks DG-100, N968BG, Fatal accident occurred occurred December 25th, 2018, in So Cal Nevada Interstate, Nevada, USA:\n\n(View of accident glider on day of the accident following tow-release, via eyewitness)\n\nLocation: So Cal Nevada Interstate, Nevada, USA\n\nDate & Time: 12/25/2018, 1426 PST\n\nRegistration: N968BG\n\nAircraft: Glaser-Dirks DG-100\n\nAircraft Damage: Destroyed\n\nDefining Event: Loss of Control in Flight\n\nInjuries: 1 Fatal\n\nFlight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal\n\nHISTORY OF FLIGHT:\n\nOn December 25th, 2018, at about 1425 pacific standard time, a Glaser-Dirks DG-100 glider, registration N968BG, struck a wind turbine and impacted terrain during an apparent forced landing attempt in the SoCal-NV Interstate, Nevada, USA. The private pilot was fatally injured and the glider was destroyed. The glider was operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and there was no flight plan filled for the local flight that departed the nearby airfield.\n\nAccording to the tow pilot, the purpose of the flight was to fly the glider around the airport for a local charity project. The pilot reported that the glider pilot did not report any problems before and after the tow release. The tow pilot observed the glider rocking left and right before starting a descending right turn. The glider did not recover from the descent and impacted a wind turbine located next to the abandoned airfield. There was no post crash fire.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness who observed the accident takeoff, he reported that everything looked normal up until a few seconds after the tow release, he observed the glider entering a flat descending right turn, the glider kept on descending and the speed increased along with the descent angle. The glider then went out of view but he heard two \"crushing\" impacts.\n\nAn on scene examination of the wreckage by the investigator in charge (IIC) revealed that the glider clipped a wind turbine with the right wing and impacted terrain nose first, the wreckage was heavily fragmented, examination of the flight controls could not be done on scene due to the extent of damage to the fuselage. The glider was recovered to the local airfield for further examination.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION:\n\nCertificate: Private\n\nAge: 71, Male\n\nAirplane Rating(s): Single-engine Land\n\nSeat Occupied: Single\n\nOther Aircraft Rating(s): Glider\n\nRestraint Used:\n\nInstrument Rating(s): Airplane\n\nSecond Pilot Present: No\n\nInstructor Rating(s): None\n\nToxicology Performed: Yes\n\nMedical Certification: Class 2 Without Waivers/Limitations\n\nLast FAA Medical Exam: 02/20/2018\n\nOccupational Pilot: No\n\nLast Flight Review or Equivalent: 02/20/2018\n\nFlight Time: 2534 hours (Total, all aircraft), 210.6 hours (Total, this make and model), 1500 hours (Pilot In Command, all aircraft)\n\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, and instrument. Additionally, The pilot was issued a second-class airman medical certificate on June 5, 2015, without limitations or waivers. The pilot records showed that he had accumulated 2,534 total flight hours, at least 210.6 hours were in the accident make and model glider.\n\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION:\n\nThe single pilot glider was an all-flying tailplane manufactured in Germany by DG Flugzeugbau, Gmbh, with anti-balance tabs along the entire trailing edges, and a two-piece canopy (movable and fixed parts), built of GFRP (glass-fibre reinforced plastic)/foam sandwich materials and resin impregnated rovings for high strength parts. The glider was incorporated with a retractable main landing gear. There were no maintenance logbooks obtained during the course of the investigation.\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION AND FLIGHT PLAN:\n\nThe nearest weather observation reported these conditions: winds from 280 degrees at 9 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky condition clear.\n\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION:\n\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the glider clipped a wind turbine with the right wing and impacted terrain nose first, the wreckage was heavily fragmented. The glider was orientated on a 190° magnetic heading, with the debris field coming to the rest in the initial impact crater. All flight control surfaces were accounted for at the accident site.\n\nExamination of the of the fuselage revealed that the cockpit and aft section were fragmented. The instrument panel was located within the debris field sustained impact damage and thus did not provide any reliable information. The empennage was broken away from the fuselage and impact damaged. The rudder was found in a right position. The pushrods for the elevator and rudder were impact damaged and, when moved, revealed continuity.\n\nFurther examination of the glider did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical failures or anomalies.\n\n(View of accident scene)\n\n(View of accident scene)\n\n(View of empennage)\n\n(Close up view of the rudder/elevator)\n\n(View of main wreckage, note the heavy fragmentation)\n\n​\n\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION:\n\nAn autopsy was preformed on the pilot, his cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.\n\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.\n\n- Analysis:\n\nThe private pilot departed on a local flight, about twelve seconds after the tow release, the glider was seen in a flat right descent until it impacted the ground. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical failures or anomalies, also, an autopsy of the pilot revealed was negative to carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.\n\nIt most likely that the pilot lost control of the glider immediately after the tow release, the exact reason for this could not be determined with certainty.\n\nThe Investigation determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows:\n\nThe pilot's failure to maintain control of the glider following the tow release.\n\n--- Post updated ---\n\nLoss of Visual Reference, Cessna O-1 Bird Dog (L-19), N154BG, Fatal accident occurred March 14th, 2019, in So Cal Nevada Interstate, Nevada, USA:\n\n(View of accident scene)\n\nLocation: So Cal Nevada Interstate, Nevada, USA\n\nDate & Time: 03/14/2019, 1502 PST\n\nRegistration: N154BG\n\nAircraft: Cessna O-1 Bird Dog\n\nAircraft Damage: Substantial\n\nDefining Event: Loss of Visual Reference\n\nInjuries: 2 Fatal\n\nFlight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal\n\n- HISTORY OF THE FLIGHT:\n\nOn March 14th, 2019, at around 1502 Pacific Standard Time, a Cessna O-1 Bird Dog, registration N154B, was substantially damaged when it impacted a pond about 30 seconds after takeoff from the So Cal Nevada Interstate Airport, Nevada, USA. The student pilot and his passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the student pilot under the provision of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a visual flight rules personal flight. Nighttime visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from the nearby Interstate Airport.\n\nAccording to the pilot's family, the pilot departed with his son to teach him about night time flying and maneuvering. The pilot was also planning to a low level flyby over the pilot's residence.\n\nAccording to a private rated pilot who knew the occupants and was at the airport the time, the airplane departed in a southern heading before conducting a left turn. The airplane then disappeared from his view.\n\nAfter not hearing from the pilot for two hours. The pilot's family decided to contact first responders. A huge aerial search was conduced and at approx 1800 PST, a police helicopter located what looked like a small white airplane in a pond. The local police arrived on the scene and confirmed that the wreckage belonged to the missing airplane. The IIC (Investigator In Charge) was in the area at the time and flew over the pond with his private airplane. A diving team recovered the deceased occupants early in the morning.\n\nAn on scene examination of the airplane by the IIC revealed that the airplane came to the rest on its left side, both wings were impact damaged and separated, multiple other parts (flaps/rudders/elevators) were located near the fuselage. The airplane was mostly intact and was impact damaged. The airplane was recovered in the morning to the local airfield for further examination.\n\nA review of the Federal Aviation Administration electronic airmen registry for the student pilot, revealed that he held a student pilot certificate. The limitation listed on the student pilot certificate states, \"carrying passengers is prohibited.\" 14 CFR Part 61.89 discusses the limitations for student pilots and states that a student pilot may not act as a pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying a passenger.\n\n(View of accident scene as seen by the IIC)​\n\n- Personal Information:\n\nCertificate: None\n\nAge: 54, Male\n\nAirplane Rating(s): None\n\nSeat Occupied: Single\n\nOther Aircraft Rating(s): None\n\nRestraint Used:\n\nInstrument Rating(s): None\n\nSecond Pilot Present: No\n\nInstructor Rating(s): None\n\nToxicology Performed: Yes\n\nMedical Certification:\n\nLast FAA Medical Exam:\n\nOccupational Pilot: No\n\nLast Flight Review or Equivalent:\n\nFlight Time: 105.1 hours (Total, all aircraft), 75 hours (Total, this make and model), 19 hours (Pilot In Command, all aircraft)\n\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a student pilot certificate. He did not hold a medical certificate and was not required to do so. A review of his logbook revealed that his flight training began in January 2017 and that he had accumulated 105.1 hours of total flight experience. The student's first flight in the accident airplane was on November 16, 2017. He had accumulated 75 flight hours in the accident airplane at the time of the accident, of which 29 hours were accumulated during solo flights. During the preceding 90 days, the student had logged 11 hours, all of which were in the accident airplane.\n\n- Aircraft and Owner/Operator Information:\n\nAircraft Make: Cessna\n\nRegistration: N154BG\n\nModel/Series: O-1 (L19) Bird Dog\n\nAircraft Category: Airplane\n\nAmateur Built: No\n\nOperator: On file\n\nOperating Certificate(s) Held: None\n\n- Aircraft Information:\n\nThe airplane was originally in 1957 and transported to Europe, and subsequently returned to the United States in mid 1990. The owner at the time of the accident acquired it 2017. The military designation of the airplane was L-19E, and the civilian designation was 305C.\n\n- METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION AND FLIGHT PLAN:\n\nThe nearest weather observation reported these conditions: winds from 210 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky condition clear and overcast clouds at 10,000 ft above ground level.\n\n- Wreckage and Impact Information:\n\nThe airplane impacted a body of water (pond) about 30 seconds after takeoff, the airplane came to the rest on its left side and was observed to have been impact damaged, both wings were impact separated, the fuselage remained intact. All flight control surfaces were accounted for at the accident site. The cockpit sustained substantial damage. The cockpit instrument panel was also damaged, the flight and performance instruments were successfully recovered. The attitude indicator and turn coordinator face were recovered. Flight control continuity was obtained from all flight control surfaces to the cockpit through breaks and fractures consistent with overload. The right wing and left wing were impact-separated and fractured but remained within the wreckage area. Aileron continuity was confirmed.\n\nThe empennage remained attached to the fuselage. The left and right rudder were impact separated. The horizontal stabilizer and elevator were impact damaged and separated. The elevator trim tab was impact-damaged and remained attached to the right elevator through cables.\n\nThe wooden propeller blades were impact-separated and fragmented.\n\nThe engine remained attached to the airplane. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact anomaly or malfunction.​\n\n(View of the airplane during recovery)\n\n​\n\n- Medical And Pathological Information:\n\nAn autopsy was preformed on the pilot, his cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.\n\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.\n\n- Additional Information:\n\nAccording to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3, Chapter 10:\n\nNight flying requires that pilots be aware of, and operate within, their abilities and limitations. Although careful planning of any flight is essential, night flying demands more attention to the details of preflight preparation and planning. Night flying is very different from day flying and demands more attention of the pilot. The most noticeable difference is the limited availability of outside visual references. Therefore, flight instruments should be used to a greater degree in controlling the airplane. Crossing large bodies of water at night in single-engine airplanes could be potentially hazardous, not only from the standpoint of landing (ditching) in the water, but also because with little or no lighting the horizon blends with the water, in which case, depth perception and orientation become difficult. During poor visibility conditions over water, the horizon will become obscure, and may result in a loss of orientation. Even on clear nights, the stars may be reflected on the water surface, which could appear as a continuous array of lights, thus making the horizon difficult to identify.\n\nAccording to Advisory Circular 60-4A, \"Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,\" tests conducted with qualified instrument pilots indicated that it can take as long as 35 seconds to establish full control by instruments after a loss of visual reference of the earth's surface. AC 60-4A further stated that surface references and the natural horizon may become obscured even though visibility may be above VFR minimums and that an inability to perceive the natural horizon or surface references is common during flights over water, at night, in sparsely populated areas, and in low-visibility conditions.\n\n- Analysis:\n\nThe student pilot departed with his 17-year-old son to give him lessons about night time flying. Only one person witnessed the airplane take off and nothing out of the ordinary was described. The airplane took off in a southern heading before conducting a left turn, this would have forced the pilot to fly over a body of water. There were no eyewitnesses to the accident but based on wreckage examination it is most likely that the airplane entered a slow left descent until it impacted the water pond.\n\nThe dark night conditions combined with a flyover water with no cockpit lights/ground light references would have increased the difficulty associated with the tasks of maintaining aircraft attitude control and maintaining awareness of the airplane's height above the water while maneuvering in the initial climb. It is likely that the pilot either lost control due to spatial disorientation or inadvertently descended into the water; however, without track information from the final moments of the flight, there is insufficient information from which to determine which scenario was more likely involved in the accident.\n\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.\n\n- Probable Cause:​\n\nThe student pilot's loss of control following a flight in dark night visual meteorological conditions, which resulted in an impact with water due to a loss of visual reference.\n\n​\n\nLoss of Lift, North American B-25 Mitchell, N5960NG, privately owned and operated, Fatal accident occurred June 27th, 1986, in Roane County, Tennessee, USA:\n\n(Overview of the accident scene, direction of travel)\n\nLocation: Roane County, Tennessee, USA\n\nDate & Time: 06/27/1986, 2221 CDT\n\nRegistration: N5960NG\n\nAircraft: North American B-25 Mitchell\n\nAircraft Damage: Destroyed\n\nDefining Event: Loss of Lift\n\nInjuries: 9 Fatal\n\nFlight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal\n\n- Analysis:\n\nThe private rated pilot and the eight passengers departed the vintage aircraft on an instrument flight rules cross-country flight. Weather conditions around the time of the accident showed a high possibility of airframe icing and low clouds. The departure airport was not equipped with de-icing items and the plane was left on the runway for nearly 30 minutes. The pilot advised the airplane owner, who was a WW2 aircraft fan, that takeoff will be difficult with the current weather. The owner did not show any signs of concern and told the pilot to \"try his best\" during the flight.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that the takeoff appeared to be normal, the airplane used the entire runway before briefly lifting off. A commercial pilot who witnessed the departure stated that the airplane did gain enough altitude to clear the rising hills ahead of the airport runway. The airplane was seen in a brief descent before an impact sound was heard along with a post crash fire appearing in the distance.\n\nThe airplane impacted a rising hill in altitude level at a heading 46°\n\nwith the nose first at an airspeed of approx 171 mph. The wreckage was spread over a large area and a brief post crash fire ensued. There were no survivors.\n\nFirst responders discovered pieces of ice at the accident site that displayed a curvature consistent with the leading edge of a wing or horizontal stabilizer. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. A study showed that the airplane was close to the maximum gross weight, which would have effected the climbing abilities of the airplane.\n\nA study of the pilot's records showed that he was trained in a twin engine Piper aircraft in 1984, however, he had only accumulated a total of 45.6 hours as a first officer in the accident aircraft's make and model. The owner of the airplane was not aware of that. He hired the pilot from a world war two aircraft museum without requiring information about the pilot skills/hours.\n\nBased on the available evidence. It is most likely that the pilot, who was briefed about the weather conditions, decided to depart on an IMC flight with known airframe icing, near maximum gross weight, low visibility, in an airplane he was inexperienced with. The investigation revealed that the initial climb out from the airport is impossible with all these factors combined.\n\n- Probable Cause:\n\nThe pilot's improper preflight planning, and his decision to depart and continue his flight into known adverse weather conditions with known airframe icing, which resulted in the airplane's inability to climb and subsequent impact with terrain. Contributing to the accident was (1) the foggy conditions (2) near maximum gross weight and (3) the pilot's lack of experience with the accident aircraft make and model.\n\n- General Information:\n\nOn June 27th, 1986, at about 2221 central daylight time, a North American B-25 Mitchell, N5960NG, was destroyed when it impacted a hill near the departure runway of a local airport in Roane County, Tennessee, USA. The certified private pilot and the eight passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was privately owned and operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed from Roane County Airport, Tennessee, and was en route to a private airfield in Texas.\n\nAccording to preliminary information provided to the IIC, the airplane was owned and operated by a Texan business man, who was a WW2 aircraft enthusiast. The owner hired a private pilot from a local vintage aircraft museum to conduct the flight. The pilot showed little concerns about the fog and icy conditions that prevailed before takeoff, so did the owner.\n\nThe airplane was parked in an airport hangar one hour before the accident. The pilot taxied the airplane to the departure runway at 2145 CDT, 36m before the accident. The airplane was parked on the runway for at least 35 minutes (figure 1). The time from takeoff to the impact was less than a minute.\n\n(Figure 1, showing owner's limo and accident airplane)​\n\nAlong with the pilot and aircraft owner, there were four friends of the owner, his son and daughter, and one distant relative.\n\nAn eyewitness reported that the airplane struggled to attain any height after lifting off the runway. The airplane stayed on level heading before impacting a hill. A post crash fire ensued (figure 2).\n\n(Figure 2)\n\n​\n\n- Personal Information:\n\nCertificate: Private\n\nAge: 37, Male\n\nAirplane Rating(s): Multi-engine Land; Single-engine Land\n\nSeat Occupied: Left\n\nOther Aircraft Rating(s): None\n\nRestraint Used:\n\nInstrument Rating(s): Airplane\n\nSecond Pilot Present: No\n\nToxicology Performed: Yes\n\nMedical Certification: Class 1 With Waivers/Limitations\n\nLast FAA Medical Exam: 09/15/1985\n\nOccupational Pilot: No\n\nLast Flight Review or Equivalent:\n\nFlight Time: (Estimated) 610 hours (Total, all aircraft), 45.6 hours (Total, this make and model)\n\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single- and multiengine land and instrument airplane.\n\nHis most recent FAA medical examination was conducted on September 15, 1985, following which he was issued a first-class medical certificate with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses.\n\nThe pilot had a total of 45.6 hours as a first officer in the accident aircraft make and model.\n\n- Aircraft and Owner/Operator Information:\n\nAircraft Make: North American\n\nRegistration: N5960NG\n\nModel/Series: B25\n\nAircraft Category: Airplane\n\nAmateur Built: No\n\nOperator:\n\nOperating Certificate(s) Held: None\n\nOperator Designator Code:\n\nThe airplane was not equipped with flight recorders and it was required to do so.\n\n- Wreckage and Impact Information:\n\nThe airplane's wreckage came to the rest in an area of hills less than a 1 km from the departure the runway. The first point of impact was identified with fragments from the cockpit and nose section area, the tail section was the first main section of the aircraft found in the wreckage path. The tail remained intact, but the ailerons/elevators/rudders were impact damage and separated, they were located within the wreckage path. The pushrods for the elevator and rudder were impact damaged and, when moved, revealed continuity.\n\nThe next main section of the aircraft was both wings which were impact damaged and separated from the main fuselage. Both engines were impact damaged and crushed and separated from their attachment areas. The flaps were still in the takeoff position (40d each). Examination of the propellers revealed that they were damaged and showed continuity.\n\nThe next major section was the fuselage (mid section) which was separated from the reminder of the airplane. The left engine was located near the fuselage, it displayed aft crushing damage.\n\nThe cockpit section came to the rest on its left side (captain side) and was impact damaged. The cockpit instrument panel was also damaged, the flight and performance instruments were successfully recovered. The attitude indicator and turn coordinator face were recovered. Flight control continuity was obtained from all flight control surfaces to the cockpit through breaks and fractures consistent with overload.\n\nThe last parts of the airplane found in wreckage path were the right engine and nose section. The engine displayed damage identical to the other one. The nose gear was the last part of the airplane found in the wreckage path.\n\n- Medical And Pathological Information:\n\nAn autopsy was preformed on the pilot, his cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.\n\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.\n\n- More photos:\n\nAircraft Structural Failure, Messerschmitt Me 262, N943BN, Accident occurred December 15, 2019, in Los Injurus, USA:\n\n(View of the airplane after the inflight structure failure)​\n\nLocation: Los Injurus, USA\n\nDate & Time: 12/15/2019, 411 PDT\n\nRegistration: N943BN\n\nAircraft: Messerschmitt Me 262\n\nAircraft Damage: Destroyed\n\nDefining Event: Aircraft Structural Failure\n\nInjuries: 1 (none)\n\nFlight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Test\n\n- Analysis:\n\nThe commercial rated pilot departed in the vintage WW2 fighter for a local test flight, the pilot reported that everything seemed OK during the takeoff and subsequent climb out, the weather was calm and there were a few clouds present. The pilot reported that about one minute and six seconds from the initial takeoff, he heard a cranking like noise coming from his left side, the pilot then reported seeing the left wing suddenly separate from the airframe. The airplane was not equipped with an ejection seat, but the pilot managed to open the canopy and jump from the airplane and use his parachute. The pilot managed to land close to the shore and he was subsequently rescued by a small fishing boat.\n\nA two-seater training airplane was flying about 3000 feet above the vintage jet, it was equipped by a student pilot and a flight instructor, the flight instructor reported that as he was observing the jet cruise in the air, the left wing completely separated from the airframe. The flight instructor added that he did not see any planes or birds/drones near or in the jet's flightpath. The instructor captured a photo showing the jet in an out of control spiral towards the sea, the photo was taken after the pilot jumped and activated his parachute. The photo shows the left wing in the far distance with fire presumably visible from the left engine area.\n\nThe airplane impacted the waters and was completely destroyed. Two small fishing boats saw the aircraft impact the water and went to the area to see if they can retrieve any wreckage. The boats managed to recover some small parts of the tail section and right engine. Nothing else was recovered and subsequent dive searches located fragmented wreckage resting on the bottom of the sea floor. A few additional parts of the cockpit were recovered, the left wing and engine were not located during the searches.\n\nThe aircraft was built in mid 1944, records show that the aircraft was offered for sale in the US in the late 1950s, and that it has been on operation with several vintage flight museums ever since. Maintenance records indicated that the most recent annual inspection was completed on May 06, 2018, at an airframe total time of 13,472.3 hours. According to the entry, the engine had accumulated 451 hours since its most recent overhaul.\n\nDue to the lack of recovered wreckage, the investigators were unable to examine the airplane's left wing or engine. Testing done on the recovered parts revealed that there were no anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunctions. Additionally, a study of the photos and eyewitness accounts revealed the absence of any birds/drones/airplanes in the airplane's flightpath or surrounding area.\n\nIt is most likely that the left wing suffered an inflight structure failure of undetermined origin, which resulted in the loss of control.\n\n- Probable Cause:\n\nAn inflight structural failure of the left wing for reasons that could not be determined due to the lack of recovered wreckage.\n\n- History of The Flight:\n\nOn December 15th, 2019, at around 411 Pacific Standard Time, a Messerschmitt Me 262 vintage jet, N943BN, was destroyed after an in-flight breakup and a subsequent impact with the water shortly after takeoff from Los Injurus International Airport, Los Injurus, USA. The commercial rated pilot was not injured. The airplane was owned by the pilot and operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 test flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the local test flight.\n\nAccording to the pilot, the airplane's left wing separated about one minute after takeoff and the airplane entered a spiraling descent afterwards, the pilot opened the canopy, jumped, and activated his parachute, he was rescued by a nearby fishing boat. The airplane impacted the waters of the sea and was submerged, a few parts were located during the immediate recovery efforts, these parts were recovered and sent to a secure location for further examination.\n\nThe Messerschmitt Me 262 was a single seat jet-powered fighter aircraft manufactured by Messerschmitt AG in the early 1940s, about 1,430 of these fighter jets were built. The accident airplane was powered by two Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet engines (figure 1).\n\n(Figure 1: accident airplane)\n\n​\n\nI originally decided to leave this forum for good but this story i made has been in my mind for a while now and i just wanted to post this.\n\nJapan Air Lines flight 76\n\n(A Japan Air Lines Boeing 747-100 similar to the one involved0\n\nAccident Information:\n\nDate: July 2nd, 1971\n\nSummary Runway Excursion due to Pilot Error during go-around\n\nSite: Honolulu International Airport, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States\n\nFatalities: 34 (28 plane, 6 ground)\n\nSurvivors: 229 (Plane)\n\nInjuries (Non Fatal): 159 (145 plane, 14 ground)\n\nAircraft/Flight Information:\n\nOperator: Japan Air Lines\n\nAircraft: Boeing 747-146 (-100)\n\nRegistration: JA8100\n\nOccupants: 257\n\nPassengers: 236\n\nCrew: 21\n\nFatalities: 28 (25 passengers, 3 flight attendants)\n\nSurvivors: 229 (211 Passengers, 18 crew)\n\nInjuries (Non Fatal): 145 (129 passengers, 16 crew) (43 serious, 102 Minor)\n\nOrigin Airport: Tokyo International Airport, Tokyo, Japan (Now Tokyo- Haneda International Airport)\n\nDestination: Honolulu International Airport, Honolulu, United States (Now Daniel K.
