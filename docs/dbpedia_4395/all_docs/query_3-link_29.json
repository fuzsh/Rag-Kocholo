After I left military service, I returned to Livny where I was prosecuted for an attempted\n\nrape, after which I was convicted and served my sentence at the Naryshkinskaya Penal Colony in the Uritskiy\n\nDistrict of the Orlov Region (Federal Public Institution, Penal Colony No. 5, Deputy Head of Department’s\n\nnote) until 1992. After I was released, I had various jobs, in particular, I worked as a turner at the Livenskiy\n\nCounting and Computer Graphics Plant, an individual entrepreneur, and Head of the Raw Material Site of the\n\nLivenskiy Concrete Product Plant, after which I was a master at the Self-Financing Road Construction Site.\n\nOver the last 14 years, I have worked as a driver at the Branch of “Gazprom gazoraspredelenie Orel” JSC in\n\nLivny of the Orlov Region. I do not work anywhere else.\n\nI have no relatives in the territory of Ukraine and other countries. I have never been involved in\n\nhostilities in the southeast of Ukraine and I have never been there. I have never been abroad and in\n\nneighbouring states, including Ukraine and Belarus. I know about the developments in the southeast of Ukraine\n\nand hostilities in the territory of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics only from the\n\nmass media, news releases on television, and various political talk shows. I personally do not support hostilities\n\nand think that people both in Ukraine and other countries should live in peace and reach an agreement by\n\npeaceful means. I have no relatives or acquaintances who are involved in hostilities in the territory of the selfproclaimed\n\nDonetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.\n\nI am not acquainted with Dmitry Dmitrievich Yakob, Svyatoslav Valeryevich Zhirenko, Alexey\n\nNikolaevich Andrienko, and Andrey Valeryevich Tikhonov, this is the first time that I have heard their names,\n\nand I do not know who these people are.\n\nI know nothing about any preparations to murder Anton Yuryevich Gerashchenko, a people’s deputy\n\nof the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and about persons engaged in these preparations; to be honest, I do not\n\neven how who the above person is.\n\nWitness /Signed/\n\n(signature)\n\nThe following statements were made prior to, during or upon completion of the witness interrogation\n\nby the following participants:\n\nthe witness E.I.

Full name Irina Alekseevna Dobrodeeva\n\n2. Date of birth […]\n\n3. Place of birth […]\n\n4. Place of residence and (or) registration […]\n\n[…]\n\nPage 2\n\nI would like to say the following in relation to the substance of the criminal case: the\n\nabove address is my address of registration, but I reside at a different address that I do not wish to\n\ndisclose. I am not registered with a narcologist or a psychiatrist, I have no head injuries and am able\n\nto answer the investigator’s questions. I have been married to Eduard Viktorovich Dobrodeev [date\n\nof birth …] since 11.05.2013 but we have not lived together nor kept in touch since September 2017,\n\nI cannot give the exact date as I do not remember it. /Signed/\n\nQuestion by the investigator: how would you describe Eduard Viktorovich Dobrodeev [date\n\nof birth …], what do you know of his places of study or work in the past 10 years? Also, what do you\n\nknow of him doing service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, being held liable in\n\ncriminal or administrative proceedings or of E.V. Dobrodeev’s registration with specialist doctors?\n\nAnswer by the witness: I would describe E.V. Dobrodeev as a mediocre person, since he\n\ndoes not take care of the children nor participates in their education or provides any help. In or about\n\nJanuary 2017, E.V. Dobrodeev began drinking alcohol to excess. /Signed/\n\nI cannot comment where E.V. Dobrodeev studied since I neither know nor care to know about\n\nthat. Since 2013 E.V. Dobrodeev has been working at [place of work: …], as a driver if I am not\n\nAnnex 40\n\n2\n\nmistaken. I cannot say where E.V. Dobrodeev used to work prior to that because I do not know and\n\nhave never asked about that. I also do not know if E.V. Dobrodeev served in the Armed Forces of the\n\nRF and have never asked him about it. As far as I am aware, E.V. Dobrodeev has not been registered\n\nwith a narcologist or psychiatrist, since he worked as a driver. As for him being held liable in criminal\n\nproceedings, I do not know anything, perhaps, he was held liable in administrative proceedings for a\n\nbreach of traffic rules but I do not know for sure, it is only a suggestion. /Signed/\n\nQuestion by the investigator: Has E.V. Dobrodeev been in the government service in the\n\nRussian Federation (type of government service, whether he participated in military operations, etc.)\n\nAnswer by the witness: I cannot say whether E.V. Dobrodeev used to work for the\n\ngovernment since I do not know that, he has never told me about it and I have not asked. As far as I\n\nam aware, E.V. Dobrodeev has not participated in any military operations, he has never mentioned\n\nit. /Signed/\n\nQuestion by the investigator: Do you or E.V. Dobrodeev have any relatives, friends or\n\nacquaintances living in Ukraine? If yes, where exactly do they live, what is their occupation and in\n\nwhat circumstances did E.V. Dobrodeev last see them?\n\nAnswer by the witness: I have no relatives, friends or acquaintances living in Ukraine.\n\nWhether E.V. Dobrodeev has any relatives, friends or acquaintances in Ukraine I do not know. I\n\ncannot say if E.V. Dobrodeev has met anyone from Ukraine in the past 10 years, but when we lived\n\ntogether, I did not notice anything of the kind, we did not raise this topic and, as far as I am aware,\n\nhe did not travel to Ukraine when we lived together or communicated. /Signed/\n\nQuestion by the investigator: What is your attitude to the ongoing military operation in\n\nsouth-eastern Ukraine? What was E.V. Dobrodeev’s attitude to it?\n\nAnswer by the witness: I do not have any relation to the military operation in the southeastern\n\nUkraine and I have not read about this topic, not even in the news, since I am not interested.\n\nI haven’t raised this issue with E.V. Dobrodeev either and I cannot say anything about his attitude to\n\nthe said military operations because I am unaware of his attitude or position in this regard. /Signed/\n\nQuestion by the investigator: Has E.V. Dobrodeev travelled to south-eastern Ukraine since\n\n2013? If yes, when and with what aim?\n\nAnswer by the witness: I lived with E.V. Dobrodeev from 2013 to September 2017 and I\n\nwas unaware that he made any visits to Ukraine in the said period /Signed/\n\nsince he has never told me about it. I cannot say anything with regard to E.V. Dobrodeev’s life,\n\ninterests and travel outside the Russian Federation since September 2017 because we do not keep in\n\ntouch and we are unconcerned with each other’s lives. I know from E.V. Dobrodeev’s relatives that\n\nhe is currently unemployed because in February 2019 he was diagnosed with [disease: …] and\n\nsuffered from memory loss as a result of that illness, as far as I know from E.V. Dobrodeev’s relatives,\n\nbut I cannot say how it has affected his conduct or interests. /Signed/\n\n[…]\n\nWitness /Signed/\n\n(signature)\n\nThe following statements were made prior to, during or upon completion of the interrogation of\n\nthe witness by the following participants: witness I.A.

On the same day, PERSON_1, while at ADDRESS_1, using his own mobile telephone with\n\ncall number NUMBER_1, intentionally informed a member of the terrorist organisation “DPR”, the\n\nperson in command of an armed surveillance unit of the “DPR”, who was at the address: 8A Ilyich\n\nStreet in Donetsk, using the latter’s call number NUMBER_2, about the movement of the above\n\nmilitary equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces so that the armed formations of the terrorist\n\norganisation “DPR” could plan and carry out terrorist acts in the future.\n\nThen, throughout February 2015, PERSON_1, while in Kramatorsk of the Donetsk Region,\n\nsystematically observed military equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces consisting of at least 40\n\nUral trucks at Ordzhonikidze Street in Kramatorsk moving in the direction of Slovyansk of the\n\nDonetsk Region. After that, PERSON_1, at some time throughout February 2015 that the\n\ninvestigation could not identify, continuing to realise his criminal intention, while at ADDRESS_1,\n\nusing his own mobile telephone with call number NUMBER_1, intentionally informed the member\n\nAnnex 63\n\n2\n\nof the terrorist organisation “DPR”, the person in command of an armed surveillance unit of the\n\n“DPR”, who was at the address: 8A Ilyich Street in Donetsk, using the latter’s call number\n\nNUMBER_2, about the movement of the above military equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces\n\nso that this information could be illegally used by the armed formations of the terrorist organisation\n\n“DPR” for planning and carrying out terrorist acts in the future.\n\nThen, one day in April 2015, PERSON_1, while in Kramatorsk of the Donetsk Region, spotted\n\nofficers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine guarding motor bridges at the intersection of\n\nSaltykova Shchedrina, Zaliznychna, and Gorkoho Streets in Kramatorsk. On the same day,\n\nPERSON_1, acting intentionally and with a single criminal intention, while at ADDRESS_1, using\n\nhis own mobile telephone with call number NUMBER_1, reported the above information that the\n\nmotor bridges were guarded to the member of the terrorist organisation “DPR”, the person in\n\ncommand of an armed surveillance unit of the “DPR”, who was at the address: 8A Ilyich Street in\n\nDonetsk, using the latter’s call number NUMBER_2, so that this information could be illegally used\n\nby the armed formations of the terrorist organisation “DPR” for planning and carrying out terrorist\n\nacts in the future.\n\nAdditionally, between 20 and 29 June 2015, PERSON_1 received from persons unidentified by the\n\ninvestigation information about the movement on 21 June of a military convoy of the Ukrainian\n\nArmed Forces at Shkilna Street in Kramatorsk in the direction of Krasnoarmiisk of the Donetsk\n\nRegion and about certain units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other military formations that were\n\naccommodated in the Kramatorsk Hotel (45 Sotsialistychna Street) and Kramatrosk City Hospital\n\nNo. 3 (31 Sotsialistychna Street).\n\nThen, on 24 June 2015 at 21:49, PERSON_1, continuing to realise his criminal intention, while at\n\nADDRESS_1, using his own mobile telephone with call number NUMBER_1, intentionally reported\n\nthe above information about the movement on 21 June of a military convoy of the Ukrainian Armed\n\nForces and the accommodation of personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other military\n\nformations, to the member of the terrorist organisation “DPR”, the person in command of an armed\n\nsurveillance unit of the “DPR”, who was at the address: 8A Ilyich Street in Donetsk, using the latter’s\n\ncall number NUMBER_2, so that this information could be used for planning and carrying out\n\nterrorist acts in the future.\n\nAs reported by Anti-Terrorist Operation headquarters in the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions, the\n\ninformation that PERSON_1 conveyed to the member of the terrorist organisation “DPR”\n\nPERSON_1, the person in command of an armed surveillance unit of the “DPR”, was reliable and\n\nsufficient to cause damage to Ukraine’s defensive capacity.\n\nOn 20 July 2015, PERSON_1 was detained by law enforcement officers, thus ending his criminal\n\nactivities aimed at assisting the terrorist organisation “DPR”.\n\nIn the court session, PERSON_1 fully admitted his guilt and explained to the court that, in early\n\nFebruary 2015, while he was at the junction of Ordzhonikidze and Parkova Streets, he spotted three\n\nUral military vehicles moving in the direction of Slovyansk, and in February–March 2015, he saw at\n\nthe same place around 40 military trucks moving in the direction of Slovyansk, and conveyed that\n\ninformation, using his mobile telephone, to PERSON_3 who was a member of the terrorist\n\norganisation “DPR”. Besides, he also notified the latter about the bridge that was guarded.\n\nAdditionally, he learnt from people that officers of the Security Service of Ukraine lived in the\n\nAnnex 63\n\n3\n\nKramatorsk Hotel and conveyed that information to PERSON_3 as well. In February 2015, when\n\ntalking with PERSON_3, he was furious about the shelling of Kramatorsk. He conveyed that\n\ninformation because he was afraid they would return and do away with him and his family. He took\n\ncare of PERSON_3’s dogs, and received 2,000 hryvnias for that from the latter. He told things he\n\npersonally saw, learnt from people, newspapers, and the Internet. He does not sympathise with the\n\n“DPR”. He is neutral. He shows repentance for his crime.\n\nIn the court hearing, the accused PERSON_1 explained that he fully admits his guilt in the crime\n\ncommitted under Part 1 of Article 258-3 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. He petitions the court to\n\nhave his case reviewed under procedure established by Part 3 of Article 349 of the Criminal\n\nProcedural Code of Ukraine.\n\n[…]\n\nPage 6\n\nDECIDED\n\nto find PERSON_1 guilty of the crime under Part 1 of Article 258-3 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine\n\nand to establish a sentence under Article 69 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine in the form of five years\n\nof imprisonment with isolation of the convicted person in a secure penal facility, with no confiscation\n\nof property.\n\n[...]\n\nAnnex 63\n\nAnnex 64\n\nUkraine, Kramatorsk City Court, Case No. 234/16920/15-k, Ruling,\n\n12 October 2015\n\n(excerpts)\n\n1\n\nTranslation\n\nExcerpts\n\nSOURCE: https://reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/52310146\n\nCategory of case No. 234/16920/15-k: Administrative offence cases (since 01.01.2019); In\n\naccordance with procedural law; In accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine;\n\nMotion of the investigator, prosecutor, party to the criminal proceedings.\n\nSent by the court: 15.10.2015.

In spite of heavy losses, the militants have repetitively advanced to close in on the Ukrainian\n\ntroops to the effective range of small arms, acting in small infantry groups, under high-calibre mortar\n\nfire support and occasionally with the use of tanks and other armoured vehicles. And each time, upon\n\nreceiving some good kicks from our fighters, they return to their lines.\n\n[...]\n\nPages 1-2\n\n- The most interesting part began when they realized that now we could use our new positions to lay\n\neffective fire on their checkpoint at the Yasynuvata junction and on the reinforced position under the\n\ndilapidated bridge, from where they constantly fired with mortars, RPGs and SPGs. Now we also\n\ncontrol the shortest path they had to Horlivka, - tell scout fighters of the 58th Separate Mechanized\n\nInfantry Brigade with the call signs “Grek” and “Starshina”.\n\n[...]\n\nWhen they understood that our troops can’t be forced from their positions by such actions, they began\n\nto step up their efforts in the area. Shellings and fire assaults on this and neighbouring positions of\n\nthe Ukrainian army gained permanent character, wherein each time calibre of the “arguments” used\n\nrises. In spite of all provisions of the Minsk agreements, 122mm and 152mm tube artillery has\n\nappeared, as well as several tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. Subsequently, the militants hid\n\nthem in the adjacent woodlands. Moreover, the enemy moved from engagement with the use of\n\nrelatively small subversive-reconnaissance groups to infantry platoon operations.\n\n[...]\n\nCovering from constant heavy artillery barrages and repealing perfidious strikes, our scouts managed\n\nto hold their positions in the ‘Industrial Area’ until the rotation. Our units on this front had to be\n\nsignificantly reinforced, which contributed to the situation’s partial stabilisation.\n\nThe situation there remains turbulent. The militants continue mass shellings. Despite the mines,\n\nbullets, and occasionally shells that ‘pour’ onto their heads, our boys hold their lines in the industrial\n\narea of Avdiivka.
