        "text": "VX-20 History Circa 2012\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Prepping for Poseidon - VP-30 To Welcome First Production P-8A in March - By Clark Pierce Editor - Posted: January 18, 2012 - 6:23pm | Updated: January 18, 2012 - 6:25pm. Squadron's Mentioned: VP-5, VP-16, VP-30, VX-1 and VX-20...\" WebSite: JaxAirNews http://jaxairnews.jacksonville.com/ [19JAN2012]\n\nSince the Naval Air Systems Command PMA 290 program office awarded Boeing the P-8A contract in 2004, thousands of hours of design, development and testing have been devoted to the P-3 Orion/P-8 Poseidon transition. Eight years later, with testing still underway, the VP-30 \"Pro's Nest\" is qualifying the instructors who will train the flight, mission and weapon crews when the first production P-8A arrives at a date to be determined in March.\n\n\"Every day is critical and puts us one step closer to delivering Poseidon to the fleet,\" said VP-30 Commanding Officer Capt. Mark Stevens.\n\n\"So far, thanks to the professionals on our fleet integration team, we're on track for initial operational capability in 2013.\"\n\nAlso, the first of 10 operational flight trainer and nine weapons tactics trainer simulators housed in the P-8A Integrated Training Center were recently accepted by VP-30, the Navy's largest fleet replacement squadron (FRS) located at NAS Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n\"We're in our 'train-the-trainer' period where our initial cadre of 12 pilots, naval flight officers, acoustic and non-acoustic operators are sharpening their operational skills in the new technically advanced flight and mission simulators,\" said Stevens.\n\nHe added, \"We've sent about 80 maintainers to train with VX-20 at NAS Patuxent River. They'll have their maintenance 'safe for flight' certification by March when our first P-8 arrives. In fact, the whole team should be certified as 'P-8 proficient' when the VP-16 'War Eagles' show up in July at VP-30 for transition training.\"\n\nVP-16 is slated to have eight combat aircrews NATOPS-qualified within six months. Concurrently, VP-30 will train additional P-8 instructors, four at a time, so the squadron will be ready to teach its first FRS syllabus students in August.\n\nWith only two P-8A aircraft available by July, Stevens said, \"Logging the required flight hours for instructors will be challenging. As a result, our first pair of Poseidons will fly about 200 hours per month. By January 2013, we should have six P-8s available  two each for VP-30, VP-16 and VP-5.\"\n\nThe Pro's Nest is currently assigned 17 P-3C Orions  but the numbers of P-3 students and aircraft will start to go down in 2013.\n\nIn the meantime, the VP-30 hangar will be modified to accommodate the P-8's higher tail section.\n\n\"Until the last P-3 is sent to the boneyard, we'll take the 'one team/one fight' approach for both platforms,\" said Stevens.\n\n\"That means our VP-30 Maintenance Department will service both the P-3 and P-8 in our hangar. Obviously, our new Boeing 737-based Poseidons will require less parts and labor than our 40-year-old Orions.\"\n\nWhen the P-3 Orion/P-8 Poseidon transition is complete, VP-30 will be assigned 12 Poseidons. Operational squadrons will be assigned six Poseidons.\n\nAlso working with the P-8A fleet integration team is the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Weapons School located east of VP-30 on Yorktown Avenue.\n\n\"In addition to certifying VP squadrons in ordnance handling and loading for deployment, we teach post-FRS, level 200 through level 500 Weapons Tactics Instructor (WTI) courses,\" said Officer-in-Charge Cmdr. Mike Granger.\n\n\"Our P-8 department has developed advanced readiness training that includes classroom courseware, simulator scenarios and flight events. Our WTIs also worked with VX-1 at NAS Patuxent River to develop the initial ASW ordnance load for P-8, including the new MK 54 lightweight torpedo.\"\n\nThe Navy plans to purchase 108 production P-8A maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe Poseidon's Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with VP-16 is planned for 2013.\n\nRead more at Jacksonville.com: http://jaxairnews.jacksonville.com/military/jax-air-news/2012-01-18/story/prepping-poseidon#ixzz1jt0M3shR\n\nCirca 2011\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: P-8 History \"...The P-8A Poseidon successfully launched the first MK 54 torpedo during a test event in the Atlantic Test Range October 13th, 2011 - Official Navy Photograph - DATE: 111013 - LOCATION: VX-20 NAS Patuxent River, Maryland - BUNO: 168954 - FLT NO: 77 - MSN NO: 151 - PURPOSE OF TEST: BATV 54 (Torpedo) Safe Separation - TEST CONFIG: Station 7 - PILOT(S): LT Larry Malone, USN & Todd White, Boeing - CHASE AIRCRAFT MODEL: T-2C - BUNO: 158581 - PILOT(S): LT Matt Swartzwelder, USN - US Navy Photography by Liz Wolter...\" [28OCT2011]\n\nCirca 2010\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: VX-20 History \"...A P-3 crew from VX-20 at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, were conducitng a sonobuoy test south of NAS Key West, Florida. Shortly after arriving on-station, the aircraft commander rolled the aircraft into a left hand turn when the yoke broke free, resulting in a loss of aileron control. With the yoke freely spinning, he returned the aircraft to level flight using the rudder and elevator. Controls were passed to the copilot, whose yoke was operating. The crew surmised they had a broken interconnect chain between the yokes - a malfunction not addressed by NATOPS. They climbed to a safe altitude, did a controllabily check, dumped fuel to reduce their weight, and landed at NAS Key West, Florida.

Approach Magazine - May - June 2010 Page 12...\" WebSite: Naval Safety Center http://safetycenter.navy.mil/ [05JUN2010]\n\nCirca 2007\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Navy accepts first E-2D - Thursday, May 3, 2007...\" WebSite: TESTER http://www.dcmilitary.com/stories/050307/tester_27943.shtml [27OCT2007]\n\nThe U.S. Navy accepted the first E-2D Advanced Hawkeye during a roll-out ceremony at Northrop Grumman's manufacturing facility in St. Augustine, Fla., Monday.\n\nThe system development and demonstration aircraft, called SDD-1, is the first of 75 Advanced Hawkeyes scheduled for delivery to the Navy. The first Advanced Hawkeye will join a fleet squadron in 2011.\n\nThe E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is a game-changer for the American war fighter. The aircraft is a leap forward in airborne early warning and command and control for our armed forces,\" said Rear Adm. Pete Williams, NAVAIR's program executive officer for Tactical Aircraft. I am very proud that the Navy E-2 program, Northrop Grumman and other members of Team Hawkeye have delivered on a promise to create an aircraft that is the centerpiece for the future carrier flight deck.\"\n\nWith radar that extends the carrier battle group's line-of-sight, the Advanced Hawkeye has a 360-degree array with added electronic scan system and lock-down feature, which allows concentration on targets of potential threat, according to Capt. Randy Mahr, NAVAIR's E-2 program manager.\n\nAugmenting a 40-year E-2 history, this new edition is equipped with the future resources critical to the Navy's network-centric strategy. When the Navy's men and women launch into harm's way, they will be playing for keeps and will have a mission-capable, mission-ready command and control aircraft  exactly what we promised to deliver,\" Mahr said.\n\nThe aircraft's glass cockpit system displays equip the pilot and co-pilot with the ability to switch screens from flight to crew mission displays. This allows four - rather than the traditional three - naval flight officers, to perform the aircraft's command-and-control missions and expand information conveyed to the battlegroup commander.\n\nThe Navy and Northrop Grumman will begin integrated ground testing in St. Augustine. Team Hawkeye has married existing telemetry systems and a mobile test facility to allow transfer of the test unit. The test facility can relocate to test events at St. Augustine, Patuxent River Naval Air Station, any off-site operation or on an aircraft carrier. Navy Test and Evaluation Squadrons Twenty (VX-20) and One (VX-1) will test at Pax River.\n\nWe will be ready in 2011 to be the backbone of the network-centric Navy,\" Mahr said. For years, lighthouses guided Sailors - their vision for the way ahead - just like the Advanced Hawkeye will be the vision and the way ahead for those in the carrier battle group.

The aircraft departed this spring.\n\nArguably, this aircraft has done more for the E-2 fleet than any other plane,\" said Lt. Cmdr. James Borghardt, platform coordinator for VX-20's E-2C integrated product team.\n\nThe Hawkeye was flown by VX-20 flight crew Lt. Cmdrs. Ryan Bryla, Dave Eisen and John Digiovacchino, to the site of its retirement at Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.,\n\nThe aircraft was a valuable tool because it was a dedicated test asset, fully instrumented to evaluate a variety of flight tests,\" said Bryla.\n\nHawkeye 535 arrived at VX-20 directly off the production line in 1988 to serve as a test plane for the benefit of the fleet's E-2C aviators.\n\nThe aircraft served as the primary test asset for the engine upgrade from the Allison T56-A-425 to the Rolls Royce turboprop T56-A-427 used on today's Hawkeyes. The testing provided an assessment of how the older E-2C model aircraft would respond to the new engines and the increase in horsepower. Once the aircraft's engine was upgraded, the flight crew began breaking many world records in the turboprop airplane category. Most records set are still held by this aircraft, including the altitude-without-payload record of 41,253 feet and the time-to-climb to a height of 3,000 meters record of 3 minutes and 1 second.\n\nHawkeye 535 was used for the evaluation of the all-composite, eight-bladed NP2000 propeller system that is now operational on all squadron E-2s. The tests were used as the foundation for today's ongoing C-2 NP2000 program evaluation.\n\nThe future E-2 community also will benefit from the retiree. Hawkeye 535 completed numerous tests in support of the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which completed its maiden flight Aug. 3.\n\nHawkeye 535 provided almost 20 years of service to keep naval aviators safe, capable and current. It provided the necessary test results on which our team could base many concepts for the Hawkeye of the next 40 years\", said Capt. Randy Mahr, NAVAIR's Hawkeye program manager.\n\nSince its arrival at the air depot in California, Hawkeye 535 has been dismantled and its parts sent back to the Navy supply system. This process gives the E-2?C-2 production line access to materiel not in-stock or with long procurement lead-times, reducing maintenance turn-around-time.\n\nThe aircraft will continue to serve by providing readily available parts to the operational fleet and improve mission-readiness,\" said Leon Julienne, deputy program manager of planning for Fleet Readiness Center Southwest, NAS North Island, Calif.\n\nVX-20 will acquire another fully instrumented aircraft for testing like Hawkeye 535, when its successor, the first E-2D Advanced Hawkeye arrives in the winter of 2009.\n\nCopyright © 2007 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Chief test pilot to relieve VX-20 CO at ceremony - Thursday, November 9, 2006...\" WebSite: DCMILITARY.COM http://www.dcmilitary.com/stories/110906/tester_27830.shtml [09NOV2006]\n\n(L) Cmdr.

We have married an NGC trailer and Navy ground test stations to get the testing done safely and efficiently by using a mature and proven system put in a mobile unit,\" said Dennis Normyle, telemetry engineering lead.\n\nNormyle explains the marriage provides savings to the Navy by providing the ability to validate test points on the ground in preparation for first flight that would normally be gathered in the air during a much more comprehensive flight test plan after completion of the first aircraft.\n\nIn the past, ground and flight testing would take place twice - first by industry, and then by the Navy test team. Integrated teaming allows joint testing and prior-to first flight, the time and opportunity to develop and build strong working relationships with the people we will be flying this first aircraft with,\" said Lt. Drew Ballinger of VX-20, who will be part of the first aircrew to fly an Advanced Hawkeye.\n\nThe testing unit also allows engineers to gather real-time data from systems operating simultaneously.\n\nWe have the ability to test cutting edge systems without reinventing  using existing telemetry systems that will transfer from location to location to perform tests on developmental systems during operational system tests that will occur in St. Augustine, here at VX-20, and at any carrier or off-site operation events,\" said Normyle.\n\nThe trailer will be operational this fall and will travel to Florida next spring to begin ground testing when the first E-2D rolls off the NGC production line, which continues to pack the first Advanced Hawkeye airframe with the latest in net-centric warfare avionics.\n\nAs the test trailer develops, anticipation of first flight builds among the Advanced Hawkeye project and test officer team. The group of five manages approximately 15 test plans in various specialized areas, such as missions systems, radar and communications. Each crew member is paired with an industry counterpart to work as co-leads on the testing and plans for first flight.\n\nThis is the biggest project going on right now. Our approach is one of excitement and eagerness and we are looking forward to making a difference in the E-2 community,\" said Ballinger.\n\nThe five officers are recent test pilot school graduates and received their assignments two months after graduation. Today, they are flying current E-2 tests in preparation for their first flight one year from now.\n\nAcross the program, integration and partnering are taking place. Program engineers, logisticians and net-centric warfare teams are speaking each other's languages and breaking through barriers between specialties to address future training now,\" said Capt.

RIMPAC 2006 brought together military forces from Australia, Canada, Chile, Peru, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nFor the GHMD participation in RIMPAC, the aircraft was based at Edwards AFB, Calif. Operations in Hawaiian airspace demanded a flight of roughly 2,500 miles each way to reach the operating areas, a task that fully exercised the range and endurance of the aircraft and its crew. Flight crews from test squadron VX-20, which operates the GHMD aircraft for Naval Air Systems Command PMA-263, were reinforced by personnel from the USAF's 452nd Flight Test Squadron.\n\nIn four flights, for nearly 100 hours of flight time, the GHMD aircraft explored the use of high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft, and provided more than 24 hours of persistent, maritime surveillance in a variety of scenarios to Coalition Forces, Maritime Component Commander, located in Hawaii, as well as to USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Bonhome Richard. The tasks performed by GHMD included maintenance of maritime situational awareness, tracking of contacts of interest, and imagery support for amphibious and strike operations - precisely the kinds of tasks that the Navy frequently must perform in defense of the United States.\n\nThe lessons learned from GHMD operations are providing support for the Navy's future unmanned maritime surveillance program, the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) system. These lessons include analyzing the effects of available time-on-station following delays en-route to a distant area of responsibility, and the associated consequences in a dynamic coalition maritime environment.\n\nThroughout RIMPAC, imagery and tracks from the GHMD aircraft were transmitted to NAS Patuxent River, where they were analyzed by a team from Navy squadrons VX-20, VX-1, and VC-6 and forwarded to exercise participants in Hawaii - a round trip of 10,000 miles, not including the distance involved in the satellite links. The ability of the GHMD system to accomplish this is a great demonstration of the kind of network-centric warfighting capability that will form the core of the Navy's future capabilities,\" said Dave Seagle, Navy lead for GHMD.\n\nThe GHMD aircraft, manufactured by Northrop-Grumman, is a variant of the USAF RQ-4A Global Hawk used since 2001 to support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. With a wingspan of 116 feet, a length of 44 feet, and a gross weight of 25,600 lbs, the Global Hawk is the largest unmanned aircraft in service. It is also one of the most capable, operating at altitudes in excess of 60,000 ft for more than 30 hours. Sensors on the GHMD aircraft include a radar with maritime search, synthetic aperture, and inverse synthetic aperture capabilities; an electronic camera operating in both the visible light and infrared spectra, and an electronic support measures system.\n\nThis year's RIMPAC exercise was the twentieth in a series of exercises conducted since 1971. More than 40 ships, six submarines, 160 aircraft and almost 19,000 Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Soldiers and Coastguardsmen participated in RIMPAC training operations. RIMPAC is intended to enhance the tactical proficiency of participating units in a wide array of combined operations at sea. By enhancing interoperability, RIMPAC helps promote stability in the Pacific Rim region to the benefit of all participating nations. This year's exercise included a variety of surface combatant ships, submarines, tactical aircraft, and amphibious forces. The United States Third Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Barry Costello, was responsible for overall exercise coordination.\n\nThe Navy's UAS program office is completing it's Persistent Unmanned Maritime Airborne Surveillance (PUMAS) broad agency announcement (BAA), which is intended to solicit industry's inputs in mapping the way forward for the Navy's UAS family of systems, including BAMS. PUMAS, combined with GHMD's active role the Navy's Sea Trial events, has afforded the Navy valuable insight into a variety of capabilities that contribute to the Navy's overall UAS missions in support of Naval and Marine forces afloat.\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Hawks, hounds test glowing propellers - Thursday, June 8, 2006 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/060806/41837-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nDrema Ballengee-Grunst\n\nThe NAVAIR E-2/C-2 community is testing propeller paint to enhance ground crew awareness of Hawkeye and Greyhound aircraft during low- or no-light operations to prevent propeller strikes.\n\n\"The low-light-level paint provides a visual warning when the aircraft is turning engines and will enhance situational awareness during all phases of night operations,\" said Capt. Randy Mahr, E-2/C-2 program manager. \"This places the Navy's safety-first approach front and center in the E-2/C-2 community.\"\n\nThe propellers on the E-2 and C-2 fleet are marked with red and white stripes that are visible by day. Test and evaluation squadron VX-20 here is testing a new high-performance, low-light illumination paint enabling the propeller to be seen under all light conditions. The paint must provide enough afterglow to warn flight deck Sailors without distracting pilots during shipboard operations.\n\nThe initial operational evaluation was completed at VAW-121 in Norfolk, Va., during April 2005. Following successful results and feedback from squadron safety personnel regarding carrier night operations, VAW-124 deployed one of its aircraft with both propellers painted during a six-month cruise on the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\"The propellers glow in the areas where it is most important for them to be seen. On the bow and stern - particularly on dark, moonless nights - the propellers show up and make a huge difference as you approach them at either end. All of the maintainers commented while out on deployment how much better these propellers work than the others,\" said the squadron's maintenance officer, Lt. Cmdr. Tom Gelker, who returned from the deployment in mid-March.\n\nOn-going test results show that after eight months and one hundred hours of logged flight time, engineers observed minimal wear on the propeller. During testing February 28, engineers started the propeller at 8 p.m. and upon return at 4:30 the following morning, the afterglow on the spinning propeller was still visible. VAW-124 reported the same.\n\n\"The propellers glowed a lot longer than we thought they would even after returning from hours of flight\", said Gelker.\n\nThe product incorporates strontium aluminate photo luminescent phosphors. The product developed in the mid-1990s, releases visible light after absorption of energy from UV components of light - both from natural and artificial sources. The paint fully charges in minutes, can be repeatedly re-charged, is neither radioactive nor hazardous. Once the light source is removed, the luminance dims slowly with time.\n\nThe technology behind the paint is provided to the Navy under the small business innovative research program by Defense Holding, Inc., a company that develops and implements emergency evacuation systems. DHI is working closely with Navy aircraft maintainers to train them in the application of the new paint.\n\n\"The product is equally easy to store, easy to mix, apply and remove, and we believe, will provide no more maintenance than the current paint being used on the propellers\", said DHI's Joe Jones.\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Global Hawk finds new nest - Wednesday, March 29, 2006 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/032906/40450-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nSandra Schroeder\n\nThe U.S. Navy's first Global Hawk unmanned air system (UAS), N-1, an RQ-4A (BuNo 166509), arrived here Tuesday, its new home. The vehicle is one of two RQ-4A aircraft that the Navy has acquired through the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program under the management of the Navy's UAS program office, PMA-263.\n\nThe GHMD N-1 aircraft, operated by test squadron VX-20, with support from a Navy-contractor integrated product team, will help develop Navy concepts of operations, and tactics, techniques and procedures to support integration of a persistent unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability into the fleet. The GHMD program's Global Hawk represents the largest and most advanced unmanned system in the American military.\n\nWith the arrival at Patuxent River, the GHMD team will first complete local area system checkout and training. Then, work ups begin in preparation for the Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX) set for April 2006. JEFX 06 is an Air Force Chief of Staff directed series of experiments that combines live, virtual and constructive air, space and ground force simulations. Operated from Patuxent River for this upcoming experiment, GHMD N-1 will demonstrate the utility of a high altitude, long endurance UAS equipped with sensors to collect and share persistent maritime ISR data and enhance maritime domain awareness for U.S. Northern Command and other federal agencies.\n\nSince its first flight Oct. 6, 2004, GHMD N-1 has logged more than 200 flight hours. In addition to the normal checkout flights performed on any military aircraft, N-1 has flown from Edwards Air Force Base to characterize the performance of Navy-specific sensor modifications, and participated in the Navy's Trident Warrior 05 experiment. In an example of inter-service cooperation, N-1 has also supported a wide range of tests and training for the Air Force, freeing up its assets for activities overseas.\n\nCapt. Paul Morgan, program manager for PMA-263 said, \"I offer great credit to this government/industry team for the countless hours and immeasurable effort to bring this vehicle home. The Navy now has its greatest opportunity yet, to fully understand and harness the potential of a marinized, high-altitude, long endurance UAS. I look forward to the coming months with great anticipation.\"\n\nOriginally manufactured for the Air Force by Northrop-Grumman, the Global Hawk aircraft is 44-feet long, has a 116-foot wingspan and weighs 25,600 lbs. It can operate at altitudes in excess of 60,000 ft., and remain aloft for 30 hours.

As one of the test plan co-authors, he is responsible for data analysis from this series of tests.\n\nData is the most critical part of the program,\" said Szynborski. Accurate interpretation of the data is vital to mission success, and this is probably the most challenging project I've ever worked on.\"\n\nAccording to Szynborski, some of the analysis is being worked through a collaborative effort with the Coast Guard headquarters Office of Aeronautical Engineering in Washington, D.C., the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center in Elisabeth City, N.C., and the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in Groton, Conn.  adding a joint and unique perspective to the test efforts.\n\nWe're presently in the data reduction stage,\" said Barthelmes, but we're hopeful to have our results complete by Oct. 1.\"\n\nBob Blevins is project coordinator and works as a liaison between NAVAIR and the Coast Guard.\n\nSearch radar can pinpoint small things far away,\" explained Blevins, while weather radar scan broad areas. We wanted to know when our calibrated targets (ten, five and one square meter each), the USCG six-man raft and man in the water would show up on each of the radar screens.\"\n\nAccording to Blevins, the test aircraft flew racetrack\" patterns finding the maximum range they could each detect the targets at different altitudes.\n\nWe did inner bay testing which was local and low sea state,\" he said, and then we ran out over the Atlantic where there were higher sea states for more tests.\"\n\nAccording to Barthelmes, another aspect of the testing was to record corporate knowledge.\n\nOur individual (aircraft) communities know their radar capabilities,\" he said, but we need to document that knowledge and then feed it into our new search and rescue model.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard has two new radars already under contract  one for the new HC-235A Puffin, and one for the HC-130J. The HC-130H radar is also being reconfigured.\n\nThe six Coast Guard aircraft participating in the test included the Falcon jet (HU25), the C130H and C130J. Rotary wing Coast Guard aircraft included in the test are the HH60J, the HH65C and the MH68. The NAVAIR range clearance AIRTECH C-12 also participated with a belly mounted USCG type radar.\n\nFor more information about the joint Navy?Coast Guard radar test, contact Bob Blevins NAVAIR?USCG liaison at robert.blevins@navy.mil.\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...NMCRS fund drive kicks off - Wednesday, February 15, 2006 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/021506/39707-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nThe NAS Patuxent River Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society (NMCRS) will kick off its annual fund drive Wednesday, at 8 a.m. in Building 401.\n\nThis fund drive allows us to help our own.

Cmdr. Harry Errington, the Wing's maintenance awards are given to the top maintenance officer and chief each year. This year Col. Joe Mortensen, Naval Test Wing Atlantic commander, presented the awards to VX-20 Sailors Lt. Cmdr. Tim Norton and Aviation Structural Mechanic Senior Chief Mark Seganos Monday during a ceremony in the Cedar Point Officers' Club. Mortensen announced the awards with Oscar flair. He said, with a sly grin, \"and the Errington goes to,\" and then dramatically paused as if waiting for an unheard drum roll before revealing the names to the audience.\n\nThe Wing renamed its annual maintenance officer and maintenance chief awards in 2002 in honor of Errington, an icon at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland and among the aviation maintenance community.\n\nThe honor is clearly the award winners'.\n\nNorton, the VX-20 Maintenance officer, said that he considers this award a group award, not an individual one.\n\n\"Lt. Cmdr. Norton embodies the vision, tenacity, maintenance expertise, and legacy of the aviation maintenance officer for whom this award is named,\" said Capt. Steven Wright, VX-20 commanding officer. \"Like Harry Errington, Norton is a consummate aviation maintenance professional who has devoted his career to the improvement of aircraft readiness, combining a sincere desire to 'fix' the system of aviation repair and servicing with a genuine interest in his personnel. \"\n\nNorton is a mustang -- a Navy officer who has come up through the enlisted ranks -- who's been in the Navy since 1978, and after A school was rated as an electrician's mate. After serving aboard USS America (CV 66) in Operation Desert Storm, Norton was promoted to chief petty officer, and then he earned his commission as ensign in the Navy.\n\n\"The award is a team award,\" Norton said. \"Every guy does their own part. It's a huge team and a huge team effort.\"\n\nEverybody does their part in the maintenance shop to make sure the development and test of the Navy's big wing aircraft keeps going, said Norton, a Jacksonville, Fla. native.\n\nNorton said he is honored to be named the Harry Errington Maintenance Officer of the Year Award.\n\n\"He's a hallmark of Naval aviation and the LDO community,\" Norton said. He's a wonderful guy to work with. Harry has been in Naval aviation longer than [Seganos] and I have been alive combined.\"\n\nSeganos, a Pennsylvania native, is humbled by the fact that he earned the honor. The competition was impressive, he said. Both Norton and Seganos take pride in the fact that VX-20 swept the awards this year, both noting that is a rare feat.\n\n\"Seganos is the finest Maintenance Chief I have ever observed. I personally selected him to serve as VX-20's Maintenance Master Chief,\" Wright said. \"As the heart and soul of my maintenance department, Senior Chief Seganos epitomizes the traits of leadership, vision, tenacity, and unequalled excellence. His relentless pursuit of mission completion through mentorship of young Sailors and Marines drives the successes achieved by VX-20.\"\n\nNAS Patuxent River, Maryland is a different kind of military base. Both Norton and Seganos said that it takes a little getting used to understanding how things work here as compared with being at a traditional Naval air station.\n\n\"There's a big change dealing with the contract world and contract maintenance,\" Seganos said. It takes getting used to for someone coming from the fleet.\n\nErrington enlisted in the Navy in 1951 during the Korean War where he found himself maintaining aircraft like the Bearcat, Hellcat, Skyraider, Mauler, SNB, R-4D and PB-4Y. He even flew in many of the aircraft as an enlisted crewman. By the time he ended his Navy civilian career as the aircraft maintenance department head of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate here he was in charge of maintaining modern aircraft like the A-6, F-14 and F/A-18.\n\nHe officially retired three times -- once as a lieutenant commander in 1974, once as a civil servant in 1989 and once as a museum volunteer in 1998. But, he continues to put in his time to help make NAS Patuxent River, Maryland a world-class facility. His legacy lives on in the men and women in the maintenance field motivated to keep the Navy and Marine Corps flying.\n\n\"To have my name associated with that here at the test center is a great honor for my wife and I,\" Errington said.\n\nNorton and Seganos both said that NAS Patuxent River, Maryland is a special place to work and are savoring their time here.\n\n\"Those two men certainly are leaders on this test center, and have been leaders in the Navy,\" Errington said. \"It was a privilege for me to be there.\"\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Hawkeye tests in-flight refueling - Thursday, January 19, 2006 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/011906/39188-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nBy Drema Ballengee-Grunst\n\nNAVAIR for the first time demonstrated the Navy's premier command-and-control aircraft's potential to refuel and stay in action longer.\n\nDuring flight tests in December and early January, the Hawkeye program (PMA-231) fitted an E-2C with a refueling test probe and successfully connected to a tanker aircraft over the skies of NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. Test and evaluation squadron VX-20 conducted the simulations using the Navy's KC-130 and newest tanker aircraft, the F/A-18E Super Hornet.\n\nVX-20's testing event marks the first time a Navy E-2 demonstrated plugging into the basket. The E-2 aircraft sported a test probe - half of the refueling probe and drogue (basket) system used on a variety of Navy tactical aircraft today.\n\n\"Joint commanders rely heavily upon the E-2 for command-and-control operations during in-theatre missions. Refueling increases the E-2's endurance and broadens its presence,\" said Capt. Randy Mahr, PMA-231 program manager. \"By examining the E-2's role in the Global War on Terrorism as well as here at home in support of Katrina relief, we know the benefits could be of great significance.\"\n\n\"In situations where there is a need to be there, it is always better to be able to stay there,\" said E-2 pilot Lt. Cmdr. Hugh Winkel.\n\nProgram engineer Chris Gay said if the Navy formalizes a refueling program for the E-2, more follow-on testing will include evaluating the performance during unusual or difficult operations.\n\n\"These tests would be performed in less-than-ideal weather conditions and mission scenarios with a variety of tanker aircraft,\" said Jason Brys, another program engineer.\n\nDuring testing, the aircraft plugged into the basket without actually refueling, to evaluate flying qualities, noise, field of view and basket movement during the normal process of transferring fuel. The team made 16 successful connections in December with a KC-130 and connected with a Super Hornet from NAS Patuxent River, Maryland test and evaluation squadron VX-23 in a flight lasting just over an hour Jan 5.\n\nThe program will evaluate testing results to determine whether it is beneficial to create a full testing program.\n\nThe program looks to E-2 aviators when evaluating mission aircrew requirements. If implemented, the new refueling capability will appear first on the fleet's E-2C Hawkeye 2000 variant. The E-2D would receive the probe as a retrofit following the Advanced Hawkeye's initial production, which is underway at Northrop Grumman's St. Augustine, Fla. plant.\n\nRefueling has been a concept circulating in the E-2 community for some time, including previous tests executed with limited instrumentation and without using a probe. Test goals were achieved by simulating the refueling pre-contact position behind the basket with no temperature rise to the aircraft. This was a precursor to current testing in which crews used an E-2 equipped with testing instrumentation. During the recent flights, the team attached photo markers to the E-2 structure to help photographically measure aircraft position while recording temperatures and pressures and other test indicators of interest to the team.\n\n\"This success is part of our team's continuing contribution to the Navy-wide goal of delivering the right force, with the right readiness, and at the right cost,\" said Rear Adm. David Venlet, program executive officer for tactical aircraft programs.

NAS Patuxent River, Maryland's test and evaluation squadron, VX-20 then tested the wiring for final return to the fleet.\n\nDuring the ceremony, aircraft records were turned over by PMA 231's Lt. Cmdr. Sean McDermott and Jimmy Fingerle to Cmdr. Brad Brown of VRC-40. McDermott reminded everyone that although the focus for the day was on the first C-2 to be delivered, this success would be followed by the rewire of all C-2s operating in the fleet.\n\n\"One more is already rewired,\" he said, as he reemphasized PMA-231's commitment to deliver approximately five per year through 2012.\n\nBrown, who had the opportunity to spend some time on the rewired aircraft, said that the \"hand-artisan work represented impeccable craftsmanship.\"\n\nThe C-2 plays a key role in carrier operations and is the only aircraft of its kind - transporting mail, cargo, fleet personnel, distinguished visitors and dignitaries to and from the carrier.\n\n\"Replacing the wiring is the most important thing we could do as a community to extend the safety and service life of the aircraft,\" he said.\n\n\"This success is part of our team's continuing contribution to the Navy-wide goal of delivering the right force, with the right readiness, and at the right cost,\" said Rear Adm.

The tests conducted will determine the capability of the radar to find and track airborne targets, and to pass sensor information in real time to ground facilities across the country.\n\nThis flight illustrated the highly joint nature of the Global Hawk program. The air vehicle, RQ-4A, is a Navy aircraft flown by Navy contractor operators - and was flown from Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on an Air Force test program. Data from the sensors was passed to Air Force and Navy ground facilities.\n\nThe RQ-4A Global Hawk, manufactured by Northrop-Grumman, is the most sophisticated UAS in the American military. With a length of 44 feet, a wingspan of 116 feet, and a gross weight of 25,600 pounds, the Global Hawk is comparable in size to a U-2 or a small business jet. Operating at an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet, the Global Hawk endurance is well in excess of 24 hours. Sensors include radar and a high-resolution digital camera operating in both visible and infrared spectra. Data is passed to the ground stations in real time by line-of-sight and high-speed satellite communications links.\n\nThe Global Hawk made its first flight on Feb. 28, 1998. Since then, RQ-4As have flown approximately 7,000 hours, including 4,000 combat hours in support of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-263, has acquired two GHMD aircraft and associated ground stations to support the development of tactics and operating procedures for future unmanned maritime patrol systems. To perform maritime search missions, the sensor suite carried by the GHMD aircraft has undergone extensive software modifications enabling new maritime radar modes, specialized software in both the aircraft and ground stations, and the incorporation of passive electronic sensors, unique to the Navy UASs. These modifications are being tested by test and evaluation squadron, VX-20, which will operate the GHMD system in flight tests and tactical experiments. After initial sensor testing on the West Coast, the Navy's Global Hawks will be ferried during the winter of 2006 to Pax River, the main operating base for the system.\n\nPEO (W) Public Affairs Office\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Flight tests done for C-130J mission package - Thursday, October 20, 2005 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/102005/37745-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nThe Joint Tactical Airborne Multi-Mission System (JTAMMS) completed flight testing at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland aboard a U. S. Coast Guard C-130J aircraft Sept. 13. JTAMMS is a USCG led quad-service effort bringing together USCG, USAF, USN and USMC assets and capabilities to demonstrate a C4ISR mission package for the C-130J aircraft. JTAMMS is the first NAVAIR C4ISR mission suite for the newest member of the venerable C-130 family, the C-130J model. It also represents the first carriage of the Northrop-Grumman LITENING AT pod on any version of the C-130. The system was developed by the AIR 4.5 Hairy Buffalo team under CDR Ron Carvalho, with Mr. David Allocca acting as Lead Engineer. Systems Engineering/Class Desk functions were performed by AIR 4.1's Mr. Tom Esposito, the VX-20 test team was lead by LT Rob Barthelmes (USCG) and Mr. Mark Byers, and overall NAVAIR Project Manager was Mr. Bob Blevins (AIR 1.1).\n\nThe NAVAIR project team developed JTAMMS and prototyped it, the USCG Aircraft Rework and Supply Center Elizabeth City, NC fabricated and installed the required aircraft modifications, the USAF provided the universal wing pylon to carry the LITENING AT pod, and the USMC provided the LITENING AT sensor pod, which was mounted on the aircraft outboard wing station. Northrop-Grumman, also a core team member, integrated the pod and developed an unclassified tactical exploitation system for use with JTAMMS. Lockheed-Martin, developer of the C-130J, contributed to the flight clearance process by providing structural suitability analysis. The prototype effort including limited flight test was completed in less than 20 months.\n\nJTAMMS is a Roll-On/Roll-Off (RORO) \"pallet\" sensor suite that requires no permanent modifications to the airframe. This RORO pallet includes seating for two operators. The JTAMMS suite is connected to the Northrop Grumman LITENING AT pod, and cued by the aircraft radar cursor position. A monitor driven by the JTAMMS suite is mounted on the flight deck to provide situational awareness to the pilots. A wiring kit that can be readily installed or removed by maintenance crews is installed in the aircraft with no permanent modifications. Once the airplane is wired the wiring kit can be left in the aircraft even when the JTAMMS suite is not installed as it has no impact on the basic airframe. The open architecture of the JTAMMS system allows new sensors and mission systems to be rapidly and cost effectively integrated into the suite. Potential system spiral upgrades include wide band satellite communications, search radar, and electronic support measures (ESM) with the selected emitter identify (SEI) system.\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Maritime program office leadership changes hands - Thursday, October 6, 2005 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/100605/37523-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nRenee Hatcher\n\nCapt.

In addition to P-8A, Rixey will oversee NAVAIR's P-3, EP-3 and its future replacement, and S-3 acquisition programs. PMA-290 also has a robust International Programs Department, as well as an extensive Propulsion and Power Department.\n\nRixey, a native of Monterey, Calif., started his naval career in August 1978 with enlistment and assignment to the Naval Academy Preparatory School leading to graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1983. He was designated a naval aviator in August 1986.\n\nInitially assigned to Patrol Squadron 17, Rixey received designations as a patrol plane commander, mission commander, NATOPS instructor pilot, and defensive air combat maneuvering instructor while making deployments to Adak, Alaska; Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines; and Diego Garcia.\n\nFrom March 1990 to September 1992 he earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering and follow-on engineer's degree in aeronautics at the Naval Post Graduate School.\n\nRixey reported aboard USS Constellation (CV-64) home-ported in San Diego, where he served as a catapult and arresting gear officer, V-2 division officer, and assistant air officer (Mini-Boss). He participated in a deployment from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to the West Coast taking him around the Horn of South America. Additionally, he participated in numerous exercises and a deployment to the Western Pacific.\n\nAfter completing fleet replacement squadron training with Patrol Squadron 30, he reported to Patrol Squadron 40, Whidbey Island, Wash., where he served as safety officer and maintenance officer. He completed a deployment to Diego Garcia and served as officer in charge of the Patrol Squadron Detachment at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn July of 1997, Rixey reported to NAVAIR as the P-3 Training Systems Program Manager (PMA-205). His responsibilities included the acquisition and management of all P-3 aircrew and maintenance training and trainer devices.\n\nIn March 2000, Rixey reported as executive officer of the \"Wizards\" of Special Projects Patrol Squadron 2 and in March 2001, he assumed the duty as the squadron's commanding officer until March 2002. His command participated in combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The squadron was the recipient of the 2001 Battle \"E\" award.\n\nRixey reported to the Defense Acquisition University for Acquisition Program Manager Level III training and subsequently reported to NAVAIR as the deputy program manager for the ACAT 1D P-8A MMA Program.

Evolving the concept to air demonstration in just seven weeks, Air NAVAIR will bring new capabilities to the E-2 Hawkeye in fulfilling homeland defense and anti-surface warfare missions. The Navy anticipates the E-2 UAIS system will significantly enhance combat identification and improve the use of battle force assets.\n\nThe UAIS is a navigation aid commonly used by commercial ships exceeding 300 tons. The system, for the most part, provides port security, traffic management, navigation safety and collision avoidance. Unlike the transponder broadcast systems currently used by the shipping industry and the U.S. Coast Guard, the fleet will operate with a receive-only capability in the Hawkeye. The aircraft will use its existing target detection capability combined with reception of UAIS ship-to-ship transmissions to improve fleet situational awareness. By employing the UAIS, aircraft and helicopters that would normally need to visually identify a target of unknown origin can focus on other critical missions.\n\nThe Hawkeye's current system provides ship location, course and speed. Using the UAIS system, the Hawkeye will also receive the ship's Maritime Mobile Service Identity number, which is the unique identification of a ship, its International Maritime Organization number, an identification related to the ship's construction, a radio call sign, the ship's name and type, the ship's destination; and its dimensions.\n\nNAVAIR's E-2/C-2 program at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland (PMA 231) engineered and tested the system for the fleet.\n\n\"The discovery, development and use of this technology for the E-2 aircraft will enhance and advance airborne ship-to-shore communication in the command and control arena to support the warfighter,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Dennis Wojcik, the program's Network Centric Warfare Integrated Product Team Lead.\n\nEast Coast VAW-124, Bear Aces, aboard Naval Air Station Norfolk, Va., were outfitted with a demonstration UAIS. After successful results, the Navy will consider the system for full integration into the remaining E-2 fleet as well as the Advanced Hawkeye. Results have been very favorable so far.\n\n\"The initial report from the squadron on deployment using this initial configuration is satisfied with the system's operation . . .

In the back of the aircraft, loadmaster Sandy Hartkemeyer and five aircraft maintainers were turned into projectiles in the open tube of the fuselage, along with a storm of potentially deadly gear and supplies.\n\nThe operating procedures for the burly C-130 Hercules strictly prohibit \"aerobatics of any kind (including those that produce a negative-G condition), intentional spins, excessively nose-high stalls, steep dives, and any other maneuvers resulting in excessive accelerations.\" Such deviations, it warns, can stress the airframe to failure, lead to unrecoverable loss of control, or both. In a matter of seconds, the plane had involuntarily broken every rule in the book.\n\nIn the cockpit, pilot Neblett was fighting for control; he had immediately disengaged the autopilot and was now making control inputs that his experience as a test pilot told him should arrest the spin. Copilot Dan Sanders, who had pulled the throttles back to idle, was scanning the instruments and fighting his instinct to reach for the yoke himself.\n\n\"It was a conscious effort; I had to throw my hands up,\" said Sanders, who accumulated 4,600 hours as a Marine Corps C-130 Hercules pilot before retiring as a major a year ago.\n\n\"Out of 11 people onboard, only two could do anything about it, and one of them had to let go,\" Neblett said.\n\nBehind the pilots, flight engineer Wray Emrich had flown out of his seat and slammed off the ceiling of the cockpit; he later found wounds in his scalp that conformed to the arrangement of switches over his head. He managed to grab hold of his seatbelt and drag himself back down, then held on with all his strength during the violent ride, like a rodeo cowboy trying to stay on a bucking bull. Flight test engineer Ray Bacorn and navigator Craig Homer were hanging on as best they could, while everything that wasn't nailed down became airborne.\n\n\"The only thing that didn't move,\" Neblett said, \"was our instrument panel.\"\n\nThroughout the airframe, the noise was tremendous.\n\nIn the cockpit, everyone was shouting to be heard, Sanders said; his intercom switch was on the control yoke, which he could not risk grabbing.\n\nOther occupants reported hearing the airframe groan under the strain of all the G-forces.\n\nThe most ominous sound for Emrich was the howling of the engines, though; the incredible onset of airspeed had caused the props themselves to over-speed, reaching 106 percent of their correct RPM. Flameouts were very real and deadly possibilities. But the engines held, a fact that Sanders attributes in part to the excellent responsiveness of the new Electronic Propeller Control System that was installed on the plane for testing.\n\nIn the C-130, engine speed and propeller speed are supposed to stay constant throughout flight; the actual velocity of the aircraft is controlled by changing the pitch angle of the propeller blades. The EPCS replaces the old hydraulic and mechanical system that controls propeller pitch, instead using electronic sensors and actuators that should be more reliable and respond rapidly to inputs and changes. No one, however, had ever anticipated validating the new system's performance under such dire circumstances.\n\nAs the altitude wound away, Neblett managed to get the wings level for a moment, long enough for a glimmer of hope. Then, with the life raft still attached to the left half of the tail, the KC-130T went inverted again.\n\n\"I remember thinking, 'We're never going to come out of this,\" recalled Emrich.\n\n\"Twenty-two years flying in the Navy,\" thought Hartkemeyer, \"and not even a year here at VX-20, and this is it.\"\n\nStill, no one gave up. Neblett continued his work at the controls, applying the best of his test piloting expertise to regain control of the stricken tanker. At some point the raging airflow over the outside of the fuselage was enough to tear almost all of the life raft free. Neblett worked with Sanders, who had the benefit of a functional Attitude Direction Indicator, and somehow managed to get the wings level again. He pulled back on the yoke, and slowly the plane came out of its speeding dive.\n\nWhen he leveled off, the altimeter read 15,000 feet. The entire episode had lasted less than half a minute, during which the aircraft's maximum rate of descent reached 29,000 feet per minute.\n\nAnd still no one knew exactly what had happened or why, which meant no one knew if it was going to happen again.\n\nHartkemeyer tried to come up on the intercom, but her cord had been ripped apart at the connector.\n\n\"When everything stopped,\" said Emrich, \"I couldn't hear anyone in the back. I needed to know the condition of the airplane and personnel, and no one answered.\"\n\nMiraculously, though, none of the injuries were life-threatening. Despite having taken a terrible beating, Hartkemeyer assumed control of her part of the plane.\n\nNeblett and Sanders concentrated on flying the aircraft and getting pointed toward the nearest airport, which actually involved turning the plane around. Focused on the task at hand on the flight deck, Sanders told Emrich, \"I do not want to know if there's no plane behind us.\"\n\nSanders radioed the authorities at Tri-State Airport in Huntington, W. Va., to say that he had wounded aboard and would be making an emergency landing.\n\nLater, Neblett would praise crew resource management - the right combination of good communication, situational awareness and sharing of the workload - for getting them all through the crisis. Landing checklists were lost somewhere in the wild snowdrifts of paper all over the floor of the cockpit, but procedures were nonetheless executed correctly.\n\nA short time later, Neblett made an uneventful landing, taxied off the runway and shut down the aircraft.\n\n\"Once we hit the ground and cleared the aircraft you begin to come apart,\" said Emrich.\n\nThe day's work was far from over. In the aftermath of the mishap, various Navy and Marine Corps commands had to be contacted, the aircraft had to be secured for investigators, and the local and national media needed to be dealt with. Above all the crew and passengers - whose injuries included broken fingers and a variety of contusions and lacerations - needed medical care and lodging.\n\nNeblett and the rest of the shaken survivors received a generous helping of West Virginia hospitality, particularly from airport officials and the local National Guard and Air National Guard.\n\nIt has been almost half a year since the incident, and today the same crew is flying the same KC-130T, which has been repaired and recertified, on test flights for VX-20. The mishap has become a learning opportunity, briefed to other aviators and maintainers, as well as a permanent piece of C-130 folklore. Neblett received his Air Medal in late August, for somehow writing a happy ending on a story that easily could have concluded with a memorial service.\n\n\"His aeronautical instinct, aggressiveness, and level head led to the remarkable recovery of a non-aerobatic aircraft from uncontrolled flight while sustaining absolutely minimum damage,\" his award citation reads. \"Maj. Neblett's superb airmanship, decisive decision-making, perseverance, and loyal devotion to duty in the face of hazardous flying conditions reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\"\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...VX-20 pilot, crew still on the job after beating odds - Wednesday, September 21, 2005 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/092105/37215-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nJames Darcy\n\nSandy Hartkemeyer is pinned to the ceiling in the back of a KC-130T that is rolling through a death spiral toward the mountains of West Virginia. In the cockpit, co-pilot Dan Sanders is forcing himself to keep his hands off the controls while Maj. Nathan Neblett fights to level the aircraft, without benefit of any attitudinal references.\n\nThe other eight occupants of the aircraft are being slammed against bulkheads or bloodied by flying hardware, and are trying so hard to hold on to whatever they can grab that in some instances their fingers break.\n\nNo one knows why this is happening. No one can see that the 200-pound inflatable life rafts stored in the left wing have deployed in flight, and that one has snagged on the tail's horizontal stabilizer, becoming a massive, asymmetric drag chute. The only thing everyone is sure of, as the altitude winds away and the aircraft tumbles through its second violent inversion, is that this is unquestionably the last minute of their lives.\n\nThat was Apr. 12. And yet today, instead of grave markers they have plaques to commemorate their experience, each bearing an upside-down photo of a C-130. For Neblett there is an Air Medal too, pinned on him recently by Rear Adm. Jeff Wieringa, NAWCAD Commander. And now, with the mishap investigation concluded and some time to process it all, the survivors of what was arguably the most aerobatic flight ever made by a C-130 are sharing their stories.\n\nThe bare facts, as reported at the time of the incident over the Associated Press and CNN, were austere: \"A Navy-operated KC-130T tanker aircraft landed safely at Tri-State Airport near Huntington, West Va., around noon today after declaring an in-flight emergency. The 11 people aboard sustained minor injuries. Three of the 11 were taken to a local hospital for treatment.\n\n\"The aircraft was being operated by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 20 (VX-20), and was traveling from its home at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, Calif. The cause of the incident is under investigation.\"\n\nThat minimalist accounting hardly did justice to the scene investigators found inside the aircraft on the tarmac in West Virginia. Papers were strewn wildly across the flight deck, along with random items brought along in the crew's flight bags. An orange from someone's lunch sat on the deck plate bleeding juice, where a set of wheel chocks had squashed it flat. Anything not anchored in place had become a projectile in the whirling melee that ensued as the aircraft spent almost 9,000 feet of precious altitude in just 27 seconds.\n\nIn the back of the aircraft, makeshift wound dressings stained with blood lay side by side with dented cans of hydraulic fluid, tools, luggage, the lid from the cockpit garbage can, and hundreds of other pieces of gear. Nothing was where it should be; pieces of equipment were crammed into corners, lodged behind cargo webbing, hiding in the rafters.\n\nA second set of wheel chocks, which had been stowed with the first pair under the stairs to the flight deck, hung from the ceiling \"like a pair of sneakers hanging from a telephone wire,\" as Hartkemeyer later recalled.\n\nIt had been a well-ordered environment inside the plane, right up to the moment when the occupants' world was literally turned upside down.\n\nThat spring morning, Neblett was ferrying the crew and a group of maintainers to the desert environment of Twentynine Palms for a series of high-temperature tests on the new Electronic Propeller Control System being developed for the C-130T fleet.\n\nNo one on the test team ever anticipated that the EPCS would play a vital role in saving the aircraft that day.\n\nNeblett and Sanders took off from Pax at about 11:30 a.m. Joining them on the flight deck were Wray Emrich, the flight engineer; Craig Homer, the navigator; and Ray Bacorn, a flight test engineer. Hartkemeyer, the loadmaster in the back, completed the crew.\n\nThey were an experienced group; all totaled, they had accumulated more than 34,000 hours of flight time over their careers. Neblett had been a test pilot with VX-20 for two and a half years, and had 1,200 hours at the controls of C-130s.\n\nFive maintainers also rode in the back, along on the trip to care for the aircraft during its stay in California: Chief Aviation Machinist's Mate Bruce Wolfe, Terrence Kelly, James Coffman, Jeff Summers and Scott Fandrick.\n\nA little more than an hour into the flight, the aircraft was cruising at 24,000 feet and everyone was settling in for the long haul - the equivalent of, \"We've just reached our cruising altitude, feel free to move about the cabin,\" Neblett later said.\n\n\"I had just reclined my seat about three notches,\" said Sanders. He and Neblett were the only two who were still strapped in. In back, a couple people stretched out for naps on troops seats. Wolfe was tucked inside a sleeping bag.\n\nAt 12:43 p.m. local time, the rafts blew. Inside the left wing, there was a sudden malfunction of the mechanism that would deploy and inflate the 20-passenger life rafts if the crew ever needed them. Panels along the top trailing edge of the wing popped open, and the twelve-foot diameter rafts deployed.\n\nHartkemeyer, just starting on her crossword puzzle, felt a hard bump as one of the rafts slammed against the fuselage. That might have been the end of it, if the raft had not then impacted the left horizontal stabilizer on the tail. With 220 knots of cruising speed behind the collision, the raft \"sawed through the aluminum until it hit a stainless steel duct,\" said Sanders. Snagging in the tear in the stabilizer's skin, the raft created a huge amount of drag and interfered with the elevator, which controls the aircraft's pitch.\n\nAll anyone in the aircraft knew, however, was that gravity had suddenly become an enemy.\n\n\"We immediately snap-rolled to the left,\" recalled Neblett. \"All of a sudden we were upside down. Wray was bouncing off the ceiling.\"\n\nIn an instant the aircraft had rolled onto its back, pulling toward the earth as the G-forces began to build.\n\n\"Eleven seconds into it we were 45 degrees nose down, with 350 knots forward air speed,\" Neblett said, based on later data analysis. The maximum safe speed for the aircraft at that altitude is 315 knots. The airspeed indicator pegs out at 354 knots.\n\nLooking outside the cockpit, Neblett and Sanders could see nothing but the featureless gray of the clouds around them. Neblett, who took command of the aircraft, looked to his Attitude Direction Indicator for the artificial horizon and some reference as to which way was up. But his ADI had failed.\n\nIn the rear of the aircraft, people became projectiles amid a chaos of violence and fear.\n\n\"Dan and I were strapped in,\" Neblett said, \"but the guys in back had an 80-foot by 10-foot by nine-foot space in which to play pinball, with them as the pinballs.\"\n\nThose who could find something to grab held on. Those who had nothing to hold, like Hartkemeyer, flew. \"There was nothing more odd to me,\" she said, \"than hearing my own scream.\"\n\n\"I remember looking down at the floor from the ceiling and thinking, 'This is gonna ... hurt,'\" she recalled. It did.\n\nWolfe, wrapped in his sleeping bag when the emergency began, was likewise at the mercy of physics. \"It must have felt like falling down the stairs in a straight jacket,\" Sanders later mused.\n\nFlying through the tumbling steel tube with Wolfe and the others were countless potentially deadly missiles: cans of hydraulic fluid sailed past like cannonballs, and some found their targets.\n\n\"I still have indentations on my body,\" Hartkemeyer said more than three months later. Her bruises, Neblett said, had been exact copies of whatever had hit her.\n\nSanders likened the experience to the astronaut trainer jet that arcs through a negative-G maneuver to provide its passengers with a few moments of airy weightlessness.\n\n\"Imagine that happening back there,\" he said, \"only imagine doing that in a hardware store.\"\n\nNobody knows exactly how many positive or negative Gs the aircraft and its inhabitants actually endured. The maximum positive reading recorded was 3.8 times the force of gravity - the F/A-18 Hornet flown by the Blue Angels maxes out at 7 - but the real number may well have been higher, Neblett said. By the time the aircraft landed, \"the G-meter was severely jacked.\"\n\nNext week: As more goes wrong, a new system proves itself and crew coordination is tested under extremes.\n\n[Editor's note: This is the first installment of a two-part series]\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Chief test pilot to relieve commanding officer at VX-20 - Wednesday, June 1, 2005 - Tester...\" WebSite: DC Military http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/060105/35178-1.shtml [05OCT2006]\n\nBrian Seraile\n\nAir Test and Evaluation Squadron 20's Chief Test Pilot Steven Wright will relieve Commanding Officer Shane Gahagan, at a change of command June 10.

Boeing is modifying the E-6B fleet with a Multi-function Display System flight deck that provides the required hardware and software to operate in RVSM airspace. The process of applying for certification required a joint effort between the PMA-271 (Airborne Strategic Command, Control and Communications), PMA-290 (Air Combat Electronics), VX-20 and the fleet. The certification will allow the E-6 to operate at higher altitudes resulting in greater fuel efficiency.\n\nRVSM is a global program that allows for greater air traffic above 29,000 feet by decreasing vertical separation between aircraft from 2,000 to 1,000 feet. It was first implemented in the North Atlantic in 1997 and recently began over the continental U.S. and Canada on January 20. To fly in RVSM airspace, the aircraft and crew must meet specific FAA and International Civil Aviation Organization requirements.\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nCirca 2004\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...Maintenance burden eased for Hercules - By James Darcy - Thursday, November 11, 2004...\" WebSite: Tester http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/111104/32043-1.shtml [06OCT2006]\n\nAir Test and Evaluation Squadron 20 has successfully completed initial flight tests of an electronic propeller control system for the Navy and Marine Corps' 48 Lockheed C-130T Hercules transports and tankers. The EPCS upgrade will replace a device that is one of the most maintenance-intensive components on the entire airframe, reducing costs and increasing readiness for the C-130T fleet.\n\nThe new controllers have been developed under a cost-saving initiative by Hamilton Sundstrand, manufacturers of the Hercules' propellers, said flight test engineer Justin Garr, who is test team lead for the EPCS program. The Air National Guard, which also operates the C-130, contributed about two thirds of government funding for flight test, he added.\n\nThe new controller has been modified from similar devices on other, newer Hamilton Sundstrand propeller systems, but is still considered off-the-shelf, Garr said.\n\n\"The propellers on these aircraft are very complex pieces of machinery,\" he explained. In the C-130, engine speed and propeller speed stay constant throughout flight; the actual velocity of the aircraft is controlled by changing the pitch angle of the propeller blades.\n\nWhen the pilot pushes the throttles forward, more fuel goes to the engines, causing it to want to turn faster. Instead, a hydromechanical system causes the pitch of the blades to increase, making them bite more air and absorbing the excess energy. This increases the speed of the aircraft, while engine speed stays constant, Garr said.\n\nThat hydromechanical system that makes it all work is a complicated device full of valves and ports that open and close, moving fluid throughout, in order to change the prop pitch. There are no electronic sensors or computer brains making it all work, just an intricate piece of machinery that responds to mechanical forces.\n\n\"The valve housing is the leading maintenance degrader for the aircraft,\" Garr said. \"It's the leading reason a C-130 doesn't go flying.\"\n\nThe EPCS replaces the old system with a device that relies on an electronic speed sensor to command changes in propeller pitch. A new, simpler valve housing is wired into the EPCS box. \"You're digitally mimicking the hydromechanical system,\" Garr said.\n\nBecause software algorithms drive the process, performance can also be tweaked to a greater degree than was previously possible.\n\nThe EPCS also handles the synchronization of propellers between the Hercules' four engines, a task currently managed by a separate device, the \"solid state synchrophaser.\"\n\nFor the first phase of flight testing, the EPCS was installed on the number-three engine of a C-130T only, for risk mitigation purposes. Beginning Sept. 21, VX-20 put the system through almost 12 hours of flight testing.\n\n\"The speed governing was excellent,\" Garr said. One benefit of the software control is a reduction in \"overshoots and undershoots.\" The old system didn't always respond to power increases or reductions as smoothly as desired, resulting in initial over-corrections to the prop pitch. The new software provides a smoother response, Garr said.\n\nFlight tests have been rigorous, to ensure that the Fleet won't get any surprises. \"We wrung [the aircraft] out a lot more than you normally would,\" he said.\n\n\"We asked, 'What if someone just slammed the power levers all the way forward?'\" Garr said. Project test pilots told the engineers that no C-130 pilot would ever do that, since they are trained to increase power gradually.\n\n\"We did it anyway,\" he said.\n\nThe test aircraft is now having EPCS units installed on the remaining three engines in preparation for the next phase of testing, which will focus on the propeller synchronization function. Ground tests are slated to begin in December, and test flights in January. A team from Naval Air Depot Cherry Point, N.C., is handling the integration work.\n\nCost savings for the program will be realized over the life of the aircraft fleet. \"We expect to lose far fewer flights\" Garr said, \"with much better availability and less time in maintenance. We also won't be needing as many spare parts.\"\n\nAt present, the Navy and Marine Corps operate four basic models of the Hercules for aerial refueling and transport: the F, R, T and J. The new J model, which already incorporates an electronic propeller control system, will eventually replace all F and R models.\n\nBut the T models, which were manufactured in the 1980s and 90s, will stay in inventory long enough to make the EPCS program cost-effective, Garr said. VX-20 has also been involved in testing new defensive countermeasure systems - chaff and flare - for the T models.\n\n\"These are tactical aircraft,\" Garr said. \"A lot of people forget that, because they're so big. But these are very robust airplanes.\"\n\nThe Lockheed YC-130 prototype made its first flight in 1954. In the four intervening decades, it has become one of the world's most ubiquitous military transports, with variants flying in a variety of roles for dozens of nations.\n\nCopyright © 2006 Comprint Military Publications - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\nA BIT OF HISTORY: \"...S-3B testing concludes - Wednesday, September 22, 2004...\" WebSite: Tester http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/092204/31268-1.shtml [06OCT2006]\n\nCarrier suitability tests for an upgrade to the S-3B Viking concluded on Sept. 1 at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and the last remaining Patuxent River-based S-3B aircraft was transferred to the fleet.
