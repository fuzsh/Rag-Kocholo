        "text": "In the early 60's, the Thunderbird with the sequential turn signals was all the rage. I had a 1960 Chevrolet Impala Convertible, and wanted to put in sequential turn signals. The tail lights had three lenses, the center one was clear for the back up lights, but would accept a red lens too. So as far as the lights themselves I was all set. I went to the Ford dealer and asked at the parts counter for the turn signal blinker for the Thunderbird. As I was young and naive, I imagine that I thought I would simply connect it the same way it was done in the Thunderbird. Well of course no such luck, and the part was not returnable as it was an electrical part. So here is the short version of what I did, without any schematics, I too am 72 years old and this goes back 60 years or so.\n\nThe Thunderbird turn signal device consisted of a small motor to turn four cams. Three of the cams were used to light the lamps in the proper sequence and the fourth cam was used to keep the motor running until it returned to the home position. Somewhat like the windshield wipers on a car. I removed the standard turn signal blinker and placed a short across it, so that when ever the turn signal was on, I had power there for the entire time. The signal to the rear lamps was now either steady brake or steady turn signal. Of course this was not very useful for this application. However, the front turn signal lamps only have either steady power when the turn signal is on and zero power regardless of the brake switch. Exactly what I was looking for. I used the front turn signal to power the motor with one cam connected, to keep it running to the home position after the turn signal power was removed because the switch had returned to the off position. Now my only problem was to get brake power to the lamps when the brakes were applied and turn signal power for the three cams when it wasn't.\n\nThe simple solution to this was to simply use a multiple contact relay, one set of contacts for each lamp. The front turn signal power along with the power from the fourth return home cam was used to energize the relay. Of course I needed two relays, one for the left side and a second one for the right side. It worked as expected and I was the envy of the town, because I was the only non ford vehicle with the cool sequential turn signals. The whole mechanism fit inside of a plastic box about the size of a shoe box.\n\nSo that was the solution almost 60 years ago. Today I would still remove the standard turn signal blinker, and place a short across the terminals to give me always on power when ever the turn signal is activated. I would still use the front indicator to tell me when the turn signal is activated, thus separating the brake signal. From there, I would either use some relay logic, or perhaps discrete logic, along with some timer circuits (555 comes to mind) or a microprocessor to generate the the necessary rear sequential signals. My choice would be a microprocessor, today they are very easy to use and program.\n\nI am not completely sure how you want the lights to act when the brake petal is pressed, and frankly I would use a PIC style device to implement this, either a basic PIC chip or one of the ones with a higher level programming language pre-loaded (Ardunio, etc).\n\nBut you want a way that does not use code. One way to do this would be to use the old standby 555 timer chip. They can be configured as a one shot, time delay device. You can chain several of them in a ring so that each will trigger the next one in the loop. So they will form a ring counter type circuit.\n\nThen, the first 555 will have a steering diode connected to it’s output and then to the base or gate of a power transistor which drives the first bulb.\n\nThe second one has two steering diodes and they are connected to the base or gate of the first AND second power transistor.\n\nThe third 555 will have diodes that drive three such power transistors. Each of the power transistors is connected to one of the lamps. So when the first timer is triggered, the first bulb comes on. When the second timer is triggered, the first and second bulbs come on, and when the third timer is triggered, all three bulbs will light.\n\nIf you only want one light on for each step in the cycle, just eliminate some of the steering diodes. Additional steering diodes can be connected to the power transistors to activate them when the brake petal is pressed. Additional buffer amplifiers may be needed to get the polarity and current correct for this, depending on the vehicle’s system. The steering diodes will isolate the two functions, brake and directional signals. This does not allow turn signals to flash while the brake pedal is pressed.\n\nAn additional, exclusive OR circuit (CMOS logic chip) could be added between the steering diodes on each power transistor and the base or gate of the transistor. This would allow all three bulbs to light when the brake petal is pressed and then they would turn off one at a time if the turn signal is activated.\n\nIf this is done, then it would be best to use my suggested method for having only one bulb lit at a time by the turn signal circuit. Thus at least two bulbs would be lit when the brake petal is pressed.\n\nYou need to consider how to kill the lights when the turn signal is turned off. This could probably be done by adding three additional transistors to ground the timing capacitors of each 555 when the turn signal is turned off.\n\nBear in mind that the Arduinos in those kits are clones at best, and counterfeit’s at worst. What’s the difference? Well, a clone is one that could be identical in every way to a real Arduino, but is branded differently “SunDuino,” with that brand’s own logos, styling, etc. A counterfeit, on the other hand, seeks to make its product look as close to the official Arduino (i.e. color, branding, logos, screen printing, color of parts on board, etc) as possible — to confuse the buyer and make their product seem more legit.\n\nThat said, whichever you choose is between you and your conscience. Honestly, the quality is going to be nearly identical between that of a clone or otherwise; usually — not always. Pay attention to reviews and such is my best advice. SainSmart, DFRobot, and SeeedStudio are all good sellers of clones.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind about these Arduinos: they typically use the CH340 USB chipset for the virtual serial link. This is a well supported chipset, but its something to consider.\n\nAn official Arduino uses a secondary ATMega16U2 microcontroller for USB communications. Prior to that, they used the FTDI chipset for USB serial comms. Chinese clones continued to use the FTDI chipset even after the Arduino switched to the 16U2, likely because it was cheaper. FTDI then released a driver update (or something like that) that bricked unlicensed versions of the chip, and caused a lot of grief. That basically is what caused the Chinese clones to switch to the CH340 chipset (plus, it was much cheaper).\n\nAs far as everything else in the kits, quality varies, but for the most part, its fairly consistent — again, check reviews.\n\nThe biggest problem with these kits will typically be a lack of any kind of instructions, project ideas, or any kind of datasheets on the components. Most of the time, these kits are meant for those who are very self-sufficient in hardware and software. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a CD or a URL of PDFs and software, but I would caution against doing anything with it, particularly if you are using a Windows box, as such CDs and software have been known to be vectors for malware.\n\nFinally, as you have probably noticed, there are sellers out there offering some seemingly “weird” kits or microcontrollers, which you may wonder what the use of them is for.\n\nMost of the time, these controllers are meant to serve as platforms either for hacking, cloning, or counterfeiting well known tools based upon the same controllers (either current or older versions). For instance, there are plenty of clones and “bare” development boards which can be configured to act as a Saleae logic analyzer. Others are meant for other similar products, and some are meant just for experimentation (there’s an interesting set of microcontrollers out there based around a hopped-up 80C51 clone). Oh, and some are meant for experimentation creating flight controllers for quad-copters, too.\n\nLastly, you may have noticed some of the “rival” ARM-based SOC boards rivaling the Raspberry Pi (such ase the Orange Pi and the Banana Pi, among others). These can be extremely cheap and very powerful alternatives to the Raspberry Pi or Beagle, but keep in mind that they tend to be very community supported in that while they are alternatives, they are typically more popular with hardware hackers in China, so the english-speaking community is likely smaller, and support isn’t as good; plus drivers and such for the boards can be hit-or-miss.\n\nBasically, what I’m saying here is that if you want something closer to plug-n-play, stick with the official Raspberry Pi. But if you want to go out on a limb, these alternatives can offer an interesting reprieve — if you’re willing to dedicate more time.\n\nThe use of analog versus digital to me is a personal choice. I work in the 2-way radio field and personally prefer analog meters for several reasons; the first is that it is easier to detect a peak or a null with a needle on a meter than it is trying to read changing numbers on a digital display. In fact, I have never seen a grid dip oscillator with a digital display.\n\nThe second reason is that while working on a circuit board and looking for voltages, I can glance up at an analog meter and watch the needle move, and with the proper range set, I have a good idea what the voltage is with just a glance. With some analog meters such as the B&K 290 electronic VTVM that I use on the bench, there is a scale on the bottom with zero centered mid-span which allows me to see if a voltage/current varies from what I have set as the standard I am using, which allows me to set voltage/current to that standard.\n\nWhile I am an ‘analog guy’ there are times when I use a digital meter. When setting VCO voltages you need a digital meter to accurately set the voltages. Another use where digital is better (in my opinion) is reading the values of resistors and capacitors. A DMM has the advantage of reading capacitors, which analog can’t do. Although, it can be a pain to read resistors on an analog meter due to the logarithmic scale and crowding at the high end of the scale, it does excel at testing pots to see if the operation is smooth by watching the needle.\n\nOn my bench I have the B&K 290 analog electronic VTVM, a NLS TT-21 digital meter and for field work a Triplett model 60 VOM. What works for me or someone else may not necessarily work for you. As I said, it’s based on what you prefer and what your requirements are. I would suggest seeing if you can borrow a digital and analog meter, use them and see what works best for you.\n\nI will offer this suggestion if you do go the analog route, go for a meter that has 20K ohms/volt or better, the higher the ohms/volt the better as it will not load down a circuit under test as a lower range would.\n\nSo let’s say you are motoring about the countryside one fine day and you spot an interesting tower structure. Look around the entrance area and you should see a sign with the FCC Tower Identification Number on it. Let’s use number 1027514 as an example. Go onto www.fcc.gov/ and:\n\nClick the Licensing and Databases tab. You’ll be presented with a list of about 25 databases listed by their acronyms. Some of them are intuitive. Others, not so much.\n\nIn this case, Click on ASR (for Antenna Structure Registration). Partway down the page you’ll find Search with a choice of either Registrations or Applications.\n\nClick on Registrations and a new window opens. In the upper left corner is a field you enter the registration number. While you’re here, you can check out the other possible searches such as lat/lon, by state, etc.\n\nEnter the registration number and hit Submit. Note that this takes a whole lot longer to describe than to actually do it. A new window opens with the results, typically one line, but a fact-filled line. We now know the FCC File Number, the owner (in this case, WLAJ-TV), lat/lon, city and tower height in meters (307 meters or a little over 1000 feet). By the way, you can also get here by going to www.fccinfo.com/ where the good folks at Cavell, Mertz and Associates have an easy-to-use database front end and a nifty Google Earth plug-in that will give you the callsign for a station associated with a broadcast tower. Note - broadcast, not cell, two-way or other utility tower.\n\nOn the ASR Results page, click on the Registration Number. A new window opens, chock full of good information.\n\nAnother way to go about this is on the FCC home page, click on ‘browse by Bureaus & Offices’ then on the Media sub-tab. The Media home page will appear. Now, along the left side you will be presented with a list of choices. You want CDBS Search. You’ll then be presented with another list of choices which should be fairly self-explanatory. As an example, choose the first selection which is Search for Station Information (as of the date I’m doing this). The new window is a whole bunch of search fields but to keep it simple the first line is Call Sign. In that field, enter the call letters. Pick your station of interest and type it in there. Example - WLW and hit the Submit Station Search button. A new window opens with the results, which are fairly skimpy at this point. But on the far right of the results is a link labeled Click for Details. Another results window opens with more links to more information. But now we can get into the good stuff.\n\nOn the Bureaus & Offices / Media home page, select Electronic Filing and Databases along the left side. The new page that opens offers another list of choices, one of which is AM Query, among others. Hit that one and a new query search opens. On the first line enter WLW. Further down, just above the Results buttons you choose how much information you want. Choose the AM Query (detailed output + CDBS Links) menu item and hit either the Results To This Page/Tab or the Results To Next Page/Tab buttons, depending on your preference. You’ll get everything you ever wanted and more. If you’ve got the time, you can easily spend hours looking up all kinds of arcane things.\n\nThere is a wide assortment of voltage regulators available today, both linear and switching styles. The switching regulators are generally more efficient, but the question is about a linear regulator so I will stay with that.\n\nThree concerns are brought into this question: reliability, efficiency, and accuracy. And it appears that this is going to be used with a battery.\n\nFirst, a battery, by itself, is a fairly well regulated source. But there are two problems that are generally of concern with using a battery by itself. First, it may be hard to get a battery voltage that is what the circuit needs. For instance, if you are using 5V logic chips, then you are not going to find a 5V battery.\n\nSecond, the battery voltage will decrease with use: it will run down. This may not be desirable. But many logic circuits as well as many linear ones can run very nicely on bare battery power. CMOS logic chips can use supplies over a wide voltage range, so a 6 or 9V battery can be a good choice.\n\nIf you don’t really need a constant voltage over the life of the battery, a series resistor or diode can drop a fixed amount of voltage to bring the battery voltage down to the level needed by the load. But that voltage to the load will change as the battery runs down.\n\nFigure 1\n\nLinear regulators are of two general types, series and shunt. The series, linear regulator uses a series resistance that is controlled in a manner so that it drops the excess voltage from the voltage source, leaving only the amount desired for the load. The shunt regulator has a fixed, series resistance and diverts or shunts enough current to ground to bring the load voltage down to the desired value.\n\nFigure 2\n\nAnother thing that must be considered when discussing efficiency is the amount of current that the regulator circuit itself needs for it’s operation. So, for instance, the series regulator circuit actually looks more like this.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAssuming that a regulator is needed and sticking to linear types, there are several choices, including the zener diode and IC types mentioned in the question. A zener regulator is a very simple form of voltage regulator. The circuit looks like this:\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe theory is simple, the voltage drop across a zener diode will be constant so the series resistor drops the remainder of the supply voltage and allows the amount of current needed for that condition. The thing to notice here is that the voltage drop across the series resistor is approximately constant if the supply (battery) voltage is constant. So, according to Ohms law, the current through the series resistor is also constant. That current is the total current in the circuit and it is divided between the load and the zener diode.\n\nThe design of a zener regulator works like this:\n\nFind the MAXIMUM load current that will be needed. It is important to find the maximum value, because if the current ever exceeds this value, the zener regulator will drop out of regulation and the voltage across the load will be lower than the design value. This is IL.\n\nFrom the data sheet for the zener diode, find the quiescent or lowest operating value of current that is needed for the diode to operate at the zener voltage. This is Iz.\n\nAdd IL and Iz together to get the total operating current. I = IL + Iz\n\nRs must drop the difference between the battery voltage and the desired load voltage. Vs = Vb - VL. And, again using Ohms law, Rs = Vs / I\n\nThe zener voltage of the diode is just the desired load voltage. You are probably going to have to do some rounding.\n\nYou must calculate the worst case power consumption in both the series resistor and in the zener diode. For the series resistor this is simply Pr = Vs x I.\n\nFor the zener diode it is when zero load current is being drawn so: Pz = Vz * I.\n\nIt is good practice to multiple the power values by a safety factor. A 1.5X to 2X figure is generally used. The accuracy of a zener regulator can be seen on the zener’s data sheet. Look for a graph that shows the zener voltage plotted against the current. I would not be surprised by differences up to 10%, or even more. This is in addition to the tolerance value assigned to the zener diode.\n\nA zener regulator will be as dependable as the two components used: the series resistor and the zener diode. The reliability of these will both be heavily dependent on the amount of heat generated in them. This will, in turn, depend on the safety factor I mentioned in step 8 above and also on the proper cooling of these components. A heat sink is highly desirable if the current, I is large. An IC, series regulator has a circuit something like this.\n\nFigure 5\n\nThe design is very simple. The IC is connected in series with the power line and to the ground reference. In some cases where a different output voltage is needed, a resistor network can be connected between the IC’s output, ground, and the reference (bottom) terminal on the IC. The values of the capacitors are given on the data sheet. In the case of a battery supply, C1 can generally be omitted and a good value for C2 is often 0.1uF. Rs is an optional, series resistor that can be sized to drop part of the battery voltage when the load voltage is a lot smaller than the battery voltage. This decreases the amount of power that must be dissipated in the IC and therefore increases reliability. Again, calculations of the worst case power dissipation in both the IC and the optional Rs is needed.\n\nIf Rs = 0, then Pic = I x (Vb-VL). This calculated power must be less than the rated value of the IC package. Keep in mind that different IC packages may/will have different power ratings. Adding Rs is one way of keeping the power dissipated in the IC within this limit. If Rs is used (not zero Ohms) then the power calculations get more complicated. The value of Rs will be chosen for the maximum current situation and that will be where it’s power dissipation will be the most. Pic should also be at a maximum at that maximum current point, but I would check it at the minimum current and also around the half way point, just to be sure.\n\nThe efficiency of any linear IC regulator will be better than that of a zener regulator unless the zener is always operating with a maximum load current. When the load current decreases below it’s maximum value a zener will simply draw more current and keep the total power that is dissipated at a constant value. The IC regulator will draw a varying total current that changes as the output/load current changes. Therefore it is generally a lot more efficient.\n\nAs for life or dependability, IC regulators are generally as dependable as any other semiconductor based component. Since the current passes through them, they may be a bit more susceptible to surges than a Zener style regulator because transistors will fail faster than resistors. But if they are properly designed and installed with proper heat sinks, they can last for many decades. I would not hesitate to use an IC regulator in this application. If you want even higher efficiency, a switching regulator can probably provide that. Reliability may be somewhat lower, but not a lot.\n\nAccuracy of IC regulators, both linear and switching, is generally excellent. They all use feedback techniques where the output is sampled to provide the correction signal to the series element which controls the output voltage. The degree of accuracy can vary with the internal circuit details, but numbers like 3%, down to 1% or even better are common. Again, as with the zener, the rated accuracy and the accuracy variation with circuit conditions are separate values so an IC regulator with a rated accuracy of 5% may be capable of holding the output value to within 1% or even better.\n\nThe LM317 that you mention is an adjustable regulator design. It requires that you use additional resistors to bias the reference pin for the output/load voltage you want. This can be an advantage if an odd voltage is needed but you can also get similar, three terminal regulators that have fixed output/load voltages and do not require those external resistors. Look at the 78xx series for positive regulators or the 79xx series for negative voltage ones."
