        "text": "Regional Mexican radio station in Evanston, Illinois\n\nFor the basketball coach, see Steve Wojciechowski.\n\nFor other uses, see Wojo (disambiguation).\n\nWOJO (105.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Regional Mexican format. Licensed to Evanston, Illinois, United States, the station serves the Chicago area. The station is currently owned by TelevisaUnivision, via its division Uforia Audio Network through licensee Tichenor License Corporation.[4][5]\n\nWOJO's studios are located at 541 N. Fairbanks Ct, Suite 1100, Chicago, and its transmitter is located atop the John Hancock Center.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWEAW\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station began broadcasting in February 1947, and held the call sign WEAW.[1][6] The station was owned by North Shore Broadcasting, and its call sign stood for its president Edward A. Wheeler.[1][6][2][7]\n\nThe station broadcast at 104.3 MHz briefly in 1947, before moving to 96.7 MHz later that year.[2] The station's transmitter was located in Evanston and it had an ERP of 665 watts.[2] In 1948, the station's frequency was changed to 105.1 MHz and its ERP was increased to 36,000 watts at a HAAT of 240 feet.[2][1] The call sign officially became WEAW-FM in 1953 when a companion AM station was launched.[2] In 1961, the station's ERP was increased to 180,000 watts.[2] In 1970, the station's transmitter was moved to the top of the new John Hancock Center in Chicago, with its ERP reduced to 6,000 watts.[2]\n\nAmong the music heard on WEAW was light music, easy listening, classical music, and show tunes.[8][9][10][11][12][13] The station also carried programs from local schools, community organizations, and Northwestern University.[7] The station also broadcast background music to stores and other businesses, with ads removed for subscribers.[7][8][14][15] By 1964, all of its subscription services had been moved to subcarriers.[16]\n\nFrom 1947 through the 1960s, WEAW broadcast Northwestern Wildcats football games.[17] It was also the flagship station of the Chicago White Sox radio network in 1971 and 1972.[18]\n\nWOJO\n\n[edit]\n\nBy late 1972, most of the station's programming was in Spanish, and in December 1972, its callsign was changed to WOJO.[2][7]\n\nIn 1986, WOJO was sold to Tichenor Media for $1.4 million.[19][20] In 1997, Tichenor Media merged with Heftel Broadcasting to form the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, which merged with Univision Communications in 2004.[21]\n\nTranslators\n\n[edit]\n\nBroadcast translators for WOJO-HD2 Call sign Frequency City of license FID ERP (W) Class Transmitter coordinates FCC info W236CF 95.1 FM Chicago, Illinois 140658 60 D LMS W236CG 95.1 FM Bolingbrook, Illinois 140691 250 D LMS W280EM 103.9 FM Chicago, Illinois 140763 17 D LMS\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
