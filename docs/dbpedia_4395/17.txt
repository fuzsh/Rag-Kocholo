History

In a deal announced in February 1997, Root Communications Ltd. announced plans to buy eight radio stations owned by Florence, South Carolina-based Atlantic Broadcasting, including WGSS.[3] Qantum Communications Inc. purchased Florence's Root Communications Group LP stations in 2003.[4]

WGSS was "94.1 The Light", an urban gospel station, prior to 2009.

At one time, WRZE simulcast WDAR-FM and played adult contemporary music.[5]

In 2012, Sunny 94.1 was flipped to mainstream urban "Swagga". It was also simulcast on WWRK.[6] Later WWRK moved from 1400 to 970 AM.[7][8]

On May 15, 2014, Qantum Communications announced that it would sell its 29 stations, including WRZE, to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), in a transaction connected to Clear Channel's sale of WALK AM-FM in Patchogue, New York to Connoisseur Media via Qantum.[9] The transaction was consummated on September 9, 2014.

In August 2017, WRZE, WWRK and the translators began simulcasting WDAR-FM, which took over the urban contemporary format.[10]

On September 14, 2017 WRZE, WWRK and the translators dropped the urban simulcast with WDAR-FM and switched to classic rock, branded as "Rock 94.1 - 97.9 - 105.9". The station airs the syndicated "Rover's Morning Glory".[11]
