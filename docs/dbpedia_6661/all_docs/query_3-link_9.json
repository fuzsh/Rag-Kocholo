Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nGeorge's ancestors now head Europe's royal families, as his children and grandchildren married royals from around the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that royals in Britain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Spain, and Monaco are all distantly related to each other.\n\nHere is an interactive family tree of Europe's royal families. Each generation is represented by a small circle, each color represents a different family, a solid line represents a blood relation, and a broken line shows a marriage.\n\nHover over the royals' names for a better description of them.\n\nThe UK's young royals, including Prince William and Kate Middleton to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, all fit into the picture too, as the descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and their spouses.\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
