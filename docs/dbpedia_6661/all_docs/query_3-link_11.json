        "text": "From Queen Bey to Queen Elizabeth, royalty can bless a person via family bloodline, or via social status.\n\nWhile many celebrities seem to already feel as if they have royalty status, it’s hard to believe how many famous faces could become even more influential.\n\nBy discovering their direct blood lines to royal figures and monarchs, it’s safe to say that celebrity blood lines can be just as imperial as their careers.\n\nCelebrities Who Are Descendants Of Royalty\n\nFrom Hilary Duff to Brad Pitt, keep scrolling to learn which celebrities are not only Hollywood royalty, but actual royalty too.\n\nDakota and Elle Fanning\n\nWhile most of us recognise Elle Fanning from her latest T.V. series, playing Catherine in The Great, it seems that she and older sister Dakota have royal blood after all. As 22nd great-granddaughters of King Edward III, their blood line also connects them to Kate Middleton’s mother, Carole Goldsmith, who is the distant granddaughter of King Edward III.\n\nWhich means that the actor-slash-siblings are, not only the 21st cousins to the Duchess of Cambridge, but the coolest sisters in Hollywood.\n\nRose Leslie\n\nIn vast contrast to Ygritte, her character on hit-series Game Of Thrones, Leslie is in fact royal by blood. And not through her marriage to co-star Kit Harington, either.\n\nLeslie’s father is a chieftain of the Aberdeernshire clan Leslie, while her mother is a descendant of King Charles II.\n\nFor an extra GoT-themed twist, it looks as if she and Harington are both descendants to King Charles II, making them very distant cousins.\n\nBeyoncé Knowles-Carter\n\nShe may be the queen of the music industry, but it seems that Beyoncé may be more royal than we think. As the 25th cousin, once removed, of Queen Elizabeth II, her cultural title of ‘Queen Bey’ makes complete sense now.\n\nHilary Duff\n\nThe original Disney Princess is an 18th cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHilary Duff\n\nHilary Duff, besides being the original Disney princess, is said to be the most closely related American celebrity to the Queen herself.\n\nThe Lizzie McGuire star is her majesty’s 18th cousin, through Alexander Spotswood, who was the 10th great-grandson of Edward III. This what dreams are made of, literally.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nHollywood’s funny lady happens to be the 15th cousin of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge. Apparently Ellen is also directly descended from King Edward III who reigned in 1327.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nComedian, talk-show host and philanthropist, Ellen DeGeneres, happens to be the 15th cousin of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge. Apparently, she is also a direct descendent from King Edward III who reigned in 1327.\n\nDeGeneres even claimed her royal blood as a way to bond with one of the smallest royals, Prince George. In an interview, DeGeneres even joked about it, saying: “I saw that picture of Prince George in his robe with President Obama and I’m like, ‘I have a clothing line [ED by Ellen]; I can give him clothes; I can make a special robe for him!'”\n\nUma Thurman\n\nWhile she’s definitely Kill Bill royalty in our eyes, Uma Thurman is also carries a royal blood line. Thurman is the 21st cousin, once removed, to Queen Elizabeth thanks to her ancestor, King Edward I of England. Could she get any cooler?\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nDoes this one really surprise you? On Angelina’s mother’s side, it’s believed she is connected to the first King of France, Phillip II, who ruled from 1180 to 1223.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nElegant and regal in every red carpet appearance, Angelina Jolie’s royal connection is hardly a surprise.\n\nIt seems as if Jolie is related to French royalty through her mother, Marie Betrand, by her connection to the first King of France, Phillip II, who ruled from 1180 to 1223.\n\nTo sweeten the deal, Jolie and Queen Elizabeth II are 26th cousins.\n\nJake and Maggie Gyllenhaal\n\nThese ridiculously good-looking siblings through their father’s side are distant relatives of King Edward III and are also 19th cousins to the current queen of England, Elizabeth II.\n\nJake and Maggie Gyllenhaal\n\nHollywood’s favourite siblings may typically refrain from the spotlight, but their family history is certainly far from under-the-radar.\n\nThe siblings are distant relatives of King Edward III and are also 19th cousins to the late queen of England, Elizabeth II.\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nBrad and Angelina really were the King and Queen of Hollywood. Turns out Brad is connected to King Henry II through his mother.\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nHandsome, talented and royal? Pitt might be one of Hollywood’s leading men, but he’s also connected to King Henry II through his mother’s family tree. Which makes him the Queen’s 25th cousin, twice removed.\n\nBrooke Shields\n\nThe original Queen of the bold brow is distant relative of France’s King Henry IV and is also connected to Catherine de Medici and Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter of Pope Alexander VI.\n\nBrooke Shields\n\nIt looks as if Brooke Shields is next in line for America’s most-royal celebrity, after Hilary Duff. The original queen of the bold brow is distant relatives with France’s King Henry II, which makes her Queen Elizabeth’s 18th cousin, once removed.\n\nShields is also connected to Catherine de Medici and Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter of Pope Alexander VI.\n\nParis Hilton\n\nParis never ceases to amaze us. Your ’00s Queen happens to be the 20th cousin of Queen Elizabeth II through her dad Rick’s side of the family.\n\nParis Hilton\n\nParis Hilton never ceases to amaze us. The Simple Life star is not only the queen of the early ’00s but also happens to be the 20th cousin of Queen Elizabeth II through her dad, Rick Hilton’s side of the family.\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry\n\nAs Prince William and Prince Harry are famous for their royal family, their lineage goes even further back than we thought. Prince Philip, their grandfather, is connected to Russian royalty through his paternal grandmother, Olga Constantinovna of Russia, the granddaughter of Nicholas I.\n\nWhich means that their grandfather is the great-great-grandson of Nicholas I, the Emporor of Russia from 1825 to 1855.\n\nAnd as if it couldn’t get any better, Nicholas I was the son of Paul I, who was the son of Catherine the Great. Yes, the Catherine The Great that Elle Fanning plays in the eponymous series.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nHollywood royalty and actual royalty. Tom Hanks through his father’s side is a descendant of King John of England, who reigned from 1199 to 1216.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nHanks may be Hollywood’s most humble actor but he is also actual royalty. The Forrest Gump star, through his father’s side, is a descendant of King John of England, who reigned from 1199 to 1216. Which makes him 24th cousin to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nHugh Grant\n\nThis charming Brit happens to be a distant ancestor of Henry VII. We always knew there was something ~special~ about him.\n\nHugh Grant\n\nBritish heartthrob, Hugh Grant, is not only ’90s rom-com royalty, but apparently he’s actual royalty too. As Queen Elizabeth’s ninth cousin, Grant happens to be a distant ancestor of Henry VII of England and King James IV of Scotland.\n\nWe always knew there was something ~special~ about him.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nDuring an episode of Who Do You Think You Are Johnny discovered that he is a 20th cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nAn actor and musician, Depp looks to be adding ‘royal’ to his list of accomplishments. During an episode of Who Do You Think You Are, Depp discovered that he is a 20th cousin to Queen Elizabeth II, due to his lineage to Edward III."
