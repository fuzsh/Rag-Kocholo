        "text": "Charles Alexander Cambridge (Chuck/Chucky) was born on June 2, 1980, in the Bronx, NY (BX baby!!). He grew up on Long Island in Hempstead. He attended Jackson Main (Elementary), Bethesda SDA (Middle), and South Shore Christian School, where he graduated with his High School Diploma.\n\nHe attended Pfeiffer University in Meisenheimer, NC. Even though his brother Maurice was there, Chuck forged his own path and had many adventures of his own (some that are too much to print). He graduated from Pfeiffer with his Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice in May 2003. He had a career working with children, which is not surprising because the kids loved Chucky. Chuck was a lifelong Jets fan, and even though they never won a Super Bowl during his lifetime, he continued to support them. However, he occasionally did root for the Philadelphia Eagles (something about green teams). Chuck was very passionate about life, loved a good adventure and had a heart of gold for his family and friends. He would give you the shirt off his back (although it would be too small for you), but his kindness was behind it. Chuck was an avid fan of animated series, his favorites being Futurama and The Simpsons. He also loved watching movies and would not hesitate to give you his recommendations. Most of the time, they were horrible choices, but he wanted you to enjoy what he enjoyed.\n\nChuck is survived by his son Alexander William Robert Cambridge and partner of 15 years, Vulnavia M. Scales; his older brothers, Sultan and wife Karlon, Maurice and his wife Cari; and his Aunt Beatrice Crowder. His eight nieces and nephews also survive him; Alex, Micheala, Christian, Meghan, Theodore, Franklin, Charlotte and Oâ€™Dell; they all used him as a jungle gym when visiting Uncle Chucky.\n\nThe kindest man we've ever known, the strongest man we've ever met."
