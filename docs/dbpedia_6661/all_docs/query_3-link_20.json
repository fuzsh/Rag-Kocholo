        "text": "As I type this on Wednesday, July 24, 2013 the name of the new royal prince has been announced. his name and title are…His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge. Here are my thoughts. First of all I am very happy with the names! They are all very royal and traditional names. His first name, George, was after the Queens father, George VI, and the name Alexander is the masculine form of Alexandra, one of the middle names of Queen Elizabeth II. Louis is for Lord Louis Mountbatten (born HSH Prince Louis of Battenberg) uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. I would have been happy if the prince had been named Alexander for that was one of my guesses. I like that the continued to honor Lord Mountbatten by giving him the name Louis.\n\nI am happy and also relived that they did select a very traditional name. I know the Duke of Cambridge likes to be more independent and may not always want to adhere to tradition so I have to be honest and say that I was a bit worried that they would really go in a different direction. But George was the name I was rooting for and I am happy it was chosen. God willing in the due corse of time, he will become HM King George VII of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. But as I said before probably will not happen for 50-60 years in time.\n\nThere was another Prince George of Cambridge, who later also became the Duke of Cambridge, and I will write about him nest week. That Prince George of Cambridge was a grandson of King George III and a first cousin to Queen Victoria. His father was HRH Prince Adolphus Frederick, 1774-1850, was the tenth child and seventh son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. The new Prince George of Cambridge is a direct descendant of Prince Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Cambridge.\n\nAdolphus Frederick was married to Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel and had three children. George, Augusta and Mary Adelaide. I will speak more about George in his own blog post. His sister Augusta married Friedrich-Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The youngest child, Mary Adelaide, married Prince (later Duke) Franz of Teck, a morganatic scion of the Wurttemberg royal family. Mary Adelaide and Franz had a daughter, Princess Mary of Teck who married the future King George V of the United Kingdom. Their son was King George VI, father of Queen Elizabeth II, who is the great-grand mother of the new Prince George of Cambridge.\n\nAs of Today, here is the line of succession to the British throne:"
