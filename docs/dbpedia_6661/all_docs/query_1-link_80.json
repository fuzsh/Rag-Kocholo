        "text": "Prince George of Cambridge (George Alexander Louis; born 22 July 2013) is the only child of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, as well as the only grandchild of Charles, Prince of Wales. He is third in line to succeed his great-grandmother, Elizabeth II, to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms, following his grandfather and father.\n\nOn 3 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that the Duchess was expecting the couple's first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is traditional as she had been admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness.\n\nSt Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, where Prince George was born like his father the Duke of Cambridge in 1982.\n\n22 July 2013 - present: His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - Buckingham Palace announced on 22 July 2013 that the Prince's territorial designation would be \"Cambridge\". This follows the precedent of having a newborn prince's title containing the same location as his father's title, as was the case for his father who was named Prince William of Wales (son of Charles, Prince of Wales) prior to being granted the title Duke of Cambridge in 2011."
