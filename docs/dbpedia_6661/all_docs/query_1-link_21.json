He was the third son and fourth child of Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His mother was a granddaughter of King George III and cousin to Queen Victoria. He was the son of a prince of Teck in Württemberg. Family and friends called him Alge, using the first two letters of Alexander and George.\n\nDue to high debts, his parents left the United Kingdom for two years, fleeing to continental Europe. Nine-year-old Prince Alexander remained at Eton College before moving on to the Royal Military College in Sandhurst. He completed his officer's training in October 1894 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 7th Queen's Own Hussars. Soon after, he served in the Second Matabele War. He was mentioned in dispatches during the conflict and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. In June 1899, he was promoted to lieutenant and by the following April became captain. For his actions in the Second Boer War, he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order in April 1901. He continued to rise in the military ranks while serving in the African campaigns of the First World War, receiving numerous honours and decorations.\n\nin 1904 he married Princess Alice of Albany, the daughter of Queen Victoria’s youngest son; they had three children.\n\nAthlone was Governor General of the Union of South Africa from 1924 to 1930. After his return to Britain, he was made Governor and Constable of Windsor Castle and chancellor of the University of London.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Athlone served as Governor General of Canada. He hosted the Québec Conferences in 1943 and 1944, where Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt met to discuss Allied strategy. The vice regal couple made many trips across Canada, encouraging the war effort.\n\nAfter returning to Britain, Athlone continued as chancellor of the University of London until 1955. He died in 1957 at Kensington Palace.\n\nTitles: H.S.H.
