        "text": "It is generally believed that Black students first studied at Cambridge University in England in the early 1700s. But the first documented record of a Black student is from 1848. That year, Alexander Crummell enrolled at Cambridge to study moral philosophy.\n\nCrummellâ€™s father was a slave in the United States but Alexander Crummell was born free and attended an abolitionist school in New York City. Later, he was ordained as an Episcopal minister and went to Britain to raise money for his church and to seek support for the abolitionist movement in the United States. When supporters secured him a place at Cambridge and offered to pay his tuition, Crummell decided to stay in Britain to pursue higher education.\n\nLatest News\n\nFAMU Interim President Calls for Immediate Resignation of Entire Senior Administrative Team\n\n\"After careful considerationI h, ave concluded that a change in our senior leadership team is necessary to move forward more effectively,\" wrote Interim President Tim Bear in a letter to all 19 senior administrators at FAMU.\n\nFive African Americans Selected for Leadership Positions at Alcorn State University\n\nMarcus Ward, Edward Rice, Karen Shedrick, Lucreta Tribune, and Maxine Greenleaf have all been selected to serve in key administrative leadership positions at historically Black Alcorn State University in Mississippi.\n\nUNCF and Six Partner Institutions Establish Digital Learning Community for HBCUs\n\nHBCUv, a new online learning platform for HBCU students, faculty, and staff, is designed to mirror the authentic, culturally affirming, and supportive environments found on HBCU campuses.\n\nNAACP Awards Prestigious Spingarn Medal to Henry Louis Gates, Jr.\n\nThe NAACP's Springarn Medal is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious prizes recognizing outstanding achievements by Black Americans.
