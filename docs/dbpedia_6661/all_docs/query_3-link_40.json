        "text": "Alexander I (born April 5, 1857, Verona, Venice [Italy]—died Nov. 17, 1893, Graz, Austria) was the first prince of modern autonomous Bulgaria.\n\nThe son of Prince Alexander of Hesse (previously created prince of Battenberg upon his morganatic marriage) and a favourite nephew of Alexander II of Russia, Alexander served during 1877 with the Russian forces in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), which resulted in the autonomy of Bulgaria. In accordance with the provisions of the Congress of Berlin (1878), Alexander was elected constitutional prince of the newly autonomous Bulgarian state on April 29, 1879, but he had to deal with a strong Russian interference in domestic affairs. Saddled with what he regarded as an absurd liberal constitution, however, he set himself to undermining the state’s constitutional bases, first dissolving the national assembly (1880) and then suspending the constitution and assuming for himself plenary powers (1881). With the deterioration of his relations with Russia after the accession of Alexander III, however, he restored the constitution (1883) and accepted a new liberal–conservative coalition government to combat Russian influence."
