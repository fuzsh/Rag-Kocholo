and lends his voice to Mr Wolf and Captain Dog in Peppa Pig.\n\nAlexander Armstrong wife: Is he related to royalty or Lord Armstrong?\n\nAlexander, or Zander to his friends, is not related to the Royal family.\n\nHowever, his rich family background was documented in an episode of BBC One’s Who Do You Think You Are?\n\nIn 2010, Alexander discovered that he was a descendant of William the Conqueror.\n\nHe is also distantly related to William Armstrong, founder of Cragside and whose family still own Bamburgh Castle.\n\nAlexander Armstrong comes from a North East landowning family distantly related to The 1st Baron Armstrong.\n\nHow old is Alexander Armstrong and where was he born?\n\nAlexander Henry Fenwick Armstrong was born on March 2 1970 in Rothbury, Northumberland.\n\nHe is currently 52 years old.\n\nAlexander is the youngest of three children and grew up in the family home near Rothbury in Northumberland.\n\nHis father worked as a GP and his mother as a magistrate.\n\nAfter graduating from Cambridge University in 1992, he moved to London with friends to pursue a career in acting and comedy.\n\nWho is his wife?\n\nThe wife of Alexander Armstrong is Hannah Bronwen Snow.\n\nThe pair have been married since August 2003.\n\nIn July 2014, they moved to a 26-acre farm near Bledington in Oxfordshire with their four children.\n\nThe couple has four young sons – Rex (born 2007), Patrick (born 2009), Edward (born 2010), and Henry (born 2014).\n\nBefore having kids, Hannah worked as an events organiser.\n\nShe is also the sister of journalist and food blogger Esther Walker, who is married to restaurant critic Giles Coren.\n\nWhat is his net worth?\n\nThe television host has built a fortune of around £3.6million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nIn addition to his presenting roles, he also voices numerous animations and appeared in the infamous Pimms adverts.\n\nHe’s also written books, sung albums and hosted countless TV shows.\n\nAre Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman friends?\n\nAlexander Armstrong has known his former Pointless sidekick ever since he was 18.\n\nThe pair met at Cambridge University.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, Richard studied Politics and Sociology at Trinity College, where he was a contemporary of Alexander Armstrong, who read English.\n\nWhen Richard announced his departure from Pointless, he said in a statement: “Pointless has been a joy from start to finish, working alongside my friend Alexander Armstrong, backed by the most wonderful team, and for the best viewers in the world.\n\n“I will miss everyone so much, but I’m thrilled that I’ll still be presenting the celebrity shows.”\n\nIs he still friends with Ben Miller?\n\nAlexander Armstrong and Ben Miller formed a working relationship in 1997.\n\nThey appeared in their own sketch shows, radio programmes, and even launched their own production company named Toff Media, which is still active.\n\nBoth Alexander and Ben Miller were at Cambridge at the same time.\n\nThe pair met outside a World Party gig in Cambridge in 1990, and became firm friends.\n\nThey remain friends and, in 2018, Death in Paradise star Ben teased they were working on new material together.\n\nHow tall is Alexander Armstrong?\n\nAlexander Armstrong is 1.81 metres tall, which is 5 foot 9 inches.\n\nWhich is not quite as tall as his former Pointless co-star Richard Osman!\n\nRichard is a whopping 6 foot 7.\n\nAlexander Armstrong wife – South Korea on C5\n\nThe presenter embarks on a journey across South Korea.\n\nThe three-part travel series was due to air on Tuesday November 01 2022, but it was rescheduled due to the recent tragedy in the country.\n\nIn late October, at least 154 people died in a tragic Halloween crush in a popular nightlife district of the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\nMost of the victims were in their 20s and there were more women among the dead than men. Officials say there are 26 foreign nationals among the deceased.\n\nOut of respect, Channel 5 replaced the documentary in the schedules.\n\nIn a statement, they said: “Following the recent tragic events in South Korea, the decision was made to remove the programme Alexander Armstrong in South Korea from the Channel 5 schedules on Tuesday 1st November at 9pm.”\n\nIt will now start on Tuesday November 08 2022 at 9pm.\n\nRead more: Alexander Armstrong dropped two stone weight after he ‘couldn’t bear looking at himself’ on TV\n\nPointless airs every week night at 5.15pm on BBC One.
