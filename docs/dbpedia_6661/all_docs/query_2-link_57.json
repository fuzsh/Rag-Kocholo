        "text": "Alexander Anievas\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPh.D., Cambridge\n\nDr. Alexander Anievasâ research interests lie at the intersection of historical sociology, political economy and international relations. Dr. Anievas previously held fellowships at the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge before coming to UConn in 2016. He is the author ofÂ Capital, the State, and War: Class Conflict and Geopolitics in the Thirty Yearsâ Crisis, 1914-1945Â (University of Michigan Press, 2014), for which he was awarded the Sussex International Theory Book Prize, and co-author (with Kerem NiÅancÄ±oÄlu) ofÂ How the West Came to Rule: The Geopolitical Origins of CapitalismÂ (Pluto, 2015), winner of the ISAâs International Political Sociology Section Best Book Award and the BISA-IPE Working Group Book Prize.\n\nDr. Anievas is currently completing the manuscript Race to Rollback: Far-Right Power in Americaâs Global Cold War for Columbia University Press. Through a theoretically-informed empirical analysis of American Cold War (geo)politics, Race to Rollback demonstrates how the far-right contributed to the formation of a racialized anticommunist political order at home crucial to projecting US imperial interests abroad. The manuscript offers a reconceptualization of US hegemony that problematizes existing accounts of the Cold War, while demonstrating the structural interconnections between the far-right and the so-called US-led liberal order-building project. In addition, Dr. Anievas is working on a related co-authored manuscript (with Richard Saull) provisionally entitled Legacies of Fascism: Race and the Far-Right in the Making of the Cold War.\n\nResearch Interests:Â History and Theory of International Relations; Historical Sociology; Marxism and Critical Theory; International Political Economy; Origins of the Two World Wars; Hegemony and World Order; War and Revolution; Origins of Capitalism and the Great Divergence; Race, Racism and the Far-Right in World Politics.\n\nEditorial and Organizing Work:Â He is a corresponding editor ofÂ Historical Materialism: Research in Critical Marxist Theory.Â He was a Managing Editor of theÂ Cambridge Review of International AffairsÂ between 2008 and 2010.
