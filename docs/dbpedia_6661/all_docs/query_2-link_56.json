        "text": "Overview\n\nAlexander Livingston is Associate Professor in the Department of Government and Interim Director of the Society for the Humanities. His primary areas of research are democratic theory, social movements, religion and politics, and the history of twentieth-century political thought. His areas of specialization include American and African American political thought.\n\nLivingston has published two books, most recently an edited volume on the dialogical approach to political theory developed by the Canadian political theorist James Tully and its contributions to the study of democracy, citizenship, and decolonization, James Tully: To Think and Act Differently (Routledge, 2022). His first book, Damn Great Empires! William James and the Politics of Pragmatism (Oxford University Press, 2016), examines pragmatist philosopher William James’s critique of knowledge and authority in the context of struggles against American overseas imperialism at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nHis current research program examines the history of nonviolence as strategy of contention, a practice of world-making, and a language of political thought. Projects in contribution to this larger program include a book manuscript on the sermons of Martin Luther King Jr. and his unexamined contributions as a theorist of power, as well as a new co-edited volume of the political writings of Mohandas K. Gandhi.\n\nIn addition to these monographs, Livingston's research has appeared in American Political Science Review, Political Theory, Journal of Politics, Perspectives on Politics, and Contemporary Political Theory, as well as numerous edited volumes including The Research Handbook on Liberalism, The Cambridge Companion to Civil Disobedience, Radikale Demokratietheorie: Ein Handbuch and A Political Companion to W.E.B. Du Bois. His public writing has appeared in Jacobin Magazine and Boston Review.\n\nBefore coming to Cornell, he was a Social Science and Humanities Research Council postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto.\n\nResearch Focus\n\nAmerican and African-American Political Thought\n\nDemocratic Theory\n\nCivil Disobedience\n\nSocial Movements\n\nReligion and Politics\n\nPublications\n\nBooks:\n\nJames Tully: To Think and Act Differently (London: Routledge, 2022)\n\nDamn Great Empires!
