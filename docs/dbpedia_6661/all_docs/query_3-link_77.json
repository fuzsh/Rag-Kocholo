        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs its name suggests, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a country led by a monarch—a king or queen. The current monarch is King Charles III. The British monarchy has a long history. England was formed during the early Middle Ages by the union of small Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Over the following centuries, the English kings conquered other kingdoms, bringing them under English rule. In 1536 Wales, a collection of Celtic kingdoms, was formally united with England. Scotland has been ruled by an English monarch since 1603. It was formally joined to England and Wales in 1707, to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Meanwhile, Ireland had come under English control in the 1600s. It was formally united with Great Britain in 1801. Although most of Ireland became a separate country in 1922, Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe early English kings were absolute monarchs, or rulers with total power over the kingdom. Over time, much of the English monarch’s power was transferred to Parliament. In 1215 King John was forced by English nobles to sign a document called the Magna Carta, which placed some limits on the king’s power. The English Bill of Rights of 1689 made the king responsible to Parliament and subject to the country’s laws. In 1701 the Act of Settlement further limited the role of the monarch.\n\nThe United Kingdom is now a constitutional monarchy, a country in which the monarch shares power with a constitutionally organized government. The prime minister serves as head of government. The monarch (King Charles III) is head of state. In practice, however, the monarch acts only on the advice of ministers and cannot reject or ignore their advice.\n\nBelow is a list of the kings and queens who have ruled England and then Great Britain and the United Kingdom through the centuries. The list is in chronological order, and the sections indicate the main ruling families or general groups. The dates given are the years that the king or queen reigned.\n\nStuarts (1603 to 1714)\n\nThe Tudor line ended when Elizabeth I died in 1603. The crown passed to her cousin James of the house of Stuart (or Stewart). At the time he was James VI, king of Scotland. He became James I of England, and from 1603 until 1707, the English monarch also ruled Scotland. In the Act of Union of 1707, England and Scotland joined together to become one country, Great Britain.\n\nIn the 1600s some people in England sought to limit the power of the king. This led to the English Civil Wars, which began in 1642. The supporters of the king (Charles I) fought the supporters of Parliament (led by Oliver Cromwell). In 1649 the king was executed, but the war continued until 1651. England then became a commonwealth and had no monarch for 11 years. Oliver Cromwell and his son Richard led the country from 1653 to 1659. They were called lord protectors of the commonwealth. The Stuart monarchy was restored to the throne in 1660.\n\nJames I (1603–25)\n\nCharles I (1625–49)\n\nCharles II (1660–85)\n\nJames II (1685–88)\n\nWilliam III and Mary II (1689–1702)\n\nAnne (1702–14)\n\nWindsors (1901 to present)\n\nWhen Queen Victoria died in 1901, the house of Hanover came to an end. She was succeeded by her son Edward VII. His dynasty was at first called the house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, for the family name of his father, who was Victoria’s German-born husband, Albert, the prince consort. When Edward died, his son became king as George V. During World War I, George V changed the family name to Windsor because Britain was fighting Germany, and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was a German name. It was decreed in 1917 that all English-born male descendants of Queen Victoria take the last name Windsor.\n\nIn December 1936 Edward VIII became the first British monarch to voluntarily resign the crown. He stepped down in order to marry Wallis Warfield Simpson of the United States. (As a woman twice divorced, she was considered socially and politically unacceptable as a prospective British queen.) Edward’s younger brother became king as George VI. His daughter Elizabeth II was queen from 1952 to 2022, making her the longest-reigning monarch in British history. Her son Charles III is the current British monarch.\n\nEdward VII (1901–10)\n\nGeorge V (1910–36)\n\nEdward VIII (1936)\n\nGeorge VI (1936–52)\n\nElizabeth II (1952–2022)\n\nCharles III (2022– )"
