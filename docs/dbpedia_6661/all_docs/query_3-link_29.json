        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II was the longest reigning monarch in British history, and she saw. some. things. Like, so many things that The Crown had to add on an entire extra season just to cover all the drama—and they're already talking about sequels! And while we're all pretty familiar with her late majesty's direct heirs to the British throne (hi, King Charles, Prince William, and Prince George), the royal line of succession stretches back tons of people, and it just keeps getting longer as everyone has more children.\n\nAnd yes, Princess Charlotte is high up on the list (as she should be!) thanks to that got rid of male primogeniture—a rule that stated male heirs took precedence over their female siblings, even if they were not born first. But keep in mind that any royal children born before 2013 are fresh out of luck (like Princess Anne and her family) and people marrying into the family (like the late Prince Philip) are also not included, so the line of succession can be a littttttle confusing. Which is where we come in. Here are all of the family members following in Queen Elizabeth's well-heeled shoes, just in case you're wondering what kind of chance your personal faves (hi, Prince Harry and Prince Louis) have at being King/Queen one day now that King Charles has been coronated (and subsequently, diagnosed with cancer, which means Wills might become King literally any day now)."
