        "text": "As Jordyn Cambridge and Brinae Alexander went through the recruiting process, most teams thought they were a package deal. Land one, and you’d get the other.\n\nAlexander, a senior wing on the Vanderbilt women’s basketball team, swears this isn’t the case. She and Cambridge had several offers in common, but they weren’t explicitly intending to both attend the same school. Alexander was leaning towards Kentucky and its No. 1-ranked pharmacy school in the nation.\n\nThen, Alexander got a call from Cambridge, a close friend and AAU teammate. She’d just committed to Vanderbilt. “Take that information and do what you want with it,” she said.\n\nAs Alexander began thoroughly weighing pros and cons, Vanderbilt made more and more sense. “Three or four days later,” she estimates, she committed too.\n\nNow, over four years later, Cambridge and Alexander are the senior leaders of a Commodores team that has undergone major upheaval. In their first season under coach Shea Ralph, the year after opting out of the season altogether, Vanderbilt is seeded No. 13 in the SEC Tournament at Bridgestone Arena. When the Commodores (13-17) play Wednesday against No. 12-seeded Texas A&M (14-14), they’ll be led by two longtime friends who call Middle Tennessee home.\n\nTOURNAMENT OPPONENT: Vanderbilt women's basketball is No. 13 seed, will face Texas A&M in SEC Tournament\n\nSENIOR NIGHT DUB: Vanderbilt women's basketball forces 28 turnovers, beats No. 21 Florida on Senior Night, 63-59\n\nLIFT EVERY VOICE: Why Vanderbilt women's basketball plays 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' before every home game\n\n'I'm going to Vanderbilt with you'\n\nCambridge and Alexander first met when they were in fourth grade, playing on an AAU team called Tennessee Pride. Though Cambridge was from Nashville and Alexander was from Murfreesboro, the two had sleepovers whenever they could. Whenever they traveled to tournaments, the pair and their moms traveled and stayed together and split the costs. Alexander remembers being so loud in the hotel room late at night that angry neighbors came to knock on their door. Cambridge recalls when she ran out of her room, screaming, as she sleepwalked.\n\nIn high school, Cambridge played for Ensworth, a private school in Nashville, while Alexander was at Riverdale, a public school in Murfreesboro. The two were in different divisions in high school, so each tried to come to one of the other’s games at least once a season. Both were named All-State three times, and both won state titles and were Tennessee Miss Basketball finalists.\n\n“It was around like sophomore year of high school, when we really figured out like, ‘OK, we're really gonna go DI, full scholarship,’ and I was gonna go to a Power Five school,” Alexander told The Tennessean. “Like, we’re actually that good. Because that's when the realization set in for me, I’m like, wow. I’m actually gonna go to school for free. And so that’s when we started to get really heavily recruited.”\n\nIn March 2017, after her junior season, Cambridge tore her right ACL playing AAU ball. It was a wake-up call for both women. They knew that for athletes who got injured before ever getting to campus, there was a possibility some of the schools could pull their offers. Unable to get back on the court because of the knee injury, Cambridge needed to make a quick decision.\n\nAlexander decided to follow Cambridge to Vanderbilt for several reasons. The academics were important to her, as was being close to home. She had good relationships with the all-female staff at the time. And with Cambridge already committed, she knew that if she went to Vanderbilt, she wouldn’t have to start from scratch socially.\n\nWhen Alexander committed, she called Cambridge immediately. “I’m going to Vanderbilt with you,” she said.\n\nCambridge, still recovering from ACL surgery, got out of her bed and hobbled down the hallway to find her mom. “Brinae,” she said, “tell her what you just told me.”\n\n“I was just jumping on my leg,” Cambridge said. The moms were happy too, already planning how they could do everything together.\n\nThe two then took their official visits together in October. Though athletes have the option to take multiple official visits, neither did. They saw the future for themselves as Commodores.\n\nLeaning on each other\n\nCambridge and Alexander didn’t have the experience at Vanderbilt that they planned. Even before they got to campus, one of the assistant coaches who had recruited them left. Staff turnover was constant.\n\nIn November 2019, Alexander tore her Achilles and missed the rest of the season. Afterwards, she felt depressed and closed herself off to others, the only time she remembers ever having a semblance of a conflict with Cambridge. In March 2020, in a season-ending SEC Tournament loss, Cambridge tore the ACL again. A week later, the NCAA Tournament was canceled due to COVID-19.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, everything fell apart. Alexander returned from the Achilles injury but decided to opt out of the remainder of the season before SEC play started. A few weeks later, the rest of the team — down to just seven available players — followed suit, canceling the rest of the season. It was just days before Cambridge was cleared to return. Half the roster transferred or left the team. In April, coach Stephanie White, who had recruited both players, was fired. When the pair learned that they would be getting a new coach, too, it was almost too much upheaval to handle. But they decided to stick it out one more season under Ralph. Get through this season, and they’d both have degrees and could still leave if they chose.\n\n“I was just like, 'Oh, my God, what am I gonna do?' ” Alexander said. “And I didn’t even know if I was gonna stay or not. But I was like, you know, I’ve only got one more year left. And I guess I just got to get this degree, why would I give that up? There just wouldn’t be, in my mind, it wouldn't have been a smart move.”\n\n'It's just us'\n\nAfter everything, Cambridge and Alexander were the only constants from when they started at Vanderbilt. The lone other senior, Asha Taylor, transferred from Dartmouth prior to 2021.\n\n“At one point, it was just like, ‘It’s just us,’ ” Cambridge said. “ &mldr; We are the only ones who really know everything that we’ve gone through. And we really had to lean on each other and make sure we stay up because we’re still standing. We’re still here, about to graduate in a few months.”\n\nAs seniors, the two were expected to step into more of a leadership role. It was a difficult transition, especially considering that neither truly had a lot of experience due to COVID and injuries. Alexander had played in 33 games and Cambridge in 54.\n\n“It challenged me,” Alexander said. “Nothing against the former teammates we had here, but &mldr; the previous teams that we’ve been on, especially freshman year, there wasn’t true leadership, and even if there was some form of it, there weren’t great actions backing it. And so, what does a leader look like? What does a great teammate look like, we really didn’t know, we never had that for ourselves.”\n\nBut as the season has gone on, the two have grown into their roles. In Ralph’s first meeting with the team, it was Cambridge and Alexander who spoke the most, talking about why they came to Vanderbilt and what they wanted out of the season. On the court, they’ve backed it up. Cambridge is averaging 10.1 points per game and is third in the country with 3.89 steals per game. Alexander is averaging 14.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game. They’ve led the Commodores to four SEC wins, tied for the most in six years, and just their second upset over a ranked opponent since 2016 in a senior night win over Florida on Feb. 24.\n\nIt was likely their last game together at Memorial Gymnasium.\n\n“They have given us their heart and soul. And as a coach, as a player, as a woman that's a leader, we couldn’t be doing any anything close to what we’re doing this year without those two young ladies, their effort, their belief and everything that they’ve meant to this program,” Ralph said after the Florida win. “Even before I got here, the fact that they’re local makes it even better, the fact that this is their senior night and their families and friends are here to witness this for them after such a tough stretch for them makes it even better. I will always be grateful that our paths crossed and I’m excited for the next couple of weeks with them.”\n\nFor now, focus is on the SEC Tournament. Both players will have large swaths of extended family in the stands. But after that, the future is unsettled. Cambridge was recently accepted into a master’s program at Vanderbilt and said her plan is to return next season. But Alexander, who has two years of eligibility after getting a medical redshirt for the 2019-20 season, plans to explore her opportunities to play basketball and get a master’s degree anywhere of her choosing as a graduate transfer.\n\nCambridge and Alexander don’t want to think of their last game together, even as it’s approaching quickly. Since the fourth grade, there hasn’t been a time when they weren’t playing together and living near each other. Someday, there will come a time when neither is playing basketball at all. It’s hard to fathom.\n\nBut for now, there’s the SEC Tournament, one last ride in the place it all started.\n\n“I don’t doubt that we won’t still be together,” Alexander said. “Basketball isn’t what keeps us together, right? I think we’re gonna be in each other’s weddings. And she’s gonna be at the birth of my child. &mldr; We’re definitely in this long term, a lifetime of friendship.”"
