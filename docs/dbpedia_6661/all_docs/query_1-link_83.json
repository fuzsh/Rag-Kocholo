        "text": "As one in three UK children are born into poverty, one child will never know that reality thanks to his father's occupation as \"Prince of the United Kingdom\".\n\nThe stark contrast between a child born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and children born to parents throughout the rest of the UK was further highlighted when the birth of Prince George Alexander Louis was formally registered by the couple, who gave their occupations as Prince and Princess of the United Kingdom on his birth certificate.\n\nWhilst most new parents must make their own way to a register office to formally record the birth of baby child, Westminster City Council registrar Alison Cathcart instead travelled to Kensington Palace for William to carry out the task. Then again, most new parents do not give their “usual address” as Kensington Palace, London at the registry office either.\n\nAnd unlike other babies in Britain, Prince George's full name just squeezed into the 'name and surname field' because of the title reserved solely for this child: 'His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge'.\n\nGeorge was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London. His name was announced two days later.\n\nA brief statement from the palace said: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have formally registered the birth of Prince George.\n\n“The Duke of Cambridge signed the birth register at Kensington Palace this morning, witnessed by a Registrar from Westminster Register Office.”\n\nWilliam's full name, His Royal Highness Prince William Arthur Philip Louis Duke of Cambridge, is also given, along with his place of birth in Paddington, Westminster. His wife's full name is given as Catherine Elizabeth Her Royal Highness, The Duchess of Cambridge, with her occupation described as Princess of the United Kingdom.\n\nHer place of birth is listed as Reading, and her maiden name of Middleton is also included on the document.\n\nThe certificate is signed by William, as well as Ms Cathcart, whose title on the document is given as deputy registrar.\n\nMs Cathcart, who has been Westminster City Council's superintendent registrar for 22 years, has presided over several celebrity marriages including Sylvester Stallone, Joan Collins, Barbara Windsor and comedian David Walliams.\n\nShe said: “It was of course a great pleasure to work with Kensington Palace in arranging the signing of the birth certificate for Prince George.\n\n“This cements an association with Westminster City Council and royal births in the borough that goes back decades. We registered the birth of the Queen and Prince Charles and Princes William and Harry so it's great to see that tradition continue.\n\n“We can now add Prince George to that collection and again congratulate the Duke and Duchess on the birth of their son.”"
