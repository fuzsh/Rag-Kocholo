        "text": "Alexander Crummel (1819-1898)\n\nImagine a world where you are seen as an inferior in the land of your birth. Alexander Crummell existed in such a world and had the determination and foresight to try to change it. Alexander Crummell was born in 1819 in New York to Boston Crummell—a former slave—and Charity Hicks, a free black woman. His parents were active and their home was used to publish the first African American newspaper, Freedom’s Journal, which promoted the abolition of the slave trade; Alexander was strongly encouraged by his father to take part in the struggle for African American rights and as a young boy he would work for the American Anti-Slavery Society, an experience that would shape him for the rest of his life. Have a go at creating your own short newspaper article based on Freedom’s Journal, telling about what is going on in your local area. Think of a catchy name for your newspaper, and you can even add photos or drawings to illustrate your article.\n\nFor a free black man of the time, Alexander was well educated and began his formal education at the African Free School in New York alongside other future African American abolitionists James McCune Smith and Henry Highland Garnet. After graduating from the Canal Street High School, Alexander started at Noyes Academy in New Hampshire; however, he wasn’t there for long as the school was soon attacked and destroyed by an angry mob opposed to black students. During his studies at the Oneida Institute in central New York, Alexander realised his calling was to become an Episcopal (Protestant) priest, while his talent as a preacher ensured him a place as a keynote speaker at an anti-slavery convention in 1840.\n\nLithograph of the African Free School, 1922\n\nUnable to enter the General Theological Seminary in New York City because of his race, Alexander studied theology in Massachusetts where he was ordained in 1842. He quickly realised that racism within the Episcopal Church hierarchy in America was endemic and in 1847 he travelled to England to raise money for his small congregation at the Church of the Messiah, Providence, Rhode Island. While in England he preached, spoke about abolitionism in the United States and raised nearly $2,000, the equivalent of $64,150 in today’s money. With the sponsorship of the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay and the surgeon Benjamin Brodie he studied at Queen’s College, Cambridge between 1849-1853 and despite the fact that he had to take his final exams twice to receive his degree, he is the first black student officially recorded as having graduated in the university’s history. He lived at 12/13 Botolph Lane while in Cambridge.\n\nPresident’s Lodge, queen’s College, Cambridge"
