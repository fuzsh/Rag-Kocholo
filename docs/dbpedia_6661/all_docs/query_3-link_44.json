        "text": "Princess Alice of Albany was born at Windsor Castle on 25 February 1883. She was the last surviving granddaughter of Queen Victoria, being the only daughter of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest of the four sons of Queen Victoria.\n\nIn 1903, Princess Alice married Prince Alexander of Teck, brother of Queen Mary. The couple had three children, but only their daughter, Princess May of Teck, later Lady May Cambridge, survived them.\n\nRead More\n\nHow a beguiling French courtesan captured the heart of a young British prince, in a love affair that scandalised the Royal Family\n\nIn 1917, Prince Edward, later King Edward VIII, embarked on an affair with French courtesan Marguerite Alibert that sent shockwaves through British high society\n\nIn 1917, they renounced their German Teck title, and were made Earl and Countess of Athlone, though Princess Alice retained her style of Princess as the male-line granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her husband, the earl, was then appointed Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, and served from 1924-31. Princess Alice accompanied him and was the Vicereine during that period.\n\nLord Athlone and Princess Alice had a coastal beach house constructed at Muizenberg, which still stands today and is one of South Africa's national monuments. The Cape Town suburb of Athlone was named in honour of the Governor-General, and it is the only physical reminder of the Athlones' residence at the Cape.\n\nPrincess Alice accompanied her husband to Canada where he served as Governor General from 1940 to 1946 in Ottawa. Their three grandchildren, Anne, Richard, and Elizabeth, lived with them in Canada for the duration of the war. In 1966, Princess Alice published her memoir, For My Grandchildren.\n\nAs Vicereine of Canada, Princess Alice also supported the war effort by serving as Honorary Commandant of the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service, Honorary Air Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Force Women's Division and president of the nursing division of the St John Ambulance Brigade.\n\nBesides living in both South Africa and Canada, Princess Alice was one of the most well-travelled members of the Royal Family, visiting Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Malaya, Singapore, Siam (now Thailand), Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Uganda, Egypt, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, the West Indies and the United States.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the American Military Government in Bavaria, under the command of General George S. Patton, arrested and imprisoned Princess Alice's brother, Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (who served as a member of the Reichstag from 1937 to 1945), because of his actions as a Nazi supporter during the war. Alice, learning of her brother's incarceration, came to Germany with her husband to plead with his American captors for his release. They would not yield, and in 1946 he was sentenced by a de-nazification court, heavily fined and almost bankrupted."
