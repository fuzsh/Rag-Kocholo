Jessica has been played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (July 5, 1999 - March 15, 2000), Jade Harlow (March 16, 2000 - July 8, 2003) and Danica Stewart (July 10, 2003 - August 7, 2008). She was also played by actress/model Michelle Holgate for two episodes when Jade Harlow was unavailable.\n\nCharacter history\n\nThe youngest child born to Sam and Grace Bennett, Jessica had a relatively normal childhood and was much beloved by her parents, especially Grace. Jessica was quieter and better behaved than her older sister, Kay, who was always scheming to get what she wanted. This caused an antagonistic relationship with Kay. Although Jessica loved Kay at the end of the day, she was also a supporter of the romance between Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald, Kay's crush, and Charity Standish, their newfound cousin. At times, Jessica foiled Kay's plans to break up the couple. Jessica nursed a crush on Reese, who loved Kay, for years.\n\nWhile Jessica had been a minor character for several years, she became a prominent character when Danica Stewart took over the part in 2003. Since then, Jessica has been distraught over the collapse of her parents' marriage and entered into a dangerous relationship with Spike Lester. For a while, Spike forced Jessica to become a drug-addict and work as a prostitute. The couple eventually married in Rome during the summer of 2006, although the wedding was not shown on-air like other marriages on \"Passions\". In November 2006, Jessica attended several meetings of AA for her drinking problem. Jessica had the idea that Miguel wanted her help to forget about Kay and tried to seduce him. Jessica's recovery was set back when she learned that Grace had died in an explosion in London while trying to get home to reunite with Sam.\n\nJessica didn't believe she had the strength to leave Spike, but she was given a vision of her future by Endora and that gave her the strength to move back into her father's house. The same day she moved in, she learned that she was pregnant, apparently by Spike. Spike wanted her to sell the baby and she refused, running to Tabitha's house next door for safety.\n\nSpike tried to kill Jessica by burying her in a crate. Jessica's family and friends searched everywhere for her, but they were too late; Jessica and her unborn baby's spirits left her body. However, Kay had everyone pray to God for Jessica's safe return before they unburied her, causing their spirits to return to Jessica's body. After unburying her, Eve was able to wake up Jessica. She is currently at home with policeman guarding her, since Spike broke out of jail. Sam soon discovered Jessica's role in the murders and was about to arrest her, but thanks to the magical intervention by her novice witch sister Kay, Spike was revealed to be the murderer and arrested by Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald.\n\nJessica returned to Harmony on January 7, 2008, after staying in a convent with her cousin Charity in order to give birth away from Spike and those that she felt were judging her. Either in late 2007 or early January 2008, Jessica gave birth to a son, whom she named Samuel Bennett after her father and grandfather; she eventually gave the boy the middle name of Herbert at the demand of Spike, whose legal first name is Herbert.\n\nKay has since mentioned that Jessica entered rehab to make sure she stayed clean and to keep herself and Samuel away from Spike\n\nJessica returned on July 16, 2008 to wish Kay luck for her wedding to Miguel. She revealed that she had reconciled with Reese, and was continuing in rehab with her son Sam by her side. Jessica did not attend Kay and Miguel's wedding due to the temptations of alcohol.\n\n\"Hidden Passions\"\n\nIn the book \"Hidden Passions\", Jessica's maternal grand parents were Zachary Sutter and Mercy Standish. Her paternal grand parents were named Benjamin Bennett (his name was Samuel on the show) and Margaret Joyce. She also had at least two more uncles in addition to Hank. Information in the book has not been confirmed on-screen and is not considered to be official since the information seen on the show contradicts much of what was said in the book.\n\nee also\n\n*Bennett family\n\n*Standish family\n\nReferences and footnotes\n\nExternal links"
