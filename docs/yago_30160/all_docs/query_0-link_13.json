        "text": "Students: Get free, digital access to books, articles, videos for your classes!\n\nAre you concerned about the high costs of course materials — whether they’re books, articles, or videos? The Library can help! Before registering for a course, you can ask the instructor whether the material will be available via e-reserves, which will provide you with free access to the required materials. After you register, you can look this up in bCourses, if the class has a bCourse site. Refer to Course Reserves for more information, including how to contact the e-reserves team with questions or comments.\n\nHow to Search\n\nThe Class Schedule is a robust tool to help you explore Berkeley’s curricula and find classes that fit your needs. Try the methods below to search your way:\n\nSubject Search\n\nFor an alphanumeric list of classes within a subject, select a subject from the DEPARTMENT SUBJECT drop-down menu above. Classes offered under that subject will display.\n\nKeyword Search\n\nEnter keywords in the search box above to find topics, subjects, or course elements that interest you.\n\nMajor Requirements Search\n\nUse the Search Major Requirements filter in the left menu bar. Start by selecting your requirement year to find classes that meet requirements for the following majors: Bioengineering, Classical Civilizations, Cognitive Science, Data Science, Economics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, English, Environmental Earth Science, Environmental Economics and Policy, Environmental Sciences, Gender and Women’s Studies, Integrative Biology, Landscape Architecture, Mathematics, Molecular and Cell Biology, Molecular Environmental Biology, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Urban Studies.\n\nThis search feature is brought to you by the Student Technology Fund.\n\nInstructor Search\n\nType the name of an instructor into the instructor search field on the left menu bar to see which classes an instructor has taught or is currently teaching (results depend upon what semesters/summer sessions are selected).\n\nAdditional Filters\n\nThe filters on the left allow you to narrow your search to classes with open seats, breadth requirements, days offered, and more. Scroll down to see all the options. All start and end times for classes are stated in Berkeley local time."
