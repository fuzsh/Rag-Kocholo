        "text": "About the collection\n\nMost of the oral histories in the archive were recorded by the University of Nevada Oral History Program from 1964-2013. Oral histories from other sources are part of the digital archive, including several relating to the Stewart Indian School, Reno's Midtown, and Fourth Street/Prater Way. Audio files for many of the oral histories are available from Special Collections upon request.\n\nFinding interviewees\n\nThere are two types of oral history transcripts in the University of Nevada Oral History Archives:\n\nVolume-length interviews of individuals, chronicling their lives\n\nThemed collections of chapter-length stories from multiple individuals\n\nThese alphabetical lists of interviewees link to the volumes for both types of transcripts. To find an interview of an individual within a compilation, use the \"search inside\" magnifying glass icon or download the pdf and use the Acrobat Reader search function. To search for a name, word or phrase within the entire collection of transcripts, use the search box in the left column of the University of Nevada Oral History Transcripts collection page in the Internet Archive."
