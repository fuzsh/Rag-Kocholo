        "text": "IN SHORT\n\nSCIENTISTS FIND DOG AGGRESSION-GUT MICROBE LINK\n\nResearchers at Oregon State University have identified a link between gut microbes and aggressive behavior in dogs.\n\nTheir study, published Jan. 9 online in PeerJ at jav.ma/microbesbehavior, stops short of saying the composition of a dog's gut microbiome causes aggressiveness or vice versa, only that statistical associations exist between a dog's behavior and the microbes it hosts.\n\nResearchers looked at 31 pit bull-type dogs, 14 male and 17 female, rescued from a dogfighting operation. Each animal was screened by an animal welfare agency and categorized as aggressive or nonaggressive. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed.\n\nFirmicutes, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla among all stool samples, but their abundance differed between aggressive and nonaggressive animals. Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria were more abundant in relative terms in nonaggressive dogs, whereas Firmicutes was relatively more abundant in dogs showing aggression, according to an OSU press release.\n\nOther microbiome differences between aggressive and nonaggressive dogs were observed at the operational taxonomic unit.\n\nAIRVET, VSG PARTNER ON TELEMEDICINE\n\nAirvet announced a new partnership in mid-January to be the telemedicine platform of choice for the 1,400-plus member practices of Veterinary Study Groups Inc.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, Airvet uses cloud-based technology to offer an app that enables veterinarians to connect with their clients via live video, audio, and chat. Airvet also includes a built-in triage service available 24/7 to pet owners.\n\nVSG consists of veterinary management groups. Each group is made up of 16-22 individuals and meets biannually to share information, data, and management experiences.\n\n“We are excited about this strategic partnership as we look to help our independent veterinary practices further leverage new technologies and implement telemedicine to prepare to meet the ever-changing expectations of their clients,” said Steve Curvey, VSG chief operating officer, in an announcement about the partnership.\n\nBrandon Werber, Airvet CEO, said, “Our focus is and will continue to be on leveraging technology to create new efficiencies in a practice's daily workflow, and provide a seamless continuity of care for clients, all without taxing an already busy practice.”\n\nSTUDY LINKS ORDER OF TREATMENTS, DRUG RESISTANCE\n\nWhen treating recurring bovine respiratory disease, the order of antimicrobials used may influence the likelihood of drug resistance.\n\nTreating BRD with bacteriostatic antibiotics, which inhibit bacterial growth, followed by bactericidal ones, which kill bacteria during a growth phase, may increase the risk of selecting for drug-resistant bacteria, according to study results published in December through PLOS One.\n\nThe article, citing a 2011 feedlot study, indicates about 15% of feedlot cattle receive multiple treatments for BRD, and more than 90% of those subsequent treatments involve a different class of antimicrobial. The authors of the 2019 article examined connections between drug class selection and antimicrobial susceptibility among Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni isolates.\n\nTheir examination used isolates that were sent to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory over three years along with case histories with documented treatments.\n\nThe authors found associations between increasing numbers of treatments and increasing antimicrobial resistance. They also found more frequent resistance when cattle received subsequent treatments with antimicrobials that had different mechanisms.\n\nTreating an M haemolytica infection with tulathromycin, which is bacteriostatic, followed by ceftiofur, which is bactericidal, was associated with the highest probability of drug resistance.\n\nThe research team is associated with Iowa State University, Kansas State University, and Drake University.

The Association encourages the use of alternatives but says professional judgment is key when making a decision as to whether to declaw a cat.\n\nOn Jan. 11, leaders in the AVMA House of Delegates updated the Association's policy on declawing, or onychectomy, to emphasize that the AVMA defers to veterinarians to decide what's best for each patient and client.\n\nThe resolution passed with 84% of the vote during the HOD regular winter session in Chicago.\n\nThe prior policy, last updated in 2014, indicated the procedure should be a last resort but focused on encouraging client education. The new policy still encourages education on cat behavior, the surgery, and its risks but also clearly calls out the importance of professional judgment when making the decision to declaw or not.\n\nBoth versions of the policy state that cats undergoing the surgery must receive pain management.\n\nThe House, which represents state and allied associations, is the Association's main policy-setting body.\n\nSTANDARDS AND PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT\n\nDiscouraging elective declawing is consistent with positions from the American Association of Feline Practitioners and American Animal Hospital Association, which also discourage declawing and encourage veterinarians to educate clients about alternatives. The AVMA policy was revised partly in response to states and cities adding or considering measures to ban elective declawing.\n\nAAFP leaders state in their policy that feline declawing is ethically controversial, unnecessary in most instances, and a response to behaviors cats inherit and learn. The AAHA position statement indicates a few circumstances—such as tumors or chronic infections—for which claw removal may be required, but it notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not list declawing among potential means of preventing disease in humans.\n\nAhead of voting to enact the new AVMA policy, delegates debated whether the proposal as a whole or select statements within it would limit veterinary practice, set rigid pain management standards, or bolster arguments in favor of state or city bans on declawing. They also discussed the potential for the AVMA to lead on animal welfare concerns important to the public and speak on behalf of animals.\n\nIn July 2019, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation that instituted the first statewide ban on elective declawing in cats. Echoing the sentiments of proponents of the bill, he issued a statement that described the practice as archaic and cruel and causing pain.\n\nCities including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, and St. Louis have added bans since 2003, when West Hollywood, California, became the first in the nation to prohibit onychectomy except for medical reasons. Banfield Pet Hospital adopted a policy in January that its veterinarians would perform surgical claw removal only out of medical necessity, and the policy will extend to all Mars Veterinary Health hospitals—including VCA and BluePearl—in the first quarter of 2020, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nThe Banfield policy states that “Current evidence does not support the use of elective declawing surgery as an alternative to relinquishment, abandonment, or euthanasia.”\n\nDr. Apryl Steele, alternate delegate for the AAFP, said during discussion of the House resolution that the AVMA should lead by discouraging elective declawing and, if the delegates voted down the proposed change, risked being remembered for failing to do so.\n\nDr. Neil Moss, delegate for Utah, said he thinks most veterinarians would be relieved if declawing were banned. He said that since a series of laws banned cosmetic tail docking of dogs throughout the United Kingdom, those limits have become noncontroversial.\n\nThese bans are region based and include some exceptions for working dogs and medical needs, according to breeding and sporting organizations.\n\nDr. Sam Miller, alternate delegate for Texas, said that his state's delegation would have difficulty supporting the change in AVMA policy despite reading in House email discussions that veterinarians perform few onychectomies anymore.\n\nThe revised AVMA policy on “Declawing of Domestic Cats” reads as follows:\n\nThe AVMA discourages the declawing (onychectomy) of cats as an elective procedure and supports non-surgical alternatives to the procedure. The AVMA respects the veterinarian's right to use professional judgment when deciding how to best protect their individual patients’ health and welfare. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the veterinarian to counsel the owner about the natural scratching behavior of cats, the alternatives to surgery, as well as the details of the procedure itself and subsequent potential complications. Onychectomy is a surgical amputation and if performed, multimodal perioperative pain management must be utilized.\n\n“The concern that a lot of the veterinarians had is that AVMA was going to dictate policy on how practitioners were supposed to practice and starting to restrict some of the things that we can do,” he said.\n\nDr. Miller cited statements in the proposed policy that it was incumbent on veterinarians to counsel owners and that veterinarians performing the surgery must provide multimodal perioperative pain management. He recommended referring the proposal back to the AVMA Animal Welfare Committee, via the AVMA Board of Directors, for reconsideration. Delegates voted down his proposal.\n\nDelegates also debated whether the statement on professional judgment should lead off the policy, whether the policy would assure lawmakers the procedure would be performed in humane ways, whether the changes could encourage those who want to ban the procedure, whether stating veterinarians must administer multimodal pain management was too prescriptive to accommodate special cases of ill cats, and whether veterinarians should perform elective procedures on cats too ill to receive multimodal pain management.\n\nDr. K. Fred Gingrich II, alternate delegate for the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said veterinary organizations should be comfortable with advocating for standards of care. He noted that the AABP enacted new dehorning guidelines in late 2019 that said pain management is part of the standard of care.\n\nIf veterinarians are unable to think of a situation where pain management would be inappropriate, the word “must” is appropriate in the policy.\n\n“We should speak for the cat here, and it must be provided,” he said.\n\nETHICAL DILEMMA\n\nBefore voting on resolutions, the House divides into groups known as reference committees that deliberate on resolutions or issues and report to the House. The committees may recommend that the House pass, defeat, or modify a resolution, but their advice is nonbinding.\n\nDr. Enid Stiles, president-elect of the Canadian VMA, told delegates during one reference committee meeting that the CVMA encourages the AVMA to pass the resolution and strengthen its statement. In 2017, her organization published a policy of opposition to elective and nontherapeutic onychectomy.\n\nDr. Stiles said the CVMA policy has helped advance regulations and end the procedure, which is now allowed in only three of Canada's 10 provinces. She said members are happy with the change.\n\n“There's no competition with their neighbor declawing,” she said. “They don't need to worry about that anymore. They can just do what they've been told to do, which is provide excellent medical care for their patients and not worry about medically unnecessary procedures.”\n\nDr. Stiles said in an interview outside the meeting she has heard that, across Canada, fewer people ask for declawing, and she believes the same is true in the U.S. She also thinks the procedure can contribute to compassion fatigue and burnout among veterinarians who are uncomfortable with declawing but work at clinics where they need to perform it.\n\nDr. Steele, who was in the same reference committee meeting, said afterward that veterinarians, especially newer associates, are struggling with having to perform onychectomies. Results of an AAFP survey of 1,200 feline practitioners indicated 51% do not declaw cats and slightly more support legislative bans on the procedure, she said.\n\n“What that tells us is they're ethically opposed to declawing and they're having to do it anyway,” Dr. Steele said. “Of the ones who do declaw, 75% do it less than once a month.”\n\nThe AAFP includes members who work in Canadian provinces with onychectomy bans. Dr. Steele said she has heard only praise from those members.\n\n“You would think that there would be a mix or there would be a loss of revenue, but it has been a relief that they don't even have to have the conversation anymore,” Dr. Steele said. “I don't know a single veterinarian that enjoys declawing a cat.”\n\nDr. Steele later would praise the delegates’ vote to enact the new policy.\n\n“It does take a much stronger stance from the AVMA, and it does require that pain medication be used for cats,” she said. “It was a little bit of a fight, but we're happy.”\n\nHOD ADOPTS POLICIES ON CRIBBING, MICROCHIPPING ANIMALS\n\nStory and photo by R. Scott Nolen\n\nThe AVMA House of Delegates on Jan. 11 overwhelmingly voted to adopt a new policy on humanely managing horse cribbing and a revised policy concerning microchip identification of animals.\n\nAdditionally, delegates approved recommendations relating to two topics discussed during the Veterinary Information Forum held the previous day (see story, page 508).\n\nThe first recommendation concerns potential liability issues related to student externs and practice volunteers. The House voted for a recommendation that the AVMA Board of Directors consider developing a toolkit, including potential forms, and an awareness campaign to protect practitioners, students, and other members of the veterinary health care team.\n\nThe second recommendation relates to online veterinary care and telehealth. Delegates voted for a recommendation that the AVMA continue developing guidelines for this quickly emerging area and that AVMA members contact telehealth@avma.org with further questions about the issue.\n\nThe HOD agenda also included two additional policy proposals, one dealing with cat declawing (see story, page 502) and the other on using technology in veterinary medicine.\n\nDelegates adopted a new policy on technology that combines related policies into a single statement, giving the AVMA latitude to advocate for the use of technology in veterinary medicine.\n\nCRIBBING\n\nCribbing is a common equine stereotypy during which a horse grasps a solid object, such as a stall door or fence rail, with its incisor teeth. In 2019, the AVMA Animal Welfare Committee learned that injurious devices are being used to curb the behavior, the committee explained in the policy backgrounder.\n\nMetal hog rings are one such device cited by the AWC. Placed through the incisors and around the teeth of a horses, the hog ring causes gingival damage, periodontal disease, and abrasive wear to the teeth.\n\n“Unfortunately, this practice is not only prevalent in the lay industry but is also being performed by some veterinarians,” the AWC stated.\n\nThe American Association of Equine Practitioners adopted a similar policy against the use of hog rings placed around the maxillary incisors to prevent cribbing in horses.\n\nThe policy, approved unanimously by the HOD, reads as follows:\n\nManagement of Cribbing in Horses\n\nCribbing (also known as crib biting or windsucking) is one of many repetitive behaviors known as stereotypies, which are sometimes demonstrated by horses. A variety of devices have been utilized to prevent horses from cribbing, including hog rings. The AVMA condemns the use of hog rings or other devices placed around the teeth to prevent cribbing in horses. These devices are detrimental to the welfare and health of the horse due to the potential to cause persistent pain, damage to the gingiva, periodontal disease and abrasive wear to adjacent teeth. The AVMA encourages research to understand and address the underlying causes of cribbing.\n\nPrior to the vote, when the policy's adoption seemed assured, Dr. Lauren Atkins, Massachusetts delegate, addressed her colleagues. “I'd like to say how proud I am of this organization. This is what it looks like to be a leader in animal welfare,” Dr. Atkins said.\n\nMICROCHIPS\n\nThe revised AVMA policy on microchips is the work of the Council on Veterinary Service, State Advocacy Committee, and Animal Welfare Committee, which realized the previous AVMA policy had become cumbersome.\n\nAs the entities explained in the policy background, there are valid reasons to scan new patients and regularly scan existing patients for implanted microchips. However, dictating in the policy the precise situations, frequency, or procedure for such scanning may impinge on or conflict with state laws regarding property ownership.\n\nFor example, if a veterinarian has already established a veterinarian-client-patient relationship with a new client, then discovers that the client's animal has a microchip of which the owner was unaware, the requirements and ability of the veterinarian to attempt to notify anyone about this situation are likely limited owing to the existing VCPR.\n\nIn light of these real-world challenges, the AVMA entities proposed a scaled-down version of the current policy. Delegates voted in favor of the revised statement, which reads as follows:\n\nMicrochips: Identification of Companion Animals and Equids\n\nThe AVMA endorses the implantation of electronic identification in companion animals and equids and supports standardization in materials, procedures, equipment, and registries. Veterinary healthcare teams are thereby encouraged to recommend the implantation of electronic identification of animals to their clients.\n\nThe objectives of an effective system of electronic identification of animals are to:\n\nThe AVMA supports ISO (International Organization for Standardization) compliant RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology that adheres to and is based on ISO 11784/11785 standards.\n\nAVMA DEVELOPS PLAN FOR COMBATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN PROFESSION\n\nAVMA leadership on Jan. 10 reviewed an Association-prepared report on sexual harassment in the workplace and a plan for how the AVMA will help the veterinary profession address the problem.\n\nThe report, developed by the AVMA Board of Directors, comes at the direction of an AVMA House of Delegates resolution from this past July. That resolution dealt with sexual harassment awareness and was submitted by 10 state and allied VMAs.\n\nIn addition to formally recognizing the seriousness of the issue, the resolution requested that the Board review existing AVMA sexual harassment policies and develop additional resources for members. Further, the House resolution recommended that the Board update delegates by the 2020 HOD regular winter session, being held Jan. 10-11.\n\nThe Board shared its report with the House in early December 2019. The report had the following four action steps for the AVMA:\n\n• Update the AVMA website in 2020 to include additional resources on preventing sexual harassment in the workplace and provide assistance to both veterinary employers and employees.\n\n• Include continuing education programs related to preventing sexual harassment on AVMA Axon, the Association's online CE platform, such as the Workplace Wellbeing Certificate Program.\n\n• Identify specific workplace harassment training programs to recommend to veterinary practices.\n\n• Request that the AVMA Council on Veterinary Service conduct a review this year of the AVMA policy on “Harassment and Discrimination-Free Veterinary Workplace,” in collaboration with the AVMA Department of Human Resources, for continued relevance and scope.\n\nAVMA resources and programs need not be limited to sexual harassment, the report noted, but should address workplace harassment and discrimination broadly, also accounting for illegal workplace conduct based on race, ethnicity, and religion.\n\nOn Jan. 10, during the Veterinary Information Forum portion of the HOD's winter session in Chicago, Dr. Rena Carlson, chair of the AVMA Board of Directors, and Dr. Rex Anderson, Montana delegate and member of the House Advisory Committee, reviewed the report and plan for delegates.\n\n“The Board did exactly what we asked them to do,” Dr. Anderson said. “What happens now is up to us.”\n\nAVMA leaders discuss potential legal liability of student, volunteer work\n\nHouse of Delegates also talks about cannabis, telehealth\n\nBy Greg Cima and Malinda Larkin\n\nWork on farms and in clinics provides future veterinarians valuable experience, but allowing students and other nonemployees to work or volunteer in a veterinary practice can raise concerns about potential liability.\n\nAVMA leaders called for guidance and education during a discussion on the use of students, externs, and volunteers in veterinary practices. The discussion was part of the Veterinary Information Forum, a series of short discussions on priority topics for the AVMA House of Delegates.\n\nOther topics included the current status of cannabidiol-containing products in veterinary medicine and ongoing AVMA efforts to encourage the use of telehealth services while maintaining standards of care. The delegates met Jan. 10-11 in Chicago as part of the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference, a combination of AVMA governance meetings and professional development sessions.\n\nSTUDENT LAWSUIT\n\nIn 2017, a Missouri jury found a veterinarian and a cattle owner each partly responsible for injuries suffered in 2009 by a then veterinary student who was vaccinating cattle on a farm when a calf crushed her hand against the wall of a cattle chute. The jury also found the veterinary student partially responsible. A state appellate court affirmed the decision in March 2019.\n\nThe appellate court ruling states that the student was working with a farm worker who was unauthorized to supervise her. That farm worker did not properly restrain the calves for vaccination and responded in anger to the student's safety concerns.\n\nAn unrestrained calf jumped and crushed the student's hand, the court file states. She suffered a carpal bone fracture and, according to the ruling, developed chronic conditions associated with arm and shoulder pain.\n\nA jury decided the cattle operation was responsible for $3 million in damages and the supervising veterinarian for $1.2 million.\n\nDr. Jim Brett, a representative on the House Advisory Committee, said volunteer work and externships with private practitioners have great educational value, noting that veterinary colleges consider such work experience when evaluating admission applications and that some colleges with distributed education models rely on partnerships with private practices to teach clinical skills.\n\nDr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive vice president of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said some veterinarians seem to be uncertain about whether their insurance covers injuries to volunteers and externs. He also said the potential legal liability risk may discourage cattle-owning clients from allowing student volunteers to work on their animals.\n\nHe wants education on what veterinarians should do when a student is injured, as well as what veterinarians can do to reduce their legal risk.\n\nA GREY AREA\n\nDr. Andrew Maccabe, CEO of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, said in a reference committee meeting that while the Missouri student's lawsuit was a singular case, it was an important one that highlighted and caused veterinary leaders to pay attention to what has been a grey area for many practitioners or one that many may have been unaware of.\n\n“The opportunity for (veterinary) students and prevet students to shadow is valuable and benefits the profession. But we need to ensure there is appropriate oversight and safety and personal injury and liability issues are covered, so that when accidents do happen, there isn't an uncovered liability people are responsible for,” he said.\n\nHe noted that, in general, if a student is injured while engaged in an activity overseen by a veterinary school through a formal relationship with a private practice, the student would generally be covered under the university's insurance policy.\n\nThis is the situation, for instance, for practices that participate with a veterinary school in a distributed education model. “Those are where employers are often paid to take students, and the employers may be considered adjunct faculty usually. That's a high order, and those are well regulated,” Dr. Maccabe said.\n\nThe situation may be less clear for practices that offer externships or clerkships as an elective or for no credit. At many schools, he said, the associate dean's office has a list of several practices with which the veterinary school has an agreement outlining how the practices will manage students, but these may not address potential legal liability issues.\n\nHowever, grey areas can arise when students and practices engage in informal arrangements, even if it's with a student who previously worked at the practice through a school-sanctioned program. This is also true when preveterinary students seek out opportunities to shadow a veterinarian on their own and when individuals volunteer in clinics.\n\nMarie Bucco, Student AVMA president, said this may be an opportunity for SAVMA to educate students, too, by working with the American Preveterinary Medical Association to develop an FAQ or checklist.\n\n“Most students assume they'll be covered or things will get taken care of,” she said. As a former prevet student, she said, she would have just accepted it as her own fault if an accident occurred. “But it would be good to remind students to ask questions at a practice you're about to shadow.”\n\nIn an effort to better understand and address these issues, the HOD recommended that the AVMA Board of Directors consider the development of a toolkit, including potential forms, and an awareness campaign for the protection of practitioners, students, and other members of the veterinary health care team.\n\nCANNABIS AND TELEHEALTH\n\nIntroducing the discussion on cannabis-derived products, Dr. William Flynn, deputy director for science policy in the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said the agency is deliberating how to manage or regulate such products, which have not been approved as food additives or for therapeutic uses in animals. CBD has some recognized clinical benefits in humans, but many unanswered questions and safety-related data gaps remain, he said.\n\nSome data raise concerns about potential harm to animals, especially toxic effects on the liver and male reproductive organs, Dr. Flynn said.\n\nFDA officials issued warning letters to 22 companies that sold illegal CBD products in 2019; 15 of those companies were selling such products for use in animals.\n\nDelegates indicated they want guidance and leadership from AVMA on how to approach use of products.\n\nMarijuana is legal in 11 states for recreational use among adults over the age of 21 and legal for medical use in 33 states. State veterinary medical boards have given varying direction to veterinarians regarding communication with their clients.\n\nDr. Mike Jones, delegate from Oklahoma, said in a reference committee meeting that since his state legalized medical cannabis in October 2018, pet intoxication is astronomical now.\n\n“These dogs are stumbling in the exam room and peeing all over the place. I've been at it 29 years, and this is new. We're seeing one to two a week in practice,” he said. “The dogs don't eat just one, they eat the whole bag. … Back in the days when it was illegal, you used to hide it, but now it's out and legal to have,” and pets can get into it more easily.\n\nDr. Melanie Marsden, District IX AVMA Board of Directors representative, said practitioners in her state of Colorado also saw a spike in marijuana intoxication after the drug became legal recreationally in 2014. She said: “Now, I see (intoxication) maybe once every few months. I don't know if it will be similar, but that has been our experience.”\n\nIn telehealth, AVMA staff and volunteer leaders indicated many pet owners want more options for reaching veterinarians from a distance, and veterinarians are increasing their use of remote consultations with specialists. Whether veterinarians can establish a veterinarian-client-patient relationship without an in-person examination remains a source of debate.\n\nVETERINARY STUDENTS FIND LEADERSHIP ROLES MATTER AT EVERY LEVEL\n\nStory and photo by Malinda Larkin\n\n“Don't Be a Crab” was the slogan Kristina Williams used when running for class president at Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, which refers to the crabs-in-a-bucket mentality. That is, when two crabs are in a bucket, as soon as one tries to climb out of the bucket, the other will grab the escaping crab by the legs and try to escape itself, with the result that neither crab ends up escaping.\n\n“In veterinary school, there's lots of competition. People don't learn how to work together, and then they get in the real world, where it's collaboration heavy, and they get culture shock,” Williams said. “I think a lot of mental health problems take root in vet school—it's very high stress … and difficult enough without that cut-throat mentality.”\n\nWilliams was one of four Student AVMA members selected to share their perspectives on leadership as veterinary students during the session “Our Passion, Our Profession, Our Perspectives on the Future” Jan. 11 at the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference in Chicago. They also were among 30 students who received scholarships from SAVMA that covered travel, hotel, and registration expenses for them to attend the VLC.\n\nAva Mastrostefano, a second-year student at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, said she was inspired by the resources she learned about at the conference. As president of Tuft's SAVMA Wellness Committee, she's looking forward to sharing with fellow members the AVMA's “My Veterinary Life” podcast and resources from avma.org/wellbeing.\n\nMastrostefano said her positions in nonclinical leadership have proved just as valuable as the clinical experiences she'll receive because they will make her a better veterinarian overall.\n\nKayla Corey, a second-year veterinary student at Texas A&M University, admits she had burned herself out on leadership during her undergraduate years. Instead of taking roles she was passionate about, Corey says she took roles that she thought would look good on her resume. So far, she hasn't sought any positions at her veterinary college, but that will now change.\n\n“You have to find your own ‘why,’ so when you start going into leadership, you know why you're doing it. That's more motivating. It's why I'm ready to get back into leadership roles in the veterinary community,” Corey said, adding that attending the VLC has increased her motivation.\n\nDuring the session, Williams shared a story about when she ran into a woman on a bus who asked what she did for a living.\n\n“I responded with ‘I'm just a vet tech,’ and the lady told me to never say you're ‘just’ anything because every time you do, your salary goes down,” she said. “This goes back to impostor syndrome and devaluing your accomplishments. You can be a leader in your field without holding some high-ranking position.”\n\nGetting teams to talk\n\nPractice owners, managers unite at the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference\n\nStory and photo by Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nAny and all problems people have are relationship problems, said Dr. Andrew Sloyer during a session at the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference in Chicago.\n\nPractice owners, practice managers, and other professionals came together to discuss the challenges of running a practice as a team during the Jan. 9 session “Leadership Through Partnership: Owners and Managers Working Together.”\n\nThe session's goals included assessing the working relationships of the attendees to identify areas for improvement, understanding the roles and responsibilities within a practice to promote trust and autonomy, determining the decision-making process and areas of authority, and understanding strategic and operational planning as well as how improving work relationships can help achieve goals.\n\nThe AVMA and Veterinary Hospital Managers Association organized the session, which was led by Bethany Bankovich Mihalik, the hospital administrator at Neffsville Veterinary Clinic in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Dr. Sloyer, owner and managing partner at the clinic.\n\nMihalik, a certified practice manager and certified veterinary technician, said the veterinary industry and practices are very relationship centered but mostly focused on the relationship between the client and veterinarian, not among the team within the practice.\n\n“We don't take the time to figure out what we are doing,” she said. “Today we are going to focus on us.”\n\nDuring the session, about 35 attendees discussed the challenges they face within their practices and their teams, including the lack of time to have regular meetings together to discuss operations, difficulties communicating with each other, and obstacles to reinforcing the chain of command throughout the team.\n\nMihalik and Dr. Sloyer focused heavily on their own experiences as manager and owner. They also discussed the need to identify and understand the different communication styles within a team.\n\nCommunication styles that the session focused on included the following:\n\n• Thinkers are people who function in a steady and tenacious manner. They rely on observations and rational principles.\n\n• Feelers are people who are dynamic and stimulating. They are sensitive to the needs and wants of others.\n\n• Sensors are doers. They tend to thrive with a wide variety of projects and tasks.\n\n• Intuitors are fast and deep thinkers with excellent imaginations.\n\nMihalik and Dr. Sloyer suggested that a practice offer a communication self-assessment to staff members and discuss the positives, the drawbacks, and the stressors of each style and how staff members can then own that behavior and work better together as a team.\n\n“It is not just enough to know the style; you have to know how to motivate and reward,” Mihalik said. “We also have to take responsibility and ownership for ourselves and our own actions (and style).”\n\nThe session also included information about autonomy, how to build trust within the manager-owner relationship, what a positive working relationship looks like, what some relationship red flags are, and using a strategic plan as a relationship-building opportunity.\n\nNeffsville Veterinary Clinic first started doing strategic planning in 2004. Mihalik and Dr. Sloyer used that experience as an example of how the process can bring a team together. Strategic planning can allow for discussion of what is and isn't working within a practice and potential goals for the future, Mihalik said. Creating a mission and values for the practice, then assigning short- and long-term goals for team members to achieve related to the strategic plan allows for collaboration, growth, and accountability as a team.\n\nTaking steps against educational debt\n\nSession features new playbook of resources for veterinary associations\n\nStory and photo by Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nThe educational debt crisis was a key topic of conversation among students, association leaders, and veterinary college representatives at the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference, Jan. 10 in Chicago.\n\nThe session “Beyond Dollars and Cents: Leadership in Student Debt Strategies” included discussion of what the overall educational debt in the profession looks like, types of support associations can provide, strategies for leadership, and what effective financial resources are being and should be offered.\n\nSpecifically, the Veterinary Medical Association Executives compiled a list of resources to assist state and other veterinary associations in creating educational debt strategies.\n\nRalph Johnson, CEO of VMAE, announced the Ready. Set. Go! Tackle Educational Debt Initiative, which includes a step-by-step guide providing a menu of options that VMAs can take.\n\n“We all own this problem,” Johnson said. “As VMAs, we must act.”\n\nThe guide includes the following suggestions:\n\n• Start a conversation by the board of directors about what role the VMA will take in the debt crisis, how to create action against the issue, how to engage volunteers, and resources the VMA can use for this issue.\n\n• Speak with early-career veterinarians about educational debt and how it affects their lives.\n\n• Commit to an action that reflects VMA strategies.\n\n• Take action by, for example, creating an educational debt resource center, spreading the word, or creating a scholarship fund.\n\n• Track and measure progress, and adjust actions based on best practices.\n\nThe guide is available courtesy of the Veterinary Debt Initiative, which is led by the AVMA, Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and VMAE, and is focused on helping veterinarians pursue financially sustainable careers. The guide is available at jav.ma/ReadySetGo.\n\n“I'm so pleased VMAE has put together such a comprehensive playbook of resources that we can use to address veterinary educational debt,” said Candace Joy, executive director of the Washington State VMA, to JAVMA News. “I plan on incorporating many of the excellent tools and strategies provided so my organization can help our members tackle an issue that touches all areas of the profession.”\n\nJoy offered several examples during the session of what the Washington State VMA currently does to help members with educational debt, such as offering the services of a financial consultant as well as offering new graduates the opportunity to review employee contracts with a lawyer.\n\nJack Advent, executive director of the Ohio VMA, told JAVMA News that educational debt can be an overwhelming topic for a state VMA to start working on because it is a complex and daunting issue.\n\n“Having a broad list of possible ideas such as those in the playbook can be extremely helpful in creating a launch point or supplementing what you are already doing as an organization,” he said.\n\nThe VLC session also included information about the effectiveness of financial literacy programs.\n\nDr. Caroline Cantner, director for professional development at the AAVMC, said during the session that the profession needs to rethink how it teaches financial literacy.\n\n“Lecture learning doesn't lead to change,” she said, adding that financial literacy resources need to include information about the emotional side of money.\n\n“What is your emotional relationship with money?” Dr. Cantner asked.\n\nWhat veterinary educational debt looks like when broken down by the numbers and a discussion on the overall educational debt load in society also came up during the session.\n\nDr. Andrew T. Maccabe, CEO of the AAVMC, spoke during the session about the cost of a veterinary education.\n\nThe cost of tuition is the biggest factor in educational debt, but tuition is set by the university, and the cost results from a “systematic disinvestment in higher education,” he said.\n\nIn the past 10 years, state funding for public colleges has been substantially reduced.\n\nPublic colleges received about $6.6 billion less in state funding in 2018 than in 2008, after adjusting for inflation, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank. States have made efforts to reinvest in higher education, but tuition at public colleges remains high. The mean annual tuition at four-year public colleges has risen $2,708 nationally since 2008. More data and information on the price of higher education and reduced state funding can be found at jav.ma/funding.\n\nEducational debt is a significant issue in veterinary medicine, but debt doesn't just affect veterinarians.\n\nThe overall outstanding U.S. educational debt is $1.50 trillion, according to the Household Debt and Credit Report for the third quarter of 2019 from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education recently released a new website for information on federal student aid that combines information from other federal sites for students at studentaid.gov.\n\nAlong with the resources from VMAE, the AVMA has tools to help veterinarians handle their educational debt at jav.ma/Repayment.\n\nClients driving you nuts? Retrain your brain\n\nSpeaker at VLC outlines steps on how to be more compassionate to the most difficult people\n\nStory and photo by Malinda Larkin\n\nClients who say they're listening but don't follow any of the instructions you gave. Clients who manhandle their cat to get it out of the cage instead of letting you try to help. Clients who yell at the front desk staff about the cost of a nail trim.\n\nSome clients may seem as though they can't be controlled without sedation. But Dr. Sarah J. Wooten, a former practicing veterinarian turned leadership and personal development speaker, says with the proper tools, even the most unruly ones can be tamed. It just takes some understanding and a different mindset for veterinarians and staff to take back their practices.\n\nThe first thing to remember is what it's like to be on the other side of the examination table. Clients have no control over what is happening. Often they feel afraid that their pet is in pain and worry that their pet will be taken from the room.\n\nUnderlying all of that are other ongoing fears. How much is this going to cost? Am I going to be able to afford this?\n\n“So they project on the nearest, nicest unsuspecting person, which is you. We are worldwide receptacles of everyone's bad behaviors,” Dr. Wooten said. “We need to remember we serve people in crisis. We don't go into veterinary medicine for this, but it is what it is.”\n\nThe trick is understanding fear behaviors—in yourself or others—and consciously overriding them, Dr. Wooten said. These fight-or-flight responses can involve some of the following:\n\n• Getting defensive.\n\n• Ignoring or avoiding issues.\n\n• Disengaging.\n\n• Using humor or jokes to deflect.\n\n• Pretending to agree to avoid conflict.\n\n• Aggressively arguing.\n\n• Interrupting.\n\n• Bullying others into submission.\n\n• Behaving condescendingly.\n\nAwareness, or mentally noting what is happening, helps to de-escalate the situation.\n\n“When you're removed a little from drama, it gives you enough space from the stimulus to consciously choose your response in that situation,” Dr. Wooten said. “You can take control of your reaction and the situation by observing the client, silently labeling the client's fear reaction, and responding without judgment.”\n\nAnother tool is empathetic statements, which can reduce unproductive reactions during a difficult or triggering situation. A few examples include the following:\n\n• “Hi there. I'm Dr. Doe. How are you doing?\n\n• “I'm sure this isn't what you planned to do today, right?”\n\n• “This is hard. I'm sorry.”\n\n• “I understand you are worried. We are going to do everything we can.”\n\nCoupling these statements with eye contact, smiling, and listening reflectively can also help, she said.\n\nFinally, meeting the client's need for certainty and autonomy can go a long way. That means being upfront and transparent about how you will proceed with the examination, the options the client has, and what each option would mean as far as price and possible health outcomes.\n\nDoing all these things will not only increase a person's emotional intelligence but also help decrease compassion fatigue and increase productivity.\n\nShe notes that it's easier said than done to hit the pause button before reacting, especially in the heat of the moment. Doing so takes intention as well as patience with yourself and others.\n\n“This is all about practice. You won't get it right the first time, but eventually you'll hit the target, and you'll be able to choose your responses in any situation,” Dr. Wooten said.\n\nDr. Jennifer Schurrer, practice manager and veterinarian at East Central Veterinarians in Minnesota, said the workshop was good for refining her skill set. She has applied similar teachings in her practice to create more cohesion between the two clinics she helps run. Now she hopes to train the staff on how to react more empathetically to clients.\n\nHOUSE ELECTS TWO TO COUNCIL ON RESEARCH\n\nIn January, the AVMA House of Delegates filled two vacancies on the AVMA Council on Research. The HOD elected Dr. Miles Theurer of Cimarron, Kansas, to represent private clinical practice and Dr. Mila Kundu of Morrisville, Pennsylvania, to represent veterinary medical research.\n\nFELINE FOAMY VIRUS IS EVERYWHERE\n\nBy Katie Burns\n\nExposure to or infection with feline foamy virus is common in pumas and domestic cats in Colorado, Southern California, and Florida, according to two recent studies. Another recent study found frequent cross-species transmission of FFV between domestic cats and pumas.\n\nThe overall seroprevalence of antibodies against FFV was 78.6% across subpopulations of pumas from those three states, according to a study published April 19 in the online journal Viruses. The FFV seroprevalence was 64.0% among domestic cats at eight animal shelters in those same states, according to a study published Sept. 16 in the online Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery Open Reports.\n\n“Despite FFV having been associated with increased viral loads in retroviral co-infections and with histological changes in lung and kidney tissue, the virus is still poorly understood and not well documented in most countries, especially the United States,” said Sarah Kechejian, the first author on the prevalence studies and a fourth-year veterinary student at Colorado State University.\n\nA third study from the research collaborators found that FFV variants from domestic cats and pumas were not distinguishable at the host level. Analyses supported frequent cross-species spillover from domestic cats to pumas during the last century as well as frequent puma-to-puma transmission in Colorado, according to the study published in January in the journal Virus Evolution.\n\n“The high FFV seroprevalence in U.S. domestic and wild cats exposes how connected these individuals are to each other—and shows how vulnerable the populations are to infectious disease transmission,” Kechejian said. “The data also spark discussion on the potential risks associated with a poorly understood retrovirus almost reaching ubiquity in domestic and wild cats.”\n\nThe research collaborators are not pursuing further FFV prevalence studies at this time, Kechejian said, but owned cats could have a lower seroprevalence when compared with the study populations.\n\nAmong domestic cats admitted to shelters because of nonowner surrender or that were involved in trap-neuter-return programs, the FFV seroprevalence was 75.0% in Southern California, 52.4% in Colorado, and 41.9% in Florida. Among pumas, the FFV seroprevalence was 69.1% in Southern California, 77.3% in Colorado, and 83.5% in Florida.\n\nThe study on FFV seroprevalence in domestic cats is available at jav.ma/FFVcats, and the study on FFV seroprevalence in pumas is available at jav.ma/FFVpumas. The study on cross-species transmission is available at jav.ma/FFVcross.\n\nAUXILIARY CELEBRATES NATIONAL PET WEEK 2020\n\nThe Auxiliary to the AVMA will be celebrating National Pet Week 2020, May 3-9, with the theme “Pets & Vets the Perfect Duet.”\n\nThe AVMA and the AVMA Auxiliary, a century-old association primarily made up of the spouses of AVMA members, created National Pet Week in 1981 to foster responsible pet ownership, recognize the human-animal bond, and increase public awareness of veterinary medicine.\n\nLast year, the Auxiliary held its annual poster and writing contests to generate promotional materials for National Pet Week 2020. Sophie Casey of Westport, Connecticut, was in 11th grade when she submitted the accompanying artwork that won the poster contest. Madeleine McConnell of Venice, Florida, was in sixth grade when she submitted the following poem that won the writing contest.\n\nPets and Vets the Perfect Duet\n\nThere are so many places to go—\n\nAnd sometimes there isn't much time\n\nYour pet is starting to show\n\nA sickness or an illness kind-of sign.\n\nIt is important for pets and vets\n\nTo have the best relationship needed.\n\nIn order to give a medicine or shot,\n\nThere has to be a friendship that is undefeated.\n\nThe duet is filling the air with joy.\n\nAs a veterinarian watches the dog wiggle.\n\nHe or she gives the pet a toy,\n\nAnd everyone in the room giggles.\n\nEveryday a new vet is blessed\n\nWith a pet that was the very best\n\nThey have to come home with the joy all confessed;\n\nAnd that's why pets and vets make the perfect duet.\n\nThe Auxiliary is selling the winning poster for National Pet Week as well as pencils, bookmarks, balloons, and a children's book. The order form is at avmaaux.org/national-pet-week/shop.\n\nDetails about the poster and writing contests for National Pet Week 2021 are available at avmaaux.org/national-pet-week/contests. The theme will be “Love is a 4-Legged Word.” June 14 is the postmark deadline. The contests are open to students in kindergarten through 12th grade.\n\nVETERINARY STUDENTS CAN APPLY FOR AVMF SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nThe application period is now open for a number of scholarships for students attending AVMA Council on Education-accredited veterinary colleges.\n\nStudents can submit applications for the following scholarships from March 1-May 15:\n\n• AVMA/AVMF Scholarship for Veterans: In honor of the 100th anniversary of President Woodrow Wilson's signing of the National Defense Act of 1916 and the creation of a Veterinary Corps within the U.S. Army, the AVMA and AVMF established a special scholarship for military veterans pursuing an education in veterinary medicine.

Scott Nolen\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2019, Drs. Kate Toyer and Tara Cashman sat down with their three kids and reviewed their escape plan.\n\nThe bushfires that had been burning for weeks were now threatening to overtake Batemans Bay, a coastal town in New South Wales, Australia, where the family lives and the veterinarians run a small animal clinic.\n\nThey had packed the car a month ago with food, water, and a few other essential items—enough for the family members and their cat to live a short time away from home.\n\nThe calls came at 6 the next morning: Evacuate now.\n\n“We weren't even asked to go to the evacuation center in town but to go straight to the beach,” said Dr. Cashman, explaining they did, in fact, drive 6 miles to an evacuation center because of the better facilities. “Thankfully, that was the right decision because the fires were so bad that those who evacuated to the beach actually had to stand in the water.”\n\nFIRE SEASON\n\nFire season in Australia typically begins late in the year during the hot, dry summer when a lightning strike or human negligence sets a tree or patch of grass alight.\n\nBUSHFIRES CLAIM VETERINARIAN'S SON\n\nIan McBeth, son of Dr. William McBeth, a member of the AVMA Food Safety Advisory Committee, was killed with two other Americans in a plane crash during a firebombing mission on Jan. 23 in Australia.\n\nMcBeth, 44, was piloting a C-130 Hercules loaded with flame retardant when the airtanker crashed around 1:30 p.m. in the Snowy Monaro area of southern New South Wales.\n\nMcBeth was working for Coulson Aviation, which provides aerial firefighting services worldwide. In a statement, Coulson said the accident was reported to be extensive.\n\nDr. McBeth told JAVMA News his son deployed to Australia on Dec. 28. 2019, for a tour that was scheduled to end Jan. 24.\n\nMcBeth was an experienced aerial firefighter with years of experience flying C-130s for the military and Coulson Aviation. He served with the Wyoming Air National Guard and Montana Air National Guard.\n\n“Ian was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times, but firefighting was what he was good at and enjoyed doing. It's a complex task. You have to be an expert pilot and navigate difficult terrain and weather,” Dr. McBeth said.\n\n“I practice in a small town in northeastern Colorado, and Ian grew up in that practice,” he added. “Ian loved working horses and cattle and dogs and cats. Veterinary medicine was a part of his life.”\n\nMcBeth is survived by his wife, Bowdie, and their three children, his parents, William and Anneliese; and his siblings, Rick, Eleanor, and Aislinn.\n\nBushfires are destructive and often deadly. In the southeast state of Victoria, 173 people died during the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 that scorched more than a million acres of land and destroyed over 4,000 homes and other buildings.\n\nThe tragedy, one of the worst in Australia's history, led to the creation of a task force to study all aspects of the government's bushfire strategy. That investigation resulted in several reforms, including early warning alerts similar to the kind Drs. Toyer and Cashman received.\n\nThe changes are widely credited with the relatively low number of human fatalities despite the unprecedented severity of the 2019-20 fire season. At press time in late January, the government reported the fires had killed more than 30 people, burned over 25 million acres, and destroyed roughly 3,000 houses.\n\nMost of the fatalities and property loss occurred in New South Wales, where three American firefighters were killed in a plane crash on Jan. 23, one of whom was Ian McBeth, son of Dr. William McBeth, a member of the AVMA Food Safety Advisory Committee (see sidebar, this page).\n\n“Batemans Bay was hit really hard early on,” said Dr. Toyer, adding that 350 homes were destroyed. “Most of the pictures you see in Western media, of the massive flames and burned-out landscapes, were taken in this area.”\n\nThe clinic Dr. Toyer runs with her partner, Dr. Cashman, was, like their home, damaged but not destroyed. The practice operated off a generator for more than a month.\n\n“The South Coast has just been devastated since New Year's Eve,” said Dr. Julia Crawford, president of the Australian Veterinary Association. She estimates over 200 veterinary practices have been affected, about 90 seriously.\n\nSupport from around the world has been pouring in, including from the AVMA and American Veterinary Medical Foundation as well as other organizations, to support veterinary-and animal-focused relief efforts. The Morris Animal Foundation has allocated $1 million for scientific research grants to fund studies on how the region's wildfires have affected its native animals.\n\n'A MONSTROUS EVENT'\n\nThe most startling news about the bushfires has been the number of animals killed. Chris Dickman, PhD, a professor of ecology, conservation, and management of Australian mammals at the University of Sydney, estimates the fires will kill more than 800 million animals in New South Wales alone and impact a billion animals nationwide. By way of comparison, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimated up to 1 million wild and domesticated animals died during the 2009 Black Saturday brushfires.\n\nAs Dr. Dickman explained in a statement from the university, animals that survive the fires in the first instance by fleeing or going underground will return or reemerge into areas without the resources to support them. Others will fall victim to predators. Even for those birds or other animals able to flee to unaffected areas, they will rarely be able to successfully compete with animals already living there.\n\n“I think there's nothing quite to compare with the devastation that's going on over such a large area so quickly,” Dr. Dickman said. “It's a monstrous event in terms of geography and the number of individual animals affected.\n\n“We know that Australian biodiversity has been going down over the last several decades, and it's probably fairly well known that Australia's got the world's highest rate of extinction for mammals. It's events like this that may well hasten the extinction process for a range of other species. So, it's a very sad time.”\n\nDr. Crawford described Dr. Dickman's estimates as “a fair assessment.”\n\n“I talked to veterinarians who assisted in the animal part of the response early on. They were waiting for injured wildlife to be brought in, but nothing came in,” Dr Crawford said. “We think these fires are so hot and burn so fast that probably 90% of these animals died immediately.\n\n“The deaths are just far more than we ever thought.”\n\nTINDERBOX\n\nHow to explain the catastrophic loss of animal life? How, even with advance warning, were the Australian government and people caught off guard by the severity of the fires?\n\nIn September, the same month the 2019-20 bushfire season started, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a special climate statement warning of elevated fire dangers for New South Wales and the neighboring state of Queensland. Australia is three years into one of the worst droughts in decades. Then, in December, a heat wave broke the record for the highest nationwide average temperature, with some areas reaching up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFUNDRAISING CONTINUES\n\nThe AVMA, American Veterinary Medical Foundation, and VCA Charities have joined forces on a second phase of fundraising to support those impacted by the bushfires ravaging Australia.\n\nAs of the end of January, the AVMA and the AVMF had raised over $125,000 for the Australian Veterinary Association's Benevolent Fund. The AVMF received over $50,000 in individual donations coupled with a $50,000 matching grant from the AVMF, plus an additional $25,000 AVMA donation. Those funds are being sent to the AVA's Benevolent Fund, which provides financial assistance to veterinarians who have lost their own property because of the fires or who have provided charitable care for impacted animals.\n\nA second fundraising effort was announced Jan. 31, driven by a grant from VCA Charities that will match up to $50,000 in additional donations made to the AVMF on behalf of the AVA Benevolent Fund.\n\nVCA Charities had held a fundraiser in January that also was meant to help veterinarians in Australia provide care to affected pets and wildlife. In total, VCA Charities has raised $150,000 and will provide three donations: one to support veterinarians, one to help wildlife, and one to help pets. VCA Charities will match every dollar contributed to the AVMF on behalf of the AVA Benevolent Fund, up to $50,000; 100% of the donations will be directed towards disaster relief efforts in Australia.\n\nTo make a donation, visit avmf.org and use the AVMF code “Disaster Relief—AVA Benevolent Fund.”\n\nTogether, these factors created an environmental tinderbox on a scale unlike anything the country had previously experienced.\n\n“The bushfires this season are unique in that multiple fires are occurring simultaneously and joining up to form superfires,” explained Dr. Robert Johnson, director of Vets Beyond Borders, an Australian nonprofit that runs charitable veterinary programs in regions of Asia and the Pacific.\n\n“We are in the middle of a serious drought in Eastern Australia that has created an extraordinary amount of fuel for the fires,” he said. “What also sets these fires apart from previous ones is the fact that they have affected such a large proportion of populated areas. The amount of acreage burned is about eight times larger than the 2018 Californian wildfires.”\n\nWith fire season expected to continue into the spring, the extent of the destruction is not yet fully understood.\n\n“Everyone's still in response mode,” Dr. Crawford said. The government puts the number of cattle and sheep deaths at more than 23,000, but she expects the final tally will be much, much higher.\n\nWhen the last fire is finally out, Dr. Crawford worries about the economic fallout veterinary practices are sure to experience after months of interrupted services. She explained that Australian veterinarians generally do not charge to treat injured wildlife brought by the public to their clinics. Some practices provide as much as $3,000 in pro bono services weekly.\n\n“That's all fine and well in ordinary times; we enjoy it,” she said. “But after a crisis like this, when your practice is almost burnt down, you're working from a generator, and the only patients you're seeing are wildlife, it becomes problematic from a cost standpoint.”\n\n“It's summer here,” Dr. Crawford added, “and holidaymakers who'd normally bring their pets to these coastal practices aren't coming. Those veterinarians have lost that revenue, and it's just devastating.”\n\nThe country may see relief only temporarily, as conditions that caused the bushfires are predicted to continue, if not worsen, thanks to climate change.\n\nAustralia's climate has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910, leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, according to the Meteorology Bureau's State of the Climate 2018 report. At the same time, there has been a decline of around 11% in April-October rainfall in the southeast of Australia since the late 1990s. As a result, there has been a long-term increase in extreme fire weather and in the length of the fire season across large parts of Australia, according to the report, which can be found at jav.ma/ClimateReport.\n\nAustralia is projected to experience further increases in sea and air temperatures, with more hot days and marine heat waves and fewer cool extremes. Decreases in rainfall across southern Australia with more time in drought are also predicted.\n\nSENATORS URGE NIH TO OBEY LAW AND RETIRE CHIMPS TO SANCTUARY\n\nThree U.S. senators are urging the National Institutes of Health to reverse its decision not to retire nearly four dozen chimpanzees at a biomedical primate facility in New Mexico to a sanctuary as originally promised.\n\nSens. Tom Udall of New Mexico, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico submitted a letter to NIH Director Francis Collins this past December requesting that the agency transfer 43 chimpanzees from the Alamogordo Primate Facility on Holloman Air Force Base to Chimp Haven in Keithville, Louisiana.\n\nStarting in 2013, the NIH began to significantly reduce the use of chimps in agency-supported biomedical research. Ongoing projects were phased out, while no new studies were approved. Two years later, the NIH announced it would no longer fund any chimp-related research and that the roughly 300 chimps the agency owned or supported would be retired to Chimp Haven.\n\nBut last October, the NIH said the remaining chimpanzees at the New Mexico facility were too frail to transfer to Louisiana. “As chimpanzees age, they can develop serious chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. In fact, about half of the NIH chimpanzees are considered geriatric,” Collins explained in an Oct. 24 statement.\n\nThe agency's decision was based on an evaluation of the chimps by a panel of NIH veterinarians that advised the agency that it would be a serious risk to the chimps’ health to move them, he said.\n\n“Accordingly, NIH expects that these 44 chimpanzees (since down to 43) will live out the remainder of their lives at APF to ensure their safety and welfare,” Collins said. “Chimpanzees at APF have indoor/outdoor living conditions in structures called Primadomes that allow them to climb and swing. They have strong dependency on their social groups as well as close bonds with their caretakers, from whom they receive excellent care.”\n\nSens. Udall, Cassidy, and Heinrich view the decision as a violation of the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act mandating that chimpanzees live their remaining years in a chimp sanctuary.\n\n“In addition to our general questions about the NIH's rationale for retaining these chimpanzees that are no longer needed for biomedical research, we are concerned that the NIH's decision may be contrary to Congress's intent in passing the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act (CHIMP Act),” they wrote.\n\nThe NIH, the senators continued, has a legal duty to fulfill its commitment to relocate the chimps to the national sanctuary system. “There, these chimpanzees may live out the remainder of their lives under the supervision of caretakers with expertise in maximizing their psychological and physical wellbeing—precisely as Congress envisioned,” they wrote.\n\nThe senators then requested the NIH answer a series of questions regarding such matters as the number of staff members caring for the chimps, the facility's ability to meet the chimps’ complex physical and psychological needs, and a description of any and all instances in which a chimp has died or has been injured during transport.\n\nQ&A: Veterinarian works to reduce caregiver placebo effect\n\nDr. Brennen McKenzie, also known as the SkeptVet, discusses his new book\n\nInterview by Greg Cima\n\nPeople see the changes they expect in their pets, leading them to misattribute illness, good health, improvements, and declines.\n\nDr. Brennen McKenzie is a companion animal veterinarian working in California, the writer behind the SkeptVet blog, and the author of the recently published book, “Placebos for Pets? The Truth About Alternative Medicine in Animals.” He also is a columnist for Veterinary Practice News and past president of the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association. He wrote a 2014 JAVMA commentary on cognitive bias in clinical decisions (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2014:244;271-276).\n\nIn his book, Dr. McKenzie teaches how to evaluate the theories, methods, evidence, and safety records for myriad complementary or alternative therapies. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. DID YOU WRITE YOUR BOOK WITH A PARTICULAR READER IN MIND?\n\nA. I initially was thinking of it as a resource for pet owners, and I tried to write the book in language that is accessible to the general public. So, I'm hoping that it will be an introduction to the general ideas about how we evaluate medical therapies for pets, what's the appropriate way to do that, what's the role of science in helping us to evaluate these things—and also an appraisal of some of the more common alternative medical approaches that pet owners are likely to encounter. However, I also wanted it to be useful to veterinary professionals. All of the things that I talk about have extensive academic references available so that they can dig deeper if they want.\n\nQ. WOULD YOU RECAP WHY WE'RE ALL SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE CAREGIVER PLACEBO EFFECT?\n\nA. It's a fundamental feature of human cognition, and this is one thing I think all veterinarians should have some familiarity with—the history and philosophy of science and cognitive psychology. We all reason in ways that are kind of built into our brains.\n\nI give a patient a medication, and a week later, that patient's clinical symptoms resolve. I see a causal connection there and assume that the medication is responsible for the change. What we know from science is that it's a lot more complicated than that. We're often doing multiple things at once. Diseases have a natural history where their symptoms wax and wane and can just resolve spontaneously. We may have the wrong diagnosis to begin with, and so when things don't go the way we expect, it's not always because of what we did but because we were wrong about our assumptions.\n\nIt's very difficult for any of us, whether we're veterinarians or not scientifically trained, to ignore our personal experience. And if a study comes out saying something that I've been doing for 10 years and been selling to clients doesn't work, it's difficult psychologically and cognitively for me to accept that my assessment is wrong and that I've been doing the wrong thing.\n\nQ. HOW DO YOU CHALLENGE MISTAKEN BELIEFS AMONG YOUR CLIENTS?\n\nA. It's complicated. One of the primary questions in science education today is, “How do you change people's minds about things?” And we're facing a crisis in terms of vaccine hesitancy (see story, page 530).\n\nAs a clinician seeing patients, I have a few key things that I try to focus on when I want to challenge somebody's perception. The first is I have to acknowledge that I understand their perception and validate their experiences and their reasoning.\n\nIf you begin by telling people that they're ignorant or stupid, they won't listen to you. They may have perfectly rational reasons for a mistaken belief. So you begin by saying, “I understand why you feel that this is a useful approach or why you feel that this therapy has been helpful to you.” And then you introduce some potential reasons to doubt that.\n\nI often talk about other cases in science where we've given up on therapies that clearly don't work anymore. Bloodletting is a great example where we believed in things for long periods of time and found them not to be true.\n\nI also try to say, “OK, let's look at this in terms of risk and benefit.” Glucosamine is a widespread therapy for which there's very little evidence of efficacy, and yet, everyone's using it. I say to people, “Here are the reasons why I don't think it probably works. I also think that the risks are quite low, so I don't feel like it's imperative that you give up that.”\n\nIf you meet people halfway and work with their beliefs and their goals, I think they're more likely to listen to you. Over time, you build a relationship with clients, and they come to trust you, and I think that gives you more credibility to tackle larger and more challenging beliefs.\n\nIt also makes a difference where that belief fits in their life. I'm not going to talk to a client who's a chiropractor and try to convince them that chiropractic is not a valid therapy because that's embedded in their entire life, and that's not going to be a useful or successful interaction.\n\nQ. DO YOU THINK THAT A TYPICAL PERSON WHO USES AN ALTERNATIVE MODALITY UNDERSTANDS THE THEORIES BEHIND THAT PRACTICE?\n\nA. Almost certainly not, no. I think most people don't understand the theories behind the drugs that I give them, either. Most people are not interested in the deep background of medical therapies. What they hear are claims by practitioners of benefits, usually justified in terms of, “I've been doing this for 20 years, and it sure looks to me like it works.” Anecdotal claims tend to be the easiest to offer and the most psychologically compelling, even though they're the least reliable.\n\nThere are certainly some people who have a general worldview that is skeptical of science and technology and the pharmaceutical industry, which has certainly earned a great deal of skepticism. And I think that alternative medicine fits into that worldview. I think also that conventional medicine, particularly for humans, has a lot of serious problems in terms of how we communicate with people, how we manage their lives and their needs. We've become very siloed and segmented into subspecialties and very technologically focused. I think there are a lot of things wrong with how we offer health care to people, and the environments and conversations that alternative practitioners often have with people address a lot of those concerns and those problems. I do think that alternative medicine fits into people's lives in an ideological and philosophical way.\n\nQ. HOW CAN A PET OWNER TELL WHICH STUDIES ARE GOOD, WHICH RESULTS ARE EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHING WORKS?\n\nA. I do offer some fairly simple guidelines in the book. One is that no single study is ever definitive because it's impossible to completely eliminate bias. If there's only one study, you should still be a bit skeptical. Larger studies are better than smaller studies. Any study that does not effectively have a placebo arm and doesn't hide from both the owners of the pets and also the investigators or veterinarians which therapy each pet is getting is probably going to be biased and not reliable. So, there are some very simple rules that you can apply.\n\nI think, honestly, the onus is on veterinarians to be better at understanding how to appraise a clinical trial and then to talk to owners. Even in the absence of large-scale, definitive, high-quality evidence, I do think we can look at these therapies and the reasoning behind them and the evidence for them and make sound, honest recommendations one way or another—that don't just rely on anecdotes.\n\nThere's a method that I try to teach in the book for approaching things, so even if there are things that I don't cover in the book, I hope that it'll be useful to people in terms of finding a structured, reliable way to approach new things.\n\nAs a veterinarian, I'm hearing about new supplements and new therapies all the time, and many of them don't have a lot of research evidence. But I don't think we have to say to our clients, “I don't know, there's nothing I can do, take your best guess.” I think we can use a systematic, science-based approach to help guide and counsel our patients.\n\nAAFP UPDATES GUIDELINES ON FELINE RETROVIRUSES\n\nBy Katie Burns\n\nFeline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus are found in cats worldwide, according to the American Association of Feline Practitioners, but the spread of these viruses can be minimized through education, testing, and vaccination.\n\nIn January, the AAFP released updated Feline Retrovirus Testing and Management Guidelines online and in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery. The association aims to provide the most current information about feline retrovirus infections so veterinary practitioners may optimize the care and management of cats.\n\nThe guidelines represent a consensus of current information compiled by an international panel of researchers and practitioners. The document is an update of the 2008 AAFP Retrovirus Testing and Management Guidelines.\n\nAccording to the guidelines: “Although vaccines are available for FeLV in many countries and for FIV in some countries, identification of infected cats remains an important factor for preventing new infections. The retrovirus status of every cat at risk of infection should be known. Cats should be tested as soon as possible after they are acquired, following exposure to an infected cat or a cat of unknown infection status, prior to vaccination against FeLV or FIV, and whenever clinical illness occurs. It might not be possible to determine a cat's infection status based on testing at a single point in time; repeat testing using different methods could be required. Although FeLV and FIV infections can be associated with clinical disease, some infected cats, especially those infected with FIV, can live for many years with good quality of life.”\n\nThe guidelines cover the pathogenesis and outcomes of infection, diagnosis and prevention of retrovirus infections, considerations for multicat environments, and management of retrovirus-infected cats. A brochure for cat owners describes FIV and FeLV, signs of infection, diagnosis, prevention, and management of infected cats.\n\n“The newly updated guidelines for 2020 describe a two-tier testing system for FeLV and FIV,” said Dr. Julie Levy, co-chair of the guidelines and a professor of shelter medicine at the University of Florida, in comments to JAVMA News. “One approach is ‘one and done,’ in which a reliable point-of-care combination test is performed for FeLV antigen and FIV antibody in cats with relatively low risk. A cat with a negative result is likely to be uninfected. A cat with a positive result is likely to be infected, but it may also be a false positive.\n\n“If resources permit, a second-stage confirmatory tier of testing can be performed.”\n\nDr. Levy's test of choice is a polymerase chain reaction-based test because it is highly sensitive and detects a different part of the virus than the point-of-care tests do. In the case of FeLV, she uses a newly offered laboratory test bundle that includes a highly sensitive microtiter plate test for FeLV p27 antigen and a newly developed quantitative PCR assay. Not only does this test combination confirm infection, Dr. Levy said, but it can also determine whether a cat has regressive or progressive infection, which provides information about prognosis, early death, and risk of shedding virus to other cats.\n\n“Recent research has shown that cats with FIV infection can safely live with uninfected cats if they get along and do not fight, with very little chance of transmission,” Dr. Levy said. “Cats with FeLV, however, should live alone or with other infected cats since the risk of transmission of FeLV is higher. Cats with FeLV and FIV are increasingly managed by adoption, necessitating strong pet owner education and support from their new veterinarians.”\n\nThe guidelines provide the following summary points:\n\n• Retrovirus infections remain common and important diseases of cats worldwide.\n\n• Ongoing research into viral pathogenesis and improvements in diagnostic testing continue to refine the state of knowledge about these viruses.\n\n• Practitioners are advised to take advantage of current peer-reviewed published reviews and recommendations for testing and management of cats in different populations.\n\nBRAKKE STUDY: PET HEALTH PRODUCT SALES MIGRATE TO ONLINE SOURCES\n\nAbout 31% of pet owners are sourcing at least some of their pet health products online, according to a new study from Brakke Consulting Inc.\n\nOn Jan. 13, Brakke Consulting released “Pet Health Products: Changing Channels.” Based on national surveys of pet owners and veterinarians, the study documents the rapid migration of pet health product sales to online sources.\n\n“Nearly two thirds of veterinary practices (63%) offer online ordering and home delivery, up 16% in the last two years,” according to key findings from the study. “However, client awareness of that service lags. Still, this is a $550-$600 million market being serviced by veterinarians.\n\n“Although 20% of pet owners have ordered products or received refills via home delivery from their vet, an additional 25% would order from the vet if their vet offered the service or they were aware that their vet does already offer the service.”\n\nOnline sales and home delivery for veterinary clinics are primarily handled by three companies: Covetrus, a public company; VetSource, a private firm; and MyVetStore, a service of Midwest Veterinary Supply.\n\nLeading online retailers for pet health product sales include Chewy, Amazon, and 1-800-PetMeds. About 17% of pet owners purchase pet health products online from Chewy, 12% from Amazon, and 9% from 1-800-PetMeds. Online retailers are making their greatest inroads into flea and tick products, heartworm preventives, and therapeutic diets, according to the study.\n\nAnother factor at play in channel use is demographics. Among pet owners age 55 or older, 89% consider the veterinarian to be the most trusted source of information about pets, whereas only 5% say the same about online sources. For pet owners age 18-34, only about half consider the veterinarian to be the most trusted source of information, and 29% put more trust in online sources. Younger consumers also are the most oriented to online purchasing.\n\nVACCINE HESITANCY\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nVeterinary professionals face challenges surrounding vaccinations\n\nDr. Sarah J. Wooten, a small animal veterinarian from Greeley, Colorado, has had first-hand experience with clients who are concerned about vaccinations but says listening to their concerns without judgment may be beneficial.\n\n“People are afraid of what the vaccines may do to their pets,” she said. “The intentions of people that don't want to vaccinate are pure. They just want their pets to be healthy and they're afraid.” Dr. Wooten retired from clinical practice and is now a public speaker and author.\n\nIn recent years, human medicine has faced a growing number of individuals who reject mainstream science regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines. In the same vein, many veterinary professionals say that, increasingly, they are hearing concerns from pet owners regarding the safety or necessity of vaccines for their pets.\n\nMany websites that identify as natural or holistic warn about the dangers of over-vaccination of dogs and cats, but none define what they mean by over-vaccination. All agree, for most vaccines, that annual revaccination is unnecessary, but that is generally consistent with recommendations from the AVMA and other major organizations.\n\nA SCRIPT FOR DISCUSSING VACCINES WITH A CONCERNED CLIENT\n\nDr. Sarah J. Wooten, a small animal veterinarian from Greeley, Colorado, suggests the following script, first published in October 2017 in dvm360 magazine, for veterinarians discussing vaccines with a concerned client.\n\nThe veterinary professional: Bella is due for her vaccines.\n\nClient: I don't want to have Bella vaccinated today.\n\nThe veterinary professional: Can you tell me your main concern with vaccination?\n\nClient: I'm just not interested.\n\n(This is when you need to finesse this conversation a little to get the client to open up.)\n\nThe veterinary professional: No pressure at all. I really just want to know what your concerns are so we can do the best thing for your pet.\n\n(Client may get squirmy or evasive.)\n\nClient: Well, I read that vaccines can cause autism.\n\nThe veterinary professional: Thanks for telling me, and that's a valid concern.\n\n(Client usually appears surprised and relieved at this point.)\n\nThe veterinary professional: You aren't the only person who has heard that. When I heard about the study, I researched it myself, because I was worried about my pets. What I found is that the British study that linked autism to vaccines, the one that scared all the parents, was retracted about six years ago because the study was proven false. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published a resource center that goes into great detail about the safety of vaccines if you'd like more information.\n\nInfectious disease control represents a major part of our effort as your pet's health care providers. Vaccines are better studied than any other medicine we prescribe, and the manufacturers guarantee their safety and efficacy.\n\nThe vaccines we recommend are the vaccines we think your pet needs. I made sure my pet got these vaccines, and if Bella were my pet, I would be getting these vaccines for her to make sure she is as safe and healthy as she can be. Is that OK?\n\n(Hopefully, at this point the client nods head and smiles. She might even say …)\n\nClient: Thank you for explaining that. And not thinking I was crazy.\n\nThe veterinary professional: Of course. I know you want the best for your pet. You and I want the same thing. It's my job to help you with these concerns.\n\n“In 16 years of practice, using this approach, I never had anybody say no to the core vaccines after that discussion because however emotionally attached they were to their position beforehand, when they actually saw all the pros and cons of it, they realized it's probably just better to get this thing done,” Dr. Wooten said.\n\nUsed with permission from dvm360.com\n\nSome of these same sites warn about the potential long-term harms of over-vaccination, especially the potential for immune-mediated disease and cancer, but none provide any information on the specific types of diseases and cancers they associate with over-vaccination or the incidence. And none provide any data proving a cause-and-effect relationship between over-vaccination and these long-term concerns.\n\nStill, in 2019, only 66% of dog, cat, and rabbit owners in the U.K. said their pet had its primary vaccinations when young, compared with 84% in 2016, according to the PDSA Animal Wellbeing Report, an annual analysis of overall pet well-being in the U.K.\n\nHowever, despite this apparent increase in the reluctance to vaccinate their pets, most pet owners are willing to discuss the issue and just want their concerns to be heard and validated, according to veterinarians with whom JAVMA News spoke.\n\nThe trend has not gone unnoticed. The World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top global threats in 2019, and the theme of the World Veterinary Association's 2019 World Veterinary Day was the “Value of Vaccination.”\n\nCURRENT EFFORTS\n\nThe World Small Animal Veterinary Association has also observed the increase in hesitancy among clients and is surveying companion animal veterinarians about the issue to better understand the phenomenon. The association defines vaccine hesitancy as a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services.”\n\nDr. Michael Day, chairman of the WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines Group, said lower herd immunity is one of the biggest concerns around this issue, as it means that well-controlled infectious diseases might become problematic again.\n\n“As I travel the world speaking to veterinarians about vaccination, it is clear that vaccine hesitancy is of great concern to our colleagues in practice,” Dr. Day said. “Interestingly, the phenomenon appears to exist in both mature and developing veterinary markets.”\n\nDr. Day is emeritus professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Bristol, U.K., and adjunct professor of veterinary pathology at Murdoch University in Western Australia.\n\n“These are difficult discussions for any veterinarian to have with clients who may firmly believe that vaccines are a potential danger to their pets,” he said. “Veterinarians need to adopt a nonconfrontational but persuasive communication style to convey correct, science-based information in an understandable fashion.”\n\nTo facilitate that conversation, the AVMA has several vaccination-related resources available for pet owners at jav.ma/VxResources. AVMA members can also download a handout version of the materials at jav.ma/Vaccinations.\n\nThe WSAVA group also developed a resource document intended for owners and breeders. The document discusses infectious disease, the immune system, vaccination, and vaccination protocols and is available at jav.ma/WSAVAguidelines (PDF).\n\nWSAVA created the vaccine hesitancy online survey for companion animal veterinarians to understand better why owners decline vaccination for their animals, even when vaccines are affordable and readily available. It closed at the end of January for analysis; the data will be released publicly in September.\n\nTHE CONVERSATION\n\nDr. Catherine M. Brown, Massachusetts state epidemiologist and public health veterinarian, has received calls about vaccine hesitancy from veterinarians as well as questions about it at veterinary conferences.\n\n“I think it is something that everybody is struggling with, and they want to provide good guidance for their clients. They don't want to coerce them but they also want to make sure the animal gets everything that is appropriate,” Dr. Brown said.\n\nShe said the exposure risk for rabies, specifically, varies across the United States and depends on what variant of the virus is circulating in the area. But there is always a chance that any individual animal could come into contact with an infected wild animal.\n\nShe added that it is important to note that the U.S. has eliminated the dog variant of the rabies virus from circulation.\n\n“It (rabies) is not in your face as much and therefore people—all of us, veterinarians and the public—sometimes forget what a significant risk rabies still can be,” Dr. Brown said. “I think we're seeing the same thing in human medicine with measles, mumps, and rubella. We see them a lot less frequently so people feel like, ‘Why do I have to vaccinate?’ And to be fair, I think it's a reasonable question to ask.”\n\nDr. Brown said she usually speaks to people about the risk of rabies and other diseases, as well as shares data on the safety of vaccines. She noted that there are potential adverse effects for any vaccine but that the number of animals that react poorly to the vaccine is small.\n\nDr. Wooten agrees that sharing information while also trying to understand the client's perspective helps. For example, a pet owner may say they don't want autism in their dog or cat and that they're more afraid of autism than of distemper, parvovirus, or rabies.\n\n“I think the main thing is accepting where the pet parent is at, even if they are on a different planet than you,” Dr. Wooten said.\n\nShe suggests asking a pet owner about why they have such beliefs and where they got the information.\n\n“It can be something like: ‘You are as much a decision-maker about your pet's health as I am. Tell me more about why you think that. Tell me more about where you got that information.’ And then, just shut your mouth and listen. … I find when you give people a chance to share their piece, to share their knowledge— even if it's erroneous—they feel heard, they feel validated, they feel respected. And then, if you ask for permission to share what you know about vaccine safety, efficacy, and the diseases they protect against and you allow the pet parent to make the decision based on all of that information, then you've done your part.”\n\nON THE BOOKS\n\nLegally, pet owners in some states are required to vaccinate their dogs and cats against rabies. Some states prescribe a specific interval, while others refer to the label of the vaccine used or the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control. Some states do provide exemptions to their vaccination requirements if medically necessary as determined by a veterinarian.\n\nThe AVMA has compiled a summary of the various state laws on rabies vaccination, which is available at jav.ma/StateRabiesLaws (PDF).\n\nImportantly, although owners may be legally required to vaccinate their animals against rabies, other vaccines may not be required by law.\n\nThe WSAVA global vaccination guidelines list core vaccines for dogs as those that protect against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, and the variants of canine parvovirus type 2. Core vaccines for cats include those that protect against feline parvovirus, feline calicivirus, and feline herpesvirus-1, according to the WSAVA global guidelines for the vaccination of dogs and cats, released in January 2016. The Vaccination Guidelines Group recognizes that particular countries will identify additional vaccines that they consider core.\n\nThe American Animal Hospital Association updated its canine vaccination guidelines in 2017 and 2018. The guidelines are developed by the AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines Task Force and are at jav.ma/aahavax. The American Association of Feline Practitioners also has cat-specific vaccination guidelines at jav.ma/AAFPvax.\n\nCONTINUED CHALLENGES\n\nAs the industry continues to face challenges around this topic, veterinary students are learning about how to speak to clients about vaccination.\n\nDr. Christopher R. Lea, an assistant clinical professor at Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine, tries to include communication skills in the curriculum, including how to discuss vaccines.\n\n“Twenty years ago, people never asked me about that. Now, people are more educated about vaccines, and they will ask more about safety and about risk,” Dr. Lea said. “We are trying to train our veterinarians to be educated about that and be able to answer those questions.”\n\nDr. Lea is one of two faculty members who direct Auburn's Veterinary Clinic, designed to provide preventive and wellness care for animals while providing fourth-year veterinary students with the educational experience of running a community practice.\n\nHe said when people come into the veterinary clinic who are hesitant to vaccinate, the students and veterinarians do their best to communicate their expertise.\n\n“Sometimes they take our recommendations, and sometimes they don't,” Dr. Lea said. “At the end of the day, they'll make the decision for their cat, and you know, at that point we tell students, ‘You make your recommendation, and if they choose not to do that, you make some sort of medical record that it was discussed and declined, and then you move on.'”\n\nDr. Wooten believes that education and an open dialogue are key to curbing vaccine hesitancy.\n\n“I think the main thing that we need to address is a combination of misinformation, usually from the internet, and then fear,” Dr. Wooten said. “You have to be open and curious about where that person is coming from.”\n\nPeople: AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF FELINE PRACTITIONERS\n\nEVENT\n\nAnnual conference, Oct. 31-Nov. 3, San Francisco\n\nPROGRAM\n\nThe conference, held during the 5th World Feline Veterinary Conference, focused on complex disease management. Attendees included 1,171 veterinarians, 166 veterinary technicians, 42 practice managers and hospital team members, 58 students, and more than 250 exhibitors and guests. On offer were educational sessions, including scientific research posters and oral abstract presentations; a feline-friendly handling laboratory; and opportunities to network with colleagues on feline medicine.\n\nAWARDS\n\nJournal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 20th Anniversary Award\n\nDr. Sally Lester (Washington State ‘67), Lake Stevens, Washington, for exceptional contributions to the journal in advancement of veterinary health care for cats around the world during the last two decades.
