You may also type a name into the \"Search\" bar (in the main navigation at the top of the page) to search the Board's site (including newsletters and meeting minutes) for references to disciplinary/enforcement actions.\n\nDisclaimer: Every effort has been made to ensure that the enforcement information is correct. However, this information should not be relied upon without verification from the Board office. It should be noted that the names of companies and individuals listed may be similar to the names of the parties who have not had enforcement actions taken. Also, the issuance of an order does not in itself imply that the conditions of the order have been met nor that the individual or firm listed currently holds a license or permit with the Board. To confirm current license or permit status, see âFind a CPA and Find a CPA Firm.\n\nDisciplinary and enforcement orders are public data and copies may be obtained by contacting the Board office or by download from the Board's website (as PDF files)."
