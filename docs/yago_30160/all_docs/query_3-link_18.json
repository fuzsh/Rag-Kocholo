Huge shoutout to The Sketch Effect for capturing a powerful day through illustration. #lovebeyondwalls\n\nTwo years ago today, after a doctor‚Äôs appointment, I was told it would be a year to a year and a half before I could walk again. I was devastated. I wrestled with grief, anxiety, and the trauma from this unexpected tragedy. Almost a year after I was preparing to lose my father üôèüèæ Fast forward, I have since completed my PhD, became a director/professor, wrote two books (one with my daughter) with one forthcoming in 2025 called, From Dropout to Doctorate, received one of the biggest partnerships to date to advocate on behalf of the unhoused through Love Beyond Walls and can walk up to 6 miles at a time now. I don‚Äôt know where you are, but please do not give up. This is not my comeback story anymore, this is my God never left story. P.S. In 8 days, I will celebrate 18 years of marriage with my best friend Cecilia Lester, and something special is loading.\n\nThis morning, I shed a few tears after hitting send on the email! I have officially submitted a 71,000-word draft of part of my life story, with the working title, ‚ÄúFrom Dropout to Doctorate.‚Äù I wrote it during one of the heaviest grieving periods of my life. I hope this book inspires those labeled as coming from the wrong side of the tracks to rise above every stat stacked against them. Book five is loading. Never give up! #lovebeyondwalls"
