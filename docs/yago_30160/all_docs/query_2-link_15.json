Substance use is also significantly more prevalent. However, even though individuals with SCI usually have contact with health care professionals, these mental health disorders are often not recognized and therefore often not addressed optimally, perhaps because of the other more obvious physical health impairments caused by SCI and the stigma that surrounds mental health disorders.\n\nThis clinical practice guideline (CPG), which has been in development for over 15 years, is long overdue. Fortunately, however, during this time, progress has been made in recognizing the extent of the problem and beginning to evaluate potential treatments. This CPG has been rigorously developed with the thought that implementable things can be done to improve the recognition and treatment of mental health disorders, specifically depression and anxiety, PTSD, substance use disorders, and suicide prevention. It is anticipated that this important and practical work will educate clinicians about the scope of the problems and raise awareness about the availability of the means to accurately diagnose and treat these disorders.\n\nWe are fortunate to have the representation of all the various stakeholders in the development and peer review of this CPG, including all of the subspecialists who are impacted by these recommendations, ranging from experts in psychiatry and psychology to rehabilitation professionals. We hope that this wide-ranging representation will translate into uniform quality practice through the widespread use of this CPG to guide the detection and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders in all settings, which can only result in the best outcomes and least amount of morbidity and mortality for individuals who experience SCI.\n\nOn behalf of the consortium steering committee, I want first to acknowledge the leadership of the Chair, Charles Bombardier, in guiding this panel inexorably through the seemingly unending development process over the past decade. Next to be commended are the panel members themselves for keeping to task, even as many have retired along the way, and the many reviewers who provided valuable feedback from all areas. All these people, including the panel Chair, have volunteered their time to help produce this superb document. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the ongoing support of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, especially President David Zurfluh, Executive Director Carl Blake, and Director of Research and Education Cheryl Vines, as well as the rest of the leadership team without whose support these guidelines would not exist.\n\nThomas Bryce\n\nChair\n\nConsortium for Spinal Cord Medicine\n\nForeword\n\nThis clinical practice guideline (CPG) has had a long gestation period. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those who long ago envisioned and nurtured the idea of a broad psychosocial CPG that would further define and elevate standards of care for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In March 2003, Lester Butt, PhD, presented a 5-phase proposal to the Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine (“the Consortium”) to develop a psychosocial CPG. The proposal called for the establishment of a psychosocial workgroup led by Dr. Butt and joined by Helen Bosshart, LCSW, ACSW; Bob Sontag, MSW; Hugh Taylor, MSW; Pat Tracy, MSW; Chuck Bombardier, PhD; Scott Richards, PhD; and Dan Rohe, PhD. Don Kewman, PhD, and Romel Mackelprang, DSW, were identified as topic champions for the CPG. Dr. Butt and colleagues constructed a compendium of psychosocial issues from which the CPG topics could be chosen. They next developed 2 parallel surveys to identify the most important topics for inclusion in the CPG from the perspectives of individuals with SCI, as well as SCI physicians, psychologists, and social workers. Results of that survey were bundled into a CPG proposal that incorporated psychosocial comorbidities (e.g., pain, substance abuse, traumatic brain injury, diagnoses listed in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-IV]), health/wellness/quality of life (e.g., coping, sexuality, family, aging, compliance), community reintegration, psychosocial treatment approaches, summary, and future directions. The proposed content was recognized by the Consortium as identifying important aspects of psychosocial care for individuals with SCI; however, the comprehensive nature of the proposal was felt by the Consortium to be overly ambitious and consequently impractical, given available time and resources. In 2005, the Consortium unsuccessfully sought support from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Evidence-based Practice Centers, to complete the literature reviews and evidence grading for the psychosocial CPG. In 2008, Don Kewman, Lester Butt, and I met to discuss potential ways forward. During that meeting, we decided to take a “Swiss cheese” approach and identify smaller, doable, but still meaningful psychosocial domains that could be the subject of several separate CPGs. The topic of sexuality had already been selected as a stand-alone CPG topic. Ultimately, the group decided to focus the second psychosocial CPG on common disorders in the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV that were prevalent in SCI: depression, anxiety/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use. We reasoned that these conditions were not only prevalent, but they were clinically important, clearly defined, and the subject of considerable research that could inform care and could benefit from a guideline to elevate and enhance current standards of care. In about 2010, I took over the leadership of the revised CPG. The Consortium approved of the more narrowly focused CPG proposal, but other new and revised CPGs were already in the pipeline and so a start date was deferred. The Great Recession, limited resources, and more urgent emerging priorities delayed the commencement of this CPG until 2016. Still, the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) and their CPG directors and managers proved their mettle by sustaining the CPG program through difficult times and kept their commitment to see this CPG through to completion.\n\nI am deeply grateful to the PVA for financial and institutional support. I am especially thankful for the PVA staff who have guided and enabled the development of this CPG over the years: Kim Nalle, Lana McKenzie, Christina Arenas, Caryn Cohen, Kera Lawson, Rita Obi, and Cheryl Vines, as well as PVA consultant J. Paul Thomas. Consortium chairs Larry Vogel and Tom Bryce have been ardent supporters of psychosocial research and this CPG. The methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center, Oregon Health & Science University, led by Shelly Selph, MD, MPH, along with Jessica Griffin, MS, and Ryan C. Stoner, PhD, produced an excellent systematic review of the literature and responded to comments and additional requests in a very collegial manner. I am also thankful for the Veterans Administration/Department of Defense guidelines on treating depression, substance use disorders, tobacco use, PTSD, acute stress disorder, and suicide management, which we have quoted heavily. These and other guidelines have formed the basis for many of the recommendations that we have provided where relevant information from individuals with SCI is lacking.\n\nI also want to recognize at least a few of the pioneering researchers who embraced an empirical approach to understanding psychosocial aspects of SCI: Fiona Judd, Roberta Trieschmann, J. Scott Richards, Robert Frank, Timothy Elliott, Ashley Craig, Paul Kennedy, James Krause, Bryan Kemp, and Denise Tate. These individuals and their colleagues modeled evidence-based approaches and produced an early foundation of empirical support on which to base assessment and treatment practices. They inspired me and the next generation of psychosocial researchers to build on what they had discovered. No CPG provides final answers. May this CPG point us toward a higher standard of care for now, eventually to be challenged, updated, and replaced with better information, more effective methods, and improved standards of care. This is what individuals living with SCI deserve from us.\n\nCharles H. Bombardier, PhD\n\nPanel Chair\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nParalyzed Veterans is proud to sponsor the development and dissemination of the SCI CPGs. For over twenty five years we have partnered with the Consortium of Spinal Cord Medicine in a shared mission to improve the health of individuals living with SCI. Today, hundreds of thousands of copies of the guidelines are used around the world by physicians and other medical professionals who provide care to individuals living with SCI at every level, from the emergency department to acute care, rehabilitation to community services.\n\nWe thank Dr. Bombardier for his leadership and perseverance in guiding this important new guideline into practice. Sincere thanks is also extended to each of the panel members who worked tirelessly, without remuneration, to bring this project to fruition. Dr. Thomas Bryce and the members of the SCI Consortium have provided vision, leadership and support bring this and many other clinical practice guidelines to completion. Their efforts and those of the field reviewers assure the high quality of the recommendations.\n\nAs with any project of this magnitude, many were involved in the process. Sincere appreciation goes to Dr. Shelly Selph and her team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center, Oregon Health and Science University, who conducted the review of literature and methodology for this guideline.\n\nWithin Paralyzed Veterans, work on this guideline benefitted from the efforts of nearly every department. But special appreciation goes to our graphic designers Jonathan Franklin and Kevin Johnson.\n\nFinally, it is only with the significant, mission-driven support of Paralyzed Veterans, our leadership and our members, that we are able to provide these services. Sincere thanks to Paralyzed Veterans President David Zurfluh, Past President Al Kovach, Executive Director Carl Blake and Deputy Executive Director Shaun Castle for their support.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nASD\n\nAcute Stress Disorder\n\nAUDIT-C\n\nAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption\n\nBDI\n\nBeck Depression Inventory\n\nCAGE-AID\n\nCAGE Adapted to Include Drugs\n\nCBT\n\ncognitive behavioral therapy\n\nCDC HRQOL-14\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Health-Related Quality of Life Measure\n\nCPG\n\nclinical practice guideline\n\nCRAFT\n\nCommunity Reinforcement Approach and Family Training\n\nC-SSRS\n\nColumbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n\nDoD\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nDSM\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n\nDSM-IV\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition\n\nDSM-5\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition\n\nFDA\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nFIM\n\nFunctional Independence Measure\n\nGAD\n\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\n\nGAD-7\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale\n\nGRADE\n\nGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\n\nHADS\n\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\n\nMAT\n\nmedication-assisted treatment\n\nMBC\n\nmeasurement-based care\n\nMDD\n\nmajor depressive disorder\n\nNPV\n\nnegative predictive value\n\nOAHMQ\n\nOlder Adult Health and Mood Questionnaire\n\nPC-MHI\n\nPrimary Care-Mental Health Integration\n\nPD\n\npanic disorder\n\nPHQ\n\nPatient Health Questionnaire\n\nPHQ-2\n\n2-item Patient Health Questionnaire-2\n\nPHQ-4\n\n4-item Patient Health Questionnaire-4\n\nHQ-9\n\n9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9\n\nPPV\n\npositive predictive value\n\nPROMIS\n\nPatient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System\n\nPTSD\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder\n\nPVA\n\nParalyzed Veterans of America\n\nQUIPS\n\nQuality in Prognostic Studies\n\nRCT\n\nrandomized controlled trial\n\nSAMHSA\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n\nSBIRT\n\nScreening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment\n\nSCI\n\nspinal cord injury\n\nSCID DSM-III-R\n\nStructured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised\n\nSCID DSM-IV\n\nStructured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition\n\nSCI-QOL\n\nSpinal Cord Injury-Quality of Life\n\nSF-36\n\n36-Item Short Form Health Survey\n\nSNRI\n\nserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor\n\nSSRI\n\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\n\nSUD\n\nsubstance use disorder\n\nTAPS\n\nTobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medication, and Other Substance Use\n\nTBI\n\ntraumatic brain injury\n\nTICS\n\nTwo-Item Conjoint Screening test\n\nVA\n\nUnited States Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nZung SDS\n\nZung Self-Rating Depression Scale\n\nConditions Covered\n\nAD\n\nAnxiety disorders\n\n• GAD\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\n\n• PD\n\nPanic disorder\n\nMDD\n\nMajor depressive disorder\n\nSUDs\n\nSubstance use disorders\n\nPTSD\n\nPosttraumatic stress disorder\n\nASD\n\nAcute stress disorder Suicide\n\nGrading of the Recommendations\n\nThe overall objective of this guideline is to improve the care of individuals with SCI by guiding clinicians and policy makers with its recommendations. The following recommendations use available evidence and—where evidence is limited—panel experience and consensus. The panel based its evidence ratings primarily on research in which the focus of the study was SCI. This information was supplemented by using evidence from trials, guidelines, and expert opinions contained in the scientific literature of non-SCI populations.\n\nNomenclature for Rating of Evidence and Strength of Panel Agreement\n\nFor individual patients, decisions are best made by considering these recommendations combined with clinical judgment, the latter based on specific knowledge about each patient’s risk factors, the potential for adverse effects, and the availability of various options within one’s center. The bracketed rating refers to the level of scientific evidence, the strength of the evidence, and the level of panel agreement with the recommendations ( –).\n\nTable 2.\n\nLevelDescriptionIEvidence based on randomized controlled clinical trials (or meta-analysis of such trials) of adequate size to ensure a low risk of incorporating false-positive or false-negative results.IIEvidence based on randomized controlled trials that are too small to provide Level I evidence.

The first mental health guideline, published in 1998, focused exclusively on depression after SCI. We now know that a number of mental health disorders and SUDs are prevalent and contribute to additional suffering and disability in individuals with SCI.3 Therefore, this guideline focuses on recognition and treatment of the most common mental health conditions in SCI: depression, anxiety, PTSD, and SUDs. The guideline also includes specific sections on detection and management of suicide because of the elevated risk of completed suicide among individuals living with SCI.\n\nThis CPG was designed for SCI rehabilitation professionals who are not mental health specialists a well as for those who are. Therefore, we need to begin with foundational concepts such as how mental health disorders and SUDs are defined. According to the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the 5th edition (DSM-5) published in 2013, mental illnesses are “health conditions involving changes in thinking, emotion or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities.”4 SUDs occur when the use of substances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and opioids) cause significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home.4 In the DSM-5, mild, moderate, and severe SUDs replace the diagnoses of substance abuse and substance dependence found in the 4th edition of the DSM (DSM-IV).5\n\nMental health and SUDs are common in the general population and even more so in individuals with SCI. Each year, 1 in 5 Americans is affected by mental illness and 1 in 12 by an SUD. There is evidence to suggest that individuals with SCI are at greater risk of mental illness and substance use. Estimates of depression in the first year after SCI range from 20% to 40%.3,6 Estimates range from 13% to 40%7–10 for anxiety disorders following SCI. Between 25% and 96% of individuals with SCI used alcohol prior to injury and 32% to 35% used illegal drugs.11 Suicide is the cause of SCI in 0% to 6.8% of cases and is reported to be the cause of death in 5.8% to 11% of decedents with SCI.12 Comorbid mental illnesses and SUDs aversely influence SCI-related symptoms such as pain, as well as functioning, level of independence, community participation, quality of life, and mortality.3 Yet, mental health and SUDs seem to be underrecognized and undertreated in individuals with SCI.13,14 Under-recognition may occur because SCI is a catastrophic injury that blurs the lines between normal emotional responses and mental health disorders. Undertreatment may stem from poor recognition, as well as a failure to use rehabilitation as a window of opportunity to intervene in mental health and SUD conditions. Treatment of mental illness and SUDs is becoming more integrated into regular medical15 and trauma care.16 This is a trend that should be followed in SCI rehabilitation because it can be more effective17 and consistent with mental health treatment preferences in individuals with SCI.18 Consequently, we hope that consumers of this guideline—professionals, students, individuals with SCI and their loved ones—find a document that answers practical questions regarding the prevalence and risk factors for these disorders, how to screen for and assess these conditions, and what can be done to treat mental illness and SUDs, especially within rehabilitation settings.\n\nThis CPG does not address other psychological concepts such as adjustment, grief, resilience, coping, and so forth except to the extent that these variables are related to the included mental health conditions. While these other psychological factors may be important, they were judged to be too expansive and to lack consensus definitions to be included in this CPG.\n\nThe Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine\n\nThe Consortium is a collaboration of professional and consumer organizations funded and administered by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). The Steering Committee, administratively supported by the PVA’s Research and Education Department, is made up of 1 representative from each Consortium-member organization. The Consortium’s mission is to direct the development and dissemination of evidence-based CPGs and companion consumer guides. This mission is solely directed to improving the health care and quality of life for individuals with SCI.\n\nSummary of Guidelines Development Process\n\nThe development of these guidelines involved the following major steps: creating a list of formal questions to be addressed, systematic searches of published literature related to these questions, critical appraisal of the quality of the retrieved studies, abstraction of relevant study results, creation of evidence-based recommendations, writing and revising of various drafts of text that explain the recommendations, and multiple reviews by panel members and outside organizations. The Consortium’s CPG development process also involved extensive field review and a legal review.\n\nMethodology\n\nLiterature Search\n\nA medical librarian searched Ovid MEDLINE (through August 22, 2016), PsycINFO (through July, 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through July, 2016), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through August 17, 2016) by using search terms related to chronic SCI. See Appendix A for complete search strategies. We also attempted to identify additional studies through hand searches of reference lists of included studies and reviews. All citations were imported into an electronic database (Endnote X7, Thomson Reuters).\n\nStudy Selection\n\nSelection of included studies was based on inclusion criteria created in consultation with the PVA. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts of citations identified through literature searches for inclusion by using the criteria below. Full-text articles of potentially relevant citations were retrieved and assessed for inclusion by both reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Results published only in abstract form were not included because inadequate details were available for risk of bias assessment; we did consider for inclusion those abstracts that had additional information available in the form of slide sets from conference presentations, or those that provided supplemental data from published studies. When the data were sparse, we included studies conducted in countries that are less similar to the United States (e.g., Iran, Taiwan) and studies with smaller sample sizes (e.g., less than 100). See Appendix B for a list of included studies and Appendix C for a list of excluded studies.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\nIn consultation with the PVA, we formulated 8 key questions. Key questions and inclusion criteria are as follows.\n\nKey Questions\n\nWhat is the prevalence of common mental health disorders and SUDs (e.g., MDD, PTSD, GAD, alcohol or other drug dependence, and alcohol or other drug abuse) in individuals with SCI?\n\nWhat are the risks and protective factors for common mental health disorders and SUDs in individuals with SCI?\n\nWhat is the evidence that common mental health disorders and SUDs influence body functions and structures, activities, participation, health, and quality of life in individuals with SCI?\n\nWhat is the evidence that the presence and severity of common mental health disorders and SUDs can be reliably and validly assessed in individuals with SCI?\n\nWhat is the evidence that common mental health disorders and SUDs can be effectively treated in individuals with SCI?

We recorded intent-to-treat results when reported. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and independently checked by a second reviewer. Differences were resolved by consensus.\n\nValidity Assessment (Risk of Bias)\n\nWe assessed the internal validity (risk of bias) of randomized trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews by using predefined criteria. These criteria are based on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (United Kingdom) criteria;19,20 the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines;21 and the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool.22\n\nWe rated the internal validity of each randomized trial on the basis of the methods used for randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, the similarity of compared groups at baseline, loss to follow-up, and the use of intent-to-treat analysis. Observational studies were rated on nonbiased selection, loss to follow-up, pre-specification of outcomes, well-described and adequate ascertainment techniques, statistical analysis of potential confounders, and adequate duration of follow-up. For studies of risk factors, we used the QUIPS tool.22 This tool includes domains on study participants, attrition, measurement of the prognostic factor, statistical adjustment for confounding factors, and appropriate statistical analysis. Systematic reviews were rated on clarity of the review question, specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, use of multiple databases and search for grey literature, sufficient detail of included studies, adequate assessment of risk of bias of included studies, and adequate summarization of primary studies.\n\nTwo reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and differences were resolved by consensus. Studies were rated as “low risk of bias,” “medium risk of bias,” or “high risk of bias” from the presence and seriousness of methodological limitations. Risk of bias assessments for included studies are listed in Appendix D.\n\nStudies that had a significant or “fatal” flaw were rated as having a high risk of bias, studies that met all criteria were rated as a low risk of bias, and the remainder were rated as a medium risk of bias. As the medium risk of bias category is broad, studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses. The results of some studies rated as having a medium risk of bias are likely to be valid, while others are only possibly valid. A fatal flaw is reflected by the failure to meet combinations of items from the risk of bias criteria. An example would be a study with high attrition (e.g., 60%) combined with inadequate handling of missing data, or one in which details of randomization and/or allocation concealment were lacking and there were baseline differences in important prognostic characteristics.\n\nGrading the Quality of Evidence\n\nWe graded the quality of evidence by using the GRADE approach.23–27 Developed to grade the overall quality of a body of evidence, this approach incorporates 4 key domains: risk of bias (includes study design and aggregate risk of bias), consistency, directness, and precision of the evidence. It also considers other optional domains that may be relevant for some scenarios, such as a dose-response association, plausible confounding that would decrease the observed effect, strength of association (magnitude of effect), and publication bias.\n\ndescribes the grades of evidence that can be assigned. Grades reflect the quality of the body of evidence to answer key questions. Grades do not refer to the general efficacy or effectiveness of treatments, for example. Two reviewers independently assessed each domain for each outcome and differences were resolved by consensus.\n\nTable 1.\n\nGradeDefinitionHighHigh confidence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.ModerateModerate confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.LowLimited confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very LowVery little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.\n\nThe quality of the body of evidence was evaluated for each outcome by key question.\n\nData Synthesis\n\nWe constructed in-text tables that show the study characteristics, risk of bias ratings, and results for all included studies. We reviewed studies by using a hierarchy of evidence approach, in which the best evidence is the focus of our synthesis for each question, population, intervention, and outcome addressed. When possible, we pooled study results with meta-analyses by using Stata 14.28\n\nResults\n\nOverview\n\nThe search and selection of articles are summarized in the literature flow diagram ( ). Database searches resulted in 2,927 potentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts and titles, 624 articles were selected for full-text dual review, and 127 studies were determined to meet inclusion criteria and were included in this review.\n\nRecommendations and Rationales\n\nGeneral Cross-Cutting Recommendations\n\n1. Screening, Assessment, And Treatment\n\n1.1 Integrate mental health professionals with education, training, and experience in spinal cord injury (SCI), as well as in general mental health and substance use disorders (SUDs) within comprehensive inpatient and outpatient SCI rehabilitation programs.\n\nRationale\n\nMental health disorders and SUDs are common comorbid conditions in individuals with SCI.10 These conditions can contribute to the overall suffering and disability of individuals with SCI,29,30 adversely affect outcomes,3,13,29–31 increase the costs and reduce the efficiency of rehabilitation,32,33 and lead to premature death.34 It is widely recognized that mental health disorders and SUDs are undertreated generally,35,36 including within SCI rehabilitation. For example, a minority of individuals with SCI are treated for major depression when it is present.13,14 To address mental health treatment disparities, health care organizations are adopting care models wherein screening, assessment, and treatment for mental health disorders and SUDs are integrated into regular health care settings. A good example is the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) program that has demonstrated increased access to care for mental health disorders and SUDs.37 Integrated mental health and SCI rehabilitation care is already the standard in other countries.38 People with SCI can be affected by multiple interacting comorbid conditions (such as traumatic brain injury,39 substance use disorder, other mental health disorders,40 and chronic pain41) as well as distinct adjustment patterns42 and the need to adopt many new SCI-specific health behaviors. Therefore, we recommend that mental health providers have education, training and experience in SCI rehabilitation and in as many of these other areas as possible.43\n\n1.2 Routinely screen all individuals with SCI for mental health disorders, SUDs, and suicide risk as part of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation.\n\nRationale\n\nScreening all patients for common comorbid mental health and substance use issues is justified by the prevalence and impact of these conditions in SCI and by the availability of validated brief screening instruments.10,29,30 Routine screening is also critical to the integration of behavioral health care into other medical care and to overcoming undertreatment.11 Widely adopted effective programs for mental health integration such as collaborative care rely on universal screening for target problems.44 This CPG focuses on depression, anxiety, PTSD, SUDs, and suicide because there is evidence that these conditions are prevalent and disabling in individuals with SCI. Each section provides more specific recommendations regarding the timing of screening, screening measures, and responses to positive screening test results.\n\n1.3 Include current symptoms and pre-injury history in screening and assessment of mental health disorders and SUDs.\n\nRationale\n\nWe also recommend that screening include preinjury history of mental health and substance use problems because individuals with SCI have high rates of pre-injury mental health disorders and SUDs, and a history of these disorders is predictive of post-SCI mental health.10 These investigators found that the odds of having a psychological disorder after SCI were 24 times greater if the individual had been treated for a psychological disorder before the SCI.10\n\n1.4 Refer individuals who screen positive for a mental health disorder or SUD to a mental health professional for a diagnostic assessment and initiation of treatment, if indicated.\n\nRationale\n\nAs noted above, mental health disorders and SUDs are undertreated. A national survey showed that only 32.7% of individuals with mental health disorders or SUDs received adequate treatment, and of the individuals with a SUD, only 28.6% received adequate treatment.45 The VA’s PC-MHI program demonstrated that integrated care resulted in increased access to care37 and treatment initiation.46 In primary care, the collaborative care model of mental health integration led to more than double the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% reduction in depression severity compared with those who were treated with usual care (45% vs. 19%).47 A study of depression treatment preferences in SCI showed that patients tend to prefer depression treatment provided in medical or rehabilitation settings rather than in specialty mental health settings.18 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of collaborative care for depression, pain, and physical inactivity in outpatients with SCI resulted in significantly improved pain interference and reduced depression severity, as well as increased treatment satisfaction among those who received collaborative care versus those who received usual care.48\n\n1.5 Use principles of shared decision making to involve individuals with a mental health disorder or SUD in treatment planning.\n\nRationale\n\nConsistent with the 2001 Institute of Medicine report, Crossing the Quality Chasm,49 clinicians are encouraged to inform their patients regarding treatment options, expected outcomes, and what treatment is available in order to facilitate informed choice and a collaborative decision-making process. These processes are thought to result in better treatment plans and greater patient engagement.49\n\n1.6 Systematically use reliable and valid measures of progress to inform care and adjust treatment for mental health disorders or SUDs.\n\nRationale\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence showing that using repeated outcome assessment and decision rules to adjust treatment improves clinical outcomes, aids recognition of clinical worsening, and highlights residual symptoms that can be a risk factor for relapse.50–52 This approach, called measurement based care (MBC), can also enhance the therapeutic relationship and boost patient adherence and recognition of progress, especially early in treatment.50–52 The Joint Commission recommends the MBC standard (CTS.03.01.09). The VA has invested in MBC by creating a behavioral assessment software program and committing to the adoption of MBC.50\n\n1.7 Refer to follow-up treatment and coordinate care upon discharge or transition to the next phase of care, if indicated.\n\nRationale\n\nMental health conditions and SUDs are often chronic, relapsing conditions that require prolonged treatment, relapse prevention efforts, and ongoing monitoring or rescreening.53,54 Consequently, it is vital to plan for continued treatment across transitions in care such as from inpatient rehabilitation to outpatient rehabilitation.\n\nDisorder-Based Recommendations\n\n2. Anxiety Disorders Background\n\nAnxiety is a normal reaction to SCI, but anxiety can become overwhelming and interfere with daily functioning, consistent with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are characterized by anticipation or worry about future threat and are typically accompanied by symptoms such as muscle tension, vigilance, and cautious or avoidant behaviors. These disorders are persistent (typically lasting 6 months or more); out of proportion to reality (taking cultural and contextual factors into account); and interfere with cognitive, emotional, social, and physical functioning.4 In individuals with SCI, anxiety is often studied generically without specifying diagnostic subtypes. Lack of SCI-specific data and the need for brevity have led to the limiting of this review to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD).\n\nHigh-quality evidence from a meta-analysis of 18 studies shows that the overall weighted prevalence of anxiety symptoms using self-report measures is 27% in individuals with SCI.55 Longitudinal studies indicate that anxiety does not necessarily remit over time. However, longitudinal research specifically designed to detect prognostic subgroups revealed 3 patterns of anxiety over the first 2 years following SCI: stable low anxiety, anxiety improvement, and delayed anxiety.42 Two studies that used diagnostic interviews to identify specific types of anxiety found that the prevalence of GAD was 5%, as was the prevalence of PD.55 In comparison, the 12-month prevalence of GAD and PD in the general population is 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively.56\n\nAnxiety is closely associated with respiratory symptoms in non-SCI populations57 and may be higher in females.58 High-quality evidence from a Chinese population-based cohort study of 3556 persons with SCI indicated that high Injury Severity Scores (ISS> 16) had an almost two-fold higher risk of anxiety than those with an ISS<16.59 Low-quality evidence suggests that participation in team sports as opposed to individual sports is associated with reduced levels of anxiety.60 Low-quality evidence also indicates that lower income and poorer health are associated with greater anxiety61 and that a sense of coherence and acceptance of the SCI appear to be protective against anxiety.62 Very low-quality evidence indicates that threat or loss appraisal, mental disengagement, behavioral disengagement, focus on emotions, and attachment avoidance are risk factors for anxiety.63 Higher anxiety is associated with greater odds of having pain and impaired occupational independence 10 and with lower gains in functional independence (motor scores on the Functional Independence Measure [FIM]).64\n\n. See below\n\nTable 5.\n\nA. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptom having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): 1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. 2. Being easily fatigued. 3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. 4. Irritability. 5. Muscle tension. 6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).F. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.:\n\nanxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder\n\nnegative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia],\n\ncontamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder,\n\nseparation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder,\n\nreminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder,\n\ngaining weight in anorexia nervosa,\n\nphysical complaints in somatic symptom disorder,\n\nperceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder,\n\nhaving a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder,\n\nor the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).\n\n. See on page 24\n\nTable 6.\n\nA. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur: Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state. 1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate. 2. Sweating. 3. Trembling or shaking. 4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering. 5. Feelings of choking. 6. Chest pain or discomfort. 7. Nausea or abdominal distress. 8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint. 9. Chills or heat sensations. 10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations). 11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself). 12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.” 13. Fear of dying. Note: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both of the following: 1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”). 2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,\n\nthe panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder;\n\nin response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia;\n\nin response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder;\n\nin response to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder;\n\nor in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).\n\n2.1 Use a brief, valid measure that has good sensitivity to screen all patients for general anxiety and panic disorder (PDs): (a) early during initial inpatient hospital or rehabilitation stay; (b) as a repeat screen if indicated to assess persistence of symptoms or change in status; (c) at the first post-discharge follow-up point; and (d) at future time points depending on risk stratification factors such as prior positive anxiety screening results or preinjury history of psychological disorder.\n\nRationale\n\nMost screening measures of anxiety have not been normed for individuals with SCI and may be confounded by sequelae of the injury itself rather than reflecting anxiety (e.g., shortness of breath, sweating, increased blood pressure, and rapid heart rate). A positive screen therefore may or may not lead to an anxiety disorder diagnosis.\n\nThree anxiety screening measures worth considering are the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),65 the Spinal Cord Injury-Quality of Life (SCI-QOL) Anxiety item bank,66 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7).66,67 The HADS has been used in numerous studies and has an internal consistency of 0.85.68–70 The 25-item SCI-QOL Anxiety scale (fixed-length version or computer adaptive test version, both adapted from and anchored to the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] v1.0 Anxiety bank and metrics) has an internal consistency of 0.95 and is unidimensional.66 All items have adequate or better model fit statistics, good 1-week test-retest reliability (0.80), and negligible differential item functioning. The 9-item short form has an internal reliability of 0.92. The GAD-7 is a 7-item measure of global anxiety developed for use in primary care.67 It was included in the SCI-QOL Anxiety study, which showed a mean GAD score of 3.86 (standard deviation 4.34) in a sample of 465 individuals with SCI. Correlation of the GAD-7 with the SCI-QOL Anxiety instrument wasmoderate (0.67). In primary care patients, a score of 10 or more on the GAD-7 has a sensitivity and specificity for GAD of .89 and .82, respectively.71 At a cutoff of 7 or more, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity and specificity of .82 and .75, respectively, for PD.71 The GAD-7 takes 1–2 minutes to administer, the HADS about 5 minutes, and the SCI-QL full 25 item anxiety item about 7–8 minutes.\n\n2.2 Refer patients with positive screen results or those suspected of having an anxiety disorder to a mental health provider for a diagnostic assessment to assess for conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or PD. Rule out the possibility that the symptoms are better explained by the effects of the medical condition, medications, drugs, the environment, or other factors.\n\nRationale\n\nAs noted above, more than 1 in 4 individuals with SCI are affected by significant self-reported anxiety, which is associated with greater pain and poorer functioning. Mental health conditions tend to be undertreated and under recognized in individuals with SCI.13,14 A positive screen may not lead to a DSM-5 anxiety disorder; conversely, the absence of a positive screen does not rule out an ultimate anxiety disorder diagnosis. The person screening should always refer to a mental health provider if significant anxiety is suspected, particularly since screening items are self-report and can be susceptible to denial or minimization. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for GAD and PD are presented in and because these 2 conditions are relatively common in SCI. GAD requires excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) to have occurred more days than not for at least 6 months about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). In individuals for whom anxiety or other symptoms emerge within 3 months after injury, adjustment disorder with anxious mood (or other subtypes) may be a more appropriate diagnosis. In addition, other post-injury stressors such as care transitions or marital stress, as well as financial, housing, and social insecurity, may trigger an adjustment disorder.\n\nOther differential diagnoses to be considered for GAD include social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Substance/medication induced anxiety disorder also should be ruled out. The DSM-5 manual lists alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedative, hypnotic of anxiolytic medications, amphetamine (or other stimulant), and cocaine as substances which can induce anxiety symptoms.4 Differential diagnoses for PD include dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, asthma, and COPD, although the nature of the association (cause and effect) between PD and these conditions remains unclear.\n\n2.3 To minimize anxiety, support anxious patients with specific and nonspecific therapeutic strategies, provided by all health care professionals (physicians, nurses, therapists, psychologists, social workers, and others) who work with them.\n\nRationale\n\nIndividuals with anxiety may present with unrealistic fears, worries about the future, and avoidance of fear-provoking situations based on their understanding and appraisal of their particular injury and its implications. They may express a heightened need for consistency and control, heavy reliance on staff for reassurance, and even anger when their fears are especially acute. Therefore, it is especially important and sometimes difficult for staff to express core nonspecific relationship factors such as interpersonal warmth, unconditional positive regard, understanding, empathy, and acceptance with these patients,72 and to normalize anxiety-based concerns. Some additional anxiety-specific strategies that rehabilitation team members can implement include the following: (1) provide patients with enhanced informational control (e.g., extra details about the nature of rehabilitation, specifically which therapies, procedures, and medications are used and what they do), (2) increase trust through predictability and maintenance of a stable routine (keep schedule, therapists, nurses, and other aspects of care as consistent as possible and give advance warnings regarding anticipated changes to the team or schedule), (3) provide regular positive feedback and affirm all efforts to participate actively in goal setting and review of progress during therapies and training, (4) gradually expose patients to feared situations and prevent their escape from those situations when possible, (5) stay with patients and maintain a calm demeanor during episodes of high anxiety, (6) encouraging patients to actively engage in decision-making where possible such as determining the schedule for administering psychotropic medications and/or deciding between psychotropic vs. psychological approaches to anxiety management, (7) provide conditions for “errorless learning” to enhance confidence, (8) provide community outings prior to discharge to ease discharge anxiety, and (9) provide patients with extra support around transitions such as discharge from inpatient rehabilitation to manage perceived risks and uncertainties that may seem overwhelming (e.g., make sure follow-up appointments are made and occur soon after discharge, provide “warm hand-offs” and co-treatment if possible between inpatient and future outpatient therapists when possible, give patients a way to contact staff who can answer questions or provide referrals for urgent concerns between discharge and initiation of outpatient care).\n\n2.4 Treat GAD, PD, or other clinically significant anxiety by using pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological interventions based on salient clinical considerations and patient preferences.\n\nRationale\n\nThere is minimal evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatments for GAD or PD in SCI. For treatment of GAD and PD in the non-SCI population, the effectiveness of serotonergic antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are roughly equivalent.73 Therefore, treatment decisions should be based on patient preferences, polypharmacy, medication interactions and potential side effects, and availability from specialized mental health providers.\n\n2.4.1 Consider pharmacological treatment for anxiety, if indicated.\n\nRationale\n\nThere is no evidence for the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety, including GAD or PD, in individuals with SCI. Therefore, we base this recommendation on evidence from other patient populations. For GAD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are considered first-line treatments.73 They are judged to have better combined safety and efficacy compared with alternatives such as tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. The efficacy of different SSRIs and SNRIs is similar.73 Thus, medication choice is based on anticipated side effects, interactions with other medications, and patient treatment history or preferences. Therapeutic dosages of these medications for treating anxiety are similar to those for treating depression. Clinical improvement is expected within 4 weeks on average, but may range from 2 to 6 weeks. There is a case-report indicating that serotonergic agents may exacerbate spasticity.74 In that case, buspirone (for GAD) and pregabalin are considered second-line treatments and are sometimes used to augment treatment when patients have partially responded to maximum dosages of SSRIs or SNRIs.73 Benzodiazepines to simultaneously treat spasticity and anxiety have fallen out of favor because of the potential for the development of tolerance, dependence and other side effects, and because of the demonstrated effectiveness of other modalities such as baclofen.75 As a result, use of benzodiazepines should be reserved for short-term relief of acute severe anxiety or panic. Beta-blockers and antihistamines have been used for anxiety in other populations, but data do not exist for their use in SCI and potential cardiovascular and anticholinergic side effects, respectively, make their use in SCI problematic.\n\nFor PD, SSRIs are considered the first-line medical treatment.76 Other medications such as SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and benzodiazepines have evidence of efficacy, but are less preferred because of the strength of evidence, side-effect profiles, and abuse potential.76 Chronic use of benzodiazepines is associated with poorer response to CBT and sustained PRN benzodiazepine use is associated with poorer outcomes generally.76 Prescribers should note the dangers of combining benzodiazepines and opioids and the anticholinergic and sedating effects of tricyclic antidepressants when considering the use of either class of drug for anxiety.76 A check on EKG for QTc prolongation due to frequent polypharmacy before selecting treatment including serotonergic agents should be considered, particularly with citalopram or concurrent use of other medications with pro-arrhythmic risk, such as prochlorperazine or methadone. Serotonin syndrome and the possibility of increased spasms and agitation are risks for polypharmacy as well, particularly when combined with indirectly or directly acting sympathomimetic agents.77\n\n2.4.2 Consider nonpharmacological treatment for anxiety.\n\nRationale\n\nThere is very low-quality evidence that CBT improves symptoms of anxiety in individuals with SCI either directly or indirectly through treatment directed at reducing the impact of chronic pain.78,79 There is also very low-quality evidence that physical activity improves anxiety in individuals with SCI.80 However, there are no studies of SCI treated GAD or PD specifically. Drawing from the broader mental health literature, robust evidence shows that CBT is effective in the treatment of GAD81 and PD,76 suggesting that this should be considered a first-line treatment option for patients who are receptive to it and where trained mental health providers are available. For individuals with PD, CBT has the advantage of reducing their risk of relapse compared with individuals treated with medications alone. Outcomes for psychodynamic, supportive, and behavioral therapies for the treatment of GAD are less robust.73 Clinicians should consider using adapted relaxation skills training, depending on the individual’s ability to breathe independently and the level of motor functioning and sensation. Clinicians should also be alert to the possibility of anxiety symptoms leading to avoidance of engagement in social activities and activities outside the home, which could further lead to depression and other negative outcomes. Graded exposure to social and activity situations hierarchically ordered in terms of anxiety symptoms they provoke, can be incorporated into the therapy treatment plan. Modalities like yoga, Taiichi, massage therapy and meditation may be helpful and are currently being offered in the VHA.\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Background\n\nFeelings of sadness and depression are normal reactions to stress and loss. However, when these and associated psychological (e.g., anhedonia, guilt, suicidal ideation), cognitive (e.g., poor concentration), and physical (e.g., insomnia, low energy, anorexia) symptoms become severe, prolonged, and impair daily functioning, treatment for a clinically significant depressive disorder is indicated. See for DSM-5 criteria for MDD. Data from 21 studies show there is high-quality evidence that the prevalence of depression is 22% globally in individuals with SCI and approximately 28% in U.S. veterans with SCI.82\n\nTable 7.\n\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition. 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation). 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month) or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss. In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in an MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in an MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.D. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\n\nTable 7.\n\nA.

The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\n\nThere is high quality evidence that pain and depression are associated in SCI.83 Moderate-quality evidence indicates that risk factors for depression in individuals with SCI include female gender40,61,84,85 and current unemployment or unemployment at injury.84–87 Moderate-quality evidence also suggests that protective factors include increased involvement with life, both socially88,89 and physically,90 and greater time since injury.61,91,92 Other risk factors for depression or increased depression severity include a history of mental illness or substance abuse, current mental illness other than depression, and current abuse of alcohol or illegal substances.88,93–96 One implication of these risk factor studies is that depression often precedes SCI and therefore can be conceptualized and treated as a recurrent mental health condition rather than simply a reaction to SCI.\n\nGeneral prevalence estimates obscure the fact that there are clinically distinct depression subgroup trajectories within the SCI population. Research suggests 3 to 4 trajectory groups: stable low depression, depression improvement, and delayed depression and chronic high depression.42,97 These groups can be identified through repeated screening and can be predicted by individual differences in cognitive appraisals about disability, ways of coping, preinjury mental health history, and grief.42,97\n\nIn addition to the direct suffering caused, depression is associated with multiple poor health outcomes in SCI. A systematic review83 and studies published since89,98,99,100–102,91 provide high-quality evidence that depression and pain are positively associated in the SCI population and that the relationship may be bidirectional. In addition, low-quality evidence suggests that depression is a risk factor for comorbid cardiovascular disease, pressure injuries, urinary tract infections, rehospitalization,103 and unemployment.103–105 Very low-quality evidence indicates that depression predicts other health outcomes, participation, and quality of life.106–107\n\nSee . Pages 29–30\n\n3.1 Screen all individuals with SCI for major depression by using a brief, valid measure that has good sensitivity and specificity: (a) early during the initial inpatient hospital or rehabilitation stay; (b) as a repeat screen if indicated to assess persistence of symptoms or change in status; (c) at the first discharge follow-up point; and (d) at least annually or more frequently, depending on risk stratification factors such as prior positive screening results and chronic pain.\n\nRationale\n\nStudies in SCI populations have demonstrated that depression screening instruments can be reliably and validly administered via self-report or face-to-face interview. Early depression screening is recommended because it helps predict risk for depression 1–2 years after injury.42,97 The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Older Adult Health and Mood Questionnaire have been studied most extensively in SCI (see ).108,109 The SCI-QOL Depression item bank (28 items) is a new measure that was developed specifically for SCI by using the PROMIS metric.110 This measure is unidimensional and has excellent internal consistency (0.95), good 1- to 2-week test-retest reliability (0.83), and adequate or better model fit statistics. A computer adaptive test assessment format is available, as well as a 10-item short form. The SCI-QOL Depression item bank has a correlation of 0.76 with the PHQ-9 and yields greater precision of measurements across scores. Thus far, the SCI-QOL has not been validated against a structured diagnostic interview. The Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale is used throughout the world but lacks validity data in SCI.\n\nTable 8.\n\nStudyScreening MeasureCut PointCriterion MeasureSensitivity %Specificity %PPVNPVPrevalence %NRadnitz et al., 1996114BDI≥18SCID DSM-III-R83.390.850.0*98.1*9.7124Tate et al., 1993115Zung SDS≥55DSM-III-R86.067.042.9*93.8*2330Bombardier et al., 2012111PHQ-9≥10SCID DSM-IV1008036.010010142Bombardier et al., 2012111PHQ-9≥11SCID DSM-IV1008440.010010142Krause et al., 2009116OAHMQ≥11PHQ-989.788.848.4*98.610.7727\n\nAmong the instruments currently available in the public domain, the PHQ-9 is the best-performing measure when tested against an independent DSM diagnosis of MDD in individuals with SCI (see ). The PHQ-9 also has the advantage of widespread clinical use in primary care and other medical settings, ease of use, strong psychometric properties for both screening and treatment monitoring, and items that correspond to those of the DSM-5 criteria for MDD.111,112 Research that uses differential item functioning has shown that somatic symptoms such as insomnia, low energy, and anorexia are not inflated in SCI and should not be discounted when screening for and diagnosing depression, as long as at least one of the cardinal symptoms—depressed mood or anhedonia—is endorsed.113 For greater efficiency, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) can be used as an initial screen. If neither anhedonia nor depressed mood are endorsed, screening can be discontinued, and if either are endorsed at any level, screening should continue with the remaining PHQ-9 items. PHQ item 9 can be added to cover screening for suicidal ideation. The optimal cutoff for detecting major depression with the PHQ-9 during inpatient rehabilitation is 11 or higher, resulting in 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity.111 The specificity of the screening process can be improved if the screener ensures at least one of the cardinal symptoms is endorsed.\n\nSee . Page 30\n\n3.2 Refer patients with positive screen results or those suspected of having a depressive disorder to a mental health provider for a diagnostic assessment.\n\nRationale\n\nOptimally, mental health providers (social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists) will practice within the rehabilitation setting to ensure appropriate continuation of care after discharge. Studies have shown that only a minority of individuals with SCI and depression receive adequate treatment.13,14 For example, Fann et al.13,14 found that only 29% of depressed individuals with SCI received any pharmacotherapy for depression and only 11% received any psychotherapy, with rates of guideline level care at 11% and 6%, respectively. Integrating mental health care into standard medical care (e.g., by implementing a collaborative care model) has been shown to improve outcomes in primary care,47 other chronic diseases,117,118 and SCI care.48\n\n3.3 Follow up on positive screening test results by using a valid diagnostic assessment to confirm conditions such as MDD or adjustment disorder (including sufficient persistence of symptoms and interference with rehabilitation or role functioning) and rule out the possibility that the symptoms are better explained by the effects of the medical condition, medications, drugs, the environment, or other factors.\n\nRationale\n\nDepression screening with measures such as the PHQ-9 may over-diagnose MDD (i.e., false positives) and therefore require diagnostic interviews and/or reassessment after a short period to ensure the person meets diagnostic criteria. Depressive symptoms may arise in a number of contexts, ranging from stressful situations that may be transient (e.g., transitions in care, anniversaries of the injury, financial or housing difficulty) to chronic stressors such as physical disability, chronic medical illness barriers to participation in meaningful or enjoyable activities. Other contributing factors may include medication side effects, delirium, alcohol or drug use, or a comorbid mental health condition (e.g., bipolar disorder, dementia, schizophrenia). Because of this wide range of etiologies and contributors, a thorough history and diagnostic assessment is essential before deciding on a course of action. The differential diagnosis may include grief related to exposure to losses, demoralization, adjustment disorder, MDD, depression secondary to a medical condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury [TBI], pain, hypothyroidism), and delirium (e.g., due to alcohol withdrawal, corticosteroids). In some cases, somatic symptoms of depression may be better explained by the physical or medical effects of SCI. For example, early morning awakening and fatigue that is worst in the morning are more suggestive of depression, while middle insomnia (associated with turns) and fatigue later in the day may be related to SCI. Weight loss with a normal appetite suggests a medical condition. An important consideration when assessing the significance of depressive symptoms is whether they are impairing the individual’s functioning. When a biological or psychosocial cause or contributor to the symptoms can be identified, it should be addressed.\n\nThe use of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria is recommended to guide diagnosis and facilitate shared decision making. Although the presence of MDD typically warrants pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological treatment, adjustment disorder may remit spontaneously or with psychosocial support. However, anyone identified with depressive symptoms (e.g., PHQ-9 score > 5) should be followed to monitor symptom trajectory and determine appropriate management, as adjustment disorders or minor depression can still impair functioning and may evolve into an MDD.\n\n3.4 Support patients with major depression with nonspecific and depression-specific relationship skills, used by all health care professionals (physicians, nurses, therapists, psychologists, social workers, and others) who work with them.\n\nRationale\n\nBecause of the multiple medical and psychosocial issues faced by individuals with medical comorbidity and the complexity (and often fragmentation) of the current health care system, team-based delivery of evidence-based treatment has emerged as a cost-effective approach to depression care.119 A recent study showed that the collaborative care model, a team-based approach to the management of chronic conditions centered around a care manager who is a core member of the medical team, is effective in managing symptoms of depression and pain among individuals with SCI.48 This approach is particularly compelling, given the preference of many individuals with SCI and depression to be treated within the rehabilitation or primary care setting as opposed to a mental health setting or via telephone.18\n\nThe Christopher Reeve Foundation has excellent information for members of the team, patients, and their families on understanding depression with SCI (https://www.christopherreeve.org/living-with-paralysis/health/depression). A key point is that team members can contribute to depression if they believe that individuals with SCI will have a low quality of life. Research shows that individuals with SCI have a much higher quality of life than health care providers anticipate.120\n\nSpecific strategies that all team members can use to inspire hope include setting small, easily achievable goals to promote self-efficacy and hope,121 engineering high success rates, providing access to activities that the individual finds to be meaningful or pleasant outside of therapies,122 promoting ongoing access to meaningful relationships, focusing on a future with meaning and purpose, and promoting a sense of “the possible,” as well as hope for the moment.123\n\nWhen team members note depressive symptoms in individuals with SCI that have not been diagnosed, they should encourage and initiate referrals for treatment and tell these individuals and their families that medication and therapy, even for short periods, have been shown to be very effective.124 Evidence-based strategies for promoting family integrity when there is a new disability include maintaining meaningful family traditions during rehabilitation, facilitating open communication among family members, promoting a tone of togetherness, and relieving guilt. Implementing these strategies as a cluster may also promote hope for the moment.\n\nAn SCI may be transformative for patients and their families. In health psychology research, positive change and transcendence from challenging life experiences and disability are referred to as posttraumatic growth, benefit finding, stress-related growth, and thriving, all of which have been found to be correlated with a high quality of life.125 Assisting individuals with SCI and their families to experience transformation may also be transformative for the team.124\n\n3.5 Treat major depression by using pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological approaches on the basis of clinical presentation (e.g., comorbid conditions), treatment efficacy, and patient preferences.\n\nRationale\n\nResearch in the mental health treatment literature shows that combined medical and psychotherapeutic treatment is more effective than either treatment alone.126,127 Therefore, for individuals with SCI, clinicians should offer combined medical and psychosocial treatment for major depression whenever possible. Otherwise, treatment recommendations can be based on other factors such as patient preferences because the efficacy of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy for depression are similar.128 A treatment preference study found that 78% to 80% of individuals with SCI and depression were very or somewhat likely to use antidepressants or individual counseling, whereas significantly fewer (48%) were willing to use group counseling.18 Individuals with SCI tend to prefer being treated for depression in rehabilitation or other medical settings rather than being referred to specialized mental health providers. Some guidelines recommend psychotherapy over medications for mild depression.129 Aggressively treating comorbid conditions that may exacerbate depression, such as using pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain and treating hypothyroidism or obstructive sleep apnea, may also improve depression.130\n\n3.5.1 Consider pharmacological treatments for major depression.\n\nRationale\n\nOne good-quality, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in individuals with SCI found that venlafaxine extended release (mean dose 186 mg per day), an SNRI, was effective in treating core symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, anhedonia, guilt, psychomotor agitation, psychomotor retardation, and psychic anxiety) diagnosed an average of 11 years following SCI.131 Venlafaxine extended release was also found to significantly decrease nociceptive pain and did not increase spasticity.\n\nBecause of the paucity of RCTs that use other antidepressants, evidence-based treatment algorithms cannot be developed. However, from knowledge gained from nonrandomized studies in SCI populations132 and practice guidelines and meta-analyses from other populations,133–135 some general recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy can be made, including the following:\n\nIn general, SSRIs and SNRIs are likely the best-tolerated antidepressant classes. However, fluoxetine, an SSRI with a long half-life, should be used with caution because of case study data showing increased risk of spasticity in individuals with SCI.74 From studies in non-SCI populations, the efficacies of SSRIs and SNRIs are similar.73 Thus, medication choice is based on anticipated side effects, interactions with other medications, and patient treatment history or preferences.\n\nAs with treatment of anxiety, a check on EKG for QTc prolongation due to frequent polypharmacy before selecting treatment including serotonergic agents should be considered, particularly with citalopram or concurrent use of other medications with proarrhythmic risk, such as prochlorperazine or methadone. Serotonin syndrome and the possibility of increased spasms and agitation are risks for polypharmacy as well, particularly when combined with indirectly or directly acting sympathomimetic agents.\n\nTricyclic antidepressants can cause drowsiness and should be used with caution because of the risk of anticholinergic side effects that may exacerbate common SCI-related symptoms (e.g., hypotension, constipation, urinary retention).\n\nOther antidepressant options such as bupropion, mirtazapine, vortioxetine, and vilazodone have not been systematically studied in SCI populations.\n\nAntidepressant dosages should be started at about half the typical starting dose, and dose titration should occur at about half the rate of that typically used in non-medically ill populations.\n\nTarget doses and duration at that dose (i.e., 6 to 8 weeks) required to "
