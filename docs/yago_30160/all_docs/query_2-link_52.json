        "text": "Welcome to the world premiere of Becoming a Man!\n\nBecoming a Man is adapted from the critically acclaimed memoir written by P. Carl, who joins me at the helm of this production as writer and co-director. I first got to know Carl when he founded HowlRound Theatre Commons and came to Boston as co-artistic director of ArtsEmerson. We then worked closely together on Claudia Rankine’s The White Card for which Carl served as dramaturg.\n\nWhen Carl shared an early draft of his memoir with me many years ago, my immediate question to him was, “What if we made this into a play?” His answer resulted in a commission of this new work for the A.R.T. and a developmental process that has spanned over the last few years.\n\nWe are thrilled to be finally producing this new play with such an incredible cast led by Petey Gibson. Our extraordinary creative team includes a number of artists returning to the A.R.T.: costume designer Qween Jean (Macbeth In Stride, What to Send Up When It Goes Down), lighting designer Cha See (What to Send Up When It Goes Down), music and sound designer Paul James Prendergast (All the Way) and video designer Brittany Bland (1776). We are excited to welcome scenic designer Emmie Finckel and associate director Lyam B. Gabel who are making their A.R.T. debut.\n\nEvery performance of Becoming a Man includes Act II, a facilitated conversation with the audience about the play and its themes featuring an incredible roster of local leaders, artists, or medical professionals, and activists exploring the production’s Essential Question, “When we change, can the people we love come with us?” We are so grateful to have received funding from The Boston Foundation in support of the community engagement we will be cultivating around this production.\n\nAct II is facilitated by Athena Vaughn (she/her), Chastity Bowick (she/her), Dan Rice (he/they), Dante Gonzalez (he/they), and Lyam B. Gabel (they/he). Please see the updating list of Act II guests.\n\nI am deeply moved by Carl’s courage and desire to share his story with the world. I am honored to be part of the journey in bringing this story to the stage.\n\nThank you for coming to the theater and joining us!"
