        "text": "The headline act who didn't need to walk on stage\n\nAnthony Zurcher\n\nReporting from the convention\n\nThere were dozens of speakers here at the Republican convention on Monday â politicians, conservative activists and ordinary citizens. But the star of the evening never approached the stage or stood before a microphone.\n\nWhen Donald Trump walked into the arena during the eveningâs proceedings, the building shook with cheers, applause and chants of support.\n\nIt was the moment the assembled convention crowd was waiting for â a chance to give the leader of their party a heroâs welcome just two days after his brush with an assassinâs bullet.\n\nThe evidence of that attack was immediately visible, as the former presidentâs right ear was heavily â but neatly â bandaged. For the next hour, he sat in the VIP section next to his newly chosen running mate, JD Vance, and surrounded by members of his immediate family.\n\nEvery time the jumbo video screens showed the former president, the crowd reignited with applause.\n\nIt will be three days until Trump formally accepts the nomination with an address to the delegates â and the nation. In the meantime, more Republicans will take the stage, including former rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. Vance will deliver his own nomination acceptance speech on Wednesday.\n\nAs this evening made clear, however, everyone else is just warm-up acts. Trump is the main event.\n\nWe're finishing our live coverage for the day. You can read a full recap of what happened here.\n\nA pick for economic populism\n\nNatalie Sherman\n\nNew York business reporter\n\nThe pick of JD Vance for running mate cements the Republican Partyâs turn toward economic populism under Donald Trump.\n\nThe 39-year-old first gained national recognition as the author of Hillbilly Elegy, his memoir of growing up poor in a region hollowed out by globalisation.\n\nDuring his 2022 senate campaign, the Yale Law School grad made his blue-collar background a key part of his appeal to voters and he has continued to focus on such issues since his election - and these views have led to some unlikely collaborations.\n\nLast year, for example, he co-sponsored a bill with arch-progressive senator Elizabeth Warren that would claw back pay for executives at failed banks. She told Politico last year, external that he had been âterrificâ to work with.\n\nHis elevation underscores the dramatic ways Trump has changed the Republican Party, when it comes to the economic policies, the nominal focus at the convention today.\n\nThe GOP platform still includes plenty of traditional priorities, like less regulation and lower taxes. But it also champions ideas that were once anathema for Republicans, like a 10% tariffs that Trump has proposed for all imports.\n\nBiden calls Vance a 'clone' of Trump\n\nTom Bateman\n\nTravelling with Biden\n\nAs Donald Trump was met with adulation in Milwaukee, President Biden has flown to Las Vegas - both men signalling the election campaign is back on after only the briefest of pauses.\n\nIâm in the travelling press pool with the president on Air Force 1.\n\nBefore boarding at Andrews Air Force Base, Biden headed over to us on the tarmac, breaking into a jog as he got close, and spent a minute answering questions shouted over the roar of the plane.\n\nAsked whether he had confidence in his Secret Service detail amid swirling questions about failures to protect Trump, he replied assertively: âYes I doâ.\n\nOn Trumpâs pick of JD Vance as his running mate, Biden described the Republican politician as âa clone of Trump on the issuesâ.\n\nWeâre now in Vegas, where a crowd of spectators behind barricades watched the motorcade pull into the city; before two days of official meetings and campaign events.\n\nAs with the NBC interview he recorded before flying and being aired tonight, team Biden is signalling a fully throated return to its campaign themes - including its portrayal of Donald Trump as threat to democracy.\n\nTrump 'one tough SOB', says union chief\n\nNearly all the major labour unions have endorsed Biden, but one influential group has withheld support for the Democrat.\n\nInstead, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Sean O'Brien, appeared on stage at the RNC on Monday night, making clear the labour union is \"not beholden to any party\".\n\nHe praised Trump, saying \"no other [Republican] nominee would have invited the Teamsters into their arena\".\n\nâYou can have whatever opinion you want, but one thing is clear... Trump is a candidate who is not afraid of hearing from new, loud and often critical voices.\n\n\"I think we all can agree whether people like him or they donât like him, in light of what happened to him on Saturday, he has proven to be one tough SOB.â\n\n'Fight! Fight! Fight!'\n\nKayla Epstein\n\nReporting from the convention\n\nAs Trump walked on to the floor and climbed the stairs to the VIP section, the first hand he shook as he got to the box was Tucker Carlsonâs - a sign of the right-wing media figureâs importance in Trumpâs orbit.\n\nThe bandage on Trumpâs ear was impossible to miss as he took his place next to his running mate, JD Vance.\n\nThe Republican supporters on the floor were ecstatic.\n\nThey began chanting âU-S-A, U-S-Aâ and then âfight! fight! fight!â as they pumped their fists in the air, a gesture that many here have adopted after Trumpâs own symbol of defiance as he was spirited off the stage after being shot in Pennsylvania."
