        "text": "Arenet L. Sanders transitioned to be with the Lord on Saturday, July 15, 2023, after a long illness at McLaren Greater Lansing in Lansing, Michigan at the age of 85 years old. Arenet was the fifth child born to Augustus and Josie (Smith) Sanders on Saturday, August 7, 1937, in Brookhaven, Mississippi. Arenet attended church with his parents while growing up in Brookhaven and accepted the Lord at an early age and maintained a personal relationship with the LORD until his passing.\n\nArenet attended Brookhaven public schools where he played on his high school basketball team with Earvin Johnson, Sr. After graduation he joined the “great migration” as many black families did to the northern states. He, along with other family members chose Lansing, Michigan, as he and his brothers had previously spent summers working there with their Father. This time to stay; looking for job opportunities, a better life and as he said, “promises of equal pay to whites”; and “It was true,” he later said. He began his career in public service driving buses for the City of Lansing. He relocated to Detroit, Michigan along the way where he drove buses for the Detroit Metro System but returned to Lansing a short time later.\n\nHe was employed as a chief auto mechanic at Shell Gas on Logan and Main Streets–he had a great love of cars and raced them too! He left there to become co-owner/operator of Sanders Brothers Gulf Gas Station with his brothers Earnest and John. Eventually, years later, he returned to driving buses for the Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) until he retired after 32 years of service.\n\nArenet never met a stranger; he greeted his passengers with a smile while oftentimes striking up conversations and even long-lasting friendships with some. His brother Gerald said he met a number of people who remembered him fondly from meeting him during his tenure with CATA. When Arenet was happy he had a great infectious laughter that you just couldn’t help but laugh along with him. He spent much of his retirement years raising his grandchildren; Marvin, Bridget, and Mario (Annette’s children), taking care of his lawn and flowers, tinkering on his car while offering automotive advice to help others—it was in his blood. He also waited in anticipation of the delivery of “Sunday dinner” from his sisters, Mary “Sister” or Mildred and then his niece, Sharon after they passed. After his health started deteriorating, he spent most of his time at home sitting in his recliner in front of the TV watching sports and his favorite TV shows with his 2 dogs; Spike and Zoe, whom he loved very much. He also spoke happily and longingly of those family members who had journeyed on before him to their resting place.\n\nArenet leaves to cherish his memory his two sons, Roderick Sanders and Travis Sanders both of Marietta, Georgia; daughter-in-law, Delores “Lou” Asis; grandchildren, Thomas Demps, Jr., Lansing, Michigan, Zahirah Sanders, Atlanta, Georgia, John Coward of Las Vegas, Nevada, Arenet Jason (Veronica) Sanders and Chrissy Sanders (partner, Alex Belmonte) both of Burbank, California, Marvin Sanders, Lansing, Michigan, and Bridget and Mario Sanders of Alton, Texas; three great-grandchildren, Ahmira Walker, Noah Belmonte and Arenet Jalen Sanders; brother, Gerald Sanders of Dana Point, California; many nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends including special friend and ex-wife, Shirley Lester of Kentucky.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his sons, Thomas Demps, Sr. and Arenet Sanders, Jr; daughters, Andrea Williams and Annette Sanders; parents, Augustus and Josie Sanders; brothers, Augustus Jr., Earnest, John and Lorenzo Sanders; sisters, Mary King and Mildred Skinner; and special aunt, Mary Lou Freeman."
