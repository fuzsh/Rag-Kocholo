He gave them gifts plucked from his closet: a worn pair of Tod’s dress shoes, in a size 9½, too large for Mr. Nartov, and Marc Jacobs sunglasses, the lenses scratched. “But they were kind gestures,” Ms. Kieu, 33, said.\n\nMr. Tyler-Leonard, 58, was in poor health and rarely left his apartment. “I have no relatives, no children. I had nobody to help me and they stepped in,” he said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
