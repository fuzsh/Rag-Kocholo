        "text": "Lester Malcolm Smith, Sr., one month shy of his 84th birthday, and in the presence of his beloved wife and children, died Friday night at 10:55 pm from complications due to exposure to Agent Orange while serving his country in Vietnam.\n\nGraveside Services will be held 11:00 AM Friday, October 6, 2023 at Ft. Mitchell National Cemetery with Pastor Alan Smith officiating. The family will receive friends 5:00 to 7:00 PM Thursday, October 5, 2023 at McMullen Funeral Home and Crematory, 3874 Gentian Blvd. Columbus, GA 31907.\n\nLes was born in Whitman, MA, on November 28, 1939, to Ralph Lester Smith and Florence Mildred Johnson Smith. He and his older sister, Millie, shared a warm, loving, fun bond. They both inherited their wit and dry humor from their mother and their strong work ethic and respect for all people from their dad. Smith Bros Dairy was founded by Les’ Great Uncle Joe around 1900. His father and three uncles inherited the farm that remained a working, family-run dairy into the mid 1990’s. It was Les’ favorite place in all the world; a giant playground where he helped with every job he proved himself capable of doing, plus re-building broken or worn out tractors and trucks from the age of 10.\n\nLes was a graduate of Whitman High School (Class of ‘57) and Northeastern University in Boston (Class of ’63), earning a B.S. Degree in Business Administration. He was in ROTC throughout college. Upon graduation, he was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. ARMY, and stationed at Fort Gordon for signal Corps training. One night in 1963, he agreed to go on a blind date with a young nursing student at the Medical College of GA, Rose Scarborough. Though they would have only one more date before Les left for Vietnam, they already began discussing the special family they would one day build. Writing to each other daily was a great way to learn about each other. The bond they forged would only grow stronger; never to be broken. They were married in Columbus on June 25, 1966, at Rose’s childhood church, Sherwood Methodist. They were blessed with Lester, Jr. “Spike” in 1968, and Jennifer Erin in 1969. In 1973, Thy-Anna Elizabeth (1969) and Joseph Andrew, (1972) both from Vietnam joined the family and in 1975, Ha-Ly Ngai 1973 from Vietnam, and Thomas “TAD” (1975) from Cambodia by way of Vietnam also joined. Finally, in 1980, Brian Tyler (1975) and in 1981, Tina Rose (1977) completed the family.\n\nLiving in Augusta while Rose finished school at MCG, Les became a manager-trainee with JC Penney and served in the US ARMY Reserves. In early 1968, his unit was among the first reserves called to active duty by President Johnson. They were transferred to Fort Lee, VA. Les received a short leave to make it to Rose’s graduation on June 8, 1968, and was rewarded by being present at his first child’s birth the very next day! Then as a 1st Lt., after advanced training at Ft. Monmouth, NJ, he was sent for a second tour of duty in Vietnam as a Signal Corps officer in early March 1969. Rose and Spike moved to Columbus to live with her mother and Rose worked at (then) The Medical Center. She and Les resumed their correspondence, hearing each other’s voices only once in midsummer by radio phone. He was promoted to Captain and was delighted to learn that another baby was expected. When the President began deactivating reservists, Cpt. Smith made it to GA just in time to be present in the delivery room to welcome Jennifer in November 1969. It would be at least 25 years before he ever talked about his experiences in Vietnam.\n\nAfter settling back in Columbus, he worked in administration at Columbus Carpet Mill, then at Auburn University in the Building and Grounds Dept. Les finished his working career at Columbus College as Director of Plant Operations.\n\nThroughout all those years, Les and Rose followed through with their hopes to build their family by adopting children who desperately needed loving homes. They began searching for and reaching out for the children they just knew were waiting for them. And in due course, the 8-pack was complete. Foster son Tommy Minton, will always be considered a true part of the family, as well.\n\nLes is survived by his wife Rose, son, Lester, Jr. “Spike” (Kim) Smith, grandson, Chas (Lindsay) Darnell, great-grandchildren, Alyssa, Madison and Grady of Decatur AL, his daughter, Jennifer (Michael) Kirby of Lancaster SC, granddaughters, Erin K. Neale (Ben) of Clover SC, Shannon of Rock Hill SC and Lauren of Lancaster SC, daughter, Thy-Anna Elizabeth Smith, grandson, Kanden (Britney) Blackmon, great-grandsons, Micah and Kaven, son, Joseph Andrew Smith, daughter, Ha-Ly Ngai S. Kidd (Simon) of Birmingham AL, son, and fellow veteran Thomas Anthony Dooley “TAD” Smith, granddaughter Kendall Smith, her sister, Taylor (Terry) Holland and children, Kohen and Kenleigh, son, Brian Tyler Smith (Jennifer), grandchildren John, Jordan and Jacob of Weatherford TX, daughter Tina Rose S. Osbourne (John), granddaughters, Nicole Helen and Ella Leslie of Ft. Mitchell AL, Morgan O. Hall (Jackson), great-grandson, Grayson of Dora AL, granddaughter, Abigail Rose (Garrett) Frey, great-granddaughter, Teagan Rose of Cincinnati OH, his sister, Mildred S. Dickie (the late Richard) of Pembroke MA and their children, Lynne, Beverly, Brian, all of MA, and Gail of Chicago, IL. Les is also survived by his dearest friends of fifty years, Danny and Donna Lipp, and dear friend, Kim Kopp. He will be keenly missed by all. The family has hearts full of gratitude for Dr. Vibhuti Ansar, Dr Ferdinand Alcaide, Dr. Charles McCall, Dr. Nukula, Dr Abdul Khan, everyone at Piedmont Family Practice past and present, and Family Health Pharmacy (especially Heather) and the special nurses and CNAs on Piedmont Midtown 7 Main. And to Keyonna Ellis and dear Gloria Scott who were Les’ special Visiting Angels, you will always be in our hearts.\n\nLes would have loved to know that donations were made in his memory to Valley Rescue Mission or Feeding the Valley. He always wanted children to get enough to eat. Mercy Ships and St. Jude are also charities close to his heart."
