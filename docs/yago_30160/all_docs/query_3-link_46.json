        "text": "ARCHIBALD QUINCY JONES, FAIA (1913-1979)\n\nJones was born in Kansas City MO and raised in Gardena CA, finishing high school in Seattle WA. He went to the University of Washington in architecture, where he was particularly influenced by Lionel Pries. He graduated with a BA in Architecture in 1936. After marrying a fellow architecture student, Ruth Schneider, Jones returned to Los Angeles, working first in the offices of the modernist architects Douglas Honnold and George Vernon Russell from 1936 to 1937, Burton A. Schutt from 1937 to 1939, 1939 to 1940 for Paul Williams, then at Allied Engineers of San Pedro from 1940 to 1942, where he met architect and future partner Frederick Earl Emmons, third photo above.\n\nIn 1942, Jones divorced and became a lieutenant commander in the Navy assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Lexington. Discharged in 1945, Jones returned to Los Angeles and opened an architectural office in a house in Laurel Canyon built with his former wife. On his first day in business Jones secured his first client. Jones later partnered with Paul Williams on several projects in the Palm Springs area including the Palm Springs Tennis Club (1947), the Town & Country Restaurant (1948), and Romanoff's On the Rocks (1950).\n\nThe December 1950 issue of Architectural Forum featured a \"Builder's House of the Year\" designed by Jones. The same issue also awarded the innovative Palo Alto building magnate Joseph Eichler \"Subdivision of the Year.\" Eichler then invited Jones to tour the Palo Alto development he had just completed where he suggested they join forces. This relationship continued until Eichler's death in 1974. Through Eichler, Jones was provided both the venue and the freedom to implement park-like common areas, or greenbelts, in tract housing developments. In 1960, Jones was hired by William Pereira as a planning partner in the development of the city of Irvine CA which has since become a model for greenways in urban planning.\n\nThe Eichler commission prompted Jones to reconnect with Frederick Emmons. Their partnership lasted from 1951 until Emmons' retirement in 1969. Their designs are reflected in some 5,000 Eichler- developed houses. Jones and Emmons were awarded national AIA Firm of the Year in 1969. Jones was professor and later Dean of Architecture at the University of Southern California 1951-1967. By the 1960s Jones was designing university and corporate buildings including the 1963 IBM Aerospace Headquarters in Westchester CA and University of California campus buildings.
