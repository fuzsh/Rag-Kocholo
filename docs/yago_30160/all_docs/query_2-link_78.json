        "text": "Earlier this month I had the amazing opportunity to lead a question-and-answer panel with actor Jeremy London at Evansville Raptor Con. Let me tell you, it was a bit of a challenge to break his shell and have some fun. I was nervous, because I'm a fan, and his fans were there to hear some great stories.\n\nOne Question Got Spicy\n\nI asked Jeremy London if he was happier living far away from the Hollywood lifestyle. He told me that without a doubt, he and his fiance are very happy living in Mississippi. The COVID pandemic actually revealed a talent that he didn't even know that he had - Gardening and canning pepper jelly.\n\n'When COVID hit our backyard was just nothing but dog poop and nothingness. And I was not ok with it. Instead of being in the house all day, we decided to turn our yard into a garden. We literally grew so much stuff that I didn't know what to do with it. We had so many hot peppers. I don't even know what we were growing them - I don't even eat hot peppers! So, I found this recipe for pepper jelly, I had never even heard of it. I made some and tasted it, and it was one of the best things I've ever tried. So, now I have my own recipe. I cook it and jar it, and I sign every jar.' ~ Jeremy London\n\nLondons Most Wanted Home Goods\n\nYes, you can actually buy the pepper jelly that Jeremy Talked about at Evansville Raptor Con through his Etsy shop LondonsMostWanted.\n\nOur peppers are hand-picked and made in small batches to ensure a fresh taste and flavor. Our pepper jelly is made with various types of peppers. The Cowboy flavor is sweet with little to no heat and the Outlaw flavor has some heat. Not only will you be getting an extraordinary jelly, you will be getting a jar that has been personally signed by Jeremy London himself."
