        "text": "Newspaper Editor & Clergyman\n\nLocation: Pres*H*132\n\nBorn at Montrose, Scotland on 10 October 1821, the son of George Alexander Syme a schoolteacher and Jean née Mitchell; his younger brothers were Ebenezer (Melbourne General Cemetery) and David (Boroondara Cemetery), the latter whose proprietorship of The Age helped shape the political and social landscape of Victoria for over five decades.\n\nAt the age of fourteen he entered the University of Aberdeen gaining an MA before studying theology and ultimately rejecting the dogma of both the Established Church of Scotland and the Free Presbyterian Church; under the influence of Rev James Morrison at Kilmarnock, Syme then went on to become a Baptist minister at Nottingham, England (1848-63) where he was said to have been active in radical progressive social causes notably Temperance, the early closing movement, shorter hours of labour, and the extension of suffrage.\n\nDescribed as “kindly, calm and considerate when unexcited, but incoherent under stress”, bad health forced Syme to migrate to Victoria in 1863. He rejected religion becoming a secularist, joined The Age and edited the paper for eight months in 1866 during his brother’s trip to England; for many years he was editor of The Age’s country journal, The Leader (1863-85) until ill-health forced his retirement; The Age described his influence as “a staunch Liberal and through little known to the Melbourne public, he did valuable service to the cause of Liberalism in the colony with his pen for many years”.\n\nSyme died suddenly at the residence of his son, George Adlington Syme (q.v.), Collins Street, Melbourne on the last day of 1894 aged 73; Rev Charles Strong (q.v.) conducted a “simple but impressive burial service” attended by brother David, his trusted editor Arthur Windsor (Coburg Cemetery), Sir Samuel Gillott (Melbourne General Cemetery) and Baron Ferdinand von Mueller (St. Kilda Cemetery).\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 6 1851-90 (R-Z).\n\nSayers, C., “David Syme.

Her education at Newnham College, Cambridge (MA, 1914) and University of Melbourne (Dip.Ed, 1914) suggests an earlier career as a teacher (1915-21), but little is known. Instead, Syme forged a name in the art scene as one of the pioneering women artists in the 1920s and ’30s; she studied at the La Grande Chavmiére, Paris (1922-23), Grosvenor School of Modern Art, London (1929) where her lifelong friend Ethel Spowers (1890-1947) was also a pupil and later at Académie Lhote (1929-30), Paris before her return to Australia.\n\nOne of her first exhibitions of watercolours held at Queen’s Hall (Sep-Oct 1925) heralded her coming as an artist; reviewers both praised and criticised her works equally notably The Age critic who reported – “All very good, but in many cases, not carried far enough”. After her return to Australia in 1930 her art began to reflect the modernist style with influence of Cubism. A councillor of the Women’s College (Melbourne University) from its inception until her death, Syme was also prominent in the formation of the Contemporary Art Society (1938) and exhibited in the inaugural exhibition held the following year.\n\nResiding at 202 Orrong Road, Toorak, she died on 6 June 1961 after a long illness. A major exhibition of her works was held at Jim Alexander Gallery, Melbourne in 1988.\n\nSource:\n\n“A Biographical Register 1788-1939” (Vol II).\n\nRobb, G & Smith, E., “Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists” (1993).\n\nMcCulloch, A., “The Encyclopedia of Australian Art” (1994).\n\nThe Age 22 September 1925.\n\nThe Argus 22 September 1925.\n\nThe Herald 7 June 1961.\n\nThe Age 8 & 10 June 1961.\n\nThe Sun 9 June 1961.\n\nBuilder & Contractor\n\nLocation: Pres*S*18\n\nWith his younger brother (Sir) John (St. Kilda Cemetery), Donald became the driving force in the business founded by their father William (d 1892) – “Swanson Bros”. Born at Bendigo, Victoria on 20 December 1859 and educated at St. Paul’s Grammar School, Donald took over the company on his father’s retirement in 1889; until 1983 the firm was to remain a family business.\n\nThe depression of the 1890s led Donald to seek work interstate until favourable conditions allowed his return; the firm then went on to become one of the leading builders of its era responsible for the construction of many notable Melbourne buildings, including the City Baths, Swanston Street (1903) (“Italianate in style with red and cream brickwork”); the former Magistrates Court, corner Russell and LaTrobe Streets (1911) (“a massive stone structure in Norman style”); Scotch College, Hawthorn; various buildings at the University of Melbourne; the Scots Church Assembly Hall, Collins Street (1915) on Collins Street; and in controversial circumstances over “Monash (q.v.) & Anderson”, the concrete dome of the State Library of Victoria, Swanston Street (1911) – at the time the largest of its kind in the world. Donald was considered the manager and driving force of the operations while Sir John as Lord Mayor of Melbourne (1920-23) took on the public role; after Sir John’s death in 1924 Donald continued even though totally blind after 1931. Both brothers would serve as presidents of the Master Builders’ Association and the Federation of Master Builders of Australia.\n\nSwanson resided at 50 Balaclava Road, St. Kilda where he died on 11 September 1940 with an estate sworn for probate at £18,891.\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 12 1891-1939 (Smy-Z).\n\nThe Argus 13 September 1940.\n\nSerle, G., “John Monash.

Unlike his siblings, Henry had little to do with the family business during his formative years instead forged a remarkable career as an inventor of extraordinary ability well ahead of his time. Shy and modest and with no formal education, he became interested in science and engineering and by the age of ten his observations of insect flight led to the invention of a wind-up flying machine he called an “ornithopter” and is credited with being the first person in Australia to have experimented with flight.\n\nBy the age of fourteen he had invented an electric continuous current dynamo which was later used by Zénobe Gramme of Belgium to become the standard after 1871 leading to the rapid development of the electric motor industry throughout the world. Less then a year after the American Alexander Bell had invented the telephone, Sutton had already designed and constructed a further twenty different models as well as a complete telephone network system at the family’s music warehouse (1877) leading Bell to visit Australia to see how it had been achieved.\n\nSutton was also involved in experiments with light, including a mercury vacuum pump (used to develop light bulbs) and the incandescent globe independent of Thomas Edison’s discoveries. Other inventions include the world’s first portable radio able to transmit five hundred yards; a portable electric storage battery; but probably his greatest invention was his design of a telegraphic form of television he called the ‘telephane’. Sutton took out very few patents for his remarkable designs, preferring to “benefit fellow workers in science” thus partly explaining his lack of international recognition.\n\nA keen and enthusiastic motorist, in December 1903 it was Sutton who moved the motion that led to the formation of the (Royal) Automobile Club of Victoria. After 1894, he concentrated on the family business with his brothers Alfred, Walter and Frederick (q.v.). Residing at 9 Erskine Street, Malvern he died from chronic nephritis on 28 July 1912.\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 6 1851-90 (R-Z).\n\n“The History of Suttons.

While attending University of Glasgow (Hon LL.D., 1887) between 1859 and 1864 he came under the influence of Edward Caird, professor of moral philosophy and rejected the scholastic Calvinist teaching as the true and sufficient expression of the evangelical faith, instead following a more liberal theological view. Ordained in 1868, his success as a “pastor, preacher, liberal theological teacher and social reformer” led to his appointment as head of Scots Church, Collins Street (1875-83) in Melbourne. Yet, “almost from the hour of his arrival”, controversy was never far away and his essays, outspoken criticism of social evils and advocacy of evangelical reform soon led to friction within the presbytery; Strong offered his resignation in August 1881 but instead agreed to take leave and he left to visit Scotland in 1882.\n\nBut his absence did little to resolve the theological divide and soon after his return he became embroiled in fresh controversy over his failure to denounce George Higinbotham’s (q.v.) lecture he chaired titled “The Relation between Science and Religion” and was threatened with a libel for heresy; in a tense and dramatic sequence of events he refused to attend the General Assembly on 14 November 1883 arguing the action against him as “unconstitutional and illegal” according to the laws of the Church and defiantly set sail for Scotland the next day. In November 1884, Strong returned to Melbourne and the following year founded the Australian Church – a free religious fellowship – yet it was his controversial views that led to its eventual demise in 1957. Among the many admirers of Strong were the politician Sir James Lorimer (St. Kilda Cemetery), Alfred Felton (St. Kilda Cemetery) of “Felton, Grimwade & Co”, and Alfred Deakin (St. Kilda Cemetery), thrice Prime Minister of Australia.\n\nResiding at 7 Barnalo Grove, Armadale he died while holidaying at Lorne on 12 February 1942.\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 6 1851-90 (R-Z).\n\nThe Age 14 February 1942.\n\nThe Herald 12 February 1942.\n\nMacdonald, A., “One Hundred Years of Presbyterianism in Victoria” (1937).\n\nHamilton, R., “Jubilee History of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria” (1888).\n\n(Image courtesy La Trobe Picture Collection, State Library of Victoria, A/S29/01/81/36)\n\nCouncillor, Old Colonist, Cemetery Trustee & Methodist Identity\n\nLocation: Meth*L*79\n\nOne of the founding fathers of the Wesleyan Church in Victoria and a pioneer of Brighton, Charles Stone was born in London on 4 August 1819, the son of Robert Stone (d 1875) and Elizabeth née Burrell. As a teenager, the family migrated to Van Dieman’s Land (Tasmania) landing at Hobart Town in April 1834 after a tedious voyage of nearly eight months where they spent the next three years. It was here that Stone, in his own words “found peace through believing in Jesus my Saviour” and made his “first attempt to preach at Roseneath, a few miles from Hobart, in June 1838”. Soon after he left for the young Port Phillip settlement in November 1838 where he “exercised his gifts by feeding the little flock” and spent a period at Little (East) Brighton on Henry Dendy’s (Walhalla Cemetery) Special Survey. In October 1841, Stone moved to Williamstown opening a day school, “athirst for knowledge” dedicated and committed and “often rose a three o’clock to ready and study”. Returning to Brighton four years later he taught for the next six years and later established business as a gardener and florist in Union Street (Hawthorn Road); his advice during the introduction of Public Education was keenly sought. “Uniform in temper and kindness”, Stone was an original Trustee of the Brighton General Cemetery (1854-98) and a local Councillor (1861-64). Writing in “A Century of Victorian Methodism”, the Rev Sir C Irving Benson (q.v.) said of Stone;\n\n“he was a greatly respected figure in the community, a trusted confidant of many, advising them in matters of law, making out their wills, prescribing medicine for their ailments, and the blessing of the peacemaker was his. There was a beautiful balance in his Christian character, gracious and tender, yet strong in principle and mighty with God” while the local Brighton Leader commented “his sterling character, fidelity to principle, and his unvarying integrity made him a power for good…no one could justly charge him with uttering a discourteous word, or performing an unkind action”.\n\nHe died on 13 August 1898 survived by his wife and large family of four sons and six daughters; his marriage to Emma née Hurlstone (d 1901) in 1839 was one of the first performed in the colony while his death removed one of the last direct links with John Batman. Many old residents attended his funeral to pay their last respects which was said to have been one of the largest processions in the district.\n\nSource:\n\nBrighton Leader 20 & 27 August 1898.\n\nBrighton Southern Cross 20 August 1898.\n\nThe Argus 16 August 1898.\n\nBenson, C. (ed), “A Century of Victorian Methodism” (1935).\n\nIndustrialist, Company Director & Engineer\n\nLocation: CofE*ZA*1017\n\nOne of Australia’s great industrialists, Stewart was born at Wick, Scotland on 28 May 1876 the eldest of nine children to Robert Stewart, a ship carpenter and Sarah née Geddes. After his father’s death placed him in a position of assuming responsibility for the family, he gained his chief engineer’s certificate and while working with the “Aberdeen White Star Line” had the fortune to fall in love with Grace Cuming (later to marry on 4 January 1905 at Yarraville), whose father James (Footscray Cemetery) founded “Cuming Smith & Co” in 1875 that would later merge with the “Felton, Grimwade & Co” empire in 1897.\n\nBut rather than take advantage of marrying into a wealthy family, Stewart would make a name of his own. In an enduring partnership with fellow Scot William Fyvie (“Stewart & Fyvie”) that lasted over twenty five years they acquired the German patents and pioneered the industrial gas industry in Australia. In 1903 they were the first to demonstrate the use of an oxy-acetylene (welding) blowpipe; (Sir) Russell Grimwade (1879-1955) who was also keenly interested in the concept and for a time worked together with Fyvie and Stewart to develop the large-scale production of liquid air gas, but ultimately both went their own way and in 1911 Stewart formed “Commonwealth Oxygen Company” in partnership with “British Oxygen Company” (BOC) opening a plant at Alexandria in New South Wales. It wasn’t until 1935 that their companies merged to form “Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd” (CIG) (now “BOC Limited”) with Stewart serving as first chairman.\n\nKnighted in 1937, for over three decades, Stewart served on the board of some of Australia’s major industrial organisations and along with WL Baillieu (1859-1936), Sir Colin Fraser (1875-1944), Sir Herbert Gepp (Kangaroo Ground Cemetery), Sir Walter Massy-Greene (1874-1952), William Watt (1871-1946) and others, was a member of the powerful Collins House group of business leaders that was formed to expand and safeguard common interests during a time of great uncertainty in the 1920s and 30s; very few outside the business world acknowledged Stewart’s power and influence. Among the notable companies he held directorships included “Broken Hill South Ltd”, “Electrolytic Zinc of Australasia Ltd”, “The Trustees Executors & Agency Co”, “Mercantile Insurance Co Ltd” and “Dunlop Rubber of Australia Ld”; at the time of his death he was chairman of six major Australian companies and a director of fifteen others.\n\nDescribed as a “very private person with few interests other than business and family”, he resided at Cliveden Mansions – Wellington Parade, East Melbourne and died on 6 May 1956 aged 77. His estate was sworn for probate at £282,475.\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 12 1891-1939 (Smy-Z).\n\nThe Argus 7 May 1956.\n\nThe Age 7 May 1956.\n\nThe Herald 7 & 8 May 1956.\n\nThe Sun 7 May 1956.\n\nThe Advertiser (Footscray) 7 January 1905.\n\nPoynter, J., “Russell Grimwade” (1967).\n\n(Image courtesy BOC Limited)\n\nLord Mayor, Town Planner & Architect\n\nLocation: CofE*ZD*915\n\nBorn on 24 October 1858 at Hove, Sussex, England the son of Isaac Stapley a policemen and Mary née Hilton. The family had a titled baronetcy of dubious authenticity created around 1660 but had been left dormant since 1701; subsequent generations refused the title until his eldest brother Harry (d 1926) decided to claim it in 1912. After Frank’s private education and training as an architect, he went to South Africa in 1880 to practice and while there volunteered for active service in the Basuto war but was not called up; he returned to England three years later and shortly after his marriage to Eliza née Dunning migrated to Victoria.\n\nIn Melbourne he joined the leading architect William Salway (d 1903) around the same time as another up and coming architect – Harold Annear (1865-1933); Stapley later worked in the surveyor’s department of the Melbourne City Council (1887-93) before practising on his own account until a few months before his death. While his work was largely confined to industrial buildings, his most prominent design was the West Melbourne stadium noted for its lack of internal pillars to support the roof. But unlike many architects, Stapley saw the need for a visionary and co-ordinated approach towards town planning to cater for the expanding Melbourne metropolis and as president of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects (1920-21) was able to lobby for the creation of the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission in 1922 of which he was inaugural chairman. While the final report handed down in 1929 was well received, its timing amid the onset of the depression, an unfavourable political climate and recalcitrant municipalities saw few of the recommendations implemented much to Stapley’s profound regret; the plan was largely pro-road transport that focussed on the widening of feeder roads and the construction of bridges.\n\nOn 8 November 1901, Stapley was elected to the Melbourne City Council (1901-39) replacing Cr. Arthur Tuckett and was Lord Mayor in 1917-18 defeating Sir David Hennessy (Melbourne General Cemetery) in a tight and spirited contest (“feeling ran high among the supporters of the two contestants”); the following year Stapley lost a bitter tussle with William Cabena (Melbourne General Cemetery) for re-election as mayor.\n\nDescribed as “tall and handsome”, he died on 11 September 1944 survived by his second wife Edith née Simms whom he married on 3 September 1924 and was lauded for his influence over three decades as Melbourne’s chief advocate of town planning.\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 12 1891-1939 (Smy-Z).\n\nThe Argus 10 October 1917 & 13 September 1944.\n\nThe Age 12 September 1944.\n\nThe Herald 21 October 1926 & 2 February 1935.\n\n(Image courtesy Art and Heritage Collection, City of Melbourne)\n\nPolitician, Protestant Identity & Solicitor\n\nLocation: Pres*P*44\n\nSnowball was born on 18 July 1859 at Wolsingham, Durham, England the son of Joseph Snowball, a miller and Sarah née Fitzgerald. The family migrated to Victoria in 1868 and young Oswald was educated at Carlton College, Fitzroy before qualifying as a barrister and solicitor in 1883; in 1895 he formed a lasting legal partnership with his brother-in-law James Kaufmann as “Snowball & Kaufmann” of 49 Queen Street, Melbourne.\n\nJoining the Loyal Orange Institution of Victoria in 1878, Snowball became a Freemason in 1884 and steadily rose through the ranks to become master (1888-89), district master (1898-1905) and after the death of Sir Simon Fraser (q.v.) that of grand master (1905-28); he fought publicly against gambling and liquor and advocated the introduction of bible reading in State schools. But Snowball could be equally made to speak out against perceived Catholic anti-imperialism and his public stoushes with the Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix (1864-1963) were widely reported in the press notably in July 1912 when Snowball denounced the establishment of the “Catholic Federation” not for preventing unemployment or poverty but to “destroy state education” and condemned statements made that Catholic children sent to state schools should be denied sacraments of the church. Nor did the Catholic benefactor, John Wren (Boroondara Cemetery) escape criticism from Snowball.\n\nIn state politics, he succeeded Sir Thomas Bent (q.v.) in the seat of Brighton (1909-28); described as “assiduous in his constituents’ interests” he was re-elected comfortably in seven subsequent elections. His legal mind and unbiased objective views made him an ideal member of many sittings committees and royal commissions, including fruit, vegetable and jam (1915), fisheries (1918-19) and as chairman on Victorian outer ports (1923-28). From July 1927 until his untimely death, Snowball was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in the Hogan government and was acknowledged as “outstanding”. It was in July 1924 as a Nationalist rebel that he supported the no-confidence motion against the (Sir Alexander) Peacock (Creswick Cemetery) government which resulted in the election of his friend George Prendergast (1854-1937) as Premier and the short-lived Labor government (Jul-Nov 1924).\n\nResiding at Wolsingham – 11 Boxshall Street, Brighton he died from obstructive jaundice on 16 March 1928 survived by his wife Ellen née Anketell (d 1948) and was accorded a state funeral.\n\nSource:\n\nADB Volume 12 1891-1939 (Smy-Z).\n\nThe Argus 17 & 20 March 1928.\n\nThe Herald 16 March 1928.\n\nThe Age 13 July 1912 & 17 March 1928.\n\nGriffin, J., “John Wren.
