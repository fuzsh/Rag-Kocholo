        "text": "By Carolyn Landon\n\nSEVERAL weeks ago, Larry and I were on our way to Melbourne and found ourselves, even before we got out of Wonthaggi, behind a long line of slow-moving cars. Road works! We decided to turn off the highway and take the Loch Road, which eventually, if you know the way, turns off towards the Gurdies and soon enough puts us back on the road past Grantville, leaving us relaxed and clear-headed as we drive on to the city.\n\nAs the passenger in the car, I was able to survey the gorgeous meandering road, the valleys and steep slopes of the green hills and of clumps of tea tree and tall gums, all the time keeping an eye out for the occasional wombat or wallaby. We turned left off the Loch Road onto the Grantville-Glen Alvie road and then right towards the store at Kernot which marked the left turn onto Stewart Road that took us across the Bass Valley towards the Gurdies.\n\nA future prime minister, a dean of medicine with a dark secret and a brutal superintendent all play a role in \"The Killings at Newhaven\" but, for all the intrigue, author Joe Fairhurst never forgot that at its heart are two frightened young boys who died horrible deaths.\n\nBy Carolyn Landon\n\nBEFORE the “talkies” made their impact on social traditions at the several cinemas in Wonthaggi, young people got together at dances. Peruse the Powlett Express or the Sentinel – and even the Criterion – from 1909 until the mid-1930s and the columns are littered with advertising for dances at halls scattered round the district. Among the halls, there seemed to be a roster so there was at least one dance being held somewhere every week and, more importantly, so that the different bands – or orchestras, if you were lucky – were available to play.\n\nBy Pamela Rothfield\n\nTHE root vegetable chicory is synonymous with Phillip Island, with the first crops being grown on the island as far back as 1869. It is said that the famous botanist Dr Ferdinand von Mueller, who established Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Garden, advised a number of the early settlers on Phillip Island to avoid planting crops such as wheat and barley and instead grow crops of either chicory or mustard – which would be either too bitter or too hot for the destructive pests such as caterpillars.\n\nMany took his advice and chicory, which was used as a substitute for coffee or as an addition to coffee essence, became the staple crop of the island for about 100 years.​\n\nArthur Constable's tenor horn ... it’s not just the objects in the Wonthaggi Museum that intrigue\n\nbut the stories that come with them\n\n​By Mark Robertson\n\n​\n\nTHE Wonthaggi & District Historical Society is fortunate to be gifted a wide variety of objects to add to its extensive and diverse collection held in the Railway Station Museum. All the donations are interesting, especially if there is a story or provenance available to go with them.\n\nThings that come to us have usually been once beloved or valued or are reminders of painful but important memories that have perhaps been forgotten Often, when they find their way to the museum, they are in less than pristine condition. They have possibly been left in cupboards and drawers or away in attics or corners of sheds waiting to be re-discovered after decades of neglect have masked their value.\n\nBy Pam Rothfield\n\nIT was 22 February 1906, a wild Thursday afternoon and the 3,000-ton steel sailing ship, The Speke, was bound for Geelong to load a cargo of wheat after having completed her voyage from Peru to Sydney Heads.\n\n​The Speke was the second largest triple masted full-rigged vessel afloat, only being beaten by her sister ship The Ditton by an inch or two.\n\nShe had passed the Wilson Promontory and now faced the full force of the gale, battling the mountainous seas of Bass Strait and in the words of the first mate Mr Cooke, they were “as high as the topgallant mast”. ​\n\nBy Bruce Phillips\n\nI ONLY lived in Wonthaggi for a total of 18 years but they were years that had a profound effect on me. My parents – Jack and Agnes Phillips – had a grocery at 72 McBride Avenue where South Gippsland Photographic now is. My first recollection of the “Tech” was standing outside our shop and looking up at an imposing brick monolith. Miss (Win) Baker’s music room was located in that building – right on the corner of Watt Street and McBride. In the warmer weather the songs would drift out of that room and down McBride Avenue.\n\nDennis Leversha’s experience as a stage scenery painter stood him in good stead when he began painting the extraordinary murals that tell Wonthaggi’s history.\n\nBy Carolyn Landon\n\nIN 2006 after renovation of the Wonthaggi Railway Station was painstakingly completed over several years, the Wonthaggi Historical Society was finally able to return to permanently inhabit where it had been located since the 1980s. It was then that Irene Williams enlisted Dennis Leversha along with his wife, Bev, to help her (and many other dedicated WHS members) organise the displays for the new museum.\n\nWhen I first joined the Historical Society in that same year – 2006 – and began writing the PLOD Essays once a month, I witnessed the energy put in by the Levershas in arranging displays and also in figuring out ways to take the displays on tours.\n\nStarting life as a two-bedroom wattle and daub cottage, the stately hotel was built around the original structure, developing into what was described at the time as one of the most comfortable hotels in Victoria. From its confines, the sounds of revelry often punctured the evening quiet.\n\nDescribed in the press in 1889, as a “picturesque Swiss-looking house with its peaked gables and galleries and verandas”, the original Isle of Wight hotel was the toast of Phillip Island.\n\nSAM (Sebastian) Gatto is well known for his works about the rich history of Wonthaggi, including books about the hospital and local contribution in the two world wars.\n\nHis latest book is a lot more personal. A Sort of History of Me, My Family… And a Cow Named Gina tells the story of the Gatto family’s migration in 1951 from the village of Caridà, in the south of Italy, to the coal town of Wonthaggi. ​Much of the story is seen through the eyes of eight-year-old Sam, who, as the eldest child, is invested with great responsibilities to help his parents and siblings along the journey.\n\nA Sort of History was shortlisted for the 2022 Victorian Community History Awards.\n\nThis story was first published in The Current community newspaper in September 2004. Cherry McFree died in 2018, aged 93.\n\nA lifelong Phillip Islander, Cherry McFee didn’t like to go too far from the sea. Photo: Gill Heal\n\nBy Gill Heal\n\nCHERRY McFee remembers being a little scared of her grandfather, hot tempered William Thomas McFee, ironmonger and importer. But then, he had a reason to be cross. He'd lost most of his fortune in the 1890s Depression.\n\nWilliam Thomas - there's been a William going back through eight generations - had bought land in Rhyll and built a holiday house there. When the crash occurred he sold up the family home in Auburn and took up farming in Rhyll.\n\nAnd this is where young Cherry McFee grew up, going to school in the Mechanics Hall which her grandfather helped to establish.\n\nBy Carolyn Landon\n\nLAST summer the Wonthaggi Historical Society held a series of “15-Minute Talks,” which usually lasted for half an hour and only ended when the mine whistle blew everyone out of their seats and rendered the speaker silent. The talks were well attended and always interesting.\n\n​One of the most thorough and meticulously prepared talks, that could have kept the audience spell-bound for another hour were it not for the mine whistle, was given by Peter Hanley. It was based on the recollections Peter (the second born of seven children) and his mother had of Hanley’s Dairy, which operated on McKenzie Street from 1960 until 1983 and was owned and managed by Peter’s parents, Chick and Sadie Hanley. (While Peter and his mother were comparing memories of the family business and the people they worked with, they sometimes had to correct one another and had to admit that others might have different recollections. Nevertheless, the detail is wonderful.)\n\nTheir story takes us back to a time when milk was delivered daily to households and businesses by horse and cart. The sound of yesteryear that many of us still remember is the clip-clop of the draught horses pulling milk wagons through quiet streets before dawn, accompanied by the jangle of bottles in their crates and the sound of running footsteps made by the milky as he ran past the bedrooms of those just waking to drop off his delivery on the back verandas of the kitchens and retrieve empty bottles which were noisily placed in crates on the wagon while the faithful horse kept going slowly through the streets it knew by heart.\n\nDaily routine\n\nRunning a business such as Hanley’s Dairy in the `60s and `70s, before the horse-and-cart days were overtaken by motorised milk trucks, was complex and relied on honest workers dedicated to the smooth running of a stressful daily routine that could easily come undone. It required workers willing to rise at 4am and set to work without delay loading carts from the cool room with milk (bottled or bulk) and cream (bottled), harnessing horses in their stables, leading them to their milk carts and hitching them up; then commencing home deliveries in the pre-dawn to be completed by 8am, when they would return to the dairy and unload and clean the milk carts, all before washing and cleaning and releasing the horses into their turn-out paddocks.\n\nVarious other tasks also had to be completed (some of which were the responsibility of the Hanley children before and after school). These included bringing coal from the backyard coal stack to the kitchen; cleaning the stables, the washroom, and milk carts and trucks; sweeping the landing and loading bay; stabling horses in the late afternoon; delivering late orders; and myriad household jobs. Most importantly, they had to make sure the cool room was ready later in the day for Arthur’s Dairy milk truck from Frankston to deliver the next day’s supply of milk and take away the rinsed and stacked crates of empty bottles, which would be sterilised and re-filled at Arthur’s.\n\nHundreds of sightseers made the long trek out to Wreck Beach to see the dead whale, July 1923. Photos: Wonthaggi & District Historical Society\n\nBy Catherine Watson\n\nOF ALL the objects in the Wonthaggi Museum, this is Mark Robertson’s favourite: a vertebra from the 74ft whale that washed up at Wreck beach, now Harmers Haven, 100 years ago (July 4th, 1923, to be exact) after heavy winter gales.\n\nThe centenary of the whale’s beaching was marked this month in typical Wonthaggi style. The Wonthaggi Hotel, AKA Taberners Hotel or The Whalebones, tied ribbons to the iconic whale jawbones at the front entrance. And on Thursday, members of the Wonthaggi Historical Society gathered for a supper of fish and chips and some good old-fashioned yarning about our whale.\n\nNo 6, left, and No 2 Graham Street, Wonthaggi, 1950s. Janet Akers lived in No 2 after her marrige then moved to No 6. This was the outskirts of Wonthaggi at the time.\n\nBy Janet Akers\n\nWHEN I was married we first lived in No. 2 Graham Street Wonthaggi. There were no neighbours next door on the left side. The railway line connecting the Kirrak mine with the Wonthaggi Railway Station ran behind our house and crossed the road to Inverloch to our left. Next door to our right was No. 6 where my mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law, Pearl and Thelma, lived.\n\n​\n\n​By Eleanor McKay\n\nHAVE you ever wondered why the main street of Cowes is called Thompson Avenue, or just when motorsport became part of Phillip Island's culture?\n\nThe answers to these questions and more can be found in Once upon an island, a collection of 39 stories that chart the history of Phillip Island from 1868.\n\nThe stories were originally conceived and published by the Phillip Island and San Remo Advertiser in 2018 as part of the celebrations to mark 150 years of European settlement.\n\nTHE local significance and tragic history of the No. 20 coal mine shaft site, where 17 miners died, is now memorialised with new signage and in a podcast series documenting the heritage of Wonthaggi.\n\nBass Coast Shire Council and the Wonthaggi and District Historical Society partnered with Storytowns, a group of travel-loving adventurers who record interviews with regional personalities to produce interactive geo-located podcast tours, to create a series about Wonthaggi.\n\nThe Storytowns Wonthaggi History Tour features seven stories about local icons, including the No. 20 Shaft on Bass Highway where 17 men lost their lives in two separate explosions on February 20, 1931 and February 15 1937.​\n\nMr Dinosaur Mike Cleeland. right, with trainee dino hunters at Flat Rocks.\n\nTHIS week a team of \"dino hunters\" embark on the first dinosaur dig at Inverloch since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe team of 20, including leading palaeontologists, researchers and volunteers will start excavating sections of the intertidal (foreshore) zone at Flat Rocks near The Caves, south of Inverloch, looking for fossilised bones and evidence of the prehistoric age.\n\nThe Caves is a well-known site that harbours precious polar dinosaur fossils dating back 126 million years. It will also become one of the sites in the planned Bass Coast Dinosaurs Trail, to celebrate the area’s fascinating pre-historic heritage.\n\nAn inspiration to generations of artists and photographers, the bones of the last remaining brace are a moving reminder of Wonthaggi’s extraordinary mining history.\n\nBy Carolyn Landon\n\n​\n\nWHEN we moved from our farm in the Strzelecki hills to Wonthaggi in 2005 our focus was mainly on the beaches. We would wander from the Channel at Cape Paterson past First and Second Surf beaches towards Harmers Haven, past Wreck Beach where the “biggest whale ever” had been beached and where the rusted ribs left over from the Artisan wreckage lay. It took a bit of time and familiarity for us to discover the path to Williamsons Beach through the scrub followed by the walk to Powlett River, our eyes on the waves and surfers rather than the dunes and nesting birds. Later, with some guidance, we found the path through the bush to Cutlers Beach at the end of Chisholm Road and recognised the middens there spread out over millennia by the Bunurong.\n\nIN November 1909, after the Victorian government established the State Coal Mine, and “the children of Eureka”, as Mr Alf Opie, a pioneer past Secretary of the Dispensary called them, set out to establish a welfare system based on co­-operation and solidarity.\n\nThe Miners Friendly Societies Co-operative Dispensary - better known as The Dispensary\" - was an integral part of this system. The Dispensary celebrates its centenary this month.\n\n​By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Wonthaggi community had a Medical Benefit Fund, a Hospital Benefit Fund based on the principles of dem­ocratic co-operation. All the employees of the State Coal Mine had to be members of these funds. The employees paid compulsory levies and in exchange received free medical and hospital treatment.\n\nBy Carol Cox\n\nVOLUNTEERS for the Wonthaggi & District Historical Society spend much of their time at the Museum – the old railway station – archiving the vast collection the Society has acquired over the more than 50 years it has been in existence.\n\nWhen, a few years ago, they were “beetling away” cataloguing newspapers – mostly Sentinel Times and Powlett Express editions from the past century – they came across interesting news items from the town’s early days. One such is mention of Wonthaggi’s Leek Club, which started in 1927 and ran until World War II.\n\nIn the third and final part of John Bordignon’s memoir of working life of a coal miner, as told to him by Wonthaggi miners, he relates the accidents, near misses and bloody silly pranks that were part of working life underground.\n\nRescue workers at the Number 20 shaft after an explosion killed 13 miners in 1937.\n\nPhoto: Age archives\n\nDURING the entire operation of the mines, over 58 years, about 80 men were killed – a shocking number, but when compared to coal mining throughout the world, Wonthaggi coal Mine was considered one of the safest. Nevertheless, there were thousands of accidents from cut fingers and toes to rocks coming down on you, and there were some amazing, amazing escapes.\n\n​Part 2 of John Bordignon’s memoir of the working life of a coal miner, as told to him by Wonthaggi miners, including his own father.\n\n​WESTERN Area was a very wet mine, not far from the ocean. The miners could work with water dripping on top of them all day long.\n\nThe opposite extreme was Kirrak Area where they had some of the deepest tunnels and they worked in heat about 35° to 40° with 80% humidity. It was murder.\n\n​At Kirrak, Dad and his mate, Blueboy, were putting a connection between two main tunnels that they called a ‘cut-through’. It was in an area they called Siberia. There they were working in a cut through about a metre high and the heat was so intense that they were getting hives all over themselves. You could go in there and work for half an hour/three-quarters of an hour and then get out in better air to recuperate for a while before they had to go back in again. The backs of their knees would just split open from all the sweat as they were kneeling while working. They had to take salt tablets while they worked in that section. Well, that’s the way it was.\n\nBridget Wilson pictured with three of her four surviving children and their children. Jenny believes this was taken on Bridget’s 80th birthday when she went to live with The Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nCAPE Paterson resident Jenny Osler knew little of her great-grandmother, Bridget Wilson, other than that she was Irish and married a Norwegian sailor. All she had was a few family stories and three family photos, taken on Bridget’s 80th birthday.\n\nHer mother had begun the research in pre-computer days. With the help of the Wonthaggi Genealogical Society, Jenny set out to fill in the gaps.\n\n​\n\nShe says her interest in family history research is not in creating a never-ending family tree. but writing the story of her own ancestors within the social and political context of the time.\n\nTHE foreshore kiosk at Cape Paterson served bathers, campers and Cape residents from the mid-1950s until shortly before it was demolished by the council of the day late in 1966. It was built by Bruno Storti to replace the first kiosk which had also been a popular spot but, sadly, had burnt down several years earlier. Bruno with his wife, Mary, ran the kiosk until the late 1950s when Attilio and Irma Storti, together with Irma’s brother Livio (Wazza) Coldebella took over the business.\n\nIt was about then that a beautiful young woman, Janice, one of the Milkins sisters, returned to Wonthaggi after four years of travelling adventures in Europe. She was only 21 years old. She had grown up in Wonthaggi, was an intelligent and precocious student at Wonthaggi Primary School and then the Tech; she was an avid reader, as well as a forward thinker and impatient for life and adventure. She insisted on leaving school after Form 2 [year 8], determined to find a way out of Wonthaggi to travel the world. Through her local doctor, she landed a job in Malvern as an au pair or nanny for the two children – twins – of a university professor on Sabbatical from England."
