        "text": "Botanic gardens at Melbourne and Cranbourne\n\nRoyal Botanic Gardens Victoria are botanic gardens across two sitesâ€“Melbourne and Cranbourne.[1]\n\nMelbourne Gardens was founded in 1846 when land was reserved on the south side of the Yarra River for a new botanic garden. It extends across 38 hectares (94 acres)[2] that slope to the river with trees, garden beds, lakes and lawns. It displays almost 50,000 individual plants representing 8,500 different species.[2] These are displayed in 30 living plant collections.\n\nCranbourne Gardens was established in 1970[3] when land was acquired by the Gardens on Melbourne's south-eastern urban fringe for the purpose of establishing a garden dedicated to Australian plants. A generally wild site that is significant for biodiversity conservation, it opened to the public in 1989.[4] On the 363 hectares (897 acres) site, visitors can explore native bushland, heathlands, wetlands and woodlands.[2] One of the features of Cranbourne is the Australian Garden, which celebrates Australian landscapes and flora through the display of approximately 170,000 plants from 1,700 plant varieties.[2] It was completed in 2012.[2]\n\nRoyal Botanic Gardens Victoria is home to the State Botanical Collection, which is housed in the National Herbarium of Victoria. The collection, which includes 1.5 million preserved plants, algae and fungi, represents the largest herbarium collection in Australia and wider Oceania.[5] It also includes Australia's most comprehensive botanical library.[6]\n\nThe gardens are governed under the Royal Botanic Gardens Act 1991 by the Royal Botanic Gardens Board,[3] who are responsible to the Minister for Environment.\n\nIn 1846 Charles La Trobe selected the site for the Royal Botanic Gardens from marshland and swamp.[7]\n\nIn 1857 the first director was Ferdinand von Mueller, who created the National Herbarium of Victoria and brought in many plants.[7]\n\nIn 1873 William Guilfoyle became Director and changed the style of the Gardens to something more like the picturesque gardens that were around at that time. He added tropical and temperate plants.[7]\n\nIn 1877 Sir Edmund Barton, Australia's first Prime Minister and Jane Ross were married at the Royal Botanic Gardens.\n\nIn 1924 a shooting massacre occurred at the Gardens resulting in the death of four people.[8][9]\n\nIn June 2015 the Gardens brought together the elements of the organisation under the name Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, incorporating Melbourne Gardens, Cranbourne Gardens, the National Herbarium of Victoria and the Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology.[10]\n\nLiving collections at Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne include:[11]\n\nAotearoa New Zealand\n\nAraucariaceae\n\nAustralian Forest Walk\n\nAustralian Rare and Threatened Species\n\nCacti and Succulent\n\nCamellia\n\nClimate Ready Rose Collection\n\nCycad\n\nEucalypt\n\nFern Gully\n\nGardens House\n\nGrey Garden\n\nGuilfoyle's Volcano\n\nHerb and Medicinal\n\nThe Ian Potter Foundation Children's Garden\n\nLower Yarra Rivver Habitat\n\nNorth American Drylands\n\nPalm\n\nPerennial Border\n\nQuercus\n\nSouthern Africa\n\nSouthern China\n\nTerrestrial Orchid Collection\n\nThe gardens include a mixture of native and non-native vegetation which invariably hosts a diverse range of both native and non-native fauna. The gardens host over 10,000 floral species, the majority being non-native species. The gardens were the origin from which many introduced species spread throughout south-eastern Australia as seeds were traded between early European botanists in the mid-19th century, studying the Australian flora.\n\nFrom the establishment of the gardens in 1846, much of the native vegetation was removed as botanists such as Baron Von Mueller planted a range of species from around the world. While initially much of the native wetlands and swamplands in the gardens were left, around the turn of the 20th century these were re-landscaped to create the Ornamental Lake. Despite this, however, there are some large eucalypts remaining including the prominent Separation Tree, a 300-year-old River Red Gum, under which Victoria was declared a separate colony. In August 2010 the Separation Tree was attacked by vandals[12] and then attacked again in 2013, by 2015 it was dead and removal of the canopy and branches commenced.[13][14] The Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne focus solely on Australian native plants.\n\nThe Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne were initially intended to be a horticultural exhibition for the public to enjoy, many seeds were traded between early European botanists such as Arthur and Von Mueller, who planted non-native species. The Queen and her grandfather, Dame Nellie Melba and Paderewski contributed plantings on occasions throughout the history of the gardens.\n\nSince its earliest days, the Royal Botanic Gardens is involved in plant research and identification. This is done primarily through the National Herbarium of Victoria, which is based at the Gardens. The Herbarium is also home to the State Botanical Collection, which includes over 1.5 million dried plant specimens,[5] and an extensive collection of books, journals and artworks. Research findings are published in the journal Muelleria, which is a scientific representation of the work done in the Gardens in any one year. More recently, the Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology has been established to look at plants that grow in urban environments specifically.\n\nThe 5,000-square-metre (54,000 sq ft) Ian Potter Foundation Children's Garden is designed as a discovery area for children of all ages and abilities. The Ian Potter Children's Garden, named for the Ian Potter Foundation, is based in South Yarra, off the main site. This area is closed for two months of the year from the end of the Victorian July school holidays for rest and maintenance.[15]\n\nIn 2004 or 2005[16] The Magic Pudding sculpture, by Louis Laumen, was unveiled in the garden. The concept for the garden was developed by Simon H. Warrender (son of Simon George Warrender and Pamela Warrender), who also commissioned the sculpture, through Committee for Melbourne's Future Focus Group, which was founded by Pamela.[17] Simon Warrender announced the establishment of the annual prizes to be awarded by his Melbourne Prize Trust at the unveiling.[16]\n\nEastern Lawn\n\nFern Gully\n\nA section of the gardens in winter\n\nOak Lawn\n\nThe Herb Garden\n\nThe Terrace Restaurant\n\nThe main entrance gate\n\nRoyal Botanic Gardens Melbourne"
