        "text": "(From the S. M. Herald.)\n\nThe expedition of A. C. Gregory, who, in 1855\n\n1856 surveyed the upper part of the Victoria River,\n\nin Northern Australia, and the country in the vicinity\n\nof its banks, brings before us one of the most remark-\n\nable men who ever visited these coasts—we mean\n\nFerdinand von Mueller, the Government Botanist of\n\nVictoria, and director of the Botanical Garden in\n\nMelbourne. This indefatigable botanist and zealous\n\nexplorer accompanied Mr. Gregory, and co-operated\n\nwith him amidst all the disasters and difficulties\n\nwhich that expedition encountered by sea and by\n\nland. Mr. Gregory, as is well known, displayed much\n\nenergy of character in extricating himself and party\n\nfom the horrors of shipwreck and the miseries of a\n\ndreary sandstone country; and, as he advanced into\n\nthe interior he had the satisfaction of finding that\n\nthe character of the climate and the fertility of\n\nthe soil still continued to improve. The botanical\n\nreport, composed by Dr. F. von Mueller on the return\n\nof the party, and read before the Linnean Society\n\nin 1857, is the work of a master mind, and one\n\nof the most important documents ever published in\n\nconnection with the botany of Northern Australia.\n\nFrom that document we learn that the Doctor,\n\nin that portion of his travels, added 800 species\n\nto the flora of Australia, and appended to his\n\ncommunication two very useful lists of plants. In\n\nthe first he determined the Northern limits of 243\n\nspecies from the Southern latitudes of Australia,\n\nwhich gradually appeared on the lines of exploration\n\nfrom latitude 17.80 S. to latitude 27 S.; and in the\n\nsecond he furnished a systematical catalogue of nearly\n\nall the genera of plants observed during the journey,\n\nwith their respective number of species. Dr. F. von\n\nMueller has now been engaged for twenty-two years\n\nin investigating the vegetabel kingdom of Australia,\n\nand certainly, since the days of Robert Brown, the\n\ncelebrated botanist of Flinders' expedition, no one\n\nhas done so much to elucidate the peculiar features\n\nof our Australian orders, or to furnish elaborate de-\n\nscriptions of new species. Ferdinand von Mueller is\n\na native of Northern Germany, and, as both of his\n\nparents died from pulmonary consumption when he\n\nwas yet in tender years and possessed of very slender\n\nmeans, his early career was one of struggle and diffi-\n\nculty. By the force, however, of great natural\n\nabilities, aided by indomitable perseverance, he soon\n\nacquired distinction amongst his competitors of the\n\nsame standing, and at the early age of fourteen com-\n\nmenced his botanical researches on a part of the\n\ndukedom of Schleswig, and from 1840 to 1846 fur-\n\nnished no inconsiderable contributions to the Danish\n\nFlora. Being of a delicate constitution, and unable\n\nto endure the rigour of a European winter, he was\n\ncompelled, on leaving the University, to seek to a\n\nwarmer climate. It was a source of deep regret to him\n\nat the time, as his reputation was becoming established,\n\nand he had before him the most brilliant prospects of\n\nsuccess: However, there was no alternative, for he\n\nfelt that he could not live through another winter in\n\nthe chilly parts of North Germany. He was induced,\n\nmoreover, to leave Europe, in order, if possible, to\n\nprolong the life of an affectionate sister - a lady of\n\nremarkable genius and gentle disposition, to whom he\n\nwas fondly attached—who has since passed away, we\n\ntrust, to a region where disease and pain are unknown.\n\nThe providential circumstances which thus drove Dr.\n\nvon Mueller from the scenes of his childhood, and\n\nthe pleasing associations of his youthful efforts, have\n\nproved of the deepest interest to Australia; for no\n\nsooner did he land on this continent than he became\n\nfascinated with its vegetation, and, instead of returning\n\nhome after a few years, as he had originally contem-\n\nplated, he has become permanently settled amongst\n\nus: From 1847 to 1852 he examined in its full extent\n\nthe Flora of South Australia, relying solely on his\n\nprivate resources and the occasional assistance of\n\ngenerous friends, without any support from the\n\nGovernment of that colony! In process of time, he\n\nextended his field researches over 25,000 miles; and\n\npartly by his own exertions, and partly by utilising the\n\ncollections of others, he accumulated a material—now\n\npermanently located in the department over which he\n\npresides—so varied and extensive, that he began to\n\nthink seriously of elaborating a work on the plants of\n\nAustralia, provided that the final identifications could\n\nbe affected by comparisons with R. Brown's and Cun-\n\nningham's collections, as well as with Indian ones which\n\nhe deemed as important as his own. Those of Drum-\n\nmond and Preise he had almost completely investi-\n\ngated, with many others from all parts of this con-\n\ntinent. Having such resources at hand, he was\n\npreparing to commence a grand work on the Flora of\n\nAustralia, but, with a feeling of generosity which does\n\nhim as much honour as his most interesting dis-\n\ncoveries, he relinquished the main task to Mr.\n\nBentham; the president of the Linnean Society, when\n\nthat illustrious man, on the death of Robert Brown,\n\nresolved to prepare the Flora Australiensis on the\n\nbasis of the British collections, though it is a fact\n\nworthy of being recorded, the collections obtained\n\nsince the time of Sir Joseph Banks are less ex-\n\ntensive than those which the doctor himself has\n\ntreasured up, and which are now affording Mr.\n\nBentham so much assistance in the preparation of\n\nthis great work. And these collections, it must be\n\nborne in mind, are exclusive of the numerous\n\nspecimens of plants, which from time to time he\n\nhas forwarded to Kew, and other places of Europe.\n\nThe task of describing the Flora of Australia—(a work\n\nnot even accomplished for civilised Europe, no de-\n\nscriptive Flora of that portion of the globe as yet\n\nbeing in existence)—involved great sacrifices; but\n\nthe Doctor was not reluctant to make them for the\n\npromotion of his darling object. He has devoted\n\ntwenty-two years—the best years, it may be said, of\n\nhis life—to the collection of material, and, rising\n\nabove the sordid love of money, so prevalent in\n\nthese colonies, he has expended a private fortune for\n\nthe advancement of scientific knowledge. And yet\n\n—noble and generous man—he thinks that he has his\n\nreward in the simple yet suggestive reflection, that\n\nscarcely a square mile in all Australia yet explored\n\ncan be found where the plants do not testify of his\n\nexertions. He has added about 2000 species to those\n\npreviously known from Australia, one-half from his\n\nown travels, and the remainder from the accumulated\n\nmaterial of contributors. The majority of these have\n\nbeen described by the Doctor himself; whilst many\n\nof the monocotyledoneae remain yet to be published\n\nfrom notes in his possession. Nor must it be for-\n\ngotten that, in addition to the labour of describing\n\nnew plants, he has re-examined, and partly rearranged,\n\nall the older plants to the number of 7000. From the\n\nvarious reports published by him, especially the\n\ndocuments relating to the Exhibition, it will be\n\nperceived that the Doctor has also rendered valu-\n\nable assistance to industrial pursuits connected\n\nwith Australian vegetation, and he has said that,\n\nshould the Almighty spare his life for such a pur-\n\npose, he will endeavour, as a crowning work of his\n\ndays, to trace out, as his present material admits,\n\nthe geological relation of our native vegetation over\n\nthe continent. As an author, Dr. F. von Mueller is\n\nas eminent as an explorer and botanist; for his\n\nnumerous works, composed as they have been amidst\n\nthe distracting occupations of official duties, testify\n\nto his scientific skill and untiring energy. He has\n\nnearly completed six volumes of his Fragmenta\n\nPhytographia Australia, a work written in Latin, for\n\nthe information of the learned in all parts of the\n\nworld, and illustrated by accurate figures of remark-\n\nable species. He is also the author of a splendid\n\nvolume on \"The Plants Indigenous to Victoria,\"\n\nwith suitable illustrations, and another large volume\n\nof engravings with additional drawings, entitled \"Litho-\n\ngrams.\" Then again, besides the four volumes of the\n\nFlora Australiensis, to which he has so largely con-\n\ntributed, he has published \"The Vegetation of the\n\nChatham Islands ;\" a small volume on \"Australian\n\nMosses\"; \"Botanical Report on the North Australian\n\nExpedition, under the command of A. C. Gregory,\n\nEsq.\"; \"Monograph of the Eucalypti of Tropical\n\nAustralia, with an arrangement for the use of colonists\n\naccording to the structure of the bark;\" \"Contribu-\n\ntiones ad Acaciarum Australiae Cognitionem\"; \"A\n\nRecord of Plants collected by Mr. Pemberton Walcott\n\nand Mr. Maitland Brown, in the year 1861, during\n\nMr. F. Gregory's Exploring Expedition into North\n\nWest Australia\"; \"Report on the Plants collected\n\nduring Mr. Babbage's Expedition into the North-\n\nWestern interior of South Australia in 1858\";\n\n\"Essay on the Plants collected by Mr. Eugene\n\nFitzalan, during Lieutenant Smith's Expedition to the\n\nEstuary of the Burdekin\"; \"Botanical Paper relative\n\nto the Expedition in search of Dr. Leichhardt;\"\n\n\"Documents relating to the Intercolonial Exhibition;\"\n\nelaborate \"Annual Reports of the Melbourne Botanical\n\nGarden;\" Lectures on the \"Rust in Wheat;\" \"The\n\nFate of Leichhardt,\" &c., &c., and numerous contribu-\n\ntions to the scientific magazines of Victoria. After enu-\n\nmerating the Doctor's labours in the field, and the result\n\nof his literary exertions in the study, the Australian,\n\npublic will think that the title \"Prince of Australian\n\nBotanists\" was most appropriately bestowed upon him\n\nby the late Sir William Hooker; nor will those who\n\nare acquainted with his simple and unaffected habits,\n\nhis kindness of heart, and his courtesy to every one,\n\nhow humble soever he may be, — differ from the"
