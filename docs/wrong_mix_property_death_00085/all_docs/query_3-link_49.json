As well as collecting his own specimens, Sonder purchased and traded botanical specimens with other botanists and plant collectors across the globe, amassing an impressive personal herbarium. \n \nEventually, Sonder's herbarium became too large for him to manage, and he sought out institutions with the funds to purchase it. \n \nAfter more than two decades petitioning the government to buy it, the then-director of the National Herbarium of Victoria, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, acquired the bulk of Sonderâ€™s herbarium in 1883. The Sonder collection, which Mueller described as 'the richest of all private botanical collections in existence', forms an invaluable part of the State Botanical Collection. \n \nThe specimens from Sonderâ€™s herbarium comprise the bulk of the National Herbarium of Victoriaâ€™s non-Australian material, which is currently being databased as part of the Global Collection Project. \n \nAlthough the exact number of specimens in the Sonder herbarium canâ€™t be quantified until the collection has been fully mounted and databased, it is estimated to contain around 300,000 specimens. \n \nOn Sonderâ€™s 212th birthday, herbarium curators are still working with specimens that were part of his extensive botanical collection, ensuring that they are findable and accessible â€“ both in person and online â€“ to herbarium staff and researchers around the globe. \n \nðŸ“·: \n \n1. The Herbarium holds some of the earliest botanical specimens from southern Africa,  South America, and other parts of the world. Unlocking these specimens is critical for supporting research that improves our understanding of â€“ and ability to protect â€“ global plant biodiversity. \n \n2. Over half of the Global Collection remains inaccessible to researchers. Mounting specimens onto archival card is the critical first step in protecting specimens from damage and making them accessible for research.\".",
