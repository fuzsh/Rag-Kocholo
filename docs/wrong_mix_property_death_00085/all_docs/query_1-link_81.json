        "text": "The Smith Family\n\nDr. Louis Lawrence Smith, also known as Dr. L.L.Smith, was a prominent medical professional, parliamentarian and scientific advocate. Among his many achievements, L.L. was also a prominent resident of 'Vermont' (formerly known as 'L.L.Vale') from 1858-1880 where he owned and operated a model farm, 'L.L. Vale', as an orchard and vineyard.\n\nDr. Louis Lawrence Smith (1830-1910)\n\nDr. Louis Lawrence Smith (b. 1830-d. 1910), also known as Dr. L.L. Smith, was born in London on 15th May 1880 to theatre entrepreneur Edward Tyrell Smith and his wife Magdalena Nanetta Gengoult (The Argus, 9th July 1910; Poynter, 2014). Unfortunately, Louis' father Edward would soon abandon mother and child whilst Louis was still an infant and henceforth, Louis was raised by his mother (Poynter, 2014). After receiving his early education at St. Saviour's Grammar School, Louis acquired a medical degree from the Ecole de Medicine in Paris. In 1852, Louis migrated to Australia and after a brief period spent unsuccessfully attempting to find gold in Victoria, established his own surgery in Bourke Street, Melbourne and later at 41 Collins Street, Melbourne (Brennan, 1972). Through his career as a medical practitioner, Dr. L. L. Smith acquired a reputation for his suite of \"patent medicines, painkillers and jars of ointment\" as well as his flamboyant style of self-promotion (Brennan, 1972).\n\nEngraving of Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith (b. 1830-d. 1910) by H.S. Sadd. Source: State Library of Victoria.\n\nDr. Louis Lawrence Smith Purchases Land in Vermont\n\nIn 1858, Dr. L.L. Smith purchased 119 acres of land designated as Lot No. 132 in Canterbury Road, Vermont. He later purchased a neighbouring allotment - Lot No. 123 - which added a further 156 acres to his property adjoining its southern boundary of L.L. Road (now Boronia Road) (Whitehorse Historical Society Newsletter, 1969; Poynter, 2014). The combined triangular parcel of land encompassed an area bounded by Boronia (formerly L.L.Vale Road), Canterbury and Heatherdale Roads and the Dandenong Creek and was to become the site of L.L.'s successful model farm; 'L.L. Vale'. The property boasted a functional orchard, six acres of vineyards as well as plantings of cultivated English grasses (Whitehorse Historical Society Newsletter, 1997; Brennan, 1972).\n\n​In correspondence to his mother Magdalena during December 1858, L.L. described his recent purchase of 'L.L. Vale':\n\n\"I have 119 acres which you will allow is a fine farm or rather will be if ever I can get it into cultivation, it's full of timber, yesterday I rode out to see it and I could not but feel proud to feel myself free, and master of a large tract of land like that with a regular forest on it, and within 14 miles of Melbourne. I purchased it with nearly the last lot of money I had in the bank\" (Poynter, 2014).\n\n​\n\nWinemaking at L.L. Vale\n\n​It is thought that L.L. began cultivating grapes in a small vineyard at L.L. Vale around 1866 (Poynter, 2014). Some years later at the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880-81, L.L. received a second order merit award for his 1879 vintage 'Creme de Boozy' produced from grapes grown at L.L. Vale (Poynter, 2014). L.L. maintained his interest in viticulture throughout his political career, and would come to be held in high regard by Victorian winegrowers due to his staunch promotion of the Victorian wine industry and contribution to the formulation of Australian policies to protect vineyards against Phylloxera; a devastating insect pest on grapevines (Brennan, 1972; Whitehorse Historical Society Newsletter, 1997). When a devastating outbreak of Phylloxera occurred in Geelong in 1877, L.L. quickly advocated the inspection of \"every vineyard in the colony\" to ensure survival of the Victoria's fledgling wine-growing industry in the battle against the disease (Poynter, 2014). From the 25th July 1870, L.L. also served as chairman of the newly established Australian Wine Store and Distillery Company (Poynter, 2014). His efforts soon earned him respect from Victorian winegrowers who were of a mind to petition the Prince of Wales himself to 'recognise the Hon. L.L. Smith as the representative of the wine industry of Victoria' (Poynter, 2014).\n\nVictorian Champagne Company (Limited)\n\nIn 1877, French winemaker Auguste d’Argente (b.1827-d.1884) arrived in Victoria with the intention of developing a sparkling wine production. Prior to his arrival to Australia, Auguste had accumulated an acclaimed 40 years of experience. His project was received with very little enthusiasm except for Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith who recognized the potential of this new industry in Victoria. Dr. L. L. Smith henceforth employed Auguste from 1878 to serve as Manager of his wine-making vineyards and production facilities.\n\nOne of the first sparkling wines developed by Auguste for Dr. L.L. Smith was made from grapes grown at the ‘L.L. Vale’ vineyard in Vermont. Together, Auguste and Dr. Smith agreed upon the name ‘Crème de Bouzy’ for the new beverage as a reference to the French town of Bouzy. The wine itself, which was a sparkling rose-coloured Burgundy, won second prize at the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880-1881.\n\nDr. L.L. Smith was keen to capitalize on the success of their new product and thus offered for sale, selected shares from his company, the Victorian Champagne Company, to members of the Melbourne Society; many of whom were politicians, actors, and lawyers. The company itself had cellars in the Eastern market corner of Bourke and Exhibition Streets which were grandly titled the ‘Champagne Manufactory’.\n\nIn 1882, Dr. L.L. Smith sent Auguste to Epernay, France, to recruit three skilled assistants from the wine districts to return to Australia to work at the vineyard at ‘L.L. Vale’ (The Argus, 30th November 1882). The success of the ‘L.L. Vale’ vineyard was cemented further with subsequent awards received both at the Bordeaux Exhibition and later, at the Amsterdam Exhibition. However, this success would ultimately be short-lived with the sudden passing in late 1884, of Auguste d’Argente at the age of 57. As a result, the Victorian Champagne Company, which had been active a mere six years between 1878-1884, entered voluntary liquidation.\n\nDr. Louis Lawrence Smith Is Elected to Parliament\n\nIn 1859, Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith entered Parliament as the member for the electorate of South Bourke; a position which he held until his electoral defeat in 1865 (The Argus, 9th July 1910). Among other areas, the electorate of South Bourke also encompassed his model farm 'L.L. Vale' and the surrounding area now known as Vermont. His position as a local member for the area reinforced his status as a prominent local resident of Vermont.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful election attempt in 1868 to regain his electorate of South Bourke, L.L. persisted elsewhere; subsequently serving as the member for Richmond from 1871 to 1874, and again from 1877-1883 (The Argus, 9th July 1910). From 1881 to 1883, whilst representing Richmond, L.L. also held a non-portfolio ministerial position in Sir Bryan O'Loghlen's Ministry (The Argus, 9th July 1910). L.L. would represent yet another new electorate when he became the local member for Mornington from 1886 to 1894; a local government area which also included two of his other model farms in Narre Warren and Upper Beaconsfield (The Argus, 9th July 1910; Poynter, 2014).\n\nThe First School in Vermont\n\nAs a member of Parliament in 1864, Dr. L.L. Smith vouched his assistance to secure a land grant for the building of the Methodist Church in Scotchman’s Hill (later Mount Pleasant and now Forest Hill); thereby playing an important role in the foundation of what was to become the first school in Vermont (School classes were conducted for a time by John Winter in the Mount Pleasant Chapel from June 12th, 1865, and later by the first head teacher of the Vermont State School; Mr. John Brown, from January 1865) (Brennan, 1972).\n\nVermont or L.L. Vale?\n\nIn addition to his model farm 'L.L. Vale' in Vermont, Dr. L.L. Smith also owned an additional two model farms: a property in Narre Warren and an estate called 'Louisville' in Upper Beaconsfield (Poynter, 2014). He also leased a 4,000 acre property located in Lilydale from the Victorian government of which he used to graze cattle (Poynter, 2014).\n\nHowever, in order to focus on his political career, Dr. L.L. Smith began to sell his various land holdings across Melbourne from 1877. In 1880, he sold his model farm in Vermont. The following is the sale bill for L.L. Smith's model farm, L.L.Vale:\n\n\"Lot 1. Farm on Dandenong Creek, 12 1/2 miles from Melbourne, of about 280 acres. It has been used as a model farm by Dr. Smith, who has spent nearly £25,000 on it. It is well fenced, waterholes made and there is a running creek through it to the Dandenong Creek. The orchards have two thousand fruit trees, including oranges, loquats and chestnuts. There are also gooseberries and raspberries. Paddocks are sown in English grass, oats, marigolds, Belgian silver beet, peas etc. There is also a plantation of a newly-discovered food plant, Prickly Comfrey, which is in full leaf, yielding one hundred and eight tons to the acre. The homestead is a six-roomed cottage, set in a fruit and vegetable garden of three acres, with stabling for six horses, piggeries, hay, produce and sheep sheds, which all have floors of asphalt. There is also about six acres of vineyard and vines in good order.\n\nLot 2. All that magnificent piece of land known as \"The Hill\" in Canterbury Road, just before Delany's Hotel, commanding a view of the Heads, Schnapper Point, the bay and the whole of Melbourne. Choicest piece of land, for grandeur of view, within seven miles of Melbourne\" (Whitehorse Historical Society Newsletter, 1969).\n\n​Despite the departure of Dr. L.L. Smith from Vermont in 1880, his influence endured when a year later on November 1st, 1881, local resident Thomas Bowen opened a new post office named L.L. Vale. Due to the growing consensus to decide on a single name for the locality which at the time was alternately known as Vermont and L.L.Vale, it was soon renamed the Vermont Post Office. Whilst the name Vermont had found favour in recent times, for example with the opening of the Vermont State School No. 1022 in 1869, the locality was still referred to as L.L. Vale in honour of the reputation and legacy of Dr. L.L. Smith and his model farm, until 1889 when the official name of Vermont was accepted.\n\nDr. Louis Lawrence Smith's Other Model Farms\n\nDr. L.L. Smith owned a total of three model farms: L.L. Vale in Vermont, a property in Narre Warren and an estate called Louisville in Upper Beaconsfield (Poynter, 2014). Louisville was named by L.L. as a tribute to his French heritage, and was remembered by his son Harold as boasting fertile land able to grow vegetables, grapes, cherries, peaches, plums, apricots, apples and nuts (Poynter, 2014). Various animals were also bred on the property and included pigs, cows, poultry and approximately sixty Shetland ponies (Poynter, 2014). The house constructed on the property was grand with \"marble mantlepieces and crystal chandeliers\" and a greenhouse \"covered by wisteria and 60 feet long [serving] as a space for large dinners and included a dance floor\" (Poynter, 2014). An \"avenue of trees, each one planted by some distinguished visitors, stretched from the gate to the house\" and the surrounding property featured a gully and waterfall (Poynter, 2014).\n\nAdditional Interests and Causes\n\nL.L. Smith had a variety of interests and causes which he advocated for during his parliamentary career and as a high profile member of Victorian society. He espoused the need for free and compulsory education and was \"emphatic that trades, and agriculture, be taught in schools\" (Poynter, 2014). Through his engagement in the promotion of the Victorian wine industry, he also assisted in forming key Australian policies to protect against the Phylloxera insect pest which threatened to decimate vineyards across Victoria (Poynter, 2014).\n\n​L.L. was also invested in the sustainability of Victoria's natural resources; namely forests and fisheries. In various appeals, he raised awareness of issues governing water supply and destruction of native forests; urging his fellow Victorians to \"consider those who are coming after us\" and to \"take care that we do not destroy that which beneficent Providence has blessed us with\" (Poynter, 2014). As noted by Tim Shambrook, Dr. L. L. Smith was also the first to author the bills \"to regulate and preserve fisheries\" and later founded the Melbourne Fish Market (Shambrook, 2010).\n\n​\n\n​As both an admirer and close friend of Government Botanist Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, L.L. Smith also advocated for scientific discovery and endeavour​ on numerous occasions; for example supporting Baron von Mueller's proposal of Antarctic Exploration to advance geological science at the time of the First International Polar Year in 1882-1883; an initiative that whilst ultimately unsuccessful, was ahead of its time with the first Antarctic Exploration Expedition not completed until after L.L.'s death in 1911 (Poynter, 2014). Von Mueller listed L.L. Smith as a \"contributor of plants and seeds to the Botanic Gardens in 1864 and 1865\" (Poynter, 2014). In 1881, Dr. L. L. Smith became a trustee of the Melbourne Exhibition Building (now the Royal Exhibition Building) following its inaugural major exhibition, and later served as chairman of trustees from 1884-1909 (Meehan, 2014; Poynter, 2014). A commemorative bust of Dr. L.L. Smith completed in 1914 by Sir Bertram Mackennal now stands at the Melbourne Exhibition Building.\n\nRetirement of Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith\n\nIn 1894, after a total of 34 years spent serving in the Victorian parliament, Dr. L. L. Smith retired aged 64 (Shambrook, 2010). Dr. L. L. Smith sadly passed away of pneumonia at East Melbourne on 8th July, 1910, at the age of 80. During his lifetime, Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith was married twice; first to Sarah Ann Taylor (b. 1839-d. 1882) and secondly to Marion Jane (Polly) Higgins (b. 1854).\n\nLouise Hanson-Dyer (nee Smith) (1884-1962)\n\nL.L.'s daughter by second wife Polly; Louise Berta Mosson Hanson-Dyer (nee Smith) (b. 1884-d. 1962) received an education across various institutions including: Presbyterian Ladies College (PLC), Alliance Francaise and the Melbourne Conservatorium in Albert Street as well as from various instructors in London and Glasgow (Kaleva, 2020). Her aptitude for musical studies lead her to become a professional pianist and among her professional music performances were occasional soirees at Alliance Francaise (Poynter, 2014). After settling in Paris, Louise founded 'Les Editions de L'Oiseau-Lyre' in 1932 which began publishing historical music scores and later recordings by both historic and modern composers. She received the Legion of Honour title 'Chevalier' in 1934, and later the title of 'Officier'​ in 1957 (Poynter, 2014).\n\nLouise Hanson-Dyer (b. 1884-d. 1962) daughter of Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith circa 1920s.\n\n​Source: Beaconsfield Historical Society.\n\nLouise met her future first husband; scotsman James Dyer, whilst accompanying her father, L.L. Smith, on an expedition to Auckland on the ship Westralia during a school vacation (Poynter, 2014). However, unbeknownst to either party at the time, the couple would not meet each other again for several years until a chance encounter at the races reunited them and they married twelve years later in 1911 (Poynter, 2014). They remained married until James' death in 1938.\n\nHarold Gengoult-Smith (1890-1983)\n\nL.L.'s son by second wife Polly; Sir Harold Gengoult-Smith (b. 1890-d. 1983), attended the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School in St. Kilda Road from 1904 to 1909. He later left Melbourne in 1913 to commence studies in Medicine at Edinburgh which he resumed some years later following his service in the 2nd Dragoon Guards during the First World War (Poynter, 2014). Upon his return to Melbourne, Harold practiced medicine and became engaged in local politics; and eventually became Lord Mayor of Melbourne from the 9th November 1931 to the 9th November 1934. ​Like his father, Harold was also a trustee of the Melbourne Exhibition Building of which he remained a member for forty-three years; and saved the structure from demolition with his casting vote during a crucial vote that took place to decide future of the building (Poynter, 2014).\n\nIn 1936, Dr. L. L. Smith's son Sir Harold Gengoult Smith and his wife Lady Cynthia Gengoult Smith (nee Brookes); daughter of prominent tennis player Sir Norman Brookes, visited the Vermont State School No. 1022 to present a commemorative picture \"representing pupils who attended the school in 1896\" (Blackburn and Mitcham Reporter, 24th April 1936).\n\nSir Harold Gengoult Smith (b. 1890-d. 1983), son of Dr. Louis Lawrence Smith.
