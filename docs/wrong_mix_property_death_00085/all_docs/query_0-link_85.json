        "text": "The Rooks Family\n\nThe Rooks family were early pioneering settlers in the Vermont area. Abraham Rooks emigrated from a small village in Cambridgeshire, England and arrived in Australia in 1857. His grandson, Charles Francis Rooks, served as the Mayor of Nunawading from 1946-1947 and from 1955-1956.\n\n1854-1857: The Rooks Family Emigrate to Australia\n\nIn 1854, Abraham's older brother, Francis Rooks (b. 1817) and his family boarded the \"Tudor\" ship and emigrated to Australia, arriving at Aitkens Creek on 30th December 1854 (Castle Camps, 2020b). Shortly after in 1857*, Abraham (b. 1824) and his wife Sarah, alongside his younger brothers Isaac and Jacob, and other family members, boarded the \"Grand Trianon\" ship and emigrated to Victoria, Australia (Wiki Tree, 2020). Following their arrival in Australia in May 1857, the brothers began their journey to secure newly available land for selection and spent their first night at Damper Creek (now Gardiner's Creek) in Burwood, Victoria (Castle Camps, 2020a; Wiki Tree, 2020). Damper Creek acquired its name after damper was prepared on the banks of the creek by Indigenous Australians with the use of their flour rations (Brennan, 1972).\n\n*According to Sydenham (1990), Abraham Rooks came to Australia from Cambridgeshire, England in 1862. However, this date is reasoned to be incorrect based on the fact that Abraham's son, Edmond (b. 1857-d.1929) was born at sea on board the \"Grand Trianon\" during the family's journey by ship to Australia.\n\n1857: Abraham Rooks Selects Land on Scotchman's Hill\n\nAbraham Rooks (b. 1824) subsequently selected and leased 79 acres of land on Scotchman's Hill (now Forest Hill) (Castle Camps, 2020a; Sydenham, 1990). At the time, the land was devoid of basic services and was densely forested, untamed bushland (Sydenham, 1990). After ten years of residing on the property, Abraham succeeded in acquiring a full title to the land for a sum of 80 pounds (Castle Camps, 2020a; Sydenham, 1990; Vermont Football Club, 2020). Abraham found success as a farmer and established a residence located in Mount Pleasant, Nunawading with frontage to Canterbury road (Wills, 2018).\n\n​\n\nScotchman's Hill\n\nScotchman's Hill was a small rise named in honour of its original contingent of six Scottish residents, among whom was David Boyle, a charismatic nurseryman and farmer knowledgeable in Botany who corresponded with Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, the famed designer of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens (Sydenham, 1990; Brennan, 1972). It is possible that Mueller himself bestowed the name of 'Vermont' to the suburb whilst riding with Boyle on Delaney's Road (now Canterbury Road) (Sydenham, 1990; Brennan, 1972). Boyle also served as secretary of the Mount Pleasant Committee in support of the development of the first school in the Vermont district (Brennan, 1972).\n\n1864-1865: Construction of the Wesleyan Chapel\n\nThe pioneering Boyle, McClare and Rooks families collaborated with other members of the local community to construct the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel with a meeting held in August 1864 to discuss the plans for the construction of the Church held at the residence of Francis Rooks (Sydenham, 1990; Brennan, 1972; Shambrook, 1987). Dr. L.L. Smith, then serving as Member of Parliament, assisted in obtaining a land grant for the project (Brennan, 1972). A committee was formed to manage the construction of the Church, and included Ab Rooks, John Matters, Joseph Orr and Reverend J.B.Smith (Brennan, 1972). Once completed, the Church opened its doors to the community in June 1865 (Sydenham, 1990). ​Prior to the construction of the Church, worship services were held at the Rooks' family home (Sydenham, 1990). The Wesleyans also constructed Wesley College, Queen's College and Methodist Lady's College in Victoria (Brennan, 1972).\n\n1872: Opening of the Vermont School\n\nAbraham Rooks (b.1824) is also recognised as one of the founding members on the committee for the Vermont School, which was built in 1870 (Vermont Football Club, 2020). The school was initially proposed to form part of the Mount Pleasant Church on the same site however, after a local school inspector deemed the site inadequate, the school was instead developed on the corner of Mitcham and Canterbury Roads on land purchased on November 20th 1869 by the Mount Pleasant Committee (Brennan, 1972; Shambrook, 1987). The completed school accepted its first cohort of students in 1872 and was known as the 'Vermont School' (Shambrook, 1987).\n\nDonation of the Vermont Recreation Reserve\n\nAubrey Rooks, grandson of Abraham (b. 1824), recalls how Abraham Rooks (b. 1824) generously donated the site of the current Vermont Football Club Oval, Cricket and Recreation ground located on the corner of Canterbury and Terrara roads, to the community of Vermont (Vermont Football Club, 2020). The site was originally a dense bush block but was subsequently cleared by hand using \"axe and crosscut saw\" by a dedicated team volunteers comprising of local men from the Vermont area, two of whom were Mr. Pat D'Arcy and Mr. Norm Williamson (Vermont Football Club, 2020). The team also levelled the site using \"horse drawn ploughs, scoops, harrows and rollers\" (Vermont Football Club, 2020). Aubrey passed away on the 31st July 1989 (Knox City Council, 2016).\n\n1889: Death of Abraham Rooks and the Rooks Legacy\n\nAbraham passed away at his residence on 1st September 1889 at the age of 65 and was buried at the Box Hill Cemetery in Victoria (Wills, 2018; Wiki Tree, 2020).\n\nRooks Road\n\nIn recognition of Abraham Rooks' status as a pioneer English settler and landowner in the Vermont area, 'Rooks' road was named in his honour (Whitehorse Historical Society, 2020).\n\nThe above image is a section of the 1892 Parish of Nunawading Map (Scale = 40 chains to 1 inch). The Rooks' family property is bound by Rooks road on one side. Mrs. S. Rooks refers to Sarah (nee Cowell) Rooks (b. 1828-d.1896), wife of Abraham Rooks (b. 1824-d.1889). After Sarah passed away in 1896, she bequeathed \"to her son Abraham, the Old Homestead as it stands with about 5 acres including furniture and effects. The balance of the land to be sold and divided equally between sons John, William, Charles and Henry\" (Castle Camps, 2020c).\n\nKey: Blue = Springvale Road, Brown = Canterbury Road, Orange = Now Rooks Road, Light Green = L.L.

Like his father Abraham Rooks, he was also one of eleven children. In 1897, Abe married his second cousin once removed, Emily Ellen Rooks (Castle Camps, 2020a; Vermont Football Club, 2020).

He played football for the Vermont Football Club until 1929 when difficult circumstances caused by the Great Depression forced him to leave the Vermont area in search of work (Tribal Pages, 2020; Vermont Football Club, 2020). On his return, he served as a Committee member for the Vermont Football Club until the early 1950s (Vermont Football Club, 2020). Aubrey Rooks was also a local builder in the Vermont district and in the mid 1950s constructed the residence at 21 Frances Avenue for a local Vermont Veteran (Docking Real Estate, 2014).\n\nResidence at 21 Frances Avenue, Vermont constructed by Aubrey Rooks in the mid 1950s.\n\nGordon Garfield and Mervyn Richard Rooks\n\nAubrey's brothers, Gordon Garfield (b. 1906-d. 1960) and Mervyn Richard (Dick) (b. 1911-d. 1992) both served as trainers at the Vermont Football Club in the 1940s (Vermont Football Club, 2020).

In 1925, the Vermont Queen Carnival was held in an effort to raise funds for planned improvements to the Vermont Recreation Reserve (Sydenham, 1990). Young women from the Vermont area vied for the title of Queen which was awarded to the individual who raised the most money (Sydenham, 1990). Miss Marjorie Grant was crowned the Queen of Tennis, Miss Ina Rooks the Queen of Football and Miss Dorothy Armstrong the Queen of Progress (Sydenham, 1990). They were each awarded a gold bangle in appreciation for their fundraising efforts (Sydenham, 1990). A sum exceeding £84 was raised to assist \"the people of Vermont to make their recreation ground worthy of the district\" (Sydenham, 1990; Box Hill Reporter, 1925).\n\nReferences"
