There are seven lots of stereographs, not least a group of 17 Australasian Stereo Views (circa 1892) by the little-known South Australian photographer Edwin C. Thomas. Other original photographs include aerial views of First World War trench warfare, early cartes de visite of Paris, an exhibition print by Charles Mountford of great Indigenous interest, and a signed portrait of Spencer Tracy.\n\nWe could go on, but why not just sit back, make yourself comfortable, and take it all in at your own pace!"
