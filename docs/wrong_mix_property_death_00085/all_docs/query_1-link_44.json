        "text": "Taken in 1861, looking South West over the southern part of Melbourne, and out to Port Phillip Bay. Collins Street starts at this intersection with Spring Street and heads off up slightly to the right. Spring Street runs from left to right. In the distance on the right hand side of the photograph, you can see dozens of sailing ships near Port Melbourne.\n\nThe high brick fence and garden (on the left of the photo) belonged to Dr Godfrey Howitt (1800-73), physician and natural scientist. Howitt had studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and practised in both Leicester and Nottingham. In 1839 he emigrated with his family to Melbourne and, like Lieutenant Governor La Trobe, brought a pre-fabricated house with him. In 1845 he acquired land at the corner of Collins and Spring streets where he erected his home and established a large garden which extended to Flinders Lane. Howitt was involved with the Melbourne Hospital from its establishment and was President and Honorary Physician of the Benevolent Asylum in North Melbourne. In recognition of his contribution to the study of botany and entomology, the Government Botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller, named a native mallow flower \"Howittia\" after him. After Howitt's death, his land was subdivided and in 1877 the building which occupies the site today was constructed.\n\nJust to give you an idea of the traffic up and down Port Phillip Bay, eight years earlier in 1853, The Argus of 27th June lists the following ships in Hobson's Bay:\n\nVESSELS IN HOBSON'S BAY.\n\nJune 26th, 1853.\n\nSHIPS.\n\nH.
