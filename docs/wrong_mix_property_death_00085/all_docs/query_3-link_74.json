        "text": "Friedrichshafen, June 30, 2023. The Zeppelin Group’s corporate values can be traced back to the well-known aviation pioneer Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin. The establishment of the Zeppelin Foundation in 1908 by Ferdinand von Zeppelin made it possible to launch today's Zeppelin Group in 1950 (at that time under the name \"Metallwerk Friedrichshafen\"). The \"Grafensätze\" (our principles), which go back to the life of Ferdinand von Zeppelin, accompany Zeppelin employees worldwide through their day-to-day work. They are a reminder of the values that still characterize the Group today. One of these principles is: Grafen move your heart. This motto is the perfect complement to the departure of Rochus Hofmann, who after almost 20 years of service at Zeppelin Systems, will take well-deserved retirement on July 1, 2023.\n\nWith the acquisition of Motan in 2004, Rochus Hofmann found his way to Zeppelin Systems and has remained loyal to the company ever since. When the newly acquired company was restructured, Hofmann successfully contributed his many years of industry and management experience and quickly gained a good reputation both internally and among customers. Applying his intense focus to the needs and expectations of national and international customers, as Managing Director he worked on the positioning of the Plant Engineering division and set the course for a successful future. “Giving up is never an option for Rochus Hofmann, and every challenge, whether technical or commercial, was solved with perseverance and the utmost commitment,” says Dr. Markus Vöge, CEO of Zeppelin Systems GmbH.\n\nAfter stepping down from the Management Board of Zeppelin Systems on December 31, 2022, Hofmann spent another six months working as a consultant to the company. Hofmann will retire on July 1, 2023. “Naturally, after my departure, I wish Zeppelin Systems continued good development and the management team all the best and every success in overcoming the many challenges that Plant Engineering faces every day,” says former Managing Director Rochus Hofmann. “Rochus Hofmann deserves the highest recognition for his many years of commitment, and we would like to express our deepest thanks for his extraordinary professional performance,” says Peter Gerstmann, Chairman of the Management Board of the Zeppelin Group. On his retirement, all shareholders, the Supervisory Board and all Zeppelin Systems colleagues, from the bottom of their hearts wish Rochus Hofmann all the best. Grafen move your heart – whether as an active Zeppeliner or in retirement. Once a Zeppeliner, always a Zeppeliner!"
