B Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, Birdwood Avenue, South Yarra, Victoria 3141, Australia. C Corresponding author. Email: john.dowe@jcu.edu.au Warning. Readers of this article are warned that it may contain terms, descriptions and opinions that are culturally sensitive and/or offensive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. John Dallachy (1804–71) was employed by Baron Ferdinand von Mueller to collect plants as a pioneer resident of Cardwell, Rockingham Bay, Queensland, 1864–71. Mueller’s longest-serving paid botanical collector, Dallachy was also the most prolific collector of types among Mueller’s large network of collectors. In part, Dallachy’s success can be attributed to his collecting methods and intensive travels around the species-rich Rockingham Bay area. In part, also, Dallachy was indebted to fellow European pioneers for support (which was acknowledged in the eponymy of new taxa), and to local Indigenous and South Sea Islander people. Dallachy managed these relationships in a context of frontier war as local Indigenous people resisted being displaced by European colonists. Nevertheless, Dallachy’s opportunity to work as a full-time professional botanical collector, and the rapidity with which his new specimens were identified and published was, to a large extent, due to Mueller. The partnership with Mueller led to Dallachy contributing ,3500 specimens from Rockingham Bay to the Melbourne Herbarium of which ,400 taxa were considered new to Western science. Published online 7 February 2020 Introduction John Dallachy (1804–71) was the first European botanical collector to permanently reside in what is one of Australia’s most floristically diverse areas, the Wet Tropics Bioregion of north-east Queensland, and it is therefore understandable that many new species would be described from the specimens that he collected. Between 1863 and 1871, he was employed by the Melbourne Botanic Garden as a botanical collector in Queensland, 1 under the direction of Baron Ferdinand von Mueller (1825–96), Victorian government botanist and director of the Melbourne Botanic Garden. 2 Previously, 1849– 61, Dallachy had been superintendent and curator of the garden where plant collecting was also included in his duties. As presented in the introductory paper dealing with the biographical background of Dallachy, he left Melbourne under trying circumstances including family problems and alcoholism. His employment as a botanical collector at Rockingham Bay was an opportunity for him to solve or at least control some of these issues. During Dallachy’s time at Rockingham Bay, Mueller, the most significant taxonomist of his time in Australia, was at the height of his botanical productivity, largely driven by his collaboration with George Bentham (1800–84) on preparing Flora Australiensis,a definitive account of Australia’s plants. 3 Mueller had established a large network of collectors who provided him with a supply of specimens from which he described new taxa and then forwarded selected specimens to Bentham for citation in Flora Australiensis. 4 In this second paper on the life and work of John Dallachy we examine the reasons for the successful collaboration between Dallachy and Mueller, including Dallachy’s talent for noticing differences between plants, and for collecting specimens that exhibited the characters that define species. 5 We discuss Dallachy’s interactions with local Indigenous clans that belonged to at least three language groups, the Dyirbal, Warungu and Warrgamay, and with native troopers, who were used by European settlers to enforce the dispossession of Indigenous people from the land. 6 We also identify the contributions of fellow European pioneer settlers to Dallachy’s collecting, and who were acknowledged by Mueller in eponymy. Finally, we present and examine Dallachy’s intensive and relentless itinerary which meant that few botanical novelties were overlooked by him during his time at Rockingham Bay. Rockingham Bay The locality ‘Rockingham Bay’ includes two distinct geographical entities. First, the actual Rockingham Bay (Fig. 1), a curving sandy bay that was named by Lieutenant James Cook RN (1728–79) on 8 1 Lavarack (2019).

As Cook stated: ‘From Cape Sandwich the land trends W. and afterwards N. forming a fine large bay, which I called Rockingham Bay, where there appears to be good shelter, and good anchorage, but I did not stay to examine it’. 7 The bay extends from the northern Hinchinbrook Channel (Oyster Point/Hecate Point) to Tully Heads, a distance of ,25 km. Second, the name was subsequently used by government officials, pastoralists and explorers in reference to a quasi-administrative area that covered most of the official District of Cardwell. 8 Centred on the township of Cardwell (Fig. 2), it included a large expanse of country to the south, west and north of Rockingham Bay proper, taking in the Seaview Range, Herbert River, Cardwell Range, Kirrima Range and Macalister Range to the south, west and north; inland to the Valley of Lagoons; north to Walter Hill Ranges; and the off-shore islands of Goold, Garden, Hinchinbrook, Family Group and Brook Islands, an area that covers ,5000 km 2 . From the south, Rockingham Bay is interrupted by Meunga Creek, which was known as Saltwater Creek in the lower reach, Wreck Creek, Dallachy Creek, Murray River, which was formerly Macalister River, and Tully River which was formerly Mackay River. Although Dallachy frequently provided the location of his collections on his specimen labels, Mueller often cited his collections simply as ‘Rockingham’s Bay. J. Dallachy’ or variations upon that. Preference is here given to location names used by Dallachy on his specimen labels, but in their absence Rockingham Bay is used as a general descriptor. Botanical collections During 1863, Dallachy resided at Rockhampton and then Bowen, and collected ,500 and 400 specimens respectively in and around those locations. 9 In early 1864, he was among 20 European pioneers who settled at Rockingham Bay and he commenced plant collecting immediately upon his arrival. Dallachy’s activities were described by fellow settler Arthur Scott, who noted that Dallachy ‘discovered a great number of new plants already, of which he will forward specimens to Dr Muller, and among them are two new fruits’. 10 0 Approximate route of Cardwell to Cashmere telegraph line Approximate route of Cardwell to Valley of Lagoons track 5 10 15 18°S Kilometres Fig. 1.
