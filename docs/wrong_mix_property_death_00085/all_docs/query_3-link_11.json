        "text": "Tonning. 22nd. March 1841.\n\nMy dear Ferdinand\n\nWondered when I would get your next letter, regret my visit to Husum postponed, I wanted to see Marie Klauders ...\n\nI have one request to make to you. Bertha asked in her letter, for you to come to her Confirmation. Please dear Ferdinand do not be so particular about taking time off. You surely can have another 8 days at time of horse market â bed and everything ready, only you missing! Now you have been at Husum nearly a year.\n\nA fortnight after Easter we are ceasing to wear mourning. Expect you will go on another quarter.\n\nFerdinand I think Bertha has to go to Hamburg to learn Millinery and dressmaking. I think everything will be sold â but do not tell Uncle I wrote this. Theodore was here on business, he had an idea of taking the ferries, but Uncle gave no hope. As long as he had land in Ditmarsch he would not let the ferries out of his hand, as families had to be considered.\n\nWhether business is going to pieces or not do not know. Theodore says many forwarding agents are looking for nice business â because the Channel business is bad. Wilhelm has acquired a bride and they consider him very handsome.\n\nI am practising Fortepiano a lot amongst other things \"Futuna Gallop\" \"Sleep Walker's Waltz\" and \"Brothers Run\" gallop. This week we have a young people's ball. Karl Weber has a position in Heurburg â an important one Salary 50 (something)\n\nI do not know if I shall go to the ball. I do not know why Uncle wants me to stay at home, Uncle and Aunt are going.\n\nWith love\n\nIwanne.\n\nÂ\n\nBertha sends love."
