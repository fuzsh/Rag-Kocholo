        "text": "The Boyle Family\n\nThe Boyle family were pioneering settlers in the Vermont area. David Boyle was one of the original six residents for which Scotchman's Hill (now Forest Hill) was named.\n\nDavid Boyle\n\n​David Boyle (b.1820-d. 1900) was born in Dumfries, Scotland, and was one of the original six residents for which Scotchman's Hill (now Forest Hill) was named (Sydenham, 1990; Brennan, 1972). He married his sweetheart, Isabella Wilson, on 12th January, 1841, in the Parish of Morton in County Dumfries, Scotland (Pretlove, 2012, p. 35). Later that same year, the couple embarked on a 14-week journey from Scotland to Australia as ‘self-funded immigrants’ aboard the ship ‘England’ which boasted a crew of some 345 immigrants; 119 from England, 21 from Scotland and 205 from Ireland (Pretlove, 2012, p. 36).\n\nDavid and Isabella Boyle. Source: (Pretlove, 2012).\n\nDavid and Isabella Arrive in Melbourne (1841)\n\nShortly after their arrival in Melbourne, David and Isabella welcomed their first child, Walter, who was born on 3rd October, 1841 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 36). The couple soon decided to settle in the town of Corio Bay towards present day Geelong where David found employment as Head Gardener to Anne Drysdale and her business partner, Caroline Newcomb (Pretlove, 2012, p. 36-37). David successfully introduced oranges and lemons at Anne and Caroline’s farms at Boronggoop Station and Coriyule (Pretlove, 2012, p. 45). Whilst living in the Geelong district, David and Isabella had a further three children: Agnes (born 30th July, 1843), John (born 20th March 1845) and Margaret (born 25th November 1846) (Pretlove, 2012, p. 45).\n\nCharterisville Estate (1847-1853)\n\nIn October 1847, David received a new career opportunity in the form of an appoinment in Melbourne as Head Gardener at the Charterisville Estate; the home of banker David Charteris McArthur (Pretlove, 2012, p. 39-41). The property, which comprised several acres located between Heidelberg and Ivanhoe, featured a “long, grey homestead, with grounds sloping down to the river flats” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 45-46). Whilst his services were engaged by McArthur, David continued to develop his innovative talent and skills as a gardener and maintained the English character of the gardens; a prominent feature of which were the blooms of lilac and roses (Pretlove, 2012, p. 46). Servants and gardener’s cottages were also situated on the estate behind the main homestead and provided a dwelling for David and his growing family. It was here, in Heidelberg, that David and Isaella had a further two children: Joseph (born in 1852) and David Junior (born in 1853) (Pretlove, 2012, p. 47). Sadly, the couple's firstborn son, Walter, passed away at the age of ten in 1851 (Pretlove, 2012). In the years that followed, three more children were born to David and Isabella: William James (born 2nd may, 1854), Walter (born June, 1857) and Robert William (born 17th September, 1858) (Pretlove, 2012, p. 47). In 1853, David left his position at the Charterisville Estate to embark on a new endeavour whereupon he started his first nursery at Boroondara with business partner, William Holt (Pretlove, 2012, p. 48).\n\nThe Boyle Family Settles in Nunawading\n\nBy 1888, the Boyle family had decided to settle in Nunawading where David established a new home and nursery on land acquired under license from the Crown under Section 42 of the Amending Land Act of 1865 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 56 & 102). David had pegged out 58 acres (23.47 ha) of land at a cost of 10 shillings ($1) per acre which he agreed to pay over a ten year period at a sum of two shillings (20 cents) per acre. David, together with his sons John, 16, and Joseph, 11, cleared and marked out the plans for the family home. Felled trees cut into lengths were used as the foundation for a wattle and timber construction which was plastered with a “sticky material, usually made of some combination of kneaded clay and small twigs or straw” and finished with thick roof beams to support logs and later, shingles (Pretlove, 2012, p. 58). A timber verandah and chimney were then added to complete the dwelling. Later, the windows were upgraded from small shutters to glass panes (Pretlove, 2012, p. 58). The interior was decorated with rustic furniture pieces handcrafted by David. Isabella and their younger children, including their infant daughter Jessie (born 16th August, 1861), remained in accomodation in Hawthorn whilst the foundation work was completed (Pretlove, 2012, p. 57).\n\nThe Nursery\n\nDavid's nursery at Nunawading soon prospered and became a fixture in the district for more than 30 years; serving as a place for David to share his vast knowledge of propagation of “all manner of plants, sowing of seeds…and fruit culture” with the local community (Pretlove, 2012, p. 49). David also received assistance in the nursery from his son, Walter, who like his father became proficient in handcrafting rustic furniture pieces such as chairs, couches, pot plant stands and tables which were sold from the nursery. A charming selection of fruit trees, seasonal fruit, flower and vegetable seeds, vines and cut flowers were also sold to customers (Pretlove, 2012, p. 49-50).\n\nIn 1865, a daughter, Isabella, was born in Nunawading. By 1871, the Boyles had cleared a further six acres of their land on which 221 varieties of fruit trees were grown; among them pears, apples, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, nectarines, figs, pomegranates as well as grape vines (Pretlove, 2012, p. 58). According to David’s descendent, Chris Pretlove, “a fern house was erected and also a large ti-tree trelliswork for shelter for pot plants” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 58). The family also cultivated a productive vegetable garden with Giant Rhubarb, Sea-Kale, Marjoram, Lavender, Garlic, Parsley, Mint, Sage, Thyme, Lettuce, Asparagus, Tomatoes, Pumpkins, Carrots, Turnips, Swedes, French Beans, Peas, Beetroot, Potatoes, Broccoli, Cabbage (Early Enfield Shepherd’s, Large Early) and Cauliflower (Early Dutch, Large Asiatic) (Pretlov, 2012, p. 58).\n\nDavid's Relationship with Ferdinand von Mueller\n\nDavid Boyle was also a friend, correspondent and occasional field-work assistant, of botanist Baron Ferdinand von Mueller and would make observations and collections of plants on his behalf, with a particular interest in \"specimens of rare and unusual ferns for delivery to the public gardens” which were collected on trips to the Dandenong Ranges (Pretlove, 2012, p. 74). ​ On one expedition where the two botanists, David and von Mueller, had joined forces to travel toward the Dandenong Ranges, von Mueller was recalled to have looked up and “named the surrounding green hills Vermont” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 82).\n\nDuring David's absence, his sons maintained the family's orchard and nursery in Nunawading. On his expeditions, David “would search in the narrowest of awkward places for the unfamiliar ferns and carry them out to the waiting horses” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 81). On one occassion whilst collecting a specimen of Aspidium falcatum, David exclaimed “I found this fern where the sun never shone upon the surface of that localities for at least a thousand years” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 81). In honour of his close friend, Baron von Mueller, David bestowed the name “The Baron” to a giant Eucalyptus regnans tree he discovered growing on “the eastern bank of the Sassafras Gully, about 6 miles (9.6 km) from Cumawarrabool” in the Dandenong Ranges approximately 29 miles from Melbourne (Pretlove, 2012, p. 64). Photographs of the same tree were featured in an exhibition held in 1888 and were later inspected by renowned horticulturalist William Robert Guilfoyle who at the time was Director of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens; a position which he held from 1873 to 1909, and remarked that the “tree eclipsed not only anything he had previously seen, but all he had ever expected in the way of giant vegetation in Australia” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 64). The tree was subsequently included in the album of The Great Trees of Victoria after David Boyle led photographer Duncan Peirce to the specimen (Pretlove, 2012, p. 65).\n\nDavid Boyle's tree; a large specimen of Eucalyptus regnans (Mountain Ash), named 'The Baron' in honour of his friend, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, as photographed by Duncan Peirce in 1899. The tree was located on the eastern side of the Sassafras Gully in the Dandenong Ranges approximately 29 miles from Melbourne. ​Source: National Library of Australia.\n\nDuring his time spent living in Nunawading, David also served as secretary of the Mount Pleasant Committee and thus supported the development of the first school in the Vermont district (Brennan, 1972).\n\nWalter Leonard Boyle\n\nDavid and Isabella’s son, Walter Leonard Boyle (b. 1857-d. 1943), was born in Boroondara, Victoria, in 1857 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 121). As he grew up, Walter became a Nurseryman in the Nunawading area and became the only one of six sons to pursue a career in the nursery business like his father, David, whom he would assist in auctions to sell plants and rustic furniture. Walter’s pioneering spirit led him to take up a stall at the Ringwood Market when it first opened in 1893 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 122). Walter was a skilled horticulturalist in his own right and grew \"an extensive array of flowers and plants to supply the florists in Melbourne” such as Roses, Dahlias, Primrose, Snapdragons, Stocks, Violets, Antirrhinium, Aquilegia, Granny-Bonnets (long-spurred), China asters, Pansies, Ranunculus, Gladiolus, Iceland poppies and water-lillies (Pretlove, 2012, p. 122). ​\n\nWalter Boyle, son of David Boyle.

As documented by David’s descendent, Chris Pretlove, “after the land boom busted and all the banks shut, Walter bought a weatherboard house in Mitcham for 16 pounds ($32) [which] was shifted onto eight acres of Canterbury Road” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 124).\n\nIn 1879, Walter attended the first meeting of the Nunawading Exhibition Committee during which he declared his desire to collect wood and fibres from the local area for the purpose of constructing “rustic seats, tables and other articles” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 125). Walter would “gather crooked pieces of wood, knowing just the trees he required…[with] a design in his head when gathering the pieces for the furniture [and] knew his timber well” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 125). Together, David and Walter received a Fourth Order of Merit at the Centennial International Exhibition of 1888 in recognition of their rustic furniture and associated products (Pretlove, 2012, p. 64 & 125). As he grew up, Walter’s son Clyde also assisted his father in collecting appropriate timber and “had the job of stripping the bark when he came home from school” (Pretlove, 2012, p. 126).\n\nWalter Boyle's rustic couch presented as a gift to his son and daughter-in-law Clyde and Maude Boyle. After they left Vermont in 1940, the couch was stored on the verandah of Clyde and Maude's home in Warnambool. Source: (Pretlove, 2012).\n\nWalter went on to further perfect his rustic creations; selling pieces to Foy and Gibson who at the time, owned a large retail store in North Melbourne (Pretlov, 2012, p. 126). Walter’s creations featured a range of “rustic chairs, tables, pot stands, dining suites, garden settees [and] bridges” some examples of which survive to this day (Pretlove, 2012, p. 126).\n\n“Rustic Garden Seats 18/ each”\n\nFoy and Gibson’s Advert 1902 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 126)\n\n“Rustic Garden Seats, 3 ft. 6 in. long, 17/6; 5 ft., 27/6, Chairs, 7/ each; Arm Chairs, 12/ each”\n\nFoy and Gibson’s Advert 1916 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 126)\n\nBy 1918, Walter’s health sadly began to deteriorate which left him unable to fulfill the demand for large quantities of his rustic “crooked wood furniture” for which the necessary wood was becoming increasingly difficult to acquire as the residual blocks of bushland were cleared in the Nunawading area (Pretlove, 2012, p. 126).\n\nDuring 1905, Walter and his family settled in Vermont after the family’s four-roomed weatherboard house was moved from Mitcham to an eight acre (3.2 ha) property in Vermont with the use of bullocks (Pretlove, 2012, p. 138). Walter eventually sold the house and four acres (1.6 ha) of land to his brother Joseph Boyle and used the proceeds to fund the construction of “a new four-roomed house [at the] cost of 200 pounds ($400)” built on five acres (Pretlove, 2012, p. 138).\n\nClyde's son, Mervyn, pictured in the front yard of the Boyle's Vermont home on his horse, 'Prince'. Source: (Pretlove, 2012).\n\nJoseph Nash Boyle\n\n​Joseph Nash Boyle (b. 1853-d. 1919) was the brother of Walter Leonard Boyle (b. 1857). He married Emma Jane Edwards with whom he had 7 children; Joseph (b. 1881), Joseph Dudley (b. 1883), Oswald John James (b. 1883), Walter Leonard (b. 1883), Sophie Marion (b. 1889), Ralph Gordon (b. 1897) and Ivan Alexander Lancelot (b. 1900). Joseph's son Walter Leonard worked at the Mitcham Tile Works (Pretlove, 2012).\n\nClyde Henry Boyle\n\nClyde Henry Boyle (b. 1899-d. 1985) was born on 13th August 1899 to parents Walter Leonard Boyle and Florence Boyle (Pretlove, 2012). Continuing the family tradition, Clyde's occupation was as a Nurseryman/Florist. In 1920, at the age of 21, Clyde married Maude Charlotte Cornish Shinners who worked for Mrs. Matheson at the nearby Strathdon Orchard (Pretlove, 2012). Clyde and his sibilings, Ruby and Evelyn, would attend their early years of schooling in Vermont; completing the one mile journey to school on foot before the family relocated to Warnambool, Victoria in 1937 (Pretlove, 2012, p. 138).\n\nClyde and Maude Boyle (nee Shinners) pictured in 1920, both aged 21 years old.
