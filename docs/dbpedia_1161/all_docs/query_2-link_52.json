        "text": "Fredericksburg-based RM Productions hosted a press conference and social event last month to commemorate two actors signing on for work in future projects. The two-hour affair recognized Sharon Toliver and Chris Wargo for their roles in previous projects with the production company and their accomplishments in the industry and allowed guests, actors and producers to network.\n\nRM Productions started in 2007, according to owner, director and producer Rico Mickens. Over the years, the company has produced several feature films, with their first released in 2013. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, six of their feature films were screened at EVO Entertainment, previously known as Paragon Theaters.\n\nToliver has been a part of six films with RM Productions, while Wargo has appeared in five. The two actors signed contracts to solidify their compensation for and involvement with future episodes for “Autonomous 2,” a sequel to their 2023 short film, “Autonomous.”\n\nDuring the Q and A session, both actors discussed their journey into the film industry. Toliver said that she had theater and choir experience in high school, but didn’t start acting in official productions until 2018 when she was approached by Mickens. “In my mind, it’s never too late to start,” Toliver said. “A dream delayed in not a dream denied.”\n\nWargo shared that his path took a massive turn, from a career in science engineering, corporate management and business management to acting in productions and commercials. He began doing background work; his first appearance was on Netflix’s “House of Cards,” which was filmed in Washington and Maryland. “I never ever thought I would ever be on camera,” he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWargo explained he sought out acting classes to get more familiar with the craft, and has caught the acting bug ever since.\n\nBoth actors have received a few awards for their work. In 2019, Wargo received Best Supporting Actor in a Short Film in the DMV at the World Music and Independent Film Festival in Maryland. In May of this year, Toliver received the festival’s award for Best Actress in a Short Film in the DMV for her role in “Autonomous,” which was the second win for best actress in her career.\n\nMickens said that recognizing Toliver and Wargo is very important to understanding how hard the actors and the production company have worked together to create their projects. “[I’ve set] different goals and different levels in my company, so they have reached this goal now, but now they’re actually getting paid on these projects,” Mickens said. “I want you guys to know ... it wasn’t about the money for them, it was the passion.”\n\nMickens said that the independent filmmaking industry can be tough, especially financially. He expressed his gratitude to Toliver and Wargo for their commitment to the company and their investment in the craft. “If you invest in yourself, I will invest in you too,” Mickens said. “A lot of people didn’t want to do that. But these guys surprisingly did that.”\n\nAt the end of the Q and A, Wargo and Toliver explained what’s next in their acting career. “I’m going to continue working on fulfilling my dreams and perfecting my acting craft,” Toliver said. “I’m going to keep on working, keep on perfecting and keep on building.”\n\n“I’m always optimistic ... I’ve been trying to move towards and find more access to what I call the holy grail— a day player on ‘Law and Order’ type of thing. We’ll see,” Wargo said with a chuckle.\n\nUpdates on future episodes and projects from RM Productions may be viewed on their Facebook page or YouTube.\n\nViviana Smith: vsmith@freelancestar.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nViviana Smith\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
