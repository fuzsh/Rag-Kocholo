        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAlong with a few other nations that have comparable laws, Louisiana has just passed a law requiring surgical castration for child sex offenders. Debate over the measure has begun, with proponents pointing to punishment and opponents calling for rehabilitation and calling the sentence cruel.\n\nLouisiana has proposed legislation mandating surgical castration for people found guilty of sexual acts against kids. This new law targets victims of child pornography, rape, molestation, and incest. Unlike pharmaceutical castration, which involves removing both testicles or ovaries, surgical castration is a permanent and irreversible procedure. Judges are authorized by law to inflict this sentence on anyone who has sexually molested a child under the age of 13, as per the reports of The U.S. Sun.\n\nLouisiana now joins the Czech Republic, Nigeria, and Madagascar in having this law. These countries are known for their strict criminal laws. Democratic Senator Regina Barrow, who created the law, said she received many distressing reports of child sexual violence, with some cases ending in death. Barrow expressed that some offenders might need to remain incarcerated due to their severe behavior.\n\nLaw details and implications\n\nBarrow thinks that the possibility of losing a body part could discourage those who abuse children. The process would take place no later than seven days following the offender's release from custody. Refusal or nonattendance could result in an extra three to five years behind bars for the offender. This sentence is optional for the court to administer, and it will only be applicable to anyone found guilty on or after August 1, 2024.\n\nAlso Read : How much is Snoop Dogg getting paid at the Olympics as a promotional figure?\n\nFor more than 15 years, chemical castration has been legal in Louisiana. This reversible approach lowers sex drive by using drugs to inhibit the production of testosterone. Additionally, chemical castration is legal in a number of states, including Texas, Florida, and California. After Glenn Sullivan Sr. was found guilty of raping and impregnating a 14-year-old girl, a judge recently ordered that he undergo chemical castration.\n\nControversy and criticism\n\nDebate has arisen since surgical castration was introduced. The government should concentrate on rehabilitating convicts, according to critics. Professor of philosophy Katrina Sifferd claims that society does not physically harm criminals—for example, by raping rapists or chopping off thieves' hands—and that some people see the law as torture.\n\nAlso Read : One Piece Chapter 1123: See release date, time, how to watch and what to expect\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat new law did Louisiana pass for child sex offenders?\n\nLouisiana passed a law requiring surgical castration for child sex offenders, making it one of the few places in the world with such a measure.\n\nWhich crimes does the new Louisiana law target?\n\nThe law targets offenders involved in child pornography, incest, rape, and molestation, allowing judges to order surgical castration for those who sexually assaulted children under 13.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
