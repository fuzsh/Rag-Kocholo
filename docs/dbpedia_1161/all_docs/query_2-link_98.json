        "text": "Clerical and Administrative Support Positions\n\nThis qualification standard covers positions in the General Schedule that involve the performance of one-grade interval clerical and administrative support work. It contains common patterns of creditable experience and education to be used in making qualifications determinations.\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this standard is provided below.\n\nThis standard may also be used for one-grade interval positions other than those listed if the education and experience pattern is determined to be appropriate.\n\nExperience and Education Requirements\n\nThe following table shows the amounts of education and/or experience required to qualify for positions covered by this standard.\n\nGRADE/\n\nPOSITIONSEXPERIENCEEDUCATION GENERALSPECIALIZED GS-1\n\nAll positions None None None GS-2\n\nAll positions 3 months None High school graduation\n\nor equivalent GS-3\n\nClerk-Steno\n\n-----------------\n\nAll other positions 6 months None High school graduation\n\nor equivalent\n\n-----------------\n\n1 year above high school GS-4\n\nAll positions 1 year None 2 years above high school GS-5\n\nClerk-Steno\n\n---------------\n\nAll other positions\n\n2 years\n\n---------------\n\nnone\n\nNone\n\n---------------\n\n1 year equivalent to at least GS-4 4 years above high school\n\n(except Reporting Stenographer) GS-6 and\n\nabove\n\nAll positions None 1 year equivalent to at least next lower grade level Generally, not applicable\n\nSome of the occupational series covered by this standard include both one- and two-grade interval work. The qualification requirements described in this standard apply only to those positions that typically follow a one-grade interval pattern. While the levels of experience shown for most positions covered by this standard follow the grade level progression pattern outlined in the table, users of the standard should refer to E.3.(o) in the \"Policies and Instructions\" section for guidance on crediting experience for positions with different lines of progression.\n\nGeneral Experience (All positions except Reporting Stenographer, Shorthand Reporter, and Closed Micro-phone Reporter)--Progressively responsible clerical, office, or other work that indicates ability to acquire the particular knowledge and skills needed to perform the duties of the position to be filled.\n\nSpecialized Experience (All positions except Reporting Stenographer, Shorthand Reporter, and Closed Micro-phone Reporter)--Experience that equipped the applicant with the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's) to perform successfully the duties of the position, and that is typically in or related to the position to be filled. To be creditable, specialized experience must have been equivalent to at least the next lower grade level. Applicants who have the 1 year of appropriate specialized experience, as indicated in the table, are not required by this standard to have general experience, education above the high school level, or any additional specialized experience to meet the minimum qualification requirements.\n\nExperience for Reporting Stenographer, Shorthand Reporter, and Closed Microphone Reporter-- One year of experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade level using the skills and equipment appropriate to the position to be filled is required for all positions. Following is a description of qualifying experience for these positions.\n\nReporting Stenographer, GS-5: Experience as a clerk-stenographer, secretary, reporting stenographer, or in other positions that included application of stenography and typing skills as a significant part of the work.\n\nReporting Stenographer, Shorthand Reporter, and Closed Microphone Reporter, GS-6:Experience as a reporting stenographer, hearing reporter, or in other positions in which the primary duty was to make and transcribe manual or machine-written shorthand records of hearings, interviews, or similar proceedings.\n\nShorthand Reporter and Closed Microphone Reporter, GS-7 and above: Experience as a court reporter, or hearing reporter, or in other positions in which the primary duty was to make verbatim records of proceedings.\n\nEducation: High school graduation or the equivalent is creditable at the GS-2 level for the occupations listed, except Clerk-Stenographer, where it is creditable at the GS-3 entry level.\n\nSuccessfully completed education above the high school level in any field for which high school graduation or the equivalent is the normal prerequisite is creditable at grades GS-3 through GS-5 for all positions except Reporting Stenographer, GS-5. This education must have been obtained in an accredited business, secretarial or technical school, junior college, college or university. One year of full-time academic study is defined as 30 semester hours, 45 quarter hours, or the equivalent in a college or university, or at least 20 hours of classroom instruction per week for approximately 36 weeks in a business, secretarial, or technical school.\n\nAs a general rule, education is not creditable above GS-5 for most positions covered by this standard; however, graduate education may be credited in those few instances where the graduate education is directly related to the work of the position.\n\nIntensive Short-Term Training-- Completion of an intensive, specialized course of study of less than 1 year may meet in full the experience requirements for GS-3. Courses of this type normally require completion of up to 40 hours per week of instruction rather than the usual 20 hours per week, and are usually of at least 3 months duration. Such courses may have been obtained through a variety of programs such as those offered by business or technical schools, and through military training programs. To be creditable, such a course must have been designed specifically as career preparation for the work of the position being filled, and must have provided the applicant with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to do the work.\n\nCombining Education and Experience: Equivalent combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience may be used to meet total experience requirements at grades GS-5 and below, except for Reporting Stenographer, GS-5.\n\nFor GS-3 and GS-4 level positions, determine the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required for the grade level; then determine the applicant's education as a percentage of the education required for the grade level; then add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for that grade level.\n\nFor GS-5 level positions (except Clerk-Stenographer, which does not require specialized experience), only education in excess of the first 60 semester hours (i.e., beyond the second year) is creditable toward meeting the specialized experience requirement. One full academic year of study (30 semester hours) beyond the second year is equivalent to 6 months of specialized experience.\n\nThe following are examples of how education and experience may be combined. They are examples only, and are not all inclusive:\n\nThe position to be filled is a Payroll Clerk, GS-4. An applicant has 8 months of qualifying experience and 20 semester hours of college. The applicant meets 67 percent of the required experience and 33 percent of the required education. The applicant meets 100 percent of the total requirements and is qualified for the position.\n\nThe position to be filled is a Clerk-Typist, GS-4. The applicant has 4 months of qualifying experience and 1 year of business school. The applicant meets 33 percent of the required experience and 50 percent of the required education. The applicant meets 83 percent of the total requirements and is not qualified for the position.\n\nThe position to be filled is a Clerk-Stenographer, GS-5. An applicant has 1 year of qualifying experience and 90 semester hours of college. The applicant meets 50 percent of the required experience and 75 percent of the required education. The applicant exceeds 100 percent of the total requirements and is qualified for the position.\n\nThe position to be filled is an Editorial Assistant, GS-5. The applicant has 9 months of specialized experience and 75 semester hours of college (15 semester hours beyond the second year and the equivalent of 3 months of specialized experience). The applicant meets 75 percent of the required experience and 25 percent of the required education. The applicant meets 100 percent of the requirement for 1 year of specialized experience and is qualified for the position.\n\nProficiency Requirements\n\nClerk-Typist, Office Automation Clerk/Assistant, Clerk-Stenographer, Data Transcriber, and Positions with Parenthetical Titles of (Typing), (Office Automation), (Stenography), or (Data Transcription)\n\nIn addition to meeting experience or education requirements, applicants for these positions must show possession of the following skills, as appropriate. Applicants may meet these requirements by passing the appropriate performance test, presenting a certificate of proficiency from a school or other organization authorized to issue such certificates by the Office of Personnel Management local office, or by self-certifying their proficiency. Performance test results and certificates of proficiency are acceptable for 3 years. Agencies may verify proficiency skills of self-certified applicants by administering the appropriate performance test.\n\nClerk-Typist, GS-2/4; Office Automation Clerk/ Assistant (any grade); (Typing) (any grade); and (Office Automation) (any grade):\n\n40 words per minute typing speed1\n\nData Transcriber, GS-2/4; and (Data Transcription) (any grade):\n\nskill in operating an alphanumeric data transcribing machine,\n\nor 20 words per minute typing speed1 for GS-2 transcription duties\n\nor 25 words per minute typing speed1 for GS-3 and GS-4 transcription duties\n\nClerk-Stenographer, GS-3/4:\n\n40 words per minute typing speed1 and\n\n80 words per minute dictation speed2\n\nClerk-Stenographer, GS-5:\n\n40 words per minute typing speed1 and\n\n120 words per minute dictation speed2\n\n(Stenography) (any grade):\n\n40 words per minute typing speed1 and either\n\n80 words per minute dictation speed2 for GS-3 and GS-4 stenographic duties\n\nor 120 words per minute dictation speed2 for GS-5 stenographic duties\n\nReporting Stenographer, Shorthand Reporter, and Closed Microphone Reporter\n\nIn addition to meeting the experience requirements, applicants for these positions must show possession of the following skills with equipment appropriate to the specific position.\n\nReporting Stenographer, GS-5/6: 120 words per minute dictation speed3\n\nShorthand Reporter and Closed Microphone Reporter, GS-6: 160 words per minute dictation speed3\n\nShorthand Reporter and Closed Microphone Reporter, GS-7 and above: 175 words per minute dictation speed3\n\nApplicants must also be able to produce accurate typewritten transcripts of recorded proceedings.\n\nApplicants for competitive appointment and inservice applicants for initial assignment to these three positions at all grade levels must demonstrate the specific skill and level of proficiency required by the position to be filled. Also, inservice applicants for promotion to positions that have a higher proficiency requirement than the position previously held must demonstrate the higher level of proficiency. Applicants may demonstrate that proficiency by either passing a dictation test at the required speed or presenting a certificate of proficiency showing speed and accuracy equivalent to those used in the Office of Personnel Management performance tests for these positions. The certificate must show that the candidate demonstrated the required proficiency, i.e., dictation speed and accuracy, to a teacher of stenography, shorthand reporting, or closed microphone reporting, within the past year. Applicants for these positions may not self-certify dictation proficiency.\n\nUsing Selective Factors For Positions Covered by this Standard\n\nSelective factors must represent knowledge, skills, or abilities that are essential for successful job performance and cannot reasonably be acquired on the job during the period of orientation/training customary for the position being filled. It is unlikely, for example, that a requirement for experience with a particular brand of word processing software could be justified as a selective factor for an Office Automation Clerk position. Since knowledge of that software may be desirable, such knowledge could be appropriately used as a quality ranking factor. On the other hand, proficiency in the correct use of medical terminology may be needed immediately to perform the duties of a Medical Records Technician position to provide continuity in an agency's medical records program. If that is the case, knowledge of medical terminology could be used as a selective factor in filling the position.\n\nWords per minute are based on a 5 minute sample with three or fewer errors.\n\nThe maximum number of errors allowed in a dictation sample equals 10 percent of the required dictation speed (80 words per minute or 120 words per minute) multiplied by the number of minutes in the sample.\n\nThe maximum number of errors allowed in a dictation sample for these three positions equals 5 percent of the required dictation speed multiplied by the number of minutes in the sample.\n\nOccupational Coverage\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this qualification standard is provided below. The occupational series marked with an asterisk have individual occupational requirements.\n\nBack to Top\n\nTechnical and Medical Support Positions\n\nThis qualification standard covers positions in the General Schedule that involve the performance of one-grade interval technical or medical support work. It contains common patterns of creditable experience and education to be used in making qualifications determinations.\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this standard is provided below.\n\nThis standard may also be used for one-grade interval positions other than those listed if the education and experience pattern is determined to be appropriate.\n\nExperience and education requirements\n\nThe following table shows the amounts of education and/or experience required to qualify for positions covered by this standard.\n\nGRADEEXPERIENCEEDUCATION GENERALSPECIALIZED\n\nEquivalent combinations of education and experience are qualifying for all grade levels and positions for which both education and experience are acceptable.\n\nWhile the levels of experience shown for most positions covered by this standard follow the grade level progression pattern outlined in the table, users of the standard should refer to E.3.(o) in the \"General Policies and Instructions\" for guidance on crediting experience for positions with different lines of progression.\n\nGeneral Experience: (l) Any type of work that demonstrates the applicant's ability to perform the work of the position, or (2) experience that provided a familiarity with the subject matter or processes of the broad subject area of the occupation.\n\nSpecialized Experience: Experience that equipped the applicant with the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's) to perform successfully the duties of the position, and that is typically in or related to the work of the position to be filled. To be creditable, specialized experience must have been equivalent to at least the next lower grade level. Applicants who have the 1 year of appropriate specialized experience, as indicated in the table, are not required by this standard to have general experience, education above the high school level, or any additional specialized experience to meet the minimum qualification requirements.\n\nEducation: High school graduation or the equivalent is qualifying for GS-2.\n\nSuccessfully completed post-high school education is qualifying for grades GS-3 through GS-5. This education must have been obtained in an accredited business or technical school, junior college, college or university for which high school graduation or the equivalent is the normal prerequisite. One year of full-time undergraduate study is defined as 30 semester hours, 45 quarter hours, or the equivalent in a college or university or at least 20 hours of classroom instruction per week for approximately 36 weeks in a business or technical school.\n\nFor some occupations covered by this standard, 6 semester hours of specific courses are included in the l year of education that meets the GS-3 requirements. The 6 semester hours allow for subjects that are common to a broad range of degree programs, e.g., subjects in the mathematical, physical, or biological sciences. This inclusion corresponds to the second part of the description of general experience, i.e., the subjects provide evidence of a familiarity with the subject matter or processes of the broad subject area of the occupation. At grades GS-4 and above, a portion of the education is usually directly related to the work of the position to be filled. Examples of related courses are provided in the individual occupational requirements where applicable. However, agencies may require other courses if they are considered to be more related to the position to be filled.\n\nTraining: Completion of appropriate training such as inservice training programs, training acquired while serving in the Armed Forces, and government-sponsored developmental training programs will be allowed credit on a month-for-month basis, generally through the GS-5 level. Such training meets general or specialized experience requirements depending upon its applicability.\n\nCompletion of an intensive, specialized course of study of less than l year may meet in full the experience requirements for GS-3. Courses of this type normally require completion of up to 40 hours per week of instruction rather than the usual 20 hours per week, and are usually of at least 3 months duration. Such courses may have been obtained through a variety of programs such as those offered by technical schools and military training programs. To be creditable, such a course must have been designed specifically as career preparation for the work of the position being filled, and must have provided the applicant with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to do the work.\n\nCombining Experience and Education: Equivalent combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience are also qualifying. The combinations described below are those most typical for these positions, i.e., for grades GS-3 through GS-5. If education is used to meet specialized experience requirements, then such education must include courses directly related to the work of the position. (When crediting education, prorate the number of hours of related courses required as a proportion of the total education to be used.)\n\nFor GS-3 level positions, determine the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the 6 months' experience required for GS-3; then deter-mine the applicant's education as a percentage of the l year of education that meets the requirements for GS-3. Add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for GS-3.\n\nFor GS-4 level positions, determine the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the 1 year of experience required for GS-4; then determine the applicant's education as a percentage of the 2 years of education that meets the requirements for GS-4. Add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for GS-4.\n\nFor GS-5 level positions, only education in excess of the first 60 semester hours of a course of study leading to a bachelor's degree is creditable toward meeting the specialized experience requirements. Two full academic years of study, or 60 semester hours, beyond the second year is equivalent to l year of specialized experience. Determine the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the year of specialized experience required at the GS-5 level. Then determine the applicant's education as a percentage of the education that meets the requirements for GS-5. Add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for GS-5.\n\nThe following are examples of how education and experience may be combined. They are examples only, and are not all-inclusive.\n\nThe position to be filled is a Pharmacy Aid, GS-3. An applicant has 2 months of experience and 20 semester hours of college. The applicant meets 33 percent of the required experience and 67 percent of the required education. The applicant meets 100 percent of the total requirements and is qualified for the position.\n\nThe position to be filled is an Industrial Engineering Technician, GS-4. An applicant has 5 months of general experience and 36 semester hours of college. The applicant meets 42 percent of the required experience and 60 percent of the required education. The applicant exceeds 100 percent of the total requirements and is qualified for the position. (This example assumes that education is being used to meet the specialized experience requirements, and that at least 7 of the 36 semester hours are in courses directly related to the work of the position.) Examples of such courses are provided in the individual occupational requirements for the Industrial Engineering Technician Series, GS-895.\n\nThe position to be filled is a Recreation Assistant, GS-5. An applicant has 8 months of GS-4 level specialized experience and 80 semester hours of college. The applicant meets 67 percent of the required experience and 33 percent of the required education (i.e., 20 semester hours in excess of the first 60 semester hours). The applicant meets 100 percent of the total requirements and is qualified for the position. At least 8 of the 20 semester hours must be directly related to the work of the position. Examples of such courses are provided in the individual occupational requirements for the Recreation Aid and Assistant Series, GS-189.\n\nUsing selective factors for positions covered by this standard\n\nSelective factors must represent knowledge, skills, or abilities that are essential for successful job performance and cannot reasonably be acquired on the job during the period of orientation/training customary for the position being filled. For example, a requirement for knowledge of microbiological laboratory techniques may be needed immediately to perform the duties of a Biological Technician position in a disease research laboratory. If that is the case, such knowledge could be justified as a selective factor in filling the position.\n\nUsing individual occupational requirements with this standard\n\nGeneral experience requirements at the GS-2 and GS-3 levels are described in the group coverage standard so that the applicant pool at those \"trainee\" levels will be as generally inclusive as possible. Thus, examples of qualifying general experience are not included in the \"Individual Occupational Requirements\" for positions covered by this qualification standard.\n\nPositions at GS-4 and above require specialized experience, education, or training related to the occupation. Examples of qualifying specialized experience are provided for those occupations where such information is currently available. Examples of qualifying post-high school education or training are also provided.\n\nOccupational Coverage\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this qualification standard is provided below. The occupational series marked with an asterisk have individual occupational requirements.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAdministrative and Management Positions\n\nThis qualification standard covers positions in the General Schedule that involve the performance of two-grade interval administrative and management work. It contains common patterns of creditable experience and education to be used in making qualifications determinations.\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this standard is provided below.\n\nThis standard may also be used for two-grade interval positions other than those listed if the education and experience pattern is determined to be appropriate.\n\nEducation and experience requirements\n\nThe following table shows the amounts of education and/or experience required to qualify for positions covered by this standard.\n\nGRADEEDUCATIONEXPERIENCE GENERALSPECIALIZED GS-5 4-year course of study leading to a bachelor's degree 3 years, 1 year of which was equivalent to at least GS-4 None GS-7 1 full year of graduate level education\n\nor\n\nsuperior academic achievement None 1 year equivalent to at least GS-5 GS-9 master's or equivalent graduate degree\n\nor\n\n2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree\n\nor\n\nLL.B. or J.D., if related None 1 year equivalent to at least GS-7 GS-11 Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree\n\nor\n\n3 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree\n\nor\n\nLL.M., if related None 1 year equivalent to at least GS-9 GS-12\n\nand\n\nabove None None 1 year equivalent to at least next lower grade level\n\nSome of the occupational series covered by this standard include both one- and two-grade interval work. The qualification requirements described in this standard apply only to those positions that typically follow a two-grade interval pattern. While the levels of experience shown for most positions covered by this standard follow the grade level progression pattern outlined in the table, users of the standard should refer to E.3.(p) in the \"Policies and Instructions\" for guidance on crediting experience for positions with different lines of progression.\n\nUndergraduate Education: Successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in any field leading to a bachelor's degree, in an accredited college or university, meets the GS-5 level requirements for many positions covered by this standard. Others have individual occupational requirements that specify that applicants must, in general, (1) have specific course work that meets the requirements for a major in a particular field(s), or (2) have at least 24 semester hours of course work in the field(s) identified. Course work in fields closely related to those specified may be accepted if it clearly provides applicants with the background of knowledge and skills necessary for successful job performance. One year of full-time undergraduate study is defined as 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours.\n\nSuperior Academic Achievement: The superior academic achievement provision is applicable to all occupations covered by this standard. See the \"General Policies and Instructions\" for specific guidance on applying the superior academic achievement provision.\n\nGraduate Education: Education at the graduate level in an accredited college or university in the amounts shown in the table meets the requirements for positions at GS-7 through GS-11. Such education must demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work.\n\nOne year of full-time graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 year of full-time study. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement.\n\nPart-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended.\n\nFor certain positions covered by this standard, the work may be recognized as sufficiently technical or specialized that graduate study alone may not provide the knowledge and skills needed to perform the work. In such cases, agencies may use selective factors to screen out applicants without actual work experience.\n\nGeneral Experience: For positions for which individual occupational requirements do not specify otherwise, general experience is 3 years of progressively responsible experience, 1 year of which was equivalent to at least GS-4, that demonstrates the ability to:\n\nAnalyze problems to identify significant factors, gather pertinent data, and recognize solutions;\n\nPlan and organize work; and\n\nCommunicate effectively orally and in writing.\n\nSuch experience may have been gained in administrative, professional, technical, investigative, or other responsible work. Experience in substantive and relevant secretarial, clerical, or other responsible work may be qualifying as long as it provided evidence of the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's) necessary to perform the duties of the position to be filled. Experience of a general clerical nature (typing, filing, routine procedural processing, maintaining records, or other nonspecialized tasks) is not creditable. Trades or crafts experience appropriate to the position to be filled may be creditable for some positions.\n\nFor some occupations or positions, applicants must have had work experience that demonstrated KSA's in addition to those identified above. Positions with more specific general experience requirements than those described here are shown in the appropriate individual occupational requirements.\n\nSpecialized Experience: Experience that equipped the applicant with the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform successfully the duties of the position, and that is typically in or related to the work of the position to be filled. To be creditable, specialized experience must have been equivalent to at least the next lower grade level in the normal line of progression for the occupation in the organization. Applicants who have the 1 year of appropriate specialized experience, as indicated in the table, are not required by this standard to have general experience, education above the high school level, or any additional specialized experience to meet the minimum qualification requirements.\n\nCombining Education and Experience: Combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience may be used to meet total qualification requirements for the grade levels specified in the table, and may be computed by first determining the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required for the grade level; then determining the applicant's education as a percentage of the education required for the grade level; and then adding the two percentages. The total percentages must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for that grade level. Only graduate education in excess of the amount required for the next lower grade level may be used to qualify applicants for positions at grades GS-9 and GS-11. (When crediting education that requires specific course work, prorate the number of hours of related courses required as a proportion of the total education to be used.)\n\nThe following are examples of how education and experience may be combined. They are examples only, and are not all-inclusive.\n\nThe position to be filled is a Quality Assurance Specialist, GS-1910-5. An applicant has 2 years of general experience and 45 semester hours of college that included 9 semester hours in related course work as described in the individual occupational requirements. The applicant meets 67 percent of the required experience and 38 percent of the required education. Therefore, the applicant exceeds 100 percent of the total requirement and is qualified for the position.\n\nThe position to be filled is a Management Analyst, GS-343-9. An applicant has 6 months of specialized experience equivalent to GS-7 and 1 year of graduate level education. The applicant meets 50 percent of the required experience but none of the required education, since he or she does not have any graduate study beyond that which is required for GS-7. Therefore, the applicant meets only 50 percent of the total requirement and is not qualified for the position. (The applicant's first year of graduate study is not qualifying for GS-9.)\n\nThe position to be filled is a Music Specialist, GS-1051-11. An applicant has 9 months of specialized experience equivalent to GS-9 and 2 1/2 years of creditable graduate level education in music. The applicant meets 75 percent of the required experience and 50 percent of the required education, i.e., the applicant has 1/2 year of graduate study beyond that required for GS-9. Therefore, the applicant exceeds the total requirement and is qualified for the position. (The applicant's first 2 years of graduate study are not qualifying for GS-11.)\n\nUsing selective factors for positions covered by this standard\n\nSelective factors must represent knowledge, skills, or abilities that are essential for successful job performance and cannot reasonably be acquired on the job during the period of orientation/training customary for the position being filled. For example, while the individual occupational requirements for Recreation Specialist provide for applicants to meet minimum qualifications on the basis of education or experience in any one of a number of recreational fields, a requirement for knowledge of therapeutic recreation may be needed to perform the duties of a position providing recreation services to persons with physical disabilities. If that is the case, such knowledge could be justified as a selective factor in filling the position.\n\nOccupational Coverage\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this qualification standard is provided below. The occupational series marked with an asterisk have individual occupational requirements.\n\nBack to Top\n\nProfessional and Scientific Positions\n\nThis qualification standard covers positions in the General Schedule that involve the performance of two-grade interval professional and scientific work. The specific requirements for entry into each occupation covered by this standard are described in individual occupational requirements. Subsection E.4.(g) of the \"Policies and Instructions\" provides guidance on interpreting minimum educational requirements.\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this standard is provided below.\n\nBasic requirements for all grades\n\nApplicants who meet the basic requirements described in the individual occupational requirements are fully qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and above) must also meet the requirements shown in the table on page IV-A-22, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.\n\nThe individual occupational requirements typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic requirements of the occupations covered by this standard:\n\nSuccessful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in paragraph A in the individual occupational requirements.\n\nWhere specific course requirements are not indicated in paragraph A, the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses that may be accepted as part of the program major.\n\nAppropriate combination of education and experience that is typically specified in paragraph B of the individual occupational requirements. The \"paragraph B\" method generally requires that an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in paragraph A above, plus additional education and/or experience. The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the same as described in paragraph A.\n\nThe quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore, creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation.\n\nThe individual occupational requirements for some series make no provision for combining experience and education. Therefore, they do not include paragraph B provisions.\n\nFor a small number of occupations or positions covered by this standard, applicants may possess certain kinds of experience in lieu of education. In such cases, applicants may meet minimum qualification requirements through experience equivalent to a 4-year degree. These situations are generally described in paragraph C of the individual occupational requirements.\n\nApplicants whose experience is used to meet the basic requirements through a paragraph B or C provision may qualify for grades above the entry level if that experience includes 1 year of specialized experience. In such cases, the specialized experience would have to be evaluated to determine if it is at the appropriate grade level in the normal line of progression.\n\nExperience and education requirements for GS-7 and above\n\nIn addition to meeting the basic entry qualification requirements, applicants must have specialized experience and/or directly related education in the amounts shown in the table below.\n\nGRADE/\n\nPOSITIONSEDUCATIONSPECIALIZED\n\nEXPERIENCE GS-7 1 year of graduate-level education or superior academic achievement 1 year equivalent to at least GS-5 GS-9 2 years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a master's degree or master's or equivalent graduate degree 1 year equivalent to at least GS-7 GS-11 3 years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a Ph.D. degree or Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree 1 year equivalent to at least GS-9 GS-12\n\nand\n\nabove 1 year equivalent to at least next lower grade level\n\nResearch Positions\n\nGS-11\n\nresearch positions Master's or equivalent graduate degree 1 year equivalent to at least GS-9 GS-12\n\nresearch positions Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree 1 year equivalent to at least GS-11 GS-13 and above\n\nresearch positions 1 year equivalent to at least next lower grade level\n\nWhile the levels of experience shown for most positions covered by this standard follow the grade level progression pattern outlined in the table, users of the standard should refer to E.3.(p) in the \"Policies and Instructions\" for guidance on crediting experience for positions with different lines of progression.\n\nCombining Education and Experience: When combining education with experience, first determine the applicant's total qualifying education as a percentage of the education required for the grade level; then determine the applicant's experience as a percentage of the experience required for the grade level; finally, add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for that grade level. For example, an applicant for a GS-184, Sociology, position has successfully completed 60 undergraduate semester hours, including 24 semester hours in sociology, and, in addition, has 2 full-time years of appropriate experience that demonstrates that the applicant possesses the necessary analytical and communication skills. The applicant would qualify for GS-5, since the 60 semester hours (the equivalent of 2 years of undergraduate education, or 50 percent of the total requirement) were supplemented by 2 additional years of appropriate experience that provided the remaining 50 percent of the total required education and experience.\n\nSpecialized Experience: Experience that equipped the applicant with the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform successfully the duties of the position, and that is typically in or related to the work of the position to be filled. To be creditable, specialized experience must have been equivalent to at least the next lower grade level in the normal line of progression for the occupation in the organization.\n\nSuperior Academic Achievement: The superior academic achievement provision is applicable to all occupations covered by this standard. See the \"General Policies and Instructions\" for specific guidance on applying the superior academic achievement provision.\n\nGraduate Education: Completion of graduate level education in the amounts shown in the table, in addition to meeting the basic requirements, is qualifying for positions at grades GS-7 through GS-11, and GS-12 research positions if it provided the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work. One year of full-time graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 year of full-time study. If that number cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours should be considered an academic year of graduate study. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended.\n\nResearch Positions: Positions that primarily involve scientific inquiry or investigation, or research-type exploratory development of a creative or advanced scientific nature, where the knowledge required to perform the work successfully is typically and primarily acquired through graduate study (master's or equivalent degree for GS-11, Ph.D. or equivalent for GS-12). The work is such that the academic preparation will equip the applicant to perform the full range of professional work of the position after a short orientation period.\n\nQualification on the basis of education--Applicants for such research positions can be considered qualified for GS-11 if they possess an appropriate master's or equivalent graduate degree, and qualified for GS-12 if they possess a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree.\n\nQualification on the basis of experience--Applicants who furnish positive evidence that they have performed highly creative or outstanding research that has led or can lead to major advances in a specific area of research, to a major advance in the discipline or field of science involved, or to major advances in science in general, can be rated under this provision for highly demanding research positions requiring similar abilities. Under these circumstances, applicants can be rated eligible for the next higher grade level above that for which they would normally be rated, provided they have not been rated eligible at this higher grade on the basis of meeting the graduate study requirements described in paragraph 1 above. To receive this rating, the work must have been creative in the sense that it developed a basic principle, product, concept, method, approach, or technique, or provided a body of basic information that opened the way for a major advance in the discipline or field of science involved, or to advances in science in general, by providing a method of solving other problems, opening areas of research, or providing the means of exploiting the application of science in a major area.\n\nApplicants cannot receive an \"extra\" grade for education, and an additional \"extra\" grade for appropriate experience.\n\nCombination of Graduate Education and Professional Experience: Combinations of successfully completed graduate level education and specialized experience may be used to meet total experience requirements. Only graduate level education in excess of the amount required for the next lower grade level may be combined with experience. For example, an applicant with 6 months of appropriate experience equivalent to GS-7 (50 percent of the experience requirement for GS-9) and 27 semester hours of appropriate graduate education (50 percent of the education requirement for GS-9, in excess of that required for GS-7) would be qualified for a GS-9 position (assuming that there is no evidence that the attended college or university requires more than 18 semester hours as equivalent to a year of graduate study).\n\nUsing selective factors for positions covered by this standard\n\nThere are a variety of situations where agencies would be warranted in limiting consideration to applicants who possess the particular qualifications required to perform the work of positions covered by this standard. For example, an agency may require specific kinds of training appropriate for filling positions concerned with scientific research and development activities, or may require specific educational courses or combinations of courses (where the individual occupational requirements permit applicants to qualify based on several combinations of educational course work) to meet other specialized agency requirements. An agency filling an international economist position may require knowledge of international economics. In this case, since applicants can qualify on the basis of education, the agency may require certain types of educational courses. Similarly, in some cases, consideration may be limited only to those applicants who possess an appropriate license, registration, or certification, if possession of such is determined to be necessary for carrying out the responsibilities of a position and/or required by statute.\n\nOccupational Coverage\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this qualification standard is provided below. All occupational series covered by this standard have individual occupational requirements.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCompetitive Service Student Trainee Positions\n\nThis standard describes the qualification requirements for student trainee positions made under career-conditional or career appointments in the competitive service. This standard is not applicable to students who are temporarily employed during summer vacations and who have not been appointed to a student trainee program in the competitive service as described above.\n\nA student may be appointed to any position that leads to qualification in a two-grade interval professional, administrative, or technical occupational series and that provides an opportunity for the student's growth and development toward the target position.\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this standard is provided below and on page IV-A-25.\n\nRequirements for initial appointment\n\nStudent trainees qualify as described below.\n\nGRADELEVEL OF EDUCATION GS-2 High school diploma or equivalent GS-3 Completion of 1 academic year of post-high school study GS-4 Completion of 2 academic years of post-high school study or associate's degree\n\nThe required education must lead to a bachelor's degree with specialization in or directly related to the field in which the student trainees will receive training on the job. The degree of specialization in this field must satisfy on graduation the specific educational requirements in the qualification standard for the corresponding two-grade interval positions.\n\nPromotion Requirements\n\nStudent trainees may be promoted to higher-graded trainee positions based on completion of portions of the education and student trainee work experience.\n\nTo GS-3: Completion of one full semester or the equivalent of post-high school study and one period of student trainee work experience.\n\nTo GS-4: (a) Completion of 1 academic year of study and two periods of student trainee work experience; or (b) completion of 1½ academic years of study and one period of student trainee work experience.\n\nUpon completion of all the requirements for a bachelor's degree in an appropriate field, student trainees may be reassigned or promoted in the appropriate target series to GS-5 or GS-7 if they meet the qualification requirements of the target occupation, including minimum educational requirements, if any.\n\nExplanation of terms\n\nAn academic year of undergraduate education is defined as 30 semester hours, 45 quarter hours, or the equivalent in an accredited college or university.\n\nFor purposes of this standard, a period of student trainee work experience is the equivalent of 2 months (320 hours) of full-time work experience.\n\nTest Requirements\n\nA written test is not required for these positions.\n\nOccupational Coverage\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this qualification standard is provided below.\n\nBack to Top\n\nPathways Internship Positions\n\nThis standard describes the qualification requirements for Schedule D, Internship appointments under the Pathways Programs authorized by Executive Order 13562 and applies to the white collar occupations listed below under the section, \"Occupational Coverage.\" For student trainee appointments in the competitive service, refer to the Student Trainee Qualification Standard for Competitive Service Positions.\n\nAgencies may:\n\nestablish agency-specific qualification requirements,\n\nuse this OPM qualification standard, or\n\nuse the OPM qualification requirements for the competitive service.\n\nRequirements for Internship Appointments\n\nAppointments may be at the highest grade level for which the Intern is qualified. Interns with no previous related education or experience may qualify as described below.\n\nGRADELEVEL OF EDUCATION GS-1 Enrollment in a high school diploma or General Education Diploma (GED) program. GS-2 Completion of high school or GED diploma. GS-3 Completion of I full academic year of post-high school study. GS-4 Completion of 2 full academic years of post-high school study or an associate's degree. GS-5 Completion of 4 academic years of post-high school leading to a bachelor's degree or equivalent degree.

GS-11 For research positions, completion of all requirements for a master's or equivalent graduate degree. For non-research positions, completion of all requirements for a PhD or equivalent degree.\n\nOne full academic year of undergraduate; graduate; vocational; trades; technical or high school education is the number of credit hours determined by the college, university or school to represent 1 year of full-time study. The high school curriculum must be approved by a State or local governing body. All education beyond high school must be accredited by an accrediting body or organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nSpecial Provisions/or Interns with Previous Related Education or Experience. Previous education and/or experience may be evaluated to determine the highest grade level for which the individual is qualified.\n\nAssessment Requirements\n\nAgencies are required to assess/evaluate the qualifications of applicants for positions covered under Schedule D.\n\nAgencies may use selective factors to identify special requirements needed to perform the work of individual positions.\n\nAgencies may waive OPM test requirements for both initial appointment and non-competitive conversion to the competitive service\n\nPromotion Requirements\n\nThe advancement of Interns to higher-graded positions, prior to conversion, is strictly at the agency's discretion. To qualify for promotions, the Interns must have the same level and type of experience and/or education usually required for an initial appointment.\n\nConversion\n\nInterns may be non-competitively converted to a term, career-conditional or career appointment within 120 days following successful completion of all of their educational and work experience requirements in accordance with 5 CFR 362.204.\n\nOccupational Coverage\n\nA list of the occupational series covered by this qualification standard is provided below.\n\n0099 General Intern (covers occupations in the 0006 through 0095 series)\n\n0199 Social Science, Psychology, and Welfare Intern\n\n0299 Human Resources Intern\n\n0399 General Administrative and Office Services Intern\n\n0499 Natural Resources Management and Biological Sciences Intern\n\n0599 Accounting and Budget Intern\n\n0699 Medical, Hospital, Dental and Public Health Intern\n\n0799 Veterinary Medical Science Intern\n\n0899 Engineering and Architecture Intern\n\n0999 Legal and Kindred Intern\n\n1099 Information and Arts Intern\n\n1199 Business and Industry Intern\n\n1299 Copyright, Patent, and Trade-Mark Intern\n\n1399 Physical Sciences Intern\n\n1499 Library and Archives Intern\n\n1599 Mathematics and Statistics Intern\n\n1699 Equipment, Facilities, and Service Intern\n\n1799 Education Intern\n\n1899 Inspection, Investigation, Enforcement, and Compliance Intern\n\n1999 Quality Assurance, Inspection, and Grading Intern\n\n2099 Supply Intern\n\n2199 Transportation Intern\n\n2299 Information Technology Intern"
