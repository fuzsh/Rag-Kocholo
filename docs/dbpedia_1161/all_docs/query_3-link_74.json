Table\n\nFigure 49: While the body of the beads can be composed in a variety of colours they all display similar randomly placed and sized inserts in a range of colours as seen on this specimen (cat. no. Gui S8xii. 1)\n\nFigure 50: The jagged perforation edge at the lower end may indicate that the beads may originally have had more than two segments (cat. no. Bru. CS.2)\n\nFigure 51: (cat. no. Bru.
