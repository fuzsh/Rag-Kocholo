He said that \"the pact with Italy would have given Italy even more privileges than Germany, which has recognized us de jure, while Italy even refused to consider the Soviet representatives in Rome, the only legal Russian representatives there.\" Russia's position was still further set forth by Radek in an issue of \"Pravda,\" a paper published in Moscow. According to the New York \"Times\" correspondent at that centre, \"the article may be summed up for definite statements as follows: \"(1) Russia can't and won't yield on the point of the principle of private ownership; (2) it is sheer suicide for Russia to restore outright the metallurgical, coal and oil industries which formerly were in the hands of foreigners to their previous owners; (3) regarding the national debts, Russia is in the position of a bankrupt anxious to make a deal with her creditors on the basis of mutual advantage; (4) Russia is going to The Hague to talk business with business men, not politics with politicians.\" In dispatches from The Hague Monday morning it was stated that \"President van Karnebeek, of the In its preliminary sessions the conference at The Conference on Russian Problems, has decided to form Hague appears to have decided upon a sensible gen- the three sub-commissions with only eleven members eral course of procedure.

Property and labor must be protected, even if men who have known war have to be called for the work. Damage suits against the unions may lie, under recent decisions, but exemplary prison terms should enforce individual responsibility. Meanwhile, mild deprecation of violence from Mr. Gompers, and the attempts of the Federation to set up what it calls a Council of Defense against the courts appear incongruous. Organized labor will find itself very seriously on its defense before the American people if it does not shift its attitude and change its methods. In making this statement, we are speaking temperately, but we hope not the less effectively. If the people of this country tolerate such heinous and desperately wicked acts as have disgraced the present week—if the offenders are not ferreted out and prosecuted and punished to the utmost limit of the law; without fear or favor—the blame will be as much upon them as upon those guilty of the ineffable acts. Let the community stir itself from one end of the country to the other and see to it that none of the guilty wretches escape their just deserts. If civilization is not to perish, the public must arouse itself to the enormity of such offenses. JUNIO 241922.] THE CHRONICLE instructions from its Government to take part in the negotiations with the Russians under the reservation that the French would quit the Conference any time • they thought the attitude of the Russians justified that action.\" The further assertion was made that \"the French Government has no expectation that the Conference will lead to any satisfactory or worthwhile agreements with the Russians, but for reasons of a general political nature cannot afford to have a big European meeting held without being present.\" 2755 Premier Poincare of France spent the week-end in London. On Monday he was the guest of honor at a. luncheon given by Premier Lloyd George at the latter's official residence, 10 Downing Street. Most of the members of the British Cabinet were present. Seemingly a great effort was made to convey the impression that the French Premier's visit was not political in character. Special emphasis was placed on the idea that he came to attend \"the British celebration commemorating the defense of Verdun.\" Following the luncheon it was stated that \"the two PreAnnouncement was made on Wednesday of the miers withdrew to the Cabinet room for a friendly heads of the Central Commission of the Conference exchange of views.\" There were present also the on Russian Affairs and of the three sub-commissions. \"Earl of Balfour, the French Ambassador and exThe designations were as follows: \"M.

Seot•nd— 2756 THE CHRONICLE That technical questions shall be adopted ad referendum. Third—That all nations represented at the Conference shall maintain individual positions, the same as at Genoa.\" In a cablegram Wednesday morning the London correspondent of the \"Tribune\" said that Premier Poincare intimated that Lloyd George and he could not \"agree on the Turk-Greek controversy.\" He explained the relative positions of the two nations as follows: \"France is anxious to end hostilities in Anatolia immediately, but Great Britain apparently looks at the subject from a different angle. For a thousand years England has favored independence for the small nations composing the Turkish Empire, while France has favored letting the Turk be master of them all. The British policy is based on sentimentality and a desire to aid any Christians suffering under the Turkish yoke, whereas the French point of view is that the Turks are a more friendly and desirable people than the Christian minorities comprising their empire. This opinion is held also by most persons who have lived any length of time in the Orient.\" He added that \"it is difficult for France and England to reconcile these fundamental differences of opinion, but European harmony requires a cessation of belligerency in the Near East. The fact that it is far removed from European capitals makes it unlikely that that question will prevent continued amicable relations between Paris and London.\" The French Premier returned to Paris on Wednesday \"pleased with his visit to London and gratified by his conversation with Lloyd George, but what satisfaction the French Premier feels is a result of the resumption of not unfriendly relations rather than any accord on large questions. The two chiefs of Government discussed without coming to any agreement of principle the subjects of reparations, and the Orient, particularly Turkey and Tangier.\" These statements were made by the Paris correspondent of the Philadelphia \"Public Ledger.\" The London representative of \"The Sun\" of this city commented on the interview between the two Premiers in part as follows: \"Premier Poincare was smiling when he emerged from Downing Street yesterday. Those who know him intimately know that this external manifestation of feeling on the part of the French Premier is so rare that the fact is given real importance by all who accompanied him to London. The reaction here to the conversation of the two Premiers is one of intense relief. Admittedly Lloyd George and Poincare, after a rapid review of the questions that are pending, did little more than agree to disagree, but at least they learned the exact degree of divergence between each other's views. They also came to an understanding for an early Allied conference, when serious efforts will be made to reach a definite agreement on the policy to be followed in regard to the outstanding problems.\" The official counting of the ballots for a Free State Parliament for South Ireland began at 9 o'clock Monday morning. The Associated Press correspondent in Dublin said that the newspapers of that city \"treat the election results thus far recorded as conclusive evidence that the voters support the AngloIrish treaty.\" As the counting progressed this fact became increasingly evident. As early as 10 o'clock Tuesday night the figures showed \"a majority of 47 for the treaty and Constitution in the new Dail Eireann, which meets July 1.\" At that time the line-up [Vol,. 114. of the parties was as follows: Pro-treaty Coalition, 50; Anti-treaty Coalition, 31; Labor, 14, and Independents 14.\" The New York \"Times\" correspondent in Dublin said that \"the Laborites and Independents are all supporters of the treaty.\" He added that \"the total membership of the Dail is 128, leaving 21 seats still to be decided.\" Outlining still further the results as to individual candidates, the correspondent said: \"Three of the six women in the last Dail have already been defeated. Miss Mary MacSwiney of Cork and Mrs. O'Callaghan of Limerick survive, but Countess Markievicz, Dr. Ada English and Mrs. Clarke have been beaten in South Dublin City, the National University and Mid-Dublin, respectively. Dublin City as a whole had five antitreaty members, now it has one, John T. O'Kelly, former Dail representative in Paris.\" Commenting upon the significance of the results in a broad way, he said: \"The landslide has engulfed the de Valera party in town and country. Even O'Kelly was the last in his division. Absorbing interest is taken in the results, thousands remaining at the polling stations until a late hour to-night. The success of treaty, labor and independent candidates has been stupendous, but the victory was not so much for the classes of the successful candidates as for the country as a whole, being an absolute incontrovertible indication of the national approval of the peace treaty.\" As to the position of de Valera, the correspondent asserted that \"Eamon de Valera remains in the background while his supporters gradually grow fewer. His expected statement on the Constitution draft may not be Imade before the Dail reassembles. He may be disposed to regard the election decision as significant enough and may spring a surprise by accepting it, throwing his strength into the constructive work of the new regime.\" On the other hand, he declared that \"the Collins party is enormously reinforced. The Dail Ministry is intact so far, no member being unseated, though Labor Minister McGrath was run close by an independent labor candidate.\" According to this observer,\"Labor's progress in the country proceeds. Count O'Byrne, anti-treaty, of Tipperary, was unseated by Morrissey, independent labor. Labor also topped the poll in Wexford.\" The complete results of the election promised to be greatly delayed by the discovery on Wednesday that the votes in North, West and South Cork had been tampered with. It was said that the elections would be invalidated. The following details of the affair were given: \"It was the papers of Michael Collins which were the subject of depredation. They had 'been overnight in four sealed boxes. A scrutiny of the third box showed that one hundred of the papers had been tampered with by the altering of the figure one to nine and four marks, thus changing the voters' choice, and otherwise destroyed.\" Eamon de Valera, defeated at the polls, issued a manifesto \"calling upon the Dail Eireann to refuse to ratify the Irish Constitution.\" He declared that the people of South Ireland supported Constitutional candidates only because they feared \"renewal of an infamous war.\" Quite a different spirit was shown by his opponents, Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith. The Dublin correspondent of the New York \"Herald\" said yesterday morning that they interpret the overwhelming pro-treaty vote in the recent election as a mandate to continue the fulfillment of the treaty and JUNE 24 1922.] THE CHRONICLE to establish law and order throughout the country.\" Both leaders were expected to be in Dublin yesterday,\"when a formulation of a program for the new Parliament will begin.\" The following are the latest returns on the election for a Free State Parliament as given in European cable advices: Pro-treaty Coalition, 55; Anti-treaty Coalition, 33; Labor, 15; Independents,6; Trinity College, 4; Farmers,6. The whole Irish situation was further complicated by the assassination of Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson in front of his home in Eaton Place, London, on Thursday. The natural assumption was that it was the work of Sinn Feiners. In the House of Commons yesterday the opponents of the Lloyd George Ministry launched a vigorous attack against it because of the lamentable assassination. Fearing that a vote would be called, the Premier's friends succeeded in securing postponement of debate on the question until Monday. Austen Chamberlain, Government leader, \"stated that every step possible was being taken for the protection of life in Ireland and England. Prime Minister Lloyd George, he asserted, was now holding a conference on all the matters connected with the assassination of Marshal Wilson.\" • As might have been expected, the personnel of the triumvirate appointed to direct the affairs of the Soviet Government in Russia during the illness of Nikolai Lenin, did not meet with the approval of former associates of the Premier. This was said to have been notably true in the case of Leon Trotzky, Minister of War. The New York \"Tribune\" correspondent at Berlin said that lie had heard also that Trotzky was \"angry because the Bolshevik Party refused to name him successor to Lenin.\" The correspondent also cabled that Trotzky \"is expected to use the Red Army in an effort to bolster up his declining influence.\" Under date of June 16, Felix Klemperer, the noted German physician, and others called to attend Nikolai Lenin, were said to have issued the following bulletin regarding his condition: \"The sytmptoms affecting the stomach and bowel tract which continued for ten days have for the present moment disappeared. All the inner organs are in complete order. Temperature and pulse are normal. The symptoms have smoothed down. The patient has left his bed and feels well, but is impatient over the orders of the doctors, who have prescribed inactivity.\" In a cablegram yesterday morning, the Moscow correspondent of the New York \"Times\" said \"Lenin is now reported to be out of danger.\" He added that \"his condition is described as one of slow improvement, but he is not expected to be able to resume work for several months.\" According to his information \"from an authoritative source, the basic trouble is weakness of the digestive and assimilative processes, with an accompanying nervous breakdown, such as sometimes afflicts men past 50 years of age as a result of strenuous business life without proper exercise and attention to diet.\" In another dispatch from Moscow it was reported that \"the Russian Council of Commissars has granted Premier Lenin a leave of absence until autumn on account of his illness. Official discount rates at leading European centres have not been changed from 5% in Berlin, Belgium, France, Denmark and Sweden; 5% in Norway andiMadrid (there having recently been a reduction 2757 from6 to 53/2% atjthe latter point); 6% in Rome; 432% in Holland, and 33/2% in London and Switzerland. In London the open market discount rate on long and short bills was a shade firmer, being quoted at 214%, as against 23@2%% last week. Call money in London also moved up, to 2%,in comparison with 13 4% the previous quotation. In Paris the open market discount rate remains at 43/ 8%,and in Switzerland 13/8%, unchanged. A small loss in gold (£855) was shown by the Bank of England in its return for the week ending June 22, although on the other hand, total reserve, as a result of a further decline of £585,000 in note circulation, increased £584,000. In addition to this, the proportion of reserve to liabilities rose to 19.97%, thus surpassing the previous high record for the year of 19.96%, established in the week of June 8 and comparing with 13.91% for the same week of 1921 and 15.40% the year preceding. The highest ratio in 1921 was 18.61% and the low 8.33. The lowest touched in the current year was 11.04% on Jan. 5. \"Other\" deposits expanded £3,016,000, but public deposits declined £932,000. Loans on Government securities were reduced £1,670,000, while loans on other securities increased £3,196,000. The Bank's stock of gold on hand now stands at £128,883,226, which compares with £128,357,445 last year and £117,815,415 in 1920. Total reserye aggregates £25,961,000, as against £19,329,150 and £21,025,305 one and two years ago, respectively. Note circulation is down to £121,372,000, and this compares with £127,477,995 a year ago and £115,240,110 in 1920, while loans aggregate £76,801,000, in comparison with £78,905,209 last year and £80,139,557 a year earlier. No change has been made in the official discount rate from 3 which went into effect a week ago. Clearings through the Londqn banks for the week amounted to £723,703,000.

The Bank's gold holdings, therefore, now aggregate 5,528,548,950 francs, comparing with 5,520,044,183 francs in 1921 and 5,587,869,840 francs in 1920; of these amounts 1,948,367,056 francs were held abroad in both1922 and 1921 francs in _1920. During the week silver gained 512,000 francs, while general deposits were augmenied by 1i,101,000 francs. Bills discounted, on the other hand, fell off 151,987,000 francs, advances decreased 25,323,000 francs, and Treasury deposits were reduced 22,140,000 francs. A further contrr.:. tion of 176,051,000 francs occurred in note circulation, bringing the amount outstanding down to 35,852,312,000 francs. This contrasts with 37,494,061,955 francs on the corresponding date last year and, with 37,543,904,815 the year previcus:In 1914, just prior to the outbreak of war, the amouict and 1,978,278,416 THE CHRONICLE 2758 was only 6,683,184,785 francs.

Among the sensational changes noted were an expansion in deposits amounting to 8,820,555,000 marks, while discount and Treasury bills gained 7,861,926,000 marks. Treasury loan and association notes registered a gain of 3,181,726,000 marks. An almost equally heavy loss was shown in \"other assets,\" which fell 2,388,488,000 marks. Note circulation was again increased, but not so strikingly as on several recent occasions, the amount of the increase being 430,389,000 marks. Other changes of lesser note included increases of 240;000 marks in total coin and bullion and 999,000 marks in gold. • Bills of exchange increased 435,384,000 marks and advances 9,481,000 marks. \"Other liabilities\" were reduced 135,662,000 marks. Gold holdings are reported as 1,003,861,000 marks, which compares with 1,091,566,000 marks last year and 1,091,700,000 marks in 1920. Note circulation established still another new high record, namely 155,345,277,000 marks, as against 71,883,613,000 marks in the corresponding week of 1921 and 50,-. 808,660,000 inarks a year earlier. Higher reserve ratios, an addition to gold reserves and a scaling down of discounting operations were the features of the Federal Reserve Bank statement, issued late on Thursday afternoon. The report of the combined system indicated a gain in gold of $12,000,000 and an increase in total bills on hand of about $5,000,000. In the New York bank there was an addition to gold holdings of $19,000,000, while 'bill holdings were reduced $12,000,000, the aggregate declining from $69,175,000 to $57,111,000. As to total earning assets, these fell off both locally and nationally, $44,000,000 in the case of the former, and $69,000,000 in the latter. Deposits were also sharply reduced, while the amount of Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation showed only a moderate increase, so that it was not difficult to account for the material gains in reserve ratios. For the twelve reporting banks, the ratio of reserve increased from 77.4 to 79.1%, but at the localS institution the increase was far more pronounced, namely 3.5% to 87.9%. [vol.. 114. 946,000 in Government deposits—a reduction in the latter item of $21,356,000. In net time deposits, however,there was a decline of $39,707,000. Cash in own vaults of members of the Federal Reserve Bank was reduced $3,276,000 to $58,584,000 (not counted as reserve), while the reserves of State banks and trust companies suffered slight decreases—$48,000 in own vaults and $124,000 in other depositories. Surplus was substantially expanded, largely in consequence of the increase in member bank reserves at the Reserve Bank, which, of course, served to offset the addition to deposits, and a gain of $32,422,460 was reported, thus bringing the total of excess reserves up to $63,931,060, the largest amount in quite some time. The above figures for surplus are based on reserves above legal requirements of 13% for member banks of the Federal Reserve System, but not including cash in vault to the amount of $58,584,000 held by these banks on Saturday last. The Clearing House bank statements in more complete form will be found in a subsequent part of this issue. Money at this centre until yesterday was still easier than it had been in recent weeks. With a renewal rate on call loans of 24% and money freely offered at that figure and at 3% there could be no, queition about the money position here, and at other important financial centres in this country for that matter. There have been some upturns in call money quotations, but special significance was not attached to them. For instance, after renewing and 1% on Wednesday a quotation of 3% loaning at 24 was reported in the afternoon. The next day the renewal and loaning rate were the same until the early afternoon, when there was an advance first to 3% and then to 332%. The rapid advance yesterday afternoon from 3 to.5% was said to have been the result of heavy calling of loans. The reduction in the discount rate of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 43/ . to 4% was regarded as far more significant and important than the advances in call money from day to day. The reduction was the result of a careful consideration of the position of the New York banks and also of the country's general money position. The changes in the call money rates probably were due to local and technical conditions that are likely to be of brief duration. Local bankers were disposed to agree with Secretary of the Treasury Mellon that the action by the New York institution was likely to be the forerunner of reductions by Reserve banks in the Far West where the rate has in some instances been above the 432% level that prevailed here until the change of this week. Announcement was made yesterday of a reduction in the rate of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank from 432 to 4%. The Government withdrew $21,000,000 from local institutions this week. Outside of the wild speculation in Mexican Petroleum shares and the heavy trading in Studebaker stock the character of the trading in stocks is not believed to have been of a character to require large loans. Financial institutions still talk favorably about the future of the investment market. Both domestic and foreign issues continue to be offered on a large scale, and with good results, according to all reports. The New York Clearing House bank statement, issued last Saturday, presented some unusualfeatures, chief of which was an expansion in demand deposits of $123,183,000. Loans again increased, namely $25,693,000, while member banks enlarged their Referring to money rates in detail, call loans this reserve at the Reserve Bank $47,379,000. As a result,of the gain in net demand deposits, the total week ranged at 2%@5%,as compared with 2%@4% is now $4,373,545,000, which is exclusive of $57,- last week.

JUNE 241922.] THE CHRONICLE 2'763 he said, living at hone among homogeneous people, cannot easily understand the temporary political influence of foreign and slowly assimilated people here, sometimes believed to hold or perhaps holding the balance of power between our parties in close elections; yet we are making progress, we are realizing our partnership with the nations of the world, and we are learning not only that united action of the two countries makes for universal peace, but that it is almost necessary. Fundamental public opinion here is the real governing factor, and he is sure that this will always prevail in any real exigency. To the Associated Press he said that his chief business during his few weeks' stay is to make a comprehensive study of the English judicial system, whereby he may learn something of value. He is particularly interested in • observing the English way of expediting cases in the courts of the first instance; the English courts have abolished all distinction between law and equity and have only one form of procedure, a step which he would like to see taken here. This is, of course, for lawyers rather than layme4 to consider, yet we can rejoice over every calm and deliberate expression which tends to deepen international friendships and remove the hatreds and jealousies that form the soil in which wars are bred. Secretary Hughes was equally happy and timely in declaring that a sound public opinion is essential to the peaceful and diplomatic aims of the nation. This opinion \"must frown upon the constant efforts to create suspicion, distrust and hatred, for there can be no assurance of peace and few of the just and necessary settlements which make for peace, in a world of hate.\" Absolutely true, and well said is this. It is also true that the chief enemies of peace \"are those who constantly indulge in abuse of foreign peoples and their Governments.\" Intercommunication has become so rapid that domestic discussions fly over the three-mile limit and are too readily caught up as if individual utterances were certainly expressive of basic public opinion; so the principal difficulty now upon foreign affairs comes from \"the untruthful; prejudiced and inflammatory discussions\" in which some persons and even some of our newspapers permit themselves to indulge. If diplomacy is to be more open, there must be a keener sense of responsibility as to international questions, for \"open diplomacy and blatant and injudicious utterances will not go well together.\" All true and timely, and then Mr. Hughes urged the indispensableness of having the people correctly informed as necessary to reaching a wise judgment. The initiative of the Executive in framing a foreign policy, he said, has been abundantly confirmed by practice, but the separateness of the Executive, unINTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP — SENSIBLE der our system, \"has deprived the Executive of opADVICE FROM SECRETARY HUGHES portunities open to parliamentary leaders.\" The • AND CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT.

Mr. Taft cited the long friendship between that Cabinet officers be given opportunity to be his own and the mother country, and, as a citizen heard in person, offering this, however, as a private without any official mandate, he begged his British and non-official opinion. To give to these officers a vote would require a bearers not to be misled by heated ebullitions of temper from one or another faction. A British subject, Constitutional amendment, and Mr. Hughes would No details have yet been given out, but it has been announced that the President will reach a decision in the near future—perhaps within a few days—and make positive recommendations to Congress. The plan will then be considered by the Joint Committee and later,by Congress. The proposed Reorganization Act must be considered as supplementary to the Budget Act. It is not possible to prepare a business-like Federal budget on the basis of the existing organization. The two are really parts of a single reform. In several of our State Governments reorganization preceded the inauguration of the budget system. In order to do a thorough job of house-cleaning it will be necessary for the Government to go one step further. There are thousands of administrative regulations, authorizations, prohibitions and restrictions relating to powers and duties of organization units and of officers and employees of the Government. For example, there are more than two hundred separate pieces of legislation relating to operative and financial reports. These laws are scattered through the various statute books. They have never been considered as a whole by Congress. They were largely enacted to meet particular occasions, and many of them are now obsolete. Congress recognized this situation in the Budget Act by requesting the President to make recommendations as to these laws. This the President did last December by pointing out the necessity of bringing together all of the laws relating to the business administration of the Government and of revising and codifying them to harmonize with the new principles of fiscal responsibility and procedure set up under the Budget Act. The President further said that he proposed to have the Bureau of the Budget proceed with the compilation of such a code. As pointed out in our issue of last week, several States have already adopted administrative codes embodying a reorganization of the Government. An Administrative Code for the Federal Government should follow the main outlines of the Reorganization Act, and should contain only the basic policies for the business management of the Government. It should give a much wider discretion to the executive branch of the Government than at present exists, because the President is now, under the Budget Act and by his own volition, in full administrative control of his subordinates. Congress will, when this code is presented, have an opportunity to recognize fully the responsibility of the Executive for executive management. This may seem a paradox to the business man, but to the Government it is a goal yet to be realized. 2764 THE CHRONICLE not favor that, nor should anybody else, for we have already meddled too much and too unwisely with our fundamental law. There is nothing in the Constitution, however, to debar personal appearances before either branch of Congress. Each branch \"may determine the rules of its proceedings,\" and upon invitation or permission anybody might make remarks during the session hours. The President is under mandate to communicate to Congress any information or recommendation,as often as he chooses, and he is left to either written or oral methods. One sensible custom has been started by inviting the Vice-President to sit in Cabinet meetings, and there are also recent precedents in the letters by the President and by Secretary Mellon to the Fordney committee concerning the bonus, and in one or two personal appearances of the latter before that committee, for answering any questions that might be put. It is not likely that per,sonal appearance would become abused, and it would comport with the more direct and responsible information which the budget scheme intended and produces; it is also in line with the better and more intelligent \"team work,\" lacking heretofore, yet very desirable, between the executive and legislative departments. [Vor4. 114. will be paid better than similar workers are in outside industries. Right here the sharpest wail is set up, the men repeating the old demand to be constituted a preferred class, and a protest is entered against allowing the roads to do what every other employer does by hiring labor at current market prices. The roads must reduce their rates, so that business may revive; but they must not reduce their expenses, because men have a right to live. From a recent table comparing railway wages with similar outside wages,in 17 lines of work,it appears that the railway rate after July 1 will still be considerably above that outside, and also (what is of special consequence), while the wage rate outside has from two to twenty gradations, according to the worker's ability and efficiency, the roads must pay a \"flat\" rate, a fact which recalls to mind the gross outrages perpetrated a few years ago by Governmental \"classifications,\" whereby men were arbitrarily constituted members of more expert lines and entitled to higher pay and also several separate \"workers\" were required for the most ordinary repair jobs. This was pointed out long ago, and it was just a part of a long scheme of milking the roads for the benefit of \"humanity,\" a beautiful idea, but the cow has been going nearly dry under overimilking and scanty feeding.

The letter also makes once more that there will never be a better time to the bold assertion that \"railroad labor costs have have the issue fought to a finish. Chairman Hooper constantly declined during recent years,\" and Mr. of the Board not only takes up and refutes as \"utGompers comes forward, with his customary inaccu- terly baseless\" the specific assertions of the Jewell racy, to say that railway workers \"waited until July letter, but hopes the men will not take a course \"that 1 of 1920 for an increase in wages,\" although living will surely prove disastrous to the organizations and costs, had been rising for four years, whereas the the men composing them.\" He thinks \"the whole truth is that wages kept well up with those rising railroad question would be easy if it were not so hucosts, and the 1920 wage lift carried them past those; man,\" but all disputable subjects are human. Still, further, as has been shown and published repeatedly, he seems to expect an abandonment of the contract the present cuts leave the men better off in purchas- system, and if that becomes inconsistent with good ing power than they were in 1917; moreover, they business rules he may be gratified; otherwise , prob- JUNIO 241922.] THE CHRONICLE ably not. He predicts that \"before long many of the wrinkles will be ironed out of the railroad situation,\" and this may gradually come true, if (as he hopes) \"everybody will stop cussing\" and when,\"out of all this agitation, the American people finally learn the truth about the necessities of our great transportation system.\" Here is the most substantial hope: that the people, who are both the users and the owners, will begin to study, to understand, to care for, and to conserve their property. The head of the Central of New Jersey has sent to the men on that line a letter of friendly and reasonable remonstrance, urging them to keep calm and stay loyal. The head of the New Haven system also tells his men that neither employer nor employee, whether on tie farm or in general industry, or on railroads, \"can hope to escape the inexorable effect of economic law.\" This is as immovable and as fundamental as to say that nobody can hope to escape being affected by the weather. He adds that a strike against wage reductions would fail, through lack of public sympathy. It certainly would. Only eight months ago, Chief Lee of the Trainmen wrote a letter apropos of the strike fiasco in October, in which he said he had no hesitation \"in saying that,.in my lifetime, I have never known of a more unanimous feeling against us in the business and labor world than now exists.\" Can anybody except a fool deny that he correctly weighed the situation then, or imagine that it is one whit different now? COTTON ACREAGE CONDITION JUNE,1922. As last year there was a general and pronounced tendency to cut down the area devoted to cotton, so the present year there has been virtually everywhere a tendency in the other direction—that is, to reclaim for cotton the land allowed last year to remain fallow or which was devoted to other crops. The extent to which the movement towards increase has been carried is the problem confronting the investigator and it is a problem beset with unusual difficulties on this occasion. We have been engaged in the task of presenting these annual compilations for over half a century and have never made light of the undertaking or presented the results with a feeling of entire confidence in their absolute accuracy. There are always so many uncertainties involved in the collection and compilation of the returns, and as trained observers we know only too well how future contingencies may intervene to impair the best directed and most conscientious effort, rendering futile all precautions against imperfections and deficiencies. But the present year so many special factors exist, enormously increasing the uncertainties and the difficulty of the work, that it would be folly to pretend that at best our figures and statements are anything more than estimates and approximations—approximations, to be sure, as close as it is possible to make them by calling to our aid every source of information at command, but liable, nevertheless, to greater or smaller modification as the uncertainties referred to are resolved into actual facts, thereby removing the elements of conjecture and doubt. Drawbacks of one kind or another invariably exercise some influence to retard or advance planting over parts of the Cotton Belt, but in this instance there are controlling considerations of dominant importance affecting the entire area and upon the outcome of which depends both the ultimate extent of 2765 the planting and the amount of the production. First of all, weather conditions have been everywhere adverse—to a degree and extent to which we can recall no exact parallel in all our experience. In the second place, the adverse weather has everywhere been of the same type. In ordinary circumstances there will be drouth in one section, excessive rainfall in another and perhaps entirely normal conditions in still another part. Not so the current year. From one end of the belt to the other and all over it almost without exception there has been too much rain—eithmearly in the season or in May or for the whole of the year right up to June. In -other words, cotton growers have suffered from one common cause. It is proverbial that the rain falls on the just and the unjust alike, but in this instance the floodgates of heaven seem to have been opened, with the result of causing a veritable deluge over many of the biggest and best cotton areas of the South. The usual train of circumstances followed, namely floods and washouts which not only seriously interfered with farm work but in not a few instances rendered it wholly out of the question. Seeding, germination, growth, plowing and the cutting out of grass and weeds suffered. The farmer had to bide his time before he could go on with his work. To make matters worse, temperatures have been below the normal, cool nights being particularly complained of. Then, the lower Mississippi overflowed its banks and inundated large sections. Other rivers also overflowed, adding to the difficulties and the tribulations of the farmers. Because of the terrific rains, whole counties were washed out. On low lands this was necessarily a se-• rious matter. There was nothing for the farmer to do but to wait for the waters to recede or to drain off, and this was delayed because of the continuation of the rains. The remark applies not to one State or section, but to many. The consequence is that even at this late date numerous reports come to us from all over the South saying that planting has not yet been finished but remains in progress. Who can measure with exactness the extent of the planting so long as it is still under way? The result is that the crop is everywhere late—all the way from two to six weeks late—that the condition throughout nearly the entire cotton belt is low, though not any more so than in other recent bad years, and that cultivation is backward and weeds and grass are present to a much greater extent than is customarily the case. The importance of such a state of things obviously should not be minimized. At the same time,'it is easy to exaggerate its importance. The advent of favorable weather, namely the cessation of rain and a rise in temperatures, would effect a wonderful transformation within a very brief period. The character of the weather during July and August will determine the extent of the yield and the size of the crop. This, of course, is always the case, but it is most emphatically true in its application to the 1922 planting, since the crop is so late and laboring under such considerable drawbacks. The same may be said with reference to the possible ravages of the boll weevil which is a factor that cannot be ignored. With dry, forcing weather, the maturity of the crop and the formation of bolls would be so rapidly advanced that the possibility of harm from the depredations of the pest would be reduced to a minimum. There are some very strong elements in the situation as well as the weak ones just recounted. Proper 2766 weather is the all-important desideratum, but, given that, these favoring factors possess potentialities for a large yield that it would be a mistake to ignore. Not least important among these is the increase in the area devoted to cotton. There can be no question that planting the present season is substantially larger than the reduced planting of last year. This is so not only in one State, but in all the States-with the possible exception of South Carolina, where the best opinion leads to an estimate of acreage the same as in 1921. There has been much to discourage Southern farmers from adding to their planting in the circumstances already narrated, but as against this there has been the inducement of a very much higher market price. This latter always proves potent beyond every other consideration. For this reason it seems desirable to indicate how striking the contrast in the matter of price has been the present season compared with the market prices of a year ago. On March 1 last year middling upland spot cotton in New York was quoted at 11.65 cents, on April 1 it was quoted at 12.00 cents; on both May 1 and June 1 at 12.90 cents, and on July 1 at 12.00 cents. Note now the difference in 1922: on March 1 1922 the middling upland spot price in New York was 18.70 cents; on April 1 18.10 cents; on May 1 18.95 cents, and on June 1 21.00 cents, with the quotation the present week (June 20) up to 23.30 cents. As a matter of record, we introduce here a table showing the New York price for the first of each month for the last eleven years: • PRICE OF MIDDLING UPLAND COTTON IN NEW YORK ON DATES GIVEN AND AVERAGE FOR SEASON. 1921- 1920- 1919- 1918- 1917- 1916- 1915- 1914- 1913- 1912-19111922. 1921. 1920. 1919. 1918. 1917. 1916. 1915. 1911. 1913. 1912.

April 1 last year the farm price was only 9.4 cents; on May 1 it was the same; on June 1 it was 9.8 cents and on July 1 9.6 cents. The present year, on the other hand, the April 1 farm price was 16.0 cents; on May 1 15.9 cents, and on June 1 18.7 cents, as will be seen from the following table covering the ,same eleven years embraced in the table already given: AVERAGE PRICE OF COTTON ON THE FARM. 1921- 1920- 1919- 1918- 1017- 1916- 1915- 1914- 1913- 1912- 19111922. 1921. 1920. 1919. 1918. 1917. 1916. 1915. 1914. 1913. 1912.

Thus in Oklahoma the average the present year was 17.0 cents, against 7.8; in Arkansas, 18.6 cents against 9.5; in Texas, 18.7 cents against 9.9; and in Louisiana 17.5 cents against 9.6. East of the Mississippi River, of course, the differences in favor of 1922 were also very striking, Georgia, for instance, showing an average farm price June 1 1922 of 19.3 cents as compared with only 10.5 cents on June 1 1921. There was in this year's higher price a compelling inducement to reclaim for cotton every acre of land that could be made available, and this same inducement still exists and will lead the planter to bring under cultivation additional inundated land, inasmuch as during the current month of June market prices for the staple, as already pointed out, have been making even further strides upward. The situation, accordingly, is that while in 1921 no motive whatever existed for adding to the size of the planted area, but on the contrary, every instinct suggested reducing the plantings since at the low prices then current even the best situated and most fertile areas had no chance of profitable results, the situation in 1.922 was the precise reverse of this, ti higher level of values assuring the certainty of satis;actory financial returns, besides which the statistical situation of cotton throughout the world is such that there is a reasonable prospect of a ready market for every bale of cotton that can be raised. We now give in the following table our estimate of the planting in all the different States and for the country as a whole. In applying our percentages of increase in area for the present year we use the final revised figures of acreage for last season recently issued by the Department of Agriculture and prepared in conjunction with the Census authorities. There seems no reason why these figures should not be regarded as absolutely correct after the pains that have been taken to make them so. The early estimate of the Agricultural Department of last year's acreage, when the tendency was so strongly to reduce acreage, overstated the amount of the decrease, making it 28.4%. The final revised figures showed a reduction of only 14.5%. The Department has indicated that the overstatement followed from the fact that the appropriation allowed it by Congress was not sufficient to enable it properly to verify the early returns. We are not questioning the accuracy of this explanation when we say that returns of correspondents made early in the seAson are always apt to exaggerate the importance of a change where the movement is very strongly in one direction, as was the case in 1921, and that allowance must be made for this proneness to exaggerate. We ourselves undertook to allow for such customary error of judgment in our estimates of last year, and made the decrease only 24.75%, as against the Department's decrease of 28.4%. But it appears from the final census figures showing, as already noted, only 14.5% decrease, that we did not go far enough in discounting the tendency to exaggerate. What probably happened was that the majority of planters, after having solemnly resolved to reduce acreage to the extent of 30 or 40%, slyly concluded that they would not go asfar as this in their own case but leave it to their neighbors to go to the full limit, and thereby gain a little advantage for themselves.

JUNE 241922.] THE CHRONICLE It will be seen thatexceptin So.Carolina we show an increase in every State—the ratios of addition being largest in the minor cotton growing States—and that for the cotton belt as a whole we figure the percentage of increase at 10.5%. It has been our purpose to be ultra-conservative, and if these figures err at all they should err in being too small. The 10.5% increase brings the total area planted in the whole cotton belt up to 35,025,000 acres, which, while a large total, is not quite as large as in some previous seasons. We add the following table to show what the acreage put into cotton has been in each year back to 1910 and what the crop and the yield per acre have been in each of the same years: ACREAGE AND PRODUCTION OF COTTON IN UNITED STATES, 1910-22.
