        "text": "NOVEL PLANT ACYLTRANSFERASES SPECIFIC FOR LONG-CHAINED, MULTIPLY UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS\n\nThe present invention relates to a process for the production of long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids in an organism by introducing, into the organism, nucleic acids which code for polypeptides with acyltransferase activity. These nucleic acid sequences, if appropriate together with further nucleic acid sequences which code for polypeptides of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism biosynthesis, can advantageously be expressed in the organism. Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for the production of oils and/or triacylglycerides with an elevated content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nThe invention furthermore relates to the nucleic acid sequences, nucleic acid constructs, vectors and organisms comprising the nucleic acid sequences according to the invention, vectors comprising the nucleic acid sequences and/or the nucleic acid constructs and to transgenic organisms comprising the abovementioned nucleic acid sequences, nucleic acid constructs and/or vectors.\n\nA further part of the invention relates to oils, lipids and/or fatty acids produced by the process according to the invention and to their use.\n\nFatty acids and triacylglycerides have a multiplicity of applications in the food industry, in animal nutrition, in cosmetics and in the pharmacological sector. Depending on whether they are free saturated or unsaturated fatty acids or else triacylglycerides with an elevated content of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, they are suitable for very different applications. Polyunsaturated w-3-fatty acids and w-6-fatty acids are therefore an important constituent in animal and human food. Owing to the present-day composition of human food, an addition of polyunsaturated w-3-fatty acids, which are preferentially found in fish oils, to the food is particularly important.\n\nThus, for example, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (= DHA, C22:6,64,7,10,13,16,19) or eicosapentaenoic acid (= EPA, C20:5 5'8.11'14'17) are added to baby formula to improve the nutritional value. The unsaturated fatty acid DHA is said to have a positive effect on the development of the brain.\n\nHereinbelow, polyunsaturated fatty acids are referred to as PUFA, PUFAs, LCPUFA or LCPUFAs (Roly unsaturated fatty acids, PUFA, long chain Roly unsaturated fatty acids, LCPUFA).\n\nThe various fatty acids and triglycerides are mainly obtained from microorganisms such as Mortierella and Schizochytrium or from oil-producing plants such as soybean, oilseed rape, algae such as Crypthecodinium or Phaeodactylum and others, where la they are obtained, as a rule, in the form of their triacylglycerides (=\n\ntriglyperides =\n\ntriglycerols). However, they can also be obtained from animals, such as, for example, fish. The free fatty acids are advantageously prepared by hydrolysis. Higher polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DHA, EPA, arachidonic acid (= ARA, c20:4A5,8.11,14, ) dihomo-y-linolenic acid (C20:3 8,11,14) or docosapentaenoic acid (DPA,\n\n2 C22:5A7,10,13,16,19) can not be isolated from oil crop plants such as oilseed rape, soybean, sunflower or safflower. Conventional natural sources of these fatty acids are fish such as herring, salmon, sardine, redfish, eel, carp, trout, halibut mackerel, zander or tuna, or algae.\n\nDepending on the intended use, oils with saturated or unsaturated fatty acids are preferred. In human nutrition, for example, lipids with unsaturated fatty acids, specifically polyunsaturated fatty acids, are preferred. The polyunsaturated w-\n\n3-fatty acids are said to have a positive effect on the cholesterol level in the blood and thus on the possibility of preventing heart disease. The risk of heart disease, stroke or hypertension can be reduced markedly by adding these w-3-fatty acids to the food.\n\nAlso, w-3-fatty acids have a positive effect on inflammatory, specifically on chronically inflammatory, processes in association with immunological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. They are therefore added to foodstuffs, specifically to dietetic foodstuffs, or are employed in medicaments. w-6-Fatty acids such as arachidonic acid tend to have a negative effect on these disorders in connection with these rheumatic diseases on account of our usual dietary intake.\n\nw-3- and w-6-fatty acids are precursors of tissue hormones, known as eicosanoids, such as the prostaglandins, which are derived from dihomo-y-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, and of the thromoxanes and leukotrienes, which are derived from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Eicosanoids (known as the PG2 series) which are formed from w-6-fatty acids generally promote inflammatory reactions, while eicosanoids (known as the PG3 series) from w-3-fatty acids have little or no proinfiammatory effect.\n\nOwing to the positive characteristics of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, there has been no lack of attempts in the past to make available genes which are involved in the synthesis of fatty acids or triglycerides for the production of oils in various organisms with a modified content of unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, WO 91/13972 and its US\n\nequivalent describe a 4-9Â¨desaturase. WO 93/11245 claims a A-15-desaturase and WO 94/11516 a A-12-desaturase. Further desaturases are described, for example, in EPÂ¨A-0 550 162, WO 94/18337, WO 97/30582, WO 97/21340, WO 95/18222, EP-A-0 794 250, Stukey et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, 1990:20144-20149, Wada et al., Nature 347, 1990: 200-203 or Huang et al., Lipids 34, 1999: 649-659. However, the biochemical characterization of the various desaturases has been insufficient to date since the enzymes, being membrane-bound proteins, present great difficulty in their isolation and characterization (McKeon et al., Methods in Enzymol. 71, 1981:\n\n12147, Wang et al., Plant Physiol. Biochem., 26, 1988: 777-792). As a rule, membrane-bound desaturases are characterized by being introduced into a suitable organism which is subsequently analyzed for enzyme activity by analyzing the starting materials and the products. A-6Â¨Desaturases are described in WO 93/06712, US 5,614,393, WO 96/21022, WO 00/21557 and WO 99/27111 and the application for the production in transgenic organisms is described in WO 98/46763, WO\n\nand WO 98/46765. In this context, the expression of various desaturases and the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids are also described and claimed in WO 99/64616 or WO 98/46776. As regards the expression efficacy of desaturases and its effect on the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, it must be noted that the expression of a single desaturase as described to date has only resulted in low contents of unsaturated fatty acids/lipids such as, for example, y-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid. Moreover, a mixture of w-3- and w-6-fatty acids was obtained, as a rule.\n\nEspecially suitable microorganisms for the production of PUFAs are microalgae such as Phaeodactylum tricomutum, Porphoridium species, Thraustochytrium species, Schizochytrium species or Crypthecodinium species, ciliates such as Stylonychia or Colpidium, fungi such as Mortierella, Entomophthora or Mucor and/or mosses such as Physcomitrella, Ceratodon and Marchantia (R. Vazhappilly & F. Chen (1998) Botanica Marina 41: 553-558; K. Totani & K. Oba (1987) Lipids 22: 1060-1062; M. Akimoto et al.\n\n(1998) Appl. Biochemistry and Biotechnology 73: 269-278). Strain selection has resulted in the development of a number of mutant strains of the microorganisms in question which produce a series of desirable compounds including PUFAs.\n\nHowever, the mutation and selection of strains with an improved production of a particular molecule such as the polyunsaturated fatty acids is a time-consuming and difficult process. This is why recombinant methods as described above are preferred whenever possible. However, only limited amounts of the desired polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DPA, EPA or ARA can be produced with the aid of the abovementioned microorganisms, and, depending on the microorganism used, these are generally obtained as fatty acid mixtures of, for example, EPA, DPA and DHA.\n\nThe biosynthesis of LCPUFAs and the incorporation of LCPUFAs into membranes or triacylglycerides proceeds via various metabolic pathways (A. Abbadi et al.\n\n(2001) European Journal of Lipid Science & Technology 103:106-113). In bacteria such as Vibrio, and microalgae, such as Schizochytrium, malonyl-CoA is converted into.\n\nLCPUFAs via an LCPUFA-producing polyketide synthase (J.G. Metz et al. (2001) Science 293: 290-293; WO 00/42195; WO 98/27203; WO 98/55625). In microalgae, such as Phaeodactylum, and mosses, such as Physcomitrella, unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid or linolenic acid are converted, in the form of their acyl-CoAs, in a plurality of desaturation and elongation steps to give LCPUFAs (T.K. Zank et al. (2000) Biochemical Society Transactions 28: 654-658). In mammals, the biosynthesis of DNA\n\ncomprises a chain shortening via beta-oxidation, in addition to desaturation and elongation steps.\n\nIn microorganisms and lower plants, LCPUFAs are present either exclusively in the form of membrane lipids, as is the case in Physcomitrella and Phaeodactylum, or in membrane lipids and triacylglycerides, as is the case in Schizochytrium and Mortierella.\n\nIncorporation of LCPUFAs into lipids and oils is catalyzed by various acyltransferases and transacylases. These enzymes are already known to carry out the incorporation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids [A.R. Slabas (2001) J. Plant Physiology 158:\n\n505-513; M. Frentzen (1998) Fett/Lipid 100: 161-166); S. Cases et al. (1998) Proc. Nat.\n\n4 Acad. Sci. USA 95: 13018-130231. The acyltransferases are enzymes of the \"Kennedy pathway\", which are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane system of the endoplasmic reticulum, referred to as \"ER\" hereinbelow. ER membranes may be isolated experimentally as \"microsomal fractions\" from various organisms [D.S.\n\nKnutzon et al. (1995) Plant Physiology 109: 999-1006; S. Mishra & Y. Kamisaka (2001) Biochemistry 355: 315-322; US 5968791]. These ER-bound acyltransferases in the microsomal fraction use acyl-CoA as the activated form of fatty acids.\n\nGlycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, referred to as GPAT hereinbelow, catalyzes the incorporation of acyl groups at the sn-1 position of glycerol-3-phosphate. 1-Acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (E.C. 2.3.1.51), also known as lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase and referred to as LPAAT hereinbelow, catalyzes the incorporation of acyl groups at the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidic acid, abbreviated as LPA hereinbelow. After dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid by phosphatidic acid phosphatase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, referred to as DAGAT\n\nhereinbelow, catalyzes the incorporation of acyl groups at the sn-3 position of diacylglycerols. Apart from these Kennedy pathway enzymes, further enzymes capable of incorporating acyl groups from membrane lipids into triacylglycerides are involved in the incorporation of fatty acids into triacylglycerides, namely phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase, referred to as PDAT hereinbelow, and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase, referred to as LPCAT. Other enzymes too, such as lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) can be involved in the transfer of acyl groups from membrane lipids into triacylglycerides.\n\nIn WO 98/54302, Tjoelker et al. disclose a human lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase and its potential use for the therapy of diseases, as a diagnostic, and a method for identifying modulators of the human LPAAT. In WO 98/54303, Leung et al.\n\ndescribe mammalian lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases. Moreover, Leung et al.\n\ndisclose a method for screening pharmaceutical compounds for use, for example, in the treatment of inflammations.\n\nMoreover, a multiplicity of acyltransferases with a wide range of enzymatic functions have been described in the literature and patents; thus, for example, WO\n\n98/55632 and WO 93/10241 describe fatty acid alcohol acyltransferases which are involved in wax synthesis. WO 98/55631 describes a DAGAT (diacylglycerol acyltransferase) from Mortierella ramanniana and a wax synthase from jojoba which also has DAGAT\n\nactivity. Slabas et al. (WO 94/13814) disclose a membrane-bound sn2-specific acyltransferase which has a different selectivity in the incorporation of monounsaturated erucic acid for the sn2 position and thus makes possible an increased erucic acid yield in oilseed rape. WO 96/24674 describes a corresponding enzyme or gene from Limnanthes douglasii. In WO 95/27791, Davies et al.\n\ndescribe LPAATs which are specific for medium-length fatty acids and incorporate these into the sn2 position of triglycerides. Further novel plant acyltransferase sequences which have been found via homology comparisons with sequences from public databases are described by Lessner et a;. (W0'00/18889). Information on the specific function of these acyltransferase sequences or biochemical data on the corresponding enzymes cannot be found in WO 00/18889.\n\nThe enzymic activity of an LPCAT was first described in rats [Land (1960) Journal of Biological Chemistry 235: 2233-2237]. A plastidic LPCAT isoform [Akermoun et at.\n\n5 (2000) Biochemical Society Transactions 28: 713-715] and an ER-bound isoform [Tumaney and Rajasekharan (1999) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1439: 47-56;\n\nFraser and Stobart, Biochemical Society Transactions (2000) 28: 715-7718]\n\nexist in plants. LPCAT is involved in the biosynthesis and transacylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in animals as well as in plants [Stymne and Stobart (1984) Biochem. J. 223:\n\n305-314; Stymne and Stobart (1987) in 'The Biochemistry of Plants: a Comprehensive Treatise', Vol. 9 (Stumpf, P.K. ed.) pp. 175-214, Academic Press, New York].\n\nAn important function of LPCAT or, more generally, of an acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, referred to as LPLAT hereinbelow, in the ATP-independent synthesis of acyl-CoA from phospholipids has been described by Yamashita et at. (2001;\n\nJournal of Biological Chemistry 276: 26745-26752).\n\nDespite a lot of biochemical data, no genes coding for LPCAT have been identified previously. Genes of various other plant acyltransferases have been isolated and are described in WO 00/18889 (Novel Plant Acyltransferases).\n\nHigher plants comprise polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3). ARA, EPA and DNA are found not at all in the seed oil of higher plants, or only in traces (E. Ucciani: Nouveau Dictionnaire des Huiles Vegetates.\n\nTechnique & Documentation Â¨ Lavoisier, 1995. ISBN: 2-7430-0009-0). It is advantageous to produce LCPUFAs in higher plants, preferably in oil seeds such as oilseed rape, linseed, sunflower and soybean, since large amounts of high-quality LCPUFAs for the food industry, animal nutrition and pharmaceutical purposes may be obtained at low costs in this way. To this end, it is advantageous to introduce into and express in oil seeds genes coding for enzymes of the biosynthesis of LCPUFAs by genetic engineering methods. Said genes code, for example, for A-6-desaturase, 16,\n\n6-elongase, A-5-desaturase, A-5-elongase and A-4-desaturase. These genes may advantageously be isolated from microorganisms and lower plants which produce LCPUFAs and incorporate them in the membranes or triacylglycerides. Thus, A-6-desaturase genes have already been isolated from the moss Physcomitrella patens and A-6-elongase genes have already been isolated from P. patens and the nematode C. elegans.\n\nTransgenic plants which express genes coding for enzymes of LCPUFA\n\nbiosynthesis are suitable for producing small amounts of these LCPUFAs; however, there is the risk that the latter are incorporated not into triacylglycerides, but into membranes, since the endogenous acyltransferases and transacylases may not recognize LCPUFAs as substrate and, accordingly, do not incorporate them into triacylglycerides.\n\nThis is undesired for the following reasons: (i) the main lipid fraction in oil seeds are triacylglycerides. This is why, for economical reasons, it is necessary to concentrate =\n\nLCPUFAs in triacylglycerides. LCPUFAs which are incorporated into membranes can modify the physical characteristics of the membranes and thus have harmful effects on the integrity and transport characteristics of the membranes and on the stress tolerance of plants.\n\nFirst transgenic plants which comprise and express genes coding for enzymes of LCPUFA biosynthesis and produce LCPUFAs have been described for the first time, for example, in DE 102 19 203 (process for the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plants). However, these plants produce LCPUFAs in amounts which require further optimization for processing the oils present in said plants.\n\nIn order to enable food and feed to be enriched with these polyunsaturated fatty acids, there is therefore a great need for a simple, inexpensive process for producing said polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially in eukaryotic systems.\n\nOne aspect of the invention is a process for the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids in a microorganism or a plant, which comprises the following steps:\n\na) introducing into the microorganism or plant, at least one nucleic acid with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; or b) introducing into the microorganism or plant, at least one nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence having at least 95% identity with SEQ\n\nID NO: 16, wherein the nucleic acid molecule codes for a polypeptide having lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity; or c) introducing into the microorganism or plant, at least one nucleic acid which codes for a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:\n\n17, or which codes for a polypeptide having at least 95% identity with SEQ ID\n\nNO:\n\n17 and having lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, and d) culturing and harvesting the microorganism or plant producing polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\n..

A minor extent is understood as meaning that the saturated fatty acids are reacted with less than 5%, advantageously less than 3%, especially advantageously with less than 2% of the activity in comparison with polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids which are produced may be produced in the process as a single product or be present in a fatty acid mixture.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequences used in the process of the invention are isolated nucleic acid sequences which code for polypeptides with lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity.\n\nThe polyunsaturated fatty acids produced in the process are advantageously bound in membrane lipids and/or triacylglycerides but may also occur in the organisms as free fatty acids or else bound in the form of other fatty acid esters. In this context, they may be present as stated as \"pure products\" or else advantageously in the form of mixtures of various fatty acids or mixtures of different glycerides. The various fatty acids bound in the triacylglycerides can be derived here from short-chain fatty acids having from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, medium-chain fatty acids having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms or long-chain fatty acids having from 14 to 24 carbon atoms, with preference being given to the\n\n8 long-chain fatty acids and particular preference being given to the long-chain fatty acids, LCPUFAs, of C18-, C20-, C22- and/or C24-fatty acids.\n\nThe process of the invention advantageously produces fatty acid esiers with polyunsaturated C18-, C20-, C22- and/or C24-fatty acid molecules, with at least two double bonds being present in the fatty acid ester. These fatty acid molecules preferably comprise three, four or five double bonds and advantageously lead to the synthesis of hexadecadienoic acid (C16:2 9=12), 'y-linolenic acid (= GLA, C18:3 6.9'12), stearidonic acid (= SDA, C18:46'9'1215), dihomo-y-linolenic acid (= DGLA, 20:3 m,11,14), eicosatetraenoic acid (= ETA, C20:4 5'8.11.14), arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or mixtures thereof, preferably EPA and/or ARA.\n\nThe fatty acid esters with polyunsaturated C18-, C20-, C22- and/or C24-fatty acid molecules can be isolated, from the organisms which have been used for the preparation of the fatty acid esters, in the form of an oil or lipid, for example in the form of compounds such as sphingolipids, phosphoglycerides, lipids, glycolipids such as glycosphingolipid, phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-choline, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol or diphosphatidylglycerol, monoacylglycerides, diacylglycerides, triacylglycerides or other fatty acid esters such as the acetyl-coenzyme A esters which comprise the polyunsaturated fatty acids with at least two, preferably three double bonds;\n\nadvantageously they are isolated in the form of their diacylglycerides, triacylglycerides and/or in the form of phosphatidylcholine, especially preferably in the form of the triacylglycerides. In addition to these esters, the polyunsaturated fatty acids are also present in the organisms, advantageously the plants, as free fatty acids or bound in other compounds. As a rule, the various abovementioned compounds (fatty acid esters and free fatty acids) are present in the organisms with an approximate distribution of 80 to 90% by weight of triglycerides, 2 to 5% by weight of diglycerides, 5 to 10%\n\nby weight of monoglycerides, 1 to 5% by weight of free fatty acids, 2 to 8% by weight of phospholipids, the total of the various compounds amounting to 100% by weight.\n\nThe process according to the invention yields the LCPUFAs produced in a content of at = 30 least 3% by weight, advantageously at least 5% by weight, preferably at least 8% by weight, especially preferably at least 10% by weight, most preferably at least 15% by = weight, based on the total fatty acids in the transgenic organisms, advantageously in a transgenic plant. The fatty acids are advantageously produced in bound form.\n\nWith the aid of the nucleic acids used in the process according to the invention, these unsaturated fatty acids can be brought into the sn1, sn2 and/or sn3 position of the triglycerides which are advantageously prepared. Since a plurality of reaction steps are = performed by the starting compounds hexadecadienoic acid (C16:2), linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3) in the process according to the invention, the end products of the process such as, for example, arachidonic acid (ARA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are not obtained as absolutely pure products;\n\nminor traces of the precursors are always present in the end product. If, for example, both linoleic acid and linolenic acid are present in the starting organism and the starting\n\n9 plant, the end products such as ARA and EPA are present as mixtures. The precursors should advantageously not amount to more than 20% by weight, preferably not to more than 15% by weight, especially preferably not to more than 10% by weight, most preferably not to more than 5% by weight, based on the amount of the end product in question. Advantageously, only ARA or only EPA, bound or as free acids, are produced as end products in a transgenic plant in the process according to the invention. If both compounds (ARA and EPA) are produced simultaneously, they are advantageously produced in a ratio of at least 1:2 (EPA:ARA), advantageously of at least 1:3, preferably 1:4, especially preferably 1:5.\n\nOwing to the nucleic acid sequences according to the invention, an increase in the yield of polyunsaturated fatty acids of at least 50%, advantageously of at least 80%, especially advantageously of at least 100%, very especially advantageously of at least 150%, in comparison with the nontransgenic starting organism, can be obtained by comparison in GC analysis (see examples). In a further advantageous embodiment, the yield of polyunsaturated fatty acids can be increased by at least 200%, preferably by at least 250%, very especially preferably by at least 300%.\n\nChemically pure polyunsaturated fatty acids or fatty acid compositions can also be synthesized by the processes described above. To this end, the fatty acids or the fatty acid compositions are isolated from the organism, such as the microorganisms or the plants or the culture medium in or on which the organisms have been grown, or from the organism and the culture medium, in the known manner, for example via extraction, distillation, crystallization, chromatography or combinations of these methods. These chemically pure fatty acids or fatty acid compositions are advantageous for applications in the food industry sector, the cosmetics industry sector and especially the pharmacological industry sector.\n\nSuitable organisms for the production in the process according to the invention are, in principle, any organisms such as microorganisms, nonhuman animals or plants.\n\nAdvantageously the process according to the invention employs transgenic organisms such as fungi, such as Mortierella or Traustochytrium, yeasts such as Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces, mosses such as Physcomitrella or Ceratodon, nonhuman animals such as Caenorhabditis, algae such as Crypthecodinium or Phaeodactylum or plants such as dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Organisms which are especially advantageously used in the process according to the invention are organisms which belong to the oil-producing organisms, that is to say which are used for the production of oils, such as fungi, such as Mortierella or Traustochytrium, algae such as Crypthecodinium, Phaeodactylum, or plants, in particular plants, preferably oil = crop plants which comprise large amounts of lipid compounds, such as peanut, oilseed rape, canola, sunflower, safflower, poppy, mustard, hemp, castor-oil plant, olive, sesame, Calendula, Punica, evening primrose, verbascum, thistle, wild roses, hazelnut, , 40 almond, macadamia, avocado, bay, pumpkin/squash, linseed, soybean, pistachios, = borage, trees (oil palm, coconut or walnut) or arable crops such as maize, wheat, rye, oats, triticale, rice, barley, cotton, cassava, pepper, Tagetes, Solanaceae plants such as potato, tobacco, eggplant and tomato, Vicia species, pea, alfalfa or bushy plants (coffee, cacao, tea), Salix species, and perennial grasses and fodder crops.\n\nPreferred plants according to the invention are oil crop plants such as peanut, oilseed rape, canola, sunflower, safflower, poppy, mustard, hemp, castor-oil plant, olive, Calendula, 5 Punica, evening primrose, pumpkin/squash, linseed, soybean, borage, trees (oil palm, coconut). Especially preferred are plants which are high in C18:2- and/or C18:3-fatty acids, such as sunflower, safflower, tobacco, verbascum, sesame, cotton, pumpkin/squash, poppy, evening primrose, walnut, linseed, hemp, thistle or safflower.\n\nVery especially preferred plants are plants such as safflower, sunflower, poppy,\n\n10 evening primrose, walnut, linseed or hemp.\n\nIt is advantageous to the inventive process described to introduce, in addition to the nucleic acids introduced in step (a) to (f) of the process, further nucleic acids which code for enzymes of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism into the organism.\n\nIn principle, all genes of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism can be used in the process for the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids, advantageously in combination with the inventive acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase. Genes of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism selected from the group consisting of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase(s), acyl-ACP [= acyl carrier protein] desaturase(s), acyl-ACP thioesterase(s), fatty acid acyltransferase(s), acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases, fatty acid synthase(s), fatty acid hydroxylase(s), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase(s), acyl-coenzyme A\n\noxidase(s), fatty acid desaturase(s), fatty acid acetylenases, lipoxygenases, triacylglycerol lipases, alleneoxide synthases, hydroperoxide lyases or fatty acid elongase(s) are advantageously used in combination with the acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase. Genes selected from the group of the acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases, A-4-desaturases, A-5-desaturases, A-6-desaturases, A-8-desaturases, A-9-desaturases, A-12-desaturases, A-5-elongases, A-6-elongases or A-9-elongases are especially preferably used in combination with the abovementioned genes for lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, it being possible to use individual genes or a plurality of genes in combination.\n\nOwing to the enzymatic activity of the nucleic acids used in the process according to the invention which code for polypeptides with lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity, advantageously in combination with nucleic acid sequences which code for polypeptides of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism, such as the acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity, the A-4-, A-5-, A-6-, desaturase or the A-5-, A-6- or A-9-elongase activity, a wide range of polyunsaturated fatty acids can be produced in the process according to the invention.\n\nDepending on the choice of the organisms, such as the advantageous plant, used for the process according to the invention, mixtures of the various polyunsaturated fatty acids or individual polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as EPA or ARA, can be produced in free or bound form. Depending on the prevailing fatty acid composition in the starting plant\n\n11 (C18:2- or C18:3-fatty acids), fatty acids which are derived from C18:2-fatty acids, such as GLA, DGLA or ARA, or fatty acids which are derived from Cl 8:3-fatty acids, such as SDA, ETA or EPA, are thus obtained. If only linoleic acid (= LA, C18:2 9.12) is present as unsaturated fatty acid in the plant used for the process, the process can only afford GLA, DGLA and ARA as products, all of which can be present as free fatty acids or in bound form. If only a-linolenic acid (= ALA, C18:3 9'12.15) is present as unsaturated fatty acid in the plant used for the process, as is the case, for example, in linseed, the process can only afford SDA, ETA and EPA as products, all of which can be present as free fatty acids or in bound form, as described above. By modifying the activity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase advantageously in combination with acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-5-, A-6-desaturase and/or A-6-elongase or with acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-5-, A-8-desaturase and/or A-9-elongase or in combination with only the first three genes, acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-6-desaturase and/or A-6-elongase or acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-8-desaturase and A-9-elongase, of the synthesis cascade, it is possible to produce, in a targeted fashion, only individual products in the abovementioned organisms, advantageously in the abovementioned plants. Owing to the activity of A-6-desaturase and A-6-elongase, for example, GLA and DGLA, or SDA and ETA, are formed, depending on the starting plant and unsaturated fatty acid. DGLA or ETA or mixtures of these are preferably formed. If A-5-desaturase is additionally introduced into the organisms, advantageously into the plant, ARA or EPA is additionally formed.\n\nThis also applies to organisms into which A-8-desaturase and A-9-elongase have been introduced previously. Advantageously, only ARA or EPA or mixtures of these are synthesized, depending on the fatty acid present in the organism, or in the plant, which acts as starting substance for the synthesis. Since biosynthetic cascades are involved, the end products in question are not present in pure form in the organisms.\n\nSmall amounts of the precursor compounds are always additionally present in the end product. These small amounts amount to less than 20% by weight, advantageously less than 15% by weight, especially advantageously less than 10% by weight, most advantageously less than 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1% by weight, based on the end product DGLA, ETA or their mixtures, or ARA, EPA or their mixtures.\n\nTo increase the yield in the described method for the production of oils and/or triglycerides with an advantageously elevated content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, it is advantageous to increase the amount of starting product for the synthesis of fatty acids; this can be achieved for example by introducing, into the organism, a nucleic acid which codes for a polypeptide with A-12-desaturase. This is particularly advantageous in oil-producing organisms such as oilseed rape which are high in oleic acid. Since these organisms are only low in linoleic acid (Mikoklajczak et al., Journal of the American Oil Chemical Society, 38, 1961, 678 - 681), the use of the abovementioned A-12-desaturases for producing the starting material linoleic acid is advantageous.\n\n12 Nucleic acids used in the process according to the invention are advantageously derived from plants such as algae such as lsochrysis or Crypthecodinium, algae/diatoms such as Phaeodactylum, mosses such as Physcomitr,ella or Ceratodon, or higher plants such as the Primulaceae such as Aleuritia, Calendula stellata, Osteospermum spinescens or Osteospermum hyoseroides, microorganisms such as fungi, such as Aspergillus, Thraustochytrium, Phytophthora, Entomophthora, Mucor or Mortierella, bacteria such as Shewanella, yeasts or animals such as nematodes such as Caenorhabditis, insects or humans. The nucleic acids are advantageously derived from fungi, animals, or from plants such as algae or mosses, preferably from nematodes such as Caenorhabditis.\n\nThe process according to the invention advantageously employs the abovementioned nucleic acid sequences or their derivative or homologs which code for polypeptides which retain the enzymatic activity of the proteins encoded by nucleic acid sequences.\n\nThese sequences, individually or in combination with the nucleic acid sequences which code for lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase are cloned into expression constructs and used for the introduction into, and expression in, organisms.\n\nOwing to their construction, these expression constructs make possible an advantageous optimal synthesis of the polyunsaturated fatty acids produced in the process according to the invention.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the process furthermore comprises the step of obtaining a cell or an intact organism which comprises the nucleic acid sequences used in the process, where the cell and/or the organism is transformed with a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention which codes for the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, a gene construct or a vector as described below, alone or in combination with further nucleic acid sequences which code for proteins of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism. In a further preferred embodiment, this process furthermore comprises the step of obtaining the fine chemical from the culture.\n\nThe culture can, for example, take the form of a fermentation culture, for example in the case of the cultivation of microorganisms, such as, for example, Mortierella, Saccharomyces or Traustochytrium, or a greenhouse- or field-grown culture of a plant.\n\nThe cell or the organism produced thus is advantageously a cell of an oil-producing organism, such as an oil crop plant, such as, for example, peanut, oilseed rape, canola, linseed, hemp, soybean, safflower, sunflowers or borage.\n\nIn the case of plant cells, plant tissue or plant organs, \"growing\" is understood as meaning, for example, the cultivation on or in a nutrient medium, or of the intact plant on or in a substrate, for example in a hydroponic culture, potting compost or on arable land.\n\nFor the purposes of the invention, \"transgenic\" or \"recombinant\" means, with regard to the example of a nucleic acid sequence, an expression cassette (= gene construct) or a\n\n13 vector comprising the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention or an organism transformed with the nucleic acid sequences, expression cassette or vector according to the invention, all those constructions brought about by recombinant methods in which either a) the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention, or b) a genetic control sequence which is operably linked with the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention, for example a promoter, or c) (a) and (b) are not located in their natural genetic environment or have been modified by recombinant methods, it being possible for the modification to take the form of, for example, a substitution, addition, deletion, inversion or insertion of one or more nucleotide residues. The natural genetic environment is understood as meaning the natural genomic or chromosomal locus in the original organism or the presence in a genomic library. In the case of a genomic library, the natural genetic environment of the nucleic acid sequence is preferably retained, at least in part. The environment flanks the nucleic acid sequence at least on one side and has a sequence length of at least 50 bp, preferably at least 500 bp, especially preferably at least 1000 bp, most preferably at least 5000 bp. A naturally occurring expression cassette Â¨ for example the naturally occurring combination of the natural promoter of the inventive nucleic acid sequences with the corresponding lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase genes - becomes a transgenic expression cassette when this expression cassette is modified by nonnatural, synthetic (\"artificial\") methods such as, for example, mutagenic treatment. Suitable methods are described, for example, in US 5,565,350 or WO 00/15815.\n\nA transgenic organism or transgenic plant for the purposes of the invention is understood as meaning, as above, that the nucleic acids used in the process are not at their natural locus in the genome of an organism, it being possible for the nucleic acids to be expressed homologously or heterologously. However, as mentioned, transgenic also means that, while the nucleic acids according to the invention are at their natural position in the genome of an organism, the sequence has been modified with regard to the natural sequence, andlor that the regulatory sequences of the natural sequences have been modified. Transgenic is preferably understood as meaning the expression of the nucleic acids according to the invention at an unnatural locus in the genome, i.e.\n\nhomologous or, preferably, heterologous expression of the nucleic acids takes place.\n\nPreferred transgenic organisms are fungi such as Mortierella, mosses such as Physcomitrella, algae such as Cryptocodinium or plants such as the oil crop plants.\n\nSuitable organisms or host organisms for the nucleic acids, the expression cassette or the vector used in the process according to the invention are, in principle, advantageously all organisms which are capable of synthesizing fatty acids, specifically\n\n14 unsaturated fatty acids, and/or which are suitable for the expression of recombinant genes. Examples which may be mentioned are plants such as Arabidopsis, Asteraceae such as Calendula or crop plants such as soybean, peanut, castor-oil plant, sunflower, maize, cotton, flax, oilseed rape, coconut, oil palm, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) or cacao bean, microorganisms, such as fungi, for example the genus Mortierella, Thraustochytrium, Saprolegnia, or Pythium, bacteria, such as the genus Escherichia, or Shewanella, yeasts, such as the genus Saccharomyces, cyanobacteria, ciliates, algae or protozoans such as dinoflagellates, such as Crypthecodinium. Preferred organisms are those which are naturally capable of synthesizing substantial amounts of oil, such as fungi, such as Mortierella alpine, Pythium insidiosum, or plants such as soybean, oilseed rape, coconut, oil palm, safflower, flax, hemp, castor-oil plant, Calendula, peanut, cacao bean or sunflower, or yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with soybean, flax, oilseed rape, safflower, sunflower, Calendula, Mortierella or Saccharomyces cerevisiae being especially preferred. In principle, suitable host organisms are, in addition to the abovementioned transgenic organisms, also transgenic animals, advantageously nonhuman animals, for example C. elegans.\n\nFurther utilizable host cells are detailed in: Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology:\n\nMethods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1990).\n\nExpression strains which can be used, for example those with a lower protease activity, are described in: Gottesman, S., Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, California (1990) 119-128.\n\nThese include plant cells and certain tissues, organs and parts of plants in all their phenotypic forms such as anthers, fibers, root hairs, stalks, embryos, calli, cotyledons, petioles, harvested material, plant tissue, reproductive tissue and cell cultures which are derived from the actual transgenic plant and/or can be used for giving rise to the transgenic plant.\n\nTransgenic plants which comprise the polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesized in the process according to the invention can advantageously be marketed directly without there being any need for the oils, lipids or fatty acids synthesized to be isolated. Plants for the process according to the invention are listed as meaning intact plants and all plant parts, plant organs or plant parts such as leaf, stem, seeds, root, tubers, anthers, fibers, root hairs, stalks, embryos, calli, cotyledons, petioles, harvested material, plant tissue, reproductive tissue and cell cultures which are derived from the transgenic plant and/or can be used for giving rise to the transgenic plant. In this context, the seed comprises all parts of the seed such as the seed coats, epidermal cells, seed cells, endosperm or embryonic tissue. However, the compounds produced in the process according to the invention can also be isolated from the organisms, advantageously plants, in the form of their oils, fat, lipids and/or free fatty acids.\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids produced by this process can be 'obtained by harvesting the organisms, either from the crop in which they grow, or from the field. This can be done via pressing or extraction of the plant parts, preferably the plant seeds. In this context, the oils, fats, lipids and/or free fatty acids can be obtained by what is known as cold-beating or cold-pressing without applying heat by pressing. To allow for greater ease of disruption of the plant parts, specifically the seeds, they are previously comminuted, steamed or roasted. The seeds which have been pretreated in this manner can subsequently be 5 pressed or extracted with solvents such as warm hexane. The solvent is subsequently removed again. In the case of microorganisms, the latter are, after harvesting, for example extracted directly without further processing steps or else, after disruption, extracted via various methods with which the skilled worker is familiar. In this manner, more than 96% of the compounds produced in the process can be isolated.\n\nThereafter, 10 the resulting products are processed further, i.e. refined. In this process, substances such as the plant mucilages and suspended matter are first removed. What is known as desliming can be effected enzymatically or, for example, chemico-physically by addition of acid such as phosphoric acid. Thereafter, the free fatty acids are removed by treatment with a base, for example sodium hydroxide solution. The resulting product\n\n15 is washed thoroughly with water to remove the alkali remaining in the product and then dried. To remove the pigments remaining in the product, the products are subjected to bleaching, for example using fuller's earth or active charcoal. At the end, the product is deodorized, for example using steam.\n\nThe PUFAs or LCPUFAs produced by this process are preferably C18-, C20-, C22-or C24-fatty acid molecules with at least two double bonds in the fatty acid molecule, preferably three, four, five or six double bonds. These C18-, C20-, C22- or C24-fatty acid molecules can be isolated from the organism in the form of an oil, a lipid or a free fatty acid. Suitable organisms are, for example, those mentioned above. Preferred organisms are transgenic plants.\n\nOne embodiment of the invention is therefore oils, lipids or fatty acids or fractions thereof which have been produced by the above-described process, especially preferably oil, lipid or a fatty acid composition comprising PUFAs and being derived from transgenic plants.\n\nA further embodiment according to the invention is the use of the oil, lipid, the fatty acids and/or the fatty acid composition in feedstuffs, foodstuffs, cosmetics or pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe term \"oil\", \"lipid\" or \"fat\" is understood as meaning a fatty acid mixture comprising unsaturated or saturated, preferably esterified, fatty acid(s). The oil, lipid or fat is preferably high in polyunsaturated free or, advantageously, esterified fatty acid(s), in particular linoleic acid, y-linolenic acid, dihomo-y-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, a-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid. The content of unsaturated esterified fatty acids preferably amounts to approximately 30%, a content of 50% is more preferred, a content of 60%, 70%, 80% or more is even more preferred. For the analysis, the fatty acid content can, for example, be determined by gas chromato-graphy after converting the fatty acids into the methyl esters by transesterification. The\n\n16 oil, lipid or fat can comprise various other saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, for example calendulic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and the like. The content of the various fatty acids in the oil or fat can vary in particular, depending on the starting organism.\n\nThe polyunsaturated fatty acids with advantageously at least two double bonds which are produced in the process are, as described above, for example sphingolipids, phosphoglycerides, lipids, glycolipids, phospholipids, monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol or other fatty acid esters.\n\nStarting from the polyunsaturated fatty acids with advantageously at least two double bonds, which acids have been prepared in the process according to the invention, the polyunsaturated fatty acids which are present can be liberated for example via treatment with alkali, for example aqueous KOH or NaOH, or acid hydrolysis, advantageously in the presence of an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or via enzymatic cleavage, and isolated via, for example, phase separation and subsequent acidification via, for example, H2SO4. The fatty acids can also be liberated directly without the above-described processing step.\n\nAfter their introduction into an organism, advantageously a plant cell or plant, the nucleic acids used in the process can either be present on a separate plasmid or integrated into the genome of the host cell. In the case of integration into the genome, integration can be random or else be effected by recombination such that the native gene is replaced by the copy introduced, whereby the production of the desired compound by the cell is modulated, or by the use of a gene in trans, so that the gene is linked functionally with a functional expression unit which comprises at least one sequence which ensures the expression of a gene and at least one sequence which ensures the polyadenylation of a functionally transcribed gene. The nucleic acids are advantageously introduced into the organisms via multiexpression cassettes or constructs for multiparallel expression, advantageously into the plants for the multiparallel seed-specific expression of genes.\n\nMosses and algae are the only known plant systems which produce substantial amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (ARA) and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Mosses comprise PUFAs in membrane lipids, while algae, organisms which are related to algae and a few fungi also accumulate substantial amounts of PUFAs in the triacylglycerol fraction.\n\nThis is why nucleic acid molecules are suitable which are isolated from such strains which also accumulate PUFAs in the triacylglycerol fraction, particularly advantageously for the process according to the invention and thus for the modification of the lipid and PUFA production system in a host, in particular plants such as oil crop plants, for example oilseed rape, canola, linseed, hemp, soybeans, sunflowers and borage. They can therefore be used advantageously in the process according to the invention.\n\n17 Substrates of the nucleic acids used in the process according to the invention which code for polypeptides with lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity, and/or of the further nucleic acids used, such as the nucleic acids which code for polypeptides of the fatty acid metabolism or lipid metabolism selected from the group consisting of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase(s), acyl-ACP[= acyl carrier protein] desaturase(s), acylÂ¨ACP thioesterase(s), fatty acid acyltransferase(s), acyl-Coklysophospholipid acyltransferase(s), fatty acid synthase(s), fatty acid hydroxylase(s), acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase(s), acyl coenzyme A oxidase(s), fatty acid desaturase(s), fatty acid acetylenase(s), lipoxygenase(s), triacylglycerol lipase(s), allene oxide synthase(s), hydroperoxide lyase(s) or fatty acid elongase(s) which are advantageously suitable are C16-, C15-, C20-or C22-fatty acids. The fatty acids converted in the process in the form of substrates are preferably converted in the form of their acyl-CoA esters.\n\nTo produce the long-chain PUFAs according to the invention, the polyunsaturated C16-or C18-fatty acids must first be desaturated by the enzymatic activity of a desaturase and subsequently be elongated by at least two carbon atoms via an elongase.\n\nAfter one elongation cycle, this enzyme activity gives C18- or C20-fatty acids and after two or three elongation cycles C22- or C24-fatty acids. The activity of the desaturases and elongases used in the process according to the invention preferably leads to C18-, Car, C22- and/or C24-fatty acids, advantageously with at least two double bonds in the fatty acid molecule, preferably with three, four or five double bonds, especially preferably to give Car and/or C22-fatty acids with at least two double bonds in the fatty acid molecule, preferably with three, four or five double bonds in the molecule. After a first desaturation and the elongation have taken place, further desaturation steps such as, for example, one in the A5 position may take place. Products of the process according to the invention which are especially preferred are dihomo-y-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid. The GIB-fatty acids with at least two double bonds in the fatty acid can be elongated by the enzymatic activity according to the invention in the form of the free fatty acid or in the form of the esters, such as phospholipids, glycolipids, sphingolipids, phosphoglycerides, monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol or triacylglycerol.\n\nThe preferred biosynthesis site of fatty acids, oils, lipids or fats in the plants which are advantageously used is, for example, in general the seed or cell strata of the seed, so that seed-specific expression of the nucleic acids used in the process makes sense.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that the biosynthesis of fatty acids, oils or lipids need not be limited to the seed tissue, but can also take place in a tissue-specific manner in all the other parts of the plant, for example in epidermal cells or in the tubers.\n\nIf microorganisms such as yeasts, such as Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces, fungi such as Mortierella, Aspergillus, Phytophtora, Entomophthora, Mucor or Thraustochytrium, algae such as lsochrysis, Phaeodactylum or Crypthecodinium are used as organisms in the process according to the invention, these organisms are\n\n18 advantageously grown in fermentation cultures.\n\nOwing to the use of the nucleic acids according to the invention which code for a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, the polyunsaturated fatty acids produced in the process can be increased by at least 5%, preferably by at least 10%, especially preferably by at least 20%, very especially preferably by at least 50% in comparison with the wild type of the organisms which do not comprise the nucleic acids recombinantly.\n\nIn principle, the polyunsaturated fatty acids produced by the process according to the invention in the organisms used in the process can be increased in two different ways.\n\nAdvantageously, the pool of free polyunsaturated fatty acids and/or the content of the esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids produced via the process can be enlarged.\n\nAdvantageously, the pool of esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids in the transgenic organisms is enlarged by the process according to the invention.\n\nIf microorganisms are used as organisms in the process according to the invention, they are grown or cultured in the manner with which the skilled worker is familiar, depending on the host organism. As a rule, microorganisms are grown in a liquid medium comprising a carbon source, usually in the form of sugars, a nitrogen source, usually in the form of organic nitrogen sources such as yeast extract or salts such as ammonium sulfate, trace elements such as salts of iron, manganese and magnesium and, if appropriate, vitamins, at temperatures of between 0 C and 100 C, preferably between 10 C and 60 C, while gassing in oxygen. The pH of the liquid medium can either be kept constant, that is to say regulated during the culturing period, or not. The cultures can be grown batchwise, semibatchwise or continuously. Nutrients can be provided at the beginning of the fermentation or fed in semicontinuously or continuously. The polyunsaturated fatty acids produced can be isolated from the organisms as described above by processes known to the skilled worker, for example by extraction, distillation, crystallization, if appropriate precipitation with salt, and/or chromatography. To this end, the organisms can advantageously be disrupted beforehand.\n\nIf the host organisms are microorganisms, the process according to the invention is advantageously carried out a: a temperature of between 0 C and 95 C, preferably between 10 C and 85 C, especially preferably between 15 C and 75 C, very especially preferably between 15 C and 45 C.\n\nIn this process, the pH value !s advantageously kept between pH 4 and 12, preferably between pH 6 and 9, especially preferably between pH 7 and 8.\n\nThe process according to the invention can be operated batchwise, semibatchwise or continuously. An overview of known cultivation methods can be found in the textbook by Chmiel (Bioprozefltechnik 1. Einfuhrung in die Bioverfahrenstechnik [Bioprocess technology 1. Introduction to Bioprocess technology] (Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart,\n\n19 1991)) or in the textbook by Storhas (Bioreaktoren und periphere Einrichtungen [Bioreactors and peripheral equipment] (Vieweg Verlag, Brunswick/Wiesbaden, 1994)).\n\nThe culture medium to be used must suitably meet the requirements of the strains in question. Descriptions of culture media for various microorganisms can be found in the textbook \"Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology\" of the American Society for Bacteriology (Washington D.C., USA, 1981).\n\nAs described above, these media which can be employed in accordance with the invention usually comprise one or more carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts, vitamins and/or trace elements.\n\nPreferred carbon sources are sugars, such as mono-, di- or polysaccharides.\n\nExamples of very good carbon sources are glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, ribose, sorbose, ribulose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, raffinose, starch or cellulose.\n\nSugars can also be added to the media via complex compounds such as molasses or other by-products from sugar refining. The addition of mixtures of a variety of carbon sources may also be advantageous. Other possible carbon sources are oils and fats such as, for example, soya oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil and/or coconut fat, fatty acids such as, for example, palmitic acid, stearic acid and/or linoleic acid, alcohols and/or polyalcohols such as, for example, glycerol, methanol and/or ethanol, and/or organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid and/or lactic acid.\n\nNitrogen sources are usually organic or inorganic nitrogen compounds or materials comprising these compounds. Examples of nitrogen sources comprise ammonia in liquid or gaseous form or ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate or ammonium nitrate, nitrates, urea, amino acids or complex nitrogen sources such as cornsteep liquor, soya meal, soya protein, yeast extract, meat extract and others. The nitrogen sources can be used individually or as a mixture.\n\nInorganic salt compounds which may be present in the media comprise the chloride, phosphorus and sulfate salts of calcium, magnesium, sodium, cobalt, molybdenum, potassium, manganese, zinc, copper and iron.\n\nInorganic sulfur-containing compounds such as, for example, sulfates, sulfites, dithionites, tetrathionates, thiosulfates, sulfides, or else organic sulfur compounds such as mercaptans and thiols may be used as sources of sulfur for the production of sulfur-containing fine chemicals, in particular of methionine.\n\nPhosphoric acid, potassium dihydrogenphosphate or dipotassium hydrogenphosphate or the corresponding sodium-containing salts may be used as sources of phosphorus.\n\nChelating agents may be added to the medium in order to keep the metal ions in solution. Particularly suitable chelating agents comprise dihydroxyphenols such as catechol or protocatechuate and organic acids such as citric acid.\n\nThe fermentation media used according to the invention for culturing microorganisms usually also comprise other growth factors such as vitamins or growth promoters, which include, for example, biotin, riboflavin, thiamine, folic acid, nicotinic acid, panthothenate and pyridoxine. Growth factors and salts are frequently derived from 5 complex media components such as yeast extract, molasses, cornsteep liquor and the like. It is moreover possible to add suitable precursors to the culture medium. The exact composition of the media compounds heavily depends on the particular experiment and is decided upon individually for each specific case.\n\nInformation on the optimization of media can be found in the textbook \"Applied Microbiol.\n\nPhysiology, A\n\n10 Practical Approach\" (Editors P.M. Rhodes, P.F. Stanbury, IRL Press (1997) pp. 53-73, ISBN 0 19 963577 3). Growth media can also be obtained from commercial suppliers, for example Standard 1 (Merck) or BHI (brain heart infusion, DIFC0) and the like.\n\nAll media components are sterilized, either by heat (20 min at 1.5 bar and 121 C) or by filter sterilization. The components may be sterilized either together or, if required, 15 separately. All media components may be present at the start of the cultivation or added continuously or batchwise, as desired.\n\nThe culture temperature is normally between 15 C and 45 C, preferably at from to 40 C, and may be kept constant or may be altered during the experiment. The pH of the medium should be in the range from 5 to 8.5, preferably around 7Ã The pH\n\nfor\n\n20 cultivation can be controlled during cultivation by adding basic compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia and aqueous ammonia or acidic compounds such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid. Foaming can be controlled by employing antifoams such as, for example, fatty acid polyglycol esters. To maintain the stability of plasmids it is possible to add to the medium suitable substances having a selective effect, for example antibiotics. Aerobic conditions are maintained by introducing oxygen or oxygen-containing gas mixtures such as, for example, ambient air into the culture. The temperature of the culture is normally 20 C to 45 C\n\nand preferably 25 C to 40 C. The culture is continued until formation of the desired product is at a maximum. This aim is normally achieved within 10 to 160 hours.\n\nThe fermentation broths obtained in this way, in particular those comprising polyunsaturated fatty acids, usually contain a dry mass of from 7.5 to 25% by weight.\n\nThe fermentation broth can then be processed further. The biomass may, according to requirement, be removed completely or partially from the fermentation broth by separation methods such as, for example, centrifugation, filtration, decanting or a combination of these methods or be left completely in said broth. It is advantageous to process the biomass after its separation.\n\nHowever, the fermentation broth can also be thickened or concentrated without separating the cells, using known methods such as, for example, with the aid of a rotary evaporator, thin-film evaporator, falling-film evaporator, by reverse osmosis or by nanofiltration. Finally, this concentrated fermentation broth can be processed to obtain the fatty acids present therein.\n\n21 The fatty acids obtained in the process are also suitable as starting material for the chemical synthesis of further products of interest. For example, they can be used in combination with one another or alone for the preparation of pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, animal feeds or cosmetics.\n\nThe invention furthermore relates to isolated nucleic acid sequences coding for polypeptides having lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity, wherein the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases, diacylglycerol acyltransferases and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferases encoded by the nucleic acid sequences specifically convert Cu-, C20-, C22- or C24-fatty acids with at least one double bonds in the fatty acid molecule and advantageously ultimately incorporate these into diacylglycerides and/or triacylglycerides.\n\nAdvantageous isolated nucleic acid sequences are sequences selected from the group consisting of:\n\na) a nucleic acid sequence with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ\n\nID\n\nNO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 18 or SEQ

sequence shown in SEQ\n\nID NO: 2, sqc) ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ\n\nID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 19 or SEQ ID NO: 21 and which have at least 40% homology at the amino acid level with SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 19 or SEQ ID NO: 21 and have lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity.\n\nFurther advantageous isolated nucleic acid sequences according to the invention are sequences selected from the group consisting of:\n\na) a nucleic acid sequence with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ\n\nID\n\nNO: 24 or SEQ ID NO: 26,\n\n22 b) nucleic acid sequences which, as the result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, can be derived from the coding

glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity.\n\nAdditional advantageous isolated nucleic acid sequences according to the invention are sequences selected from the group consisting of:\n\na) a nucleic acid sequence with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 30 or SEQ ID NO: 32, b) nucleic acid sequences which, as the result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, can be derived from the coding sequence in SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID NO:\n\n30 or SEQ ID NO: 32, c) derivatives of the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID\n\nNO:\n\n30 or SEQ ID NO: 32, which code for polypeptides with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID NO: 31 or SEQ ID NO: 33 and have at least 40% homology at the amino acid level with SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID NO: 31 or SEQ ID NO: 33 and which have diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity.\n\nA further group of advantageous isolated nucleic acid sequences according to the invention are sequences selected from the group consisting of:\n\na) a nucleic acid sequence with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 34 or SEQ ID\n\nNO: 36, b) nucleic acid sequences which, as the result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, can be derived from the coding sequence in SEQ ID NO: 34 or SEQ ID\n\nNO: 36, c) derivatives of the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 34 or SEQ ID\n\nNO: 36, which code for polypeptides with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 35 or SEQ ID NO: 37 and which have at least 40% homology at the amino acid level with SEQ ID NO: 35 or SEQ ID NO: 37 and have lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity.\n\nWith the aid of these isolated nucleic acids according to the invention, LCPUFAs can be incorporated, in LCPUFA-producing organisms, at all positions of, for example, a triacylglycerol, as indicated by the position analyses of the lipids from LCPUFA-producing organisms.\n\n23 The abovementioned isolated nucleic acid sequences according to the invention can advantageously be combined with the following nucleic acid sequences, which code for polypeptides with acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity, selected from the group consisting of:\n\na) a nucleic acid sequence with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 39, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 43 or SEQ ID NO: 45, b) nucleic acid sequences which can be derived from the coding sequence present in SEQ ID NO: 39, SEQ ID NO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 43 or SEQ ID NO: 45 as the result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, c) derivatives of the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 39, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 43 or SEQ ID NO: 45, which code for polypeptides with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 40, SEQ ID NO: 42, SEQ ID NO: 44 or SEQ ID NO: 46 and which have at least 40% homology at the amino acid level with SEQ ID NO: 40, SEQ ID NO: 42, SEQ ID NO: 44 or SEQ ID NO: 46 and which have an acyl-CoMysophospholipid acyltransferase activity.\n\nAll of the nucleic acid sequences used in the process according to the invention are advantageously derived from a eukaryotic organism.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequences used in the process which code for proteins with lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity or for proteins of the fatty acid or lipid metabolism, advantageously for proteins with acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-4-desaturase, A-5-desaturase, A-6-desaturase, A-8-desaturase, A-9-desaturase, A-12-desaturase, A-5-elongase, elongase or Li-9-elongase activity are, advantageously alone or preferably in combination, introduced in an expression cassette (= nucleic acid construct) which makes possible the expression of the nucleic acids in an organism, advantageously a plant or a microorganism.\n\nTo introduce the nucleic acids used in the process, the latter are advantageously amplified and ligated in the known manner. Preferably, a procedure following the protocol for Pfu DNA polymerase or a Pfu/Taq DNA polymerase mixture is followed.\n\nThe primers are selected taking into consideration the sequence to be amplified. The primers should expediently be chosen in such a way that the amplificate comprises the entire codogenic sequence from the start codon to the stop codon. After the = amplification, the amplificate is expediently analyzed. For example, a gel-electro-phoretic separation can be carried out with regards to quality and quantity.\n\nThereafter, the amplificate can be purified following a standard protocol (for example Qiagen). An aliquot of the purified amplificate is then available for the subsequent cloning step.\n\n= Suitable cloning vectors are generally known to the skilled worker. These include, in = particular, vectors which are capable of replication in microbial systems, that is to say =\n\nmainly vectors which ensure efficient cloning in yeasts or fungi and which make\n\n24 possible the stable transformation of plants. Those which must be mentioned in particular are various binary and cointegrated vector systems which are suitable for the T-DNA-mediated transformation. Such vector systems are, as a rule, characterized in that they comprise at least the vir genes required for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and the T-DNA-delimiting sequences (T-DNA border). These vector systems preferably also comprise further cis-regulatory regions such as promoters and terminators and/or selection markers, by means of which suitably transformed organisms can be identified. While in the case of cointegrated vector systems vir genes and T-DNA sequences are arranged on the same vector, binary systems are based on at least two vectors, one of which bears vir genes, but no T-DNA, while a second one bears T-DNA, but no vir gene. Owing to this fact, the last-mentioned vectors are relatively small, easy to manipulate and to replicate both in E. coli and in Agrobacterium. These binary vectors include vectors from the series pBIB-HYG, pPZP, pBecks, pGreen. In accordance with the invention, Bin19, pB1101, pBinAR, pGPTV\n\nand pCAMBIA are used by preference. An overview of binary vectors and their use is found in Hellens et al., Trends in Plant Science (2000) 5, 446-451. In order to prepare the vectors, the vectors can first be linearized with restriction endonuclease(s) and then modified enzymatically in a suitable manner. Thereafter, the vector is purified, and an aliquot is employed for the cloning step. In the cloning step, the enzymatically cleaved and, if appropriate, purified amplificate is cloned using vector fragments which have been prepared in a similar manner, using ligase. In this context, a particular nucleic acid construct, or vector or plasmid construct, can have one or else more than one codogenic gene segment. The codogenic gene segments in these constructs are preferably linked functionally with regulatory sequences. The regulatory sequences include, in particular, plant sequences such as the above-described promoters and terminators. The constructs can advantageously be stably propagated in microorganisms, in particular in Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, under selective conditions and make possible the transfer of heterologous DNA into plants or microorganisms.\n\n=\n\nThe nucleic acids used in the process, the inventive nucleic acids and nucleic acid constructs, can be introduced into organisms such as microorganisms or advantageously plants, advantageously using cloning vectors, and thus be used in the transformation of plants such as those which are published and cited in: Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida), Chapter 6/7, pp. 71-119 (1993); F.F. White, Vectors for Gene Transfer in Higher Plants; in:\n\nTransgenic Plants, Vol. 1, Engineering and Utilization, Ed.: Kung and R. Wu, Academic Press, 1993, 15-38; B. Jenes et al., Techniques for Gene Transfer, in:\n\nTransgenic Plants, Vol. 1, Engineering and Utilization, Ed.: Kung and R. Wu, Academic Press (1993), 128-143; Potrykus, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Molec. Biol. 42 (1991), 205-225. Thus, the nucleic acids, the inventive nucleic acids and nucleic acid constructs, and/or vectors used in the process can be used for the recombinant modification of a broad spectrum of organisms, advantageously plants, so that the latter become better and/or more efficient PUFA producers.\n\nA series of mechanisms exists by which the modification of a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase protein according to the invention can influence directly the yield, production and/or production efficiency of a fine chemical from an oil 5 crop plant or a microorganism, owing to a modified protein. The number or activity of the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase protein or gene and also of gene combinations of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases, desaturases and/or elongases for example may have increased, so that greater 10 amounts of the compounds produced are produced de novo, since the organisms lacked this activity and ability to biosynthesize prior to introduction of the corresponding gene(s). This applies analogously to the combination with further desaturases or elongases or further enzymes of the fatty acid and lipid metabolism. The use of various divergent sequences, i.e. sequences which differ at the DNA sequence level, may also 15 be advantageous in this context, or else the use of promoters for gene expression which makes possible a different gene expression in the course of time, for example as a function of the degree of maturity of a seed or an oil-storing tissue.\n\nOwing to the introduction of a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, lecithin cholesterol 20 acyltransferase, acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, desaturase and/or elongase gene or more lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, desaturase and/or elongase genes into an organism, alone or in combination with other genes in a cell, it is not only possible to\n\n25 increase biosynthesis flux towards the end product, but also to increase, or to create de novo, the corresponding triacylglycerol composition. Likewise, the number or activity of other genes which are involved in the import of nutrients which are required for the biosynthesis of one or more fine chemicals (e.g. fatty acids, polar and neutral lipids), can be increased, so that the concentration of these precursors, cofactors or intermediates within the cells or within the storage compartment is increased, whereby the ability of the cells to produce PUFAs as described below is enhanced further. Fatty acids and lipids are themselves desirable as fine chemicals; by optimizing the activity or increasing the number of one or more lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, desaturase and/or elongase genes which are involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds, or by destroying the activity of one or more genes which are involved in the degradation of these compounds, an enhanced yield, production and/or efficiency of production of fatty acid and lipid molecules from organisms, advantageously from plants, is made possible.\n\nThe isolated nucleic acid molecules used in the process according to the invention code for proteins or parts of these, where the proteins or the individual protein or parts thereof comprise(s) an amino acid sequence with sufficient homology to an amino acid\n\n26 sequence of the sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO:\n\n10, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 27, SEQ ID NO: 29, 5EQ ID NO: 31, SEQ ID NO: 33, SEQ ID NO: 35 or SEQ ID NO: 37, so that the protein or part thereof have a and retains an equivalent lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity. The protein or part thereof which is encoded by the nucleic acid molecule preferably retains its essential enzymatic activity and the ability to participate in the metabolism of compounds required for the synthesis of cell membranes or lipid bodies in organisms, advantageously in plants, or in the transport of molecules across these membranes. Advantageously, the protein encoded by the nucleic acid molecules is at least approximately 40%, preferably at least approximately 60% and more preferably at least approximately 70%, 80% or 90% and most preferably at least approximately 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous to an amino acid sequence of the sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 27, SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 31, SEQ ID NO: 33, SEQ ID NO: 35 or SEQ ID NO: 37. For the purposes of the invention homology or homologous are to be understood as meaning identity or identical.\n\nEssential enzymatic activity of the inventive lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases, diacylglycerol acyltransferases or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferases used is understood as meaning that they retain at least an enzymatic activity of at least 10%, preferably 20%, especially preferably 30%\n\nand very especially 40% in comparison with the proteins/enzymes encoded by the sequence with SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ\n\nID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 28, SEQ ID NO: 30, SEQ ID NO: 32, SEQ ID NO: 34 or SEQ ID NO: 36 and their derivatives and can thus participate in the metabolism of compounds required for the synthesis of fatty acids, fatty acid esters such as diacylglycerides and/or triacylglycerides in an organism, advantageously a plant cell, or in the transport of molecules across membranes, meaning desaturated C18-, C20-, C22- or C24-carbon chains in the fatty acid molecule with double bonds at at least two, advantageously three, four or five positions.\n\nNucleic acids which can advantageously be used in the process are derived from bacteria, fungi or plants such as algae or mosses, such as the genera Shewanella, Physcomitrella, Thraustochytrium, Fusarium, Phytophtora, Ceratodon, Isochrysis, Aleurita, Muscarioides, Mortierella, Borago, Phaeodactylum, Crypthecodinium or from nematodes such as Caenorhabditis, specifically from the genera and species Shewanella hanedai, Physcomitrella patens, Phytophtora infestans, Fusarium graminaeum, Cryptocodinium cohnii, Ceratodon purpureus, Isochrysis galbana, = Aleurita farinosa, Muscarioides viallii, Mortierella alpine, Borago officinalis,\n\n27 Phaeodactylum tricornutum, or especially advantageously from Caenorhabditis elegans.\n\nAlternatively, the isolated nucleotide sequences used may code for lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases, diacylglycerol acyltransferases or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferases which hybridize with a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ\n\nID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID NO: 30, SEQ ID NO: 32, SEQ ID NO: 34 or SEQ ID\n\nNO: 36, for example under stringent conditions.\n\nThe nucleic acid sequences used in the process are advantageously introduced into an expression cassette which makes possible the expression of the nucleic acids in organisms such as microorganisms or plants.\n\nIn doing so, the nucleic acid sequences which code for the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases, diacylglycerol acyltransferases or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferases of the invention, and the nucleic acid sequences which code for the acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases used in combination, the desaturases and/or the elongases are linked functionally with one or more regulatory signals, advantageously for enhancing gene expression.\n\nThese regulatory sequences are intended to make possible the specific expression of the genes and proteins. Depending on the host organism, this may mean, for example, that the gene is expressed and/or overexpressed only after induction has taken place, or else that it expresses and/or overexpresses immediately. For example, these regulatory sequences take the form of sequences to which inductors or repressors bind, thus controlling the expression of the nucleic acid. In addition to these novel regulatory sequences, or instead of these sequences, the natural regulation of these sequences may still be present before the actual structural genes and, if appropriate, may have been genetically modified in such a way that natural regulation has been eliminated and expression of the genes has been enhanced. However, the expression cassette (= expression construct = gene construct) can also be simpler in construction, that is to say no additional regulatory signals have been inserted before the nucleic acid sequence or its derivatives, and the natural promoter together with its regulation has not been removed. Instead, the natural regulatory sequence has been mutated in such a way that regulation no longer takes place and/or gene expression is enhanced.\n\nThese modified promoters can also be positioned on their own before the natural gene in the form of part-sequences (= promoter with parts of the nucleic acid sequences of the invention) in order to enhance the activity. Moreover, the gene construct may advantageously also comprise one or more of what are known as enhancer sequences in functional linkage with the promoter, which make possible an enhanced expression of the nucleic acid sequence. Additional advantageous sequences, such as further regulatory elements or terminators, may also be inserted at the 3' end of the DNA\n\nsequences. The lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate\n\n28 acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase genes and the advantageously used acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-desaturase, A5-desaturase, A-6-desaturase and/or A-8-desaturase 9enes and/or A-elongase, A-6-elongase and/or A-9-elongase genes may be present in one or more copies in the expression cassette (= gene construct). Preferably, only one copy of the genes is present in each expression cassette. This gene construct or the gene constructs can be expressed together in the host organism. In this context, the gene construct(s) can be inserted in one or more vectors and be present in the cell in free form, or else be inserted in the genome. It is advantageous for the insertion of further genes in the host genome when the genes to be expressed are present together in one gene construct.\n\nIn this context, the regulatory sequences or factors can, as described above, preferably have a positive effect on the gene expression of the genes introduced, thus enhancing it. Thus, an enhancement of the regulatory elements, advantageously at the transcriptional level, may take place by using strong transcription signals such as promoters and/or enhancers. In addition, however, enhanced translation is also possible, for example by improving the stability of the mRNA.\n\nA further embodiment of the invention is one or more gene constructs which comprise one or more sequences which are defined by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID NO: 30, SEQ ID NO: 32, SEQ ID NO: 34 or SEQ ID NO: 36 or its derivatives and which code for polypeptides as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 27, SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID NO: 31, SEQ ID\n\nNO: 33, SEQ ID NO: 35 or SEQ ID NO: 37. The abovementioned lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases, diacylglycerol acyltransferases or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferases lead advantageously to an exchange or incorporation of fatty acids between the mono-, di- and/or triglyceride pool of the cell and the CoA-fatty acid ester pool, the substrate advantageously having one, two, three, four or five double bonds and advantageously 18, 20, 22 or 24 carbon atoms in the fatty acid molecule. The same applies to their homologs, derivatives or analogs, which are linked functionally with one or more regulatory signals, advantageously for enhancing gene expression.\n\nAdvantageous regulatory sequences for the novel process are present for example in promoters such as the cos, tac, trp, tet, trp-tet, Ipp, lac, Ipp-lac, laclq, T7, T5, T3, gal, trc, ara, SP6, A-PR or A-PL promoter and are advantageously employed in Gram-negative bacteria. Further advantageous regulatory sequences are, for example, present in the Gram-positive promoters amy and SP02, in the yeast or fungal promoters ADC1, MFa, AC, P-60, CYC1, GAPDH, TEF, rp28, ADH or in the plant promoters CaMV/35S [Franck et al., Cell 21(1980) 285-294], PRP1 [Ward et al., Plant.\n\n29 Mol. Biol. 22 (1993)], SSU, OCS, lib4, usp, STLS1, B33, nos or in the ubiquitin or phaseolin promoter. Advantageous in this context are also inducible promoters, such as the promoters described in EP-A-0 388 186 (benzylsulfonamide-inducible), Plant J.\n\n2, 1992:397-404 (Gatz et al., tetracycline-inducible), EPÂ¨A-0 335 528 (abscisic acid-inducible) or WO 93/21334 (ethanol- or cyclohexenol-inducible). Further suitable plant promoters are the cytosolic FBPase promoter or the ST-LSI promoter of potato (Stockhaus et at., EMBO J. 8, 1989, 2445), the glycine max phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate amidotransferase promoter (Genbank Accession No. U87999) or the node-specific promoter described in EPÂ¨A-0 249 676. Especially advantageous promoters are promoters which make possible the expression in tissues which are involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Very especially advantageous are seed-specific promoters, such as the USP promoter as described, but also other promoters such as the LeB4, DC3, phaseolin or napin promoter. Further especially advantageous promoters are seed-specific promoters which can be used for monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous plants and which are described in US 5,608,152 (oilseed rape napin promoter), WO 98/45461 (Arabidopsis oleosin promoter), US 5,504,200 (Phaseolus vulgaris phaseolin promoter), WO 91/13980 (Brassica Bce4 promoter), by Baeumlein et al., Plant J., 2, 2, 1992:233-239 (LeB4 promoter from a legume), these promoters being suitable for dicots. Examples of promoters which are suitable for monocots are the barley lpt-2 or lpt-1 promoter (WO 95/15389 and WO 95/23230), the barley hordein promoter and other suitable promoters described in WO 99/16890.\n\nIn principle, it is possible to use all natural promoters together with their regulatory sequences, such as those mentioned above, for the novel process. It is also possible and advantageous to use synthetic promoters, either in addition or alone, in particular when they mediate seed-specific expression, such as those described in WO 99/16890.\n\nIn order to achieve a particularly high PUFA content, especially in transgenic plants, the PUFA biosynthesis genes should advantageously be expressed in oil crops in a seed-specific manner. To this end, seed-specific promoters can be used, or those promoters which are active in the embryo and/or in the endosperm. In principle, seed-specific promoters can be isolated both from dicotyledonous and from monocotyledonous plants. Advantageous preferred promoters are listed hereinbelow:\n\nUSP (= unknown seed protein) and vicilin (Vicia faba) [Baumlein et at., Mol.\n\nGen Genet., 1991, 225(3)1, napin (oilseed rape) [US 5,608,152], acyl carrier protein (oilseed rape) [US 5,315,001 and WO 92/18634], oleosin (Arabidopsis thaliana) [WO 98/45461 and WO 93/20216], phaseolin (Phaseolus vulgaris) [US 5,504,200], Bce4 [WO 91/13980], legumes B4 (LegB4 promoter) [Baumlein et al., Plant J., 2,2, 1992], Lpt2 and Ipt1 (barley) [WO 95/15389 and WO 95/23230], seed-specific promoters from rice, maize and wheat [WO 99/16890], Amy32b, Amy 6-6 and aleurain [US 5,677,474], Bce4 (oilseed rape) [US 5,530,149], glycinin (soybean) [EP 571 741], phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase (soybean) [JP 06/62870], ADR12-2 (soybean) [WO 98/08962], isocitrate lyase (oilseed rape) [US 5,689,040] or a-amylase (barley) [EP 781 849].\n\nPlant gene expression can also be facilitated via a chemically inducible promoter (see review in Gatz 1997, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 48:89-108).\n\nChemically inducible promoters are particularly suitable when it is desired that gene expression should take place in a time-specific manner. Examples of such promoters are a 5 salicylic-acid-inducible promoter (WO 95/19443), a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Gatz et al. (1992) Plant J. 2, 397-404) and an ethanol-inducible promoter.\n\nTo ensure the stable integration of the biosynthesis genes into the transgenic plant over a plurality of generations, each of the nucleic acids which code for lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, 10 diacylglycerol acyltransferase and/or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, the advantageous acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, A-4-desaturase, A-5-desaturase, A-6-desaturase, A-8-desaturase and/or A-5-elongase, A-6-elongase and/or A-9-elongase and which are used in the process should be expressed under the control of a separate promoter, preferably a promoter which differs from the other promoters, 15 since repeating sequence motifs can lead to instabili"
