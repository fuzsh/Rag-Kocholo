        "text": "SHANGHAI, Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dingdong (Cayman) Limited (\"Dingdong\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: DDL), a leading fresh grocery e-commerce company in China, with advanced supply chain capabilities, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n\nGMV for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 16.8% year over year to RMB6,218.7 million (US$855.7 million) from RMB5,322.4 million in the same quarter of 2023. In June, we saw remarkable growth, with the same stores' GMV increasing by 21.6% year over year, and all regions experienced positive year-over-year growth in scale.\n\nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 1268.6% year over year to RMB103.1 million (US$14.2 million), the seventh consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability, compared with non-GAAP net income of RMB7.5 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB67.1 million (US$9.2 million), compared with net loss of RMB36.6 million in the same quarter of 2023. Both non-GAAP and GAAP net income this quarter made record highs for the past 12 months.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB245.7 million (US$33.8 million), the fourth consecutive quarter of net operating cash inflow.\n\nMr. Changlin Liang, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Dingdong, stated, \"As of the second quarter of 2024, Dingdong has achieved profitability for seven consecutive quarters based on non-GAAP standards. Additionally, after the first quarter of this year, the company has again achieved GAAP profitability. Notably, we have resumed growth since the first quarter of this year. Both profits and revenue have shown positive year-over-year growth for two consecutive quarters. These achievements are mainly attributed to Dingdong's world-leading fresh grocery supply chain capabilities, which facilitate our continued growth in scale and profits. Considering our improved performance in the second quarter and our expectations for further growth, we have raised our forecasts for profitability and scale. We anticipate a significant year-over-year increase in net profit and scale for both the year as a whole and the third quarter, and are confident that we will achieve both non-GAAP and GAAP profitability.\"\n\nMr. Song Wang, Chief Financial Officer of Dingdong, stated, \"In the second quarter of 2024, Dingdong generated revenue of RMB5.6 billion, up 15.7% compared to the previous year. Non-GAAP net profit margin was 1.8%, a 1.6 percentage point increase from the previous year, with a net profit of RMB103 million, nearly a 13-fold increase from the previous year. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. The Company was profitable under the GAAP standards for a second consecutive quarter with net profit margin of 1.2%, up by 2.0 percentage points year-over-year, and net profit of RMB67.13 million, an increase of RMB103.73 million year over year. At the end of the second quarter, our balance of cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted funds, and short-term investments amounted to RMB4.16 billion. We are continuously improving the efficiency of capital use and our financing structure. The actual balance of our own funds, which is the cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments deducted the balance of short-term borrowings, was RMB2.32 billion. In the second quarter, we achieved outstanding financial performance in line with our guidance. Considering our recent operating financial performance and balance sheet strength, we are confident we will meet our performance expectations for the third quarter and the whole year.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nTotal revenues were RMB5,599.0 million (US$770.4 million) compared with total revenues of RMB4,840.6 million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily attributed to the increased numbers of transacting users and frequency of monthly purchases and resumed expanding our station network in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai this year, leading to a higher revenue.\n\nProduct Revenues were RMB5,517.9 million (US$759.3 million) compared with product revenues of RMB4,778.7 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nService Revenues were RMB81.1 million (US$11.2 million) compared with service revenues of RMB61.9 million in the same quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the increase of customers subscribing to Dingdong's membership program.\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses were RMB5,612.8 million (US$772.3 million) compared with RMB4,866.9 million in the same quarter of 2023, with a detailed breakdown as below:\n\nCost of goods sold was RMB3,919.4 million (US$539.3 million), an increase of 17.3% from RMB3,340.3 million in the same quarter of 2023.

The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges and do not correlate to any operating activity trends. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company's results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of industry peers and may not be comparable with their non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this announcement.\n\nExchange Rate Information\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.2672 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on June 28, 2024 set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
