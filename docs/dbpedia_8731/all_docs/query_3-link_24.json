This period is called the Viking Age.\n\nIn the 9th century, new seafaring routes are discovered. Sailing ships make it possible to reach worlds, far away from familiar shores. At seafaring’s nodal points, complex new cultures, towns, networks and communities emerge - and trading thrives. Voyages connect coasts the world over and bring together people of different ideas, beliefs and traditions. One can safely say that 9th century seafaring transforms the world. On the map below you can see the seafaring routes which connected coats and people in the Viking Age."
