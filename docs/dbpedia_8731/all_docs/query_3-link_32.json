        "text": "Scandinavia is a term used for the area shared by Norway, Sweden and the part of Northern Finland. This shifts the focus solely on Norway and Sweden whenever one refers to Scandinavian countries.\n\n'Scandinavian' relation with Norsemen of early middle ages\n\nThe use of the word 'Skandinavien' is common in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish languages because that word refers to the ancient territories of the Norsemen: Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Faroe Island and Iceland were the part of the Norsemen territory as well.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTerritories of the Norsemen is the most accepted way of recognising the Scandinavian countries.\n\nWhen Iceland belonged to Norway and Denmark, Finland was a part of the kingdom of Sweden.\n\nNot only did they share the same history, but the political and economic platforms were the same for these five countries as well. These countries also share a similar model known as the Nordic welfare state since the 20th century.\n\nClearing the confusion between Scandinavian and Nordic countries\n\nAt the time of these overlying linguistic and geographical confusions in identifying what Scandinavian countries are, the French came to the rescue. They invented the term 'Pays Nordiques' or 'Nordic Countries'.\n\nThis has become a common term to bring together Scandinavia, Iceland, and Finland under the same umbrella to be flagged as Nordic countries.\n\nOther beliefs behind 'Nordic'\n\n'Nordic' is a term derived from the local Scandinavian-language word 'Norden' which in literal terms means, the northern islands. However, the residents are called as 'Norbdo' which in literal term means, \"northern dwellers\".\n\nNordic countries include Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Faroe Islands (an archipelago of islands as an autonomous country within the kingdom of Denmark).\n\nThese countries share similar flags, languages, and many cultural traits.\n\nThey are also the least corrupt in the world and have a low crime rate.\n\nThey have the world's most high-rated gender equality ratio and world's highest proportion of women in senior leadership position.\n\nIn the current scenario, while the term 'Scandinavia' is commonly used for Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the term \"Nordic countries\" is vaguely used for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, including their associated territories of Greenland, the Faroe Islands and the land Islands.\n\nHowever, both Svalbard and Greenland are classified as separate from both Scandinavia and the Nordics.\n\nHistory of the\n\nThe Nordic countries were among the last parts of Eurasia to be settled by humans.\n\nThe 8th to the 11th centuries are known as the Viking Age.\n\nViking is not the name of a tribe or nation, but the Old Norse word for 'sailor'. Most people from the territory of Norse were farmers who remained in Scandinavia and were by definition not Vikings, but some Norsemen.\n\nThese Norsemen sailed through the stretch of Atlantic and the European rivers. They are also known to have taken part in the foundation of the nations like England, Russia and France.\n\nWith due time, the Norsemen held a bad reputation across Europe. They were known for their barbarism as their expedition from peaceful trade turned into pirate raids.\n\nThe Norse nations were unified by 1000 AD.\n\nSweden annexed Finland in the 13th century. Sweden proving rebellious fought eleven wars against Denmark over a period of 300 years. The idea of Scandanavian unity was revived in the 19th century.\n\nScandinavian history is properly known after the introduction of Christianity. In 829 AD, Denmark was the first of those countries to embrace Christianity.\n\nErik, the heir of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, implemented a political unity of a period of 123 years that acknowledged Denmark as the political capital of Scandinavia.\n\nThis union was broken with the establishment of independent Swedish monarch in a revolt led by Gustavus Vasa.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNorway remained affiliated with Denmark and remained so until 1814 after the Swedish revolt. In this manner, the historical monarchies of Denmark and Norway were established on one side, and Sweden and Finland on the other.\n\nFinland was a colony of Russia since 1845 and got independence in 1918 due to weakened condition of Russia after World War 1.\n\nNorway's independence in 1905 was set off from Denmark after 400 years of domination.\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
