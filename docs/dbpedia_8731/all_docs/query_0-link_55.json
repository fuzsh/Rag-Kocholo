        "text": "From daycare to primary schools: An emphasis on social skills\n\nDanish children begin public daycare as early as 9 months, and by age 3 98 % of children in Denmark are attending public kindergartens. Staffed by professionals with training in early childhood education, these institutions teach basic academic concepts like letters and numbers, as well as social rules like taking turns and helping others. Most of the day is spent on \"free play\" and activities outdoors.\n\nAt age 6, Danish children begin their formal schooling. The educational approach in Denmark avoids class rankings and formal tests; instead, children work in groups and are taught to challenge the established way of doing things. Teachers are called by their first names. The emphasis is on problem-solving, not memorisation.\n\nAll children in Denmark have access to tuition-free government folkeskole (people's school) until they are 16 years old. Some parents choose private schools because they are smaller, or because they have a particular educational approach.\n\nOthers choose private schools for religious reasons: Denmark is home to Jewish, Christian, and Muslim schools. English-language international schools and French and German-language schools are also available on a paid-for basis. All schools are required to follow the national government's basic requirements for primary education.\n\nChoosing a secondary education: Academic or trade school?\n\nNear the end of their time in primary school, Danish children take a nationwide test to help them choose the next step in their education.\n\nPupils with strong academic abilities often select a gymnasium for their secondary education, where they can focus on languages, sciences, math or similar subjects to prepare them for university.\n\nMore practically-oriented pupils often prefer a trade school that can train them in high-paying skills like metalworking, electrical technology, or mechanics, or a business school where they can learn about accounting or software development.\n\nOther pupils delay the decision for a year, choosing an efterskole (after school) where they live away from home and study topics of interest like theatre or sports alongside their academic requirements.\n\nUniversities and \"getting paid to go to school\"\n\nOnce they have completed their secondary education, Danes can choose from a variety of tertiary options, including a standard university that grants bachelors, masters', and PhD degrees; a university college that awards bachelors degrees in hands-on subjects such as social work; or a public arts and architecture academy, like The Royal Academy of Music.\n\nFull-time students in Denmark are eligible for Statens Uddannelsest√∏tte, or SU (limited income support) from the government alongside other work they do to help pay their expenses while studying.\n\nIt is common for Danes to begin working in their future job roles while they are still in the process of education, either as a paid praktikant (intern) or apprentice.\n\nLifelong learning for fun and profit\n\nEducation in Denmark does not stop with graduation; at any given time, one out of three Danish adults age 25-64 is taking some kind of continuing education course.\n\nMany Danish workplaces pay for their employees' additional training, and there are also public and private providers of classes that help build business and professional skills. Unemployed people in Denmark are often required to take courses that will prepare them to return to the job market.\n\nDenmark's public and private investment in the development of new qualifications and skills is one of the highest in Europe. The idea is to maintain a highly-qualified and well-educated workforce that can succeed in a global knowledge economy.\n\nOf course, not all education is for professional reasons. Many adults in Denmark take classes in cooking, painting, foreign languages, music, or dance just for fun. A lot of these classes are publicly funded and offered for a minimal fee."
