        "text": "THIS IS a story about how the unique landscapes, climates and geography of Scandinavia played a key role in shaping Scandinavian society and create the conditions for success.\n\nA central character in this story is water. Water is at the heart of human civilization. We need it to drink, water our plants, transport goods on ships and was our first source of inanimate power (water wheels).\n\nDespite the crucial role water plays in shaping human civilization it is rarely talked about. Instead you will hear famous sociologists such as Max Weber talk about Protestant work ethic, others like geographer Jared Diamond talks about how plants and domesticated animals spread.\n\nLet me give you an idea of why water is so important: Shipping a sack of sugar from Havana, Cuba across the Atlantic by ship to Oslo, Norway in the 1800s was cheaper than sending that same sack of sugar a mere 50 kilometers from Oslo to Eidsvold by horse and carriage.\n\nHere is another example: Until 1820 the British industrial revolution was almost entirely driven by waterwheels. Most people today are unaware of this fact. They think the industrial revolution was all about steam engines. Yes, steam engines arose during the industrial revolution, but most of the factories were in fact powered by waterwheels.\n\nRead more: Why England Industrialized First.\n\nThat Manchester became the manufacturing hub of Great Britain was no accident. The surrounding area had numerous rivers with enough fall to support hundreds of waterwheels powering a great variety of mills and factories.\n\nBut water does not shape societies in the same manner. One might go as far as to say that water can be autocratic or democratic. Okay, that sounds corny. What I mean is that the way water is accessible and used in different societies will tend to push societies either towards a hierarchical autocratic power structure or a more egalitarian and democratic power structure. Outcomes depend on things like scarcity of water. Does society have too little water or is there too much and there is a great need for drainage systems?\n\nTo understand how water shaped Scandinavian history and development, I want to have something to contrast Scandinavia with. Thus I will begin by talking about ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Sumer, China, Indus and Persia. These civilizations arose very early and have cultures which are almost the complete opposite of Scandinavian culture. While Scandinavian societies tend to be egalitarian and democratic, the countries which served as the birth places of the first great civilizations tend to have deeply hierarchical and autocratic power structures.\n\nSocial psychologist Geert Hofsted has developed a cultural dimension theory, which is used to rate different cultural traits. One of these is the power distance index, which says something about how strong power hierarchies are in different cultures. You can see how the classic river based civilizations have high scores for hierarchy (around 80) while Nordic countries are below 40.\n\nNote: I am using Arab countries instead of Egypt and Iraq in this measurement because Egypt and Iraq has no data for hierarchy.\n\nHow Rivers Built the First Great Civilizations\n\nIn areas such as Egypt, Mesopotamia (current Iraq), Indus valley (present day India) and China civilizations grew up along vast rivers such as the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Yangtze\n\nThese vast river systems would flood the river banks and deposit silt which would act as fertilizer. The hot climates allowed for multiple harvests through the year. This combination gave very rich harvests and made it possible to create population dense civilizations since large amounts of food could be produced within a small area. The rivers themselves gave opportunities to transport goods.\n\nHere are some important things to note about water access in these areas. It rarely rains so the river is crucial in accessing water. However, rivers are not exactly playing along with humans. They flood huge areas. Humans had to tame these rivers with complex systems of canals and dams.\n\nThat way water could be led to areas where it was needed while avoiding that it flooded cities or other settlements. Water could be kept in storage to water lands over longer period of time. Water could be led further away from the river to expand agricultural areas.\n\nManaging all of this required a lot of planning, labor and central administration. This gave rise to powerful centralized states. Egypt, Sumer had God-like rulers. The Emperors of China were also almost likened to Gods. Their power was immense.\n\nWater management was a key reason for this immense power. These rulers basically held a gun to the head of every farmer. Should the farmers not play ball, they would not get their needed share of water from the centralized irrigation, canal and dam system that had been built up.\n\nWhenever China collapsed into multiple states, food production dropped like a stone. The reason was simple: Maintaining all the complex network of canals required vast amounts of coordination and manpower over a large area. Such work could only be done by a large state.\n\nFor this reason China would through history never stay divided for long. There would always be an immense pressure to re-unite China into one empire, as this always meant a dramatically improved agricultural production.\n\nQanat and Aqueduct Civilizations\n\nAll ancient civilizations were not built around huge rivers. Persia, Ancient Rome and Greece was not built around major rivers.\n\nHowever all these civilizations existed in areas with a lot of mountains. These civilizations built systems to carry water from the mountains down to the agricultural areas.\n\nAquifers are create storage of water underground. However you should not think of these as some kind of large caves with water inside. Instead they are much like oil reservoirs except they hold water. At the bottom you have an impermeable rock formation which traps the water. Above you have porous rocks such as sandstone which contains numerous small empty spaces which allows water to be stored.\n\nPersians developed a sort of underground aqueduct called qanat which would transfer water from mountain aquifers to agricultural areas. Qanats evolved from mining operations. Anyone doing mining will discover major problems with water underground. The Persians figured out they could dig tunnels to lead the water from these mines down to the lowlands and water their farm fields.\n\nBy digging shafts at regular intervals they could get access to the underground and dig the tunnels for many kilometers. Because the water is running underground you avoid water evaporation which would be a big problem in hot areas like Persia.\n\nIran since ancient times is riddled with Qanats. Reading up about this I am a bit surprised that they are not as well known as Aqueducts because they have been used all over the world. The technique spread to Moorish Spain. Both Teheran and Madrid did until modern times get all their water from Qanats.\n\nThey also ended up getting used in Italy as well as in ancient Greece. While they seem similar to Aqueducts the key difference is that Qanats are dug deep under ground and source water from an Aquifer in the mountains. Aqueducts are laid in pipes in shallow ground or above ground on top of great arches. They source their water from rivers or lakes in the mountains.\n\nBoth of these systems require large groups of people to work together and coordinate their actions. Thus while qanat and aqueducts are not rivers they still lead to similar need for centralized government and control. Another way of looking at it is that government can more easily control water access when this is how you get water as opposed to from rain from the sky.\n\nBut why live in areas which requires this complex water management? A benefit is that in these hot climates you can grow a greater variety of crops and harvest multiple times per year. Until the development of the heavy plow which could be used to deal with the heavier soil in Northern Europe, these hotter areas gave significant advantage in terms of agricultural output.\n\nRainfall Civilizations\n\nGo further north and you get to lands where there is enough rain to water the crops. Complex engineering and water management systems are not needed. That applies to countries such as Germany, France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Baltics, Ukraine, Russia and the Nordic countries.\n\nIn fact northern countries would often face the opposite problem: Too much water. Farmers would have to spend a lot of effort to build drainage ditches. The Netherlands is a rather extreme example. Because the Netherlands is below sea level, the ground is very close to the water table. The result is that managing agriculture in the Netherlands is a constant challenge of drainage.\n\nThere is a joke about how God created the world but the Dutch created Netherlands. It derives from that fact that so much of the Netherlands is land reclaimed from the sea. They would build dikes out in the sea. Once and artificial lake is created they would drain it using windmills driving pumping systems. However draining these polders is a constant activity.\n\nThe Dutch call the area below sea-level which is surrounded by dikes a polder. A polder could be large enough to hold several towns. Political power within this context developed opposite of what we found in the great river civilizations and those based on qanats and aqueducts. An army or a powerful ruler could hold a gun to the head of every farmer by blocking the water flow.\n\nA polder is the opposite. Everybody must maintain the dike they live next to or everybody dies from flooding. It is a bit like the cold war concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD).\n\nIt is a like everybody holding a gun to the head of everybody else. The only way to deal with such as situation is mutual respect and cooperation. That is how the Dutch waterboards arose. People from the whole area covered by a waterboard would elect representatives which would implement policies related to water management which all towns within the waterboard area. Waterboards served as the model for the development of Dutch democracy.\n\nThus unlike China and Egypt, water management in the Netherlands pushed for the development of Democracy rather than Autocracy.\n\nThe Netherlands is of course a rather unique case, so I will shift my attention to Denmark and Germany.\n\nCoastal and River Based Trade Networks\n\nBoth Denmark and Germany have easy access to water from rainfall. Neither country has to manage large networks of dikes, so why did Denmark develop in a more egalitarian and democratic direction than Germany?\n\nIt is worth asking because Germany and Scandinavian countries share many cultural traits. Scandinavian traditions for how to organize bureaucracy education draws a lot of inspiration from Northern German states.\n\nA key difference is how trade was conducted. The map below shows Denmark before 1645. Notice how much coastline there is relative to the landmass of Denmark. That implies that a large fraction of the Danish population had easy access to the sea and could uses it to transport goods to other parts of Denmark.\n\nIn Germany in contrast transportation of goods and people would be done along rivers such as Rhine, Elbe and Danube. Now it should be pointed out that Northern Germany has a very extensive network of waterways. The rivers help explain who Germany managed to develop so well. Rivers allow for more goods to be transported cheaply, which allows higher volume production and specialization.\n\nSo Denmark and Germany are fundamentally different in how water facilitates transportation. Denmark is well suited for ocean based transportation while Germany has very little coastline relative to its total landmass. Instead Germany has a lot of rivers.\n\nA well known feature of the German landscapes are the numerous castles built along the rivers. With these castles the local lords could control commercial trade and traffic. Controlling ocean based trade by setting up castles does not work well. People can easily sail around those spots.\n\nThus the German aristocracy could control trade in a way Danish aristocrats and local rulers could not. Thus a more free and independent peasantry evolved in Denmark. They could more easily trade with each other without some kind of centralized power manipulating or controlling this trade.\n\nA related condition developed in Norway. While the landmass of Norway is not split into multiple islands like Denmark, it has large number of fjords which gives Norway the longest coastline in Europe. That means a large fraction of the Norwegian population is also close to the ocean similar to Denmark. In addition Norway is mountainous with may rivers and streams. Historically these got used to float timber down to fjords so they could be loaded on ships and exported.\n\nFlat vs Mountainous Terrain\n\nIn Norway it is the combination of mountains, forests and fjords which makes centralized control difficult. If you spread out people over a large area with difficult terrain, you cannot control them as easily as when they are concentrated in smaller flat area. For this reason in the Danish-Norwegian union Norwegian farmers actually had the most freedom and the lowest taxes.\n\nIn countries with flat terrain you tend to see the formation of authoritarian states. I have talked about Egypt and Mesopotamia as places where the water management systems contributed to centralized control.\n\nLooking only at water management one would have assume that places like Russia should have developed into democracies given that Russia farmers get easy access to water through rain rather than complex water management systems.\n\nHowever, large flat terrain makes it easy for large armies to move around, while making it hard defenders to protect themselves. Especially large plains without forests, hills or mountains cannot protect itself easily against powerful armies.\n\nThe Mongol conquests represent a good example of this. The large grass plains allowed their cavalry to cover large distances and conquer vast swats of land. If you look world maps you will see how mountainous regions tend to form separate countries such as Switzerland, Norway and Greece. Large flat plains tend to form large countries as natural borders donâ€™t form across a plain.\n\nEurope itself is a patchwork of states due to irregular coastlines, mountain ranges and rivers going in a variety of directions. Usually mountain ranges go in one direction. However Europe has been squeezed between several continental plates causing mountain ranges to go in different directions.\n\nThe Pyrenees create a natural boundary between Spain and France. Especially since the coastline is such that the land area narrows there. The Alps form a naturally boundary between Italy and the rest of Europe. The Rhein in combination with the Alps form a boundary between France and Germany.\n\nDevelopment of a Maritime Culture and Its Implication\n\nTo become a seafaring nation you need areas to practice. Greece could develop seafaring early because it has numerous islands and an irregular coastline. Being able to sail was thus clearly beneficial and you could accomplish getting to different places without too much difficulty.\n\nThe classic work by Homer, the Odyssey, gives a hint at the role seafaring played in early Greek history.\n\nGreece is different from other ancient civilization in that it was not really based on bountiful agricultural production evolved from major river systems. Instead Greek power and prosperity was built on seafaring.\n\nRemember my examples with how much cheaper sea based transportation is? Rivers are definitely useful but seafaring ships can more easily exploit strong winds and are thus better suited for transporting large amounts of cargo.\n\nSay you were a God and had a lump of land you wanted to shape. How would you arrange the landmass to facilitate as much goods transport as possible? If you rolled the land into a blob or a circle, you would minimize trade. However if you split the land into numerous islands which are close to each other, you dramatically increase potential for trade. In effect you would have created Greece.\n\nGreece could thus specialize on production of specialized good rather than aim for full self-sufficiency which is not always optimal. Greece used its land to produce olive oil and wine which it would export to get grain and meat from Egypt, Sicily, Carthage and other civilizations.\n\nA very similar situation occurred in other seafaring nations such Norway and the Netherlands. Dutch soil is often too wet to support grain production. For this reason the Netherlands could historically not feed itself very well. They relied on imports of large amounts of grain from e.g. the Baltic countries.\n\nTo import, you need to have cash from exports to pay for it. The Dutch solution for the Dutch was to focus on cows and sheep. The wet soil was suitable for grass production, so they could raise cows and sheep. But there is one problem: Milk from cows doesnâ€™t last very long and is thus not suited for exports. The Dutch solution was to specialize on Cheese production.\n\nEven today Cheese has a very special role in Dutch society. You can find big historical cheese markets in historical towns like Gouda.\n\nWhat about Norway? Norway has such poor climate and such rocky soil that it simply was not well suited for large scale agricultural production of any kind. Only 2.5% of Norwegian land is suited for agricultural production. We can contrast that with Denmark where 70% of the land is suited for agriculture.\n\nNorway like Greece and the Netherlands could not feed itself, but unlike the former countries it could not export specialized agricultural products to import grain. However Norway has vast forests, mountains and fjords. This makes a unique combination possible: Nearly all European countries needed wood in great quantities to build ships, furniture, fuel, support beams, floors etc. Norway ended up supplying much of this wood. If you walk into an old British pub, then the floors and counters are with 80% certainty made from Norwegian wood.\n\nBut why Norway? Sweden, Finland and Russia all have much larger forests? In all economic development resources is often the smallest problem. Transportation is the key problem. The fjords gave access to the interior of Norways great forests. Timber could be floated down mountain streams.\n\nNorwegian waterfalls gave another advantage: You could build sawmills powered by waterwheels to cut timber into planks. That was a major labour saving opportunity which made Norwegian lumber export far more valuable. Without as many waterfalls Sweden, Finland and Russia could not as easily process timber. Nor did they have fjords and fast flowing rivers to the extent which could help float the timber to harbors.\n\nThe lumber exports gave Norway the profits to import grain it was in short supply of. Denmark was in an opposite situation. It was a grain exporter.\n\nIt is interesting to compare Norway and Denmark with Russia and Ukraine. Russia has a lot of forest like Norway. Ukraine has rich agricultural lands like Denmark. Yet Norway and Denmark ended up far more developed. Why?\n\nThe key difference is that both Norway and Denmark had conditions which allowed ocean based exports and imports. Norway because of fjords and Denmark because of all the irregular shaped islands and peninsula of Jutland. Sea based trade does not just benefit an economy directly but it also is of significant importance for technological and social development.\n\nWith extensive trade and travel between numerous other European countries, Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Denmark could pickup ideas from other countries. For instance Norway traded a lot with the Netherlands. Dutch experts would come to Norway and help design better machinery for operating the water wheel driven saws. Norway traded extensively with both the Netherlands and Great Britain two of the most technological and economically developed countries in Europe. Reading Norwegian history one can see how various engineers and other experts from these countries would assist in development of different industries, machinery and practices.\n\nOne can contrast with Japan which also has a lot of mountains and waterfalls. They never developed advanced water powered saws in the 1800s. While the reasons are complex, one key factor is that Japan did not have easy access to industrialized countries to learn how to do it.\n\nRussia is closer to Europe, but Russia has very little coastline and no major rivers allowing transport into the heart of Western Europe. That means communications with Russia is limited and thus Russia ended up far behind the rest of Europe in social, economical and technological development.\n\nThe strongest indication of how much this held Russia and Ukraine back is the effect of railroad building. In the 1860s railroad started expanding in both countries which allowed timber from the vast Russian interior to be delivered to Europe. It also allowed the transportation of large amounts of grain from Russia and Ukraine. Previously large number of horses had to be used for transportation. It may not be obvious to people today but these horses consumed a lot of agricultural output. With railroad a lot fewer horses were needed and they could be used to help plow the fields thus increasing agricultural output.\n\nThe 1870s saw a collapse in grain prices thanks to railroads in Russia, Ukraine, the US and elsewhere making transportation of grain much cheaper. Norway also suffered economically because the railroad made Russian timber available in larger quantities.\n\nThe reason I am pointing this out is to hammer home that Russia, Ukraine and the US had vast resources, but inability to transport these resources effectively to market held back their economic utility. That is another way to say that before railroads arrived water based transportation was everything. Any country with access to effective water based transportation would have an edge.\n\nIt is no accident that the more technological and scientifically developed countries in history have often been seafaring nations. Why is that? An important thing to understand about science and technology is that most discoveries at any given time will happen outside of your town, even outside of your country. Technological and scientific development is as much about importing ideas of others as it is about inventing your own ideas. A trading nation has the advantage of being able to more easily pick up ideas from other towns and even other countries. By being a hub for trade you become also a hub for exchange of ideas. A seafaring nation can thus adopt ideas of others and expand on them.\n\nGreece also had another trick up their sleeve. The difficult terrain and jagged coastline meant that Greece was for a long time not united. Instead the Greek world was made up of numerous city states. This arrangement gave Greece a petri-dish for social and political experimentation. While Sparta was a dictatorship, Athens was a democracy. A free thinker in one city could run away to another if he became unpopular.\n\nSeveral great European thinkers lived in border regions so they could flee to another country if their ideas became too unpopular with the local ruler or the church.\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that the Italian Renaissance began when Italy was divided into multiple city states with different types of rule just like Greece in classical times.\n\nScandinavia is not known as a center of scientific and technological development like classical Greece or renaissance Italy. But it is worth keeping in mind that in terms of population Scandinavia was very small. The Greek world in classical times was a lot bigger than I think people today are aware of. 500 BC Greece has larger population than Egypt.\n\nRead more: When Greece Had a Larger Population Than Africa and Japan Combined.\n\nThus for Scandinavia to be a key driver of innovation in the 1800s would have been odd. The population was too small. However, Scandinavian countries were rapid adopters of technology and still are. Also its is not quite true that Scandinavia was not innovative. It has often been remarked on that the number of Swedish inventors and what they made in the 1800s was quite remarkable given that Sweden at the time was mainly agrarian.\n\nHow Climate Shaped Scandinavian Society\n\nMaritime traditions are not exclusive to Scandinavia. We have to add another piece to complete the puzzle: The cold climate.\n\nTo get through the winter one has to develop extensive storage economies to store food and fuel through the winter. Communal institutions developed to facilitate this storage.\n\nThus collectivism developed in Scandinavia during the Feudal era long before communism and socialism arose as political movements. For instance in Denmark farms were often run as cooperatives. A village would hold land in common and rotate and organize who would work what plot of land as population rose or declined. This cooperative and collectivist culture has carried on until modern times.\n\nOne of the reasons Denmark was so successful in developing and using wind turbines was that they evolved within a collectivist framework. Local cooperatives built wind turbines, which mean that locals could all share in the profits and benefits of building wind turbine as oppose to a for-profit company and their shareholders.\n\nNorway industrialized with hydro-electric power in much the same manner. The building of hydro-electric power plants and railroad was often a cooperative approach. The government, municipality and locals would all work together to build hydropower plants as well as railroad track. Thus locals were direct beneficiaries of industrial expansion.\n\nThe same applies to how Scandinavia built phone lines more rapidly than anybody else. A key reason behind this was the cooperative approach where local communities took responsibility for doing it rather than for-profit companies.\n\nThis pattern was quite unique and different from for instance great Britain where for-profit companies built all the railroad track and telegraph lines.\n\nThe Role of Lutheranism In Development of Scandinavian Collectivism\n\nClimate and geography was not the only thing causing Scandinavian collectivism to develop. Another lesser known factor is Lutheranism. German sociologist and economist Max Weber is famous for coining the term protestant work ethic.\n\nWhat Weber talked about was how Protestantism created the foundation for a very individualistic and capitalist society. However, there is a flaw in this story. What Weber talks about is actually not all Protestantism but Calvinism. Calvinism as opposed to Lutheranism is what pushes a very capitalist-like individualist ideology. Calvinism is the flavor of Protestantism dominating the United States. Lutheranism is what Scandinavian countries adopted and it emphasizes collectivism and common good more that Calvinism.\n\nPutting it All Together\n\nWe have covered a lot of different elements which all contributed to producing the unique aspects of Nordic societies. Let me try to summarize the different factors:\n\nCoastline and geography favoring sea based trade: lots of fjords (Norway) or many islands (Denmark).\n\nSea based trade and transportation as opposed to river based transportation. River based trade tends to centralize power more than ocean based trade.\n\nInflux of ideas regarding politics, technology and science due to extensive trade with far away lands.\n\nProximity to highly advanced countries like Britain, Netherlands and Germany. Scandinavians would send people to these countries to study and learn latest science and technology as well as invite skilled craftsmen from these countries.\n\nGeography making centralized control hard. Norway and Sweden for instance have spread out populations, mountains, large forests and/or fjords.\n\nWater management does not encourage centralized control as in old civilizations such as Egypt and China.\n\nClimate and Religion encouraging a collectivist society.\n\nWe can contrast this with other countries which had very different development. Germany in particular had many similarities but the river based trade networks encouraged more centralized and hierarchical power structures.\n\nThen we have Greece which could have developed along similar lines as Scandinavia given its similar type of geography. However Greece had the disadvantage of developing much earlier and thus depleting its resources. Secondly Greece is too close to other major civilizations which meant it could never be left alone. It would get invaded by Romans and later by Ottomans.\n\nRussia has similar climate as Scandinavia but has very little coastline and is mostly flat which discourages extensive trade and encourages strong centralized control and deep power hierarchies.\n\nWhat About Oil?\n\nWhen talking about Scandinavian or Nordic countries the question of oil always pop up, even when it plays no role, so I need to make a few remarks on it. Only Norway is a major oil exporter in the Nordic region. Denmark has oil but it only makes up 0.4% of Danish GDP. It is also important to note that Scandinavian oil production began very late. Norway did not produce oil until 1971, while the US had produced since 1859 and Saudi Arabia since 1938. Russia began even earlier in 1846. Thus when talking about Scandinavian historical development oil does not play an important role. The typical characteristics of Scandinavian society developed much earlier.\n\nA more interesting country with respect to resource driven development: No, Capitalism Did Not Make America the Richest Country.\n\nFor the curious: How Norway Got Rich Against All Odds Before Oil.\n\nRelated Stories"
