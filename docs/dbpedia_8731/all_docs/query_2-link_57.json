        "text": "Hej! Velkommen! Välkommen! Greetings from the enchanting world of Scandinavia! If you’re thinking about embarking on a journey to learn a Scandinavian language, you’re in for an adventure that combines linguistic richness with the allure of Nordic culture. Scandinavia is more than just meatballs, fjords, and a certain Swedish furniture giant. It is a region with a rich history, vibrant arts and culture, and stunning natural beauty.\n\nBut the question remains: Which Scandinavian language should you choose? There are three main Scandinavian languages – Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish. Each language has its own unique charm and nuances.\n\nIn this article, we’ll help you explore the different Scandinavian languages and choose the one that’s right for you. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of each language and be ready to begin your Scandinavian language learning journey.\n\nWhat are the Scandinavian languages?\n\nThe Scandinavian languages are a group of North Germanic languages spoken in Northern Europe. The main Scandinavian languages are Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Icelandic, Faroese, Gutnish, and Elfdalian are also considered to be Scandinavian languages, although they are more distantly related to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish.\n\nScandinavian languages have a number of similarities. They all share a common vocabulary and grammar, and they are all relatively easy for speakers of other Germanic languages – such as English, German, and Dutch – to learn.\n\nHowever, there are also some important differences between the Scandinavian languages. For example, Danish and Norwegian are more closely related to each other than they are to Swedish. Icelandic is the most distantly related of the Scandinavian languages, and it has retained many features of Old Norse that have been lost in the other Scandinavian languages.\n\nHow similar are the Scandinavian languages?\n\nThe Scandinavian languages are very similar to each other, both in terms of vocabulary and grammar. This is because they all developed from Old Norse, a language that was spoken in Scandinavia a long time ago during the Viking Age.\n\nDanish, Norwegian, and Swedish are the most similar of the Scandinavian languages, and they are mutually intelligible to a large extent. This means that speakers of one of these languages can generally understand the other two languages without much difficulty.\n\nThe most similar among the Scandinavian languages are Danish and Norwegian, and here is a great video which illustrates that. The similarities most likely come from their shared history, when Norway was part of a union with Denmark. During that time, the Danish language and culture was predominant in Norway.\n\nHere is a table to illustrate how mutually intelligible the Scandinavian languages are.\n\nTotal numbers of L1 and L2 speakers of each language\n\nAs of 2023, there are about 21.5 million people who speak Scandinavian languages. Swedish is the largest of them all, with 10 million L1 (native language) speakers. Danish and Norwegian have around 6 million and 4.32 million native speakers, respectively.\n\nThe total number of L2 (second language) speakers of Scandinavian languages is difficult to estimate, as there is no reliable data available. It’s estimated, however, that Swedish has about 3 million L2 speakers. This might come from the fact that Sweden has the largest population out of all the Scandinavian countries. This makes it easier to find Swedish language resources and to find people with whom to practice Swedish. Sweden is also a relatively wealthy country with a high standard of living, making it an attractive destination for immigrants and students, who may want to learn Swedish in order to live and work in Sweden.\n\nThe status of English in the Scandinavian countries\n\nEnglish is widely spoken in the Scandinavian countries, and they rank among the top countries for English proficiency among non-native English-speaking countries. That’s because compared to English, all of the Scandinavian languages are relatively small, and knowing English gives you an advantage in many areas of life.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t study these languages. Studying a language helps you to communicate with the locals, whether you just want to travel there or move there for work. Additionally, it shows appreciation for the language and culture, even if you’re able to communicate only on the most basic level. This shows that you’re at least making an effort to understand the language.\n\nKnowledge of Scandinavian languages in neighboring countries\n\nIceland\n\nDanish is usually one of the compulsory languages for schoolchildren in Iceland, although this doesn’t necessarily mean that Icelanders speak Danish or any other Scandinavian language all that well.\n\nFinland\n\nFinland is a Nordic country that has two official languages: Finnish and Swedish. Finnish is part of the Finno-Ugric language family, so it’s not related to any Scandinavian languages. Swedish is the native language of 5.2% and is taught in Finnish schools. Despite that, not many Finns actually speak Swedish.\n\nThe Baltic countries\n\nOf the three Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia have the closest ties to Sweden, since both countries were ruled by Sweden at one point. Estonia has a Swedish-speaking minority group called Estonian Swedes (eestirootslased). Most Estonian Swedes used to live in Noarootsi parish (now part of Lääne-Nigula parish), where place names still have both Estonian and Swedish versions. None of the Scandinavian languages are mandatory in school, but you might find people here and there who speak them to some extent.\n\nWhich one should you study?\n\nIf you haven’t figured out whether you should study the melodious and musical-sounding Swedish and Norwegian, or the more throaty Danish, we can help you decide which Scandinavian language is right for you.\n\nThere is no definitive answer to which language you should choose. The best language for you to study will depend on your individual needs and interests. Here are some questions to consider when making your decision.\n\nWhich culture are you most interested in? Sweden, Denmark, and Norway have all their unique cultures and landscapes. Denmark is known for its hygge culture, Norway for its stunning fjords and mountains, and Sweden for its innovative spirit and design. You should pick the language depending on which country’s culture you’re most interested in.\n\nWhich language is most useful to you? If you have plans to work in Denmark, then it would be best to learn Danish. If you’d like to travel all around Norway, then you may want to learn Norwegian, which can help you connect with the locals while discovering this beautiful country full of fjords and troll trails. Or, if you want to take advantage of the great study opportunities in Sweden, then Swedish would be a great choice.\n\nWhich language is easiest to learn? If you are a native speaker of English and don’t have a strong preference, then Norwegian is generally considered to be the easiest Scandinavian language for you to begin with, closely followed by Swedish.\n\nConclusion"
