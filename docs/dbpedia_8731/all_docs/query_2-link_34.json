If you are also interested in any PRINTS from any of my posts, be sure to check out my store where you can buy prints as posters, in metal/wooden frames or on canvas.\n\nPeople often confused the terms â€˜Scandinaviaâ€™ with the â€˜Nordicsâ€™. That goes without saying that all Scandinavian countries are also a part of the Nordics, but not all Nordic countries are Scandinavian. Here is the breakdown:\n\nScandinavia: Sweden, Norway, Denmark\n\nNordics: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands\n\nGetting around Scandinavia is quite easy since all three countries are well connected by flight and train transportation. You could ideally plan a month or two long trip to get a good understanding of each country.\n\nI have been lucky enough to live in Sweden for a few years now, so I already have the advantage of living in Scandinavia, allowing me to explore more of it. As such, I have been privileged to see not just the capitals of all these countries (Check out my blog post about the Nordic capitals), but many cities and natural attractions as well.\n\nThis post is broken down by each Scandinavian country, followed by specific places in those countries and my blog posts about each one of them. Therefore, you have a complete breakdown of each place that I have been to and have experience in myself. Feel free to also check out the videos and photos I have posted to get a flavor of what you can expect in these places.\n\nBreak down of each country and the cities/natural attractions I will discuss:\n\nSweden (Jump to section): Stockholm, Gothenburg, MalmÃ¶, Uppsala, Lund, Helsingborg, Kalmar, Ã–land, Marstrand, Visby, FÃ¥rÃ¶, Gotland, Swedish Castles\n\nNorway (Jump to section): Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, TromsÃ¸, Trolltunga, Preikestolen, the Lofoten Islands\n\nDenmark (Jump to section): Aarhus, Odense, Copenhagen\n\nIf you like some of my photos that you have come across, just know that I have many prints showcasing a variety of landscapes, including Scandinavia, available for purchase below! (Sold as Posters, Canvas, or in Metal-Frames and Wooden-Frames).\n\nFeatured\n\nSweden\n\nStockholm, Gothenburg, MalmÃ¶, Uppsala, Lund, Helsingborg, Kalmar, Ã–land, Marstrand, Visby, FÃ¥rÃ¶, Gotland\n\nMy expat journey has taken me from my home in the US, to South Africa, to England, and now to Sweden and I can say that without a doubt, this country is my absolute favorite to live in.\n\nI canâ€™t quite put my finger on what makes Sweden such an attractive place but here are a few things that I have come to learn (and appreciate) about this country:\n\nA strong emphasis on appreciating nature is instilled in every Swede from birth\n\nVirtually all Swedes speak flawless English (among other languages)\n\nSwedes usually keep to themselves but will help you out if you ask for it without hesitation\n\nMidsummer is the most important national holiday, coinciding with the longest day of the year\n\nFika (a coffee break) is an institution; many jobs yield time for a fika or two during the work day\n\nStockholm\n\n(See Blog Post - Why Stockholm is the Best Scandinavian Capital)\n\nWhen compared to other cities in the world, Stockholmâ€™s size by population is humbling (around 2.5 million people in the metropolitan area), and yet each island that make up this 14 island archipelago of a capital, has something unique to offer.\n\nStortorget, RÃ¥dhuset, Stenbock Palaces, The Royal Palace - all great places to see located in the Gamla Stan area\n\nKungstrÃ¤dgÃ¥rden, DjurgÃ¥rden - Wonderful green spaces and good for people watching\n\nABBA, Vasa, and Fotografiska Museums\n\nMonteliusvÃ¤gen, Skinnarviksberget, Erikâ€™s Gondolen, Norra Riddarholmenshamn - great for golden hour and sunsets!\n\nVete-Katten, Kajsas Fisk, Orangeriet, Greasy Spoon, La Neta City, Stampen for food/entertainment\n\nSolna Centrum, Solna Strand, Universitetet, Stadion, Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan - artsy tunnelbana stations\n\nStockholm Tunnelbana\n\n(See Blog Post - The Worldâ€™s Longest Art Gallery: Riding on the Stockholm Tunnelbana)\n\nIt seems quite ununsual that one of the things people suggest you do in Stockholm is to simply ride the metro system. However, you will find that this is particularly the case, not just for this city but a few others in the world as well (Moscow, London, New York). The Tunnelbana in Stockholm is considered the worldâ€™s longest art gallery, as many of the stations themselves feature works from [mostly] swedish artists.\n\nGothenburg\n\n(See Blog Post - A Tour of Gothenburg: Sweden's 2nd Largest City)\n\nGothenburg is Swedenâ€™s 2nd most populous city, located on the west coast of the country and within close proximity to Norway (to the north) and Denmark (to the south). This strategic location makes Gothenburg the largest port in all the Nordic countries. From here, you can take ferries to Germany and Denmark. Considered to be the â€˜biggest little cityâ€™ in Sweden, Gothenburg is easy to navigate (by tram and buses), and offers plenty of attractions to take in as a weekend (or longer) visitor. Furthermore, the archipelago just off the coast provides an excellent escape to those wishing to flee the city noise (more on this below).\n\nGunnebo House, Skansen Kronan historical sites\n\nSeminarieparken, Slottsskogen, Palm House (Horticulture Gardens)\n\nSlottskogsobservatoriet Museum\n\nFeskekÃ¶rka, Stenpiren/Lilla Brommen for good views\n\nHaga/Lejontrappen, RÃ¶da Sten Konsthall, Liseberg\n\nGothenburg Archipelago:\n\nNorth - Vinga, FotÃ¶, HÃ¶nÃ¶, GrÃ¶tÃ¶, Kalvsund, Ã–ckerÃ¶, BjÃ¶rkÃ¶, HÃ¤lsÃ¶, KÃ¤llÃ¶-Knippla, Hyppeln, RÃ¶rÃ¶.\n\nSouth - AsperÃ¶, BrÃ¤nnÃ¶, KÃ¶pstadsÃ¶, VargÃ¶, Stora FÃ¶rÃ¶, Knarrholmen, StyrsÃ¶, DonsÃ¶, KÃ¥rholmen, Sjumansholmen.\n\nMalmÃ¶\n\n(See Blog Post - Take a weekend break in MalmÃ¶, Sweden)\n\nMalmÃ¶ is Swedenâ€™s 3rd largest city (6th largest in Scandinavia), situated in the southern region of SkÃ¥ne. What was once a very industrialized city has now evolved into a biotech and IT hub. Half of the population of the city has a foreign background due to the influx of refugees that Sweden has accepted in recent years. This has turned the city into a melting pot of cultures giving it a different feel than traditional Swedish cities. A weekend trip to MalmÃ¶ is a worthy proposition for those looking to experience a city with many modern conveniences but with cultural and historical entities of Swedenâ€™s storied past.\n\nMalmÃ¶ Castle - originally built by Denmark in 1434.\n\nGamla VÃ¤ster - old charming area in the city center.\n\nSt. Peterâ€™s Church - a brick Gothic church located just Northeast of Gamla VÃ¤ster.\n\nKungsparken and SlottstrÃ¤dgÃ¥rden - both park lie near the MalmÃ¶ City Library and MalmÃ¶ Castle\n\nRibersborgsstranden - beach with a great view of Ã˜resund bridge and access to the Open-air bath.\n\nTurning Torso, Ã˜resund bridge, Lilla Torg, MalmÃ¶ City Library, MalmÃ¶ Lighthouses - cool places\n\nUppsala\n\n(See Blog Post - Uppsala: the hidden gem just North of Stockholm)\n\nMost people who come to Sweden only really know about Stockholm, or maybe even the second largest city of GÃ¶teborg (Gothenburg), but Uppsala usually doesnâ€™t come to mind (Swedenâ€™s fourth largest city). Uppsala is a short 40 minute train ride from Stockholm Central which makes it ideal for a day/weekend trip and is easily walkable. Itâ€™s known as a university town as Uppsala University is the oldest in the country (established in 1477).\n\nLinneanum, Uppsala Castle, Uppsala Cathedral, Gamla Uppsala - historical sites\n\nStadsparken, Engelskaparken, and HÃ¥gadalen-NÃ¥stens Naturreservat\n\nLinneanum Orangery and Tropical Greenhouse - museums\n\nGotlandsparken for great views\n\nLund\n\n(See Blog Post - A Day Tour of the University town of Lund)\n\nLund is one of the two university towns in Sweden (the other being Uppsala). That means it is at its most lively when school is in session. Interestingly enough, its founding dates all the way back to 990 when it was then a part of Denmark (there have been so many wars fought between these Scandinavian neighbors that at one point Denmark ruled everything, and then Sweden did, and then repeat).\n\nLund Cathedral, All Saints Church - historical sites and landmarks\n\nLundagÃ¥rd, Botanical Garden - parks\n\nKulturen - museums\n\nStora Torget - place to see\n\nHelsingborg\n\n(See Blog Post - Just a few reasons to see Helsingborg in the South of Sweden)\n\nHelsingborg is a coastal city in the south of Sweden, otherwise known as SkÃ¥ne. It sits just a few miles away from HelsingÃ¸r, Denmark on the Ã˜resund Strait. It is the 9th largest city in Sweden by population with about 112,000 inhabitants. It is one of the oldest cities in Sweden, as it was first permanently settled in 1085. Itâ€™s strategic position on the coastline was very important to Denmark, because controlling both sides of the Ã˜resund Strait allowed the Danish King to tax transit through it.\n\nKÃ¤rnan, RÃ¥dhuset - historical sites\n\nSlottshagen for parks\n\nÃ–restrandsbadet for good views\n\nHelsingborg Lighthouse and Pilot House, HelsingÃ¸r, Ven are some cool places to see\n\nKalmar\n\n(See Blog Post - Kalmar: The town you should know more about in Sweden)\n\nKalmar is located in the Southeast corner of Sweden and sits on the Baltic Sea. As the 30th largest city in Sweden, you may not understand why there is a draw to go there. This small town is really defined by its collection of 17th and 18th century buildings still standing and for its castle that served it well during the Scanian War. Currently, the city has been instrumental in its drive to remove its dependence on fossil fuels by initiating a variety of reform programs.\n\nKalmar Cathedral, Kalmar Castle, Tripp Trapp Trull historical sites\n\nLaboratorieholmen, Stadspark, SvinÃ¶ for nice parks\n\nKalmar Konstmuseum\n\nKalmar Slottspark for great views\n\nÃ–land\n\n(See Blog Post - A Day Tour of the Swedish island of Ã–land)\n\nIt wasnâ€™t until my visit to the small Swedish city of Kalmar, that I had first heard about the island of Ã–land, which lies right next to the city, accessible by a bridge and is full of old relics of Swedenâ€™s past. So you can rest assured that I took some time out to explore this island when visiting Kalmar. The origins of Ã–land date back to around 8000 BC where early settlers were able to access the island (and present-day Kalmar) by using an ice bridge that formed across the Kalmar Strait. The island is full of Viking-age burial grounds and ring forts, all of which have yielded about 24,000 artifacts to date.\n\nIsmantorp Fortress, Borgholm Castle, Eketorps Borg, TrÃ¤by Borg are some historical sites\n\nKÃ¶pingsvik Beach, Lerkaka, Karl X Gustavs Mur are nice parks\n\nLÃ¥nge Jan, LÃ¥nge Erik for some cool lighthouses!\n\nMarstrand\n\n(See Blog Post - A day trip to the Swedish island of Marstrand)\n\nMarstrand has always been one of those places I have heard about since living in Sweden, but was never really a priority for me to see. Itâ€™s not so much a city, but an island, situated about an hour north of Swedenâ€™s 2nd most populous city of Gothenburg. The island is a popular spot for sailing and boat races. It has a population of around 1,320 inhabitants and is part of VÃ¤stra Gotland county. The best thing to do on this wonderful island is to walk along its periphery and take in the wonderful coastlines, especially if you are coming in the spring and summer months. Then end up at one of the local cafes and have a coffee and Cardamom bun.\n\nCarlstens FÃ¤stning is an absolute must see\n\nVisby\n\n(Blog Post - A Closer Look at the Hanseatic Town of Visby in Gotland, Sweden)\n\nVisby is a Medieval walled city, located on the Swedish island of Gotland, that houses roughly 40% of the Gotland population. The Old Town itself is in such an exceptional state that Visby was crowned a UNESCO World Heritage site back from 1995. And appropriately enough, the city hosts a Medieval Festival every year. Visby is also called the City of Roses/Ruins, and its names comes from Old Norse of the words â€˜Visâ€™ and â€˜byâ€™ meaning â€˜place of sacrificesâ€™ and â€˜villageâ€™, respectively. The city can only be reached by flying directly into Visby airport or by taking the ferry from NynÃ¤shamn or Ã–land.\n\nFÃ¥rÃ¶\n\n(Blog Post - A Guide to the Swedish island of FÃ¥rÃ¶)\n\nThe Swedish island of FÃ¥rÃ¶ sits just off the coast of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Outside of the largest city of Visby on Gotland, it is the most popular place to visit within Gotland county. It has some spectacular natural rock formations, which I will discuss in this blog post, as well as old fishing villages and plentiful beaches to swim in the usually cold water.\n\nGotland\n\n(Blog Post - A Guide to the Swedish island of Gotland)\n\nGotland, located in the Baltic Sea, is the sunniest part of Sweden and arguably the best destination in Scandinavia. Its extensive shoreline and warmer climate (compared to the rest of Sweden), along with its long medieval history and intact walled city at Visby, easily made it one of my favorite places to see in Sweden. The population of Gotland is roughly, 57,000, with about 40% living in the county capital of Visby. The island can be reached by air via the Visby airport or by ferry from either NynÃ¤shamn (via 1.5 hour train South from Stockholm) or Ã–land.\n\nThe Castles of Sweden\n\n(Blog Post - A Tour of Sweden's Coolest Castles)\n\nThe castles that were built by the Swedes no doubt played a major role in the defense of the country. There are even some castles that were built by Swedish enemies, on conquered Swedish land at the time, which were subsequently taken back under control. As you can imagine, the history of each individual castle must be long and storied. I will talk about a handful of the castles I have been to myself and give a brief historical rundown on its existence and place in history, but bear in mind that this list is nowhere near comprehensive.\n\nNorway\n\nOslo, Bergen, Stavanger, TromsÃ¸, Trolltunga, Preikestolen, and the Lofoten Islands\n\nJust a few things to note about Norway before your visit:\n\nScandinavia is Expensive, and Norway is no exception. Try to budget accordingly.\n\nSpeaking to point 1, a lot of travelers stay in hostels and cook their own meals to keep costs down.\n\nEveryone is friendly! And they all speak excellent english.\n\nIf you want to drive through the country just know that Norway is LONG. Its true size is skewed on a typical map, so plan accordingly.\n\nBecause it is so beautiful, only take photos when you have pulled off in an appropriate area. There are accidents every year of people not respecting the road ways while trying to capture the countryâ€™s beauty.\n\nThe currency is the Norwegian Krone, or NOK.\n\nExpect to take some ferries in your routes, which will save you time overall.\n\nOslo\n\n(Blog Post - Oslo: A Guide to the Norwegian Capital)\n\nOslo was the first Norwegian city that I happened to visit in the country. As the capital of Norway, it is its most populated city and has origins dating back to the end of the Viking Age in 1040. Present day, it is a â€˜Beta World Cityâ€™ and is home to many maritime industries. The city was rather large as it also spans the adjacent BygdÃ¸y peninsula. I remember doing a lot of walking however in retrospect, I should have also taken some of the ferries that were available as well. I would recommend three days to really see what Oslo is about. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above. In the meantime, here are some pretty cool places in Oslo:\n\nOslo Opera House - What is so spectacular about this building is that its exterior serves as a plaza for patrons to walk on to enjoy panoramic views of Oslo. This means you can go from ground level and go up the angled walkway of the faÃ§ade, all the way to the roof.\n\nAkershus Fortress - A castle and modern-day museum that was first constructed a defense for the city against mostly Swedish forces centuries ago.\n\nViking Ship Museum - This museum on the BygdÃ¸y peninsula contains actual unearthed Viking ships in excellent condition.\n\nBergen\n\n(Blog Post - Exploring Norway's 2nd City: Bergen)\n\nBergen is Norwayâ€™s 2nd city, that is it is the 2nd most populated and as in most countries, is a natural rival (so to speak) with the capital city of Oslo. It is located on the western side of Norway and is known as the â€˜city of 7 mountainsâ€™. Indeed, you can even hike to some amazing viewpoints to see all of Bergen in its entirety. The city was founded in 1070 and served as Norwayâ€™s capital only in the 13th century. I have been to the city twice myself, separated by a few years. I was fortunate enough to have good weather each time, which is quite rare. Nonetheless, the city was very walkable and could be seen in roughly 2 days. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above. In the meantime, here are some pretty cool places in Bergen:\n\nBryggen - A UNESCO World Heritage Site) which is a series of Hanseatic heritage buildings in the VÃ¥gen harbor. The buildings themselves are rather old, but are currently used as museums, restaurants, and bars.\n\nMt. FlÃ¸yen - A mountain top giving great views over all of Bergen. You can take the FlÃ¸ibanen Funicular to reach it.\n\nBergenhus Fortress - A castle that dates back to the 13th century. It is very well preserved and is a gorgeous area to walk around and read more about the history of its existence. The castle is one of the oldest and best preserved stone fortifications in Norway.\n\nKode Art Museum - The museum boasts pieces from Picasso, Dahl, DalÃ­ and more dispersed across 4 buildings in the city center. Old antiques are also showpieces in some of the exhibitions as well.\n\nTrolltunga and Stavanger\n\n(Blog Post - The Perfect Road Trip to Hike Trolltunga and Preikestolen in Norway)\n\nStavanger is the 4th largest city in Norway and is home to the Norwegian oil industry. It is also home to a number of international military installations, like the NATO Join Warfare Center. It was founded all the way back in 1125 with the completion of the Stavanger cathedral. It has a small town feel due to its large amount of 18th and 19th century wooden houses that are now part of the cityâ€™s cultural heritage.\n\nI flew into Stavanger and used it as a starting point in a mini road trip to see Preikestolen and Trolltunga, two amazing natural formations in the Norwegian countryside that have become quite popular over the recent years:\n\nPreikestolen translates to 'The Pulpit Rock', 'Pulpit', or 'Preacher's Chair' and is located in the Strand municipality. It is a steep cliff that is 604 meters above the Lysefjord. The top is uncharacteristically flat and almost a perfect 25 by 25 meter square. There is a lodge at the start of this hike where people can use facilities and grab food before the nearly 2 hour hike to the top.\n\nTrolltunga translates to \"Troll tongue\" is another rock formation near the village of Skjeggedal in Norway. It sits 1100 meters above sea level and the rock that resembles the â€˜tongueâ€™ juts out horizontally from the cliffside. The hike itself is challenging with the first four kilometers giving the most drastic change in elevation. Camping is not allowed on the site unless with a licensed guide. And with how popular this hike has become in recent years, I cannot recommend this option enough as we had the entire formation to ourselves during our trip.\n\nTromsÃ¸\n\n(Blog Post - A Guide to Exploring TromsÃ¸: Norway's Northernmost City in the Arctic Circle)\n\nTromsÃ¸ is located in Northern Norway and is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and third largest in the Arctic Circle after the cities of Murmansk and Norilsk in Russia. The city spans the island of TromsÃ¸ya and the landmasses on either side of it. As north as it sits geographically, the climate is actually very mild due to its position in the North Atlantic Drift (a Gulf Stream effect). Check out my blog post for more information on the link above. In the meantime, here are some pretty cool places in TromsÃ¸:\n\nArctic Cathedral - This church possesses a large glass faÃ§ade on its west side, and a large glass mosaic on its eastern side. There is a small fee to enter the church to see this glass mosaic in full. Nevertheless, the church was created by Jan Inge Hovig and dedicated in 1965.\n\nFjellheisen - A tramway located on the east side of the city (across the bridge) and takes you up to Tromsdalstinden, the 1,238 meter high peak that towards over the area. I cannot recommend this place enough in the summer to see the midnight sun!\n\nTromsÃ¸ Harbor - There are plenty of restaurants here as well, but perhaps on the more pricier side. The collections of boats and view of TromsÃ¸ over the water towards the East are what make this spot particularly charming during golden hour.\n\nStorgata - The main thoroughfare through TromsÃ¸. This is the main street of the city with restaurants, cafes, and souvenir/specialty shops.\n\nLofoten - AustvÃ¥gÃ¸ya\n\n(Blog Post - A Journey to the Lofoten Islands: The Island of AustvÃ¥gÃ¸ya)\n\nThe island of AustvÃ¥gÃ¸ya is a part of the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland County, Norway. There are a plethora of hikes to undertake on the island: FlÃ¸ya, FestvÃ¥gtind, Matmora, and Djevelporten. Also including the towns of Slovaer and Henningsvaer, the latter is probably one of the best to explore in warmer weather. It is known for its football stadium, built into one of the outer islands of town. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above.\n\nHenningsvaer - A fishing village located on the islands of HeimÃ¸ya and HellandsÃ¸ya. The town has a population of 510 and is replete with cafes and a large harbor for seemingly all the residentsâ€™ boats. Do yourself a favor and park in the town by the grocery store and take an hour to walk around the area.\n\nMatmora - A hike starting in the small town of Laukvik and easily one of the best hikes in Lofoten. The hike takes you along meandering pathways, flanked by plush green trees, with occasional appearances by the loitering sheep. The vegetation starts to disappear as you ascend higher and about 1 hour into the hike, you can see the summit.\n\nDjupfjorden - A tidal lake separated from the sea by a land bridge. You will know youâ€™ve reached it when you see a lot of cars on the side of the road for seemingly no reason. If you do find a parking, you can climb up the rocky terrain (I managed in my sandals) and get a perfect view of the mountains across the landscape over the sea.\n\nRorvikstranda - This beach was just off the main E10 road on the way to HenningsvÃ¦r. What I really enjoyed about it was the turquoise color of the water. It was so intense and the wildflower vegetation of the area just added to the enchanting vibe.\n\nLofoten - VestvÃ¥gÃ¸ya\n\n(Blog Post - A Journey to the Lofoten Islands: The Island of VestvÃ¥gÃ¸ya)\n\nThe island of VestvÃ¥gÃ¸ya is a part of the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland County, Norway. There are a plethora of hikes to undertake on the island: Mannen, Offersoykammen, Nonstind, Veggen, and Kleivheia. There are a number of beaches too at Uttakleiv, Unstad, and Haukland. Lastly, a kayaking during the midnight sun in Eggum in a must do when here in the summer. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above.\n\nUnstad Beach - This beach has been prominently featured in many travel websites and blogs. It is one of the more popular beaches in Lofoten with silky white sand, flanked on both sides with large boulders.\n\nOffersoykammen - This is a small mountain peak that you can hike to, giving you amazing views of Nappstraumen below. It was a more demanding hike for us, as it was quite steep until it starts to flatten out a bit near the summit.\n\nBorge Church - This church has a red and white facade, perfectly contrasting with the wide expanse of (mostly) farmland in the distance. The church is concrete and was built in a fan-shape style in 1986, the vision by architect Knut Gjernes. It can fit 600 people and was consecrated in 1987.\n\nMaervoll - A village in the Steinsfjord, most known for its spectacular vista of Himmeltinden in the distance. This mountain stands 964 meters tall and is the perfect backdrop for an afternoon picnic, which is what we did.\n\nLofoten - FlakstadÃ¸ya\n\n(Blog Post - A Journey to the Lofoten Islands: The Island of FlakstadÃ¸ya)\n\nThe island of FlakstadÃ¸ya is a part of the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland County, Norway. There are many hikes to undertake on the island: Hustinden, Volandstind, Moltind, and Nubben. There are a number of beaches too at Skagsanden, Rambergstranda, and Flakstad. The town of Vikten is a MUST visit to see the glass blowing at Glashytta KafÃ©. Lastly, Nusfjord is a charming fishing village you can't miss. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above.\n\nNusfjord - This is a small fishing village on the south shore of FlakstadÃ¸ya. There are a number of rorbu cabins here, many of them red, some are yellow that are spread across the landscape. The town is perfectly intertwined with nature and around every corner was a photographic opportunity.\n\nFlakstad Church - This church is located in the village of Flakstad (obviously). The church was built in a cruciform style in 1780. For me, I really liked its red color and the surrounding grounds.\n\nLofoten - MoskenesÃ¸ya\n\n(Blog Post - A Journey to the Lofoten Islands: The Island of MoskenesÃ¸ya)\n\nThe island of MoskenesÃ¸ya is a part of the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland County, Norway. There are a plethora of hikes to undertake on the island: Reine, Ryten, RÃ¸ren, Andstabben, and Munken. Some great beaches to check out are also at Kvalvika, Horseid, and Bunes. Lastly, the fishing villages of HamnÃ¸y and SakrisÃ¸y are incredibly picturesque and worth stopping for. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above.\n\nRyten - Ryten is a huge cliff that is 543 meters in elevation and because of that, it takes a few hours to get to the summit in a well marked path, however with somewhat steep terrain when you get close to the top. The photographic shot you want is the small outcrop of rocks that jut out into the air, over Kvalvika Beach below.\n\nHamnÃ¸y - One of the more iconic villages in all of Lofoten. Youâ€™ve seen those pictures before: these gorgeous red colored cabins [called rorbu, or rorbuer (plural)], standing on wooden planks above the turquoise blue water with a mountain backdrop.\n\nReine - This village has a population of only 314, but seems much larger giving all the tourists that love to visit.\n\nSakrisÃ¸y - Another small island similar to HamnÃ¸y. It sits at the foot of Olstind mountain with its own set of fisherman cabins you can stay at. Take a walk around this island as well if you havenâ€™t gotten your fix from HamnÃ¸y.\n\nLofoten - VaerÃ¸y\n\n(Blog Post - A Journey to the Lofoten Islands: The Island of VÃ¦rÃ¸y)\n\nThe island of VÃ¦rÃ¸y is a part of the Lofoten archipelago in Nordland County, Norway. It is home to roughly 728 people and accessible only by ferry from Mostenes or BÃ¸do. The viewpoint after hiking to HÃ¥en is one of the best in all of Lofoten. You can also hike at Nordlandsnuppen, Plantefeltet, and VÃ¦rÃ¸yhornet. A day trip here is all you need to see the southern tip of the Lofoten Islands. Check out my blog post for more information on the link above.\n\nFerry - the ferry from Mosekenes to Vaeroy is FREE!\n\nSÃ¸rland - This resort and fishing village is the administrative center of the municipality with a population of 640.\n\nThe Epic Lofoten Road Trip\n\n(Blog Post - The Epic Lofoten Islands Road Trip)\n\nThe Lofoten Islands are located in Nordland County in Norway. They are composed of the islands GimsÃ¸y, AustvÃ¥gÃ¸y, VestvÃ¥gÃ¸ya, FlakstadÃ¸ya, MostenesÃ¸ya, and VÃ¦rÃ¸y. These islands are some of the most beautiful in the world and a summertime road trip to Lofoten is a huge bucket list item. My favorite spots were HenningsvÃ¦r, Reine, Ryten, Nusfjord, Vikten, OffersÃ¸ykammen, and Eggum, to name a few! Check out my blog post for more information on the link above.\n\nDenmark\n\nAarhus, Odense, Copenhagen\n\nJust a few things to note about Denmark before your visit:\n\nDenmarkâ€™s currency is the Danish Krone (DKK).\n\nWhen you first land in Denmark, you can already understand why the people here, and the country as a whole, are consistently considered the happiest in the world. From my experience, the Danish are very friendly and open minded. This probably stems from their access to health care and quality education, excellent social services, and trust in their government.\n\nThe Danes are fluent in â€˜hyggeâ€™, which stands for â€˜intentional intimacyâ€™. These are described as interactions with friends and family that breed camaraderie and valuable shared experiences and are integral to the happiness they are known for having. The term is also used to describe a general cozy atmosphere, such as wearing comfortable clothes inside on a cold winter day in front of a lit fireplace (count me in).\n\nAarhus\n\n(Blog Post: A Weekend Trip to the Danish town of Aarhus)\n\nAarhus is the largest city situated in Jutland county in Denmark, home to about 336,000 inhabitants (at the time of writing this article). It is a city ripe with student life, as can be seen by the plethora of cafes and bicycles ever present on these city streets. After all it is home to the largest university in Scandinavia (Aarhus University). Furthermore, it is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, dating back to the 8th century.\n\nAarhus Museum of Art (ARos) and Marselisborg Slott are places to check out.\n\nMÃ¸lleparken and The Dome are cool spots for chill.\n\nThe Infinite Bridge is not to be missed!\n\nOdense\n\n(Blog Post: Exploring Odense, Denmark: The Birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen)\n\nOdense is the third largest city in Denmark and the birthplace of famous Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, who is highly esteemed in literature and perhaps most famous for writing The Little Mermaid. The city name itself comes from the phrase â€˜Odins VÃ©' which means â€˜Odin's sanctuaryâ€™ (Odin being a God in Norse Mythology).\n\nOdense Cathedral and Odense Slott are worth seeing.\n\nEventyrhaven is an amazing park that is quiet and secluded.\n\nCopenhagen\n\n(Blog Post: The Perfect Guide to Exploring Copenhagen)\n\nThe Danish capital of Copenhagen has plenty to offer at all times of the year. My journey there was around Easter, so the colder winter weather had subsided enough to make my stay more than tolerable there. Aside from doing a walking tour, I decided to walk aimlessly in the hope of stumbling upon interesting sights. The city is mostly flat, thus very walkable.\n\nKastellet is an amazing star fort that is popular for runners and walkers.\n\nNyhavn Harbor and the Danish Royal Library Gardens are must see places.\n\nRelated Posts"
