        "text": "Northern Europe has traditionally included Iceland, Finland, and the three Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (including the Faroe Islands which are part of Denmark). These countries are often referred to as the Nordic countries. Scandinavia is sometimes used as a synonym for the Nordic countries, but that term more properly refers to the three monarchies of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nAll these countries were influenced by Viking heritage and expansion.\n\nTheir capital cities are also major ports. Click on the images to see them in a larger format, if you want. üôÇ\n\nThe Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Faroese languages are all rooted in Old Norse, and Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are considered mutually intelligible. Almost all elementary school children in the Nordic countries are taught English as a second language.\n\nMost of Iceland‚Äôs inhabitants are descendants of Scandinavian Vikings. An ethnic group that lives in the region is the S√°mi people.\n\nThese countries were kingdoms, and their royal families remain highly regarded members of society.\n\nNote to our Christian viewers: The following optional video briefly mentions how Mary Donaldson encountered a ‚Äúfortune teller‚Äù who read tarot cards to her (timestamp 5:58).\n\nThe colder northern climate has helped shape the cultural activities and the winter sports that are part of the region‚Äôs heritage. Peripheral isolation from the rest of Europe because of their northern location and dividing bodies of water have allowed the northern culture to be preserved for centuries and shape the societies that now exist in northern Europe.\n\nHuman rights, education, and social concerns are high priorities of the governments of northern Europe, and the quality of these elements rank highly by global comparisons. Standards of living are among the highest in Europe. In the World Happiness Report, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden consistently rank in the top 10 countries. There are quite a few books that cover this subject that you may find interesting to read!\n\nIsolation in northern Europe does create an element of economic cost, and transportation technology has been leveraged to address this.\n\nThe √òresund Bridge has been constructed across the Baltic Sea from Denmark to Sweden to increase the flow of people, goods, and materials between the Scandinavian Peninsula and mainland Europe.\n\nScandinavian cuisine is traditionally simple. Fish (particularly herring), meat, potatoes, and dairy products play prominent roles without many spices. In Iceland, due to the island‚Äôs climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food.\n\nSome foods of the region include:\n\nNorthern Europe is known for its concern for the social welfare of its citizens. Their strong egalitarian ideals have contributed to extensive advancements in free medical care, free education, and free social services for all, regardless of nationality or minority status.\n\nCivil rights for minorities, women, and other groups is assured and protected. Denmark doesn‚Äôt have a legal age for consumption of alcoholic beverages, though tradition sets the age at about fourteen. Culture and the arts are well developed; examples include everything from the Nobel Peace Prize to Hans Christian Anderson to the 1970s chart-topping pop group ABBA. Sweden has become a major exporter of music worldwide.\n\nIceland is the most remote of the Nordic countries. Its small population‚Äîless than a half-million people‚Äîis connected to Europe by sea and air transportation and communication technologies.\n\nMost Icelanders are descendants of Norse and Gaelic settlers. Even though it‚Äôs closer to Greenland, an island of North America, it‚Äôs generally included in Europe for geographical, historical, political, cultural, linguistic and practical reasons.\n\nIceland is highly geologically active with many volcanoes. With the widespread availability of geothermal power and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity, most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating, and electricity.\n\nThe climate of Iceland‚Äôs coast is subarctic, but the warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world.\n\nCenturies of isolation have helped to insulate the country‚Äôs Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the Icelandic language, which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Nordic languages.\n\nEgalitarianism is highly valued among the people of Iceland, with income inequality being among the lowest in the world. As in other Nordic countries, equality between the sexes is very high; Iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in.\n\nThere are more islands in this part of the world besides Iceland. The Faroe Islands belong to Denmark and are about halfway between Norway and Iceland. The name of the islands translates to ‚ÄúIslands of Sheep.‚Äù These islands are a group of 18 islands that are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly cliffs.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable independence movement that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. The following video will tell you all about these islands:\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n‚úé Northern Europe has traditionally included Iceland, Finland, and the three Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.\n\n‚úé These countries have a Viking heritage.\n\n‚úé Iceland is the most remote Nordic country known for its volcanoes.\n\n‚úé The Faroe Islands belong to Denmark, but there has been a noteable movement for independence.\n\nNext: 6.4: Southern Europe\n\nWe want to know what you thought of what you just read and watched!
