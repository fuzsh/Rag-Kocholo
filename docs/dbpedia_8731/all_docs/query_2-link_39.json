        "text": "NATO’s Nordic bloc: Big promise, lurking problems\n\nFinland and Sweden will add considerable military assets to NATO, but divergent policies can weaken the geopolitical impact of the Nordic bloc.\n\nThe inclusion of Finland and Sweden into NATO now looks increasingly likely. There are still some remaining questions regarding ratification by Turkey (and perhaps by Hungary), but assuming those will be straightened out, what are the implications of the creation of a new Nordic bloc in the Western alliance?\n\nFirst and foremost, it will remove the edge of the Kremlin’s posture toward the Nordic region. Moscow’s threats issued at the outset of the year about severe consequences if the two dared even to contemplate joining NATO have proven little more than hot air. When Russian President Vladimir Putin encounters determined resistance, he backs off, which is an important takeaway.\n\nNordic bloc’s potential\n\nLooking beyond the Kremlin’s failure to prevent this outcome, the main questions concern what it will mean for the northern flank of NATO, now and in the future. Would the emergence of a coherent Nordic bloc make a difference in the West’s relations with Russia?\n\nThe outlook rests on two baseline assumptions. The first is that once the war in Ukraine has ended, NATO will be faced with a long-term commitment to contain a weakened Russia that remains armed with nuclear weapons; the task will require significant resolve. The second is that unless the sanctions regime is lifted, Russia will be unable to rebuild its prewar conventional military capabilities, not to mention introduce new weapons or even upgrade its existing stock. That implies that NATO will start the new chapter with a significant edge.\n\nThe inclusion of Finland and Sweden will enhance NATO’s capabilities in two critical ways. One is simple geography. The Baltic Sea will no longer be a gray security zone, and Finland’s 1,340-kilometer border with Russia will no longer be a source of concern about a land invasion that could threaten NATO in the north. The combined outcome will be a degradation of the Russian security situation in the Nordic and Arctic regions.\n\nMilitary strength\n\nSecondly, both Nordic countries have a long track record of successful cooperation with NATO. They have NATO-compatible force structures, and both have been alternately designated as NATO’s “number one partner.” It speaks volumes that none of the existing members objected to their joining on military grounds.\n\nAccepting that Finland and Sweden will add serious strength to the alliance, what does this, in turn, mean for the future posture of NATO’s northern flank?\n\nThe main asset of a new Nordic bloc is its combined air force. All told, the four Nordic members will be operating 239 top-of-the-line combat jets. Once contracted deliveries have been completed, Denmark, Norway and Finland will be flying 143 American F-35 fighters:\n\nIn recent years, the Finnish and Swedish air forces have been involved in numerous bilateral tactical exercises. They have ample experience of drills together with NATO aviation in the north of Sweden. The flyers will be supported by the advanced Swedish Erieye Airborne Early Warning and Control System and operate from airfields close to critical Russian infrastructure and base areas.\n\nShoring up defense\n\nIncluding Finland and Sweden in NATO will also significantly alter the dynamics in the Baltic Sea area. When the two Nordic countries were neutral, the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet could operate largely unconstrained out of naval bases at Kronstadt, outside St. Petersburg, and at Baltiysk in the Kaliningrad exclave. Its main adversary would be smallish Polish, German and Danish naval assets.\n\nA big part of the Russian lock on the Baltic was the A2/AD (anti-access/area denial) “bubble” at Kaliningrad, which posed a formidable threat to NATO naval movements in the Baltic Sea. There was also a latent threat that a swift Russian airborne assault to capture the demilitarized Swedish island of Gotland, strategically located in the center of the Baltic, would have made that lock even more formidable.\n\nLooking forward, the Baltic Sea will now, for all intents and purposes, become a NATO lake, where the Russian Baltic Fleet may operate when and how NATO allows it to do so. During a time of crisis, Russian assets would be bottled up.\n\nFinland and Estonia are currently discussing the development of anti-ship missiles that would effectively throw a barrier across the Gulf of Finland. Given that the distance from Tallinn to Helsinki is only 87 kilometers, shore batteries on both sides would ensure that no Russian surface vessels from Kronstadt could pass into the Baltic without permission.\n\nThen there are Swedish submarines. While Finland has not developed its submarines since World War II (first because of prohibitions in the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties, and then since 1990 by choice), the Swedish Navy has a long tradition of operating sophisticated subs in the tricky brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. In a crisis, they may be relied upon to undertake aggressive mining of the Russian ports at Kronstadt and Baltiysk and to lie in stealthy ambush for antiquated Russian subs trying to leave their bases.\n\nIn the southern Baltic, the Kaliningrad fortress will be countered by Danish missile defenses and air force assets on the island of Bornholm, by stealthy Swedish missile corvettes patrolling the approaches to Baltiysk, and by a determined Swedish buildup of assets on Gotland, ranging from Patriot missiles to mechanized ground forces and a naval base.\n\nContaining Russia\n\nFinally, Finland and Sweden will strengthen NATO with ground forces with considerable combat experience in mountainous Arctic territory. These forces have exercised with NATO units in war games like Cold Response. Together with Norway, they will present a powerful threat to Russia’s basing areas on the Kola Peninsula, home to its Northern Fleet and an important component of its nuclear forces.\n\nThe alliance’s Nordic expansion will transform the long border between Finland and Russia into a significant Russian vulnerability. In a crisis, Finland can mobilize 280,000 well-trained and motivated troops, supported by the most powerful artillery force in Europe. The crucial role played by artillery during the war in Ukraine has brought home that Finland was correct in ensuring that its arsenal includes 700 howitzers, 700 heavy mortars and 100 multiple rocket launchers. For Russia, such a force constitutes a powerful deterrent."
