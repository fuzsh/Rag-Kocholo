Copenhagen is a place that is never without things to do.\n\nWith a population of around 1.4 million people, Copenhagen is situated of Zealand and Amager. Historically, Copenhagen was a Viking fishing village that was created in the 10th century. Due to its proximity to the Oresund strait, and neighboring islands, its promptly became a trading hub for surrounding towns.\n\nDIS is a non-profit study abroad foundations whose priority is to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment in the various Scandinavian countries that it operates in.

DIS holds a full arrival workshop planned to help students adjust to life in Copenhagen.
