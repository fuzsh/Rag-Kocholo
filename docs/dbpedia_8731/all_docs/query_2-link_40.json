Map of Sweden and surrounding countries (Northern Europe - Europe) to download. Sweden borders with Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel across the Øresund as its shown in the map of Sweden and surrounding countries. Norway as one of Sweden surrounding countries established diplomatic relations in 1905, after Norway independence from the union between Sweden and Norway. Sweden has an embassy in Oslo. Norway has an embassy in Stockholm and three consulates in Gothenburg, Malmö and Sundsvall. Both countries are full members of Council of Europe. There are around 44,773 Norwegians living in Sweden and around 100,000 Swedes living in Norway.\n\nSweden surround countries map\n\nprintPrint system_update_altDownload\n\nFinnish–Swedish relations have a long history, due to the close relationship between Finland and Sweden as its mentioned in the map of Sweden and surrounding countries. Particularly in Finland, the issue emerges in frequent exposés of Finnish history, and in motives for governmental proposals and actions as reported in Finnish news broadcasts in English or other foreign languages. In Sweden, this relationship is a recurrent important theme of 20th-century history, although maybe by most Swedes considered to be an issue of purely historical relevance now that both countries have been members of the European Union since 1995.\n\nToday, both countries are separated by the Øresund, which links the Baltic Sea and the North Sea as you can see in the map of Sweden and surrounding countries. Denmark has an embassy in Stockholm and 2 general consulates (in Gothenburg and Malmö). Sweden has an embassy in Copenhagen and 16 honorary consulates (in Aabenraa, Aarhus, Aalborg, Esbjerg, Frederikshavn, Grenå, Helsingør, Holbæk, Kolding, Nuuk, Nykøbing Falster, Odense, Rønne, Skagen, Tórshavn and Viborg). Both countries are full members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, of the Council of Europe, and of the European Union. There are around 21,000 Swedish people living in Denmark and there are around 42,000 Danish people living in Sweden."
