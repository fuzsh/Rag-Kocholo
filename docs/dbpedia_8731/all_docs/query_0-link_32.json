        "text": "Funny Movie\n\nIf someone ever asks you if you would like to see a Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, Finnish or Russian comedy then...well, I won’t say “Run for your life!!” but I will say “Be careful”.\n\nMovies in the north loves to deal with serious issues like death, drugs, alcohol and other fun stuff, and even most of our comedies will leave you with a feeling that the world is a horrible place.\n\nYou think I’m exaggerating? Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you when you sit in the dark, crying.\n\nA nice example is this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE4ZBcK01HU It’s considered one of the funniest scenes in the movie. He doesn’t like that the cow is looking at him.\n\nAnd punching woman is funny too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2WrE7SKmK4\n\n898 comments\n\nSee more of Norway Denmark Sweden America Russia\n\n3rd of April\n\nThe law is the law\n\nApparently there is an old forgotten Danish law that nobody cared to remove, that says that if the Öresund sea freeze, and a Swede walks over to Denmark, Danes are allowed to hit him with sticks. The law doesn’t mention Norwegians, so they are free to visit.\n\nObviously the law if from back when Sweden and Denmark were constantly at war.\n\nAnd Denmark and Sweden are friends now, so after getting this out of the way, Denmark invited Sweden for hot coco as well.\n\n527 comments\n\nSee more of Denmark Sweden\n\n15th of March\n\nNordic Morning\n\n(Please fullview. Looks tons better)\n\nSweden: Reading a Swedish newspaper.\n\nFinland: Reading Sweden’s newspaper, and being slightly annoyed that he can understand it.\n\nNorway: Making sure Denmark gets something to eat.\n\nDenmark: Just woke up after spending the night under the table.\n\nIceland: Has been up for an hour and just came home after his usual morning jog.\n\nI’ve been wanting to draw these guys eating breakfast together for a long time, and now I finally did. Also had fun using this style of colouring again.\n\n593 comments\n\nSee more of Sweden Finland Norway Denmark Iceland\n\n5th of March\n\nOh no he didn't\n\nAmerica can be a little touchy on the subject, even when he is not directly involved.\n\nWe are no way near as touchy about slavery in Scandinavia because we mainly had white slaves from our own countries and Ireland.\n\n558 comments\n\nSee more of Denmark America Republic Of The Congo\n\n25th of February\n\nWinter Olympics\n\nAnd Scandinavia and the World is back! Thank you for being patient (Well, most of you anyway).\n\nPeople keep asking if I’ll do a comic about the winter Olympics but I think sports are amazingly boring, so I’m not following them at all.\n\nBut a few days ago I came across an OL sum up on TV, and this was all I gathered from it:\n\nDenmark sucks at everything that involves snow and/or ice.\n\nThis is probably the only winter OL comic I’ll do, so enjoy it.\n\n365 comments\n\nSee more of Norway Denmark Sweden Olympics\n\n18th of February\n\nWorld View\n\nInspired by this drawing http://rondell.deviantart.com/art/Scandinavia-and-the-World-151389350 by http://rondell.deviantart.com/\n\nSouth America is not North America’s invisible friend here. The Scandinavian boys just can't see him, just like North America can't see Denmark.\n\nFew people in America know what Denmark is and surprisingly many sees Norway as the same thing as Sweden, which sounds ridicules to us over here, but I can guarantee you that if you asked random people on the streets of Scandinavia what all that land underneath America is, too many would either say “I don’t know” “Isn’t it all America?” or “Mexico?”. Or they would know it was South America, but have no idea what the countries within it was called. We know shit about South America.\n\nAnd I put a link on the comic this time as many people have requested.\n\n889 comments\n\nSee more of America Norway Sweden Denmark South America\n\n3rd of February\n\nNot a Yahtzee\n\nYou might have to say “yahtzee” out loud to get the joke.\n\nPretty much how the German government reacts whenever Nazis are mentioned, if German soldiers does something violent somewhere, or if anything that could in anyway make people think of Nazis happens. They’re quite paranoid about the subject.\n\n727 comments\n\nSee more of Germany Denmark Norway Sweden\n\n23rd of January\n\nFamily Photo\n\nI don’t even know. I just wanted to draw a picture of Sweden and his sister, and then this happened...\n\nOne has to wonder how these two ended up so different. Or is Sister Sweden more intelligent than she leads on? And is Sweden more wild under the serious facade than he will ever admit? We may never know.\n\nFinland is a fool if he thinks he can keep Sister Sweden to himself. She’s a bigger whore than Denmark, which makes her a pretty big whore.\n\nAnd I really should include Iceland more often. It has recently come to my attention that people think he is a sissy because he is all pretty and sparkly, when in fact he is the most hardcore of them all. This guy jumps into volcanoes with a parachute on and rides the hot air out again for fucks sake!\n\nAnd yes, he will land on them in a few seconds.\n\n493 comments\n\nSee more of Sweden Finland Denmark Norway Iceland Sister Sweden\n\n19th of January"
