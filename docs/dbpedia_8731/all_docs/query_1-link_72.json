        "text": "If you’ve recently obtained a Schengen visa, Europe is your oyster. With the ability to cross through 26 European countries without border checks, you can finally plan that Nordic vacation you’ve always wanted to take. Or, you can let us plan it for you.\n\nWe’ve created a Nordic travel itinerary for traveling through Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland in two weeks.\n\nFirst Stop: Iceland\n\nTime to Spend: 3 Days\n\nHow to Get There\n\nThere are multiple airlines that offer flights to Iceland year-round. You’ll most likely fly into Keflavik International Airport, which offers easy connections to the rest of Reykjavik. You can hail a taxi, rent a car, or take a bus – such as Flybus – to get to Reykjavik in about 45 minutes.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nIceland is a fairly remote country with only 2 major cities. For most travelers, Reykjavik is the prime Icelandic destination. If you’re more adventurous and plan on exploring the northern part of the island, you’ll most likely stay in Akureyri.\n\nLuxury Option: Icelandair Hotels offers luxury hotels in both Reykjavik and Akureyri. Prices start around $140/night.\n\nMidrange Option: Airbnb’s in Reykjavik and Akureyri range from about $80-$140/night.\n\nBudget Option: Laekur Hostel is a top-rated hostel in Reykjavik, with dormitory accommodations priced at around $40/night. The hostel is close to public bus stops, bakeries, and the coastline. Additionally, the Flybus from Keflavik International Airport stops at the hostel.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nDay 1:\n\nFirst on the list of things to do in Iceland is the Blue Lagoon. While it is a popular tourist attraction, it is not one to be missed. Only 50 minutes away from Reykjavik with direct transport from Keflavik International Airport, the Blue Lagoon offers spa amenities such as mud masks, steam rooms, and in-water massages.\n\nPrices range from $70 to $500 for luxury experiences. The ultimate relaxation destination, the Blue Lagoon is a must-do.\n\nIf tourist attractions aren’t your thing, you can check out the secret Seljavallalaug pool. Hidden in a valley near Seljavellir, this pool is heated by hot spring water from Eyjafjallajokull. Two hours southeast of Reykjavik, the only way to reach the pool is by driving and taking a short, 15-20-minute hike into the valley.\n\nDay 2:\n\nAfter relaxing in the Blue Lagoon or the Seljavallalaug pool, it’s time to enjoy more of the natural beauty that Iceland has to offer. Take a trip to Thrihnukagigur for a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience: a hike INSIDE a volcano.\n\nHiking is only available during the months of May to October. Only a 26-minute car ride from Reykjavik, hiking into Thrihnukagigur entails a 50-minute hike (about 2 miles each way) to the crater. You will then descend 400 feet into the crater, where an open-cable lift will take you down into the volcano.\n\nThe whole experience takes about 5-6 hours to complete, so this is the perfect adventure for day 2 in Iceland.\n\nDay 3:\n\nYou’ll probably be tired from your volcano hike yesterday, so a day spent whale and puffin watching is the perfect leisure activity to enjoy on your last day in Iceland.\n\nAfter your 3-hour whale-watching cruise or your 1-hour puffin-watching cruise, take the rest of the day to enjoy some of the local restaurants and shops in Reykjavik.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nIceland offers a variety of culinary delicacies, such as horse, puffin, and minke whale (maybe avoid these after your whale/puffin cruises). While there’s debate over the ethical implications of eating whale and horse, expect them to pop up on the menus in Iceland.\n\nFishmarkadurinn, otherwise known as the Fish Market, boasts a 4.5/5 rating on Trip Advisor. Its menu includes Icelandic delicacies such as grilled minke whale and smoked or grilled puffin breast.\n\nFor a more low-key option, try out Café Loki (see what I did there). It offers options like homemade rye bread, cured shark, and a plethora of Icelandic pastries.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nFor the most part, Reykjavik is fairly accessible by foot, local buses, and taxis. To get to excursion locations, rental cars are an option. Buses and domestic planes are available for destinations farther away, and ferries are also available for guided tours and travel.\n\nIf you're from one of these countries, you'll need a Schengen visa to visit this Schengen-Area country. Discover everything you need to know about the Schengen visa!\n\nSecond Stop: Denmark\n\nTime to Spend: 2 Days\n\nHow to Get There\n\nIcelandair offers a 3-hour flight from Keflavik International Airport to Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nA popular tourist destination, there are plenty of accommodation options throughout Denmark. Copenhagen offers the greatest number of hotel and hostel options, but Aarhus is another popular destination with lots of accommodation options.\n\nLuxury Option: Villa Provence, in Aarhus, offers a romantic charm in contrast to “Scandi minimalism.” Villa Provence is within walking distance of train stations, bus stops, and various site-seeing attractions. Rooms start at around $180/night.\n\nMidrange Option: Cabinn Aarhus Hotel offers rooms starting at around $100/night. Located near the Cathedral, the Cabinn Aarhus Hotel is a short walk to cafes and shops along the Aarhus River.\n\nBudget Option: Hallo Hostel Aarhus, located close to the Aarhus River, offers beds in mixed dormitories starting at about $40/night.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nDay 1:\n\nA short 12-minute walk from Cabinn Aarhus Hotel and Hallo Hostel Aarhus is ARoS Aarhus Art Museum. Famous for its Rainbow Panorama, the ARoS Aarhus Art Museum currently features exhibitions on American pop art, Egyptian contemporary art, and more.\n\nAfter spending an hour or two at the museum, hop on an hour-and-a-half train ride up to Aalborg for a melodic stroll through the Park of Music, otherwise known as the Singing Trees. Trees in the park have been planted by famous musicians, and the music of each plays under their designated tree.\n\nDay 2:\n\nNo trip to Denmark would be complete without a visit to the nation’s famous capital. From Aarhus, you can hop on a 3-hour train ride to Copenhagen. Indulge your inner tourist and visit sites like Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen’s theme park and gardens.\n\nIf you’re a literary fan, the Little Mermaid is the perfect stop for you. It was inspired by the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and was gifted to the city of Copenhagen by Carl Jacobsen.\n\nA short walk away from Tivoli Gardens, you can visit Selma, a Danish restaurant famous for its Smorrebrod. This traditional, open-face dish consists of rye bread, fish or meat, vegetables, and sauce on top.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nIf Smorrebrod isn’t your thing, Denmark offers many other delectable delicacies. While in Denmark, you can visit Beyti for durum shawarma, made popular thanks to Turkish and Pakistani refugees in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nFor those who’ve never had it before, shawarma is a traditional Middle Eastern sandwich made from meat (usually chicken or lamb) that is spit-roasted and shaved onto the sandwich. There is a wide array of toppings for shawarma, like hummus, tahini, and tabbouleh.\n\nIf you happen to be visiting during Christmas time, Flaekesteg, or roast pork, is a local favorite. You can find it throughout Danish Christmas market stands.\n\nFinally, if you’re looking for a place to dine while exploring Aarhus, you can check out Mefisto. Top-ranked on Trip Advisor, Mefisto places emphasis on fish and seafood, offering delicious dishes like prawns and lobster.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nDenmark is well connected, with trains, buses, and bicycles readily available to take you to your next destination.\n\nTrain travel in Denmark consists of local trains and regional trains. In Copenhagen, the train system is known as the S-Tog, and stations are marked with a large red sign featuring a white “S” in the middle. While in Copenhagen, you can also take the metro to get around.\n\nBus travel in Denmark is also well-organized. Buses can take you across town, and they also connect to train stations throughout Copenhagen. There are major bus services in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense, and Southern Denmark. Keep in mind that buses only stop at stations when passengers hit the stop button, or when someone is waiting to get on.\n\nThird Stop: Norway\n\nTime to Spend: 3 Days\n\nHow to Get There\n\nYou can take a ferry from Hirtshals, Denmark to Kristiansand, Norway. The ferry operates 3 times a day and the trip takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes. From Kristiansand, hop on a train for a 4-and-a-half-hour ride to Oslo.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nAs the nation’s capital, Oslo has plenty of accommodations options.\n\nLuxury Option: The Thief Hotel is a luxury hotel in Oslo. Located in the middle of downtown Oslo, the Thief Hotel offers rooms starting at around $350/night.\n\nMidrange Option: Self-described as being “for anyone who wants a cheap, urban, and efficient hotel in the center of Oslo,” the Comfort Hotel Express in Young Town Square, or Youngstorget, offers budget-friendly accommodation with shops and restaurants around the corner. Prices start at around $140/night.\n\nBudget Option: The Anker Hostel offers beds starting at $30/night, with single, private rooms costing about $65/night. The Anker Hostel is located in the city center, with bus, tram, and taxi accessibility right outside the hostel lobby.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nDay 1:\n\nStart things off in Norway by knocking out the touristy attractions in Oslo. A popular destination in the nation’s capital is the Oslo Cathedral. it was first established in 1697 and was restored in 1950 with its original baroque interior. The church is used for weddings and funerals by the Norwegian Royal Family and the Norwegian government.\n\nAfter your tour of the Oslo Cathedral, take a short, 8-minute walk to find the National Museum. The National Museum in Oslo is home to many of Edvard Munch’s paintings, most famously including The Scream. The museum also has a sculpture garden located outside.\n\nDay 2:\n\nAfter your touristy day in Oslo, visit Beito Husky Tours for the ultimate dog sledding adventure. The company offers an inclusive, full-day experience from Oslo, including an 8:35 a.m. bus ride from Oslo’s bus terminal to the site.\n\nThe experience includes a visit to the husky farm, a dog-sledding tour, and a wilderness meal. At the end of the day, the tour will drop you back off at the bus station to get you back to Oslo around 10 p.m.\n\nDay 3:\n\nIn a land famous for its fjords, it’d be silly not to visit one of these stunning inlets during your Norwegian vacation. A short flight from Oslo will get you to Alesund, where you can hop on a bus to Geiranger.\n\nSpend the day sightseeing Fjord Geiranger by boat or climb the 327 steps of the waterfall walk for breathtaking views.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nFor a truly authentic Norwegian meal, head over to Kaffistova, in Oslo. It offers traditional Norwegian foods like Norwegian meatballs, reindeer meat paddies, and salmon.\n\nIf you’re visiting during the Christmas season, be sure to try Pinnekjott. Pinnekjott consists of cured, cold air-dried lamb that is steamed with birch branches and served with sausages, mashed potatoes, and pureed swedes. You can try this local delicacy at Restaurant Schroder in Oslo.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nNorway has a comprehensive public transport system consisting of trains, buses, and ferries. The trains in Norway link Oslo to Stavanger, Bergen, and Trondheim.\n\nBuses in Norway connect almost every corner of the country. Ferries in Norway are either car ferries or passenger express boats.

Rooms start at around $500/night.\n\nMidrange Option: If a 5-star stay is out of your budget, think about staying at Connect Hotel City Stockholm.
