        "text": "Nordic countries\n\nDenmark (Faroe Islands, Greenland), Finland (Åland), Iceland, Norway, Sami culture, Sweden\n\nBoating • Cuisine • Folk culture • Hiking • Music • Nordic Noir • Right to access • Sauna • Winter\n\nNordic history: • Vikings & Old Norse • Danish Empire • Swedish Empire • Monarchies\n\nThough Norway, Finland and Iceland became independent countries only during the 20th century, the Nordic countries have, in many ways, been forerunners for the creation of the nation-state. Since AD 930, Iceland has had the oldest surviving national parliament (though there were lengthy times when it was either not in session, suspended or had little say in anything). Denmark has been a sovereign kingdom since the 8th century, and its flag was adopted during the 13th century, as the world's first known national flag that is still in use. Sweden has the world's longest continuous census records, started in the 17th century for conscription to the army, as well as the world's oldest central bank, founded in 1668. The Norwegian Eidsvoll Code of 1814, which is still Norway's constitution, was considered to be one of the most democratic constitutions for its time.\n\nPrehistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ice Age traces, Vikings and the Old Norse\n\nThe ice covering the Scandinavian peninsula during the Ice Age began to melt away around 10,000 BCE, with human settlement soon to follow. The first written mentions of the Nordic population were made by Roman historians such as Tacitus. The Goths who replaced the Western Roman Empire had supposed Nordic origin. From the 8th to the 11th century, the Norse became notorious during the Viking Age as pirates, mercenaries and colonists across Europe. Most historical sources about them are either written by their adversaries, or oral tradition written down centuries later.\n\nChristianization of the North was a lengthy process which began in the 9th century, with Saint Ansgar the best-known missionary. Around AD 1000 the first Nordic kings were baptized; Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, Saint Olaf of Norway, and Olof Skötkonung of Sweden. While kings and priests enforced Christianity and Latin script, the Viking raids continued until the late 11th century, and pagan beliefs and runes survived as folklore until modern times; see Nordic folk culture.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Skaraborg history tour\n\nIn Nordic historiography, the Middle Ages and Nordic history (superseding Nordic prehistory) are considered to have begun in the mid-11th century, with the establishment of Christianity, the unification of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and a gradual increase of written records. Most medieval literature is from the 13th century or later, consisting of provincial laws, letters, and chronicles.\n\nThe territories that became Finland were pagan, with few Christian churches, and scarce written records, until Swedish kings went on crusades to Christianize and annex what now is Finland in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Swedes clashed with Russian Orthodox missionaries from Novgorod in Karelia, which has since then remained a borderland between Nordic and Slavic culture.\n\nWith Christianity and monarchy came masonry architecture, which lasted the test of time better than the wooden buildings typical to the Nordic countries. Among the few surviving wooden medieval buildings are Norway's stave churches.\n\nIn 1397, Sweden (which included Finland), Norway and Denmark (which included Iceland) were united under the Kalmar Union. Thereby, all populated territories of the Nordic countries were united under the same crown for a century.\n\nThe Hanseatic League controlled much of Nordic overseas trade during the Middle Ages, and German merchants dominated many of the cities.\n\nEarly modern age\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Early modern Europe, Swedish Empire, Danish Empire\n\nIn the 16th century, Sweden broke away from the Kalmar Union. Denmark revoked Norwegian autonomy in 1536. Swedish and Danish kings enforced the Protestant Reformation, breaking up with the Holy See, and confiscating church property. In Nordic historiography, these events mark the end of the Middle Ages, and the event of the Early Modern Age. To this day, Lutheranism remains the state religion in all Nordic countries, though nowadays they are largely secular societies with only a minority of people attending church regularly.\n\nThis period was marked by rivalry between the Swedish and Danish empires, as well as external enemies; first the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, later the Russian Empire. Borders have changed many times, mostly through war. Much of the Baltic states and northern Germany came under Swedish and Danish rule.\n\nSweden assembled wealth from mining and metalworking (where Walloon metallurgists were instrumental). To secure firewood supply for the industry, the king ordered his scientist to find a way to lessen firewood use in houses. The result was the masonry contra-flow stove, which among the rich was built as cocklestoves (kakelugn). The invention had long-going impact, through changed housing and forest use, by time in much of Europe and North America.\n\nSweden reached the height of its power as the Thirty Years' War ended in 1648, and came to nearly encircle the Baltic Sea. In the 18th century the Nordic countries were rivalled by the rising Russian Empire, which annexed the land around Saint Petersburg, the Baltic States, and later Finland.\n\nDenmark had some small colonies in India (including the Nicobar Islands), West Africa and the Caribbean, with some participation in the Atlantic slave trade. Sweden had Saint-Barthélemy and short-lived colonies in present-day Delaware and West Africa. The only traces of Swedish and Danish rule in these territories are some place names, and some slave forts on the West African coast that were built for the Atlantic slave trade. Greenland and the Faroe Islands continue to be Danish dependencies. The Danish empire came to an end when the Faroes gained full internal self-government in 1948 and Greenland did in 1953.\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile Sweden and Denmark tried to stay out of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden was attacked by Russia in 1808, resulting in Sweden losing its eastern half, Finland, and Denmark was attacked by Britain and joined the French alliance. The Kiel treaty of January 1814 forced Denmark to cede Norway to the Swedish crown, putting an end to its hold on the Scandinavian peninsula. The Norwegians did not like the arrangement and signed the Eidsvoll Code (a new constitution, very radical for its time) on May 17 the same year. During the summer, Sweden invaded Norway and forced it into the personal union as prescribed by the treaty, ending its six months of independence.\n\nUnder pressure from Russia and Germany, a Scandinavian Union was proposed during the mid-19th century, but was never realized. From the 1840s to the 1910s, millions of Nordic people emigrated to the United States; as many as a quarter of the population of Norway and Sweden (more than half of some parishes) found new homes across the Atlantic. They left a mark mostly in the Midwestern states and around the Great Lakes, where some aspects of Nordic culture are still celebrated in things like the name of sports teams. A group of Danish settlers made it as far as California, where they would found the town of Solvang, which remains known today for its Danish bakeries.\n\nWith the exception of the mining and metalworking in Bergslagen, the Nordic countries were among the last in western Europe to industrialize. In the late 19th century, the Swedish government lifted many guild laws and allowed free enterprise, as well as railway expansion. Sweden and Norway used rivers for hydroelectric power, and electrified rapidly in the early 20th century, with infrastructure projects such as the Norrbotten Megasystem around the railway between Luleå and Narvik.\n\nFrom the late 19th to the early 20th century, Nordic explorers revealed the last blank spots on the globe. Finland-Swedish geologist Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld led the first expedition through the Northeastern Passage around Russia in 1878–1880, completing the first circumnavigation of Eurasia; returning through the newly opened Suez Canal. Swedish explorer Sven Hedin finished the charting of Central Asia around 1900. Norwegian mariner Roald Amundsen led the first ship through the Northwestern Passage in 1903, and the first expedition to the South Pole in 1911. His countryman Fridtjof Nansen explored the inner parts of Greenland and Siberia, and used his fame for humanitarian efforts in World War I.\n\nIndependence and World Wars\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil 1905, Sweden and Denmark were the only sovereign Nordic states. While Finland, Iceland and Norway were subjects under the Russian, Danish and Swedish crown respectively, each of them had a flourishing nationalist movement since the mid-19th century, with the rise of vernacular literature, composers such as Edvard Grieg and Jean Sibelius, romanticist art featuring historical scenes and Norse mythology, and an ambition to preserve the rural folk culture which was displaced by a modern urban lifestyle. The world's first living history museums were Skansen in Stockholm, and Norsk Folkemuseum in Oslo. Norway broke away from Sweden in 1905. As the Russian revolution in 1917 allowed Finland to declare independence, a grim civil war followed.\n\nWorld War II divided the Nordic countries. Denmark and Norway were seized by the Germans, and Iceland by the Allies. Finland was attacked by the Soviet Union, and fought it first alone in the Winter War, then with Germany in the Continuation War; preferring the term \"co-belligerent\" instead of \"ally\". However, Finland switched sides towards the end of the war and expelled the Nazis from Finnish territory in the Lapland War, in return for the Soviets agreeing to respect Finnish sovereignty, at the cost of having to cede part of Karelia to the Soviet Union and being made to promise to remain neutral and not join any military alliances. Sweden was nominally neutral, but made several concessions to Germany; exporting iron and other materials, and allowing German troop transitions to Norway and Finland. In the late stage of the war, Sweden launched rescue operations to continental Europe. Denmark distinguished itself by helping its Jewish population largely escape Nazi persecution through a concerted effort of the Danish resistance and neutral Sweden, which received most of the refugees.\n\nIceland was bloodlessly occupied by Britain and later by the United States, with foreign soldiers coming to outnumber the adult male Icelanders; today, many citizens have British or American ancestry. In 1944, Iceland voted for independence, restoring its millennial republican tradition.\n\nPostwar history\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Cold War, Norway, Denmark and Iceland joined NATO, while Sweden and Finland maintained different levels of non-alignment. Finnish President Urho Kekkonen served for 25 years, and was best known for his appeasement policy towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet influence coined the generic term Finlandization, described by cartoonist Kari Suomalainen as \"bowing to the East without mooning the West\". Nordic cooperation developed, with the Nordic Council, a passport union and a common labour market introduced in the 1950s. This allowed Finland to domestically maintain a Western-style democracy and market economy, while also having somewhat cordial relations with the Soviet Union on its border. The young Finnish nation became a forerunner in modern architecture; see Functionalist architecture in Finland.\n\nWhile all Nordic countries remained democratic market economies integrated with the Western world, \"Scandinavian socialism\" and the welfare state reached its apex in the 1980s; while many public services have been privatized since then, taxes in these countries are still among the world's highest. Education and healthcare are free or heavily subsidized. Norway became one of the richest countries in the world (and one of the most expensive for visitors) when large quantities of oil were discovered off its coast, the revenues of which are not used directly, but invested in a state held fund. The Nordic countries would also become bastions of progressive politics, and regularly rank among the highest in gender equality, with the world's highest proportions of women in senior leadership positions, as well as very generous maternity and paternity leave.\n\nIceland famously fought three separate \"cod wars\" against the United Kingdom. These basically consisted of Iceland unilaterally declaring ever larger territorial waters off limits to foreign fishery and then enforcing it with its coast guard. Although Iceland has no military and only a token police force under arms, the small island nation faced down the mighty Royal Navy and won.\n\nWhile Denmark, Sweden and Finland joined the European Union, Finland is the only Nordic country to have adopted the euro. EU accession is a political \"third rail\" in Norway and goes across all other ideological divides and as such coalition agreements usually include a clause not to discuss the issue. Iceland has historically been EU-sceptical, mostly due to fisheries (which are hugely important for the small island nation) and while this looked to be changing in the course of the financial crisis, EU accession is not planned as of 2024. That said, all Nordic countries (but not Greenland) are part of EEA and the Schengen Area, and citizens of all EU countries have the right of abode in all Nordic countries and vice-versa.\n\nThe Sami people have lived in the north since time immemorial, but their land was annexed by the Nordic kingdoms, and they had to wait to the late 20th century to be recognized as a nation, with representation in the Nordic Council. Other now recognised minorities include the Roma people and the Jews. Finland got Jewish and Tatar immigrants through the Russian Empire. While the Nordic countries have always had some migration between them, and immigration of experts from certain European countries was instrumental for the industrialisation, large-scale immigration from other parts of the world came after World War II. Sweden, Norway and Denmark have immigrant communities from Africa and Asia. Immigration to Finland was uncommon until the 1990s.\n\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Finland and Sweden abandoned their long-standing traditions of military neutrality and joined NATO."
