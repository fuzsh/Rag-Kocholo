        "text": "The currency used in Turkey is the Turkish Lira (TL)\n\nThe Turkish Lira, along with the related currencies of Europe and the Middle East, has its roots in the ancient Roman unit of weight known as the Libra which referred to the Troy pound of silver. The Roman libra adoption of the currency spread it throughout Europe and the Near East, where it continued to be used into medieval times. The Turkish Lira, the French Livre, the Italian Lira, and the British Pound are the modern descendants of the ancient currency.\n\nThe 'Pound' is a translated version of the Roman libra. Notice that the word 'Pound' as a unit of weight is still abbreviated as 'lb'. Mind blown!\n\n​\n\nCan you use other currencies in Turkey other than the Lira?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but officially no. Depending on the vendor, you may be able to pay in Euros or USD for certain items such as accommodation, transport and also in some restaurants. It is not a requirement for a business to have to accept any currency other than the Turkish Lira, so make sure you check beforehand that it's OK for them. Generally they wont provide change in another currency, so best you have small notes to make it an easy transaction.\n\n​\n\nConverting your local money into Lira is a lot more favourable on the exchange if doing in Turkey rather than in your home country. Download the XE.com app for up to date rates so you can confidently make your comparisons at the exchange booth. If you can get close to the official rate, then you know you've done well!\n\n​\n\nIf you are not happy with the exchange, you can always exchange in a bank branch, or better still just leave the cash at home and retrieve it directly out of the ATM as many banks these days give very fair exchanges. It would be worth checking in with your local bank beforehand so you know of any hidden fees.\n\n​\n\nMajor port towns in Turkey will have ATMs that are linked to international banking networks, however some of the smaller towns may not even have ATM facilities at all so always prepare a few days ahead.\n\nThese days credit cards showing the Visa or MasterCard symbol are recognised and accepted in most tourist areas, however if travelling off the beaten track, it wouldn't hurt to go old school and have some cash on hand.\n\n​\n\nPlease note that while onboard with us, any extra expenses such as excursions, bar tabs and tips etc will need to be paid in cash and should ideally be in Turkish Lira or Euro.\n\nYour helpful Koda Sail rep will be able to point you in the right direction of where the closest ATM's are along the way so you're not always carrying a lot of cash around for no reason.\n\nCheck xe.com to see how the Lira fares against your home currency.\n\nDepending on your taste, a sailing tour in Europe can be cheap once you are there and not too much money needs to be spent during the week if you didn’t want to.\n\nEating Out: Outside of the many included meals throughout the week, there are opportunities to eat out on the land. The restaurants we recommend are in the price range of €7-30 per meal.\n\n​\n\nGoing Out: If you decide to join the group on our nights out, our Koda Sail reps organise free entries to clubs and nightly drink specials, helping you to save money to be spent elsewhere.\n\n​\n\nThere is also a bar on board the boat that will put on some Happy Hours throughout the week with different specials, allowing you to enjoy a cheaper drink if you wish. A bar tab is run on the boat for the week allowing you to pay in cash at the end. It is visible all week and you can keep track as you go.\n\n​\n\nAs a rough guide for your bar tab on board, €100-150 Euro for the week would get you a beer/wine at lunch and dinner, some drinks in the afternoon on the sun deck and then pre-drinks before heading out, for the 7 days while on the boat.\n\n​\n\nExcursions: If you choose to do any extra excursions we have on offer, you will need to budget for these. To do everything, it generally is around €130-180 per person. These prices are just a guide as excursions change from season to season.\n\n​​\n\nTipping: Tipping is not compulsory and it’s entirely up to you if you decide to give extra to your Koda Sail crew. It’s definitely not expected, but is very much appreciated.\n\nYou will see the Koda Sail team always goes above and beyond to ensure you have the best week of your life on our tours. It’s something we pride ourselves on.\n\nYou will have the opportunity to show your gratitude to your crew at the end of the tour.\n\nThe amount you tip is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline we recommend;\n\n€10 per WEEK, per crew member on board.\n\n€5 per DAY for your Koda Sail tour manager"
