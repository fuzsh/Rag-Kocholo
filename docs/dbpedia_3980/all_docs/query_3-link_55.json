        "text": "The Italian currency is the Euro (EUR). The euro is the official currency of 19 of the 27 European Union countries, collectively known as the Eurozone. It replaced the Italian Lira in 2002.\n\nIn Italy, you’ll find banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 Euros, and coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, as well as 1 and 2 Euro coins.\n\nWhen traveling to Italy, it’s important to have a basic understanding of the Italian currency. This article will let you know what to expect and how to exchange your currency so you can ensure that your trip goes smoothly and you’re able to purchase the things you need while you’re in Italy.\n\nHistorical Journey of the Italian Currency\n\nItalian currency has a long and interesting history that dates back to ancient times. The first Italian coins were minted by the Etruscans in the 6th century BC. These coins were made of bronze and were used for trade and commerce.\n\nOver the centuries, Italian currency evolved and changed hands many times. The Roman Empire introduced the denarius, a silver coin that was used throughout the empire. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Italian currency was dominated by the Byzantine Empire, which introduced the solidus, a gold coin that was used throughout Europe.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Italian city-states began to mint their coins. These coins were often decorated with images of local rulers or landmarks. The most famous of these coins was the florin, which was minted in Florence in the 13th century. The florin became the standard for European coinage and was used for trade throughout the continent.\n\nItalian Lira\n\nThe Italian lira, used from 1861 to 2002, was introduced by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1807, equal to the French franc. It became the currency of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 and was also used in Albania from 1941 to 1943. The lira, subdivided into 100 centesimi, evolved from the libra of the Carolingian system, which also influenced the French livre and the pound sterling.\n\nThe lira underwent significant changes over the years. Initially, it replaced various regional currencies. In 1865, Italy joined the Latin Monetary Union, equating the lira to the French, Belgian, and Swiss francs, with the U.S. dollar being worth about 5.18 lire until 1914. World War I disrupted this system, leading to inflation in Italy. Mussolini’s regime in 1926 pegged the lira to sterling and later to the U.S. dollar, but these rates changed, particularly during and after World War II.\n\nPost-war, Italy faced high inflation, leading to suggestions to redenominate the lira, which were eventually abandoned in favor of adopting the euro. The euro replaced the lira in 1999 as the official currency, with a conversion rate of €1 = Lit 1,936.27, and the lira ceased to be legal tender in 2002.\n\nThe lira had no standard symbol, but various abbreviations like Lit., L., ₤, or £ were used. Coins and banknotes of the lira underwent several changes, reflecting Italy’s economic and political shifts. Notable coins include the bi-metallic 500 and 1,000 lire, and the first coin featuring braille. The Bank of Italy and the government issued various banknotes, with the last series circulating until the euro’s introduction.\n\nThe euro’s introduction marked the end of the lira, with the Bank of Italy exchanging old lira notes and coins until December 6, 2011. The shift to the euro was significant, reflecting Italy’s economic integration into the European Union and the end of a currency that had been a central part of Italian life and history for over a century.\n\nEuro\n\nItaly adopted the euro on January 1, 2002, following a three-year transitional period where it was used as ‘book money’. During the initial phase, both the euro and the Italian lira were legal tender until February 28, 2002. The Banca d’Italia continued to exchange Italian lira banknotes and coins until February 29, 2012.\n\nEuro coins\n\nThe euro, introduced in 1999, is the official currency of the Eurozone, consisting of 20 member countries. It is divided into eight coin denominations, ranging from one cent to two euros, each featuring a common reverse side depicting a map of Europe.\n\nHowever, the obverse side varies among member countries, showcasing unique designs. In addition to Eurozone members, four European microstates (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) use the euro with their own designed coins. The coins are minted at national mints, adhering to strict quotas, while the European Central Bank manages the common side.\n\nOver the years, the euro’s design has evolved, with changes in 2007 reflecting the EU’s enlargement and updates in 2017 for some denominations. The euro’s introduction aimed to foster economic and monetary union, contributing to stability and collaboration among member states.\n\nThe coins incorporate security features, and their design considers tactile elements for the visually impaired. While national sides of regular coins can be updated every 15 years, commemorative coins may vary more frequently. As of 2023, 24 countries issue euro coins with their national sides, reflecting the diversity within the Eurozone.\n\nEuro bills\n\nEuro banknotes, the common currency of the eurozone, have evolved since their 1999 inception. Initially, under ES1, these €5 to €500 notes featured a uniform design with the European flag, a map, and “euro” in Latin and Greek.\n\nThe designs, by Robert Kalina, resulted from a 1996 competition. ES1, made of pure cotton, excluded non-EU Cyprus and Malta. ES2, or Europa series, introduced size changes and enhanced durability with updated security features. Reinhold Gerstetter redesigned the notes, featuring Mario Draghi’s signature post-March 2012.\n\nAnticipated in 2024, the third series will redesign notes based on public-voted themes. Security features include confidential elements like holograms and watermarks. The Europa series introduced Europa’s face, reflecting EU expansion and adding Bulgaria’s Cyrillic alphabet. Circulating since 2013, it phased out the €500 note due to concerns about criminal use.\n\nSecurity features include watermarks, holograms, color-changing ink, and more, with consultation for the visually impaired. A 2021 plan outlines the next redesign with potential themes like “European culture.” The ECB monitors euro banknote circulation and stock, ensuring integrity since its 2002 introduction. The euro’s history involves expansion, formalized political authority through the Lisbon Treaty, and usage across multiple EU countries. The seven denominations feature stylized historical European architectural illustrations on both sides.\n\nInflation and Buying Power of Euro\n\nAccording to Trading Economics, between 1960 and 2022, Italy’s inflation rate ranged from -0.1% to 21.1%. In 2022, it was 8.2%. The average yearly inflation rate during this period was 5.8%, leading to an overall price increase of 2,904.77%. This means an item costing 100 euros in 1960 would cost 3,004.77 euros in early 2023. By October 2023, the year-over-year inflation rate had dropped to 1.7%.\n\nIn November 2023, Italy’s annual inflation further decreased to 0.7%, the lowest since February 2021 and below the anticipated 0.8%. This is part of a broader disinflation trend in the Euro Area, influenced by high base effects and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) prolonged restrictive monetary policy. Net inflation in Italy also decreased to 3.6%. Significant price reductions occurred in energy, food, and various services. Italian consumer prices fell by 0.5% from the previous month, continuing a downward trend.\n\nThe Euro Area’s annual inflation rate also decreased to 2.4% in November 2023, the lowest since July 2021. Slower price increases were seen in services, non-energy industrial goods, and food, alcohol, and tobacco. Energy prices slightly declined. The annual core inflation in the Euro Area was confirmed at 3.6%. ECB President Lagarde indicated that inflation might increase in December 2023 due to base effects for energy costs. For 2024, a slower decline in inflation is expected due to additional base effects and the end of fiscal measures to mitigate the impact of energy price shocks.\n\nCurrency Usage in Italy\n\nIn Italy, many small businesses and markets may not accept credit or debit cards. However, major towns and cities generally have no problem accepting card payments. It’s always a good idea to carry some cash with you, especially if you plan on traveling outside of the major cities or venturing into the countryside. ATMs are widely available in Italy, and you can withdraw Euros using your debit or credit card.\n\nIs USD Accepted in Italy?\n\nIf you are planning to visit Italy, you might be wondering whether you can use US dollars instead of the Italian currency. While some places may accept USD, it is always better to have Euros in hand.\n\nWhile a few places like popular tourist spots, big hotels, and international shops might take US dollars (USD), it’s rare and not recommended to rely on this. The exchange rate for USD in these places is usually not as good as at banks or currency exchange services. Travelers to Italy are advised to use Euros for their purchases, either in cash or with credit/debit cards.\n\nExchanging Currency in Italy\n\nOne of the easiest ways to exchange currency in Italy is to use an ATM.
