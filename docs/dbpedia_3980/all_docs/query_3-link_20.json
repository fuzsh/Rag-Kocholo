Israel's currency was called a lira until 1980.- A different lira was the pre-Euro currency of Italy. Italy's economy after World War 2 did not maintain the stability of the lira, and inflation raised its exchange rate in relation to other currencies, raised to 500 or 600 per USD in the late 1940s. At the time of the Euro's adoption, the exchange rate was 1937.27 lire to the Euro.- Currencies related to the Italian lira were those of Malta, Vatican City, and San Marino.",
