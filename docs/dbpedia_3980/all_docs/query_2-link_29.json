        "text": "Court Staff, Probation Staff and Court-Ordered Mediation\n\nIf an interpreter is needed during business hours, court and probation personnel need to email all interpreter requests to the Operations Team with the county name in the subject line. Court and probation personnel should not be contacting the interpreters directly and scheduling interpreter services. The only exception is for unplanned probation needs outside of normal business hours.\n\nThe initial request needs to contain all the following information:\n\nLanguage\n\nDate\n\nStart time of all court ordered meetings/hearings or probation activities\n\nName\n\nCase Number\n\nCharges\n\nCourtroom #\n\nHearing Type\n\nJudge's Name\n\nAttorney's Name and/or PO's Name\n\nMeeting Type (PSI, PDI, FTM…)\n\nExpected Duration\n\nAddress where the interpreter needs to go\n\nContact person info\n\nCourt personnel should follow this formal request process even if the judge or clerk magistrate asked the interpreter on the record if they are available for the next court date. This will ensure the Language Access Program can confirm an interpreter has been scheduled and ensure they are paid for their services. ​\n\nAttorneys\n\nThe Language Access Program does not pay interpreters used to facilitate communication between an attorney and client outside of the hearing. Interpreters can assist with brief conversations if time allows. As a rule, attorneys should contract with interpreters when they need to meet with their clients to discuss their case, court processes, and strategy. Use the Statewide Register of Interpreters to reach out to the interpreters for their current rates and availability.\n\n“To address these needs, the Nebraska Legislature, under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 and LB1014, set aside $500,000 in federal funds for Fiscal Years 2022-23 and 2023-24 to reimburse expenses incurred in the provision of qualified, licensed sign language interpreters (whether on-site or remote) throughout the state (including Lincoln and Omaha) to provide effective communication access services between attorneys and deaf, deafblind, or hard of hearing individuals outside of the courtroom.” Click here for more information or contact the Nebraska Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.\n\nMental Health Board Hearings, Non-Court Ordered Mediation and State agencies\n\nThe Language Access Program does not pay for the interpreter when they are needed for Mental Health Board hearings, non-court ordered mediation or by other state agencies. Use the Statewide Register of Interpreters to reach out to the interpreters for their current rates and availability.\n\nWorkers Compensation Court\n\nThe Language Access Program will pay for the interpreter, but it is the employer’s obligation to schedule the interpreter. Use the Statewide Register of Interpreters to find and secure an interpreter. Please note that the Nebraska Supreme Court rule on interpreter payment rate must be adhered to, otherwise payment may be denied."
