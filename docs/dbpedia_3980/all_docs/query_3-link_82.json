        "text": "San Marino (SM/SMR) was founded, according to legend, in 301.\n\nSan Marino has used the Lira for its monetary system since the Middle Ages, including the Italian States Lira (XITL) before Italy was united, and the Italian Lira (ITL) since then. San Marino also issues numerous Lira (SML) coins for numismatic purposes.\n\nSan Marino began to issue its own coins only after Italian unification in 1860. San Marino and Italy adopted the Euro (EUR) on January 1, 1999 with 1 Euro equal to 1936.27 Italian Lira. Euro banknotes and coins, issued by the European Central Bank, began circulating in San Marino on January 1, 2002. Although San Marino is not part of the European Union, its Euro coins have full legal tender status in European Union countries."
