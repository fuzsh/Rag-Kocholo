        "text": "The Italian Lira was the official currency of Italy before the country adopted the Euro. It was in use from 1861 to 2002.\n\nThe Italian Lira was introduced after the unification of Italy in 1861. It was replaced by the Euro on January 1, 2002, when Italy, along with several other European countries, adopted the common currency.\n\nSubunits\n\nThe Italian Lira was initially divided into 100 centesimi, this subdivision was abolished however after World War II.\n\nCoins and Banknotes\n\nThe Italian Lira had various denominations of coins and banknotes. Coins were issued in centesimi and Lire, while banknotes were issued in various denominations.\n\nEuro Adoption\n\nItaly adopted the Euro on January 1, 2002. From this date, the Italian Lira ceased to be legal tender, and all transactions switched to the Euro.\n\nSince the adoption of the Euro, the Italian Lira is no longer in circulation, and any remaining banknotes and coins are considered collector's items. The Euro is now the official currency used in Italy.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nThe exchange rate at which the Italian Lira was replaced by the Euro was fixed at 1 Euro = 1,936.27 Italian Lira."
