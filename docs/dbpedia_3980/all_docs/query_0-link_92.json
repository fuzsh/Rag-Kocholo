During his briefing, he told participants that it is important to understand the Macro-Economic Reform Program Policy holistically rather than in isolation. We have thoroughly evaluated what needs to be done to bring about development in Medemer, he noted. When we speak of ensuring prosperity in the country, PM Abiy told stakeholders, we mean by development as espoused by the Medemer-driven comprehensive roadmap. Our thinking is geared towards bringing about a futuristic, forward-looking development in Ethiopia, he said. In this regard, it is incumbent upon us to holistically understand the major pillars and foundational ideals underpinning development in Medemer.\n\nThe five foundational ideals of development in Medemer, according to Premiere Abiy, are: (1) Unity or Synergy; (2) Inclusiveness and Equity; (3) Innovative Approach; (4) Good Governance; and (5) Peace and Stability. These ideals, as outlined in the Medemer roadmap, also have four major underlying principles, the Premiere added. The four major principles mentioned during his address were Entertaining new ideas, Acceleration of key sectors, Implementation or Walking the Talk and Transformation\n\nIn order to fully implement these pivotal principles towards holistic and resilient development, it is imperative that leveraging socio-cultural capital, building new things in key sectors, and leapfrogging are the methodical compasses in the how of reform’s implementation, PM Abiy noted. These approaches, in turn, are buttressed by three key enablers, including early education, conducive policy, and funding, he elucidated.\n\nAccording to the Premiere, the investment gap, infrastructure gap, low institutional capacity, mounting debts, and shortage of foreign exchange are the challenges that plague the full implementation of the reform process and need to be addressed effectively. The Premier stressed that the Reform Programme is pro-poor and focused on supporting the most vulnerable.\n\nUnderscoring the critical role stakeholders could continually play in its fruition, PM Abiy stated that the success of these reforms depends on all stakeholders collaboratively increasing productivity, exports, and revenue. Law enforcement agencies are mandated to take action against malicious traders who artificially manipulate prices, the PM said.\n\nAs per the Macro-Economic Reform Program Policy Statement issued last month, the recently approved second phase of the Homegrown Economic Reform Program (HGER 2.0) reaffirms the government’s commitment to completing the remaining macroeconomic reforms.\n\nThroughout the reform process, the government has reiterated its commitment to implement active measures to address potential good governance concerns and criminal activities. In tandem with this, necessary measures will also be undertaken to protect vulnerable members of society from the short-term negative impacts of the reform.\n\nIn the same token, the economic reform agenda will lay the foundation for strong, private sector-led, inclusive economic growth and job creation. High and stable economic growth and maintaining single-digit inflation are among the major goals to be achieved during the implementation period of the program.\n\nPresident Sahle-Work and Prime Minister Abiy Instruct New Ambassadors to Safeguard National Interests\n\nEthiopia’s 24 newly appointed ambassadors concluded their intensive three-week training program with significant engagements with President Sahle-Work Zewde and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.\n\nAccordingly, on Thursday (August 1), in a solemn ceremony, the ambassadors took their oath in the presence of President Sahle-Work Zewde, the President of the Federal Supreme Court, Tewodros Mihret, the State Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Mesganu Arga, and Ambassador Birtukan Ayano, along with other senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nDuring the occasion, the ambassadors pledged to uphold their country’s national interests and perform their duties with the utmost diligence.\n\nDelivering her remarks, President Sahle-Work congratulated the ambassadors, highlighting the honor and responsibility of representing Ethiopia. She noted that all the appointees are seasoned career diplomats, a decision that came to fruition by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who recognized their extensive experience in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its overseas missions. This experience, she remarked, prepares them well to navigate the complexities of the global diplomatic landscape.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Ambassador Taye Atske-Selassie also extended his congratulations. He emphasized the need to be innovative in addressing the dynamic nature of international relations, whether in bilateral or multilateral contexts.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the ambassadors’ ability to advance Ethiopia’s national interests, drawing on their considerable experience.\n\nEarlier that week, on Wednesday (July 31), Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed met with the newly appointed ambassadors to conclude their training, covering a wide range of topics, including national, regional, continental, and international issues pertinent to Ethiopia’s interests, such as economic diplomacy, Ethiopia’s role in multilateral forums, diaspora policy, and media relations.\n\nThe Prime Minister underscored the importance of promoting and protecting Ethiopia’s national interests and encouraged the ambassadors to execute their responsibilities with excellence.\n\nEthiopia’s Role in Combating Terrorism in the HoA Region: Somalia a Case in point\n\nEthiopia is tied by language, culture, ethnicity, and natural resources with all its neighboring countries. This reality has made Ethiopia adopt a foreign policy that prioritizes safeguarding peace and security in the region. Its efforts over the years in maintaining stability in the region have yielded positive outcomes.\n\nOne good example is its support to the brotherly people of Somalia in their struggle for Somalia’s sustainable peace and security. Assisting the establishment of a stable government was the priority, and this was successfully achieved with the involvement of other neighboring countries and the regional organization, IGAD. Yet, the challenge has persisted and required not only diplomatically but also militarily, which Ethiopia successfully delivered.\n\nIn 2006, based on the invitation from the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, Ethiopia was able to get in Somalia and succeed in ousting the radical Islamist movement, the Union of Islamic Courts, helping Somalia to restore relative peace and security. Again in 2012, when Al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgent group Al-Shabab was reinforced, Ethiopian forces, together with allies, have expelled Al-Shabab from South and Central Somalia. Its coordination and effort with other troop-contributing countries have helped the government of Somalia to enhance its capacity and weaken Al-Shabab.\n\nFor three decades, Ethiopia has always been a troop-contributing country bilaterally and within AMISOM and ATMIS, managing and responding to counterterrorism efforts. Similarly, Ethiopia advocated for Somalia at regional, continental, and international levels diplomatically in supporting predictable and sustainable financing for AMISOM and later for ATMIS operations, along with mobilizing assistance in the state-building process of the country.\n\nSince 1991, Ethiopia has unequivocally operated a principled policy towards Somalia, which is creating a peaceful Somalia for the benefit of its own people, Ethiopia, and the region. This was also reflected recently when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed addressed the 36th regular session of the House of People’s Representatives last month.\n\nThe Prime Minister recalled the brotherly relations and cooperation with Somalia, indicating the sacrifices paid by Ethiopian soldiers in Somalia to ensure the peace and stability of the country, adding Ethiopia not only respects Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity but also strongly desires its peace. The Prime Minister concluded his remark by stressing that Ethiopia’s policy towards neighboring countries is based on collaboration and mutual development.\n\nEthiopia was shocked by the disturbing news of the heinous terrorist attack by al-Shabab on Lido Beach in Mogadishu on Friday (August 2). Prime Minister Abiy immediately expressed his solidarity with the people of Somalia, conveying deep sadness over the tragic loss of lives and the injuries sustained in the horrific attack. He extended thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families, and the people of Somalia during this difficult time.\n\nThe recent attack by the terrorist group Al-Shabab once again highlights how deadly and dangerous the group is. The threat posed by Al-Shabab extends beyond Somalia’s borders, making it crucial for regional actors and international partners to coordinate efforts in countering their terrorist acts. Ethiopia remains committed to standing with the people of Somalia in their fight against terrorism, recognizing that the peace of Somalia is directly tied to the peace of Ethiopia.\n\nAfrican Union Adopts Coffee as a Strategic Anchor Commodity in AU Agenda 2063\n\nA press conference aimed at unveiling the outcome of the G25 Kampala Declaration and its subsequent adoption by the African Union was held on Thursday (August 1) at Eilily International Hotel in Addis Ababa.\n\nThe press conference was attended by high-ranking officials including Girma Amente, Ethiopian Minister of Agriculture and Chairman of the Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO), Ambassador Josefa Sacko, AU’s Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy, and Sustainable Environment (ARBE), and Ambassador Solomon Rutega, Secretary General of IACO.\n\nThe initiative to elevate coffee to a strategic commodity commenced with the Kampala Declaration, a pivotal document arising from the G-25 Coffee Summit held on August 8, 2023, in Kampala, Uganda. The gathering, which convened under the theme of “Transforming African Coffee Sector through Value Addition,” adopted a Kampala Declaration, which was officially recognized during the 37th Session of the African Union Summit held in February 2024 in Addis Ababa.\n\nThe declaration aspires to unlock Africa’s tremendous potential in coffee production through economic empowerment and competitiveness. Major objectives of the declaration include supporting research in coffee value addition to enable innovation and development of new products, generating new knowledge on best practices and improved technologies, and undertaking studies on the production of coffee through access to finance for coffee value addition projects, among others. Furthermore, the trade of coffee under the framework of the AfCFTA is a crucial component of the aforementioned declaration.\n\nThe aforementioned press conference was crucial to announce the outcome of the G25 Kampala Declaration which was adopted by the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and governments. The declaration includes a proposal to elevate coffee as a strategic commodity in AU Agenda 2063. It also includes the recommendation to designate the Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) as a specialized agency of the African Union.\n\nDuring the media briefing, IACO Chairman Girma Amente stressed that the decision to adopt coffee as a strategic anchor commodity and the inclusion of the Inter-Africa Coffee Organization (IACO) as a specialized agency of the African Union is a historic milestone. He further noted that Ethiopia is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with a per capita consumption of coffee of about 2/3 kg per person.\n\nAU Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy, and Sustainable Development (ARBE) Commissioner Josefa Sacko, on her part, underscored the need to transform products in the continent as the recent decision is a pilot initiative for other products in Africa. The Commissioner hailed Ethiopia as the home and backbone of Coffee Arabica.\n\nIACO Secretary General, Ambassador Solomon S. Rutega, emphasized that the vision to transform the African coffee sector through value addition needs political commitment for the sector. He noted that coffee is the second-largest commodity in the world next to oil.\n\nWhile Africa is a birthplace of coffee and makes up 12 percent of the overall global production of coffee beans, the sector is still hampered by low productivity and production, inequality in the coffee value chain, loss of economic benefits associated with low consumption, and the adverse impact of climate change. For instance, Ethiopia exports 99% of its coffee without adding value depending on the demand of the importing countries.\n\nTherefore, the adoption of coffee as a strategic anchor commodity and designation of the Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) with the broader objective of transforming the coffee sector on the continent is expected to positively impact the lives of millions of households dependent on the sector.\n\nEthiopia Celebrates the 50th Anniversary of Lucy’s Discovery\n\nEthiopia recently celebrated a significant milestone: the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, the renowned hominid fossil that has become a symbol of the country’s contribution to the understanding of human evolution.\n\nThe anniversary is reflective of the importance of Lucy’s discovery not only for its scientific value but also for its role in enhancing Ethiopia’s global image and tourism appeal.\n\nLucy, discovered on November 24, 1974, in Hadar, Afar Region, by a team led by American anthropologist Donald Johanson, is estimated to be 3.2 million years old. This fossil has provided invaluable insights into human evolution and has cemented Ethiopia’s place in the history of scientific research.\n\nThe ninth Eastern Africa Association for Paleoanthropology and Paleontology (EAAPP) conference held in Addis Ababa at the Adwa Memorial Museum featured a series of events, including participation from the Arizona State University’s Institute of Anthropology, complemented by a photo exhibition and visits to various historical sites in Addis Ababa, showcasing Ethiopia’s rich heritage.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed, addressing the anniversary celebrations, stressed that Lucy’s (Dinknesh) discovery has solidified Ethiopia’s role as a central hub for the study of human evolution and has affirmed Africa’s status as the cradle of humanity.\n\nThe Prime Minister stated that Lucy’s discovery was a groundbreaking event that captivated both the scientific community and the world at large, providing invaluable insights into the evolution of life on Earth. He acknowledged Ethiopia’s extensive contributions to our understanding of human history and its role in the development of ancient technology and culture.\n\nIn his remarks, Prime Minister Abiy also highlighted ongoing government initiatives aimed at promoting tourism, such as the Dine for Sheger, Dine for the Nation, and Dine for the Generation projects. These efforts are designed to showcase Ethiopia’s natural and cultural attractions, with additional projects in the pipeline to further develop the tourism sector.\n\nProfessor Yohannes Haile-Selassie, a renowned anthropologist and Director of the Institute of Anthropology at Arizona State University, who attended the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, highlighted the importance of the anniversary for Ethiopia. He emphasized that the successful organization of the conference and related events not only celebrated Ethiopia’s scientific achievements but also served to promote the country’s tourism resources on a global scale. The visibility and attention garnered through these celebrations are expected to enhance Ethiopia’s international reputation and attract more visitors.\n\nThe presence of distinguished researchers was noted as crucial for boosting Ethiopia’s global visibility and reinforcing its historical prominence. The celebration of the 50th anniversary of Lucy’s discovery has not only celebrated a pivotal scientific achievement but also provided a platform for Ethiopia to highlight its rich historical and cultural heritage.\n\nEthiopia-China Business Forum Held in Addis Ababa\n\nOn Thursday (August 1), the Ethiopia-China Business Forum was successfully held at Skylight Hotel, Addis Ababa. The forum was co-organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of FDRE and the Ethiopia-China Friendship and Cooperation Committee in collaboration with the Ethiopian Investment Commission and the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and Sectoral Association.\n\nWith the aim of promoting business-to-business exchanges and fostering economic cooperation between Ethiopia and China, the Forum brought together more than 250 participants of Ethiopian high-level officials, the business communities of the two countries, and members of the Ethiopia-China Friendship and Cooperation Committee, as well as representatives from various Chinese provinces and leaders of Chinese cities such as Rizhao and Jiaxing.\n\nThe forum was graced with the attendance of Ambassador Mesagnu Arga, State Minister of Foreign Affairs; Yasmin Wohabrebbi, State Minister of Trade and Regional Integration; Wondimu Seta, State Minister of Urban and Infrastructure; Fiseha Yitagesu, CEO of Ethiopian Industrial Parks Development Corporation; Betty Xu, Chairperson of the Ethiopia-China Friendship and Cooperation Committee; Zhang Dianhu, Deputy Mayor of Rizhao City; Zhang Renghui, Vice Chairman of the Jiaxing Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee; and Aynalem Abayneh, Vice President of the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and Sectoral Associations, who delivered speeches in the opening session.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Ambassador Mesagnu Arga highlighted that the recently signed All-Weather Strategic Partnership between Ethiopia and China has created new opportunities for both countries’ business communities. He noted that trade between Ethiopia and China totals around $5 billion, with China’s foreign direct investment reaching $4 billion.\n\nHe emphasized Ethiopia’s commitment to improving the business environment through economic reforms and encouraged joint efforts to maximize investment and trade potential. Additionally, he pointed out the rich production capacities of Chinese cities like Rizhao and Jiaxing, and Ethiopia’s interest in fostering business exchanges with these cities.\n\nYasmin Wohabrebbi, State Minister of Trade and Regional Integration, stated that the Business Forum with the Chinese business community aligns with Ethiopia’s ongoing economic reforms. She highlighted significant changes, including allowing foreign investors in previously restricted sectors like export and retail trade, and the revision of the foreign exchange regime, which aims to attract foreign currency and benefit both investors and the Ethiopian economy.\n\nFiseha Yitagesu, CEO of Ethiopian Industrial Parks Development Corporation, emphasized efforts to boost Chinese investor participation in Ethiopia’s industrial parks, highlighting institutional reforms, one-stop shop services, and incentives like duty-free imports.\n\nBetty Xu, Chairperson of the Ethiopia-China Friendship and Cooperation Committee, underscored the shared industrialization goals and investment opportunities in sectors like mining and manufacturing.\n\nAdding upon what was said, Zhang Dianhu and Zhang Renghui noted that Ethiopia’s recent economic reforms, including foreign exchange changes, will enhance Chinese investment. Aynalem Abayneh, Vice President of the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce, highlighted Ethiopia’s strategic location and government efforts to attract foreign direct investment.\n\nAt the business and investment forum, representatives from the Ethiopian Investment Commission and Industrial Parks Development Corporation highlighted Ethiopia’s investment opportunities and strong ties with China. The event included government-to-business and business-to-business sessions focusing on sectors like mining, renewable energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.\n\nAn interactive panel on mining, led by State Minister Million Mathewos, connected Ethiopian opportunities with Chinese investors. The forum also featured the launch of the Ethiopia-China Friendship Committee’s Light-up Villages program and the signing of 13 business agreements with Chinese enterprises.\n\nPrior to the main forum, a business-to-government meeting was held on Wednesday (July 31), 2024, at Skylight Hotel, where Ethiopia and China discussed enhancing investment in agriculture, energy, and other sectors. The Ethiopian Investment Commission and the Ethiopia-China Friendship and Cooperation Committee signed an MOU on Joint Investment, Promotion and Retention.

The reform, which is based on the Home-Grown Economic Reform Plan (HGER 2.0), aims to stabilize and modernize the macro-economy, encourage foreign investment, encourage job creation, strengthen the government’s institutional capacity, and accelerate economic growth.\n\nFollowing the government’s announcement, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) also announced on Monday (July 29), that it has moved from the National Bank’s pegged exchange rate, which it has been in use for a long time, to the floating exchange rate. This historic shift in Ethiopia’s currency policy attempts to address multiple economic problems concurrently: a scarcity of foreign currency, significantly higher parallel market foreign exchange rates and high inflation. A statement released by the NBE on Monday (July 29), acknowledges that the new exchange rate is challenging in many aspects but critically necessary to avoid problems caused by the fixed exchange rate system.\n\nAccording to the NBE statement, the pegged foreign exchange rate system in Ethiopia, initially designed to ensure stability and low inflation, has led to high inflation and illicit exports of Ethiopia’s resources, causing foreign exchange earnings to diverge from the banking system and domestic economy, affecting productive sectors and undermining policy efforts to expand exports and attract foreign investment. In summarizing the importance of the FX reform, the statement says, the “FX reform is essential to address acute foreign exchange shortages, enhance export competitiveness, attract FDI, and complement multiple other macroeconomic reforms that are being put in place to enhance conditions for private sector enterprises to grow and thrive in the Ethiopian economy.”\n\nAccording to the NBE, key measures following the introduction of the new FX system, include transitioning to a market-based exchange regime where banks can freely negotiate foreign currency rates, with NBE intervention only as needed. Exporters and commercial banks will now retain foreign exchange, which will increase FX supplies to the private sector. Import restrictions have been removed, and the market for goods and services imports has been liberalized. Exporters can retain up to 50% of their foreign exchange proceeds, while and companies operating in Special Economic Zones can retain all their foreign exchange earnings.\n\nAdditionally, the previous allocation system based on waiting lists has been abolished. Non-bank foreign exchange bureaus will now trade currency at market rates, and forthcoming regulations will lift restrictions on franco valuta imports.\n\nAdditional changes include simplified rules for foreign currency account management and transactions, including relaxed restrictions on the allocation of foreign currency to travellers. Moreover, rules on foreign borrowing for private entities and banks have been improved. Upon its launch, the securities market will be open to foreign investors,. Restrictions on the amount of foreign currency travelers can carry have also been relaxed.\n\nThe new market-based system is expected to benefit key sectors such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, services, and tourism, help repatriate foreign earnings, boost import-substituting industries, and enhance Ethiopia’s attractiveness to foreign investors. This shift will also support broader macroeconomic reforms aimed at private sector growth.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, the government has implemented several measures, including temporary subsidies for essential imports like fuel, fertilizers, medicine, and edible oil to mitigate price impacts. Financial support will be increased for those affected by high inflation, including salary supplements for civil servants and expanded funding for the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). External debt service relief is being secured to maintain budgetary allocations for social and capital spending. The NBE has introduced new monetary policy tools to control inflation, and the Ministry of Finance is strengthening the revenue base to avoid inflationary financing.\n\nAdditionally, a substantial financial package of $10.7 billion from international partners, including the IMF and World Bank, will support these reform efforts, marking the largest coordinated support commitment for Ethiopia to date.\n\nIn line with this, on Tuesday (July 30), the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved a comprehensive financial support package for Ethiopia. This package includes Ethiopia’s First Sustainable and Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation, comprising a $1 billion grant and a $500 million concessional credit from the International Development Association (IDA). As a key development finance provider for Ethiopia, the World Bank Group currently offers over $2 billion annually in concessional financing. IDA commitments currently total $15.5 billion, with $7 billion available for disbursement.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC) has an investment portfolio of $320 million, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provides $1.15 billion in guarantees. Over the next three years, the World Bank plans to support Ethiopia’s goal of becoming a middle-income country with $6 billion in new IDA commitments, $2.1 billion in IFC investments, and expanded MIGA engagement, totaling over $16.6 billion in undisbursed and future commitments. Including the package from the WB group, the overall support from the WB, IMF, debt restructuring, and bilateral support exceeds $27 billion.\n\nThe foreign exchange reform, combined with other macroeconomic policies and international support, presents Ethiopia with a unique opportunity to accelerate its growth and development. In the near term, the National Bank of Ethiopia will focus on a smooth transition to the new exchange rate system while maintaining price stability and enhancing regulatory and supervision efforts.\n\nEthiopia-China Conduct Business Forum in Addis Ababa\n\nThe Ethiopia-China Business Forum was held on Wednesday (July 30) at Skylight Hotel in Addis Ababa.
