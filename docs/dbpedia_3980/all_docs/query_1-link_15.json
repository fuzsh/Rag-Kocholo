When doubled as a \"gateway\" to the Near East, its significance can hardly be exaggerated. This has been shown by the political concern and economic assistance of countries as varied as Italy and Great Britain (the former colonial rulers), the United States, and also the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Indeed, with its relatively small and semi-arid territory and a modest-sized population, Somalia has perhaps received more international economic and technical assistance per capita than most developing countries. Its attraction polit¬ ically for both East and West, and more recently for the Arab world, probably ranks equally high. Still, we really know very little about this country. Even while this dictionary on Somalia was being written, Somali students were being sent to the countryside by the government to teach the population and undertake Somalia's first complete census. Thus--as in many developing countries of the world--we do not know with any great certainty how many Somalis there are in the Republic, or exactly where they live, or, with the statistical precision desirable for ad¬ ministrative and development purposes, their occupations and income. This is enough to show the importance of a book that gathers together much of the existing information and in¬ tegrates it in such a readable fashion. It is also most wel¬ come that Mrs. Castagno should have gone into the very rich cultural and social life of the Somali groups, as well as the intricate relations within this otherwise quite unified people. Finally, like the Somalis themselves, she has not forgotten to tell us about parts of the ethnic family living outside the frontiers of the present state. If we glance at the list of works on Somalia in the excellent bibliography at the end of this volume, we can see that hundreds of authors and research workers from many vii\n\ncountries have devoted their efforts to studying various as¬ pects of Somali history. One of the leading American writers on Somalia was Dr. Alphonso A. Castagno, who was, from 1965 until his death in 1973, Director of the African Studies Center at Boston University. Professor Castagno spent some eighteen months in Somalia during 1957-1958 and made numer¬ ous shorter visits to the country--most recently in 1971 when he had the unique opportunity of interviewing the President of Somalia's Supreme Revolutionary Council, General Mohamed Siad Barre. Dr. Castagno's Somalia, published by Interna¬ tional Conciliation in 1959, and his many articles on Somalia's political development, educational system, strategic situation, and boundary problems helped to make the country better known in the United States. Originally, it had been expected that Dr. Castagno would co-author this dictionary with Mrs. Castagno. Regretably, not long after beginning work on the volume, he passed away. The bulk of the material found in the diction¬ ary was therefore compiled by Mrs. Castagno. Having lived in Somalia in 1957-1958 as well and having worked as a free¬ lance writer, editor, and book reviewer over the intervening years, she was well equipped to carry on the task of com¬ pleting the book. It is due to her efforts that Scarecrow Press can publish the dictionary, which is an important con¬ tribution to those who want to know more about the history of the Horn of Africa and the Somali people.\n\nJon Woronoff Series Editor\n\nviii\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND NOTES\n\nIn compiling this Historical Dictionary of Somalia, I have been fortunate to have the advice and encouragement of a number of friends. Three who are well known for their scholarly works on Somalia must be thanked by name: Dr. I. M. Lewis of the University of London, Department of An¬ thropology; Dr. Lee V. Cassanelli of the University of Penn¬ sylvania, Department of History; and Dr. B. W. Andrzejewski of the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies. Many others, including Somalis working or studying in the United States and Great Britain, have discussed vari¬ ous aspects of the book with me, to my great advantage, and I thank them all. Finally, I must add that the wit and good humor of my son Arthur Castagno contributed more to the completion of this book than he thinks. In the literature, Somali words are spelled in various ways, most often based on Italian, French, or English pho¬ netics. I have selected an English phonetic spelling, often having to choose from among several variations, and I have indicated plurals simply by adding an s. I had hoped to em¬ ploy the spelling used in the official Somali-English diction¬ ary, but was unable to obtain a copy of the dictionary. The map has been especially prepared for this book; it includes most of the places mentioned in the Dictionary. Much to my regret, it does not show the revised regional boundaries. I do not believe that the Somali government has yet published a map showing these boundaries. The best in¬ formation that I can provide on this point is included in the entry, Regional and Local Government.\n\nMargaret Castagno December 1,\n\n1974\n\nACRONYMS\n\nAFIS\n\nAmministrazione fiduciaria italiana della Somalia (Italian Trusteeship Administration)\n\nAID\n\n(United States) Agency for International Develop¬ ment\n\nBMA\n\nBritish Military Administration\n\nDC\n\nDistrict Commissioner\n\nEEC\n\nEuropean Economic Community\n\nGSL\n\nGreater Somalia League\n\nHDMS\n\nHizbia Dastur Mustaquil Somali (Somali Independent Constitutional Party)\n\nIBEAC\n\nImperial British East Africa Company\n\nNFD\n\nNorthern Frontier District\n\nNUF\n\nNational United Front\n\nOAU\n\nOrganization of African Unity\n\nPBU\n\nPatriotic Benefit Union\n\nSAIS\n\nSocieta Agricola Italo-Somala\n\nSDU\n\nSomali Democratic Union\n\nSIPA\n\nSomali Institute of Public Administration\n\nSNAI\n\nSocieta nazionale per l'agricoltura e l'industria (National Company for Agriculture and Industry)\n\nSNL\n\nSomali(land) National League\n\nSNP\n\nSomali National Police\n\nSONNA\n\nSomali National News Agency\n\nSRC\n\nSupreme Revolutionary Council\n\nSYL\n\nSomali Youth League\n\nUN\n\nUnited Nations x\n\nUNESCO\n\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n\nUSP\n\nUnited Somali Party\n\nxi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn July 1, I960, two newly independent states in the Horn of Africa united to form the Somali Republic. One was the former British protectorate of Somaliland. The other was former Italian Somaliland, which had been a UN trustee¬ ship territory since 1950. Immediately after unification, an already lively irredentist movement in three areas contiguous with the Republic took on new momentum. These were the Haud and Ogaden regions on the eastern periphery of Ethiopia (c. one million Somalis), the present North-Eastern Region of Kenya (c. 250,000 Somalis), and French Somaliland (c. 40,000 Somalis). The Somalis who live outside the Republic are closely related to those of the Republic, and it is inevitable that they be mentioned in many entries in the Dictionary. Not only are all Somalis related ethnically, but they speak the same language, practice the same religion, follow the same occu¬ pations, and have the same political and cultural heritage. These \"Somali characteristics\" differentiate the Somalis of Ethiopia, Kenya, and the French Territory from other inhabi¬ tants of those lands. For seven years after independence, the irredentist movement, supported by a strong pan-Somali policy on the part of the political parties and the governments of the Re¬ public, dominated the international scene in the Horn of Afri¬ ca. The movement in Ethiopia and the North-Eastern Region of Kenya led to sporadic armed skirmishes, a number of deaths, and much unrest. A British Commission of Inquiry in 1962-1963 documented the strength of the movement in North-Eastern Kenya. The political activities preceding the 1958 and 1967 referenda on the status of French Somaliland pointed up the separatist and pan-Somali feelings of the So¬ malis in that territory. The pan-Somali issue lost some of its intensity both domestically and internationally after 1967 when Prime Minisxiii\n\nXIV\n\nSomalia\n\nter Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal began to stress the need to give first priority to the Republic's internal economic and social development. But while attention had been focused on the pan-Somali issue, a large and unwieldy government bu¬ reaucracy grew up. New words were invented to describe corruption, nepotism, and injustice. Musug-masug covered all kinds of political hanky-panky, wheeling and dealing, in¬ trigue, and graft. Afminshar (literally, \"saw-mouth\") was used to describe individuals who spread rumors, who badmouthed, abused, or maligned others to attain their own ends. Today afminsharism against the government is a crime. On October 15, 1969, the President of the Republic, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, was assassinated by a member of his bodyguard. Apparently the assassination was an individual act, not part of a plot or conspiracy. Then, on October 21, when it became clear that the chief candidate for the presi¬ dency was a man who would merely continue the old \"politics as usual, \" the Army, under the leadership of General Mo¬ hamed Siad Barre, took over in a bloodless coup. Since the \"October Revolution, \" the government has been led by a Su¬ preme Revolutionary Council, with General Mohamed Siad Barre as President of the Somali Democratic Republic.\n\nThe Land and Its Influence The Republic covers about 246, 000 square miles. This makes it slightly smaller than the state of Texas and, with its three to four million inhabitants, less than hah as popu¬ lous as Texas. The Republic has a long coastline, about 2, 000 miles, fronting on the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. It has no great natural harbors, but the port facili¬ ties at Berbera in the north and Kismayu in the south were expanded and modernized in the late 1960s with Soviet and American aid. Much of the land is semidesert, with a vegetation of thornbush, acacia, and euphorbia. In many such areas, grass springs up during the rainy seasons and provides grazing for large herds of camels, cattle, sheep, and goats. In other areas, primarily in the flood plains and irrigated areas near the Juba and Shebelle Rivers in the Southern (former Italian) Region, millet, sesame, bananas, sugarcane, and other crops are grown. Rainfall is light and irregular, but when it is good, two crops can be planted and harvested in a year. Scant rainfall and the absence of rivers and lakes in a large\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nportion of the country make nomadic or seminomadic pastoralism the natural way of life for most Somalis. About 60 per cent of the population are pastoralists, an estimated 15 to 20 per cent engage in sedentary agriculture and the remainder are town dwellers. The nomads, with their herds of single-humped camels and their flocks of sheep and goats, are constantly on the move in search of pasturage and water for their animals. They travel in small groups (rers, or extended families), and in the course of a year cover hundreds of miles. Each year during the gu, or heavy rain season, thousands of So¬ malis from the Republic cross over into Ethiopia to reach their traditional grazing lands in the Haud and Ogaden. They then return to their home wells and lands in the Republic during the dair, or light rain season. The movements of the pastoralists and many of their social activities are guided by weather lore experts who study the stars, the sun and moon, the winds, and other natural phenomena to predict the most propitious time for setting out on trek and the best route to follow. Cattle herders, primarily in the central section of the Southern Region, are seminomadic; their base of operations is usually their home village, centered on a well, and their movements are more restricted than those of the camel herders. Although the Somali landscape is mostly flat, there are high mountainous areas in the Northern (former British) Region, with peaks reaching almost 8, 000 feet. This mari¬ time range, which includes the Ogo and Golis Mountains, lies behind a coastal plain, known as the Guban. The moun¬ tains are dissected by dry river beds which become fast¬ running streams for a short while after a heavy rain. The weather is hot throughout the year, except for brief cold spells in some of the very mountainous areas. Along the coast, the humidity is high. The temperature varies some¬ what according to the direction of the monsoons, which de¬ termine the seasons. Somalia is subject to both drought and flood. The most recent drought was in 1971. The terrible drought that struck many sub-Saharan African nations in the 1960s and 1970s had not by 1974 seriously affected Somalia. It is re¬ ported, however, that one severe dry year would place the nation in the \"hunger belt. \"\n\nXVI\n\nThe People:\n\nSomalia Division and Homogeneity\n\nThe typical Somali is rather tall and thin, with a rath¬ er long head and a brown complexion. But on any street in Mogadishu, the capital, a great variety of physical types may be seen. Often apparent in facial features are signs of inter¬ mixture with Arab or Negroid peoples. Although distinctions and allegiances based on clangroup affiliation and ethnic differences are now illegal in the Republic, such distinctions are important in Somali history. The chief division of the Somali people is between the Samaal and the Saab. The Samaal clan families—the Darod, Hawiye, Isaaq, and Dir--inhabit the areas north of the Shebelle River and south of the Juba. Largely pastoralists, they constitute the great majority of the population. The Saab clan families --the Digil and Rahanweyn— are mostly agriculturalists; they occupy the riverine and interriverine areas. The Saab have intermarried with Negroid, and perhaps Galla, peoples, who apparently occupied the fertile river areas before the Somalis came. The Samaal have traditionally regarded the Saab as less pure racially, and they regard the Saab dialect as a lower form of the Somali language. Also, the Saab engage in agriculture, an occupation which the pastoral Samaal have long regarded as menial. Intergroup warfare and feuding among clan families and subgroups--some organized as sultanates or federations-have also been prominent in Somali history. Disputes over pasturage and water rights were the chief causes of conflict and the disputes were usually won by the group with the great¬ est number of fighting men. Feuds were often long-lasting, however, and the arena of modern national politics provided a new setting in which old clan rivalries and distinctions could be carried on. Political parties sometimes broke up because some members felt they were being dominated by others who belonged to a different clan family. Government departments were sometimes said to be under the control of certain clan groups which discriminated against persons from other groups. In addition to the Somali, small groups of people known as sab live in the Republic. In the past, they engaged in blacksmith and leather work and other handicrafts. The sab along with small remnants of earlier Negroid populations and’ the descendants of former slaves, have traditionally been con¬ sidered distinct racial groups. Gradually these minorities are being accepted as full Somali citizens. Today most of\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nthem speak Somali and practice Islam, though a few continue to speak their own language or dialect. Despite these centrifugal aspects of Somali society, the homogeneity of the Somalis and the similarity of the tradition¬ al cultural and political institutions found in the various groups is remarkable. This homogeneity is attributed partly to the common ancestry of the Saab and Samaal and partly to the effects of Islam. The Shari'a, the body of Islamic law, was widely accepted in Somalia long before the European colonial powers arrived in the area. Religious leaders have long preached the need for unity and brotherhood and have prac¬ ticed this policy to a large extent in the formation of their religious settlements and farming communities. Today, more than 95 per cent of the inhabitants of the Somali peninsula are Muslim.\n\nLanguage and Literacy For a people with a literacy rate estimated at about five per cent in 1970, Somalis are notable linguists. All speak Somali, with some dialect differences, and all appre¬ ciate the highly complex form and vocabulary of classical Somali poetry. As Muslims, all know at least some Arabic. Further, for reasons of employment, education, or simple communication with colonial officials, many Somalis learned English, Italian, or French. In addition, many who live in the coastal trading towns and some of the small groups of non-Somali speak Swahili. This oral linguistic wealth reflects the history of the Republic, and partially explains the low literacy rate. Since Somali was unwritten (until 1972), and colonial educational institutions used English, Italian, or French, a Somali child normally had to learn three languages before he could begin to attain literacy: his native Somali; Arabic, the language of his religion; and a European language. Other explanations of the low rate of literacy come to mind, however. One is nomadism, which involves the constant movement of the majority of school-age children and their active employ¬ ment in the economy as herders. A second explanation is in¬ terclan antagonism and feuding. Although several scripts for the Somali language (based on Somali, Arabic, or Latin char¬ acters) were devised by Somalis over the years, none was acceptable nationwide. Some were alleged to assert the su-\n\nxviii\n\nSomalia\n\nperiority of the clan of the script's deviser over the other clans. Others were considered technically or linguistically inadequate. A third explanation lies in the religious conservatism of many Somali traditional leaders who opposed the use of any written language except Arabic, the language of the Holy Koran. Unfortunately, Arabic was a language foreign to all the colonial powers which might be assumed to have been responsible for developing an educational system during the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th. A final ex¬ planation is the minimal interest in educational development taken by the colonial powers. This neglect was reinforced by the Somalis' disdain of Christian teachers, whether they were associated with missionary activities or not. As the nationalistic fervor grew during the late 1940s and as independence became imminent in the 1950s,. Somali recognition of the problems of widespread illiteracy and the lack of a written Somali language grew. Although none of the elected governments from 1956 to 1969 felt strong enough po¬ litically to choose one of the existing scripts as the official one of the state and to impose its choice on the whole nation, the Supreme Revolutionary Council which came to power in the military coup of October 1969 has declared a Somali script based on Latin characters as the nation's only official language. This official script, introduced in 1972, has largely replaced the use of English, Italian, and Arabic in newspapers and government documents. The publication of textbooks in So¬ mali is in progress, and the preparation of a basic SomaliEnglish dictionary has been completed. These developments, along with the increasing num¬ bers of Somali teachers in the school system, may raise the literacy rate dramatically. In 1974, in a move to improve literacy, the government announced that all high schools would close for one year so that their students could go out into the interior and participate in an expanded educational program (and conduct a national census). A second reason for applauding the government's adop¬ tion of a Somali script is the impetus it will give to the pres¬ ervation of folk literature and the recording of traditional oral history.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nPoverty and Development Economically, Somalia is severely handicapped by a lack of mineral resources, by the semidesert nature of much of its land, and by the traditional acceptance of subsistence living by a majority of the people. Per capita income is estimated to be not more than $55 per annum. There has been active trading with the countries of Arabia and the Persian Gulf for many centuries, but this trade did not at any time lead to a general prosperity affect¬ ing the masses of the people. Nor did it lead to the develop¬ ment of any large-scale economic activities. A possible ex¬ ception is the increase in agricultural exports from the river areas during the second half of the 19th century. With the importation of slaves during that period, new land was opened to farming, and agriculture became highly profitable for some of the Somali clans, such as the Bimal and Geledi. But this development was interrupted by the advent of the Europeans, who halted the slave trade and eventually abolished slavery. Mineral resources, such as uranium, iron ore, baux¬ ite, and gypsum, are said to exist in Somalia, but they have not been fully explored and are not being exploited. Explora¬ tions for oil, though intensive, have yielded no positive find¬ ings. The nation's economy is supported by large inpourings of foreign assistance. The Supreme Revolutionary Council has estimated this aid at $460 million from 1960 to 1969. Much aid has come, and continues to come, from the United Nations. Before the 1969 coup, foreign aid in large amounts came chiefly from Western sources, the United States, Great Britain, and Italy, especially, although the Soviet Union under¬ wrote the development of the Somali National Army. Today most of the foreign aid comes from international agencies and Eastern-bloc countries. Italy, as the Administering Authority of the Trust Territory (the Southern Region) and as the form¬ er colonial power in that part of the Republic, contributed significantly in both money and manpower during the 19501960 decade, and continued its support to the independent na¬ tion. The economic development of the Republic is certain to be slow. It is seldom discussed in very optimistic terms, but many improvements have been recorded in the last two decades. The projected development budget for 1974-1978 is\n\nXX\n\nSomalia\n\nabout $550 million (So. Sh. 3,863, 357,000). It allocates 40 per cent to economic development (animal husbandry, agri¬ culture, and minerals); 11 per cent to health, education, housing, and public works; 19 per cent to industry and elec¬ tricity; 25 per cent to transportation and communications; five per cent to population and livestock censuses. Although Somalia is regarded as a poor nation, it is not overpopulated. The only areas of high unemployment are the larger government centers. In a country with few large cities, the city is a magnet for persons tired of the hard life of the nomadic interior and the agricultural village as well as for persons with ambition and nationalistic sentiments. It is primarily in the Somali city that the concrete results of the nationalist movement are visible. Not only does unemploy¬ ment grow as young people migrate to the cities, but also political awareness and discontent. The Supreme Revolution¬ ary Council has used self-help schemes and crash programs to reduce urban unemployment and to encourage the young people who crowded into the cities to return to the rural areas.\n\nHistorical Overview Somali colonial history dates back to the late 1880s, and includes the names of many men and clan groups who resisted the colonial powers overtly or simply by going their own way and being uncooperative. Some of these, such as the sultans of the Mijerteyn and of Obbia, succeeded in main¬ taining their own governments until the mid-1920s. In ef¬ fect their areas were under strict European control for only 25 years, a brief period in Somali history. One leader who developed a great following, Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan, led a 20-year jihad, or holy war, against the Europeans and Ethiopians--from 1899 to 1920. He was finally defeated, but not captured, by British air at¬ tacks. Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan is today recognized as an early nationalist. With his Dervishes, he interrupted British control of the Northern Region, influenced Italian policy in the Southern Region, resisted Ethiopian activities which supported the British, and waged open warfare against Somali clans who were neutral or friendly to the colonial powers. Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan was not only a political leader, but a learned poet and religious leader of the Salihiya Sufi order. His aims were to oust the foreign\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\n\"infidels\" and to purify Somali Islam and unite the Somalis. Only then, he thought, could Somalis live in peace and broth¬ erhood, without the interclan warfare that was endemic to the traditional political system. The two aims--political and religious--were interrelated, farsighted, and admired by later generations of Somali nationalists. Often, the Sayyid's move¬ ment seems to have been very costly, however, when one reads of the terror his activities brought to many Somali clans and of the number of Somali lives lost in the jihad, along with some European lives. Somali history is much more than the 70-year period of colonial intrusion and neglect and Somali resistance. Our knowledge of the precolonial period is not well documented; it is based largely on oral tradition and on scattered written sources that mention the Horn of Africa only in passing. Many of the documents were written by foreign traders and mariners or by geographers who either traveled with the mariners or picked up their information from them. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written about 60 A. D. by a Greek mariner, records that the southern ports of Somalia were controlled by Arabs and identifies Cape Guardafui as the Cape of Spices. The rise of Islam in the 7th century and the migration of Arab Muslims to the African continent are di¬ rectly related to the development of the Somali people as they are known today. A1 Yaqubi, an Arab geographer of the 9th century, mentions the ports of Zeila and Mogadishu, their culture and religious institutions, in The Book of the Cities. A Moroccan historian, Ibn Battuta, visited a number of Somali ports in the mid-1300s and describes them as flourishing centers of trade. Chinese contacts with the Somali coast are recorded in Tuan Cheng-shih's Yu-Yang-tsa-tsu, written during the 9th century, and in the journals of Cheng-Ho, who made three visits to the Somali coast in the early 1400s. Records of Portuguese activities in the area date back to the late 1400s. The Book of the Zengi, a medieval Arabic compila¬ tion, describes the Negroid (Zengi) inhabitants of the Somali river areas and the \"Berberi,\" presumably the Galla and Somali, of the more northern portions of Somalia. Inscrip¬ tions on tombstones and mosques in Mogadishu confirm some of the data found in this book. Shihab ad-Din, a Muslim\n\nXXI1\n\nSomalia\n\nchronicler of the 16th century, recorded the Adal-Ethiopian war led by the Adal imam Ahmad Guray. From oral sources, genealogical accounts, and linguis¬ tic analysis, some of the more distant history of the Somalis has been reconstructed. All these tell something about the confrontations between various groups as the Somali clan families developed and pursued their southwestward migrations. Legends of clan-family origins and of wise and crafty leaders, such as Arawelo and Wiil Waal, give further insight into the Somali past. But these sources tell us little about the effects of the confrontations between groups on the evolution of Somali in¬ stitutions and customs. We know, for example, that by the 19th century, the chief political forum among all the Somali groups was the shir, an open assembly of all the adult males of a clan or lineage formally associated by a heer contract. In the shir every man had an equal right to speak on the matters being discussed, and after long hours or days of dis¬ cussion and deliberation, the group would reach a unanimous decision on a course of action. The shir seems to have been a highly democratic institution. But conjectures about how and when the institution developed lead only to further tantalizing speculations. Some possible sources of early Somali history have been left unexplored for the most part. Little archaeological work has been carried out, and many tentative explorations have not been followed up. The cave paintings and inscrip¬ tions in the Northern Region, the thousands of pre-Islamic tombs, the ruined towns, the stone tools and objects found on the surface, the coins found in various places--all these cry out for further study. Nor has there been any sustained attempt to determine the origin and date of introduction of various domesticated food crops and animals. Oral history is transmitted in the stories told by old men and women, in the repetition of poems, and in genea¬ logical accounts. In the history of Somalia, the names of great poets seem to be more numerous than the names of great political leaders. Often political leaders were also poets and every clan had poets who composed works to com¬ memorate important battles and other events. The poems were commemorative, but they were also composed to in¬ struct the young in the clan's history and customs. No doubt many of these historical poems have been and will be lost\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxiii\n\nbecause the demands of modern nationalism require that old clan enmities and proud victories be submerged. The same is true of the genealogies. An individual's genealogy aligns him with certain groups and makes him the \"traditional enemy\" of other groups. Almost all Somalis use three names--their own, their fath¬ er's, and their grandfather's—and it is said that they can trace back their ancestry ten, twenty, or sometimes thirty generations. When two Somalis meet, they can often trace their genealogy to a common ancestor and to a particular clan or subclan of origin. Modern nationalism demands that these clan-group distinctions be forgotten, and so another source of historical data is drying up. Fortunately, a num¬ ber of early Somali writers published genealogical accounts of their clan groups. Because of the gaps in our knowledge of the Somali people and their past, much of what is described in the Dic¬ tionary as \"traditional\" refers only to the customs and prac¬ tices reported by Europeans who visited the area after the mid-1880s. We cannot assume that these practices were an¬ cient and unchanging, but only that they evolved from the-possibly quite different--customs and practices of preceding ages. The traditions reported by European writers, however, show a definite coherence in Somali development in the vari¬ ous regions and among the various groups. Colonialism, in¬ volving the imposition of different legal systems and reflect¬ ing the different approaches to colonial undertakings of the colonial powers, led to some disparities in the various Somali regions. But colonialism did not destroy the basic coherence that was there when the Europeans arrived. The European impact did not prevent the former British and Italian colonies from uniting successfully and integrating their pre-independence systems of government. More drastic changes than those brought about by the colonial powers are perhaps seen in the acts of post-independence governments, such as the termination of the arifa, or patron-client, system; the abolition of blood compensation and collective responsi¬ bility for certain crimes; and the elimination of chiefly titles and privileges. Above and beyond the impact of colonialism stand the traditional Somali culture and the influence of Islam, two ele¬ ments which bind all Somalis together and unite them as one people.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nDate\n\nEvent\n\n1st century\n\nEarliest known written record of the Somali area in PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHRAEAN SEA.\n\n8 th-10th centuries\n\nFirst legendary ARAB ancestors of Somali CLAN FAMILIES migrate to the Somali region and introduce ISLAM.

Sultan of the Bimal, who in the 1930s was made a Cavaliere Ufficiale by the Italian government. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Bimal were extremely anti-Italian. ABDILLAHI KARSHE. The most acclaimed modern Somali musician, a singer and composer of patriotic and popu¬ lar songs. He was a civil servant in the British pro¬ tectorate and a singer on Radio Hargeisa. In 1954, he formed a drama company which was soon broken up by the government because of its call for a violent re¬ sponse to the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1954. He is best known for his composition commemorating Pa¬ trice Lumumba, the Congolese leader who was killed in 1961. ABDILLAHI MUUSE. A poet, born in the late 19th century, known as a wise and peace-loving man; some of his sayings have become proverbs. It is said that he could recite the entire Koran from memory. ABDIRASHID ALI SHERMARKE (1919-1969). Second presi¬ dent of the Somali Republic. Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was born at Haradera, about 300 miles northeast of Mogadishu. He was a member of a chiefly family of Obbia. He attended Koranic school and in 1932 moved to Mogadishu, where he entered elementary school. He served briefly in the Italian colonial administration, and was employed as a government clerk by the British Military Administration 1\n\nAbdirazak\n\n2\n\nin the Southern Region. During the trusteeship period he attended the School of Politics and Administration and later the Higher Institute of Law and Economics. He then went to the University of Rome, where he grad¬ uated with honors, receiving a degree in political sci¬ ence in 1958. He became a member of the central committee of the Somali Youth League in 1950, and was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1959, his first political post. From 1960 to 1964 he was Prime Minister, and President from 1967 until his death. He was consid¬ ered a champion of militant Pan-Somali aspirations, but after he became President, he modified his policy to favor peaceful relations with neighboring countries. On October 15, 1969, he was assassinated by a mem¬ ber of his bodyguard. ABDIRAZAK HAJI HUSSEIN (b. 1924). Prime Minister from June 1964 to 1967. Abdirizak Haji Hussein was born near Galcaio in the Mudugh Region. During the British Military Ad¬ ministration of the Southern Region, he served in the army (1942 to 1947), and in 1950, during the Italian trusteeship period, was imprisoned for six months for political reasons. He joined the Somali Youth League in 1944 and served as its president in 1955-1956. In 1959 he was elected to the National Assembly. In the late 1950s, he was president of the Higher Institute of Law and Economics and later was president of the Uni¬ versity Institute. In the first government of the Re¬ public, he served first as Minister of Interior and later as Minister of Public Works and Communications. During his administration as Prime Minister, the Somali government was suspected of giving aid and sup¬ port to the irredentist movements in the Ethiopian Ogaden, North-Eastern Kenya, and French Somaliland. Al¬ though Abdirazak Haji Hussein strongly favored a Great¬ er Somalia, he persistently denied reports that the government was actively involved. His stated policy was to pursue the issue constitutionally, i. e., by peace¬ ful means. He called for UN plebiscites in the Somaliinhabited areas outside the Republic and asked the Or¬ ganization of African Unity to send fact-finding commis¬ sions to the areas to determine Somali desires. Neith¬ er organization acted, although the OAU passed a reso¬ lution favoring the retention of existing boundaries throughout Africa. See IRREDENTISM.\n\n3\n\nAbdulcadir\n\nAt the time of the 1969 coup, Abdirazak Haji Hussein was a member of Parliament. After the coup, he was detained and held, along with other detainees, in the presidential palace at Afgoy, until 1973. \" He is now (1974) the Somali Ambassador to the United Nations. ABDULCADIR SHEIKH SAKAWA (SHEIKH) (1871-1947). A religious leader and one of the founders and early presi¬ dents of the Somali Youth Club (later.-1. League). ABDULLAH SHAHARI. In 1905, he served as Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan's representative in making an agree¬ ment with the Italians in which the Sayyid was given the Nugal Valley territory. HV1908, he broke with the Say¬ yid and reputedly obtaipdd letters from the head of the Salihiya order in Medea denouncing the Sayyid and thus weakening'-t^ Sayyid's position. ABDULLAH SHEIKH MAHAMMAD (SHEIKH). A religious leader and first president of the Hizbia Digil-Mirifle Somali, a political party formed in the mid-1940s. ABDULLAHI ISSA MOHAMUD (b. 1922). A chief spokesman for the Somali Youth League before the Four-Power Commission and the United Nations in the late 1940s and early 1950s; Prime Minister in the Trust Territory from 1956 to 1960; and after independence a member of the cabinet. Following the October 1969 coup, he was held in detention until 1973. He is now (1974) the Somali ambassador to Sweden. Abdullahi Issa Mohamud was born in the Mudugh Region. In 1938 he worked as a clerk in the Italian administration, and in 1941 went into business. He joined the Somali Youth League in 1945, and served as its secretary-general from 1947 to 1954. ABDULRAHMAN KARIYEH (SHEIKH). A religious leader who became president of the National United Front when it was established as a political party in 1959. ABDURRAHMAN SHEIKH NUR (SHEIKH). A poet, and for¬ merly chief qadi of Borama in the Hargeisa Region. In 1933, he devised the Gadabursi (Borama) script in which he transcribed some of his own works. About 1920 he transcribed Somali into an Arabic script. Was for some years a teacher of religion in the Education Department of British Somaliland.\n\nAbgal\n\n4\n\nABGAL. A clan of the Hawiye clan family; the Abgal are largely nomadic pastoralists who live near Mogadishu. The Abgal (Darandolla) played a large role in over¬ throwing the Muzaffar dynasty which ruled Mogadishu from about 1500 to 1625. ABRUZZI, DUKE OF THE (d. 1933) (Luigi of Savoy). Ar¬ rived in Somalia in 1919, and in 1920 established the Societa Agricola Italo-Somala on the Shebelle River at Jowhar (Villagio duca degli Abruzzi, or Villabruzzi), where he obtained land by direct contract with the Shidle clan. ABYSSINIA\n\nsee\n\nETHIOPIA\n\nACACIA. The most common and most useful tree in the northern and central areas. Its roots are used in building the nomadic hut (agal); its bark is used to make mats and rope; its fruit is used for food; its trunk is used for firewood and charcoal; and its bark provides tannin for waterproofing woven fiber vessels. Certain species produce aromatic gums. ADAL. The Adal Sultanate, formerly called the Sultanate of If at, developed in the 9th or 10th century, with its cap¬ ital at Zeila, a center of Arab trade with the interior. The Muslim sultanate was engaged in a holy war with the Abyssinians in the 14th and 15th centuries, and the first recorded use of the word Somali dates from Ethi¬ opian songs celebrating the defeat of the Muslims. See HAQ AD-DIN; SA'D AD-DIN. In the 16th century, an Adal war against the Abyssinians was led by Ahmad Guray; at that time the capital of the sultanate was at Harar, in present-day Ethiopia. After some initial successes, the Muslims were again defeated and their expansion toward the west halted. See AHMAD GURAY. ADEN. Some 20, 000 Somalis live in Aden, from Somalia.\n\nacross the Gulf\n\nADEN ABDULLA OSMAN (b. 1908). President of the Legis¬ lative Assembly of the Trusteeship Territory from 1956 to 1960, and the first President of the Somali Republic (1960-1967). On July 1, 1960, he proclaimed the inde¬ pendence of the Somali Republic and the unification of the former Trust Territory and the former British\n\n5\n\nAdowa\n\nSomaliland protectorate. From October 1969, the date of the coup, until April 1973, he was detained, along with others, at the presidential palace at Afgoy. Aden Abdulla Osman was born at Beled Weyn. His father fought in the campaigns against Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. In 1922, when the first ele¬ mentary school was opened at Baidoa, he entered school. For the next five years he continued his schooling and worked as a domestic servant in Baidoa and Mogadishu. From 1928 to 1933, he was a medical assistant and chief of infirmary personnel at the De Martino Hospital in Mogadishu. Then he served in the government as a typist and interpreter. During the British Military Administration of the Southern Region, he engaged in trading, and in 1944 joined the Somali Youth League (which he served as president in 1954, 1955, and 1958). He was named a member of the Territorial Council in 1951 and selected Vice President of the Council (the highest post a Somali could hold). ADOWA. In 1896, Italian forces in Ethiopia were defeated at this Ethiopian town. The defeat is important in Somali history because it forced Italy, Britain, and France, the three European powers who had an interest in the Somali territory east of Ethiopia, to realize the need to establish boundary lines between their areas of influence and Ethiopia. The three powers signed boundary agreements with Emperor Menelik II in 1897. The agreements with Britain and Italy have been dis¬ puted by the Somalis, and a large section of the bound¬ ary between the Republic and Ethiopia is still under dis¬ pute. See BOUNDARIES; IR RE DENT ISM. AFAR. Also called Danakil. A non-Somali people living in the French Territory of the Afars and Issas, known until 1967 as French Somaliland, or the Cote Frangaise des Somalis. The Afar make up slightly more than half the population of the territory and the Somali Issa the remainder. A sizable number of Afars also reside in Ethiopia. AFGOY. a center of banana production, 20 miles west of Mogadishu, on the Webi Shebelle. The Central Agri¬ cultural Research Station and the education and liberal arts faculties of the National University are at Afgoy. In the 19th century, the town was an important market center in the domain of the Sultan of Geledi.\n\nAg AG.\n\n6 A naturally formed hole for collecting rain water. word is used primarily in the south.\n\nThe\n\nAGAL. The transportable beehive hut of the nomads. Flex¬ ible branches, forming the rounded skeleton of the hut, are tied together with cords made of root or skin. The skeleton is then covered with waterproof straw mats or formerly, among some groups, skins. See GURGI. AGE SETS. No age-set organization exists among the Somali, although vestiges of age-set practices are found among some groups of non-Somali origin. Circumcision and infibulation are individual rites, accompanied by no group ceremony. AGRICULTURE. About 12 per cent of the nation's land is regarded as cultivable; only about five per cent of this is actually under cultivation. Most of the cultivable land lies in the riverine areas of the Southern Region, where irrigation is made possible by the flooding of the Juba and Shebelle Rivers and where rainfall is about 20 inches per year. Some dryland farming is practiced by pastoralists in the western part of the Northern Re¬ gion around Tug Wajale. Subsistence agriculture, chiefly the production of grains, is carried on wherever rainfall permits. Market crops are, primarily, bananas, sugar¬ cane, cotton, and such grains as maize and millet. Sesame, rice, tobacco, kapok, peanuts, citrus fruits, beans, and other vegetables are grown on a small scale. Banana production employs about 25, 000 workers and accounts for about 40 per cent of the foreign exchange earnings. In all, 15 to 20 per cent of the total popula¬ tion of three to four million is engaged in sedentary agriculture. See CONCESSION AGRICULTURE. Compared with livestock herding, which em¬ ploys about 60 per cent of the population, farming is regarded by the pastoralist as a demeaning occupation. The farmers have a proverb to counteract this attitude. The proverb says: The man who owns no spot of land on earth cannot claim one in heaven. A form of agriculture which has been carried on in the northeast since time immemorial, and which has provided a unique export crop for many centuries, is the collection of frankincense, myrrh, and gum arabic.\n\n7\n\nAgriculture\n\nAGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT. The Agricultural Develop¬ ment Corporation (formerly Agency) was established in 1966. Its chief aims are to improve agricultural prac¬ tices and increase yields. Thus, it seeks to bring more land under cultivation, promote the formation of cooper¬ atives, aid farmers in procuring low-cost credit, and provide technical assistance in irrigation and in the pro¬ duction, storing, and marketing of crops. A further aim is to promote agricultural research and dissemi¬ nate experimental findings. The Corporation embraces the National Grain Marketing Organization and the Na¬ tional Organization for Agricultural Tractors, a machin¬ ery pool. See NATIONAL COMPANY FOR AGRICUL¬ TURE AND INDUSTRY. AGRICULTURE METHODS. Modern methods of irrigation and the use of farm machinery are largely limited to the sugar and banana plantations. Farming cooperatives may rent government-owned tractors. The traditional and most common instrument used by the individual farmer is the hoe, though some use ox-driven plows. Under traditional methods, the land is cleared by burning, and the ashes are left on the soil. The earth is then dug lightly and the seed planted. Raised platforms are constructed throughout the cultivated plot, and guards stand on the platforms to frighten away birds and other pests. When grain is harvested, the leaves and stalks are fed to livestock, the roots are left in the ground, and the grain itself is stored in underground silos or storage pits (diyehiin or gut), where it can be saved for long periods, even years. See IRRIGATION; LAND TENURE; SILO. AHMAD ABUBAKAR. A sultan of the Geledi, and a seer, who was made a Commander of the (Italian) Order of the Colonial Star. In the 1930s, he assisted the Ital¬ ians in organizing the cooperative farming groups which worked the plantations. It is said that the Italians con¬ sulted him in 1940 about the outcome of the war in the Horn of Africa. AHMAD GURAY (\"the left-handed\") (c. 1506-1543). Also re¬ ferred to as Ahmed Gran, Mohamed Gragne, and Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi. Some authorities give his dates as 1488-1544, and some claim that he was a Somali of the Darod clan family. There was, it is believed, a Somali with the same name.\n\nAhmad\n\n8\n\nAhmad Guray led the Muslims of the Adal Sul¬ tanate in a jihad, or holy war, against the Ethiopians and their Portuguese allies. His own army contained some Turkish and Egyptian contingents, as well as many Somalis. Using cannons, probably imported from Turkey, he succeeded in capturing sections of the Ethi¬ opian highlands, but was eventually defeated and killed near Lake Tana. His use of Turkish and Egyptian sup¬ port provided the basis for later Turkish and Egyptian claims to the area he ruled. Ahmad Guray's jihad against Ethiopia may have precipitated the migration of some Somali groups from the Gulf of Aden hinterland toward the south. Ahmad Guray is important in Somali history because, whatever his ethnic origin, he provided the Somalis with their first national hero. AHMAD SHIRWA BIN MUHAMMAD (SHEIKH). A follower of Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. In 1917, Sheikh Ah¬ mad was arrested by the Italians and found to be carry¬ ing letters from the Sayyid to the Ottoman Turks in which the Sayyid asked that he and his followers be placed under Turkish protection. AHMADIYA. One of the major Sufi orders, or tariqas, in Somalia. See DANDARAWIYA; QADIRIYA; RIFAIYA; SALIH IYA. The Ahmadiya was introduced into Somalia by Sheikh Ali Mayi Durogba in the mid-19th century. Its agricultural settlements (jamaha) are found in many re¬ gions of Somalia, but are most numerous in the areas near or between the Juba and Shebelle Rivers. Its members devote themselves mainly to teaching. The order is regarded as somewhat puritanical in that it opposes the use of tobacco and khat, a narcotic. The Salihiya and the Dandarawiya orders branched off from the Ahmadiya. AJURAN. The Ajuran inhabited the Shebelle valley from the late 14th to the early 17th century and controlled the watering places, the agricultural centers, and the trade routes to the coastal cities of Merca and Mogadishu. It is not known whether they were members of the Hawiye clan family, a confederation of various clan groups, or an aristocracy growing out of Somali-Arab intermar¬ riage. The rise of the Ajuran coincided with the mi¬ gration of the Hawiye to the Shebelle area and the\n\n9\n\nAkil\n\narrival of new groups of Arabs to the coastal areas. The Ajuran maintained their control by military might, but, if not from the beginning, at least from some un¬ known time, they also governed according to Islamic law. The Ajuran were headed by an imam, a chief who lived in the interior, and who was allied to or, perhaps, related to the Muzaffar dynasty that ruled Mo¬ gadishu from about 1500. The Muzaffar dynasty was overthrown by new Somali (Abgal, Darandolla) incur¬ sions in the 17th century, and the last imam of the Ajuran was killed in battle while fighting the Somali migrants who were then moving into the Shebelle valley and the coastal area. The Ajuran at this point mi¬ grated southward. Traditional history holds that the stone wells in the Benadir interior and some of the irrigation sys¬ tems in the Shebelle valley were constructed by the Aju¬ ran. AKIL.\n\nAn Arabic word meaning \"headman. \" From 1874 to 1884, Egypt occupied Harar and claimed jurisdiction over the Somali coast from Zeila on the Gulf of Aden to Ras Hafun on the Indian Ocean. To maintain liaison with the Somalis, the Egyptians appointed Somali repre¬ sentatives with the title of akil. When the British as¬ sumed jurisdiction in 1884, \"\"they continued the policy of appointing and paying akils, persons approved by the Somali groups they represented. In the area under Italian control, the same policy was followed, but the stipended representatives had the title of chief or no¬ table. The akil or chief was supposed to explain co¬ lonial administrative policy to his people and assist in maintaining order. The akil institution was not indige¬ nous to the Somali system and was never a very satis¬ factory solution to the need it was intended to serve.\n\nAKIL COURTS. In the Northern Region, during the British administration, akils, in some circumstances, held minor courts to handle noncriminal cases. These courts were replaced by Subordinate Courts in 1945. ALI YUSUF (d. 1960). Sultan of Obbia from 1911 to 1925, when he was deposed by Italian colonial forces. Dur¬ ing the years of activity of Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan (1899-1920), the sultans of Obbia were on the\n\nAmarani\n\n10\n\nwhole hostile to the Sayyid, but in 1903, Ali Yusuf and his father, the Sultan Yusuf Ali \"Kenadid, \" were briefly arrested and exiled after being accused of cooperating with the Sayyid.\n\nJ\n\nAMARANI. A group who live primarily at Brava, but also at Merca, Mogadishu, and Afgoy. Most are merchants or sailors, speaking a Swahili dialect (Chimbalazi). According to their traditions, the Amarani were the first inhabitants of the Brava area. Their ancestors are believed to have come to the Benadir coast from south Arabia, possibly being Israelites who left Arabia during the early expansion of Islam and who intermar¬ ried with the local inhabitants.

ANGLO-ETHIOPIAN DIPLOMACY. After the 1896 defeat of the Italians at Adowa by the army of the Ethiopian Em¬ peror Menelik II, the British sought to delineate the boundary between the British protectorate of Somaliland and the territory under Ethiopian control. The first treaty was signed in 1897, and out of it a series of other treaties or agreements arose. ANGLO-ETHIOPIAN TREATY OF 1897. During the 1880s, Ethiopia announced her claim to all of the Horn of Afri¬ ca and expanded a limited control to some territory populated by Somalis. During this period, Great Bri¬ tain had signed treaties with Somali groups, guarantee¬ ing them protection against Ethiopian claims. Under the 1897 treaty, Ethiopia gave up her claim to about half the protectorate area, and Britain ceded to Ethiopia the region of the Haud, a traditional Somali grazing area. Under the treaty, Ethiopia guaranteed orderly government in the Haud and Somali access to it. The Somalis themselves were unaware that any treaty had been signed until 1954; the treaty was not published or the boundary marked until the early 1930s. This treaty is the basis of the present boundary dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia in the Northern Region. ANGLO-ETHIOPIAN BOUNDARY COMMISSION. The Ethiopian-British Somaliland boundary agreed upon in the\n\n11\n\nAnglo-Ethiopian\n\n1897 treaty was marked on the ground by an AngloEthiopian commission between 1932 and 1934. Con¬ crete posts were installed to mark the boundary line. Somalis protested the installation of the markers and knocked some of them down. The protest gave rise to several incidents, in which one British district commis¬ sioner lost his life. Late in 1934, the commission went to Wal Wal, where Somalis had access to wells and grazing areas. There the commission encountered an Italian armed force which had taken possession of the wells. The Wal Wal encounter led to the Italian in¬ vasion of Ethiopia and the Italo-Ethiopian war of 19351936. The Italians conquered Ethiopia and remained in control until defeated by the British in 1941. See WAL WAL. ANGLO-ETHIOPIAN AGREEMENTS OF 1942 AND 1944. In 1941, the whole of the Somali-inhabited area formerly held by the Italians and Ethiopians, as well as British Somaliland, which the Italians captured for a short while, came under the British Military Administration (BMA). Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, who had been in exile in Europe during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia (1935-1941), returned to Ethiopia and in 1942 and 1944 signed two agreements with Great Britain re¬ garding the Somali-inhabited Haud and \"reserved” area ceded to Ethiopia in the 1897 treaty. The \"reserved\" area was a strip of territory adjoining French Somali¬ land, through which the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railroad passes. The 1942 and 1944 agreements placed the territory under BMA control. The Ogaden territory, which lies to the south of the Haud and is contiguous with the fomer Italian colony, was also placed under the BMA, where it remained until 1948. The 1942 and 1944 agreements had specific time limitations, and were primarily for the purpose of assuring Somalis of their traditional grazing and watering rights in the wartorn area until Ethiopia could reestablish her govern¬ ment and guarantee these rights herself. ANGLO-ETHIOPIAN PROTOCOL OF 1948. This agreement marked the return of the Ogaden area to Ethiopia and the withdrawal of the British Military Administration. The protocol also fixed the provisional boundary line between Ethiopia and the ex-Italian colony. This line became effective in 1950, and is the subject of the dis¬ puted boundary between Ethiopia and the Southern Region of Somalia.\n\nAnglo-Ethiopian\n\n12\n\nANGLO-ETHIOPIAN AGREEMENT OF 1954. The 1954 agree¬ ment merely implemented the treaty of 1897. But the announcement of the agreement apprised the Somalis for the first time of the 1897 treaty and set off a strong and bitter outcry among the Somalis of the protectorate. In response to the Somali reaction, the British offered to buy the Haud from Ethiopia, but were turned down. At this point, the Somalis organized the National United Front and attempted to present the case to the Inter¬ national Court at The Hague. See NATIONAL UNITED FRONT. ANGLO-FRENCH TREATY OF 1888. The boundary between the Somali Republic and the French Territory of the Afars and Issas, fixed by this treaty, is the only boundary of Somalia whose legality the Somalis recog¬ nize. ANGLO-ITALIAN ACCORDS. With the signing in 1889 of the Treaty of Ucciali between Italy and Ethiopia, Italy and other European powers believed that the Ethiopian Em¬ peror Menelik II had placed his country under Italian protection and that Italy was responsible for Ethiopia's external relations. On this assumption, Britain and Italy sought to agree on their respective spheres of in¬ fluence in the Horn. ANGLO-ITALIAN PROTOCOLS OF 1891 AND 1894. These agreements were an attempt to define the boundaries between Italian and British areas in the Jubaland, north of Kenya, and in the Somali-Ethiopian interior. The 1891 agreement recognized that the Somali port of Kismayu and the territory on the west bank of the Juba River belonged to Britain, while the territory on the east bank belonged to Italy. The 1894 agreement recognized the Ogaden area as falling within the Italian sphere of influence and the Haud as within the British. Ethiopia was not informed of the 1894 agreement; if she had been, she would have rejected it, because she did not accept the interpretation of the Ucciali treaty which appeared to give Italy the right to go forward with the 1894 agree¬ ment. After the Italian defeat at Adowa in 1896, the British dealt directly with Ethiopia in the Anglo-Ethiopi¬ an treaty of 1897.\n\n13\n\nAnglo-Italian\n\nANGLO-ITALIAN AGREEMENT OF 1925. This agreement arose from the 1891 Anglo-Italian protocol regarding the Jubaland, and other agreements between Britain and Italy concerning the \"spoils” of World War I. Af¬ ter the war, Britain assumed control of certain former German colonies, unrelated to Somali history, and ceded to Italy Kismayu and the Jubaland. The 1925 agree¬ ment confirmed these transfers and fixed the boundary between the British colony of Kenya and Italian Somali¬ land. The boundary line was drawn through Somaliinhabited territory, leaving some Somalis in Kenya and adding some to the Italian colony. ANGLO-ITALIAN-FRENCH TREATY OF 1906. Under this agreement, Great Britain, Italy, and France agreed to cooperate to maintain the political and territorial status quo of Ethiopia. The Italians, however, felt that the treaty expanded their sphere of influence and gave them the right to respond militarily if Ethiopia threatened their position in Somalia. See WAL WAL. ANIMALS. Somalia is primarily a land of nomadic or seminomadic pastoralists. In 1971, the livestock population, according to one estimate, was almost 15 million: camels (three million), sheep (3.95 million), goats (five million), cattle (2. 85 million), and small numbers of oxen and horses. By contrast, a 1967 estimate placed the total number of domesticated animals at about ten million. See HERDING; LIVESTOCK DE¬ VELOPMENT. Somalia's wild animals are typically African— elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, buffalo, cheetah, antelope--though some are unique to the area. Clark's gazelle, Speke's gazelle, and the Somali wild ass are believed to be unique to Somalia. The reticulated gi¬ raffe, found only in East Africa, is seen in the lower Juba area. The Somali leopard is the source of the world's most expensive fur. Game reserves have not been widely developed in Somalia, and the wildlife has not been effectively protected. Many animals formerly plentiful are now vanishing. Some fell victim to poachers and to organi¬ zations which in the 1960s tracked them down by air¬ craft and truck and shipped them out alive. The everincreasing herds of camels, cattle, and goats and the destruction of forests by herds and by charcoal pro¬ ducers have further limited the wildlife population.\n\nArabic\n\n14\n\nARABIC. Most, if not all, Somalis know some Arabic; it was one of the official national languages until 1972 when Somali was established as the sole national lan¬ guage. During the 1950s and 1960s, some newspapers and newspaper columns were printed in Arabic. Be¬ ginning in 1974, New Era, a government-sponsored monthly review, was printed in an Arabic edition (as well as in English and Italian editions). Arabic is the language of instruction in the Koranic schools, which many Somali children attend from about four to six years of age. See LANGUAGE; LITERACY. ARABS. It is believed that Arabs inhabited the Somali coast¬ al centers in the first century A. D. In the 7th century and thereafter, at the time of the Muslim wars in Ara¬ bia, Arabs came to Somalia as traders, immigrants, and propagators of Islam. Beginning about 1300, and continuing during the Muslim wars with Ethiopia, Ara¬ bian sherifs and sayyids came to the Horn in the hope of augmenting their wealth and religious following. Al¬ though there were probably no tribal migrations of Arabs to the area, individuals and small groups estab¬ lished themselves on the coast and were, in general, in charge of the coastal trade. They lived in close touch with the native inhabitants, adopted their language, intermarried, and in the process carried out the Islamization of the region. A1 Yaqubi, an Arab geogra¬ pher of the 9th century, wrote of the trade, culture, and religious institutions centered in Zeila and Mogad¬ ishu. The eponymous ancestors of the Somalis derive from members of the Koreish (or Quraysh) tribe of Arabia, from which the Prophet Mohamed sprang. Little is known about early Arab immigrants, but their influence on the religion and social organization of the Somalis is clear. See CLAN FAMILIES. ARAWELO. A legendary queen, remembered in folk tales for her cruelty as well as her wisdom. Her intense hatred of men led her to set impossible tasks for them, and then have them killed when they were unable to carry out her wishes. ARCHAEOLOGY. Virtually no systematic excavations of ruined buildings have been undertaken in Somalia, al¬ though the number of ruins in evidence would seem to warrant investigation. See PREHISTORIC RUINS.\n\n15\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn August 1932, Gualtiero Benardelli spent five days excavating the remains of a small walled town on the coast near Meregh, about 200 miles north of Mo¬ gadishu. He suggested that the town may have been an administrative center in Ajuran times, in the 16th century. The British Institute of Archaeology and History in East Africa conducted a two-week preliminary sur¬ vey of ruins along the coast from Kismayu to Merca in 1960, but the survey was not followed up despite some promising finds. In 1971, a team of Soviet archaeolo¬ gists looked for sites in the central and northern areas, but in 1974, had not published the results of their in¬ quiry. ARCHITECTURE. Arabian-style houses, with two or more stories and with crenellated roofs, are typical of the larger coastal towns. The houses are built of stucco and stone and are whitewashed, or sometimes pastelcolored. Many buildings constructed during the coloni¬ al administrations and since independence follow this pattern. Persian influences have also been noted in some of the minarets of the coast. Among the nomads, dwellings are the transportable beehive hut, while among the settled agriculturalists and in the coastal villages and quarters of the larger towns, the houses are of wattle and daub. See AGAL; ARISH; MUNDUL. ARIFA. Strangers adopted as clients of a host clan. The practice of adoption was especially important in the up¬ per and lower Juba areas during the period of Somali migrations. After the status of arifa was abolished in 1960, the arifa often had difficulty retaining the land they had been allocated by their patrons, and they of¬ ten lost the protective dia-paying, cooperative-farming, livestock-marketing, and watering arrangements they had with their patrons. Sometimes spelled harifa. See ABBAAN; SHEEGAT. ARISH. Ordinary dwelling houses of several rooms found in the coastal towns. The arish is rectangular, with a broken, sloping roof thatched with palm leaves or grass, and with walls of slender posts covered with a daub of soil, ashes, and dung. Sometimes the arish is painted white or rose. The construction is similar to that of the mundul (q.v. ).\n\nArms\n\n16\n\nARMS. Before the use of firearms during the jihad (18991920) of Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan, Somali weapons of war consisted chiefly of knives, bows, swords, and spears. Knives intended for war and hunting and for daily use are double-edged, with handles of hippo ivory. They are carried in leather cases at¬ tached to the belt. The spear, used also for protec¬ tion against wild animals, has a staff of knotted wood and an iron tip. Swords have long, narrow blades and handles of horn, and are carried in leather cases. Bows, little used today, are made of wood, with a cord of camel tendon or gut. Arrows, with iron tips, are carried in quivers of wood and leather. Shields are round, about 12 inches in diameter, with a raised point in the center, and are made of rhino, giraffe, or oryx skin. They have a leather handle on the inside, and are ornamented with incised concentric circles and parallel lines. The use of poisoned arrows is recorded during the Muslim-Ethiopian wars of the 16th century; a group known as the El-Maya, armed with bows and poisoned arrows, fought on the side of the Ethiopians against the armies of Ahmad Guray. Poisoned arrows have been prohibited since the 1930s. Poison was made from certain roots, boiled and pounded, and kept in cattle horns. See FIREARMS. AROMATIC GUMS. The trees supplying aromatic gums are concentrated in the northeast: frankincense (maidi) comes from three species of Boswellia; myrrh (beio) from the Commiphora; and gum arabic from the acacia. Aromatic gums have been an important export of the area for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. Somalia supplies about 60 per cent of the world's frank¬ incense, much of it going to Islamic countries where it is used in religious ceremonies. The trees are usually regarded as the property of the clan within whose area they grow. In the past, the incense gatherers sold their produce to middlemen in the coastal cities; today they are largely joined to¬ gether in cooperatives made up of producers, gatherers, and merchants. The gatherers make an incision in the tree and return in a few days to collect the \"tears\" and make a new incision. The gum is not processed in Somalia, but sold in much the same form in which it is colie cted. Somalis use the gums in religious and other\n\nART.\n\n17\n\nArt\n\nceremonies. Women use them for smoke baths. is used in treating wounds.\n\nMyrrh\n\nAlthough paintings and wood carvings of animal and human forms are sometimes seen today, the Somalis, as Muslims, have traditionally rejected the reproduc¬ tion of such forms. Domestic objects of wood, such as combs, vases, bowls and plates, spoons, water bottles, headrests, small boxes, and mortars, are decorated with geometric designs. Such patterns as the undulated plait, triangles filled with crosshatchings, the circle and dot, concentric circles, and chevrons are common, as is the rosette. Incense burners and charcoal burners of meerschaum are similarly deco¬ rated. Fine gold and silver jewelry is made in a variety of intricate designs. Ivory and hippo teeth are used for knife handles, and leather is used for carry¬ ing cases and shields. Mats and receptacles are woven of natural or brightly colored straw; the latter are sometimes decorated with cowry shells. See also AZANIA; MUSIC; POETRY.\n\nASKARI.\n\nPoliceman.\n\nASTROLOGY. There is a rich oral literature concerning the use of astrology and astronomy in connection with agri¬ culture, livestock herding, and personal and religious events. See DABSHID; WEATHER LORE. AU.\n\n1) Title for a wadad, saint, or religious devotee, used before the individual’s name. 2) In the southern agricultural areas, an au, or magistrate of water, sometimes referred to as au uared, may be chosen to regulate the use of uars, ~r man-made ponds.\n\nAU BARKHADLE\n\nsee\n\nSHEIKH YUSUF KAWNEYN\n\nAU HILTIR. A legendary pre-Islamic figure of Rahanweyn origin, an important saint among the Shidle clan. Ac¬ cording to legend, Au Hiltir gave the Shebelle River to the Shidle because they received his body, which flew to them after it was desecrated by the Geledi who then lived on the river banks. Au Hiltir is said to protect people from the crocodile. It is believed by some au¬ thorities that at some time in ancient history, the She¬ belle River did change its course.\n\nAu Mad\n\n18\n\nAU MAD. Also spelled Au Mahhad. A pre-Islamic saint of Rahanweyn origin who, after his death, flew from Bur Acaba to Badi-Addo on the Shebelle River. Au Mad is the guardian of the harvest, protecting the crops from predatory birds. AWES CADRLA (SHEIKH). First president of the Somali Youth League. Son of Sheikh Awes Muhammad Barawi (q.v.). AXUM. An ancient kingdom in the highlands of modern Ethi¬ opia, one of the outposts of the Roman Empire. Axum accepted Christianity in the 4th century. Zeila, a Somali coastal town on the Gulf of Aden, was one of Axum's major outlets to the sea. Axum was at its height in the 5th century, had begun to disintegrate in the 7th, and by the 8th, its coastal areas were con¬ trolled by Muslims. Modern Ethiopian claims to the Somali-inhabited areas are based on events dating back to the Axumite era. AZANIA. The term refers to the coastal strip of East Afri¬ ca from Cape Guardafui, in Somalia, to Sofala, in Mozambique. It is used in early books, such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 60 AD) and Ptolemy's Geography (c. 400 AD). The predominantly Arab and Persian culture of Azania gave rise to a distinctive art, called Azanian art. In Somalia, the chief examples of this art are seen in the Mosque of Sheikh Abdul Aziz and the Mosque Fakhr ad-Din, both in Mogadishu. AZIENDA AGRARIA GOVERNATIVA. In 1912, this organiza¬ tion was granted concessions at Jenale on the lower Shebelle River for the production of bananas. The plantations did not accomplish very much until the 1930s, when the Italian government moved to improve working conditions, establish villages for the workers, and give the concessionaires incentives for increased production. The plantations were unproductive, during the war years, 1935 to 1942 and thereafter, but were put back into operation under a new system during the 1950s. These plantations, now owned by Italians and Somalis, provide Somalia's chief agricultural export. See also BANANA MONOPOLY; ROYAL BANANA MO¬ NOPOLY.\n\n19\n\nBaali\n\n- B BAALI. Natural basins where rain collects. Traditionally, baali belong to the group inhabiting the territory where they are located, and all members of the group can water their livestock at the baali freely. Visiting groups must obtain the consent of the owning group be¬ fore taking their livestock to the baali. BAIDOA\n\nsee\n\nISHA BAEDOA\n\nBAJUNI. A non-Somali ethnic group of about 1, 000 living primarily in the Bajuni Islands, off the coast of the Lower Juba Region, south of Kismayu. The Bajuni are largely engaged in fishing and sailing. Chinese records of the Ming period (13 6 8-1644) indicate that the Bajuni traded in tortoise shell, shark fins, and sea cucumbers. The Bajuni speak a Swahili dialect. It is believed that they descended from an intermixture of Arab or Per¬ sian settlers and the local population, although some authorities note that they may also have a Melanesian affinity. BALOLEY. A song of short verses, each often independent of the others in content. Sometimes it is didactic, to instruct the listeners in the language, in comportment, in controversial questions. It is a song of the nomadic interior, and is always sung in a recreational setting and an entertaining manner. BALWO. An Arabic word meaning evil or misfortune. In Somalia, the modern love songs, now called heello, were originally called balwo. The balwo has been described as a \"miniature\" because it often consists of only one or two lines. The form was invented in 1944 and became very popular. It is not much used today. BANANA EXPORTS. Until 1962, bananas were Somalia's chief source of foreign exchange earnings. Since 1962, banana exports have continued to rise, but have been exceeded in most years by exports of livestock and animal products. Most of the bananas are purchased by Italy. After the Suez Canal was closed in 1967, banana ships had to travel around the Cape of Good Hope. The opening of the enlarged deep seaport at Kismayu, the introduction of the Poyo variety of banana on the plantations, and the employment of better fungi-\n\nBanana Monopoly\n\n20\n\ncides and faster and better-equipped ships--all in the late 1960s—to a large extent overcame the disadvan¬ tages of the around-the-Cape journey. BANANA MONOPOLY. During the colonial period, the Somali banana industry was an Italian state monopoly (the Royal Banana Monopoly). In 1950, at the begin¬ ning of the trusteeship period, the Italian Banana Mo¬ nopoly was established, and Somali banana exports be¬ gan to rise. Under the monopoly, all bananas for ex¬ port were sold to Italy at high, government-supported prices, thus assuring the producers (largely Italian plantation owners) a profitable market. While the in¬ dustry prospered, it probably could not have become competitive on a free market. The monopoly was dis¬ solved in 1965, but the Italian government continued to subsidize banana production until 1969 by purchasing Somali bananas at a price above the international mar¬ ket price. See NATIONAL BANANA BOARD. BANANAS. The Juba banana, a local strain of the Cavendish or Musa sinesis, was the chief variety of banana grown in Somalia until the late 1960s. Today, the Poyo va¬ riety has largely replaced the Juba. The Poyo can withstand the long period of shipment better and has, in the long run, resulted in higher yields. It is more suited to local conditions and is less easily bruised than the Juba. BANKING. During the colonial period, banking facilities were largely limited to branch banks of British and Italian firms. In the 1950s, a Government Savings Bank was established in British Somaliland, and the Somali National Bank and the Somali Credit Bank (Credito Somalo) were created in the Trust Territory. Branches of four British and Italian banking houses that operated in the two territories before independence and during the 1960s were nationalized in 1970. The Somali National Bank is the Republic's central bank; the Somali Savings and Credit Bank ex¬ tends medium- and long-term credit, and the Somali Commercial Bank provides short-term loans. BANTU\n\nsee\n\nHABASHO; NEGROID PEOPLES\n\nBARDERA (Tall palm). A town on the Juba River, about 150 miles inland, founded in 1819 as the site of one of\n\n21\n\nBenadir Coast\n\nthe first jam aha in southern Somalia. The settlement may have been affiliated with the Qadiriya Sufi order, although some authorities feel that its puritanical regu¬ lations point to links with the Ahmadiya. The founder of the settlement, Sheikh Ibrahim Hassan Jebro, died shortly after his arrival in Bardera. He was succeeded by Ali Dure. The community outlawed the use of to¬ bacco, abolished frivolous dancing, compelled its women to wear the veil, and condemned the ivory trade. In 1836, the settlement entered a militant phase, first under Sheikh Abiker Aden Durow, then under Sherifs Abdurahman and Ibrahim. The reformers de¬ clared a jihad (holy war) against the \"lax\" Muslims of the region, and in 1840 sacked the coastal town of Brava. In 1843, Bardera was besieged and destroyed by an alliance of the Tunni of Brava and the Geledi, whose trade in ivory and other products was interrupted by the militant Bardera religionists. In the 1843 war— a vivid event in Somali oral tradition—Bardera found allies among the Bimal, old enemies of the Geledi. Bardera was not reoccupied until the 1860s. Throughout the late 19th century, Bardera was governed by a series of fundamentalist Muslim sheikhs who engaged in sporadic warfare with the Galla inhabi¬ tants of the right bank of the Juba. Bardera's leaders also apparently condoned the attack on the ill-fated von der Decken expedition which ascended the Juba River as far as Bardera in 1865. The remains of the German explorer's boat can still be seen in the rapids above Bardera. Though never openly hostile to the Italian colonizers who arrived in the 1890s, elements of the Bardera community may have collaborated with the der¬ vishes of Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. The town is today an important religious settlement. BENADIR COAST. The southern coastal area from Itala (Adale) to Kismayu. The area came under the nominal control of the Sultan of Oman in the late 17th century. When the seat of the sultanate was permanently shifted to Zanzibar in 1840, the Benadir Coast fell under the close scrutiny of the Sultan of Zanzibar, from whom Britain and Italy acquired it in 1888-1889. BENADIR COMPANY (1898-1905). This company, the Societa Anonima Commerciale Italiana del Benadir, replaced the Filonardi Company in administering the Italian-controlled ports of the Benadir Coast, after a two-year period of\n\nBenadir Cotton\n\n22\n\ndirect government control. It, like the Filonardi Com¬ pany, did little to upset the traditional Somali political and social system. The Benadir Company was largely organized by Antonio Cecchi, an avid colonialist who initially hoped to build up agricultural concessions in the Benadir and carry on trade with the Somalis of the interior. After Cecchi was killed in 1896, the company was headed by Ernesto Dulio. It was unable to estab¬ lish any agricultural enterprises and its staff was torn by internal disputes. The threat of Somali uprisings and Ethiopian incursions and a scandal stemming from the continuation of the slave trade and domestic slavery also contributed to the company’s failure. In 1905, the Italian government assumed direct responsibility for the Somali areas. BENADIR COTTON. A cotton cloth produced at Mogadishu, Brava, and Merca. The cloth, plain or striped, in red, yellow, blue, and other colors, with a white back¬ ground, is handwoven by men. It is used locally and has been an article of export since the 14th century, if not before. BERBERA. (pop. c. 45, 000) An ancient Gulf of Aden port in the Hargeisa Region. Berbera was mentioned by Arab geographers in the 13th century. It was sacked by the Portuguese in 1518. By the early 1800s, and perhaps much earlier, Berbera was controlled by So¬ mali clans of the interior, and was a major center of trade. In 1855, after a British officer in Richard F. Burton's expedition was killed at Berbera, the British secured a trade treaty with the Somalis and established a British Resident at Berbera. This treaty was the basis for British claims to the Somali coastal areas on the Gulf of Aden. Berbera served as the center of British colonial operations from 1885 until the conclu¬ sion of World War II, when the government center was moved to Hargeisa. The port of Berbera has facilities for ocean¬ going vessels, and is the chief export point for live¬ stock. It has two 4, 000-foot piers, constructed with USSR aid, plus a radio station with a 5, 000-mile range. BERKAD. A concrete water reservoir. Often a village will develop around a berkad, and nomads who come there\n\n23\n\nBevin Plan\n\nto water their stock remain for extended periods, the result that the area becomes overgrazed.\n\nwith\n\nBEVIN PLAN. A proposal presented in 1946 by British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin to the Allied Powers' Council of Foreign Ministers during its deliberations on the disposition of the former Italian colonies. The Bevin Plan would have placed the Somali-inhabited areas of British and Italian Somaliland (then under British Military Administration) under a British trusteeship. Bevin used the phrase \"greater Somaliland” to describe the proposed trust territory, a phrase which later be¬ came a rallying cry for Somali nationalists. The Bevin Plan, which was rejected, was strongly opposed by the Russian delegation to the Council of Foreign Ministers; it was favored by some Somalis. BIMAL. The Bimal are the largest Dir clan-family group. They have occupied the town of Merca and its hinter¬ land since perhaps 1690 when their traditions claim they overthrew the representatives of the Sultan of Ajuran. Predominantly pastoralists, the Bimal from time to time controlled the caravan trade routes to Merca. They also engaged (and continue to engage) in agriculture in the lower Shebelle area. When the im¬ portation of slaves for farming became widespread in the mid-1800s, the Bimal grew rich and powerful, ex¬ changing agricultural products as well as livestock and goods from the interior (ivory, hides, skins, horses, slaves) for imported goods at Merca. The Bimal engaged periodically in wars with the Geledi, their traditional rivals, who controlled the trade routes to Mogadishu and Brava and a great share of the wealth of the Shebelle farming country; the two clans were opponents in the Bardera wars. In this rivalry, the Bimal sought assistance from the Sultan of Zanzibar, who established a garrison at Merca in the 1860s—the only Zanzibari garrison on the coast at the time. In the recurrent Bimal-Geledi wars, the politically cohesive Bimal were largely successful, kill¬ ing at least two powerful Geledi sultans. Italian efforts to abolish slavery and engage in trade were strongly resisted by the Bimal, as well as by sections of the Geledi, both of whom depended on slaves to cultivate their farms and both of whom were engaged in the caravan trade. The Bimals’ resistance to the Italians began in 1896. They besieged an Italian\n\nBio\n\n24 garrison at Merca in 1904, and repeatedly ambushed and attacked Italian-led troops. The Italian administra¬ tion decided to \"pacify\" the area, but the \"Bimal re¬ volt, \" which began in 1905, was not crushed until 1908. In their \"revolt, \" the Bimal gained some as¬ sistance in the way of firearms from Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan, the Salihiya leader of the jihad in the north. Some of the Salihiya followers in the south broke with the Sayyid in 1908 after he was denounced by the Salihiya leader in Mecca, and the split among the Salihiya undoubtedly worked to the advantage of the Italians in \"pacifying\" the Bimal. In these battles, the Italians appear to have received some assistance from the Geledi sultan. See HAJI ABDI ABIKAR.\n\nBIO.\n\nSomali word meaning water; a metaphor for prosperity. See also WELLS.\n\nBIRTH RITES. Traditionally, the umbilical cord is tied with hairs from a camel’s or cow's tail, and the animal from which the hairs are taken becomes the property of the child. The child remains in the mother's house one year, at which time the kalaqad ceremony takes place. In this ceremony, the baby boy's maternal uncle or the baby girl's maternal aunt places the baby on his or her shoulders, carries it outside the enclo¬ sure, and then returns it to the mother, who puts the baby in its sling on her back. After childbirth, the mother stays in the house for a purification period of 40 days, during which she does not work or have con¬ jugal relations. The child's name is customarily given by the father without any particular name-giving ceremony. Children are members of the father's dia-paying group — not the mother's. For male children, a banquet is traditionally held, and gifts are provided to the Yibir {q. v.) who carries out magical rites and prepares an amulet, which is tied around the child's neck. These traditional ceremonies are most common among the nomadic groups. In modern times they are often ignored or modified. BLOOD COMPENSATION. The Somali word is mag; the Arabic dia is commonly used. Homicide is \"the chief offense for which blood compensation is required under Islamic law. Lesser offenses include wounds and in¬ sults. Blood compensation, which involves group\n\n25\n\nBogor\n\nresponsibility for the payment and receipt of fines, us¬ ually in livestock, is now illegal. See DIA; DIA-PAYING GROUPS. BOGOR OSMAN MAHMOUD (1854-1943). Bogor is a chiefly title, meaning 'Tbelt\"--to bind people together. Bogor Osman Mahmoud was a powerful sultan among the Mijerteyn; he is remembered for his resistance to the Italians. See MIJERTEYN. BOUNDARIES. The Republic is bounded by Ethiopia and Kenya on the west and southwest and by the French Territory of the Afars and Issas on the northwest. It faces the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean on the north, east, and south. The interior boundaries are rather arbitrarily drawn straight lines laid down during the colonial period, cutting through Somali-inhabited territory and dividing the Somali people. During the trusteeship period, unsuccessful efforts were made to define the boundary between Ethiopia and the Southern Region, which is now marked by the Provisional Ad¬ ministrative Line laid down by the British and Ethiopi¬ ans in 1950.

A coastal city in the South founded probably in the 10th century by Arabs or Persians and governed at that time by a council of chiefs. More Arab and Persian immigrants came to Brava, and by the 12th or early 13th century, Somalis from the north were moving in. By the 15th century, Brava rivaled Mogadishu as a center of trade. In 1503, Portuguese seamen captured vessels carrying some of the leaders of Brava and forced them to place the city under Portuguese protec¬ tion. When the leaders repudiated the agreement in 1506, Portuguese ships bombarded the town and looted it. Brava was defeated, and remained under Portu¬ guese domination until the middle of the 17th century, when the Iman of Oman ousted the Portuguese. The city then remained under the nominal control of the Sultans of Oman and Zanzibar until 1888 and was the center of Zanzibari government for the Benadir Coast. In the 17th century, the Tunni Somali arrived in the environs of Brava. Thereafter, they and the descendants of the original Arab and Persian inhabi¬ tants, who had intermarried with Negroid and Somali\n\n26\n\nBride Wealth\n\ngroups, constituted the city's permanent inhabitants. In 1840, the city was attacked by the tariqa of Bardera, which found allies among the BimaL In-rebuffing this attack, the Tunni allied themselves with the Geledi, who ruled the hinterland beyond the port. Brava was some¬ thing of a pawn in the later Bimal-Geledi wars, and in 1871 appealed to the Sultan of Zanzibar for protection. In 1875, Egyptian warships appeared at Brava. They withdrew a year later, under pressure from the British, and the Zanzibari increased their force and built a wall around the city. In 1888, the Imperial British East Africa Com¬ pany obtained from the Sultan of Zanzibar a 50-year concession to Brava and the other Benadir ports. Great Britain transferred this concession to Italy in 1889. Brava was administered by the Filonardi Com¬ pany (1893-1896) and the Benadir Company (1898-1905). In 1905, the Italian government purchased the Benadir ports north of the Juba River from the Sultan of Zanzi¬ bar and placed them under direct government control. From its earliest history, Brava was an im¬ portant center of trade, particularly for livestock and ivory exports, and was at one time the most important Benadir port. The merchants of Brava served as middlemen between Arabian, European, and American merchants (mid-1800s) and the peoples of the interior. When the caravan routes became disrupted, when there was a drought, or when the livestock of the area were struck by disease, Brava suffered. All these factors as well as the abolition of slavery and the development of other ports more suitable for ocean-going vessels combined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to undermine the city's prosperity and led to its decline. BRIDE WEALTH\n\nsee\n\nMARRIAGE\n\nBRITISH EAST INDIA COMPANY. This company, seeking to use the harbor of Obock (in the present French Terri¬ tory of the Afars and Issas), concluded treaties with the Sultan of Tajura in 1840 and acquired two small islands from him. In 1827, the company had signed commer¬ cial treaties with Somali sultans and sheikhs on the Gulf of Aden coast. BRITISH MILITARY ADMINISTRATION (BMA). In 1941, after the Italians were defeated by the British in Ethi¬ opia and in the Somali areas, the British Military\n\n27\n\nBritish Somaliland\n\nAdministration was established. It governed British Somaliland and the Haud and \"reserved” area (until 1948, when it was replaced by a civilian government), the former Italian colony (until 1950), and the Somaliinhabited Ogaden area of Ethiopia (until 1949). After World War II, the BMA attempted to modernize the government and court system in the former Italian colony. It established a number of new schools for boys and girls, opened schools for nurses and teachers, permitted the formation of political parties, organized the Somalia gendarmerie, and set up a police school. It encouraged the plantations to renew their production, and during this period, the former colony became almost self-sufficient in food. Also in the British protectorate of Somaliland, the BMA moved to modernize. It established Subordi¬ nate Courts; set up local advisory councils to discuss such economic problems as water shortages, food scarcities, and unemployment, and, in 194 6, inaugu¬ rated a Protectorate Advisory Council consisting of Somali delegates from each district. BRITISH SOMALILAND. On June 26, 1960, the British Somaliland protectorate became the independent state of Somaliland. On July 1, 1960, it amalgamated with the newly independent state of Somalia, the former Italian colony and United Nations Trust Territory, to form the Somali Republic. Within the Republic, the former pro¬ tectorate is referred to as the Northern Region. Early British interest in the area was related to the need to keep open the interior trade routes to Berbera, Zeila, and other ports which supplied the British colony of Aden with supplies of fresh meat. After the Egyptians evacuated the ports in 1884, Bri¬ tain signed trade and protection treaties with several Somali clans. Later treaties established the protecto¬ rate in 1887, with Berbera as the center of govern¬ ment. From 1899 to 1920, the protectorate govern¬ ment was concerned primarily with its continuing con¬ flict with Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. After the defeat of the Sayyid in 1920, the government became more secure, but it did little to interfere in the So¬ mali way of life. During the 1920s, some pastoralists in the western part of the protectorate began to grow millet, and by the 1930s cultivation and pastoralism were both important activities in the western districts.\n\nBur Acaba\n\n28\n\nElsewhere, nomadic pastoralism remained the dominant activity. Each of the six government districts was headed by a British District Commissioner (DC), whose contact with the people was primarily through akils and stipended chiefs. The DC acted as magistrate and had under his control the illalo, or local police. The protectorate was overrun by the Italian army in 1940, but was retaken by the British in 1941 and placed under the British Military Administration until 1948, when civilian government was restored. In the meantime, the center of government was moved from Berbera to Hargeisa. After 1948, some progress was made in providing education, improving agricultural and veterinary services, and extending local government participation to the Somalis. In 1954, Britain signed a new agreement with Ethiopia, implementing the 1897 boundary treaty. The British withdrew from the Haud and \"reserved\" area, except for the retention of a British liaison officer, who was to be a link between the protectorate government and the British-protected Somalis who grazed their live¬ stock in the Haud several months of the year. The an¬ nouncement of this agreement, and the first public an¬ nouncement of the 1897 treaty, aroused bitterness and resentment among the Somalis, who believed that their territory was being given away. The British in the area were embarrassed; many felt that their govern¬ ment had betrayed the Somalis. A British offer to buy the grazing area was declined by Ethiopia. Somalis began to organize, hoping to retrieve the Haud and demanding independence. They received independence in 1960. With regard to the grazing grounds, Ethiopia--after initially refusing--decided to continue to allow Somali pastoralists to cross the boundary and use the Haud as they have been doing for hundreds of years. BUR ACABA. An inland town, about 100 miles northwest of Mogadishu. In 1968, a United Nations survey team re¬ ported uranium and other mineral deposits near Bur Acaba. Historically, Bur Acaba has been an important "
