        "text": "Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.\n\nDo not travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\n\nCountry Summary: Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.\n\nArmed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.\n\nReporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.\n\nDue to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to South Sudan.\n\nIf you decide to travel to South Sudan:\n\nExercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.\n\nAvoid travel along border areas.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.\n\nBe aware that photography in public is strictly controlled and you are required to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Information before taking any photographs or video in public – including while inside a vehicle.\n\nMonitor local/international news and consular messages.\n\nEnroll your trip in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).\n\nReview your personal security plan and visit our page on travel to high risk areas.\n\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nShare important documents, log-in information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Find a suggested list of such documents here.\n\nEstablish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.\n\nDevelop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.\n\nBe sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.\n\nEstablish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nErase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.\n\nLeave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for South Sudan.\n\nU.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide consular services outside of Juba, even in emergencies, is extremely limited.\n\nLand mines remain a hazard, especially outside of Juba.\n\nArmed conflict between various political and ethnic groups continues throughout the country.\n\nExercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba.\n\nBe vigilant when traveling outside of cities and avoid travel along border areas.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.\n\nMonitor local/international news and consular messages.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.\n\nCrime: The population has ready access to weapons due to years of civil war, inter- and intra-ethnic conflict, and political unrest.\n\nIn Juba, the most frequently reported violent crimes include armed robbery, carjacking, and home invasion. Criminals target people who are walking, driving, traveling alone or in small groups, especially at night. Most criminal incidents affecting Westerners appear to target victims based on perceived wealth and vulnerability rather than nationality. Criminals frequently wear security service uniforms, carry military weapons, and use the ruse of security check points or official business to stop individuals or gain access to compounds.\n\nOutside Juba, road ambushes and roadside crime are common and often involve violence. Violent crimes (murder, armed robbery, home invasions, cattle raiding, kidnapping) and non-violent petty theft and fraud are pervasive.\n\nThroughout the country, crimes of opportunity include:\n\nMuggings\n\nPickpocketing\n\nTheft from vehicles\n\nFraudulent currency exchanges\n\nThefts usually occur near restaurants, banks, or other areas in proximity of foreigners.\n\nAvoid walking alone, especially after dark.\n\nDo not display cash or valuables.\n\nDress conservatively.\n\nDrive with doors locked and windows closed.\n\nTravel with a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\n\nReport crimes to the local police by going in-person to the closest police station and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(211) 912-105-188. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nTourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nSouth Sudan’s security services commit arbitrary arrests and often detain foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens. Extortion is common.\n\nSecurity forces often operate outside civilian control and do not always follow laws governing due process and treatment of detainees.\n\nU.S. citizens may have little recourse to justice should they be detained. Legal proceedings can be lengthy and subjective.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nSouth Sudanese law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals and dual nationals in detention.\n\nIf you have reason to believe a U.S. citizen may be detained or incarcerated in South Sudan, do not assume the Embassy is already aware. Contact the Embassy and provide as much information as possible.\n\nJournalism: Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan and have been killed while covering the conflict. They have also reported being detained with no due process or deported from the country with no warning.\n\nControlled Items: Certain items which are normal and legal to possess elsewhere are tightly controlled in South Sudan. Bringing them into the country without government permission, or even traveling internally with them, can result in extra scrutiny by security officials, the confiscation of your items, and your arrest.\n\nMetal detectors, which can be used for prospecting, are tightly controlled, especially if you are traveling to an area where mining takes place. Some forms of communication equipment such as satellite phones (commonly referred to by their trade names: Thurayas or Iridiums) are required to be registered with the government. Imports of any form of military material or “dual-use” items including their components are highly scrutinized, even if commercially available; this includes commercial drones.\n\nU.S. citizens should contact the Embassy of the Republic of South Sudan for questions regarding what equipment they may or may not import into the country and how to obtain authorizations for specific equipment or to bring in large sums of cash.\n\nDual Nationals: The Embassy recommends all dual nationals obtain visas for their U.S. passport covering the duration of their stay in South Sudan. If staying longer than a typical visa will allow, dual nationals are strongly encouraged to obtain a five-year residency permit. These documents are available for a fee at any local Government of South Sudan Immigration office.\n\nAid Workers: Consult with the security personnel representing your organization. Compounds housing aid workers have been breached and aid workers, including U.S. citizens, have been the targets of shootings, ambushes, violent assaults, harassment, and robberies.\n\nCurrency: The South Sudanese pound (SSP) is the official currency. It is a cash exclusive society. Carry sufficient funds in to cover all your expenses for the duration of your stay. ATMs draw on local banks only. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. U.S. currency that is damaged or issued prior to 2006 is not accepted.\n\nPhotography: For any photography, amateur and professional, a permit is required and may be obtained from the Ministry of Interior for $50. Even with a permit, you must be careful taking pictures, as police have arrested and physically assaulted tourists for using a camera. In addition, traveling with professional photography equipment will trigger extra scrutiny regardless of occupation.\n\nNever take pictures of government buildings, vehicles, or persons in uniform.\n\nDo not take pictures of infrastructure such as bridges or airports.\n\nKeep your camera concealed and do not take random photos in public.\n\nDo not take photos of South Sudanese without their permission and be courteous of those who shy away from having their pictures taken.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: Same-sex sexual relations are considered illegal in South Sudan with penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment, if consensual. If non-consensual, the penalty is up to 14 years’ imprisonment. Societal discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons is widespread, and there are no known LGBTQI+ organizations.\n\nSee our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: Women suffer from high levels of sexual violence, including abduction, rape, and forced marriage. The law does not prohibit domestic violence. Spousal abuse is common and police seldom intervene.\n\nSee our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nRoad Conditions and Safety:There are very few paved roads; most are narrow, rutted, and poorly maintained. Roads are often impassable during the rainy season (March to November). Pedestrians and animals in the roadways, excessive speed, erratic driving, lack of street lights, and overloaded or poorly maintained vehicles pose additional risks.\n\nWhen driving in remote areas, travel during daylight hours only and use convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the threat of roadside criminals. Carry spare tires, parts, fuel, and provisions. Service stations are separated by long distances. Professional roadside assistance service is not available.\n\nCheckpoints: Approach all vehicle checkpoints with caution, especially after dark or during times of heightened political or military tensions, and do not attempt to evade them. Even stops at checkpoints operated by the government of South Sudan may become hostile or violent.\n\nKeep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Anyone staffing checkpoints will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards.\n\nLandmines: Years of conflict have left the threat of unexploded ordnance, including landmines, as a hazard on or near major roads. Stay on main roads marked as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.\n\nTraffic Laws: An international driver's license and third-party liability insurance from the government is required. Those convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol face fines, jail sentences, and corporal punishment.\n\nAccidents: If involved in an accident resulting in death or injury, report the incident to the nearest police station or police officer as soon as possible. Remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly. Many local drivers are uninsured.\n\nPublic Transportation: You should hire private transportation from a reputable source. The use of public transportation (small buses, vans, or motorbike taxis “boda-bodas”) is off-limits to U.S. Embassy personnel and should be avoided whenever possible. Drivers of these vehicles frequently have little training and are reckless, and the vehicles are often poorly maintained. Schedules are unpublished and subject to change without notice. There is some public transit to rural communities by irregularly scheduled mini-buses.\n\nSee our Road Safety page for more information.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in South Sudan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of South Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page."
