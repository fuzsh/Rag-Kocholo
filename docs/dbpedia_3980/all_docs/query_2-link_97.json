During and before this time, Phoenicians and Romans exchanged knowledge, habits, and customs. In more recent times the Italians came to Lebanon in small groups during the WWI and WWII trying to escape the wars at that time in Europe. Also most of the Italians chose to settle in Beirut because of its European style of life. Only a few Italians left Lebanon for France after independence.\n\nLebanese-Italian Relations\n\nLebanon opened a legation in 1946, which was transformed into an embassy in 1955. Both countries signed a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Navigation in 1949. Both countries are members of the Union for the Mediterranean.\n\nItaly and Lebanon are linked by an ancient friendship, which finds its roots in their common Mediterranean heritage, their antique civilizations and thousands of years of common history, intense trade relations and deep cultural and human exchanges. In the 16th century, the special relationship between Emir Fakhreddine and the Medicis family of Tuscany was instrumental in forging modern Lebanon as we know it today, which is a unique mixture of Western and Arabic cultures. Lebanon also left important traces in Italy?s history: in 1584 the Maronite College was founded in Rome, fostering contacts between clergymen, researchers and young students, which today is being continued under the framework of Inter-University cooperation. This excellent level of bilateral relations between Italy and Lebanon is reinforced today by the common views of the two countries on a number of Middle East issues, and by the growing awareness that in a globalized world the two shores of the Mediterranean sea share the same destiny.[1]\n\nItalian Community in Lebanon\n\nThe Italian community in Lebanon is very small (about 4,300 people) and it is mostly assimilated into the Lebanese Catholic community.\n\nThe intermarriage in the Italian community is very high and most of the members are mainly half Italian via paternal or maternal side. Some of them are even converts to Islam or are descendents of converts. There are some Italian families who returned to Italy after the WWII together with their Lebanese born children.\n\nLanguage and Religion\n\nAlmost all remaining Italian Lebanese speak some Italian, while speaking Arabic as a first language and French and/or English as second language, and are Catholics. Their main organization is the Associazione Nazionale Pro Italiani del Libano (ANPIL).\n\nItalian Lebanese Antonella Lualdi in the poster of the 1960 movie Appuntamento a Ischia\n\nThe Italian Lebanese of the new generations are assimilated to the Lebanese society, and most of them speak only Arabic and French (with only a few words of Italian). In religion, most of the young generations are Roman Catholics, while only a few young girls or boys are converted to Islam mainly because of marriage.\n\nFamous Italian Lebanese\n\n* Antonella Lualdi, international actress\n\n* Gad Lerner, journalist\n\nFor original text with references see Wikipedia, \"Italian Lebanese.\" Notes: Italian-Moroccan\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nItalian-Moroccan Italians have emigrated in recent centuries in Morocco and their descendants.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Italians to emigrate to Morocco were some Sicilian from Tunisia in the second half of 'Ottocento.\n\nAlready in the census of the French Protectorate of 1913 were recorded in Italy around 3500, almost all concentrated in Casablanca. Italians after World War I is devoted mainly to trade and the construction industry in Morocco.\n\n\"Perhaps not everyone knows that the emigrants were Italians, mostly Sicilians, to\" build \"Casablanca. In 1911, the Italians who had settled in Tunisia, North African migrants in the lands particularly from Sicily and southern regions of the Peninsula, suddenly found themselves in a country ostile.L 'Italy had attacked Libya, and those that were considered brothers all became 'sudden enemies whose distrust. It was then that many chose to move to the more peaceful Morocco, where they had settled the French and where the demand for labor is not missing. Casablanca became an active and industrious city, which over time went filling stores and shops in France and Italy, still active today. [1]\n\nIn the thirties there were over 20,000 and a district predominantly inhabited by Casablanca, the \"Maarif\", said even \"Petite Italie (Little Italy, Little Italy) because over 60% of its inhabitants were Italian-Moroccan.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century Italians - for various reasons, mainly due to decolonization - began to move away from Morocco, reducing to about 2,000 at the end of the century.\n\nCurrently (in 2007) were 1628 Italians living in Morocco, according to government of Italy. [2] In addition, some 30,000 Moroccans have Italian ancestry.\n\nItalian community\n\nThe Italian community has had a remarkable development in Morocco occupied by France, that is, in almost one hundred years before the Second World War. Instead it was almost nothing the Italian presence in northern Morocco, controlled by Spain.\n\nIn the thirties there were over 20,000 Italians, Sicilians almost all concentrated in the metropolitan area of Casablanca.\n\nIn those years, important works, which still exist, were designed and built by construction companies led by Italy in the industrial and architectural buildings, cinemas and public works, such as the port of Mohammedia.\n\nIn the early fifties there was a small revival of Italian emigration, which had again increased community (reduced to less than 10,000 Italians in 1945, also by the fact that many Italians took French citizenship to be able to work without problems). Indeed in 1955 there were about 18,000 Italian-Moroccan, nearly all in Casablanca.\n\nWith the decolonization many Italians have left Morocco and now only half of the 1700 Italo-current flows from the Moroccan colonial community, since the presence of numerous technicians and managers of Italian firms operating in contemporary Morocco.\n\nIt should be noted that a group of nearly 300 Italians living in Marrakesh by the nineties, where they have successfully created activities related to the Italian and international tourism. [3]\n\nThe Italo-Moroccans in their entirety profess the Catholic religion. Catholicism in Morocco was much in the years following the French Protectorate and Spanish (about 600,000 followers in 1930) but is now reduced to a few tens of miglaia of the faithful.\n\nItalians belong to the Archdiocese of Rabat and churches as the main-Anfa Maarif, in what was \"their\" neighborhood of Casablanca, and that of Christ the King [4].\n\nItalian-Moroccan associations\n\nThere are some Italian Associations in Morocco, concentrated in Casablanca, but also present in Marrakesh (Circolo degli Italiani [5]) and Tangier (the Italian Hospital [6]).\n\nAmong the most important are the \"Circolo degli Italiani\", the \"Dante Alighieri\" and the \"Italian School of Casablanca\" [7]:\n\n* The Circle of Italians in Casablanca was the year of its founding in 1932 and was born with the name \"Circle of Italian Catholics.\" Immediately after its foundation were built premises, financed by a massive popular participation by the Italian Community of Casablanca (cha then had about 12,000 people). Il Circolo its specialized activities in sports, especially foot-ball and biking where it gained considerable success both locally and in the French Protectorate of Morocco. After 1945, lost much of its importance, and was reduced to a simple restaurant in the seventies for the few remaining Italian-Moroccan. Since 2002 a new management and is returning to be important between Italians and Europeans in Casablanca.\n\n* The first of the Dante Alighieri Committee was formed in 1932 in Casablanca, but the initiative had to succumb to the spread of war. A second failed attempt in 1951 and it was only since 1956 that the group could begin to carry out its activities on a sustained and appreciable, promoting Italian culture and language.\n\n* The Italian School of Casablanca began to work in the twenties, but after the independence of Morocco entered into crisis. From school year 1995/1996 began destatalizzazione Journal of Media and Elementary School in Casablanca for a strong reduction of pupils italiani.Dallo same year the School is managed by a Board of Management of Private Schools equal in Casablanca, which include Kindergarten, Primary School, Middle School, Liceo Scientifico and Istituto Tecnico Professionale Company. The school was attended in 2006 by a total of 320 students, of which 20 Italians and the remaining Moroccans. In 2007 was entitled \"Enrico Mattei\".\n\nLanguage and religion\n\nAll the Italian-speaking Moroccans some 'Italian, speaking in Arabic, Spanish, French as a second language, and are Catholics. The Italian-Moroccan of the new generations are treated to Moroccan society, and most of them speak only Arabic, Spanish, and French (with only a few words of Italian). In religion, most of the younger generations are Catholic, while only a few young girls or boys are converted to Islam.\n\nFor original text with references see English language Wikipedia, \"Italian-Moroccan.\"\n\nNotes: Italian Somalians\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nItalian Somalis\n\nItalo-somali\n\nFlag of Somalia\n\nPostcard of Downtown Mogadishu in 1936. At the center the Catholic Cathedral, similar to that of Cefalu in Sicily and now destroyed. Near the Cathedral, the Arch monument to the King of Italy Umberto I.\n\nTotal population\n\nRegions with significant populations\n\nMogadishu\n\nLanguages\n\nItalian, Somali\n\nReligion\n\nRoman Catholic, Islam\n\nRelated ethnic groups\n\nItalians, Arabs\n\nItalian Somalis or Italo Somalis are Somali descendants from Italian colonists, as well as Italian long-term residents in Somalia.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1892, the Italian explorer Robecchi Bricchetti for the first time labeled as Somalia the region in the Horn of Africa then under the control of the Arab Sultan of Zanzibar (a region referred to as Benadir). In April 1905, the Italian government acquired control (from a private Italian company called SACI) of this coastal area around Mogadishu, and created the colony of Italian Somalia.\n\nFrom the outset, the Italian authorities created a colonial administration (supported even by some Italian colonists) and reached agreements with the local Somali clans. In doing this, the Kingdom of Italy was spared bloody rebellions like those launched by the Dervish leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (the so-called \"Mad Mullah\") over a period of twenty-one years against the British colonial authorities in northern Somalia, an area then referred to as British Somaliland.[1]\n\nIn 1908, the borders with Ethiopia in the upper river Uebi-Scebeli were defined, and after World War I, the area of Oltregiuba was ceded by Great Britain and added to Italian Somalia.\n\nIn 1923, the fascist governor Cesare Maria De Vecchi started to assume control of the Somali lands after the progressive defeats of the then-ruling Somali Sultanates of Hobyo and Majerteen. In 1926, after a bloody repression, southern Somalia was pacified and started to enjoy a period of economic development. The Somali colonial troops called Dubats (and the gendarmerie Zapti?) were extensively used by De Vecchi in this military campaign.\n\nLuigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, founder of the main agricultural colony in Italian Somalia.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the new Italian governors, Guido Corni and Maurizio Rava, started a policy toward a friendly assimilation of the Somalis and their clans. Many Somalis were enrolled in the Italian colonial troops. Some thousands of Italian colonists moved to live in Mogadishu, that become a commercial centre with some small manifacturing companies, and in some agricultural areas around the capital (like Villaggio duca degli Abruzzi).[2]\n\nIn 1936, Italy then integrated Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Italian Somaliland into a unitary colonial state called Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana), thereby enlarging Italian Somaliland from 500,000 Km2 to 700,000 Km2 with the addition of the Ogaden.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1940, new roads (like the one called \"Imperial Road\", from Mogasdishu to Addis Abeba) were constructed in the region, as well as new railways (114 km from Mogadishu to Jowhar) and many schools, hospitals, ports, bridges, etc.\n\nIn the first half of 1940, there were 22,000 Italians living in Somalia and the colony was one of the most developed in Africa in terms of the standard of living of the colonists and of the Somalis, mainly in the urban areas. During the same year, Franco Filippini, The Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio, declared that there were about 40,000 Somali Catholics due to the work of missionaries in the rural regions of Juba and Shebelle.\"[3]\n\nIn the second half of 1940, Italian troops invaded British Somaliland[4] and ejected the British.[5] Italians even occupied the Kenian areas bordering the Jubaland around the villages of Moyale and Buna.[6] However, Britain retained control of Kenya, which included the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District[7][8][9].\n\nIn the spring of 1941, Britain regained control of British Somaliland, and conquered Italian Somaliland with the Ogaden.[5] From 1941, the British started to administer Somalia, maintaining the Italian bureaucracy.\n\nThis led to resentment between Somali nationalists on the one hand, and Italian Somalis on the other, the latter of whom wanted to preserve Italian rule after the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II\n\nIn 1945, the Potsdam conference was held, where it was decided not to return Italian Somaliland to Italy.[5]\n\nAs a result of this failure on the part of the Big Four powers to agree on what to do with Italy's former colonies, Somali nationalist rebellion against Italian rule culminated in violent confrontation in 1948, when a number of Italians and Somalis died in rioting in several coastal towns.[10]. The direct consequence of the 52 Italian Somalis killed in these riots[11], was the start of the process of reduction and disappearance of the Italian community in Somalia.\n\nItalian patrolled area (with Italian flag) of Somalia under ONU mandate in 1992 and 1993\n\nIn November 1949, the United Nations finally opted to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition?first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) (which later became Hizbia Dastur Mustaqbal Somali HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL), that were then agitating for independence?that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.[12][13]\n\nDespite the initial SYL's unrests, the 1950s were something of a golden age for the nearly 10,000 remaining Italian expatriates to Somalia. With United Nations aid money pouring in and experienced Italian administrators who had come to see Somalia as their home, infrastructural and educational development blossomed. This decade passed relatively without incident and was marked by positive growth in many sectors of local life[14].\n\nThe economy was controlled by the Bank of Italy through emissions of the Somalo shilling, that was used as money in the Italian administered region from 1950 to 1962.\n\nIn 1960, Italian Somaliland declared its independence and united with British Somaliland in the creation of modern Somalia.\n\nIn 1992, after the fall of president Siad Barre, Italian troops returned to Somalia to help restore peace during Operation Restore Hope (UNISOM I & II)[1] under the mandate of the United Nations, and patrolled for nearly two years the central area of Somalia around the Shebelle river.[15]\n\nBy the early nineties, there were just a few dozen Italian colonists left, all old aged and still concentrated in Mogadishu and its surroundings.\n\nItalian population in Somalia\n\nThe first Italians moved to Somalia at the end of the ninteenth century. However, it wasn't until after World War I that their number increased to about one thousand, a presence that primarily concentrated in the towns of Mogadishu and Merca in the Benadir region of Somalia.\n\nThe colonial emigration toward Somalia was limited initially mostly to men alone. Only during the Fascism was promoted the emigration of entire families, mainly in the agricultural developments of the Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi, near the Shebelle river [16]. In 1920 the Societa Agricola Italo-Somala (SAIS) was founded by the Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, in order to explore the agricultural potentials of central Italian Somalia and create a colony for Italian farmers.\n\nThe area of Genale in southern Somalia (near the Juba river) was another place where Italian colonists from Torino developed a group of farms, under governor De Vecchi, that were successful for cotton and after 1931 for banana exports.\n\nIn 1940, there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia, of whom 10,000 in the capital Mogadishu (called Mogadiscio in italian), for whom the Italian government opened some Italian schools like a Liceum.\n\nAfter the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, Italian Somalia was expanded by the Italian government with the annexation of the Ogaden region.\n\nItalian Somalis were concentrated in the cities of Mogadishu, Merca, Baidoa, Chisimaio and the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Shebelle (Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi).\n\nAfter World War II, the number of the Italians in Somali territory started to decrease and by the time of the Somali republic's independence in 1960, their numbers had dwindled to less than 10,000. Most Italian settlers returned to Italy, while others settled United States, United Kingdom, Finland, and Australia. By 1989, they were only 1,000 in total. Since the Somali civil war and the fall of Somali president Siad Barre's government in 1991, in Somalia remain only a handful of the old colonists. Many Italian Somalis left for United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Middle East.\n\nOf the latter, one of the better known Italian casualties was the former Bishop of Mogadishu, Salvatore Colombo, murdered in 1989.[17] This was followed by the murder of an Italian nun, Leonella Sgorbati, in 2006. With the disappearance of Italians from Somalia, Roman Catholicism was reduced from a record high of 8500 parishioners in 1950 (0.7% of Mogadishu's population) to just 100 individuals in 2004.[18]\n\nItalian language in Somalia\n\nPrior to the Somali civil war, the legacy of Italian influence in Somalia was evinced by the relatively wide use of the Italian language among the country's ruling elite. Up until World War II, the Italian language was the only official language of Italian Somaliland. The Italian was official in Somalia during the Fiduciary Mandate and the first years of independence.\n\nIn 1954, the Italian government established the post-secondary institutions of law, economics, and social studies in Mogadishu. These institutions were satellites of the University of Rome, which provided all the instruction material, faculty, and administration.\n\nAll the courses were presented in Italian. In 1964, the institutions offered two years of study in Somalia, followed by two years of study in Italy. After a military coup in 1969, all foreign entities were nationalized, including the university, which was renamed Jaamacada Ummadda Soomaliyeed (the National University of Somalia, or NUS).\n\nIn 1972, the Somali language was officially declared the only national language of Somalia, though it now shares that distinction with Arabic. Due to its simplicity, the fact that it lent itself well to writing Somali since it could cope with all the sounds in the language, and the already widespread existence of machines and typewriters designed for its use,[19] the government of Somali president Mohamed Siad Barre, following the recommendation of the Somali Language Committee that was instituted shortly after independence with the purpose of finding a common orthography for the Somali language, unilaterally elected to only use the Latin script for writing Somali instead of the long-established Arabic script and the upstart Osmanya script.[20]\n\nThe \"Banca d'Italia\" Building in downtown Mogadiscio in 1939\n\nUntil 1991, there was an Italian school in Mogadishu (with courses of Middle school and Liceum), later destroyed because of the civil war.

Gentile: the most renowned Libyan Italian\n\nTotal population\n\n1,000 (10,000 descendants)\n\nRegions with significant populations\n\nTripoli, Bengasi, Houn\n\nLanguages\n\nItalian, Sicilian, other languages of Italy, Libyan Arabic\n\nReligion\n\nChristianity, mostly Roman Catholicism\n\nRelated ethnic groups\n\nItalians, Arabs\n\nItalian Libyans typically refers to Italians, and their descendants, who have resided or have been born in Libya.\n\nHistory\n\nItalian heritage in Libya can be dated back to Ancient Rome, when the Romans (considered the ancestor people of Italians) controlled and colonized Libya for a period of five centuries prior to the fall of the Roman Empire and its takover by Arab and Turkish civilizations. But predominantly Italian heritage in Libya refers to modern-day Italians.\n\nIn 1911, the Kingdom of Italy waged war on the Ottoman Empire and captured Libya as a colony. Italian settlers were encouraged to come to Libya and did so from 1911 to the outbreak of World War II.\n\nIn Libya, the Italians in less than thirty years (1911-1940) built significant amount of public works (roads, buildings, ports, etc.) and the Libyan economy flourished. Italian farmers cultivated lands that were lost to the desert for centuries.\n\nLibya was considered the new \"America\" for the Italian emigrants in the thirties, substituting the United States.\n\nAn idealized image of the take over of Ottoman Libya by Italy in 1911\n\nThe governor Italo Balbo is attributed with the creation of modern Libya in 1934, when he convinced Mussolini to unite the italian colonies of Tripolitania, Cirenaica and the Italian Libyan Sahara in one single country named \"Libia\" in Italian.\n\nThe Italians in Libya numbered 108,419 (12.37% of the total population) at the time of the 1939 census. They were concentrated in the coast around the city of Tripoli (they constituted 37% of the city's population) and Bengasi (31%).\n\nIn 1938, the governor Italo Balbo brought 20,000 Italian farmers to colonize Libya, and 26 new villages were founded for them, mainly in Cyrenaica.[1]\n\nOn January 9, 1939, the colony of Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state. By 1939 the Lybian italians had built 400 km of new railroads and 4,000 km of new roads (the most important and large was the one from Tripoli to Tobruk, on the coast) in Libya.\n\nThe next year started the war between Italy and Great Britain, until the North African campaigns of World War II left Libya in British and French hands. All the Italian projects disappeared after the Italian defeat: Libya in the late forties experienced the beginning of the worldwide process of decolonization, that characterized the colonies of Europe in the fifties and sixties.\n\nHelen Chapin Metz wrote in her book titled Libya: A Country Study the following:\n\nOnce pacification had been accomplished, fascist Italy endeavored to convert Libya into an Italian province to be referred to popularly as Italy's Fourth Shore. In 1934 Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were divided into four provinces--Tripoli, Misratah, Benghazi, and Darnah--which were formally linked as a single colony known as Libya, thus officially resurrecting the name that Diocletian had applied nearly 1,500 years earlier. Fezzan, designated as South Tripolitania, remained a military territory. A governor general, called the first consul after 1937, was in overall direction of the colony, assisted by the General Consultative Council, on which Arabs were represented. Traditional tribal councils, formerly sanctioned by the Italian administration, were abolished, and all local officials were thereafter appointed by the governor general. Administrative posts at all levels were held by Italians. An accord with Britain and Egypt obtained the transfer of a corner of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, known as the Sarra Triangle, to Italian control in 1934. The next year, a French-Italian agreement was negotiated that relocated the 1,000-kilometer border between Libya and Chad southward about 100 kilometers across the Aouzou Strip, but this territorial concession to Italy was never ratified by the French legislature. In 1939 Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy. During the 1930s, impressive strides were made in improving the country's economic and transportation infrastructure. Italy invested capital and technology in public works projects, extension and modernization of cities, highway and railroad construction, expanded port facilities, and irrigation, but these measures were introduced to benefit the Italian-controlled modern sector of the economy. Italian development policy after World War I had called for capital-intensive \"economic colonization\" intended to promote the maximum exploitation of the resources available. One of the initial Italian objectives in Libya, however, had been the relief of overpopulation and unemployment in Italy through emigration to the undeveloped colony. With security established, systematic \"demographic colonization\" was encouraged by Mussolini's government. A project initiated by Libya's governor, Italo Balbo, brought the first 20,000 settlers--the ventimilli--to Libya in a single convoy in October 1938. More settlers followed in 1939, and by 1940 there were approximately 110,000 Italians in Libya, constituting about 12 percent of the total population. Plans envisioned an Italian colony of 500,000 settlers by the 1960s. Libya's best land was allocated to the settlers to be brought under productive cultivation, primarily in olive groves. Settlement was directed by a state corporation, the Libyan Colonization Society, which undertook land reclamation and the building of model villages and offered a grubstake and credit facilities to the settlers it had sponsored. The Italians made modern medical care available for the first time in Libya, improved sanitary conditions in the towns, and undertook to replenish the herds and flocks that had been depleted during the war. But, although Mussolini liked to refer to the Libyans as \"Muslim Italians,\" little more was accomplished that directly improved the living standards of the Arab population.\n\nLibyan Italians after World War II\n\nThe final defeat of Italy in World War II and the era of international decolonization fostered an exodus of Italians from Libya when Libya became a country. The Italian population virtually almost dissappeared after Libyan president Muammar al-Qaddafi ordered the expulsion of Italians in 1970. [1]\n\nOnly a few hundred of them have been allowed to return to Libya in the 2000s.\n\nIn 2006 the Italian Embassy in Tripoli calculated that in Libya there are approximately one thousand original Libyan Italians, mostly old people living in Tripoli and Bengazi. There are also many descendants (probably 10,000, according to estimates of Italian historian Vidali) of Italian settlers who married Arabs and/or Berbers, and Libyans of mixed Italian and Arab and/or Berber blood may be considered Arabs or Berbers.\n\nActually the Libyan Italians are organized in the Associazione Italiani Rimpatriati dalla Libia [2].\n\nMost Italian Libyans speak Italian, Arabic, and English, while only Arabic and a bit of Italian for the few assimilated of the new generations. In religion, most are Roman Catholic Christians but some dozen are converted Sunni Muslims.\n\nYEAR ITALIANS PERCENTAGE TOTAL LIBYA SOURCE FOR DATA ON POPULATION\n\n1936 112,600 13.26% 848,600 Enciclopedia Geografica Mondiale K-Z, De Agostini,1996\n\n1939 108,419 12.37% 876,563 Guida Breve d'Italia Vol.III, C.T.I., 1939 (Censimento Ufficiale)\n\n1962 35,000 2.1% 1,681,739 Enciclopedia Motta, Vol.VIII, Motta Editore, 1969\n\n1982 1,500 0.05% 2,856,000 Atlante Geografico Universale, Fabbri Editori, 1988\n\n2004 22,530 0.4% 5,631,585 L'Am?nagement Linguistique dans le Monde\n\nNotable Italian Libyans\n\nWell-known Libyan Italians (according to their place of birth):\n\nClaudio Gentile\n\nTripoli\n\n* Claudio Gentile (born 1953), international football player and coach\n\n* Rossana Podest?
