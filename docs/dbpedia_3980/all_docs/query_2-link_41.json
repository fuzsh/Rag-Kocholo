        "text": "For colonialism, the hierarchical structuring of society was a matter of administrative importance, but it left scars on the body of the societies of the former colonies. Italy makes landfall in Somalia towards the end of the nineteenth century, last in the race to colonize Africa, starting according to the usual script that envisages visiting travellers and exploratory expeditions seeking potential markets or dressed up as scientific studies. The earliest Italian explorers and travellers find an immense and sparsely populated territory with good agricultural and commercial potential, lacking any political organization or central administration which might give it political unity. A territory lacking even defined political frontiers, subject to the inroads of the army of the most famous and the strongest neighbouring African empire thrusting towards the Indian Ocean, which imposes tribute of produce on a population mostly engaged in pasture and agriculture and especially limited to the riverine areas as the country's only ready resource. The management and administration of the seaports and their adjacent areas (as stipulated by contract), but effectively only within accessible range, were allotted by Italy to private companies. These bodies, rather than ease the inhabitants' living conditions, give them a deal which is certainly no better—at least not for the majority. Between the end of the Compagnia Filonardi administration and the end of that of the Società del Benadir, events occur which are of extraordinary importance in the history of Italian colonialism and of Somalia; events which call for greater attention and historical analysis than can be given here. DOI: https://doi.org/10.31920/2056-5682/2019/v6n1a1\n\nColonization fundamentally reconfigured African space and hence fundamentally restructured the lives of Africans. In order to control local populations, resources, and markets, European colonizers drew borders, established centers of power and implemented administrative hierarchies that linked power to territory. The colonizers reconnected the continent through the development of transport and communication infrastructure and tried to direct the mobility of people, goods, and ideas. However, Europeans did not simply impose a new spatial order in Africa. Colonial administrations lacked the capacity to evenly implement their spatial strategies throughout their territories. Moreover, colonial spatial policies and practices were incoherent. “The colonial establishment” consisted of a diverse set of public and private institutions that operated on different levels. These different colonial institutions and administrative levels did not necessarily agree on spatial policies and practices. More importantly, colonial spatial strategies were negotiated with the different segments of African societies that contested, appropriated, and transformed space as conceived and shaped by Europeans. In addition, alternative spatial formations and narratives continued to exist or arose alongside the dominant colonial order. This article studies the early colonial history of the western part of the Central African Mbomu Basin through a spatial lens. It examines how this small region was subsequently incorporated into a series of African and European trade networks and empires and hence became part of different overlapping worlds. In particular, it examines the interaction between the local elite—more specifically the Djabir-clan—and the merchants and agents of empire that sought to control the people and resources of the western Mbomu region. Each of the three sections of this article juxtaposes the power relations and interests of the Djabir-clan with strategies and connections of outside agents on different scales. In the first section, I demonstrate how outside conquerors and merchants provoked a reconfiguration of the western Mbomu region long before the agents of the Congo Free State and France entered the stage. In the 1870s and 1880s Sudanese merchants established a network of fortified camps from which they governed Mbomu indirectly through divide and rule strategies, substantially shaking up local power relations and established connections between the region and North Africa. In the late 1880s Swahili-Arab merchants briefly established a similar network, this time linking Mbomu to the East African coast. Despite some ups and downs, Djabir—an initially insignificant Abandia noble—managed to lay the foundation of his power and wealth as agent of these trade networks. The second section highlights the key role of local elites in the formation of a colonial territorial order. As usual in colonial settings, the administration of the Congo Free State and the Belgian Congo relied on local elites to rule and exploit Mbomu. I substantiate this truism by focusing on the agency of the Djabir-clan, which managed to instrumentalize, challenge, or adapt the colonial strategies in order to expand and consolidate their own realm. Particular attention goes to the interplay of colonial attempts at territorial control and organization on the one hand, and the actions and strategies of Djabir on the other hand. The third section shows how the Mbomu region was gradually incorporated into multiple worlds, as Figure 1 demonstrates. The Djabir-clan gained much of its power and wealth through its ability to skillfully navigate the different spaces that overlapped in the Mbomu Basin. The Belgian empire was but one of these worlds. Reflecting this three-tier argument, this article contributes to the spatial turn in African history in three ways. First, it demonstrates that it is impossible to understand how the colonial spatial order was established without taking the spatial legacies of pre-colonial connections and interactions into account. In this regard, the Mbomu region resembles other parts of Africa such as Hereroland, where Afrikaner colonization significantly altered how the Herero perceived and organized control over their territory long before Germany laid claim to the region. Second, this article, drawing inspiration from case studies on Southern Gabon, Ovamboland and the Lake Kivu Region, applies an actor-oriented approach to the formation of a colonial territorial order, consistently interpreting colonial policies and the actions of local elites in relation to each other. Finally, in order to understand these actions, the local scale of colonial interaction in the Mbomu region is interpreted in relation to other scales of analysis or “worlds,” between which Djabir and his clan skillfully navigated."
