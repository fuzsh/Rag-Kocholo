        "text": "Those wondering what is the money in Italy should know that the official currency in Italy is Euro. It is a European Union country that's part of the Economic and Monetary Union. The banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 Euros are in use, as well as the coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents and 1 and 2 Euros. In case you're interested in what was Italy's currency before the Euro, the answer is the Italian lira, which was replaced in 1999.\n\nSicily Currency\n\nThe same money is used on the islands on the Italian mainland, so the Sicilian currency is also the euro. If you did not have time to buy euros before the trip, then you can do it at the airport immediately after arrival. However, the rate at airports (as well as in hotels) is much less profitable than in banks. Therefore, if you arrive on a weekend or a holiday when the banks are closed, you should change only a minimal amount and wait for Monday. Banks are open on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. with an hour break for lunch. Do not forget to specify the amount of the commission at the cash desk or the exchange office. It can reach 10%, and at airports - all 12%. Essential to notify that more than 500 euros can't be exchanged at a time. Having a passport is a prerequisite when buying currency.\n\nWhere to Exchange Currency in Italy?\n\nThe average exchange rate of the US dollar to the euro is approximately from 1 dollar to 0.88 euros. For faster and more accurate conversion of your currency into euros, you can use a currency converter:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can buy euros at the airport, hotels, and, of course, banks. Terminals for automatic money exchange are already quite common in large Italian cities. But in the whole country, this is still a novelty. And yet, even in small settlements, there are always enough ATMs (they are easily identified by the inscription Bancomat), where you can withdraw the amount you need minus the commission of your bank and the bank that owns this ATM.\n\nCashless payment in Italy\n\nYou can pay with a card in Rome, Milan, Venice, Verona, Naples, Rimini and other tourist centers almost everywhere. On the doors of cafes, restaurants and shops you will find stickers with a list of accepted cards (usually VISA, Master card, American Express, Diners Club) or the inscription \"Carta - si\". However, at gas stations, on public transport or in souvenir shops, it is much more often necessary to pay in cash."
