The Executive Board, at its Thirty-Thlrd Session in April 1988,\n\nafter considering document EB 88/33/R.19, approved an amendment to\n\nIFAD's Personnel Policies Manual (PPM) permitting IFAD to join an\n\nadministrative tribunal. During the discussions there were a number\n\nof members of the Board who suggested that the International Labour\n\nOrganization Administrative Tribunal (1LOAT) might be the most\n\nappropriate choice.\n\n2. Accordingly, as reported by the President 1n his openlng statement\n\nto the Thirty-Fourth Session of the Board in September 1988, the\n\nPresident had further reviewed the various posslbilities and the\n\nSec.retariat entered into discussions with the Secretariat of ILOAT to\n\nwork out the necessary arrangements. Subsequently the President wrote\n\nto the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO),\n\nformally indicatlng IFAD's intent ion to recognise the jurisdict ion of\n\nthe ILOAT.\n\n3. IFAD has been informed that its declaration of recogni tion shou1d\n\nbe approved at the next session of the 1LO governing body, which takes\n\nplace from 3 to 18 November 1988. Thus, by the time of the\n\nThirty-Fifth Session of the Board, IFAD's declaration of recognition\n\nshould have been approved.\n\nRecommendation\n\n4. To finalise thls procedure on IFAD'spart, the ILOAT Secreta r1at\n\nhas advised IFAD that it should consequently now further amend the PPH\n\nso as to specify the name of the tribunal. It ls therefore\n\nrecommended that the Board approve the following amendment to paragraph\n\n4.10.2 (h), as amended by the Board at its Thirty-Third Session, to\n\nread as follows:\n\n\"Cb) Should a mat ter affect fog an lndl vidua1 employee not be\n\nresolved as a result of representation under this procedure, the\n\nemployee may refer the matter for final determination to the\n\nInternational Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT).\" 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 III.STATUTE OF THE\n\nADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE\n\nINTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION j\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj Statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the International\n\nLabour Organization\n\n(Adopted by the International Labour Conference on 9 October 1946 and amended by the Conference\n\non 29 June 1949, 17 June 1986, 19 June 1992, 16 June 1998 and Il June 2008)\n\nArticle 1\n\nThere is established by the present Statute a Tribunal to be known as the International\n\nLabour Organization Administrative Tribunal.\n\nArticle II\n\n1.

tragic consequences of these phenomena in\n\nAfrica,\n\nNoting aiso that desertification is caused by complex interactions among\n\nphysical, biological, political, social, cultural and economic factors,\n\nConsidering the impact of trade and relevant aspects of international\n\neconomic relations on the ability of affected countries to combat desertification\n\nadequately,\n\nConscious that sustainable economic growth, social development and poverty\n\neradication are priorities of affected developing countries, particularly in\n\nAfrica, and are essential to meeting sustainability objectives,\n\nMindfui that desertification and drought affect sustainable development\n\nthrough their interrelationships with important social problems such as poverty,\n\npoor health and nutrition, lack of food security, and those arising from\n\nmigration, displacement of persons and demographic dynamics,\n\nAppreciating the significance of the past efforts and experience of States\n\nand international organizations in combating desertification and mitigating the\n\neffects of drought, particularly in implementing the Plan of Action to Combat\n\nDesertification which was adopted at the

limits of national jurisdiction,\n\nRecognizing that national Governments play a critical role in combating\n\ndesertification and mitigating the effects of drought and that progress in that\n\nrespect depends on local implementation of action programmes in affected areas,\n\nRecognizing also the importance and necessity of international cooperation\n\nand partnership' in combating desertification and mitigating the effects of\n\ndrought,\n\nRecognizing further the importance of the provision to affected developing\n\ncountries, particularly in Africa, of effective means, inter alia substantial\n\nfinancial resources, including new and additional funding, and access to\n\ntechnology, without which it will be difficult for them to implement fully their\n\ncommitments under this Convention,\n\nExpressing concern over the impact of desertification and drought on\n\naffected countries in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus,\n\nStressing the important role played by women in regions affected by\n\ndesertification and/or drought, particularly in rural areas of developing\n\ncountries, and the importance of ensuring the full participation of both men and\n\nwomen at aIl levels in programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the\n\neffects of drought,\n\nEmphasizing the special role of non-governmental organizations and other\n\nmajor groups in programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of\n\ndrought,A/AC.241/27\n\npage 4\n\nBearing in mind the relationship between desertification and other\n\nenvironmental problems of global dimension facing the international and national\n\ncommunities,\n\nBearing aiso in mind the contribution that combating desertification can\n\nmake to achieving the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on\n\nClimate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity and other related\n\nenvironmental conventions,\n\nBeiieving that strategies to combat desertification and mitigate the effects\n\nof drought will be most effective if they are based on sound systematic\n\nobservation and rigorous scientific knowledge and if they are continuously re­\n\nevaluated,\n\nRecognizing the urgent need to improve the effectiveness and coordination\n\nof international cooperation to facilitate the implementation of national plans\n\nand priorities,\n\nDetermined to take appropriate action in combating desertification and\n\nmitigating the effects of drought for the benefit of present and future\n\ngenerations,\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nPART l\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nArticle 1\n\nUse of
