        "text": "In 1960 a U.S. dollar sold for 620 Italian lire. If PPP held in 1960, what would the PPP value of the exchange rate have been in 1987 if Italian prices rose 12 times and U.S. prices rose 4 times between 1960 and 1987?\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nAnswer: If PPP held in 1960, the value of the exchange rate in 1987 would have been 1 USD = 1860 Italian lire.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nIdentify the given data\n\nWe are given the following data: - The 1960 exchange rate: 1 USD = 620 lire - Italian prices increased 12 times between 1960 and 1987 - US prices increased 4 times between 1960 and 1987\n\n02\n\nCalculate the relative price change\n\nTo do this, we will divide the price change in Italy by the price change in the US: Relative price change = (Price change in Italy) / (Price change in the US) Relative price change = 12 / 4 = 3 This means that Italian prices increased 3 times more than US prices during this period.\n\n03\n\nApply the relative price change to the 1960 exchange rate\n\nWe will now apply the relative price change to calculate the PPP exchange rate in 1987: 1987 PPP exchange rate = (1960 exchange rate) * (Relative price change) 1987 PPP exchange rate = 620 lire/\\( * 3 = 1860 lire/\\)\n\n04\n\nState the answer\n\nIf PPP held in 1960, the PPP value of the exchange rate in 1987 would have been 1 USD = 1860 Italian lire.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nExchange Rate Calculation\n\nUnderstanding how to calculate exchange rates is essential for grasping the impact of international economic changes on currency value. An exchange rate is the price of a nation's currency in terms of another currency. In our exercise, we calculated the hypothetical exchange rate based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory from the 1960s to 1987.\n\nThe calculation starts by looking at the initial exchange rate, which was 1 U.S. dollar for 620 Italian lire. To find the PPP exchange rate, we need to factor in how much each country's price level has changed. The exercise provided information that Italian prices increased by a factor of 12 and U.S. prices by a factor of 4 in the given period. By dividing these two factors, we can find the relative price change, which, in this case, is 3. Multiplying the relative price change by the initial exchange rate yields the PPP exchange rate (1 USD = 620 lire * 3, resulting in 1 USD = 1860 lire).\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe PPP-based exchange rate reflects the economic principle that in the long run, exchange rates should move towards rates that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods in any two countries. Keeping track of such calculations helps economists and financial analysts understand the true value of money in different economies and over time.\n\nPrice Level Comparison\n\nPrice level comparison between two countries is pivotal for calculating PPP. It gives us insight into the relative cost of living and the inflation rates between economies. This comparison is what we perform when we examine how much the price levels have increased in the U.S. and Italy, as seen in our exercise. The escalated price levels, by 12 times for Italy and 4 times for the U.S., indicate a change in the purchasing power of the respective currencies.\n\nInterpreting the Results\n\nThe relative price level changes show us how inflation affects the spending power of consumers in each country. If prices in one country rise faster than in another, as they did in Italy compared to the U.S. in this scenario, the value of the currency in the country with higher inflation will, over time, decrease relative to the currency in the country with lower inflation.\n\nThis understanding helps in making international comparisons of GDP, cost of living, and the setting of monetary policy. These comparisons can also guide investment decisions and negotiations regarding international trade.\n\nEconomic Indicators\n\nEconomic indicators are statistics about economic activity that allow analysis of economic performance and predictions of future performance. These indicators can be broadly categorized into leading, lagging, and coincident indicators.\n\nIn our exercise, the inflation rate is an economic indicator reflecting the change in price levels over time. The rate of inflation is a crucial factor in determining the PPP exchange rate. When using PPP, understanding the inflation rates (another key economic indicator) gives us a clearer picture of the overall economic health and currency strength. Therefore, the exercise's focus on the inflation of different countries directly correlates to comprehensive economic evaluation.\n\nInflation rates indicate how much the purchasing power of a currency has eroded due to price increases over time.\n\nExchange rates reflect the international value of a currency relative to others.\n\nGDP growth rates measure the rate at which a country's economy is growing or contracting, impacting its currency's strength.\n\nTogether, these indicators provide an integrated view of the economic landscape and are essential for making informed policy decisions, investment choices, and in assessing the overall health of an economy."
