Railroad shares were in mild demand at times, since a general expectation exists that wage increases will be offset at least in good part by advances of freight and/or passenger rates. Resistance points were encountered at times in some groups, and small waves of buying sometimes gave the market an encouraging appearance. But the rallies never held, and for the week as a whole large losses were almost universal, In the listed bond market trends were diverse, High-grade issues of the United States Government and the leading utility, railroad and industrial en- terprises of the country were steady throughout, fair profusion, with New issues were announced in which, due to the drought, wras a billion bushels receptions usually quite good and in some instances Other items which showed large excellent.

The general trend of the stock market this week was mostly toward lower levels. Aimless movements characterized trading in the short session on Saturday last and prices at the close were generally firm. On Monday little activity was present in the market, and what gains were recorded occurred at the beginning of the trading period. Pressure of a sort was applied in the afternoon session, and prices as a consequence turned lower. Profit-taking came to the fore on Tuesday, and values, as a result, turned from two to eight points lower, and in some instances 15 points for the day. Early weakness in stocks abroad, coupled with waning strength in the foreign metal markets, and commodities in general, were the chief factors in the decline.
