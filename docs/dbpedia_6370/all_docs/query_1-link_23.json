        "text": "Who controls film censorship in the UK?\n\nIn theory, local councils - borough and county councils for the most part - have the power to allow any cinema to show any film. In practice, the councils almost always follow the classifications given to films by the British Board of Film Classification (formerly the British Board of Film Censorship).\n\nExceptions to this are rare enough to be notable. In 1996, Westminster Council refused a licence to David Cronenberg's Crash, though it played in the rest of the country, and in 1998 Camden Council granted a licence to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which was later classified as 18 by the BBFC.\n\nWhat is the BBFC?\n\nThe BBFC is technically an autonomous industry body, which charges film distributors for the service it provides in classifying films.\n\nIt was set up in 1912 by the film industry as a self-regulatory body in an attempt to head off government interference. With a few exceptions, local councils gradually accepted its classifications as standard, establishing the BBFC as the UK's semi-official censor.\n\nSince then, its relationship with government has been based largely on a gentlemen's understanding: the BBFC keeps its classifications within bounds deemed acceptable to government of the day (with a close eye on public opinion). In return, parliament makes no move to set up an official body.\n\nIn 1984, parliament made the BBFC the body responsible for video classification in Britain. This has brought the gentlemen's agreement within the law. It gave the BBFC official status at last, but has also left it more vulnerable to persuasion from central government.\n\nHow does the BBFC make its decisions? When does it cut films?\n\nThe board operates to a set of guidelines published on its website. It has traditionally observed a distinction between what it calls \"manners\" - flexible attitudes on the part of the public towards things such as nudity and obscene language, and \"morals\" - immutable codes of conduct. This conveniently allows it to change its classifications if it judges that public attitudes have changed.\n\nThe BBFC is keen to highlight the role that public consultation plays in its decision making, and organises \"roadshows\" to both canvas public opinion and to justify its decisions.\n\nThe board cuts films surprisingly rarely, and very openly: its website lists the length of any cut, and the reasons for it. Most cuts are made at the request of the distributor, to squeeze films into a lower age classification (generally speaking, lower age classifications means increased takings at the box office). Films classified 18 are rarely cut, and generally only to avoid prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act.\n\nWho runs the BBFC?\n\nGood question. In theory, it runs itself as a business. In practice, it is very susceptible to influence from government departments, partly through its fear of being made redundant by the creation of an official body. The clearest example of this is the nomination of its president. Since the authority to classify films for video release is granted to the president of the BBFC as a person, the board's continued survival would be in doubt if it failed to appoint someone with Home Office approval.\n\nSo the Home Office calls the shots?\n\nNot any more. Since June 2001, responsibility for film and video classification has moved from the Home Office to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. In part, this is because the DCMS is working on bringing regulation of broadcast media, film and video under the aegis of a single body, Ofcom.\n\nWhat would this mean for film censorship?\n\nOne of the proposals is that Ofcom take over from the BBFC in its role as video censor. This would mean a substantial loss of revenue for the BBFC, and also raise the possibility of classification differences between the two bodies. The BBFC already has a stricter policy on video than cinema releases, but is at least consistent in itself. Ultimately, it is hard to imagine that a body created to regulate broadcast and video films would not eventually assume responsibility for cinema exhibition too.\n\nThe effect of having film censorship run directly by a government agency raises obvious concerns. Critics of the proposal predict many more knee-jerk responses to causes celebres, and less consistency over time as new governments are sworn in, bringing their own attitudes with them.\n\nAren't there laws about what can and can't be shown in films?\n\nThe Obscene Publications Act prohibits material which \"tends to deprave or corrupt persons who are likely to read, see or hear it\", and other laws apply specifically to video releases.\n\nThough very vague, the law is generally held to apply to anything which might encourage criminal activity by those watching it, especially if it encourages violence or sexual violence. Interestingly, the BBFC last year consulted the police as to whether car theft scenes in Gone in Sixty Seconds were likely to assist would-be car thieves. The police thought not.\n\nThe perceived ban on images of the erect penis and sexual penetration is largely that: a perceived ban. In fact, the BBFC has recently classified two films, Romance and Intimacy, which feature precisely those images."
