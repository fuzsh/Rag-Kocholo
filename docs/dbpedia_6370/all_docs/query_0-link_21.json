We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC) (Reference AH/J00457X/1). The broad objectives of our study, which ran from September 2012 until March 2015, were to investigate the history of the UK Film Council (UKFC), to examine its effectiveness as a model of public support for film and also to analyse what lessons can be drawn from its experience. Established in April 2000 but wound up at the end of March 2011, the UKFC was the key strategic body responsible for supporting the film industry and film culture in Britain for more than a decade. Our project investigated the UKFC’s short-lived experience as lead support body for film and the fundamental questions raised, in the wake of the Council’s demise, about how strategic interventions for film in the twenty-first century may be framed and put into operation. It is important to understand the scope and limitations of the present work. The Film Council became the head of a so-called ‘family’ of partner organisations – see Appendix 1. There is a separate tale to be told about this extensive network and how it operated. The present study, however, confines itself to what we have judged to be central aspects of the UKFC’s operations. There is no shortage of further work to be done. Our investigation involved extensive fieldwork, including some fifty interviews with key policy-makers, former UKFC personnel, industry analysts, leading film-makers and other prominent film industry\n\n4713_Doyle.indd viii\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\npreface\n\nix\n\nstakeholders. Our interviews (that, with only three exceptions, were conducted by telephone or Skype) were generally all audio-recorded face to face. All were professionally transcribed with full confidentiality observed where requested. We have provided the dates on which these interviews took place as well as their locations. In some cases, we have given sparser details than others. That is because about one-third of our interviewees chose not to go on the record attributably, a sure indication that for not a few the closure of the Film Council remains a highly sensitive topic. We have in all cases respected the wishes of contributors and in instances where we have been unable to directly cite our sources they have nonetheless very valuably informed our study. A small number of others – prominent players in the saga – chose either not to respond to our requests for interviews or were unavailable. In the fullness of time, we may expect further testimony to emerge – perhaps even in response to the pages that follow. We also conducted analysis of policy and strategy documents, board minutes, internal UKFC documents and reports (where accessible) and relevant academic literature. We gratefully acknowledge that several of the charts and figures presented in this monograph draw on data from secondary sources, including the UKFC, the British Film Institute (BFI) and consultants Olsberg SPI. In the course of conducting this study, we were struck by the extraordinary fact that no comprehensive archive had been compiled of the UKFC’s paper record to be handed over to its legacy organisation, the BFI. Nobody either at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) or the BFI knew how to lay hands on a full account of the Film Council’s decision making, despite repeated requests for information. Eventually, we did find that some material was held at the BFI and we are grateful to those who sought to provide us with access to this. However, as indicated in what follows, there are further documents, not least those relating to the tense merger negotiations between the UKFC and BFI in 2009–10, that we have simply not been able to see. We would recommend that, in the interests of improved public understanding of the workings and records of our publicly funded institutions, where possible better care be taken in procedures for record keeping and archiving in the future.

Discussion of film policy, past and present, revolves around three main themes: that Hollywood dominates the market: that the film trade has distinctive economic features, and that the film trade has distinctive cultural characteristics. (Dickinson and Harvey 2005: 420; emphasis added)\n\nThis chapter introduces the context within which the UK Film Council (UKFC) was conceived and would operate during its lifetime from 2000 to 2011. It asks: why does film policy matter? In seeking to address this question we analyse some of the key themes and concepts that are developed throughout the book, including the challenge for policy-makers of addressing both the economic and cultural aspirations for the medium of film and the film industry. In this opening part of our study, we explain why film policy is significant and assess the complex range of objectives surrounding public policy intervention to support film. Later in the chapter, we examine some international models of film support, specifically the French model, and contrast differing approaches, in particular the Hollywood model, towards sustaining national production industries. The final part of the chapter outlines the structure of the book.\n\nPolicy as Politics Film policy does not exist in a vacuum. Throughout this book we argue that the particular political context and culture of the UK has played a key role in shaping aspects of film policy over the years. We concur with Des Freedman who suggests: There is nothing predetermined about the personality of the media systems to which we are exposed. While the form a media system assumes at any one time is by no means the direct expression of the state’s political priorities, it makes little sense to ignore the impact of political actors and political values on the character of the wider media environment. (Freedman 2008: 1)\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 3\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n4\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nTo that end, the role of politics, both in terms of party politics and in the wider sense of how power is organised in a society, is an important part of the narratives that surround the development of film policy in the UK. Rather than viewing policy formation as a rather dry, technocratic process, we suggest that it is an often highly charged process, involving a range of political actors, stakeholders and lobbying interests. Understanding this context and the elements of both continuity and change in the political environment framing policy are all-important elements that run throughout this study and are examined in some detail in Chapter 3. The tension between framing film policy either through primarily an industrial or cultural lens has often bedeviled interventions in the film policy arena. As Maud Mansfield argued in 2009 in her report on film policy for the HM Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries Ed Vaizey: Film policy has rarely been able to square the economic and political desirability of a self supporting industry with a shared language market and an acknowledged dependence on inward investment from the Hollywood majors and/or their controlling of the market. (Mansfield 2009: 5) State intervention in the arena of film has been complicated somewhat due to the nature of an industry that has particular sectors of production, distribution and exhibition that, while part of the one value chain, often have complex and differing needs and priorities. Policy interventions also have a long history as a result of the international and complex structure of the film industry, providing as it does employment across a range of sectors from craft and manufacturing to the service sector. Yet the cultural importance of film, with its potential as a medium for projecting a range of distinct representations of nations and identities onto a global stage, has always been the underlying factor that has heightened its industrial importance in policy terms. As John Hill has argued: In this respect, UK film policy, for all its apparent industrial hardheadedness, has typically possessed implicit cultural underpinnings. (Hill 2004: 33) As we note later in this chapter, some institutions, such as the European Commission (EC), have rhetorically at least prioritised the cultural dimension of film in attempts to mobilise it as part of a cultural space in which a European identity can be expressed. But even in this policy\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 4\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n5\n\nenvironment, the industrial position of the film industry in Europe and its ability to act as a bulwark against Hollywood’s domination of the sector is also deemed a policy priority. Interestingly, whether or not the UK state should actually have a film policy has never been seriously questioned by the political class except, perhaps, during the 1980s when ‘rolling back the state’ in all its forms became, in rhetorical terms at least, the new political orthodoxy. For some scholars, such as Jeremy Tunstall (Tunstall and Machin 1999), the dependent nature of the UK film industry on Hollywood capital or US capital has resulted in policy formation being broadly defensive in strategy, as the UK attempts to deal with an economically more powerful industry in the US with which it shares a common language. While the shadow of Hollywood has unquestionably been a commanding factor in shaping policy interventions over the years, it has not been the only one.\n\nThe Culture–Commerce Dichotomy The perceived economic importance of UK film has been at the core of most UK state intervention in the industry from the start of the twentieth century. To explain why film policy matters in this part of the book, it is, to put it simply, because politicians (of all political persuasions) broadly believe that is an industry that matters to the British economy and Britain’s image abroad. Politicians and sections of the industry (more often than not the production sector) have always been keen to provide the evidence that substantiates this type of thinking. That means that film policy has always been, in part at least, an economic policy. In Chapters 2 and 3, we discuss in more detail how the Treasury has been either directly or indirectly a key Whitehall player in shaping film and film-related policy. In 2012 a report by Oxford Economics titled The Economic Impact of the UK Film Industry (Third Edition) commissioned by the British Film Institute (BFI), Pinewood Shepperton plc, the British Film Commission (BFC) and Creative England argued: Today the core UK film industry is a substantial industry, directly generating 43,900 full time equivalent (FTE) jobs and contributing £1.6 billion to national GDP [gross domestic product]. In employment terms, the industry is larger than fund management and the pharmaceutical and manufacturing sector. Furthermore, the overall trend is very positive with employment increasing since 1995, mirroring film production levels (particularly inward investment). Overall, when considering the film industry’s procurement, spending effects\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 5\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n6\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council from those directly and indirectly employed and its contribution to UK tourism, trade and merchandise sales, the core UK film industry supported a total of 117,400 FTE jobs, contributed over £4.6 billion to UK GDP and over £1.3 billion to the Exchequer (gross of tax relief and other fiscal support) in 2011. (Oxford Economics 2012: 6)\n\nFiscal intervention in film policy has tended to have a focus on boosting indigenous film production and capturing inward investment (usually in the form of US capital) to bolster film production and post-production activity. In the UK context, we trace the historical pattern of these interventions in more detail in Chapters 2 and 3. At this point, it is worth highlighting that the industrial or economic focus on film policy has often been in tension with a more cultural or educational dimension regarding the value and worth of film in society. In this connection, Margaret Dickinson and Sylvia Harvey have argued: Until the 1980s Britain followed the practice common in many states in Europe of operating parallel support mechanisms for film as industry and film as culture, justified by a mixture of economic and cultural arguments. (Dickinson and Harvey 2005: 421) Yet, the broader policy dichotomy between positioning film as an industry and framing film as a distinct cultural and artistic form has often bedeviled organisations and institutions set up to deliver what in practical terms have often become competing and contradictory goals and policy objectives. John Hill has suggested that embedded in these debates are also deeply rooted cultural assumptions around the status of film in contrast to other cultural and artistic forms. He argues: The ambivalent status of film – as industry, entertainment and, in some cases, ‘art’ – has also been evident in the application of film policy in the UK. Unlike the traditional arts, the cultural value or aesthetic worth of cinema has not been a given and film has therefore not automatically fallen within the domain of ‘arts policy’ (or, following its establishment the Arts Council). As a result, government policy and legislation directed at film has been driven by a variety of imperatives. (Hill 2004: 32) For example, the British Film Institute (BFI), set up in 1933, has viewed its remit as being that of a broad cultural agency, with educational and\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 6\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n7\n\narchival goals focused on nurturing and valuing a deeper understanding and support for British and international cinema. In contrast, the task of sustaining and growing the economic and industrial development of the British film industry has been allocated to a range of other organisations and institutions, resulting in an often fragmented and complex policy landscape with multiple agencies responsible for differing aspects of industrial and cultural policy. Over the years, of course, the BFI has had to adapt with changes in the political, economic and cultural environment within which film production, distribution and exhibition takes place. The BFI’s Film Forever plan,when laying out its strategic priorities for 2012–17 stated: Supporting British film and filmmakers is core to what we do. We will back new voices, new stories, new ideas and skills, enriching and diversifying British film production. (BFI 2012a: 4) In one sense, this ambitious aim for the BFI had been given new impetus by its change of status to become a funding body given the earlier abolition of the UK Film Council. This involved the transfer of new funding responsibilities to an established organisation that had been a cultural film agency, which in the past had itself allocated funds for specific types of British film. We return to these issues later in the book. In historical terms, intervention in film policy has mattered because of its perceived economic and cultural importance, not least to the various sectors of the industry that have lobbied to have their interests taken up by politicians.The challenge has been in realising often diverse goals through an at times cluttered landscape of institutions and organisations tasked with delivering on differing aspects of industrial and cultural policy related to film. Chapter 3 pays particular attention to this aspect of the policy landscape as we outline the particular policy context of the 1990s that led to the creation of the UKFC.\n\nDigital Challenges and Policy Complexity The shift from analogue to digital has been one of the epoch changing moments across the media landscape in the last decade or so (Meikle and Young 2011). The challenges and opportunities of the digital environment for the media industries have also raised issues for policy-makers as the pace of technological innovation has driven regulatory change across the communications industry. As we argue in Chapter 7, digital transformation for the film industry was initially\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 7\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n8\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nviewed primarily as something that would alter the economics of production and perhaps, latterly, distribution. However, the complexity of the digital environment and the ways in which patterns of media creation, consumption and engagement are changing have resulted in policy thinking having to stretch across a range of issues from new modes of content creation to distribution and intellectual property (IP) related matters. In the dying months of Gordon Brown’s Labour Government in 2009, Lord Carter’s report Digital Britain attempted to shape a policy framework for government engagement across a range of areas being reshaped by digital technologies. It argued: The public policy objectives in film remain the same in the digital world as in the analogue: widening the audience for cultural film and enhancing the sustainability of culturally-specific British films. But the emergence of digital technology in recent years has provided a vital opportunity to create a dramatic change in the cinematic experience, through greater access to an even wider range of films and other cultural experiences such as opera and music concerts. Crucially, it allows the deployment of new and developing technologies such as the re-emergence of 3D film. (DCMS & BIS 2009: 123) However, this general ambition actually masked a myriad of policy challenges being faced in a converging media environment for the screen industries, not least what is meant by the term ‘film’ in a digital era increasingly characterised by ‘screens’, ‘platforms’ and ‘content’. The complex policy challenges facing any state intervention to support the film industry, which could range across IP debates and into the relative merits of new distribution platforms and business models, was highlighted from an economic perspective by Oxford Economics’ report into the film industry in 2012: The rapid technological change in the creative industries presents both huge opportunities and challenges for the film sector. As noted in the Film Policy Review ‘digital technologies create the possibility of a paradigm shift in the creative and commercial potential of film’. The sector’s future will depend in many ways on its ability to react to, manage and exploit these changes, and succeeding in its efforts to reconcile the many emerging forms of content distribution and consumption with robust means of securing and appropriating the associated revenue streams. (Oxford Economics 2012: 92; emphasis added)\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 8\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n9\n\nAn example of the interplay between the cultural and the commercial as drivers of policy can also be identified in aspects of the Digital Britain report of 2009, where it was held: In film a system of cultural tax credits has long helped to sustain a wide range of films that speak to a British narrative, rather than the cultural perspectives of Hollywood or multinational collaborations. Other countries such as Canada, for similar reasons, extend the model of cultural tax relief beyond the film industry to the interactive and online worlds. CGI [Computer generated imagery], electronic games and simulation also have a significant role in Britain’s digital content ecology and in our international competitiveness. Each of these has the same capability as the more traditional sectors, such as film, to engage us and reflect our cultural particularism. They may in future have a cultural relevance to rival that of film. The Government has therefore committed to work with the industry to collect and review the evidence for a tax relief to promote the sustainable production for online or physical sale of culturally British video games. This work will balance any potential support with the need for fair competition and ensure value for money for taxpayers. (DCMS & BIS 2009: 121; emphasis in the original) One of the key shifts in focus concerning film policy promoted by the shift to digital has been a greater awareness of the audience and the changing patterns of media consumption and their implications for content producers. The UK’s Film Policy Review (FPRP 2012), for example, argues that it is only by better understanding the audience for film and how that audience is evolving in the digital age that the industry can succeed. While a concern about the audience is of course not new, and often has been central to policy on film education, for instance, it is interesting how the shift from analogue to digital has increased the importance of the audience in policy rhetoric around film, even if this has often been in terms of ensuring the commercial viability of the industry. Unquestionably, the digital context has ultimately increased the policy focus on the distribution and exhibition of film-related content, even if this shift has been some time in coming. The European Commission, in its European Film in the Digital Era: Bridging Cultural Diversity and Competitiveness report for the European Parliament, notes: The digital revolution offers more possibilities and flexibility for distribution and is having a fundamental impact on audience behaviour. (EC 2014: 2)\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 9\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n10\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nIndeed, as is discussed later in this chapter, when we turn our attention to European models of support for film, the 2014 EC report notes how, historically, the overwhelming focus of state aid in Europe for film has been focused on production with, in 2009, only 8.4 per cent of this aid spent on distribution and 3.6 per cent on promotion (EC 2014: 7). So, in policy terms, digital technology and the ways in which it is becoming embedded in aspects of production, distribution and exhibition of film have forced a reshaping of any public intervention in this policy arena. It has also highlighted the growing issue of ‘policy lag’, where technological innovation and change are happening at such a pace that policy formation or intervention struggles to remain relevant in addressing an evolving sector or industry. In his introduction to the sequel to the Film Policy Review published in 2014, the former Labour Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Lord (Chris) Smith notes how: [t]he Internet – once a perceived enemy, spawning huge piracy – is becoming a primary revenue source. Whilst piracy remains very much a live issue, the statistics are encouraging: in 2008 around 12% of consumer spending on media and entertainment was devoted to digital; by 2017 that is expected to have risen to around 50%. (Smith cited in FPRP 2014: 4) In other words, even two years on from the Film Policy Review (DCMS 2012), the nature of the impact of the Internet (as both a threat and an opportunity) and evolving patterns of media consumption make the future-proofing of any policy intervention even more difficult. When the gestation period for policy formation is particularly long, as is the case, in say, European Union (EU) media policy, then the likelihood of serious ‘policy lag’ increases. While the shift to digital both in the UK and across Europe has reframed some of the detail concerning policy intervention, the major paradigm shift since the 1990s has of course been in positioning film within the broader frame of creative industries policy.\n\nCreative Industries and Economic and Cultural Renewal (or Back to the Future) Despite the vagaries of political and cultural shifts that see some policy areas consistently given a high political or media profile while others become less important, the dominance since the 1990s of the creative industries paradigm in the UK policy arena has seen film remain positioned as a key part of the creative economy (Schlesinger 2007, 2009).\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 10\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n11\n\nDickinson and Harvey, preferring the alternative term the ‘cultural industries’, rather than the New Labour coinage, the ‘creative industries’,wrote in the 2000s that [t]he [UK] government has been clearer about the economic goals of film policy than cultural ones. And film has increasingly been seen as part of the broader strategy for growing the cultural industries and promoting the cultural industries. (Dickinson and Harvey 2005: 423) The key paradigm shift that took place in the 1990s that saw film policy become part of the broader policy narrative about the importance of the creative industries in re-energising the UK economy is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. In particular, we focus on the importance this thinking had on shaping the form and nature of what would eventually become the UKFC. As we noted earlier, the move from analogue to digital across media and communications has been one of the defining characteristics (and policy challenges) faced by these industries over the last two decades. So while film policy has remained distinct, it has also become part of a wider discourse on the role that the creative industries play in the broader economic and cultural life of the UK. The Film Policy Review of 2012 argued: [This] has been undertaken in the context of an extremely challenging economic climate, in the UK and globally. The recommendations in this Review are designed to help ensure that film, as a key part of the creative industries, is one of the sectors which plays a full role in driving growth, creating jobs and stimulating inward investments and exports. (DCMS 2012: 6) While the role that film plays in the cultural life of the UK is acknowledged and addressed in the review, the leading edge of the report focuses on the ongoing economic impact that film as part of the creative industries plays in the economy. In part, this emphasis also reflects the shift during the 1990s that saw the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) become the policy home for UK film-related matters. However, the Treasury remained an important part of the policy picture. For those in the DCMS who were fighting for its budget with other government departments in Whitehall, the economic arguments regarding the importance of culture in all its forms were always likely to gain more traction with the Treasury than arguments based on the intrinsic cultural value generated by film.\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 11\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n12\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nShifts in political emphasis that inevitably take place over time contribute to defining policy priorities. So, for example, in the EU, the industrial strength of the European film industry (specifically in relation to the challenge from Hollywood) may be a policy priority but the cultural dimension of film is commonly prioritised, as befits an organisation deeply concerned with European identity. Thus, the Commission argues: The audiovisual sector has substantial cultural, social and economic significance. It shapes identities, projects values and can be a driver of European integration by contributing to our shared European identity. The sector contributes to growth and jobs in Europe and is a driver for innovation. (EC2014: 2) Fundamentally, at a European level we may note a reordering of the cultural and commercial policy drivers that have been part of the UK policy context for film. It is evident that the policy dichotomy between commerce and culture has not disappeared in the digital age. It is also important to observe that even within any supposedly UK-wide policy environment, there is a need to factor in the diverse devolved politics of the UK. In 2010, there was a merger of the Scottish Arts Council (a cultural agency) and Scottish Screen (a screen industries development agency) into a new body, Creative Scotland. One result has been to make a distinct film policy in Scotland increasingly invisible. As a result, the production sector in Scotland has lobbied consistently since 2010 in an attempt to secure a higher policy profile for film within Creative Scotland. Review of the Film Sector in Scotland, commissioned by Creative Scotland, published in 2014, noted the cultural importance of film, but identified an industry at ‘something of a crisis point, with levels of production that are too low to sustain a viable domestic industry’ (BOP Consulting 2014: 1). It also argued that in the digital environment with a converging landscape [a] film agency – or even one focused just on television and film – would feel out of date. Markets and audiences have shifted considerably, even since the days of Scottish Screen, to a complex and changing pattern of content consumption. (BOP Consulting 2014: 3) The report called for increased Scottish Government policy intervention and leadership across a range of agencies in this converged sector including Creative Scotland. What this discussion highlights is the continual complexity of the film (or screen) support landscape, as differing support models move in\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 12\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n13\n\nand out of fashion (or simply return in a new format) and the recognition, particularly acute in small countries such as Scotland, that some form of public investment is crucial if these sectors are to flourish both economically and culturally. As Robin MacPherson has argued: What counts as a successful film (industry) inevitably means different things to different people. Nonetheless, when it comes to building a sustainable domestic film sector for cultural or economic reasons or both, small countries around the world face similar challenges in countering the hegemony of regional and global film ‘superpowers’. (MacPherson 2011) While the media landscape and the position of film within that environment is unrecognisable from the era of early state intervention at the start of the twentieth century, the core political reasons for intervention, or why film policy continues to matter, remain remarkably similar.\n\nInternational Models of Film Support As noted earlier, the international aspects of the film industry and the potential global reach of cinematic representations mean that many states choose to intervene in this area for a combination of industrial and cultural reasons. This section briefly situates the UK experience in relation to other international models of film support and alternative approaches to film policy. It examines and contrasts the UK approach with, in particular, the approach of the French state to film industry intervention, which in many ways has come to symbolise a broader European tradition of film policy. At the core of the historical and contemporary challenge for film industries across Europe is how best to compete with the economically and culturally powerful vertically integrated film industry that is Hollywood. A very notable characteristic of global markets for film is the predominance of output from the US (WTO 2010) and more particularly of films made by the Hollywood-based ‘majors’. The exceptional track record of the major studios in consistently dominating global trade in film or, more generally, the success of the Hollywood model reflects the fact that the major studios – Disney, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures Corporation, Sony/Columbia Pictures, Universal Pictures/Universal Studios Inc. and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. – are large, well-resourced and vertically integrated film companies with extensive control over film distribution activities in virtually all territories around the world (Doyle 2013: 105–10). With assured access\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 13\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n14\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nto distribution, the majors are able to commit significant resources both to production and to marketing or P&A (prints and advertising) so as to build awareness of and audience demand for a steady stream of big budget film releases. Strategies of risk reduction, including reliance on repetition (sequels) and stars, are commonplace (De Vany 2004). But, in essence, the key to the commercial success of the Hollywood majors is their ability to finance their own film productions, use their own international distribution networks, exhibit widely and often in outlets that they own, and then channel a proportion of profits back into new production in order to keep the virtuous circle going. To that end, public intervention in film industries across Europe has been an accepted part of the political landscape for decades. In some cases the cultural protectionist argument around language has been a driver of industrial policy and intervention in the provision of subsidy/investment in the production sector of the film industries across Europe. Thus, the challenge of creating and sustaining an indigenous film industry through direct state support and production incentive schemes is not unique to the UK but is one that is being faced by countries across the globe. Tunstall and Machin pointed out that ‘[Europe] has 101 separate industries – each with its own separate policy – across Europe’s more than thirty countries’ and, as such, ‘Europe’s national “film industries” have long had difficulty competing with the Hollywood “movie industry”’ due to a difference in ‘vertical scale’(1999: 215). Yet, although the economic and cultural domination of the US has long influenced not only UK but also European and global approaches to film policy, Hollywood is itself experiencing problems as ‘generous incentive schemes offered by other states and countries’ have resulted in half as many feature films being produced in Los Angeles in 2013 as in 1996 (The Economist 2014). It can be argued that with individual US states now implementing industrial film policies, the benefits of interventions and incentives are recognised even in the most selfsustaining of film industries. As Scott suggests, this is not necessarily a new situation: Even in the Hollywood film industry, which on first examination looks like the essence of free-wheeling market capitalism, there is considerable collective order in the form of influential business associations, powerful professional guilds, indurated social networks, conventionalized behaviours, and mechanisms for public provision of supportive infrastructures and subsidies, all of which help to strengthen the bases of the industry’s competitive advantages. (Scott 2000: 12)\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 14\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n15\n\nThe French Model The French model for film support provides an interesting case to examine, as not only has France succeeded in developing ‘the most prolific film industry in Europe’ but its approach differs from that of both the UK and the US in a number of ways (Albertazzi and Cobley 2010: 194). As noted by Broche et al., between 2002 and 2005 the EU member states ‘provided over €6.5 billion of state aid for film production, which helped to produce over 3,600 films’ (2007: 44). Of these, France provided the highest overall amount of state aid for film, followed by the UK and Germany, while more than 600 film support schemes were in operation across the EU (ibid.). Table 1.1 demonstrates that by 2010 to 2011, France produced more films than the UK and, perhaps more importantly, secured a domestic film share of more than 40 per cent in 2011. This is in stark contrast to the UK’s 12.8 per cent and Germany’s 21.8 per cent. Table 1.1 Country indicators.

Based on an overall commitment to film culture, Olsberg SPI notes how ‘France has developed a mature, stable and highly evolved system for the support of its film industry, with backing across the political spectrum’(2012: 43). This has largely been achieved through a consistent and ‘carefully crafted policy of support’ over a number of years that has been implemented by both the French Government and the French national film agency, LeCentre national ducinéma et de l’image animée (CNC)\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 15\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n16\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\n(the National Centre for Cinema and the Moving Image), which was established in 1946 as a ‘quasi-autonomous administrative body’ (Scott 2000: 2, 13). L’exception culturelle (the cultural exception) is applied to French film in order to protect it against competition from the international market and is supported not only by regulation but also by public opinion. While France has what can be understood as a medium-sized film industry, other smaller nations adopt a similar approach. For example, on outlining Danish film policy and support, Hjort (2005: 120) highlights how the Danish Film Institute (DFI) seeks to ‘assure the availability of artistically varied offerings within Danish film, which in turn will contribute to the articulation and development of cultural identity, Danish culture and language’. UK film policy differs from the French model in a number of ways, with four key reasons outlined in a comparative report carried out in 2013 by Creative Screen Associates. These are based on the UK: • Being made up of four nations – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; • Sharing a common language, English, which is also the official language of more countries than any other across the globe, spoken fluently by more than 25% of the world’s population; • [having] limited public and political priority placed on the arts and culture; • [being] an economy built on free market economics with state intervention determined by market failure. (Creative Screen Associates 2013: 2) The shared language between the UK and the US, as we note in Chapter 2, has been a key factor in shaping the often close economic and production links between these countries – although in reality it has often been an uneven relationship, one that has been characterised by a UK dependency on American capital and finance. The shared language has been both beneficial to the UK film industry and to its detriment. For instance, without a need to protect its national language the UK has acted as a subordinate to Hollywood over the years and been overly reliant on US capital to sustain its production base. Concerns about the subordination of the UK industry are reflected in the emphasis on ‘sustainability’ (as opposed to film as a form of cultural expression) that, as we will argue, strongly influenced the UK Film Council’s sense of mission, particularly in its early years. Moreover, rather than apply a consistent approach to film policy and support in\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 16\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n17\n\nthe manner of the CNC in France, our account of both the creation and closure of the UKFC and its relationship with the long-running BFI, illustrates the problems, contradictions and irrationality of film policymaking processes and practices in Britain. In this sense we suggest that understanding the particular trajectories of any policy intervention require an understanding of the often nationally specific political and cultural contexts within which these policy formations are legitimised and sustained. Film funds in France are generated through taxes collected on all films (not just French productions) shown across all platforms (including cinema tickets and Internet distribution) and a mandatory requirement for French broadcasters to invest substantially in indigenous films (see Creative Screen Associates 2013; Olsberg SPI 2012; Scott 2000). Indeed, part of the success of the French model can be attributed to a consistent and innovative approach in ‘adapting its regulations’ to help deal with the numerous threats that cinema has faced over the years in the form of television, video and online platforms (Albertazzi and Cobley 2010: 194). Not only has this helped sustain film production in France but the overall commitment to film culture has cultivated a substantial audience for indigenous film both in cinemas and on television (see Table 1.1). As UK film funding is reliant on a government grant-in-aid derived from general taxation alongside proceeds from the National Lottery, with no mandatory involvement from broadcasters, it is much more ‘vulnerable to changing government priorities, political orientations and economic recession’ (Creative Screen Associates 2013: 3). In 2010, UK public investment totalled £347 million while in France the total was £578 million due to both CNC and broadcaster support (ibid.). It is also the case that the cultural and commercial aspects of film appear more difficult to reconcile in the UK than within the French model. For example, in France there is a ‘refusal to distinguish between “cultural” cinema which would benefit from [state] aid, and “commercial” cinema, which would not benefit from it, starting from the assumption that every film is a cultural product’ (Bellucci 2010: 219). While this assumption may have informed the rhetoric of the UKFC, it did not necessarily translate into practice. With regard to film support schemes, France has a system of both automatic and selective subsidies for production funding. As outlined by Olsberg SPI (2012), automatic funding for French film production comes in two forms, both administered by the CNC. The first, le compte de soutien, is based on the market performance of a producer’s last film (in terms of French box office, DVD and TV sales) and paid out €66\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 17\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n18\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nmillion in 2010. The second, le crédit d’impôt, ‘is a 20 per cent tax credit on eligible French production costs (up to a maximum of 80 per cent of the budget), which is capped at €1 million per project; this was worth €40.4 million to French productions in 2010’ (ibid.). It should be noted that unlike the UK, in which only those films in receipt of National Lottery funding are now able to share in recoupment income, the French compte de soutien ‘benefits all French producers with films released on some or all platforms in the French market’ (Creative Screen Associates 2013: 7). By rewarding market success across platforms, this is just one method by which French subsidy schemes help support and create a sustainable independent production sector in a way that has so far eluded the UK. There is also the more recent addition of the French Tax Rebate for International Production (TRIP) incentive scheme for foreign productions shooting in France, which again offer a 20 per cent rebate but has a higher cap of €4 million per project. Selective funding, on the other hand, involves an advance against receipts, or l’avance sur recettes, which is an interest-free loan recoupable from income and can be awarded either before or after production. The CNC’s budget for this was €28 million in 2010 and €30 million for 2011. This is in addition to various other selective schemes aimed at supporting ‘development, co-production (German, Canadian), Third World cinema, or specific genres, including music and animation’, which total about €4.5 million a year (Olsberg SPI 2012: 44). Overall, it has traditionally been easier to access film financing in France, largely through the availability of ‘soft’ money, than in the UK, meaning that while the latter produces many more films on an annual basis, they tend to be low or micro-budget in scale. In contrast, French films have higher median budgets while overall production spend within the market is also greater than that of the UK (Creative Screen Associates 2013: 3). Approaches to co-production and inward investment also vary in both countries, with France creating an environment that supports the former while the UK has been particularly successful in recent years at encouraging the latter. France is a member of Eurimages, the Council of Europe’s cultural support fund, which was established in 1986 and ‘aims at promoting co-productions and the circulation of audio-visual works within Europe’ (Littoz-Monnet 2007: 52). At present, Eurimages has a total annual budget of €25 million (Council of Europe 2014) and, according to Creative Screen Associates (2013: 4), France’s membership of the scheme ‘generates a 400% return on its estimated membership fee in terms of the film finance investment secured for French co-productions’. The UK, on the other hand, joined the scheme in 1992\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 18\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n19\n\nonly to withdraw in 1996 despite protests from British film-makers (Magor and Schlesinger 2009: 304). So far, successive governments of different political persuasions have failed to make a clear commitment to rejoin. Both countries are members of the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production, however, along with forty-one other countries, with the BFI and CNC currently offering £1 million and €4.19 million, respectively, for co-production support (Creative Screen Associates 2013: 4). While these amounts are indicative of the different priorities placed on co-production by each country, co-production levels in the UK have also dropped significantly since the introduction of the new film tax credit in 2006. The revised UK tax credit system has led to the UK devoting more effort than France towards encouraging inward investment, largely in the form of big-budget productions backed by US studios but qualifying for UK tax breaks. This approach ties in with the UKFC’s (2007a: 2) latter goal ‘to help make the UK a global hub for film in the digital age, with the world’s most imaginative, diverse and vibrant film culture, underpinned by a flourishing, competitive film industry’. A clear focus has thus been placed on skills, facilities and infrastructure that, along with financial incentives, seek to attract high-profile foreign productions. According to Creative Screen Associates (2013: 4), France is a ‘far less appealing destination than the UK for US inward investment productions’ for the following reasons: the UK production system has ‘closer synergies’ with the US than France; French crew rates are similar to those in the UK but ‘French fringes are expensive adding an additional 55 to 65% of costs’ in some departments; and the production process should be undertaken in the French language if effective communication is to take place across the entire project. As noted above, similarities with the US in terms of language and systems of production has in this case been beneficial to the UK film industry in successfully encouraging inward investment. It can be argued that the UK and French models of film policy are indicative of economic and cultural approaches to film, respectively. For example, Scott (2000: 31) notes how the fact that the French film industry is also regarded as ‘an institution embodying cultural values and perspectives that well merit public support . . . is a political judgement that French society has already made, firmly and unambiguously’. While the same cannot always be said of the UK, Hill (2012: 337) nevertheless states that it is ‘possible to argue that [UK] film policy has rarely been a matter of economics alone but has also depended upon cultural assumptions about the significance of film for the projection of national culture at home and abroad’. Indeed, he goes on to state that this ‘interweaving\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 19\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n20\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nof policy objectives’ became more evident during the UKFC’s tenure as lead support body for film (ibid.). Competing cultural and commercial objectives noted earlier within national approaches to film policy is something that we will engage with throughout the book, but it is important to note that Scott (2000: 27) believes that one of the problems to occur in relation to the French model of film support is a dramatic reduction in ‘entrepreneurial risk’ that ‘has been notably less forthcoming in helping to shape new competitive strategies or to create new synergies of a type that might promote superior levels of economic performance’. With the continued development of new media platforms and modes of delivery for films, along with ‘France’s generous support system to cinema . . . coming under the scrutiny of outsiders (the European Commission and the WTO)’, these are just some reasons why Albertazzi and Cobley (2010: 195) describe the French model ‘as a system “running out of steam”’, a view shared ‘even by its supporters’. It also worth noting that some film historians such as Jens Ulff-Moller (2001) argue that equating the success of the French film industry with the state’s ‘cultural’ policy does not stand up to detailed empirical investigation. Moller argues that the post-World War I grip that Hollywood exerted on the European (and French market in particular) through a combination of politics, diplomacy and aggressive monopolistic trade practices has never truly been challenged and that the quota system remains a blunt instrument in attempts to counter-balance Hollywood hegemony. At a European level, the EC’s review of the industry in 2014 noted that most of Europe’s film industry are in fact national film industries, with little significant movement of films produced in one market crossing over into another and that there are still ‘limited opportunities and incentives to internationalise projects and to target several [European] markets’ (EC 2014: 7). Thus, while film polices play out within often very specific national contexts, the generic challenge of competing with a vertically integrated monopolistic industry characterised by the US model casts a long shadow over film industries across Europe, both large and small.\n\nConclusion: Mapping Out the Research and Book Structure Against these broader policy debates this volume offers a specific case study of the UK Film Council and provides a probing analysis into the operation, politics, governance and performance of a public body\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 20\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nwhy does film policy matter?\n\n21\n\ndevoted to advancing public support for film in the UK. Our study seeks to provide an engaging account of the differing passions, aspirations and hopes surrounding film policy and public funding mechanisms in the UK. We also examine competing cultural and economic objectives and address the various tensions between regional, national, European and international interests in an increasingly transnational film industry. We aim to provide an innovative and up-to-date analysis of how a cultural funding body had to negotiate competing policy objectives over time and through shifting economic and political conditions. At a time of political change across the UK and unprecedented advances in the technologies of film production, distribution and exhibition, this book also provides an innovative searching examination of the key implications of changing pressures, and circumstances that are often unexpected and unpredictable, affecting models of public support for film. In doing so, it unravels the strategic role that frameworks of public support can play in helping both the film industry and film audiences exploit the advantages offered by the digital age. The book’s contents are arranged under four thematic headings that build logically from one to the next: Background; Agenda for the UK Film Council; Impact; and Strategic Lessons. This chapter and the one that follows form Part I, setting out key elements of the debate and, necessarily, a historical perspective. Part II – Agenda for the UK Film Council – builds on the opening two chapters by analysing the particular circumstances that precipitated and gave rise to the perceived need, in the late 1990s, for a new organisation to support film in the UK. Drawing on a wealth of original interviews with senior politicians, film executives, independent producers, industry experts and leading film-makers, it examines the key players, forces and assumptions that shaped the inception of the new body and its original sense of mission. Interviewees include Lord (Chris) Smith (former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport); all three chairmen of the UKFC, Sir Alan Parker (film-maker), Stewart Till (distributor) and Tim Bevan (producer); and John Woodward (the UKFC’s CEO). Chapters 3 and 4 thus trace the history of the UK Film Council (UKFC) by investigating those who drove its agenda, which objectives were prioritised and how and why the weighting of these changed over time. In particular, it examines how a national film agency relates to transnational political, economic and cultural spaces. Part III – Impact – investigates and analyses the performance of the Council across a number of key parameters. Chapter 5 assesses how effective this organisation was in fulfilling its remit, in negotiating competing\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 21\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n22\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\neconomic and cultural objectives and in satisfying the varying constituencies of interest that form the landscape of film provision. Chapter 6 focuses specifically on how successful the UKFC’s key funding schemes and initiatives were and asks whether the organisation offered good value for money as a support body for film. Chapter 7 considers the role played by the Council in helping the UK film industry adjust to a digital environment. Chapter 8 presents a probing analysis of the Council’s performance over its lifetime in relation to its key strategic objectives of advancing the economic prospects of the film production sector, promoting film culture and helping industry and audiences exploit the advantages offered by the digital age. Part IV – Strategic Lessons – analyses the circumstances surrounding the decision announced in 2010 to close down the UK Film Council. Chapter 9 draws on many revealing insights provided by leading film executives, politicians and industry stakeholders, reflecting on the significance of political contexts in shaping film policy outcomes and assessing the strategic lessons for the future design of film policy offered by the experience of the UK Film Council. Finally, in Chapter 10 we draw the book together by analysing the challenges faced by cultural funding bodies in negotiating competing policy objectives over time and through shifting economic and political conditions. Thus, the book as a whole offers a significant and timely critical overview of the contemporary policy environment for film in the twenty-first century. UK film policy has always been driven by economic and cultural concerns, with the emphasis often on the former. As new technologies and patterns of media consumption disrupt the media environment (the digital revolution) and policy paradigms move in and out of fashion (for instance, the creative industries) then the focus in film policy has reflected these broader shifts of context. The challenge for those organisations tasked with delivering on policy aspirations, has been that the state tends to expend more energy on measuring activity across shortterm political cycles rather than long-term time frames. Film policy continues to matter because it feeds into larger policy concerns regarding economic development as well as domestic and international projections of national and cultural identity. These are policy issues that resonate with the political class, which in one sense is where this chapter began. The next two chapters in the book look in more detail at the broader historical contours of UK film policy and the gestation and creation of the UK Film Council in the years up to 2000.\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 22\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nC HAP TER 2\n\nFilm Policy in the UK: 1920s–1979 Mr Cohen asked the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the Report of the Working Party on the Future of the British Film Industry. The Prime Minister: The Report of the Working Party, chaired by Mr John Terry, was published as Cmnd. 6372 in mid-January. Since then we have given careful consideration to its analysis of the position of the film industry in this country and to its proposals. The Government accepts the value of a strong British film industry, able to take its place in a competitive international market and providing audiences, here and abroad, with an up-to-date image of our society and of the quality and power of our creative artists. We have been particularly impressed by the two principal recommendations in the Terry Report, namely the need to strengthen the industry’s financial position and the need for a single new body charged with overall responsibility for all aspects of the industry’s activities. (House of Commons Debate, 29 March 1976)\n\nThe Hollywood switch has tended to turn the British film industry on for one decade and off for the next. (Tunstall and Machin 1999: 134)\n\nIntroduction The long forgotten Terry Report on The Future of the British Film Industry (HMSO 1976), set up by Prime Minister Harold Wilson almost forty years ago, highlighted the fact that the relationship between the British state and the film industry had at its core a concern with both the economic importance and the cultural role of film in British society. It is no surprise, then, to find that since the early part of the twentieth century that state intervention in the policy arena has, at differing moments, reflected and grappled with these often competing concerns. This chapter maps out some of the significant moments in the evolution of film policy as it relates to the business and infrastructure of the industry in the UK and takes us up to the late 1970s. Over this period, a clear pattern is evident in that the film industry and its specific relationship to Hollywood shaped various state interventions that were mostly aimed\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 23\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n24\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nat buttressing an indigenous industry and also focused on growing and developing the UK’s capacity to compete internationally. The first substantial state intervention in the film industry was the inclusion of cinema in the Entertainment Tax of 1916. This positioned cinema with other areas of popular culture such as the music hall. The state was keen to derive additional revenue from the popularity of cinema through a tax on cinema tickets, yet it would not be long before various British governments realised that the state would be required to put money into supporting the industry rather than see it solely as a source of revenue for the Treasury. The shared language with the US has clearly been critical in the relationship between the UK and US industries since the arrival of the ‘talkies’ in the 1920s. The UK has often been an economic bridgehead for the Hollywood industry as it strove to maximise revenues in the European market and beyond. The shared language has also become a touchstone for debates about the relationship between the film industry and aspects of British national identity, or indeed the importance or otherwise of creating a distinct ‘national cinema’ (Aldgate and Richards 2002; Leach 2004; Street 1997). The arrival of the talkies in the late 1920s had of course acted as an impetus for the UK industry as it could compete in the US market in a manner that was difficult for other language-bound industries, such as the French. By this time we already had significant intervention in the industry through the Cinematograph Films Act of 1927.\n\n1920s–1950s: Managing the Market The 1927 Act recognised the interrelationship between production, distribution and exhibition in the film industry and was driven by a need to protect the industry in Britain. In their seminal study, Dickinson and Street (1985) note how previous interventions by the state had been concerned with censorship or safety, but the 1927 Act under the auspices of the commercially orientated Board of Trade, with its imposition of quotas guaranteeing screen time for films produced in Britain, marked a sea-change in the relationship between government and industry. The Act was a response to a crisis that had seen the volume of British films being screened in the UK fall as US films became increasingly popular. British film production had fallen to a low of only thirty-seven films by 1926 (the figure had been 150 films just five years earlier) (Dickinson and Street 1985: 5). Film production would not reach such depths again until 1989, when only thirty films were made in the UK. By imposing screen quotas on exhibitors to carry British films, the ‘quota quickies’ were born. A British film industry that, Tunstall (Tunstall and Machin\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 24\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nfilm policy in the uk: 1920s–1979\n\n25\n\n1999: 134) argues, did not exist to any extent because of American influence in the 1920s, enjoyed an uneven period of growth into the 1930s, before flourishing in production terms during World War II as it benefited from considerable state support. The 1927 Act was the first significant state intervention that attempted to grapple with what would become a major structural issue for film policy over the coming decades (Low 1985). The problem was that Britain lacked the industrial scale and capacity necessary in its production and distribution companies to compete with the economic might of the American industry. While The Rank Organisation perhaps came closest to competing with the US conglomerates, particularly in the 1940s, ironically it would be fatally wounded, not by the market, but by the actions of British government policy (Dickinson and Street 1985; Murphy 1992). The post-war British Government of 1947 was experiencing a dollar crisis and as a result only allowed the Hollywood studios to extract 25 per cent of their profits from the UK economy. Given his later interest in the British film industry when Prime Minister, it was Harold Wilson, then President of the Board of Trade, who ironically was responsible for the import duty imposed on Hollywood films as Britain in the grip of a Sterling crisis attempted to retain as many dollars as it could. An American ban followed on sending US films to Britain, with Rank significantly increasing its level of film production in order to fill the gap only for the dispute to be settled and a flood of backdated Hollywood films then reentering the UK market in 1948–9. As a result, Rank’s production arm lost £3 million (Harper and Porter 2003; Macnab 1992) and the organisation learned an important lesson in attempting to compete with the US major studios. As an organisation it never took such risks again after this crisis. Andrew Marr argues that this fiasco was part of a wider political pattern becoming increasingly common in post-war Britain where [a]gain and again, Britain’s deep dependency on the United States was simply underestimated by politicians. (Marr 2007: 108) It also highlighted the often disjointed nature of governmental intervention into areas that impacted on the British film industry.\n\n1936: The Moyne Committee Dickinson and Street (1985: 47–52) document in detail the deep rooted tensions between the commercial film ‘trade’ and other sectors of the film industry as well as those parts of government that wanted to\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 25\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n26\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nenhance and develop the educational and cultural dimension of film in national life, particularly during the setting up of the BFI in the 1930s. This unresolved tension between viewing film from within the frame of either economic and industrial policy or educational and cultural policy is played out again and again over the years in policy circles. Policy also impacted on the industry in other more tangential ways. For example, the nascent years of television in the UK in the 1930s saw growing links between film companies and the new medium of television with the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation keen in 1937 to install a number of large television screens in its cinema theatres. However, while the film industry lobbied the government during the 1930s to allow it to broadcast television in its cinemas, this was rebuffed by the stronger lobby from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that viewed theatre television as a direct threat to its broadcast monopoly (Stokes 1999: 25). Significantly, it would be funding from public service television in the 1980s that would help prevent the film production sector from being wiped out as post-1979 Conservative Governments rolled back the state’s role in funding and financially underpinning the film industry in the UK. What is striking when reviewing the broad sweep of governmental intervention in the industry is the manner in which the arguments have a familiar ring regarding their key policy concerns. The Moyne Committee of 1936, for example, tasked by the Board of Trade with reviewing the success or otherwise of the 1927 Act, drew attention to financial and structural concerns that still resonate in policy circles. It noted: The British film producing industry has an insufficient supply of capital for its needs and . . . the cost of production of British films has been increased by the necessary money being obtainable only at a high rate of interest . . . Lack of finance is a powerful factor in enabling foreign interests to obtain control and is certainly an impediment to the industry’s continued and satisfactory expansion . . . The Government should, as soon as may be, take such steps as may be practicable to encourage financial interests to constitute one or more organizations to finance British film production, in approved cases, on reasonable terms. (Moyne Committee Report 1936: Recommendations) The committee was concerned with what it saw as the exhibition sector, in particular, being controlled largely by US finance; however, at the same time it sought to encourage US companies to make bigger-budget films in the UK (many US majors such as Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. had well-established British subsidiary companies). The Cinematographic Films Act 1938 reflected the committee’s thinking by extending\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 26\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nfilm policy in the uk: 1920s–1979\n\n27\n\nthe quota system but with greater emphasis on raising the quality of film produced in the UK. In reality, the 1938 Act had two main consequences. First, it enabled bigger budgets for British production, encouraging competition in the international film market. Second, and more significantly, it enhanced the trend for US-based film companies to set up subsidiary companies in the UK. For example, Metro-GoldwynMayer Studios Inc. (MGM) quickly followed Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation by establishing themselves in the UK and quickly enjoyed success with films such as A Yank at Oxford (1938; dir. Jack Conway) and Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939; dir. Sam Wood) (HL SCC 2010: 8).\n\n1940s–1950s: British Film Success World War II resulted in increased government support for the industry and was a period in which a number of iconic British films were released, such as In Which We Serve (1942; dir. Noël Coward), We Dive at Dawn (1943; dir. Anthony Asquith) and Millions Like Us (1943; dirs Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder). These films both reflected and significantly shaped British national identity in this time of crisis (Aldgate and Richards 1994; Landy 1991; Murphy 2000). For the duration of the war, film under the Ministry of Information (MOI) was viewed as key part of the broader cultural war effort, tasked with both maintaining morale on the home front and helping people make sense of the conflict within a framework that reinforced British values and identity. Perhaps for the only time in the century, the economic value of the industry was less important from a policy perspective than the impact that cinematic representations of the war and British identity may have on a growing cinema audience that, by the end of the war in 1945, was running at 30 million spectators a week (the figure had been 19 million in 1938). However, by the later part of the 1940s, some familiar concerns about the industry were resurfacing and again driving state policy interventions. The combination of a lack of private finance for the production of British films allied with the ever present concern at the dominance of the UK market by the US film industry helped shape the Labour Government’s Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act of 1949. This Act led to the establishment of the Eady Levy, which was a tax (initially voluntary, but made compulsory by 1957) on UK box office cinema receipts with proceeds divided between the exhibitor and reinvestment in new productions. The National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC), which was to facilitate loans for indigenous film production, was the main institution to emerge after passage of the 1949 Act.\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 27\n\n16/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n28\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nDespite these interventions and encouragement for international growth of the British industry the 1950s was a period dominated by a focus on a majority of films that tended to be either domestic comedies or war dramas. In retrospect, given the trauma of war, the success of the comedies that came from Ealing Studios (Barr 1980) was not surprising. It is also worth noting that a key figure in their success, producer Michael Balcon, was also credited as being instrumental in shaping the image they presented of Britain during the 1940s and 1950s. Andrew Marr argues: [Balcon] was the great interpreter of these years, second only to Churchill in crafting how the British remember themselves in the middle of the twentieth century. (Marr 2007: 119) Most of the cinemas that attracted the growing audience in the early 1950s were US-owned ABC Picture House, run by Warner and MGM, and Odeon and Gaumont, managed by Rank, which had become closely linked with Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (Sandbrook 2005: 118). This was the decade that saw Hollywood investment in overseas film production decline. In addition, television was starting to establish itself as the key domestic entertainment medium, and within a decade with a public service ethos embedded in both the BBC and ITV, television offered a range of domestic drama that would mean that the cinema audience wanted something different. This alternative was of course often provided by Hollywood drama and escapism. Yet despite these challenges Murphy argues that the period after 1949 was not as bleak for the film industry as is sometimes portrayed. The bid to make Britain’s film industry a serious rival to Hollywood failed, but there was a long and relatively prosperous Indian summer before serious disintegration set in at the end of the 1960s. (Murphy 1992: 230) It was the start of a new environment for film-makers in the UK, one in which television would play an increasingly important role. Tunstall, commenting in the 1990s, characterised the film-makers’ environment as one in which [they] live in the twin shadows of the Hollywood big six companies and British television. These individual British film-makers do make quite a lot of films, but their ‘films’ are typically low-budget productions only seen by small audiences. (Tunstall and Machin 1999: 132) By the late 1950s, the US industry was in a position to start investing again in overseas film production with the UK once again a preferred\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 28\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nfilm policy in the uk: 1920s–1979\n\n29\n\nand favoured location. As result the 1960s saw one of the periodic booms in the UK film industry, albeit one financed by US capital. The era began of what film critic Alexander Walker (1974) has called ‘Hollywood England’.\n\nAt the Whim of Hollywood: The 1960s and 1970s The 1960s offer us an insight into the paradox of the British film industry and its relationship to film policy objectives intended to sustain an industry. At one level, it is a decade of considerable success. It would be the era that introduced a number of international British movie stars such as Sean Connery, with the launch of the James Bond franchise in 1962 with Dr. No (dir. Terence Young) (although it would be the 1963 film From Russia with Love (dir. Terence Young) that would make Connery an international superstar). Other British actors were also transformed into film stars in the 1960s. Michael Caine’s break came with Zulu (1964; dir. Cy Endfield) and The Ipcress File (1965; dir. Sidney J. Furie); Peter O’Toole’s with Lawrence of Arabia (1962; dir. David Lean) and Richard Burton’s with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965; dir. Martin Ritt). British directors, such as David Lean, enjoyed further international success with films such as Doctor Zhivago (1965), while American directors were keen to work in Britain, often helping to consolidate the reputation of the production craft industry in the UK with films such as Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Thus, at one level here was the international British film industry mobilising indigenous talent and often bringing a ‘British’ perspective to films that were successful in the US. Indeed four of the Best Picture Oscars of the 1960s were ‘British’ films, including My Fair Lady (1964; dir. George Cukor) and the musical Oliver! (1968; dir. Carol Reed). Yet if one applies other criteria to measuring the success of the British film industry, it is evident that by 1967, 90 per cent of funding for ‘British’ films was dependent on US capital. Dickinson and Street (1985) note how the policy debates on film in the 1960s, from the 1960 Films Act onwards, were driven by Treasury concerns. They note how Lord Willis, President of the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain and director of two independent film companies, when speaking in a House of Lords debate in 1966, highlighted the paradox at the core of state intervention in film policy. He argued: Most of our film legislation has had the effect which is the precise opposite of its intentions. Far from giving British film producers greater independence and finance, it has weakened them. And far from preventing American domination of the British film industry,\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 29\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n30\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council American domination was never so complete and overwhelming as it is today. (Lord Willis cited in Dickinson and Street 1985: 239)\n\nOther film and social critics (Sandbrook 2006; Walker 1974) have viewed the 1960s success of US-funded British films as a short-lived, rather self-indulgent interlude in a long-term relationship of dependency with American capital. Sandbrook (2006: 382) argues that by 1967 the British film industry ‘was in serious trouble’. While Walker (1974: 395) quotes one Paramount executive as saying, ‘When the money began to vanish the American studios simply packed up and went home.’ The impact of this withdrawal of US capital was evident in the decline of production across the UK film industry in the 1970s. Not for the first time this financial dependency on US capital meant that as ever the position of the industry in the UK would be subject to the vagaries and whims of the domestic US film industry. As Dickinson and Street (1985: 240) note, from 1965 to 1971, on average the US flow of capital for film-making in the UK was running at £19 million per annum. However, from 1972 to 1979 the average flow of US capital was only £6 million. The reason for this shift was a combination of factors, including the near bankruptcy of Hollywood in the late 1960s as well as an increasing investment focus from the US studios in American television, as they attempted to alter their business model while domestic cinema audiences declined and the popularity of television continued to grow. In addition, a range of tax changes in the US meant lower returns on foreign investment and a greater focus on the domestic US market. In short, the 1970s was a difficult decade for the American film industry and, as a result, the investment that had buttressed and underpinned much of the British industry in the previous decade disappeared. In addition to the domestic crisis in the US film industry, the 1970s was also the decade when television became the centrepiece of domestic popular culture in Britain and cinema attendances dropped and at one point appeared to be in terminal decline. The film industry in the UK became a source of location sites for US films, still keen from time to time to use studios and highly developed craft skills in Britain. It was also a location for post-production work on films, not least those with special effects at their core, such as Star Wars (1977; dir. George Lucas) (later retitled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) and the lucrative James Bond franchise. As already noted, the Labour Governments of the 1970s showed a greater interest in film policy than their Conservative counterparts, with Prime Minister Harold Wilson, in particular, keen to intervene in reshaping the policy environment. However, the broader economic crisis that\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 30\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nfilm policy in the uk: 1920s–1979\n\n31\n\nfaced the UK economy during this decade, and the lack of available public finance overpowered any opportunity to develop a sustained policy focus on the area of film. The Terry Report of 1976 (John Terry was managing director of the NFFC from 1958 to 1978), with its call for a British Film Authority (a forerunner of the Film Council) indicates the direction of travel with regard to policy thinking in terms of support for the industry during this period. However, these initiatives failed to find support at that time, in part due to the wider economic crisis that the Labour Government was struggling with. Also by the 1970s, public service television drama, rather than film, was the medium that offered the dominant representations of British society, making sense of a country experiencing both economic decline and decreasing political influence in the rest of the world. While the idea of a ‘national cinema’ still existed in the 1970s in discussions of the role and influence of British cinema (although the supposed clarity of the meaning of Britishness would begin increasingly to unravel in this decade), the existence of a vibrant industry operating across production, distribution and exhibition was equally problematic and indeed the survival prospects of cinema in the age of television were equally unclear as the 1970s drew to a close.\n\nConclusions: A Complex Policy Field We have argued in this chapter that policy intervention in the UK film industry has been sporadic and uneven over the decades. It has often been defensive in nature and shaped by the role and influence that the US industry has played both internationally but also within the UK domestic market. Policy thinking by the British state has also tended to focus on the production base of the film industry rather than on the distribution and exhibition sectors of the industry. As Jeremy Tunstall in his analysis of the UK screen industries has argued: British film and TV entertainment has been defensive for the very good reason that Britain from 1920 was targeted by the American film industry as a key, or the key, export market. However, although the British film industry, and later both the BBC and ITV, adopted defensive tactics, there was never (and there still is not) an effective overall British defensive strategy for confronting Hollywood. (Tunstall cited in Tunstall and Machin 1999: 129) Another factor has been the unresolved tension within elite policy circles over the positioning of film as a distinct cultural form related to aspects of national identity and the framing of film as part of economic\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 31\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n32\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nor industrial policy. Indeed, this division runs like a fault line through much policy thinking. The classic dichotomy between film as art or film as commerce – while remaining unresolved – has tended to mean that policy interventions for the former are often made in terms that underline the importance of the latter, not least when it has been the Treasury that requires to be convinced of the value of film. British experience up to the 1970s suggests that the BFI had a marginal policy influence on the infrastructure of the industry (this was anyway beyond its remit), and despite various skirmishes over the direction of travel of policy, the overwhelming policy focus has been on the economics of the industry with the Treasury as one of the key shapers of film policy intervention in the UK. Despite any interventions by the British state, the film industry in the UK has never enjoyed the special status afforded it in some other European states, such as France, but neither has it been totally left to find its feet in the unforgiving environment of the marketplace. This is not to suggest that cultural concerns are excluded entirely from the Treasury’s approach. Economic logic alone may have suggested that there was not a purely financial case for any sustained support for the industry, given US dominance of the market and the lack of risktaking in the City to support the industry. Attendant cultural arguments about international prestige have hardly been absent. We began this chapter with a quotation from an exchange in the House of Commons about the future of the industry. The proposal, in 1976, by the Labour Government to set up a single film policy agency, the British Film Authority, that would make economic and cultural interventions (including defining British as opposed to Anglo-American films) faced opposition from various quarters and disappeared when Labour lost the general election of 1979 (Dickinson and Street 1985: 246). However, as we have argued in this chapter, when examining the policy relationship between various British governments and the film industry, it appears that if we wait long enough certain policy ideas will inevitably resurface. The next chapter traces the steps taken towards the creation of the Film Council by examining the shifts in film policy thinking that took place in the UK during the 1980s and the 1990s.\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 32\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nC HAP TER 3\n\nThe Creation of the Film Council Rationalisation of Government Support Machinery In the longer term, the roles of the Government support bodies will be reviewed in order to ensure that their strategies are coherent and well-targeted, with a stronger emphasis on developing the film industry. (FPRG 1998: 7)\n\nBut the worst thing, in my view, is that there . . . was a pluralism and a very effective British way of working that got lost. The fact of having activity in an unorganised or not over-organised way I think is . . . very helpful. And the British are very good at kind of ad hoc structures, much better than trying to design the overall body that will run everything. (Simon Perry, film producer and formerly CEO of British Screen Finance, Telephone interview, September 2014)\n\nIntroduction Cultural agencies such as the Film Council may be conjured into life by governments of one colour and unceremoniously interred by those of another. The Film Council’s creation owed much to the personal commitment of Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Lord (Chris) Smith in the ‘New’ Labour Government that took office in May 1997.1 As we shall later recount in more detail, another Culture Secretary – the Conservative Jeremy Hunt – was responsible for its peremptory demise, as a member of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat cabinet installed in May 2010.2 These individuals’ actions need to be set in the broader context of the history of British film policy outlined in Chapter 2, as well as the particular conjunctures in which they took their decisions. The present chapter focuses on the creation of the Film Council and its immediate pre-history. In significant measure, it is a tale of the role of policy-making elites and the use of favoured forms of expertise in determining the function of public bodies in shaping the film industry. As we have seen, film policy has a distinctive, long history, in line with two persistent governing assumptions: first, an emphasis on promoting\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 35\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n36\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nnational identity through cultural expression and, second, a need to keep inventing new forms of economic intervention in order to keep the film industry alive (Magor and Schlesinger 2009). Immediately after the May 1997 election, film became a special case of a wider creative industries policy (Schlesinger 2009).\n\nBefore and After the Downing Street Seminar?3 A significant change in policy came in 1979 when the Conservatives entered office and Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister. Over the course of its first five years in power, the new government set about removing economic support, thus transforming how cultural subsidies were distributed for film production. In 1981, the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC) was restructured and its state funding dramatically reduced. In January 1983, the quota system was suspended. Then, in July 1984, the White Paper on Film Policy suggested scrapping the Eady Levy and the NFFC altogether to further rid the film industry of ‘the paraphernalia of Government intervention’ (cited in Hill 1996: 103–4). These proposals were subsequently implemented in the 1985 Films Act along with the abolition of the Cinematograph Films Council (CFC). The NFFC’s assets were transferred to a private company, British Screen Finance Ltd, in which Channel 4, Cannon and Rank initially invested. Finally, in 1986, a fiscal measure, which had made films eligible for 100 per cent capital allowances in the first year, was phased out (Hill 1996: 103–4). As John Hill (1996: 103) has argued, the removal of economic support for film production ‘was not simply destructive’ because the effectiveness of the Eady Levy and the quota system had become increasingly questionable. The NFFC had long been regarded as an organisation constrained by ‘inadequate funding resources and . . . having to function strictly on commercial lines’ (Dickinson and Street 1985: 241), although it provided an important lifeline for independent producers. Meanwhile, the value of the Eady Levy fund, determined by cinema admissions, had decreased with the decline in cinema going. As producers received a proportion of the fund in relation to the box office success of a film, the fund tended to pay out to the more successful film-makers rather than those most in need. Similarly, the quota system had never proved to be particularly effective. During the 1970s, when the number of registered ‘British’ films dropped by half, largely due to the withdrawal of the US studios from British film production, many cinemas failed to screen the required percentage of indigenous productions (Hill 1996: 103). Meanwhile, some argued that the phasing out of the 100 per cent capital allowances tax\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 36\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nthe creation of the film council\n\n37\n\nshelter encouraged ‘those with gumption and ingenuity to [find] imaginative ways out of a desubsidised environment’ (Stanbrook 1984: 173). However, as economic subsidies for film were dismantled, no alternatives were proposed. It would seem that, taken in the round, economic measures did have an impact on output as, following their complete withdrawal, film production went into decline and in 1989 only thirty films were produced in Britain (Hill 1996: 109). The US studios had returned during the 1980s to make their own films but not to invest in British films. In 1986, £270.1 million was invested in British film production but this fell to £135.7 million in 1988 and declined further to £49.6 million in 1989 (Hill 1993: 209), with film-makers relying in the main on two key funding sources – British Screen Finance and Channel 4. On 15 June 1990, a seminar was held at Downing Street, chaired by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to review the film industry and consider future issues. According to the prominent film producer David Puttnam, twenty ‘senior representatives of the British film world’ attended and this meeting was a turning-point for the relationship between government and the film industry. The seminar generated a series of proposals that eventually resulted in the establishment of a new quango [quasi-autonomous nongovernmental organization], the British Film Commission, along with a £5m European Co-Production Fund and a dedicated tax break. A few years later, at the urging of Richard Attenborough, the then Prime Minister, John Major, agreed to National Lottery funds being used to support film production. (Puttnam 2010: 1) The seminar included discussions on US inward investment and the promotion of British films abroad. The head of Universal Studios, Lew Wasserman, was invited, indicating the importance of Hollywood in any debates on the UK film industry. Moreover, the position of the industry in Europe was also considered, given the launch of pan-European initiatives. Eurimages, the Council of Europe’s fund to support co-productions (Jäckel 2003: 79) began in 1988 and MEDIA I (the programme to stimulate growth and competition among Europe’s audio-visual industries) in December 1990. The government subsequently set up working groups to discuss the key matters, one being the use of fiscal incentives for production investment (Headland and Relph 1991: 1). In 1991, with the active backing of its director, Wilf Stevenson, to stimulate wider debate the BFI produced the ‘UK Film Initiatives’ series of pamphlets. This included Michael Prescott’s The Need for Tax Incentives,\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 37\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\n38\n\nthe rise and fall of the uk film council\n\nwhich argued that fiscal support was essential, alongside other forms of state aid, to encourage investment in British film production and enable British film-makers to compete on a ‘level playing field’ with other countries offering these incentives in Europe, Canada and Australia (Prescott 1991: 4–5). It has been argued that the momentum for change in British film policy slowed down when John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher as Conservative Prime Minister in 1991, reflecting uncertainties in the government about how best to proceed (Hill 1993: 220). Nonetheless, the initiatives put in place by Major’s administration during the 1990s had a far-reaching impact on film policy into the next century. In 1992, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, introduced fiscal support for the film industry in the form of tax relief covered by a clause in the Finance (No. 2) Act. Section 42 was also referred to as ‘large budget tax relief’ and provided incentives for films with budgets in excess of £15 million. Also in 1992, the Department of National Heritage (DNH) was established, with responsibility for policy in culture and the arts, leisure, tourism and sport. Funding opportunities for the arts expanded with the new National Lottery established by the National Lottery. Act in 1993. Regional Arts Councils were in charge of allocating the Lottery money to film projects. The distribution of Lottery funds was initially confined to capital projects and it took intense lobbying from some, such as Wilf Stevenson, director of the BFI, to have film accepted as a capital asset. However, the lack of private investment in the British film industry was an enduring problem and, in 1995, the then Secretary of State for Heritage, Stephen Dorrell, set up an advisory committee to explore the main obstacles to industry growth. The Advisory Committee on Film Finance, led by the banker Sir Peter Middleton, was subsequently formed with members from the worlds of finance and film. The committee reported in July 1996, pointing to structural problems in how the industry was organised, financial matters (including lack of expertise on film finance in the City) and an overall lack of communication between the industry and the City (Middleton 1996: 3). Meanwhile, the Arts Council of England (ACE) commissioned a report by Spectrum Strategy Consultants, published in May 1996. This explored the feasibility of film franchises ‘expressly designed to create vertically-integrated companies’ with a sustained level of output to encourage investment (BSAC/ PACT 2005: 9). Following film producers’ lobbying, ACE subsequently invited bids for £96 million of Lottery money. Just after the election of the ‘New’ Labour Government, these funds were distributed to three film franchises over a six-year period. The awards were made to The\n\n4713_Doyle.indd 38\n\n15/07/15 12:51 PM\n\nthe creation of the film council\n\n39\n\nFilm Consortium, Pathé Pictures and DNA Films, which were set up in May 1997. In retrospect, the Lottery allocated significant (but, as it turned out, insufficient) funding to support the work of the franchises. Pathé Pictures, the Film Consortium and DNA Films were part of the attempt to create mini-studios (Caterer 2011: 63; Magor and Schlesinger 2009: 303–5). The idea was to establish stable frameworks for the production, distribution and exhibition of slates of films. Vainly as it turned out, hopes were invested in the successful vertical reintegration of Pathé Pictures, the largest of the franchises, as a counterweight to the US majors (Caterer 2011: 64–8). If the would-be British studio model was highly under-capitalised, it still paid homage to the US. Regarding the franchises, James Caterer (2011: 50) has noted that ‘competition with Europe seemed to be a prime motivating factor’ for the creation of this funding stream. As we have seen from the way in which Hollywood has loomed large in its history, British film policy is not conceived in isolation from external considerations, although Europe is, and has been, of secondary importance to the US. Caterer (2011: 55) further observed that ‘building links with Europe or sustaining an infrastructure to sustain Hollywood blockbusters were only partial solutions to the industry’s difficulties, with the big question remaining: what measures could be taken to stimulate home-grown film production?’\n\nA New Body for New Times? In the period that immediately preceded the birth of the Film Council, policy discussion about film in the UK frequently referred to the underperformance of British films in domestic and international markets and to how ‘difficult it is for smaller countries to try and compete with the Americans’ (Middleton 1996: 2.2). So the immediate context in which the idea of establishing a new body began to take shape was one in which it was widely recognised that the ver"
