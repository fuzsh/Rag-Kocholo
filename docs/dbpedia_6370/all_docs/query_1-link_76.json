        "text": "Harry Potter has once again soared to the top of the UK box office after the biggest-weekend total sales in the UK.\n\nCatherine Shoard has written:\n\n\"Figures published today confirmed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the penultimate film in the franchise, made £18.3m between Friday and Sunday. In the US the film made $125m in its opening weekend and globally takings have been $330m – a remarkable feat for a series now in its seventh episode.\"\n\nThe success of the latest release has brought attention firmly back to the UK film industry.\n\nAccording to figures published by the UK Film Council Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was the best performing UK film at the worldwide box office, earning over $900 million in 2009.\n\nThe previous six films all make an appearance throughout the UK Film Council's top 20 UK films of all time at the UK box office, generating a combined £362.39 billion.\n\nWith the news that Warner Brothers are planning to buy Leavesden studios, the home of the Harry Potter films, for £100 million the UK film industry is now firmly under the spotlight brought by the Potter films. This has come at a time when the UK Film Council faces being axed by the government.\n\nFrom figures collected from the UK film Council and their statistical yearbook 2010 we have produced some interesting data to show the impact of the Harry Potter films on the UK box office. We have also mapped the top UK film studios according to the film council.\n\nDownload the data\n\n• DATA: download the full datasheet\n\nWorld government data\n\n• Search the world's government data with our gateway\n\nCan you do something with this data?\n\nFlickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group or mail us at datastore@guardian.co.uk"
