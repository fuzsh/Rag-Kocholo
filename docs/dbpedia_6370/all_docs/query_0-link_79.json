On board, Lisa meets Jackson Ripner and their attraction grows. But moments after take-off, Jackson reveals that he has Lisa's father's wallet that he swiped off his desk and his real reason for being on board. Jackson needs Lisa's help to kill the deputy secretary of Homeland Security who's scheduled to stay at the Lux Atlantic Hotel, the hotel Lisa is the manager of. If she refuses to help, Jackson will call his partner on the ground and have her father killed."
