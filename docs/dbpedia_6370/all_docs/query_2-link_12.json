Back in the U.S., Kyle's family adopts the dog, but teenage brother Justin (Josh Wiggins) has problems of his own and doesn't want the animal. However, Max may be Justin's only chance to learn what really happened to his brother. With the help of a dog-savvy friend, Justin and Max begin to bond, and set out to unravel the mystery of Kyle's death.",
