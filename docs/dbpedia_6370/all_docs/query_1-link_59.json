        "text": "The Studio launches film completion fund\n\nThe Studio, the dedicated film channel operated by Universal Studios Networks and the First Film Foundation have announced the launch of The Studio Film Completion Fund (TSFCF).\n\nThe project has been launched to provide up-and-coming British filmmakers with the opportunity to complete their short films with monies from a £75,000 fund.\n\nThe project has also received backing from successful filmmakers Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title, who will act as patrons and judges for the project, and respected movie publication, Empire Magazine, who will act as media partners.\n\nRunning for a minimum of three years on a rolling basis, TSFCF will finance between four and 10 films a year, with awards anticipated to be up to a maximum of £15,000 per film.\n\nAll completed shorts will be showcased on The Studio in the UK, across Europe on other USN television channels and to industry audiences in the UK and US. Every year at least one of these completed shorts will be released theatrically across the UK in UCI cinemas with a suitable feature film. In addition, and unique to this fund, one overall winner will also win a place on Universal Studios’ Filmmasters Scheme, which provides a unique opportunity for young filmmakers to go to Hollywood and gain first-hand experience of the industry through a series of special events, meetings and master classes with key players in the feature film industry.\n\nMarking the launch of The Studio Film Completion Fund, 'Danny and His Amazing Teeth', directed by Rachel Mathews, will be theatrically released nationwide exclusively in UCI cinemas with Working Title’s 'About A Boy' from Thursday, April 26.\n\nTim Bevan, Chairman of Working Title, said: “Both Eric and I are very pleased to be involved in TSFCF - it is a fantastic opportunity for up and coming filmmakers and essential if we are to continue encouraging home grown talent to pursue their ideas.\n\n\"We are delighted that the first completed short is being played with 'About A Boy', as this provides a unique platform for an aspiring filmmaker to have their work seen by cinemagoers across the UK. You never know, we may well discover the next Mike Newell or Richard Curtis.”\n\nFor an entry form, please send a SAE to: The Studio Film Completion Fund, PO Box 4121, London W1A 6TL\n\n(KMcA)"
