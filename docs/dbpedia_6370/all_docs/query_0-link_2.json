        "text": "British production company\n\nNot to be confused with Vertigo Entertainment or Vertigo Comics.\n\nVertigo Films is a British television and film production company based in London, England. Vertigo Films has been responsible for the production and distribution of Bronson, StreetDance 3D, and Monsters. It now focuses solely on the production of television series, with subsidiary company Vertigo Releasing taking over film distribution.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVertigo Films was created in July 2002, by producers Allan Niblo (producer of Human Traffic and South West 9) and James Richardson (producer of Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)).[2]\n\nDirector Nick Love (screenwriter and, prior to company formation, director of Goodbye Charlie Bright and The Football Factory) and distributor Rupert Preston (distributor of Chopper, Chasing Amy and Bride of Chucky, among others) joined a year later,[3] while entrepreneur Rob Morgan began investment in November 2004.[4]\n\nThe company was formed for the express purpose of distributing and producing two films, The Football Factory and It's All Gone Pete Tong. Vertigo Films's film releases were distributed on home video by Entertainment One.[5] Vertigo Films teamed up with Film4 and Ingenious Media in January 2008, to form a sales company called Protagonist Pictures.[6] They also own a post production company in Berlin called The Post Republic.[7]\n\nHaving built up one of the most successful feature film businesses in the United Kingdom, encompassing production, distribution, sales and post production, the company is now solely concentrating on television production.[8] Film distribution is currently handled by Vertigo Releasing, launched in 2014, for the sole purpose of acquiring films for release.[9][citation needed]\n\nIts first two shows, Britannia and Bulletproof, were commissioned by Sky, with both programmes renewed for a second series.[10][11]\n\nIn May 2021 Bulletproof was cancelled by Sky following extensive allegations [12][13] of on-set bullying and sexual misconduct against actor and executive producer Noel Clarke.[14]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision shows\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Broadcast date Executive Producers Broadcaster Seasons Episodes Britannia 18 January 2018 Jez Butterworth, Tom Butterworth, James Richardson Sky Atlantic 2 19 Bulletproof 15 May 2018 Noel Clarke, Ashley Walters, Nick Love, Allan Niblo Sky One 3 17 A Town Called Malice 16 March 2023 Paul Gilbert, Jane Moore, Peter Welter Soler Sky Max 1 8\n\nReleased films\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Release date Director Production company(s) Type The Football Factory 14 May 2004 Nick Love Rockstar Games[15] Production, Distribution A Good Woman 13 May 2005 Mike Barker Beyond Films[16] Distribution It's All Gone Pete Tong 27 May 2005 Michael Dowse True West Films / Redbus Film Distribution[17][18] Production Clean 1 July 2005 Olivier Assayas UK Film Council / Arte France Cinéma / Canal+ / Téléfilm Canada Distribution The Business 2 September 2005 Nick Love Monkey Productions S.L. / Powder Films / Pathé Production Pusher II 16 September 2005 Nicolas Winding Refn Billy's People / Nordisk Film[19] Distribution Stoned 18 November 2005 Stephen Woolley Number 9 Films / Finola Dwyer Productions Distribution Pusher 3 9 June 2006 Nicolas Winding Refn Det Danske Filminstitut / Nordisk Film / TV2 Danmark / NWR Film Productions Distribution Dirty Sanchez: The Movie 22 September 2006 Jim Hickey MTV Europe[20] Production London to Brighton 1 December 2006 Paul Andrew Williams Steel Mill Pictures / Wellington Films / LTB Films Limited Distribution Outlaw 9 March 2007 Nick Love Pathé / Ingenious Film Partners Production, Distribution Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten 18 May 2007 Julien Temple Parallel Film Productions / FilmFour / Nitrate Films Distribution Sparkle 17 August 2007 Tom Hunsinger Isle of Man Film / Magic Light Pictures Distribution WΔZ 20 August 2007 Tom Shankland UK Film Council / Ingenious Film Partners[21] Production, Distribution Shotgun Stories 19 October 2007 Jeff Nichols A Lucky Old Sun Production / Muskat Filmed Properties / Upload Films[22] Distribution In the Shadow of the Moon 2 November 2007 David Sington Discovery Films / FilmFour / Passion Pictures Distribution Shrooms 23 November 2007 Paddy Breathnach Capitol Films / Ingenious Film Partners / Nepenthe Film Distribution Outpost 16 May 2008 Steve Barker Black Camel Pictures / Regent Capital Distribution In Search of a Midnight Kiss 13 June 2008 Alex Holdridge Midnight Kiss Productions Distribution The Escapist 20 June 2008 Rupert Wyatt Picture Farm / Parallel Film Productions Distribution Faintheart 20 September 2008 Vito Rocco MySpace / Screen West Midlands / Slingshot Productions Distribution, Production Summer 5 December 2008 Kenneth Glenaan UK Film Council / EM Media Distribution The Children 5 December 2008 Tom Shankland Aramid Entertainment / Barnsnape Films / BBC Films Production Dogging: A Love Story 25 January 2009 Simon Ellis Production Bronson 13 March 2009 Nicolas Winding Refn Aramid Entertainment / Str8jacket Creations / EM Media / Perfume Films Distribution, Production French Film 15 May 2009 Jackie Oudney Slingshot Productions / APT Films / IWC Media / Met Film Production Distribution Doghouse 12 June 2009 Jake West Carnaby International Distribution Chiko 21 August 2009 Özgür Yildirim Corazón International / Norddeutscher Rundfunk Distribution The Firm 18 September 2009 Nick Love Warner Bros.
