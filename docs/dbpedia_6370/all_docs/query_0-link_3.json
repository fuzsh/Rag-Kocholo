        "text": "British film and television production company\n\n\"Working Title\" redirects here. For the concept of a temporary title, see Working title. For the band, see The Working Title.\n\nWorking Title Films Limited[1] is a British film studio that produces motion pictures and television programs and is a subsidiary of Universal Pictures, a division of NBCUniversal, which is itself a division of Comcast. The company was founded by Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe in 1983. Bevan and Eric Fellner are now the co-chairmen of the company.\n\nCompany history\n\n[edit]\n\nBevan and Radclyffe were partners in pop music promotional company, Aldabra, and set up Working Title Films in London in 1983 where they were commissioned by newly created UK broadcaster, Channel 4, to make a television film, My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), directed by Stephen Frears. My Beautiful Launderette was a success at the Edinburgh Film Festival and received a theatrical release, where it was successful internationally. Accountant Graham Bradstreet joined as a third partner in 1986.[2]\n\nA World Apart was entered in competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and won the Special Grand Prize of the Jury. The Tall Guy (1988) saw the feature film debut of screenwriter Richard Curtis and director Mel Smith.[2]\n\nIn 1988, Michael Kuhn of PolyGram started to work with the company and in 1989 PolyGram acquired 49% of the company and they jointly launched Manifesto Film Sales.[3] Manifesto's first third-party pick up for distribution was the Coen brothers' Barton Fink (1991).[4] Bradstreet left the company in 1990 and Radclyffe a year later, with Eric Fellner, a fellow independent film producer, joining the company in 1991.[5][3][2] The same year, Kuhn set up PolyGram Filmed Entertainment which acquired 100% of Working Title in 1992.[3][2] The company produced a variety of films for PolyGram Filmed Entertainment which became a major Hollywood competitor.\n\nPaul Webster set up an office in Los Angeles in 1991 and producer Liza Chasin was appointed as president of production.[6] Webster produced the company's first American films, Rubin & Ed and Drop Dead Fred. Working Title also made Tim Robbins' directorial debut, Bob Roberts (1992).[2]\n\nGramercy Pictures began distributing the company's films in the United States, starting with Posse (1993). In 1994, the company's Four Weddings and a Funeral, written by Curtis, became the highest-grossing British film of all-time with a gross of $245 million.[3][2] They also made the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy (1994). In 1996, Robbins' Dead Man Walking was the company's first film to win an Academy Award, with Susan Sarandon winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. The Coen brothers' Fargo (1996) won two Academy Awards the following year. The company had another major success with Bean (1997) directed by Smith and co-written by Curtis, grossing $251 million.[2]\n\nIn 1998, PolyGram was sold to the Seagram company and merged with MCA Music Entertainment, to form Universal Music Group. PolyGram Films was folded into Universal Pictures. In 1999, Seagram sold the bulk of its library of PolyGram films released up until 31 March 1996 to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[citation needed] 1999 also saw the company's highest-grossing film to date with Notting Hill, again written by Curtis, with a gross of $364 million.\n\nAlthough contractually allowed to produce any film with a budget of up to $35 million, on a practical basis, Bevan and Fellner consult with studio executives at Working Title's parent company NBCUniversal.[7] Working Title company renewed its first look deal with Universal Pictures in 2020.[8]\n\nWT2 Productions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Bevan and Fellner launched a subsidiary company named Working Title 2 Productions, commonly known as WT2. The company is an independent film production arm run by Natascha Wharton, and has produced films that include Billy Elliot, Shaun of the Dead and The Calcium Kid.[5]\n\nTelevision division\n\n[edit]\n\nWorking Title has been active in television production since the beginning of the 1990s.[9] In February 2010, Working Title officially launched its television division as a joint venture with parent company NBCUniversal, itself owned by Comcast.[10] Since then, they have produced content for both British and American television.[11][12] Notable productions and co productions developed by Working Title Television (WTTV)[13] include NBC's About a Boy, and Showtime's The Tudors.[9]\n\nWTTV has offices in London and Los Angeles.[14][15]\n\nTV productions\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Years Co-production Network Notes The Borrowers 1992 BBC Two Tales of the City 1993 Propaganda Films Channel Four The Baldy Man 1995–1998 Central Independent Television ITV Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) 2000–2001 BBC One The Tudors 2007–2010 Reveville Erie\n\nOctagon Entertainment\n\nPeace Arch Entertainment\n\nShowtime Networks BBC Two\n\nCBC Television\n\nShowtime\n\nTV3 Love Bites 2011 Loud Blouse Productions\n\nUniversal Television NBC Yonderland 2013–2016 Sky 1 About a Boy 2014–2015 True Jack Productions\n\nTriBeCa Productions\n\nUniversal Television NBC You, Me and the Apocalypse 2015 BigBalls Films\n\nBritish Sky Broadcasting\n\nNBCUniversal International Studios Sky 1\n\nNBC London Spy NBCUniversal International Studios\n\nBBC America BBC Two Gypsy 2017 Rhythm Arts Entertainment\n\nPen and Paper Industries\n\nUniversal Television Netflix Hanna 2019–2021 Amazon Studios\n\nTomorrow Studios\n\nFocus Features\n\nNBCUniversal International Studios Amazon Prime Video The Case Against Adnan Syed 2019 Instinct Productions\n\nDisarming Films\n\nHBO Documentary Films\n\nNBCUniversal International Studios HBO Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City 2019 Sweatpants Productions\n\nUniversal Television\n\nNBCUniversal International Studios Netflix The Luminaries 2020 Southern Light Films\n\nTVNZ\n\nFremantle\n\nSilver Reel TVNZ\n\nBBC One We Are Lady Parts 2021–present Channel 4 Everything I Know About Love 2022–present BBC One\n\n1991 ITV franchise bid\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1991, Working Title was involved in a bid for the London Weekend ITV licence. Working Title, Mentorn, Palace and PolyGram wanted to take over from London Weekend Television and broadcast to London under the name London Independent Broadcasting. In the event LWT retained its licence; London Independent Broadcasting's proposals were deemed by the Independent Television Commission, which was overseeing the bid process, to fail the quality threshold.[16]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease date Title Notes 15 November 1985 My Beautiful Laundrette with Channel Four Films 24 July 1987 Wish You Were Here with Channel Four Films 30 October 1987 Sammy and Rosie Get Laid with Channel Four Films 17 June 1988 A World Apart 10 September 1988 Paperhouse with Vestron Pictures 13 April 1989 The Tall Guy with London Weekend Television 19 May 1989 For Queen and Country 14 November 1989 Diamond Skulls\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease date Title Notes 22 June 1990 Fools of Fortune with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Channel Four Films 27 July 1990 Chicago Joe and the Showgirl with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and New Line Cinema 13 May 1991 Robin Hood 24 May 1991 Drop Dead Fred with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and New Line Cinema 21 August 1991 Barton Fink with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and 20th Century Fox 18 October 1991 Edward II 13 December 1991 London Kills Me with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Fine Line Features 15 May 1992 Rubin & Ed with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment 17 July 1992 Dakota Road with Channel Four Films, British Screen Productions and Mayfair Entertainment 4 September 1992 Bob Roberts with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Miramax Films and LIVE Entertainment 23 April 1993 Map of the Human Heart with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Miramax Films 14 May 1993 Posse with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 8 October 1993 The Young Americans with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Live Entertainment 4 February 1994 Romeo Is Bleeding with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 9 March 1994 Four Weddings and a Funeral with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Channel Four Films and Gramercy Pictures 11 March 1994 The Hudsucker Proxy with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures 3 May 1995 Panther with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 5 May 1995 French Kiss with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and 20th Century Fox 29 September 1995 Moonlight and Valentino with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 29 December 1995 Dead Man Walking with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 8 March 1996 Fargo with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 22 March 1996 Land and Freedom with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 20 September 1996 Loch Ness with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 7 March 1997 The Eighth Day with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 2 August 1997 Bean with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Tiger Aspect Films and Gramercy Pictures 3 October 1997 The Matchmaker with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 5 December 1997 The Borrowers with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 6 March 1998 The Big Lebowski with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 22 November 1998 Elizabeth with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, StudioCanal, Channel Four Films and Gramercy Pictures 29 January 1999 The Hi-Lo Country with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures 28 May 1999 Notting Hill with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, StudioCanal and Universal Pictures 1 October 1999 Plunkett & Macleane with StudioCanal, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Gramercy Pictures\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease date Title Notes 31 March 2000 High Fidelity with Touchstone Pictures 13 October 2000 Billy Elliot with BBC Films, Tiger Aspect Productions, StudioCanal and Universal Focus 2 December 2000 O Brother, Where Art Thou?
