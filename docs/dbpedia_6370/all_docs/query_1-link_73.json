        "text": "Low budget independent films are facing a tough time financially amid the economic slowdown, the UK Film Council has said.\n\nThe number of feature films funded solely in the UK fell slightly from 77 in 2008 to 71 in 2009.\n\nOverall, budgets for independent films in 2009 also showed a slight drop.\n\nHowever, it was a record year at the UK box office overall last year, with takings of Â£944m and the highest admissions since 2002 (173.5 million).\n\nOne of the main reasons for this growth, the report said, was the emergence of 3D cinema. Avatar, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and Ice Age III were the three most popular films in UK cinemas in 2009.\n\nThe figures came as the Film Council launched its first fully-searchable website with comprehensive statistics.\n\n'Tough transition'\n\n\"Overall it's clear that British cinema has been weathering the global recession well,\" said UK Film Council chief executive John Woodward. He said the sectors of production, distribution and exhibition were \"firing on all cylinders\".\n\nBut he said the marketplace for financing smaller, independently-produced British films was becoming more difficult.\n\nThis was partly as a result of the overall economic slowdown and partly down to \"the increasingly tough transition from the analogue to the digital age\".\n\n\"Low budget independent production is a tough business - it always has been,\" he said, noting that figures for the first half of 2010 showed a continuing pressure on smaller film production."
