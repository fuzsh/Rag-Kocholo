Paul will join the Executive Leadership Team and will lead our AI Product and Development Team, playing a crucial role in delivering the BBFC‚Äôs AI projects. Here's what Paul had to say: ‚ÄúJoining the BBFC is a huge privilege, particularly at this time as we bring our AI products to market in partnership with our peers, content creators and providers around the world. ‚ÄúThis is an exciting time for us as an organisation as we break into the rapidly changing AI space and improve the presence of trusted and locally recognised age ratings, so international audiences can have the best possible viewing experiences.‚Äù Read more on our website: https://lnkd.in/eMSKiq3d\n\nOur new Classification Guidelines are now in effect. So, what does this mean for UK audiences? In the latest episode of the BBFC podcast, hear directly from two members of our Compliance team, Chris Davies and Wallis Seaton, as they discuss what our new Classification Guidelines mean in practice and how these changes will apply to BBFC age ratings moving forward. üéß Listen here: https://lnkd.in/eebcG-Yt\n\nAhead of our new Classification Guidelines coming into effect on Wednesday, our President Natasha Kaplinsky caught up with Jeremy Vine. The pair discussed how 12,000 people contributed to our biggest-ever research project, how our guidelines reflect what people told us and what audiences can expect to see at different age ratings going forward. Plus, find out how many of the 1,114 films we classified last year received an 18 certificate! Listen here, Natasha joins the show at 00:32 üëâ https://lnkd.in/eMzeTn7r\n\nShaped by you. Because that's exactly what we are. 12,000 people - the most ever - told us what they want from the future of film classification. Here's what they told us and what we're going to do ‚§µÔ∏è One. People told us they‚Äôre more concerned about depictions of violence. So, in future, we're more likely to tighten up our approach to violent content across all age ratings Two. On drugs, people are satisfied with our approach, with two exceptions. Audiences have become more relaxed about cannabis and solvent misuse. So we're going to take a less restrictive approach to such content. Three. In relation to sex, people want us to tighten up at the 12/15 border but loosen up when it comes to 15/18, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Four. Parents are concerned about the normalisation of bad language. This means that in future, some bad language that‚Äôs currently PG will move up a category. Find out more on our website www.bbfc.co.uk\n\nWe‚Äôve got some news‚Ä¶ Our new Classification Guidelines are here! This week we launched our latest Classification Guidelines, which will form the foundation of film and content classification for the next five years! To mark the occasion, our President, Natasha Kaplinsky OBE, and Chief Executive, David Austin OBE, hosted a special event at London‚Äôs Picturehouse Central, where we welcomed our friends from the film, television and mobile network industries. We sat down with film critic Mark Kermode to explore what matters most to UK audiences and what our changes mean for them. Film journalist Ellen E Jones met with our fabulous Youth Panel to chat about the issues affecting young people on screen. To find out more, visit https://lnkd.in/ecih3yue"
