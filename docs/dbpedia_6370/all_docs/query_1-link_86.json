The total amount spent on films in the UK last year was Â£956.9m.\n\n\"Taken together, these box office and inward investment numbers show how film in the UK has moved from the margins back to the mainstream, helping sustain jobs and promote the UK's place on the international stage,\" said John Woodward, chief executive officer of the UK Film Council. \"[We are] weathering the recession well.\"\n\nHe added: \"British cinema-goers are voting with their feet - they want to see big event movies, many of which depend on outstanding British talent and are made in the UK thanks to our reliable film tax credit.\""
