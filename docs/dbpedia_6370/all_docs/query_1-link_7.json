It also surpasses the previous year's record of having the most ticket sales in a single year (fueled by the success of various sequels and the first Spider-Man movie).\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nMarch 1 — Paramount Pictures reveals a new-on screen logo that was used until December 2011 to celebrate its 90th anniversary.\n\nMay – The Pianist directed by Roman Polanski wins the \"Palme d'Or\" at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMay 3–5 – Spider-Man becomes the first film to earn $100 million in one weekend. This surpassed the previous all-time opening weekend record held by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as the previous May opening weekend record held by The Lost World: Jurassic Park.[2] The film went on to earn over $800 million worldwide, surpassing Batman to become the highest-grossing superhero film of all time and Men in Black to become Sony's most successful film.[3][4]\n\nMay 16 – Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones opens in theaters. Although a huge success, it was the first Star Wars film not to be the highest-grossing of the year.\n\nAmélie directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet wins the 2002 César Award for Best Film, Best Director, Best Music, and Best Art Direction. Amélie also became the highest-grossing French-language film in the United States ever.\n\nAnother French-language film Brotherhood of the Wolf also became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States in the last two decades.\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nCategory/Organization 8th Critics' Choice Awards\n\nJanuary 17, 2003 60th Golden Globe Awards\n\nJanuary 19, 2003 56th BAFTA Awards\n\nFebruary 23, 2003 Producers, Directors, Screen Actors, and Writers Guild Awards 75th Academy Awards\n\nMarch 23, 2003 Drama Musical or Comedy Best Film Chicago The Hours Chicago The Pianist Chicago Best Director Steven Spielberg\n\nCatch Me If You Can and Minority Report Martin Scorsese\n\nGangs of New York Roman Polanski\n\nThe Pianist Rob Marshall\n\nChicago Roman Polanski\n\nThe Pianist Best Actor Jack Nicholson\n\nAbout Schmidt\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis\n\nGangs of New York Jack Nicholson\n\nAbout Schmidt Richard Gere\n\nChicago Daniel Day-Lewis\n\nGangs of New York Adrien Brody\n\nThe Pianist Best Actress Julianne Moore\n\nFar from Heaven Nicole Kidman\n\nThe Hours Renée Zellweger\n\nChicago Nicole Kidman\n\nThe Hours Renée Zellweger\n\nChicago Nicole Kidman\n\nThe Hours Best Supporting Actor Chris Cooper\n\nAdaptation.
