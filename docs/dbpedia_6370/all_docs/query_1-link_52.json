        "text": "Class: Wednesday 11.45-13.15 online on Zoom\n\nOffice hours: online by appointment\n\nMost students of English Studies are familiar with such acclaimed British films as Four Weddings and A Funeral, The King’s Speech, James Bond or the Harry Potter series. British cinema is thus often associated with costume dramas, iconic historical figures, great literature, stylishness, dead-pan humour and romance. However, there is more to British film than meets the eye and the aim of this course is to familiarise you with lesser-known titles, movements and trends that over the years have shaped British film into its present globally recognised form. We will examine key films spreading across decades from the 1960s to the present. We will discuss close links between British cinema and Hollywood, kitchen-sink, realism, heritage cinema and British screen masculinity (e.g. Michael Caine, Hugh Grant). This will allow us to investigate crucial socio-cultural phenomena such as the cultural revolution in the 1960s, Punk subculture in the 1970s, Thatcherism, Cool Britannia as well as the rise of the underclass. Some titles to consider: Alfie, The Ipcress File, This is England, A Room with a View, The Full Monty, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Fish Tank and others.\n\nAssessment: 50% participation, attendance, regular preparation; 50% final essay c. 1500-2000 words (only two unexcused absences allowed!!)\n\nOnline lesson etiquette\n\nYour cameras have to be on but your mics remain on mute.
