        "text": "It was a funding scheme to support the production of short films. A total of Â£70,000 was awarded on a bi-annual basis to around 14 of the most promising UK short films that had already been shot but lacked the necessary funds to be completed.\n\nWhere have you heard about the UK Film Council Completion Fund?\n\nThe scheme was launched in 2002. The finished films were originally screened on Channel 4 and Film4, but from 2004 they premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in a section called First Past the Post.\n\nWhat you need to know about the UK Film Council Completion Fund.\n\nThe UK Film Council preserved a copy of each film in its national archive in Sheffield, and DVD copies were stored by the Edinburgh International Film Festival.\n\nThe UK Film Council was abolished in 2011 as part of a cost-cutting drive by the Government. Many of its functions passed to the British Film Institute, which now uses National Lottery funds to develop and support UK film talent."
