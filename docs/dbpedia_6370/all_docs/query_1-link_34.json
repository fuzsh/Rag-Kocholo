For larger images please make sure to click 'crop and upload' after uploading your image.\n\nIf we don't receive a still for a COMPLETED film, we can't publish your submission.\n\nIf you don't yet have stills because your feature-length film is in pre-production, production or post production, you can upload credit details without images, and add images later. Please contact us via films@britishcouncil.org later to make these image updates.\n\nEditing your entry\n\nOnce your film is listed in the database, you can suggest changes and updates by mailing us at films@britishcouncil.org.\n\nThe British Council has editorial control over all database entries and may update or remove listings.\n\nIMDB\n\nWe do not publish links to IMDB entries.\n\nProduction & Sales Details\n\nContact information - A name and at least an email must be provided in the Production Company and/or Sales Agent sections (this could be the producer or director's contacts). These details will be published online.\n\nIf you don't provide this information, we can't list your film.\n\nContact details\n\nThe '05 Contact details' section at the bottom of the form is for our internal use only, and these details won't be published online."
