The U.K. Film Council will pump £18 million ($35.5 million) during the next two years into the nine regional agencies that aim to develop the film economy and culture across England.

Each of the agencies will receive £7.7 million ($15 million) per year from the coffers of the Regional Investment Fund for England, the government-backed body said Wednesday. The cash is a mix of National Lottery and grant-in-aid funding.

The Regional Screen Agencies were set up between 2002 and 2004 and have received more than £50 million in lottery and grant-in-aid funding from the U.K. Film Council.

The agencies are EM Media, Film London, Northern Film and Media, Northwest Vision and Media, Screen East, Screen South, Screen West Midlands, Screen Yorkshire and South West Screen.

U.K. Film Council CEO John Woodward said the agencies “bring together all the different parts of the film agenda at a local level, from locations support to film production” and described them as “a catalyst for bringing different and fresh stories to the big screen.”

He cited such titles as “Control” and “This Is England” as the types of films to benefit from the support.
