        "text": "03.06.21\n\nEditorial Note\n\nA new petition by international scholars deserves attention. It states that “In the classroom and on campus, we commit to Pressuring our academic institutions and organizations to respect the Palestinian call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions of Israel by instating measures that remove complicity and partnership with military, academic, and legal institutions involved in entrenching Israel’s policies.”\n\nThe scholars who signed this petition affirm that the Palestinian struggle is an “indigenous liberation movement” that confronts a “settler colonial state” that enacts “policies of apartheid” with a “territorial theft” and “the racial supremacy of Jewish-Zionist nationals.” This petition argues that Israel is once again “conducting a large-scale aerial bombing campaign against the fourteen-year besieged Gaza Strip, killing scores of Palestinians and making thousands more homeless.” Any talks about the Hamas rockets reflect the “thorough dehumanization of Palestinians and the abject disregard for Israeli military aggression.” The scholars promise to “Support community efforts and legislation to pressure our governments to end funding Israeli military aggression.”\n\nThe petition states that, since Palestinian scholars work “under the threat of settler colonial erasure and imposition of exile, it is understood that their ideas and experiences are inextricably bound to the intellectual project and tradition that is Palestinian studies.” However, “research and writing are not enough,” having only “Scholarship without action normalizes the status quo and reinforces Israel’s impunity.” Critical theory must be backed with deeds. Therefore, they “affirm that it is no longer acceptable to conduct research in Palestine or on Palestinians without a clear component of political commitment…It is no longer acceptable to speak over Palestinians, or publish without citation of Palestinian scholars.”\n\nAmong the hundreds of signatories are some renowned leaders of the anti-Israel front. They include Noura Erakat; Richard Falk; Haim Bresheeth-Zabner; Moshe Machover; David Lloyd; David Palumbo-Liu; Mark LeVine; Nick Riemer; Ilana Feldman; Adi M. Ophir; Ariella Aisha Azoulay; Beshara Doumani; Ilan Pappe; Nahla Abdo; Ophira Gamliel; Yael Politi; Noa Shaindlinger.\n\nThe Israeli signatories from Israeli institutions are Noga Wolff, The College of Management Academic Studies; Ilana Hairston, Tel Hai Academic College; Lama Midlej, Tel Aviv University; Nadeem Karkabi, University of Haifa; Maha El-Taji Daghash, University of Haifa.\n\nThe petition was widely circulated. It reached Jadaliyya, a journal published by the Arab Studies Institute, based in Washington DC and Beirut. It is a non-profit organization that “produces knowledge on matters related to the Arab world and its relations.”\n\nIn Ireland, Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union and the Trinity College Dublin BDS campaign group have called their academics to sign this pledge. “A Google Form where staff members can sign the pledge has been sent to all heads of Trinity’s schools,” as reported by the University Times in Ireland. In the US, Newsweek reported that “Hundreds of Princeton Faculty, Students Sign Letter Opposing Israel’s ‘Jewish Supremacy.'”\n\nSurprisingly, however, this petition has even reached the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. Their CHCI-Global Humanities Institute on Migration, Logistics and Unequal Citizens in Contemporary Global Context has published this call on their website. This institute is dealing mainly with the international migrations that changed contemporary 21st-century societies, producing cases of massive displaced and precarious lives that impacted local communities.\n\nOnce again, the pro-Palestinian activists show their profound bias. They refuse to acknowledge that Israel has the right to respond, as per international war conventions, to the barrage of missiles that Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched from Gaza. Equally important, the petition advocates for Palestinian supremacy.\n\nThe Israeli academics who signed the petition raise another issue. Advocating for BDS is illegal in Israel since the Knesset passed the Law for Prevention of Damage to the State of Israel through Boycott, in 2011. Israeli academics are openly involved with BDS without any reaction from the authorities. Like any other breach of law, their action deserves scrutiny.\n\nhttps://www.jadaliyya.com/Details/42753\n\nOpen Letter and Call to Action – Palestine and Praxis: Scholars for Palestinian FreedomBy : Jadaliyya Reports\n\nThis is an open call for action issued by the Palestine and Praxis organization. Sign in solidarity here. As scholars, we affirm the Palestinian struggle as an indigenous liberation movement confronting a settler colonial state. The pitched battle in Sheikh Jarrah is the most recent flashpoint in the ongoing Nakba that is the Palestinian condition. Israel has expanded and entrenched its settler sovereignty through warfare, expulsion, tenuous residency rights, and discriminatory planning policies. The ostensible peace process has perpetuated its land grabs and violent displacement under the fictions of temporality and military necessity. Together these policies constitute apartheid, bolstered by a brute force that enshrines territorial theft and the racial supremacy of Jewish-Zionist nationals. And now, as has been the case for over a century, Palestinians continue to resist their removal and erasure.\n\nPalestinian resistance to this eliminatory violence in Sheikh Jarrah and the raids on Al-Aqsa Mosque have catalyzed protests across a violently separated landscape. Palestinians in Lydd, Nazareth, Acre, Haifa and elsewhere have raised Palestinian flags in mass protest affirming the national and singular character of the Palestinian people and their collective call for liberation. Israel is once again conducting a large-scale aerial bombing campaign against the fourteen-year besieged Gaza Strip, killing scores of Palestinians and making thousands more homeless.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, Palestinian death is treated as a byproduct of Israeli vulnerability. The attempts to transform the conversation on Israeli state violence to a series of stale talking points about Hamas rockets reflect the thorough dehumanization of Palestinians and the abject disregard for Israeli military aggression. For decades, Palestinians have been subjects of academic research that scholars use to understand the functions of settler colonial state power. Yet in moments of crisis, we are humbly reminded that research and writing are not enough.\n\nAs Palestinian scholars write under the threat of settler colonial erasure and imposition of exile, it is understood that their ideas and experiences are inextricably bound to the intellectual project and tradition that is Palestinian studies. Living within a political context that challenges their very existence, it is imperative that we not enact their replacement and erasure within our own scholarship, as Palestinians are barred from the academy. Approaching Palestine as a field of knowledge, rather than a case study or site of theoretical extraction, demands engaging with the intellectual labor of its people as a genealogy of subjugated knowledge in praxis. Resisting their erasure from the historical record requires a citational practice that both names Palestinians as intellectual subjects and challenges the very intellectual discourse that relegates them to the margins.\n\nWe recognize our role and responsibility as scholars to theorize, read, and write on the very issues unfolding in Palestine and among all oppressed nations today. Scholarship without action normalizes the status quo and reinforces Israel’s impunity.\n\nScholarship must also be ethical by centering decolonization and raising the voices of Palestinian scholars, as well as other interlocutors, so that they remain sources of authority and not merely objects of study. We believe that the critical theory we generate in our literature and in our classrooms must be backed in deed. Therefore, we affirm that it is no longer acceptable to conduct research in Palestine or on Palestinians without a clear component of political commitment. It is no longer acceptable to study one fragment of Palestine, and claim knowledge of the whole. It is no longer acceptable to speak over Palestinians, or publish without citation of Palestinians scholars. Simply put, it is no longer acceptable to treat Palestine as a playground for intellectual curiosity while its fragmented nation continues to struggle for liberation.\n\nTherefore, we affirm our commitment to the following actions, and we call on our colleagues to join us in our affirmation of the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people and foundational principles of academic integrity.\n\nIn the classroom and on campus, we commit to\n\nPressuring our academic institutions and organizations to respect the Palestinian call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions of Israel by instating measures that remove complicity and partnership with military, academic, and legal institutions involved in entrenching Israel’s policies.\n\nSupporting student activism on campus, including, but not limited to sponsoring joint events and holding our universities’ accountable for violations of academic freedom.\n\nHighlighting Palestinian scholarship on Palestine in syllabi, our writing, and through invitation of Palestinian scholars and community members to speak at departmental and university events.\n\nExtending the above approach to any and all indigenous scholars within the university, and any Indigenous communities within the vicinity.\n\nCentering Indigenous analyses in teaching and drawing links to intersectional oppression and transnational liberation movements.\n\nIn our research, we will actively\n\nInclude Palestine as a space and place worthy of substantive and historical integration into critical theory, not only as a case in a list of colonial examples.\n\nWork to engage methods which highlight and elevate the voices and experiences of the places and moments we study over our own positions.\n\nIn places where we reside, we will\n\nSupport community efforts and legislation to pressure our governments to end funding Israeli military aggression.\n\n===============================================\n\nNational Chiao Tung University, Taiwan\n\nhttps://ghi2020.web.nctu.edu.tw/palestine-praxis-open-call-and-letter-to-action/\n\nCHCI-GLOBAL HUMANITIES INSTITUTE 2020-2021\n\nMigration, Logistics and Unequal Citizens in Contemporary Global Context\n\nPALESTINE & PRAXIS – Open Call and Letter to Action\n\n2021 年 5 月 24 日 by 0589709 0589709zz1\n\n==============================================\n\nhttps://palestineandpraxis.weebly.com/\n\nOpen Letter and Call to Action\n\nPalestine and Praxis: Open Letter and Call to Action\n\nPALESTINE & PRAXIS\n\nSCHOLARS FOR PALESTINIAN FREEDOM\n\nAs scholars, we affirm the Palestinian struggle as an indigenous liberation movement confronting a settler colonial state.
