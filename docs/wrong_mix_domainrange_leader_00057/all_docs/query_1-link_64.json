        "text": "'Adis Duderija has comprehensively captured some of the most recent debates in modern Islamic thought on how foundational religious texts are interpreted. In doing so, he has not only rendered a major service to scholarship but he has also distilled the kinds of life-worlds a variety of contemporary Muslim interpreters foster. He is to be commended for this work that will no doubt spark robust debate.' - Ebrahim Moosa, Professor of Religion & Islamic Studies, Department of Religion, Duke University\n\n'At best, conceptions of the 'ideal' Muslim woman can be inspirational and, at worst, ideological straight-jackets for both real women and for understanding Islam.Adis Duderija does a fine job of exploring the tensions within and between different ideal types and their implications for Muslim women and, let's face it, for men as well.' - Asma Barlas, Professor and Director, Center for the Study of Culture, Race, and Ethnicity, Ithaca College\n\n'This new study by the gifted young scholar, Adis Duderija, substantially raises the bar for all future studies dealing with the issues of fundamentalism, traditionalism, reformism, and authenticity and progress in Muslim thought.' - Khaled Abou El Fadl, Omar and Azmeralda Alfi Professor of Law, Chair of Islamic Studies Program, UCLA School of Law"
