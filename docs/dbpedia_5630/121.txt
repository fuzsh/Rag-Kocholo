“Supersonic” by J. J. Fad

J. J. Fad is an American rap group from Los Angeles, California, whose name initially stood for Just, Jammin’, Fresh And Def. They got a recording contract with the help of Eazy-E. Their first album, Supersonic, was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella (shortly before they became famous with the group N.W.A), and went platinum. The single was a huge success, also going platinum, and peaking at #30 on the Billboard charts on June 18, 1988. J. J. Fad were the first female rap group to earn a Grammy nomination and have a record reach platinum status.

It took 3 years for J. J. Fad to follow up with their next album, 1991’s Not Just a Fad. But the album failed to make an impact. The group disbanded shortly afterwards.
