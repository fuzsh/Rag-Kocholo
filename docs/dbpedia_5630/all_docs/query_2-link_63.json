        "text": "NWA\n\nAlong with Dre, Yella produced Eazy-E’s debut album Eazy-Duz-It\n\nand all three N.W.A albums including one by rapper Dizzee Dac,\n\ntranslating into millions of sales. He co-produced along with Arabian\n\nPrince the platinum-selling debut albums of J.J. Fad and Michel’le with Dre and contributed to The D.O.C.‘s 1989 album No One Can Do It Better (also produced by Dre). Jerry Heller\n\nwitnessed Dre and Yella’s work together and wrote in 2006 of an almost\n\neerie understanding between the pair, as they crafted high quality beats\n\nand productions with almost no words or full sentences needing to be\n\nspoken.\n\nYella remained close to Eazy and stayed on production duties at Ruthless Records after the acrimonious breakup of N.W.A. He produced J.J. Fad‘s second album Not Just a Fad (1990), Yomo & Maulkie‘s album Are U Xperienced? (1991), two tracks from Eazy-E’s It’s On (\n\nDr. Dre\n\n) 187um Killa (1993), the gold-selling hit single Foe tha Love of $ from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony‘s Creepin on ah Come Up E.P., Menajahtwa‘s album Cha-licious, and tracks from H.W.A.‘s Az Much Ass Azz U Want\n\nE.P. (all three from 1994), and oversaw Eazy’s final album in 1995\n\nafter his sudden AIDS-related death. Yella released his 1996 debut solo\n\nalbum One Mo Nigga ta Go on Street Life Records, featuring members of the Ruthless ‘family tree’ like Kokane, B.G. Knocc Out, & Dresta, rhyming over his productions.\n\nAfter this record he retired from music to embark on a long and\n\nsuccessful 12-year career directing and producing porn films. Yella has\n\ncredited himself with producing over 300 sex adult films.[5]"
