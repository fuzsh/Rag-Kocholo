Fad from their debut album of the same name.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first recording of \"Supersonic\" was released in 1987 by the original line-up of J.J. Fad as the B-side to \"Anotha Ho\" on Dream Team Records. The new line-up re-recorded and released \"Supersonic\" in April 1988 as a single; this version reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play Songs and number 22 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. \"Supersonic\" stayed on the dance charts for eight weeks. The single was certified gold by RIAA,[1] and also got nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989, making them the first all-female rap group to be nominated for a Grammy award.[2]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1988) Peak\n\nposition Canada Dance/Urban (RPM)[3] 1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100[4] 30 U.S. Billboard Hot Black Singles[5] 22 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play[6] 10\n\nYear-end charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1988) Position Canada Dance/Urban (RPM)[7] 9\n\nSamples and references in other songs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song has been sampled and referenced by others in the music industry:\n\nFergie in her song \"Fergalicious\", including parts of the beat and ways in which the song is sung.[8] There has been much debate over whether or not this has been legal sampling, and a lawsuit was filed by former N.W.A. member Arabian Prince against Ruthless Records because he says the Black Eyed Peas did not provide them any royalties on the song. In a later interview with HipHopDX, Arabian Prince stated, “will.i.am did the right thing and the good thing by actually saying, ‘Okay, yeah, I got this from “Supersonic,” we’re gonna go ahead and get the publishing on this and pay royalties to me, whoever else and the girls.’ So that was a good thing.”[9]\n\nIn 2004, MF Doom sampled the beatboxing intro from the 1988 video for \"Supersonic\" in his song \"Hoe Cakes\" from his album Mm.. Food.\n\nIn 2006, Teriyaki Boyz referenced J.J. Fad and \"Supersonic\" in their single Tokyo Drift (Fast & Furious).\n\nIn 2009, Beastie Boys reference J.J.
