        "text": "With the official 50th anniversary of hip-hop on Aug. 11, the music industry worldwide is vaunting this quintessential American artform.\n\nIn honor of hip-hop's golden anniversary, a global community has given the culture's leading lights their flowers, unpacked its regional sounds, and debated its most important releases.\n\nThroughout, the genre's fans have marveled how it blossomed throughout the ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s and into present day, permeating absolutely everything.\n\n“It has become a lifestyle. It has simply become part of the air,” Andrew Barber, a hip-hop writer who founded the blog Fake Shore Drive, tells GRAMMY.com. “From sneakers to fashion to slang — even how records outside of the genre are promoted and created draw from hip-hop.\n\n“It's such a force of nature,” Barber continues, “I'm not sure people even realize it's everywhere we look now.”\n\nBut as far as it’s come, it might be just getting started. After all, it’s unfathomable how far hip-hop’s come since the days of “Rapper’s Delight”; where it could propagate and flourish into the next half-century is anyone’s guess.\n\nObviously, nobody can predict exactly how this will happen. But by examining the first 50 years of hip-hop, one can ascertain a few clues as to where this cultural juggernaut is headed.\n\nRead on for a roundtable discussion with creators, movers and shakers in the music industry, who offer insight as to how hip-hop will continue to resonate decades from now.\n\nKathy Iandoli\n\n*Photo: Krista Schlueter*\n\nHip-hop journalist, author of 2022’s God Save the Queens: The Essential History of Women in Hip-Hop\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nI would say that as the tax bracket of hip-hop has changed, so has everything else. From the subject matter to notoriety, to fashion, to even geotags where it's thriving — everything has shifted in waves.\n\nIn many ways, it's definitely progressed and improved — especially as it pertains to the prominence of women. Considering hip-hop has always remained on the pulse of nearly everything, it's also always ahead of the trends. We witness that in real time when it comes to platforms like TikTok, and even the adoption of AI.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nI would give the most credit to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for expanding the parameters of what is categorically considered hip-hop — since half of the album is sung, which has lent itself to the ever-evolving trend of rappers also singing.\n\nI would even throw the Fugees' The Score in there, as an album that showed just how far hip-hop can go when truly allowed to swim in the mainstream.\n\nWhat are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nI think we will see this continuation of experimentation with other genres, while at the same time witnessing artists return to the purity of the art form.\n\nThe younger generations of hip-hop artists are now finally learning about the legends and the music they created, so there will be a group of artists who will want to tinker with that sound, similar to when rock musicians of the early 2000s adopted a '70s vintage/punk rock sound. Everything happens in cycles.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nThe essential component for any long-term growth is acknowledging the power of hip-hop and its impact on a global level. If at any point that needs to be re-stated, then the message was already lost in translation and won't contribute to the growth of the genre as a whole.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop? And why? In other words, who is writing and creating the future of hip-hop today?\n\nCoi Leray, hands down. Not only does Coi acknowledge, respect, and collaborate with the legends; she constantly innovates, while working not only on the music, but also the fashion and visuals. She embodies her moniker of Trendsetter. I hope other artists of her generation do the same.\n\nKid Kenn\n\n*Photo: Rueguh*\n\nChicago-based rapper\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years?\n\nHip-hop has come a long way in the past 50 years! It's a whole new game. It's not just the guys spitting bars anymore. We got badass female artists and gay artists representing. There’s more variety in the industry than ever!\n\nWhat has changed, progressed or improved?\n\nYou can create your own lane. We got the internet and social media. Anybody with a dream and a mic can blow up! It's opened doors for all kinds of talent.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider essential to the genre's evolution?\n\nI have to give props to The Pinkprint; that’s prime Nicki Minaj. And \"Busy Being Bad,\" my upcoming project — it’s coming out soon and I’m excited!\n\nCan you predictwhere hip-hop's gonna be in the next 50 years?\n\nHip-hop will become even more free. Artists will be able to express themselves in ways nobody has thought of, and it will be exciting.\n\nWhat will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nSounds, styles and visuals that'll blow your mind. Artists like me will be pushing the envelope. There won’t be any holding back and we'll be rocking to beats we ain't even imagined yet.\n\nWhat's needed for hip-hop to keep growing internationally and staying lit for years to come?\n\nIt's all about staying true to who we are. You have to be authentic. We gotta keep telling our stories and collaborating. Hip-hop is going to keep blazing trails worldwide.\n\nWho's leading the charge into hip-hop's next 50 years in your book?\n\nI'm ready to tear it up and redefine the industry. There's a whole new wave of artists who are pushing boundaries. We're the ones who are going to keep hip-hop fresh and unforgettable.\n\nPeter $un\n\n*Photo courtesy of the artist*\n\nL.A.-based rapper\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nThe styles, melodies and cadences have changed for sure. There’s different rhythms and rhyme schemes always, and it’s exciting. The beats have improved and there’s a lot of innovation in the way things are sampled/flipped. There are artists like Knxwledge and Terrace Martin who are innovators progressing the genre, and so many others.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nThere’s a lot [laughs]. Of course, Nas’ Illmatic, everything by Jay-Z basically, DMX’s Hell Is Hot, Goodie Mob’s Soul Food, Outkast’s whole discography, Lil Wayne’s The Dedication, “Run,” and Tha Carter, and more recently, Drake.\n\nThen, you’ve got DJ Harrison’s Tales From The Old Dominion, JID’s The Never Story, Kendrick Lamar’s Damn., and J Cole… Like I said, there are a lot!\n\nWhat are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nI believe hip-hop is always evolving, but there’s a lot of golden-era rap that seems like it will forever be here. People will always love a fire sample with some hard bars over it.\n\nBut I feel like there’s a space opening in alternative rap with songs genre-blending, so I think in 50 years it will be a mix of those two areas.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nSupport and good music. Good music is always undeniable regardless, and can stand the test of time. I believe we also need the artists, DJs, etc. in the genre to usher in the new acts and put on artists that have something to say.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop?\n\nHonestly, besides me, Tyler, the Creator has always pushed it. Liv.e, Knxwledge, Pink Siifu, Jordan Ward, Young Nudy, Larry June, Smino, Flo Milli, Gwen Bunn, and Kamaiyah are just a few others, and more.\n\nI think there’s a lot of innovation in the genre and things will become more blended between R&B and rap. But samples will forever be the core of hip-hop and I think diggers will dig harder and there’s always going to be a space for that for sure.\n\nAndrew Barber\n\n*Photo: David Cabrera*\n\nHip-hop writer, founder of Chicago hip-hop blog Fake Shore Drive\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nIt has become a lifestyle. It has simply become part of the air. From sneakers to fashion to slang — even how records outside of the genre are promoted and created draw from hip-hop. It's such a force of nature, I'm not sure people even realize it's everywhere we look now.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nHip-hop is so vast and music taste is subjective so this is a tough one to answer. It's kind of a choose-your-own-adventure situation. Different ages and different regions will have different answers.\n\nBut one thing I can say for sure: Album or single sales aren't the end-all, be-all. Sales never tell the full story.\n\nMF DOOM never really charted or sold much while he was alive — especially when he was at this output peak in the mid-2000s. But now many of his songs have hundreds of millions of streams.\n\nSometimes it takes years for artists to get the respect and accolades they deserve, while albums that were multi-platinum upon release are now forgotten punchlines.\n\nWhat are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nSongs will get shorter and the lines between genres will continue to blur. Also, smaller regional markets who aren't traditionally known for breaking hip-hop talent will continue to grow and become a force — which is something I'm most excited about.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nInnovation! Not being scared to take risks with your art. Standing out instead of fitting in. Stop chasing the algorithm.\n\nSowmya Krishnamurthy\n\n*Photo: David Noles*\n\nMusic journalist, author, pop culture expert\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nHip-hop has gone from outsider to insider, from the streets of New York City to the dominant culture around the world. What began as underground — what some deemed as ephemeral, noise, a fad — is now the biggest genre. Hip-hop has grown to be a commercial juggernaut and the harbinger of all things cool.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nI’m a firm believer that if you can’t recite the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Juicy,” you’re not really a hip-hop fan.\n\nWhat are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nHip-hop will definitely be on Mars! In all seriousness, I see the sound becoming more diversified with hyperlocal scenes and niche artists. Personally, I’d love to see a return to valuing lyricism and venerating artists that can actually rap over data and the cult of personality.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nHip-hop resonates around the world because of its universal DNA of rebellion and youthful energy. You don’t need to speak a singular language to understand it. Industry gatekeepers should embrace international artists and global sounds. I’d love to see more collaborations across borders and seeing hip-hop as a form of diplomacy.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop? And why? In other words, who is writing and creating the future of hip-hop today?\n\nThe playing field is wide open. Female rappers like Cardi B, Ice Spice and GloRilla are at the forefront of what’s new and what’s trending. There’s a resurgence of nostalgia and old school artists such as Jadakiss and Noreaga are enjoying a second act.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Pharrell Williams has hip-hop on the Louis Vuitton runway in Paris. Anything is possible.\n\nBryan Michael-Cox\n\n*Photo: Kobe Boateng*\n\nProducer, songwriter\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nThe evolution of hip-hop has been the most incredibly advanced of any genre. Think about it, DJ Kool Herc threw a back-to-school jam back in 1973. And that spawned an economy for young creatives to make a proper living. A lot of us are wealthy because of it. That in itself is amazing!\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nThe list is kind of long, so bear with me:\n\nSugar Hill Gang, “Rapper’s Delight”\n\nKurtis Blow, “The Breaks”\n\nGrandmaster Flash and the Furious 5, “The Message”\n\nLL Cool J, “I’m Bad”\n\nRun-D.M.C., Raising Hell\n\nThe Beastie Boys, License To Ill\n\nBig Daddy Kane, Long Live The Kane\n\nBiz Markie, Goin’ Off\n\nToo Short, Born to Mack\n\nPublic Enemy, It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back and Fear of a Black Planet\n\nX Clan, To The East, Backwards\n\nN.W.A., Straight Outta Compton\n\nM.C.

What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nFifty years ago, when hip-hop originated, we had no idea it would sound like this today. My guess is the genre will continue on the trajectory of world domination and the additional genres will blend, with hip-hop being the foundation.\n\nHip-hop has transcended all of our hopes and dreams — out of the public housing communities of New York City to all over the world.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nI think we already have what is needed. It is embedded in youth culture, and it’s just going to continue to get passed down. Hip-Hop is literally everywhere and in everything.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop? And why? In other words, who is writing and creating the future of hip-hop today?\n\nPeople like Tay Keith, Metro Boomin’, ATL Jacob, Nineteen85, Wheezy, and Southside are leading the way when it comes to the genre. And of course, the legends are still holdin’ it down with them. There are so many more, but these are the first names that come to mind.\n\nAtmosphere\n\n*Photo: Dan Monick*\n\nMinneapolis hip-hop duo\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nAs a form of culture and music that has given voice to communities that have historically been unheard, it continues to grow and speak for, about and towards more and more people.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nJungle Brothers, Done by the Forces Of Nature.\n\nWhat are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nObviously it’s impossible to answer this. But I do predict that this will continue to be an artwork that manages to engage in commerce with the right hand while still challenging the status quo with the left hand.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nIn my opinion, it only needs to remain genuine in its messaging.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop? And why? In other words, who is writing and creating the future of hip-hop today?\n\nI avoid questions like this because of potential gatekeeping. This music is at its best when it’s made by the youth challenging the old guard, and I’m slowly naturally becoming a part of the old guard.\n\nI think the best response I can give is to advise people to explore and listen to things that they’ve never heard before. Take a risk, and listen to something that expresses ideas that you don’t already agree with.\n\nCarl Chery\n\n*KenTheMan. Photo: Marcus Ambrose Williams*\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nI feel like everything has changed about it, it changes year to year, which is the beautiful thing about hip-hop. I wouldn’t say it has improved because it’s always been great in its own way over time. I also love seeing the younger generation getting involved in the genre earlier year after year.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nNicki Minaj — any of her early albums, because she brought a certain rap style that was fun and wild. The Migos, because they changed the sound in general. Drake because he brought the diversity in music — one artist doing multiple styles and sounds.\n\nHip-hop celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. What are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nI don’t believe hip-hop is a genre you can predict, because it’s already gone unpredictable places. And that’s the beauty of hip-hop.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nBy staying true to the roots and the core of what it’s always been. We are already 50 years in; it’s never going anywhere. Like you said, hip-hop has already established itself as a dominant cultural force. I couldn’t see if going backward — only forward to another 50 years.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop? And why? In other words, who is writing and creating the future of hip-hop today?\n\nEveryone currently is a part of these next 50 years, if the aliens don’t take over first.\n\n*Photo: Rebecca Sapp/Getty Images for The Recording Academy*\n\nHead of Urban Music at Spotify\n\nHow would you describe the evolution of hip-hop over the past 50 years? What has changed/progressed/improved?\n\nIt's been innovative every step of the way — from the music itself to the way hip-hop executives have approached business.\n\nWhich hip-hop albums or songs of the past 50 years do you consider to be essential to the overall evolution of the genre?\n\nThere's too many albums to list. I immediately think of Nas' Illmatic and how it's changed the way artists approach production. Prior to Illmatic, albums were produced by one producer in their entirety.\n\nI think of Jay-Z's The Blueprint and how it's helped usher in the soul sample sound. I think of OutKast's entire discography. They put Atlanta on the map years before it became hip-hop's new mecca.\n\nOutKast is the only group to sell more albums with each of their studio albums. Kast also expanded on the idea of what hip-hop is supposed to sound like on Stankonia and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\n\nRakim introduced a new, conversational way of flowing on Eric B & Rakim's Paid In Full. Rappers used more of a shouting technique in the early days. Can't forget N.W.A's Straight Out of Compton.\n\nGangsta rap is one of the most commercially successful subgenres in hip-hop history so, of course, I think of Dr. Dre's The Chronic and Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. There's simply too many albums to list.\n\nWhat are your predictions as to where hip-hop will go in the next 50 years? What will hip-hop sound like and look like 50 years from today?\n\nI jokingly call Playboi Carti onomatopoeia rap. I know he's saying actual words but his delivery occasionally makes it sound like he's making sound effects.\n\nI think we're going to see that approach continue to grow. I think we're in the midst of one of the most disruptive times in hip-hop history, so it's harder than usual to forecast where the genre is heading.\n\nHip-hop has established itself as a dominant cultural force around the world. What is needed for the genre to maintain its international growth, development and longevity?\n\nAt the risk of sounding cliche, music is the key to a continued growth globally. It's no coincidence that we're seeing UK rappers rise in popularity in the U.S. They're currently making some of the most interesting music.\n\nAmerican rappers are still the genre's biggest ambassadors so I think it's important for them to cover more ground. Certain markets are harder to penetrate. They require artists to spend time in those markets. We saw Drake go to Brazil for the first time in recent years.\n\nThat was a strategic move to keep building his audience in that part of the world. Japan is a market American artists still need to crack and it's largely hip-hop influenced. We need more rappers on the ground there.\n\nIn your view, which artists, producers, songwriters, and/or creators are today leading the charge into the next 50 years of hip-hop? And why? In other words, who is writing and creating the future of hip-hop today?\n\nThe female rap movement has seen incredible growth in the past four years and it's just scratching the surface. There's a new crop of women being inspired as we speak. Imagine what the movement is going to look and feel like in the next five years and beyond.\n\nI think Latto is positioning herself to become a leader of the pack. She's currently building the foundation to a long-lasting career. I'm excited to see where Doechii goes. She's an artist who has the potential to help us reimagine what hip-hop is supposed to sound like.\n\nBaby Keem is also in a great position. He's steadily building, similar to Latto, and his team is intentional. He's poised to become one of the artists who helps us set the tone into the future.\n\n50 Artists Who Changed Rap: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem & More\n\nWhen The Fugees released their second album, The Score, the timing felt eerily perfect. As hip-hop's East and West Coasts continued their tussle, their lighter-hearted approach to socially conscious rap curtailed any overarching assumptions that hip-hop was going down a \"bad road.\" Plus, they had Lauryn Hill, who doubled as a songbird and lyrical spitfire. Together, by juxtaposing life instrumentation, soulful melodies and abstract bars, The Fugees gave hip-hop a renewed spirit and propelled it to a different kind of mainstream.\n\nBut above all, The Score changed the way artists made their music—even 25 years later.\n\nBy the time The Fugees released The Score, was nominated for Album Of The Year and won Best Rap Album and Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal for \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" they were more than ready to puff out their chests. The group checked the temperature of the streets with their debut album Blunted On Reality in 1994, almost two years prior to the day of The Score's release on February 13, 1996.\n\nStill, their introduction left listeners a little confused by the group's collective identity. Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel were a lot of everything. They were eccentric Jersey kids—two-thirds of whom were Haitian—and were more than willing to fling art, politics, multi-culture and lyricism against a wall and record the sounds of what stuck and what slid off.\n\nThe centerpiece of Blunted was the second single \"Nappy Heads,\" a deeply rhythmic and melodic track with a video that takes place on the steps of the library at Columbia University, where Lauryn Hill was a student at the time. Hill was already the de-facto star of the group, complete with a lead role in the Whoopi Goldberg film Sister Act 2: Back In the Habit. On that debut album, she had a solo track called \"Some Seek Stardom,\" which many point to as the moment they knew she would one day stand out from her comrades. Still, the group was full of promise and their evolution was quick and steadfast.\n\nWith The Score, The Fugees were arguably more focused. They were no longer working with Khalis Bayyan of Kool & The Gang (who theoretically influenced so much of Blunted's sound). This time, Lauryn and Wyclef took the bulk of the writing and production duties with the help of Wyclef's cousin Jerry Wonda and Salaam Remi as a creative consultant. They experimented with creating their own take on R&B-skewed hip-hop tracks and even reggae while adding a live element since Wyclef was a trained musician.\n\nThen, there was Lauryn Hill's phenomenally authentic singing voice, which lent itself to some of the more prominent hooks on the project. The Score was still an amalgam of everything the group stood for, but where Blunted chose to go more animated in parts, The Score opted to get deeper and darker in both sound and style.\n\n\"Red Intro\" sets a unique tone as the opener. The track is a monologue that challenges rappers' desires to posture themselves as gangsters and pretend to be mobsters when people are dying out in the streets. It's an unequivocal backhand to nearly everything that was happening in hip-hop at the time.\n\nThere was a rise in neo-gangster rap, where artists like Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were poetically flaunting wealth and gun talk, woven expertly through their bars. They were the byproduct of '80s artists like N.W.A., and while that surge in gangster rap was tempered by hip-hop's D.A.I.S.Y. Age (A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, etc.), the '90s now had groups like The Fugees and The Roots, who stood in stark contrast to Pac and Biggie.\n\nBut there was more to the mission of The Score, considering the group didn't want to be relegated to one corner of hip-hop. So they dropped breadcrumbs throughout the album to show they knew how to stunt, they were aware of the on-goings of the world, yet they could even be strapped… if they wanted to be. The Score is laden with innuendos, firing shots at the competition while simultaneously making biblical references about false prophets. The songs tell a story from beginning to end, with peaks and valleys.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//ki7gxLbhXkU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThe album's introductory track \"How Many Mics\" gets the chest-thumping started early, as the group details their creative superiority over so many other emcees. The concept of The Score was layered; The Fugees felt slighted by the lukewarm response of their first album and this was pure redemption. They use the title track to tie that all together by the middle of the project, by even sampling parts of the rest of the album on the song's hook.\n\n\"Ready Or Not\" takes an Enya sample and transforms it into a battle cry that doubles as a love song. Tracks like \"Zealots\" take jabs at biting emcees who dumb their work down for mainstream attention, where \"The Mask\" goes in on manufactured personas. \"The Beast\" is a politically charged anthem that tackles political corruption and police brutality, further extended on the track \"Family Business,\" about how being Black and in America can have you murdered for no reason.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//aIXyKmElvv8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\"Fu-Gee-La\" takes on more braggadocio, along with \"Cowboys\" which features another New Jersey rap outfit: The Outsidaz, starring a young Rah Digga. \"No Woman, No Cry\" mourns those who have passed due to violence. The \"Manifest/Outro\" has Lauryn contemplating suicide over a toxic breakup.\n\nThen, of course, there's \"Killing Me Softly,\" the Roberta Flack remake that shifted gears for The Fugees and made them a household name. Thanks to \"Killing Me Softly,\" more attention was paid to the project as a whole, so the casual rap listener suddenly became a hip-hop fan once they experienced The Score. That was The Fugees' superpower: they won over massive audiences with messaging that hip-hop was struggling to convey on a greater platform. Some saw it as a curse to the purity of the art, but in the events that followed it became a gift.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//oKOtzIo-uYw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nWhat happened following The Score's release was complicated. Tupac Shakur was murdered in September 1996, The Notorious B.I.G. was murdered in March 1997, and Puffy's \"Shiny Suit Era\" threatened the purism of hip-hop even more. This gave The Fugees an open lane to not only secure that mainstream success, but retain some of the integrity of hip-hop's soul that they were ironically accused of snatching prior to those milestone events in hip-hop's history.\n\nThe spoiler alert here was that they were always being their true selves the whole time. The Fugees were eccentric, they were artsy, and they were messengers—of the lives they lived and of those they witnessed around them. They weren't afraid to toss around hard bars on The Score nor were they too scared to let Lauryn's voice softly coat the hooks. They spoke about anything and everything they damn well pleased.\n\nIn the decades that followed, rappers who could carry a tune emulated exactly what Lauryn and the Fugees did by alternating between rapping and singing, and weren't afraid in one song to talk about love and society in the next. It was a lasting impression that became one of hip-hop's many archetypes, and it started with a couple of kids who loved being eccentric.\n\nWhen they first approached creating The Score, The Fugees were hoping to win the battle. Twenty-five years later, we see now that they won the war.\n\n'The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill': For The Record"
