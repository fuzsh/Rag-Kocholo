        "text": "I’m just a listener. Not a producer, artist or anything in that spectrum. I’m here to keep you all updated on the current culture in our music world, since that has been a huge part of my daily routine. I came into the hip hop genre very recently when I came to the U.S. I was overwhelm with messages in lyrics about killing, gang and violence but never really paid much attention to them. I grew up with Eminem and his ludicrous words, the image of Drake surrounded by women and Lil Wayne showering in champagne. I wanted this lifestyle, this kind of money and fame until I realized what they are really talking about later down the road. Through my re\n\nsearch, I realized that there are something wrong within hip hop. The lyrics and images that the industry are producing are degrading for a huge population within the audience across the world. These blogs purpose is to give the female population a perspective from a male hip hop fan, that has been advocating for these rappers for years, but are concern for the future of this industry.\n\nWomen has been with hip-hop since the very beginning. Since the days of rap and funk with groups like Salt-n-Pepa, then J.J Fad in the 90’s and today with Beyonce, Rhianna or Nicki Minaj. J.J Fad is actually the first female group to ever win a Grammy. It is difficult to understand how women, the other force that helped shaped hip-hop to what it is today could be t reated in such manner with male rappers. They are also not being recognized for their role in the rap culture. For example, the biography of the group NWA was made into a movie that was released this recent year with very high ratings and box office going through the roof. Although it was recognized as a thorough depiction of the history of the female impact on their road to success. The movie did not mention any kind of incidents that involves women like Dr. Dre assault of the female reporter Dee Barnes and rapper Tairrie B at the Grammy. Another incident in misrepresentation of a female role in hip hop could be like Lil Kim’s role in the movie Notorious BIG’s biography. She was depicted as just a sexual object that only appeared in a seductive scene with Notorious himself. When the director was ask about this, he replied with “Kim will eventually get her own movie”. This misrepresentation of the female’s image carried on till this day in music, lyrics, and music videos of today’s hip hop.\n\nIt is very popular to include misogyny within your lyric of a rap song. From Tupac and Biggie to Drake and Kanye West, not much have changed in the way women are talked about in hip hop lyrics. There are two main themes that scholars have noticed over time in rap lyrics, the first one is aim to degrade women in general, usually placing them in certain stereotypes and reminding them to stay “in their place”. These stereotypes usually include staying at home wife, always needing help from a man or waiting for their rescue in a situation. These messages could be hidden in songs that could be deemed as love or romantic songs, talking about relationship and affection but could be viewed as misogyny by other viewers. It place women with an image of a weak link, an item for men to decide for, etc. Example of this message in lyrics would be like the song “Bitches Ain’t Shit” by Dr. Dre, saying that the only job women really has is to pleasure men and their fantasies. (Weitzer and Kubrin) The second main theme is violence, which the message of these lyrics are violence is the only way to punish a women when they don’t meet the e xpectation of men or when they make a mistake or doesn’t want to listen. This possibly could be the most dangerous type of lyrics which it promotes domestic abuse, assault and borderline murder aiming towards women. So far, the variety of misogyny in hip hop has many different angles to it, but it has been decades since this kind of representation of hip hop started about women, why hasn’t it been stopped? The facts are pointing out that major female artists aren’t really helping with the cause but are putting even more fuel into the fire.\n\nWhy is the music artist Beyonce being deemed as a leader of our generation? What is her effort in challenging the misogyny in the hip hop culture? Why is there even such thing as the “BeyHive”?\n\nFirst, Beyonce is a music sensation. Started out with the group Destiny’s Child, with hits like Say My Name and Survivors, Beyonce’s fame went through the roof. After splitting off of the sisterhood, Beyonce took over the industry with collaborations with Kanye West, her husband Jay Z, Rhianna, etc. Her album Pitchfork was also declared one of the greatest of the decade thus far. She also finished her fifth world tour and two Superbowl’s halftime. Her name is literally worldwide, one of the most well-known name of all time. But her fame isn’t what she wants her audience to know her for, it is what she represents. The youth, the women population, gender equality and power as an individual. Beyonce’s latest, self-titled album contains most of those messages. Songs like Partitions, Girls, Flawless all speaks for the girls in the audience, her female listeners. She believes in bringing women’s power and disadvantage in the last couple of years into the light, showing that although the female population in the world remains unhealthy, unpaid and unfed, they are still powerful. According to Forbes, Beyonce’s salary is almost doubled her husband’s. Her music speaks to the millennial generation because we are all about changes, with gay marriages and races, she pretty much just added another topic for us to take a look at, something that we haven’t paid much attention to. Beyonce could be view as a leader because she uses her fame and popularity to spread awareness about an issue that impacts most of us on a daily, and in most of the case, does not have the voice to speak out against this.\n\nWomen aren’t being viewed as people in rap music videos. You can always expect when turning on the screen to a music video to see a group of women surrounding a male rapper, dancing and worshipping him while he continues rapping. They are either misrepresent, underre present or just plain out getting insulted. For example, in the rapper 50 cent’s music video of the song “Candy Shop”, it depicted a mansion full of women, ready to be purchased just like a candy shop (Dozier). This representation applies false stereotypes on women as submissive, available and easy to obtain, which is borderline just calling a girl a prostitute. Women is also represented as decorations, not the central of attention but more as a way to appeal to a male p\n\nopulation while they listen to the song. In Jay Z’s music video for his song “Big Pimpin”, Jay Z and friends are hanging around a yacht with women laying around in the background. Although most of the camera time was on the women themselves instead of the artist, it’s job was to films their body parts and making it as sexual as possible, their appearance was solely to let the viewers know that the artist himself has a lot of women that wants him and this is what a “Big Pimpin” lifestyle is. Another problem is this give young viewers a message that it is okay to treat women like that and have them dance around you for money, it creates an ownership mentality when it comes to the female population and could be related to the high percentage of sexual assault and harassment in college campuses across the country. Music videos are more direct towards its targets since you can view and see the message that it is portraying but when it comes to lyrics within a song, we sometimes just brush it off our shoulder and move on."
