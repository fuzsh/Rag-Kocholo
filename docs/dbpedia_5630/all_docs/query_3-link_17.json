        "text": "The success of Straight Outta Compton (2015), resurged interest in the story of Eazy E, yet also presented a one-sided, vendetta driven interpretation of history that has solidified myths and lies surrounding a man who is no longer here to defend himself.\n\nAccording to the media and perception of many rap fans, the late Eazy E (real name, Eric Lynn Wright) exists within the dichotomy of being either a bitter, foul-mouthed menace to society, inspiring an anarchist generation addicted to gratuitous violence and drunken with degeneracy or a diminutive imp who concealed his lack of talent behind “ghostwriters”, shrewdly stealing from former friends as the duplicitous jerry Heller quietly pulled Ruthless Records’ strings from the shadows and becoming a punchline for the way he died. Some even jeered, coldly insinuating that the architect behind gangster rap got what he deserved.\n\nHowever, those closest to him remember a different, more complex version of the hip hop giant and business mogul far from the one-dimensional caricature that is typically portrayed.\n\nWright’s children recall his playfulness, laughter, tender affection and affinity for practical jokes as well as spending weekends at his home or taking frequent trips to Disneyland and Magic Mountain while friends and artists speak to the depths of the self proclaimed “hip hop thugsta’s” kindness and gentle nature.\n\nWith such conflicting messages, it can be difficult to discern truth from fiction. I encourage everyone to examine the facts for themselves prior to making judgements about one’s character.\n\nMyth #1: Eazy E and Jerry Heller Stole Money from Artists\n\nContrary to popular belief, Jerry Heller held an established reputation as a music manager, boasting a résumé of industry heavyweights including Marvin Gaye, Ike & Tina Turner, Otis Redding, Black Sabbeth and Van Morrison during the 60s and 70s. Dr. Dre was the first future N.W.A member that Heller came to know, as he managed him during his stint in “The World Class Wreckin’ Crew.”\n\nThe hands of fate intervened, blending every ingredient to yield a cultural revolution on March 3rd 1987, the day Heller met Eazy E and Ruthless Records was born during their meeting at Macola Records in which the hit song “Boyz N the Hood” reached the seasoned manager’s ears for the first time, reinvigorating his passion for the music business. Apparently fate has a sense of humor as well. Who would have thought that a newly divorced, crass aging man from Clevland and a short, stalky Compton native with a mean left hook and sharp business acumen could get along so well?\n\nThe future Ruthless Empire had a diamond in the ruff on its hands, but still required financial backing. Some sources say Eazy contributed $7,000 of his money, made from drug dealing and Heller footed $250,000 of the cost, making up the defecit.\n\nOriginally, Eazy wanted to co-own Ruthless with Jerry 50/50, however, Heller insisted that Eazy be the sole owner, taking 80% while Heller profited from a 20% stake in the company’s earnings.\n\nJerry and Eazy became close, forming a paternal bond were they challenged and taught each other, professionally and personally. They also spent time together on vacations, shared family events, milestones and recreational activities. Jerry was the mentor Eazy needed while Eazy was the son Jerry always wanted. However, their relationship later began to rub people the wrong way.\n\n“Ruthless was Eazy-E’s company. So not only did we live next to each other and have keys to each other’s houses, we always discussed every major decision.” ~Jerry Heller\n\nIce Cube and Dr. Dre exited N.W.A following suspicions of financial impropriety.\n\nIce Cube proclaimed that he wasn’t paid royalties or for going on tour, portaying himself as the groups main writer and mastermind behind Eazy- Duz-It. Cube also alleged that a $75,000 check was being withheld from him by Jerry Heller, who demanded that he sign his contract first.\n\n“Eazy took advantage of me not knowing the record business back in the day,” Dre chimed in, also expressing distain for Heller, painting him as a serpent who maneuvered his way into a position of power and isolated Eazy from his friends.\n\nHeller and Eazy recounted a more nuanced version of events.\n\nHeller noted that Cube’s writing responsibilities and credits were shared with MC Ren, D.O.C, and at the groups’ earliest stage, Arabian Prince, while Dre and DJ Yella co-produced as a team, thus, the royalties had to be divided multiple ways.\n\n“The deal was structured so that Ruthless got a little off the top, and the band split the rest equally. So they split $375,000 five ways, which is $75,000 apiece. That was an astronomical amount of money, and everybody signed their contracts except for Ice Cube. He had a good lawyer, Lee Young, Jr., who used to be the head of business affairs at Motown and a guy that I have done business with over the years and his parents were well educated. Ruthless also had lawyers that looked over everything”\n\nCube received $32,700 in royalties in addition to the $75,000 he wanted, totaling an initial $107,700 in cash. In the years since, all group members have accrued millions in royalties from album sales, preformances and re-releases.\n\nHeller explained that delays between album sales and artist payouts are common.\n\nDavid Kronemyer, a longtime record company executive who worked with Ruthless, seconded this assertion. “It takes a long time and most artists never recoup. Ice Cube did, in fact, recoup in this situation, it just took a long time.”\n\nTo insure that his finances were secure, Ice Cube also enlisted various law firms to inspect the books at Ruthless Records, yet nothing suspect ever appeared in their findings.\n\nConversley, Dre signed his contract (apparently without reading it by his own admission) and later became a disgruntled employee, lamenting the fact that he was supposedly only making 0.02 to 0.10 cents per unit sold.\n\nEazy took the opportunity to set the record straight concerning his business dealings and thirteen year friendship with Dre, who’s departure and subsequent Judas Kiss hit closer to home.\n\n“I was too nice to everybody, I overpaid everybody. I gave people money that they weren’t even owed. I made them happy. I might say okay Dre, here goes $75,000.” He’d say “For what?” and I’d say “Just for being here, cause you're down and you're my buddy.”\n\n“I moved him from Compton and bought a house in Westlake Village. When I moved Dre moved. Dre got a house around the corner from me. I got him a house and we worked everything out”\n\n“ If Jerry was ******* me out of money do you think he’d still be here?” Eazy said bluntly in an interview by Sheena Lester.\n\n“Why aren’t they suing Jerry if he did all this ****?”\n\n“I treated everybody one-hundred-precent fair and square. I’ll put their ******* contracts in your magazine.”\n\n“When we had a meeting and somebody (Ice Cube) sat down and said, I never got this, I never got that. They said all this in front of lawyers. You know what I did? I pulled out all the ******* returned checks that this person signed and said here’s where all that **** came from. They said, Oh, I didn’t know I was getting all that. There’s that $75,000 I told you about in the beginning, why aren’t they suing me?” (Taken from an unknown magazine article on the Tumgir fansite)\n\nHis final recorded conversation with publicist Phyllis Pollack sheds more light on the situation.\n\n“There may be those that hate you, but when you hate them you destroy yourself.” Says Eazy, when questioned about envy being the reason for the backlash against him.\n\n“What sort of misconceptions are out there as far as how you treat your artists?” Pollack inquired.\n\n“I treat my artists real good, I give them fair deals. I start them off at 12 points, with escelation at every 500,000. In the publishing a 50–50 split. Most people take 100% of the artists’ publishing. I know a lot of people who have sold 4 million records and ain’t even seen a million dollars. That ain’t no record deal. Now, I’m not trying to give out any big advances because that’s recoupable, that’s your own money. If you take a big advance you’ll have to pay that back if you don’t sell enough units.”\n\nGary Ballen (Producer and Stage Manager for Ruthless) also came to Heller’s defense.\n\n“Every single expenditure, every single bill was detailed, I couldn’t let a $30 beeper charge go by, I had to itemize everything. People can say whatever they want, I was there.” (Excerpt from The Mysterious Death of Eazy E).\n\nFollowing Eazy’s untimely death, Heller engaged in a legal battle with Tomica Woods-Wright, to whom ownership of the now defunct record company was passed. Eazy’s financial statements and bank accounts were thoroughly investigated by the FBI and no evidence of thievery on Heller’s part was ever found.\n\nHeller revealed that Dre made roughly $82,000 in 1992, though it is unknown how much money he obtained over his four year employment. It is likely that he was compensated well, being that his Calabasas mansion was fashioned with granite counter tops, state of the art technology and custom furniture hand-picked by the producer’s then girlfriend Michel’le. He was also known to throw lavish all-night parties and spend recklessly, particularly on luxury cars like Ferrari’s and BMWs, one of which was an exact model of Eazy E’s.\n\nHeller, in his memoir Ruthless, recalled that he tried to sweeten the deal for Dre by attempting to create a sublabel for him through Warner that, he said, would have paid Dre a $2 million advance. The deal ultimately never came to fruition as Dre infamously became estranged from Eazy by soliciting Suge Knight’s strong arming tactics to break free from his contract, transforming the Starsky and Hutch duo into Cain and Abel. These nefarious activities ultimately backfired, as he was found to be in breach of contract. Eazy gained the last laugh by making 20% of everything Dre touched as an artist and producer for six years.\n\nMyth #2: Eazy Was a Narcissist Who Wanted All of the Attention for Himself\n\nIn the 2003 documentary Beef, Ice cube constructs Eazy as an egomaniacal minion who dipped his hand into the cookie jar one to many times, seeking to promote his image over the best interest of friends.\n\nIn reality Eazy was very shy, particularly around strangers, hence the reason he rarely appeared unadorned by his famous locs and hat. In fact he had to be coaxed into rapping by Dre, who thought his urban grit and distinctive sound would catapult the group to stardom.\n\nThose closest to Eazy commented on his personality, stating that while he remained informed about the company’s inner-workings and made the final call on business decisions, his nature was laid back and agreeable; taking a laissez faire leadership style by delegating tasks, trusting artists with creative license and respecting the expertise of employees.\n\n“He was always pretty calculated in the sense that he always thought things out. He did not work on impulse. He was a guy who would come to the marketing meetings and listen to everything people had to say. I don’t think I’ve ever seen another artist do that.” (Excerpt from All Hip Hop Magazine with Phyllis Pollack; Interview by Greg Watkins, March 27th 2001).\n\nFurthermore, every group member was slated to have a solo project and Eazy-Duz-It was not in fact the first record put out by Ruthless.\n\nAn EP entitled N.W.A and the Posse was released on Nov. 6th 1987, while the groups’ official debut Straight Outta Compton came out the following year on Aug. 8th 1988. Eazy’s first solo album was marketed last beginning on Nov. 23rd 1988. In the interim between N.W.A’s first musical work and the product of their refined technique, girl group JJ Fad’s “Supersonic” took over the charts, establishing Ruthless as a versatile musical entity, rather than a pigeon-holed gangster rap label.\n\nSo why the lies?\n\nPollack has her own theory, echoed by Gary Ballen and Jerry Heller.\n\n“Ice Cube was very jealous of Eric. Eric ran the label, he was more charismatic — the whole thing. Eric and I had our conversations about it when they were in their feud and afterwards.” (Excerpt from Hip Hop DX Interview, September 21st 2016).\n\nMyth #3: Eazy Had No Talent and Didn’t Write His Lyrics\n\nIt is a well established fact that Eazy was not a natural rapper, requiring coaching and numerous recording sessions to perfect his craft, however, this does not mean that the high-pitched performer was not gifted in other areas.\n\nA little known fact is that Eazy played the drums as well as the piano competently, conceptualized videos and even produced music for N.W.A, his own solo projects and Bone Thugs N Harmony in addition to dabbling in the music industry prior to N.W.A, forming a local group called The High Powered DJ Crew.\n\nIt is true that Eazy did not write his own lyrics in the groups’ early days, but neither did Dr. Dre, who’s own magnum opus The Chronic was primarily written by Snoop Dog and various Death Row artists. Eazy began developing his writting capabilities on N.W.A’s final album ******4Life through songs such as “Automobile” and “Approach to Danger”. Eazy also wrote four songs on his EP It’s on Cold187um Dr. Dre Killer, which went double platinum within three months of its debut and remains the only hip hop/gangster rap EP to go multiplatinum. The lead single “Real Compton City G’s” was nominated for a grammy in 1994 along with Dre’s “Nothin’ But a G Thang”. This project was his most successful, cementing him as “The Godfather of Gangster Rap” by the end of 1993 in the conscience of hip hop enthusiasts.\n\nBeyond music, Eazy was a renaissance man, who became proficient in Martial Arts, enjoyed filmmaking, drawing and possessed an affinity for sports including gymnastics, skateboarding and running track.\n\nMyth #4: Eazy E Died Broke\n\nRemove your Cube vision glasses and unclog your Beats by Dre filled ears, because contrary to their egotistical vaudeville act masquerading as a biopic, Eazy E was worth $50 million while Ruthless Records held an estimated value of $30 million at the time of the executive’s passing. He even became one of the highest paid artists in music, receiving 0.68 cents a copy sold on every album Ruthless produced.\n\nEazy’s assests included a number of vehicles and a total of five homes located in Norwalk, Topanga, Westlake, Calabasas and Woodland Hills, the last of which was his most extravagant, sitting atop a picturesque hill in a bucolic setting, concealed from the bustle of society.\n\nA man of style as well as a doting father, he shelled out over $20,000 a year per child to fund a private Christian Montessori school education plus over $50,000 in monthly support and spared no expense on lavish birthday parties, designer clothing, jewelry, the latest toys and gadgets (According to Eric Jr. Sonic Hedgehog was one of their favorite games to play together).\n\nEazy also had his hands in a number of business ventures, from creating his own comic book series entitled The Hood assisted by Rob Leifield (who co-created the character Deadpool) to selling speakers called “Eazy E’s Bass Shakers”, developing a video game, writing a screenplay titled Smiling Faces crafting a biography, opening a film studio and posturing himself to be the first rapper to own a radio station.\n\nBeginning in the summer of 1994, Eazy sought to expand the Ruthless brand by creating The Ruthless Radio Show broadcast by 92.3 The Beat on KDAY radio station. The venture proved to be successful, reaching the #1 position for its time slot.\n\nLastly, according to Eazy’s FBI files, Ruthless was making more than $10 million a month in revenue at the time of his 1995 death, becoming the first independent label to outsell major record companies the following year. Till this day, Eazy’s widow owns N.W.A’s catalog and a portion of royalty checks from old artists still go to the tycoon’s estate according to R&B diva Michel’e. With the advent of streaming services, the money will be pouring in forever.\n\nMyth #5: Eazy Was Selfish and Didn’t Care About Anything\n\nEazy had a soft spot for people and causes shunned, abandoned, disregarded or overlooked by society. He acted upon his empathy on small scales, such as when he purchased ice cream for the neighborhood kids in Compton or spent a Saturday afternoon skateboarding with his young Calabasas neighbors as well as through grand gestures of love.\n\nChristmas came early when Eazy dressed as Santa Clause to distribute gifts, gave turkeys to needy families on Thanksgiving, took his employees’ children on Disney trips, spending more than $600 on merchandise, sponsored rodeo events to expose inner city youth to new cultural pursuits and gave talks to incarcerated adolescents, encouraging them to turn their lives around.\n\nBesides donating time to the community, Eazy gave money to various charities, including City of Hope Memorial Hospital, and participated in Make a Wish Foundation in addition to Athletes and Entertainers for Kids. His contributions notably earned him an invitation for a two day conference/ fundraising event hosted by President H.W Bush in 1991, causing controversy and speculation over the political affiliation of rap’s bad boy. Eazy vehemently denied being a Republican or even voting at all, despite donating $2,500 dollars to an anti-censorship Republican senator, giving to Compton’s Police and Firefighter funds, supporting Officer Briseno in the Rodney King Case and expressing positive feelings towards Bush as well as Ronald Reagan’s economic policies. Not to mention the fact that he clearly supported gun rights.\n\nTruthfully, Eazy’s political affiliation shouldn’t have been important nor a topic of discussion. As a free citizen, he was entitled to associate with whomever he chose and should have been celebrated for his philanthropic work among other humanitarian accomplishments. Being awarded the chance to eat in the company of a U.S president is a great honor to be proud of, wether you like his political party or not.\n\n“I got a kid named Paul Mercado. He has this disease with his spine. It’s\n\ncurving. He’s in a wheelchair. Eventually, his spine might crush him. I\n\nsee him everytime I go to Chicago. I gave him a coat; I only have one\n\nof a kind of it. I gave him a lot of different stuff. I took him up to\n\nthe studio. Some of the juvenile halls I work with include Sylmar; I’m also\n\ngoing to Central and some other ones too. And Fathers Of Juveniles, I\n\nmight do something with them soon.” ~Eazy E\n\n“I honor that brother to this day. My twins were born prematurely and they needed an operation, or else something bad was going to happen. Eric cancelled his meeting (a really important business meeting, like a make or break deal), drove from Calabasas to Fontana California and cashed out $30,000 to save my kids’ lives”\n\n~Kokane from the group “Above The Law”\n\nOn a personal level, Eazy acted as a mentor, protector, friend, brother and father, providing wisdom to those in need, operating as a confidant and pushing people to be better than the ever imagined by recognizing their untapped potential.\n\n“This is a note Eazy-E left on my car after I forgot we were supposed to meet up about my poetry book he was pushing me to publish” (with a cd inserted of me reciting them:) )\n\n“Happy Birthday Eazy! You were one of a kind and a great friend. Thank you” ~Jada Pinkett\n\n“I couldn’t call him Eazy E. I didn’t even know he was Eazy E when I met him. He was Eric and was a nice guy to me. And he taught me a lot of good things. He dressed like Boys in the Hood but it was not who he really was at all! He never came to my house dressed in urban wear. He’d wear tennis shorts and white shirts. He once asked me to give him a lift somewhere. We first stopped at Nordstrom’s where he purchased clothing that Eazy E would sport and changed into them. Eazy E had branded himself before branding was branding.”~Singer Miki Howard\n\n“As a kid I Remember waking up to see his face, and that I will forever cherish!! This man slept under the hospital bed to ensure he did not miss my first days of life and I appreciated every day of life with him. Sometimes I would get into trouble and yell “I WANT MY DADDY!!” If you made a phone call or gave him a minute and he was there! If there were any problems in the neighborhood, he sent the twins (Bodyguards) and Big Man. Regular days, birthdays, holidays…..he was there……I still think about the look he gave us through the restaurant window one morning when we went to eat breakfast and he had to leave…..I miss it all! I will forever be messed up from this, but not all children can say these things….so for that I am forever grateful. The love between us was seen and felt. Thank you Daddy.” ~Erica Wright\n\nConclusion:\n\n“No one survived on the streets without a protective mask. No one survived naked. You had to have a role. You had to be “thug,” “playa,” “athlete,” “gangsta,” or “dope man.” Otherwise, there was only one role left to you: “victim.”\n\n― Jerry Heller, Ruthless: A Memoir\n\nEazy E was multilayered, taking on a differing persona from day to day as a defense mechanism to gaurd himself from a world that was constantly trying to eat away at him. I suppose this is something we all do…… Playing roles to shield ourselves from grotesque realities is intrinsic to the existential agony of our being; thrown into this strange prison cell called life with no escape and a sole alternative that is far more frightening.\n\nSociety has a tendency to sort individuals into rigid dichotomies of angelic or demonic beings, sometimes forcing those who fall short of our hypocritically applied standards of purity to pay penance for their imperfections by scourging them in the court of public opinion and showing wounded hearts no leniency. But what is to become of those souls who’s minds were a cage, with an essence perpetually entrapped between purgatory and hell, pulled between fantasy and reality, only finding freedom to soar above the trials of this world in death?\n\nAdmittedly, I detest gangster rap as I find it to be a toxic, misogynistic, gratuitously violent, pornographic, ignorant, exploitative, stereotypical, half-baked attempt at philosophy perpetuated by rebels without a cause rather than an accurate portrayal of reality. In fact, I do not enjoy rap in general. However, Eazy caught my eye, because the potential within him was greater than his surroundings.\n\nWhen I looked into his eyes, I saw someone who was special with precious gifts, unique insights and a calling upon his life to guide others out of the darkness he faced but didn’t know it. He, like many great men, was misunderstood in terms of his personality, unaware of his internal power and underestimated his influence. It is a shame that his entrepreneurial spirit and foresight are under-appreciated while his contemporaries are praised, especially when he is the tree from which they all branched.\n\nIt is true that Eazy was far from a cardinal saint and that some of his problems were self-inflicted. He made mistakes, committed heinous crimes by stealing, self-reportedly killing and selling harmful substances to his community, was at times reckless with his temper, could demonstrate callousness and created a music genre that arguably caused more harm than good, acting as a regressive social contagion rather than an agent of positive change.\n\nDespite all of these things, he learned from errors, was loving, gentle, a leader, poet and intellectual possessing a soul like a river, flowing with emotions and thoughts running deeper than the sea. People took advantage of his trust, weaponizing his heart against him, yet he never became bitter. He survived a lot, from growing up in Compton, engaging in street fights that permanently scarred his hands, being shot 6 times at point blank range to being the subject of betrayal.\n\nHiding in the crevices of his inner sanctum, there laid a phoenix with a fire dimmed, but not extinguished by trauma, waiting to be reborn through the renewal that only true love can bring. If nothing else, let Eric’s story be an example of the mercy that we must extend to one another, even if it is undeserved and a reminder to treat others with the same grace we would ask for ourselves…..because love is the only antidote to the self-loathing and disillusionment we all need deliverance from.\n\nWe are our own worst enemy and allow evil to persist each time we condemn rather than seek to understand or offer healing through compassion, an action which some have never been offered. This is not to say that people should not be held accountable for the words, choices or actions, but to cement the idea that practicing humility by viewing people in the full scope of their complex nature, seeing beyond the superficial labels we ascribe for selfish reasons, as opposed to demonization, is the key to bringing life, hope, promoting growth and restoring the world.\n\nI am not petitioning anyone to love or even like Eazy E, but do not believe lies or make unfounded criticisms. Eric’s death should not overshadow the positive aspects of his legacy. His life like all lives mattered and he deserves respect for who he was as a man and could have been."
