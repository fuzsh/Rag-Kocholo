        "text": "No, your eyes are not deceiving you.\n\nYes, it is still 2010.\n\nAccording to JJ Fad’s website, the trio best known for their 1988 hit “Supersonic” has reunited and they will be touring with Kid ‘n Play and The Fat Boys. Man, I guess nostalgia has really reached the hip-hop era.\n\nSeveral questions:\n\n?? Would anyone have even paid to see JJ Fad in concert even back in ’88?\n\n?? Is this really JJ Fad performing or did the Weather Girls decide to start a rap career and add a third member?\n\n?? JJ Fad only had one hit. Is their set going to be a half hour extended remix of “Supersonic”?\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_tIlVT1iDg\n\n?? How come Oaktown’s .357 isn’t on this tour?\n\n?? Isn’t Chris “Play” Martin a pastor or a born again Christian?\n\n?? Aren’t both Kid AND Play in their late forties? Can they still do the kickstep?\n\n?? Is Chris “Kid” Reid gonna grow the high-top fade back?\n\n?? Why didn’t they get Full Force to co-headline?\n\n?? Umm…isn’t the Human Beat Box dead?\n\nThis tour looks to be all sorts of a hot mess. Unintentional comedy at it’s finest. While I certainly wouldn’t object to seeing some of our old school legends on tour (I can list a ton of emcees from the Eighties and Nineties) I’d go see in a heartbeat, some acts should probably leave well enough alone."
