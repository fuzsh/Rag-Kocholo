        "text": "He recorded his first commercial vocal work as a rapper in 1997 under the name ‘Puff Daddy’. The debut single, “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down”, spent 28 weeks on the Billboards top 100, making it to number 1. The album was released in 1996 through Bad Boy records named “No Way Out” and featured appearance by many label artists. It went through many changed after The Notorious B.I.G. died but it still managed to reach number 1 on Billboard 200 in the first week after release and selling 561,000. The album had 5 singles: “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down”, “It’s all about the Benjamin’s”, “Been around the World”, and “Victory”. “I’ll Be Missing You”, a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G., was the first rap song to be number 1 on Billboard Hot 100 and remained there for 11 consecutive weeks. The album was certified septuple platinum in 2000 for selling 7 million copies. It was also nominated for 5 Grammys in 1998 and went on to win “Best Rap Album” and “I’ll Be Missing You” won for “Best Rap Performance by a Duo or\n\nThe black community is changing and the hip hop is changing as well. Many of the founders of this genre have found success and fame. They have become producers and have their own recording label. This is the case of Jay Z who is has a music service designed to put the power back into the hands of the artist. This is very encouraging because it will allow the artist to be true to his art and not hold back because he needs to follow what the big corporations feel is profitable. In the case of singer, actor and producer, Ice Cube, his attitude toward his art have changed. At the beginning, he was angry and wanted to express that frustration through his music and he wrote the song, “Fuck Tha Police”. Now, he understands that saying fuck\n\nThe track is not credited to Black Hippy; instead, it is credited to each ScHoolboy Q with a feature from Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, and Jay Rock. While it is by no means the best work of any of the group members, it proved they had undeniable chemistry that would flourish if their talents were cultivated. The second song on which all the Black Hippy members appeared was “Welcome to C4” on Lamar’s mixtape, C4; however, once again the features were credited to each individual artist rather than to Black Hippy. The next three tracks on which all the Black Hippy members were featured — “Top Dawg Cypha” from Q’s Gangsta & Soul as well as “TDE Roll Call” and “I Do It 4 Hip Hop” from Rock’s 30 Day Takeover — all lacked credits to Black Hippy, instead following suit by listing each individual member. , Finally in 2010, the song “Shadow of Death” on Jay Rock’s Black Friday was credited to Black Hippy, marking the first release of music crediting the name of the group. Again in 2011, the initial studio albums released by each member of the crew (excluding Kendrick Lamar’s Section.80) included tracks credited to the group’s name. ,\n\nIt’s haunting, it’s jarring, it’s loud, it’s in your face, Ice Cube’s second album Death Certificate is a lot of things the one thing it’s not though is nice. The album opens up with the song “Wrong N**ga to F**K with”, an intense song that goes straight for the jugular. Ice Cube’s lyrical assault on everything wrong with authority, the Justice System, racism and more begins there, where he talks about beating LAPD police chief Daryl Gates, running with his posse Lench Mob; in “Wrong N**ga to F**K with” he basically says that he’s coming for everyone no holds barred. Death Certificate challenges the white supremacist the status quo because it’s a work of art that brought the problems that many people of color in America faced back into public attention, problems that white people had just swept under the rug. He questioned the fairness of authority, brought up the issue of racial profiling and called out anyone and everyone he could. With Death Certificate Ice Cube examined racism, created a national conversation on poverty, censorship, free speech, and violence which reenergized the quest in a new, younger generation for equality.\n\nEminem’s journey to fame also contributed to his recognition and respect from the hip-hop industry. A white person such as himself rapping was amusing to most of the underground rap industry. Finally, when he was down to his last penny trying to convince labels to sign him into their studio, he signed up for the 1997 Rap Olympics. His goal was to win the $1,500 cash prize which he was desperate for. After battling for a solid hour and reciprocating every racial slur thrown at him, Mathers got second place. Enraged at the fact that he had lost, Mathers didn’t even realize that some producers from Interscope Records had spotted him and they were given a copy of his “Infinite” playlist as a kind of demo. Dr. Dre, from N.W.A., was widely respected and eventually he tracked Eminem down. They produced several tracks together for Eminem’s first studio LP (Long-Playing) album. After their first collaboration and Eminem’s first glimpse at fame, the set off to make Eminem’s second LP album. The album was named “The Marshall Mathers LP” and it earned Eminem three Grammies and it was the first rap album ever to be nominated “Album of the year”, selling more than 8 million records in the United States alone. Later in 2002, Eminem’s rise to respectability was curved up exponentially after the release of his first film 8 Mile. 8 Mile also inspired a major hit and double Grammy winner, “Lose Yourself”, increasing the power of his name in hip-hop.\n\nThe 1980s were a turning point in the world of Hip Hop, LL Cool J ran the Hip Hop music industry east coast, it was time for the west coast to be put on the map, and the first rap group to do that was N.W.A. With the release of their song “Straight out of Compton” they brought light to the hardships and struggles of growing up on the streets of Los Angeles. After a quick rise to fame they released “F*ck The Police” which depicted the violent, mistreatment they received from the Los Angeles Police Department. The famed “F*ck The Police” was released in 1988, and debuted on the groups second studio album “Straight Out of Compton”. Some say their most successful album; including other chart topping hits like “Express Yourself” and “Gangsta Gangsta”.\n\nIn 2012, Eastside Eazy dropped his first official single titled \"Countin My Money\" and did a small tour. However, things didn't go as planned, due to mismanagement of the budget caused in a decline in the success of their tour. Determined to succeed, Eazy dropped a collaborative mixtape titled “Jungle Life,” in 2013, which featured T-Real, Kiing Chuck, Stones, and Bank Hank. Unfortunate times struck again in 2014, when Kiing Chuck was murdered in his own home. Subsequently, Eazy took a step back from performing and recording music to focused on his\n\nBefore rap became crap, rap was the new thing to listen to in the 80’s. You had guys rapping about the silliest things. Food, basketball, gym shoes, getting paid were common in the early 80’s then as rap grew rappers were rappin’ about Black empowerment, stopping Black-on-Black crime, unity yet you still rappers rappin’ about their radio and about their parents and that was cool. Then, you had rappers testing the boundaries. Rappers would rap about sex. Raunchy, but not violent. You even had rappers who made it big not by rappin’ but by dancing. As the 80’s was nearing an end, a new type of rap would go from underground to mainstream. Gangsta rap would take center stage changing the rap game forever. Gangsta rap glorify killing niggas over and over and rappers would boast about killing niggas over and over. I was a fan of NWA and I was bobbing my head hearing Ice Cube rap in my\n\n“Gangsta rap” has been around since the late 1980s, and has been categorized as a specific type of hip hop. Reflecting the violent lifestyles of many black American youths living within the inner cities of the West and East coast, gangsta rap became a voice. The genre reflected on and spoke about the harsh realities of what life for a black person during the 1980s. One of the most prominent rap names during this era that became the voice for many people throughout the nation was the N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitude) rap group. Originally from the streets of Compton, California, these teenagers decided to take on a risk, tackling the music industry head on, publishing their own works that spoke out against corruption. The creation of hip hop’s sub genre, “gangsta rap” during the late 1980s not only sparked widespread controversy, but also gave black communities a prominent identity within their hip hop movement of the arts; it offered the nation an understanding of the “black struggle” through lyrics and went against established culture."
