Fad was the first female rap group to have a certified gold album?\n\nThe group is still touring and have been acknowledged by Fergie through her song, “Fergalicious,” and Eminem honored the ladies on his single, “Rap God.”\n\nI had the pleasure of having girl talk with J. J. Fad about their incredible journey from working with NWA, touring with Will Smith (Fresh Prince back in the day) and Run-D.M.C., and they gave their opinion about women in the music industry. They have the perfect cure for the Nicki Minaj and Cardi B beef!\n\nListen in to the interview, plus I’ll give an affirmation for the week, music motivation and celebrate a woman."
