        "text": "American hip hop group\n\nJ.J. Fad is an American female rap group from Rialto, California. The name was an acronym of the original group members' given names (Juana, Juanita, Fatima, Anna, and Dana), but when the line-up changed the tradition developed that it stood for Just Jammin', Fresh and Def.[1] The group was backed by DJ Train (Clarence Lars).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBeginnings\n\n[edit]\n\nJ.J. Fad began in 1985 as a quintet comprising Juana Burns (MC J.B.), Dana Birks (Baby-D), Anna Cash (Lady Anna), Fatima Shaheed (O.G. Rocker) and Juanita Lee (Crazy J.). It was one of the original acts signed to Ruthless Records by Eazy-E. In 1987, this line-up released its only recording, the single \"Anotha Ho\" backed with \"Supersonic\" (\"Anotha Ho\" was the A-side), produced by Arabian Prince.[2][3]\n\nSupersonic\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to management and financial disagreements, Cash, Shaheed and Lee quit the group, leaving J.J. Fad as a duo. The remaining original members (Burns and Birks) were joined by Michelle Franklin (Sassy C.) and DJ Train, and together they re-recorded and re-released \"Supersonic\" in 1988, this time as the A-side. It sold 400,000 copies independently before Eazy-E and Jerry Heller secured the group a major-label recording contract with Atco Records.\n\nThe single was followed by the album Supersonic, produced by Arabian Prince, who made J.J. Fad accessible to pop audiences—unlike many West Coast rappers of the day—by including electro elements in their music. Due to their involvement with Ruthless Records, co-producer credits were added for Dr. Dre and DJ Yella.\n\nBoth the single \"Supersonic\" and the album Supersonic were certified gold.[4] (The group believes the single sold 1 million copies in the U.S.—equivalent to platinum status—but this has not been certified.)[5]\n\nNot Just a Fad\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Eazy and Heller enjoying success with N.W.A, it was three years before J.J. Fad returned with a follow-up album. Not Just a Fad was released in 1991, produced by Arabian Prince, Yella and overseen by Eazy, but failed to make an impact. The group disbanded shortly afterward. DJ Train died in 1994 of smoke inhalation.\n\nLater years\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter almost two decades out of the music industry raising families, the classic trio of J.J. Fad reunited. The group performs at old-school and freestyle concerts.\n\nIn 2004, MF Doom sampled the beatboxing intro from the 1988 video for \"Supersonic\" in his song \"Hoecakes\" from his album Mm.. Food.\n\nIn 2006, Fergie used an interpolation of \"Supersonic\" in her song \"Fergalicious\".\n\n\"Supersonic\" appeared in the music video game Dance Central 3 (2012), which J. J. Fad promoted on its Facebook page.\n\nThe 2015 biopic film Straight Outta Compton left out the story of J. J. Fad and how some in the media felt the group was responsible for \"forging a path for the breakout success of N.W.A\".[6]\n\nThe second trailer for the 2020 movie Sonic the Hedgehog features the song \"Supersonic\".\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions Certifications US\n\n[7] US\n\nR&B\n\n/HH\n\n[8] Supersonic\n\nReleased: July 5, 1988\n\nLabel: Ruthless/Atco\n\nFormats: CD, LP, cassette, digital download, streaming\n\n49 20\n\nRIAA: Gold[9]\n\nNot Just a Fad\n\nReleased: December 7, 1990\n\nLabel: Ruthless\n\nFormats: CD, LP, cassette, digital download, streaming\n\n— — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nAs lead artist\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles, with selected chart positions and certifications, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[10] US Dance\n\n[11] US R&B\n\n[12] \"Anotha Ho\"[13] 1987 — — — Non-album single \"Supersonic\" 1988 30 10 22\n\nRIAA: Gold[9]\n\nSupersonic \"Way Out\" 61 — 51 \"Is It Love\" 92 — — \"We in the House\"[14] 1990 — — — Not Just a Fad \"Be Good Ta Me\"[15] 1991 — — — \"Supersonic (Re-Recorded/Remastered)\"[16] 2009 — — — Hip Hop Soundtrack To The Concrete Jungle \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nFeatured singles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of featured singles, with selected chart positions Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[10] US R&B\n\n[12] US Rap\n\n[17] AUS\n\n[18] NZ\n\n[18] \"We're All in the Same Gang\"\n\n(as part of The West Coast Rap All-Stars) 1990 35 10 1 106 11\n\nRIAA: Gold[19]\n\nWe're All in the Same Gang \"Fellas\"\n\n(Ozomatli featuring J.
