        "text": "1993 was the greatest year in the history of rap music - the year that Snoop Dogg released the greatest rap single of all time:\n\n“Who Am I (What’s My Name)?”\n\nBut how could a 22-year-old from Long Beach who had until that point spent his adult life in and out of prison release the greatest rap party jam of all time? Give me 93 DAZE to explain.\n\nI'll try to connect the dots by starting with Clyde Stubblefield, James Brown's drummer who more or less invented the funk drumming that became the first drum breaks that were ever played on tandem records by Kool DJ Herc at his Bronx warehouse parties in the 1970s. I'll jump across the Caribbean to Jamaica, the birthplace of rapping and sampling, then back to America, where funk music was evolving into Blaxpoitation, jazz fusion and disco. We'll talk about the influences that Afro-futurism, gay club culture, and Italo-disco had on hip hop. Then we'll delve into the history of hip hop and the cuts that were sampled.\n\n*this was originally a Tumblr (which took me more than 93 daze to complete). See it in its original form here: http://93daze.tumblr.com/\n\nDay 1: Funkadelic - (Not Just) Knee Deep (1979)\n\nHere it is: the backbone of \"Who Am I (What's My Name?\" - just a couple bars of synth bass breakdown at 0:52, and throughout (with a good, clean sample at 13:24).\n\n\"(Not Just) Knee Deep\" was sampled in 110 songs - most notably De La Soul’s \"Me Myself and I,\" Dre’s\" Fuck Wit’ Dre (And Everybody’s Celebratin’)\", 2Pac’s \"Can’t C Me,\" and of course Snoop's \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\"\n\nI particularly appreciate two things about Dre and Snoop’s use of this song:\n\n#1: (They continue with) Funkadelic's parentheses thing.\n\n#2: Dr. Dre had the humility to try this sample a second time for the production of Who Am I, after his - let’s say - not quite bangin’ song.\n\nDe La Soul uses the beginning. Dre/Snoop/Pac use 0:52.\n\nDay 2: The Honey Drippers - Impeach the President (1972)\n\n\"Impeach the President\" was named by WhoSampled.com as the most sampled drum break of all time.\n\nIt seems like this information might have changed, but the message is clear: this is a crucial break and the backbone of hundreds of hip hop tracks from the 1980s to today.\n\nI don’t want to harp too much on the “crucial drum breaks” because I’ve only got #93DAZE, I’m not a hip hop producer, there are MUCH better sources out there, and honestly a lot of the important drum breaks appear in songs that aren't that aren't as good as the tracks that sampled them.\n\nThis track is not only a great break, but a great track. Enjoy!\n\nDay 3: James Brown/Clyde Stubblefield - Cold Sweat (1968)\n\n\"Let’s give The Drummer Some!\" James proposes at 2:15.\n\nAnd the drummer takes some, laying down a boom-bap drum break that anyone could have rapped over anytime from 1977 to 2077.\n\nClyde Stubblefield was fundamentally responsible for funk music. When he started playing for James Brown, there was a new rhythm.\n\nStubblefield played on what were considered to be the first funk tracks, and he played many of what would become the most important drum breaks in hip hop like “Funky Drummer\" and \"Cold Sweat.\"\n\nDay 4: Count Machuki - More Scorcher (1969)\n\nFunk was the original beat for hip hop, but \"Toasting\" was the original rapping. And Count Machuki was the original \"deejay\" - toasting over Coxsone Dodd’s Sound Dimension.\n\nToasting came into existence the same way as any other great invention: at the spur of the moment, out of necessity. Traveling “sound systems” were a major phenomenon in Jamaica, touring Kingston’s ghettos in trucks with huge speakers. “Selectors” (DJs) played the records and “deejays” (MCs) were the hype men. The sound systems were highly competitive, and a good deejay was indispensable. They’d call people out, make jokes, talk jive, and rap over the “version” (the instrumental side).\n\nThis was unfortunately not a genre that was recorded until the later 1960s as the deejay’s job was to work a crowd, but here’s a classic early Machuki jam recorded in 1968.\n\nDay 5: Lee Perry - Kimble the Nimble (1968)\n\nLee Perry was to Bob Marley what Lou Reed was to The Beatles: a meaner, more mocking view of the world at a time where “peace and love” sold records.\n\nI could easily post #93DAZE of Lee Perry + Upsetters songs, but that wouldn’t get us to our goal of 1993 and Snoop. Lee Perry didn’t invent dub, but he was certainly the most successful at turning it into its own “thing.” Lee’s spirit of experimentation had a massive effect on the future of electronic music and hip hop.\n\nHere’s Dave Barker and the Upsetters over Small Axe.\n\nDay 7: John Holt - Ali Baba (+ versions)\n\nJohn Holt’s song is just great on its own (particularly when accompanied by this wacky video someone made). But the beautiful thing about Jamaican music in the 60s, 70s, 80s (and so on), was that when a good record came out, there might be countless \"versions\" of the same tune made by other artists. In fact, playing songs over an existing song became such a standard practice that the concept of \"riddims\" exists in Jamaica, meaning essentially the same thing as a jazz standard (e.g. here's a playlist of songs over the Ali Bab riddim). There is no doubt that hip hop and its founder, Jamaican-born Kool DJ Herc were influenced by Jamaica's limitlessly creative recycling of records.\n\nAli Baba versions:\n\nIt sounds bizarre now, but before “I Feel Love,” there had never been an entirely electronically-produced disco song.\n\nGiorgio Moroder’s production changed the course of disco music and all dance music afterward.\n\nHere’s a quote from David Bowie:\n\n\"One day in Berlin … Eno came running in and said, ‘I have heard the sound of the future.’ … he puts on \"I Feel Love,\" by Donna Summer … He said, \"This is it, look no further. This single is going to change the sound of club music for the next fifteen years.\" Which was more or less right.\"\n\nDay 44: Sylvester - You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) (1978)\n\nRoger Troutman was a protege of Bootsy Collins before he and his four brothers made their first Zapp album, but Zapp ended their P-Funk ties when they took their Bootsy-produced, George Clinton-funded album and sold it to Warner Brothers instead of George Clinton’s short-lived Uncle Jam records.\n\nThat’s pretty gangster, I guess, and maybe part of the reason why every West Coast gangsta rapper sampled Zapp (Tupac has something like a 1.3:1 Zapp sample per track ratio).\n\nIt’s kind of a shame that Zapp’s first track on their first album is their most-remembered song but I guess that’s what you get for leaving the mothership..\n\nDay 58: Roger Troutman - Do it Roger (1981)\n\nIn September 1979, Blondie, Chic, and the Clash were playing a show. When Chic played “Good Times,” The Sugar Hill Gang bum rushed the stage and started rapping over the music. A record was released shortly after with a preliminary version of “Rapper’s Delight” over the music from “Good Times.” Chic and their label ended up suing the Sugar Hill Gang, making a deal with them, and re-recording the version of “Rapper’s Delight” that we all know and love - with a share of the royalties.\n\n…or so the story goes.\n\n\"Rapper’s Delight\" was the first true rap hit, which was funny because the Sugar Hill Gang, according to the heads of the time, were not really part of the scene.\n\nDay 68: Spyder D - Big Apple Rappin’ (1980)\n\nKevin Donovan was a Warlord of the New York gang the Black Spades - which ballooned during his time to the largest street gang in New York.\n\nHis worldview shifted, however - around the same time he won a UNICEF essay contest that gave him a trip to Africa - and he ended up founding the Universal Zulu Nation, a hip hop and B-boy cultural organization comprised initially of many former Black Spades.\n\nBambaataa was known as the godfather of electro funk and also reputed to be one of the original crate diggers.\n\nPlanet Rock samples two Kraftwerk songs, Babe Ruth’s “The Mexican,” and a 1982 computer sound effects program.\n\nDay 74: Jonzun Crew - Space Cowboy (1983)\n\nFour brothers from Boston (actual brothers), the Jonzun Crew rapped over electro-funk with an afro-futuristic theme. And they were bad (as in good)!\n\nHowever, the Jonzun Crew’s biggest contribution to pop culture was founding member Maurice Starr going on to manage and produce New Edition (before they went on to their own respectively successful careers). When New Edition and Starr parted way, Starr attempted to assemble and produce a version of New Edition with white kids.\n\n\"I honestly believe that if they’d been white, (New Edition) would have been 20 times as big.\" Starr said in a 2013 Entertainment Weekly article.\n\nStarr found Donny Wahlberg who impressed him with his rapping and dancing skills. Wahlberg recruited his little brother Mark, his best friend Danny Wood and some schoolmates who knew how to sing, Jordan and Jonathan Knight. The result was New Kids on the block and indeed they were 20x as popular as New Edition.\n\nDay 75: Cybotron - Clear (1983)\n\n\"Deep Cover\" was the first Dre track after his breakup with N.W.A. and it featured the first appearance on record of Dre’s new protege, Snoop Doggy Dogg.\n\nNote Snoop’s comparatively silky flows: “And now they wanna make a deal wit me/scoop me up and put me on they team and chill wit me.”\n\nWho WOULDN’T want to scoop Snoop up and put him on their team and chill with him?! Dre had clearly found the right dogg.\n\nDay 86: Mac Dre - California Livin’ (1991)\n\nThis is the video that implanted in my suburban 5th-grader mind what “gangsta” culture looked like. Sure, Dr Dre might have been rocking a decidedly \"less gangsta\" look in 1985 - as Eazy E LOVED to point out - but who wasn’t less gangsta in 1985?\n\nThankfully the tide of violence and misogyny in rap hit a high water mark in the 90s, and receded back into the ocean of pop music. But let us remember this era for Dre’s production and Snoop’s flow rather than Suge Knight and East Coast-West Coast Beef.\n\nDay 88: Ice Cube - It Was a Good Day (1993)\n\nNo document about 1990s hip hop would be complete without mentioning Naughty By Nature.\n\n\"O.P.P.\" might be their most memorable single, but \"Hip Hop Hooray\" was their peak. Spike Lee directed the video. Eazy E produced it (and appeared in the video). They lived in New Jersey but were homies with Tupac. They even had their own bedsheets (1:25). 1993 was a good time to be alive for the boys from East Orange, NJ.\n\nDay 90: Tag Team - Whoomp! (There It Is) (1993)\n\nWhoomp is probably the first international Miami Bass hit, following 2 Live Crew getting close (but too explicit for mainstream success), and followed by the Quad City DJ’s crossover success with Space Jam.\n\nWhoomp samples Kano’s “I’m Ready” - and in my opinion improves dramatically on that already-remarkable song!\n\nAs much as I love the fact that DC and Steve Roll’n are from Denver, Colorado, I’ve got to say that their other singles are super wack and it’s no surprise that they only had one hit.\n\nIf you don’t already know, there was a similar Miami Bass song called “Whoot There It Is” by 95 South that came out one month earlier. But since this was already a sort of Miami club call-out with two groups capitalizing on it, there is no animosity between the two groups.\n\nWu-Tang was like nothing before. The RZA’s sinister production gave a sound to the truly dangerous, gritty experience of life in “Shaolin” - sampling his own world-class import kung fu film collection and various brooding, mid-60s soul singles.\n\nAnd the collection of personalities that made up the clan - then their excellent and perfectly-timed subsequent solo albums - was a phenomenon that won’t be repeated anytime soon.\n\nC.R.E.A.M. samples a couple very short snippets of the Charmels’ \"As Long As I’ve Got You\"\n\nDay 92: A Tribe Called Quest - Award Tour (1993)\n\nI’m probably ascribing a historical connection to two events that didn’t have a damn thing to do with one another, but here goes anyway:\n\nOn November 9th, 1993, two crucial hip hop albums were released: Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and Midnight Marauders.\n\nThe Wu Tang Clan sounded like the future. A Tribe Called Quest.. more like the past. If you want to pull out one single event from 1993 to create the supporting towers for the bridge to post-1993 rap, look no further. This was the last great Tribe record and the very beginning of a million great Wu-Tang spin-offs.\n\nNone of this should take anything away from Midnight Marauders, though, because Midnight Marauders is undoubtedly one of the essential albums that made 1993 the pinnacle of rap music!\n\nDay 93: Snoop Dogg - Who Am I (What's My Name?) (1993)\n\nFrom the Counts’ ultra-hype hook, into the best use of the Not Just Knee Deep (Day #1) bass of all time (and that’s REALLY saying something!), Dre piles on FOUR P-FUNK SAMPLES, punctuated by some high-pitched synth strings over a chorus of angels, or maybe witches, singing their siren incantation,\n\n\"Snooooop Doooawggeeh Daaaaaawwww-ooh-aw-ah-oggg\"\n\nThis is already the best rap song of the 90s before Snoop opens his mouth. Dre must have re-recorded the bass or put it on the P Funk Mothership, sent it to a funkier galaxy for remastering, then sampled it a second time!\n\nMeanwhile Snoop waits out his ten perfect measures, then LAYS THAT SHIT DOWN!\n\nThose relaxed rhythms! Those flamboyant flourishes! That stylized pronunciation! Over that beat!\n\nThis is the Snoop we know and this is where it all happened.\n\n1993 ended a month later but it lives on forever as the pinnacle of hip hop's golden age.\n\nJah Bless!\n\nDogg out!"
