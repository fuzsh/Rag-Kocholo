        "text": "The west coast electro sound that became popular in the first half of the 80s was fading, paving the way to Gangsta rap: a new style of hip-hop that would explode shortly after that favoring more aggressive lyrics and hard-hitting beats.\n\nThe most prominent acts of the west coast electro-funk scene were Egyptian Lover, The LA Dream Team, Arabian Prince, World Class Wreckin' Cru, Jamie Jupitor, The Unknown DJ, and Uncle Jamm's Army.\n\nIt's composed of groovy electronic drums, catchy rhymes, powerful human beatbox, and dope scratches. When you listen to it once, it will be difficult for you not to play it again and again…\n\n\"Supersonic\" is a perfect blend of hip-hop and electro minus the gangsta attitude that will become famous at the end of the 80s/beginning of the 90s with bands like N.W.A, Compton's most wanted or Fila Fresh Crew. However, JJ Fad released \"Supersonic\" and two albums with Ruthless Records, run by hip-hop legend Eazy-E's (Rest in Power).\n\nThe group was founded in 1987 in Rialto, California, and it was initially a female rap quintet. They originally wanted to form a female group representing the west coast hip-hop scene. JJ Fad was an acronym of their names: Juana, Juanita, Fatima, Lady Anna, and Denea (JJ FAD).\n\nTogether in 1987, they released the dissing track called \"Anotha Ho\" and \"Supersonic,\" although two of the girls left after the release of the first single.\n\nThe group then became a trio composed of three female MCs called Sassy C, MC JB, and Baby D with the help of DJ Train (RIP) from the group CPO on the turntables. The all-female trio is the classic lineup that still plays live shows today.\n\nThe first version of \"Supersonic\" was initially released on Dream Team records in 1987, a Los Angles record label owned by the LA Dream Team. \"Supersonic\" was released on the B-side with song production initially supervised by Arabian Prince.\n\nIn 1988 JJ Fad signed with Ruthless Records, and \"Supersonic\" was then remixed by Arabian Prince and Dr. Dre and re-released as the leading single.\n\nJJ Fad, during an interview, recalled that Dre was very professional in the studio, asking them to record their verses multiple times until they were perfect, teaching them a great work ethic.\n\n\"Supersonic\" became a hit, selling more than 500,000 copies and peaking at no.33 of the Billboard chart, reaching Gold status. JJ Fad is also the first all-female rap group nominated for a Grammy award.\n\nA couple of months later, they released their first album, also named \"Supersonic,\" and it was certified gold like the single. In 1990 they released the follow-up album called \"Not Just a Fad,\" produced by DJ Yella, but it did not perform well in the charts like their previous album. After DJ Train died from smoke inhalation in 1994, the group then took a hiatus and came back performing live in the mid-2000s.\n\n\"Supersonic\" is a hip-hop electro classic still popular today. The new generation of producers and artists still pay homage to this wonderful song in their tracks. It was sampled by Fergie and Will. I. Am. (who was also signed to Ruthless record at the beginning of his career) in Fergie's smash hit \"Fergalicious\" by legendary MC MF Doom (RIP) on \"Hoecakes\" and was recently interpolated on \"Rap God\" by Eminem.\n\nThis song is a timeless west coast classic. It's also a b-boy classic and inspired human beatboxers too. It's just one of those songs you can listen to countless times and never get tired of hearing!"
