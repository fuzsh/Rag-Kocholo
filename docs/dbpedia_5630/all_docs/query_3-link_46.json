        "meta_description": "Abstract Since 1950, there has been an increase in rainfall over North West Australia (NWA), occurring mainly during the Southern Hemisphere (SH) summer season. A recent study using twentieth-century multimember ensemble simulations in a global climate model forced with and without increasing anthropogenic aerosols suggests that the rainfall increase is attributable to increasing Northern Hemisphere aerosols. The present study investigates the dynamics of the observed trend toward increased rainfall and compares the observed trend with that generated in the model forced with increasing aerosols. It is found that the observed positive trend in rainfall is projected onto two modes of variability. The first mode is associated with an anomalously low mean sea level pressure (MSLP) off NWA instigated by the enhanced sea surface temperature (SST) gradients toward the coast. The associated cyclonic flows bring high-moisture air to northern Australia, leading to an increase in rainfall. The second mode is associated with an anomalously high MSLP over much of the Australian continent; the anticyclonic circulation pattern, over northern Australia, determines that when rainfall is anomalously high, west of 130°E, rainfall is anomalously low east of this longitude. The sum of the upward trends in these two modes compares well to the observed increasing trend pattern. The modeled rainfall trend, however, is generated by a different process. The model suffers from an equatorial cold-tongue bias: the tongue of anomalies associated with El Niño–Southern Oscillation extends too far west into the eastern Indian Ocean. Consequently, there is an unrealistic relationship in the SH summer between Australian rainfall and eastern Indian Ocean SST: the rise in SST is associated with increasing rainfall over NWA. In the presence of increasing aerosols, a significant SST increase occurs in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. As a result, the modeled rainfall increase in the presence of aerosol forcing is accounted for by these unrealistic relationships. It is not clear whether, in a model without such defects, the observed trend can be generated by increasing aerosols. Thus, the impact of aerosols on Australian rainfall remains an open question.",

        "text": "a. Seasonal stratification of trends and variability\n\nNWA is a warm-month rainfall region, and is strongly influenced by the Australian summer monsoon. As such, most of the annual total rainfall is recorded in summer (DJF), which is about 10 times greater than that in the winter (JJA) season (Fig. 2, left column). In association, although the trend over NWA shows up in the annual mean map, it is primarily a summertime phenomenon (Fig. 2e, right column). The percentage (figure not shown) of increase is also substantial; over most of NWA the increase is greater than 20% over the past 50 yr. By contrast, a reduction occurs over most of eastern Australia in DJF. In other seasons, the trend over NWA is small in absolute terms. The decreasing rainfall trend over eastern Australia (25°S southward), shown in Fig. 1, occurs mainly in the JJA season.\n\nTo understand the dynamics of the rainfall trend it is necessary to examine the dynamics of rainfall variability as the response to a climate change forcing that might project onto the existing modes of variability. To this end we use linearly detrended data. Rainfall variability over Australia is region specific because it can be predominately driven by one of the global-scale modes of variability, while simultaneously affected by other modes. Further, the relative importance of these modes varies seasonally, as will be clear in the ensuing analysis, which is necessary for benchmarking the performance of the model used by Rotstayn et al. (2007).\n\nFigure 3 shows maps of correlation between the observed NWA rainfall (averaged over 10°–25°S, 110°–135°E; land points only) and gridpoint global SST for each season. In DJF (Fig. 3a), although the correlation pattern in the Pacific displays a La Niña–like pattern, most of the correlation coefficients have an absolute value of less than 0.27 (a threshold required for a 95% level of statistical significance). Correlation between the NWA-detrended rainfall time series and the detrended Niño-3.4 index records a coefficient of 0.29, which is marginally greater than the value for 95% statistical significance. The weak correlation is consistent with the canonical Australian rainfall–ENSO relationship (e.g., Ropelewski and Halpert 1987), which depicts an influence mostly over eastern Australia. In the Indian Ocean, the correlation is generally greater than in the Pacific. As will be shown, the overall pattern is similar to that associated with a La Niña phase. In particular, an east–west temperature gradient along 20°S is rather prominent, with cooling taking place off the Western Australia (WA) coast, and relative warming along the coast.\n\nIn autumn (MAM) there is little significance in the correlation between NWA rainfall and SST (Fig. 3b). The overall pattern is one that evolves from Fig. 3a, with a decaying La Niña in the Pacific and westward-propagating anomalies in the southern tropical Indian Ocean. In JJA (Fig. 3c), the correlation is much stronger and there is a well-defined correlation pattern, resembling the map Nicholls (1989) obtained by correlating southeastern Australian rainfall with SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean. Recent studies have shown that this pattern can evolve into an IOD, which is a coupled ocean–atmospheric phenomenon (Saji et al. 1999) that usually starts in JJA and peaks in spring (SON). The IOD linkage to Australian wintertime rainfall variations has been explored recently, and is found to consist of a broad band stretching from the EIO, to the northwest and southeast of the continent (e.g., Ashok et al. 2003; Cai et al. 2005a). This is reproduced here (Figs. 3c,d). Since 1950, some IOD events occur coherently with an ENSO event because of their seasonal phase-locking properties (Yamagata et al. 2004), giving rise to the strong ENSO-like pattern in the Pacific (Fig. 3d), with the majority of correlations statistically significant at the 95% level.\n\nThe above analysis indicates a strong linkage of NWA JJA and SON rainfall with the IOD and ENSO, but such a linkage is weak in DJF. In particular, warm Indian Ocean SSTs in DJF are not associated with an increase in NWA rainfall (Fig. 3a). To further illustrate this, we take a time series of seasonal mean Niño-3.4 and EIO SST anomalies (averaged over 5°–15°S, 90°–110°E) and correlate them with gridpoint rainfall anomalies of the same season. The results are shown in the left column of Fig. 4 (red color indicating drier-than-normal conditions) for Niño-3.4 and in the right column for EIO SST. We have also calculated correlation with Niño-3 (5°S–5°N, 90°–150°W), and we find that the correlation maps are similar, consistent with the finding of a recent study (Ashok et al. 2007b).\n\nIn DJF (Fig. 4, left column) ENSO has a weak effect on NWA rainfall, with warmer SST in the equatorial eastern Pacific tending to reduce NWA rainfall. A sizable correlation exists in a strip extending from central-northern Australia to the southeastern regions. In eastern Australia, a significant correlation is seen; this is the well-known ENSO–eastern Australia rainfall teleconnection (McBride and Nicholls 1983; Ropelewski and Halpert 1987). In MAM, large correlations are seen in the central-southern region. In JJA and SON, a positive Niño-3.4 index is associated with decreasing rainfall over central-eastern Australia.\n\nIn DJF, EIO SST anomalies tend to influence rainfall over inland Australia (Fig. 4a, right column), with an increase in EIO SST associated with a decrease in rainfall; the pattern is similar to that associated with Niño-3.4, although the influence (Fig. 4a, left column) is not completely identical. The pattern, which stretches from the central-north to the southeastern inland regions, reappears with strong correlations. However, the influence over NWA is rather weak. If anything, an increase in the EIO SST trend is associated with a decrease in NWA rainfall.\n\nIn the MAM season, the impact of the EIO SST on NWA rainfall tends to be opposite to that in DJF, but is rather weaker, as indicated by lower correlation coefficients. In the JJA and SON seasons (right column, Figs. 4g,h), increasing EIO SST is strongly associated with a rainfall increase in southern Australia (JJA) and parts of NWA (SON). Note that in SON the rainfall correlation pattern with EIO SST strongly resembles that associated with Niño-3.4, but with opposing polarities in the correlation coefficients (Figs. 4d,h).\n\nThus, the significant correlation between NWA rainfall with known modes of global SST variability only occurs in the JJA and SON seasons, when there is little trend in rainfall. In DJF the correlation with either ENSO or IOD is rather weak.\n\nb. Variability of DJF rainfall and Indo-Pacific SSTs\n\nIn this section, we will focus on the DJF rainfall variability. To examine the possibility of a mode of DJF SST variability that dominates the NWA DJF rainfall, we conduct EOF analysis on detrended DJF SST anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean domain over the 1951–2000 period. We perform the analysis over this domain, as opposed to the whole Indo-Pacific region, because we are interested in the teleconnections influencing NWA rainfall through the tropical Indian Ocean. The first mode accounts for 37.2% of the total variance and mainly reflects variations associated with ENSO (Cai et al. 2005a), with warm anomalies occupying almost the entire Indian Ocean basin. The correlation between the associated time series and Niño-3.4 for the SST EOF1 in the tropical Indo-Pacific domain is as high as 0.89. The EOF1 is the well-known basin-scale pattern resulting from an atmospheric teleconnection with the Pacific. For a comparison with the model ENSO in section 4, the anomaly patterns of wind and SST associated with El Niño are plotted in Fig. 5. An El Niño event generates easterly anomalies throughout much of the tropical (10°S–10°N) Indian Ocean (Fig. 5), which superimpose on the climatological westerlies, giving rise to a warming and decreased evaporation. The opposite occurs during La Niña. The correlation between the EOF1 time series and rainfall is fairly similar to that associated with Niño-3.4 (Fig. 4a, left column); the correlation is rather weak over NWA.\n\nThe pattern of EOF2, which accounts for 14.9% of the total variance, depicts positive anomalies extending northwest from the NWA coast into the Indian Ocean. The pattern of correlation coefficients between the time series and Australian rainfall show a general opposite polarity between east and west of 130°E, with the correlations bordering on the 95% statistical significance level. We shall discuss the linkage of EOF2 with NWA rainfall later, when we analyze NWA rainfall EOFs.\n\nThe above results suggest that there is no well-defined SST EOF mode that dominates the NWA DJF rainfall variability, and there is a weak ENSO influence on NWA rainfall. In any case, the trend of ENSO over 1951–2000 is certainly unable to explain the observed DJF rainfall trend, because there is an upward trend in Niño-3.4 over the 50-yr period. According to the ENSO–NWA rainfall relationship shown in Fig. 4a (left column), that is, an increase in rainfall associated with a La Niña pattern, the upward trend in the Niño-3.4 would mean a rainfall reduction rather than an increase. Indeed, removing the influence of ENSO results in an even stronger increasing rainfall trend. For these reasons we will remove ENSO in our subsequent analysis. To this end, we linearly regress DJF rainfall anomalies onto Niño-3.4 and remove the associated anomalies identified.\n\nBecause we are unable to identify entities of SST patterns that are responsible for DJF rainfall variability, and because ENSO is not responsible for the positive trend in NWA rainfall, we remove ENSO signals at all grid points. We conduct EOF analysis on the non-ENSO NWA rainfall anomalies in the domain of 10°–25°S, 110°–135°E. The EOF1 accounts for 47.2% of the total variance, and EOF2 accounts for 12.2% of the total variance (without ENSO). We focus on this limited region rather than Australia as a whole because the trend is concentrated in this area. The pattern persists when we extend the domain to include the eastern half of Australia, highlighting the robustness of the spatial EOF structure.\n\nTo find out the associated pan-Australia pattern, gridpoint rainfall anomalies are regressed onto the associated time series, with the patterns shown in Fig. 6. The EOF1 spatial pattern reflects the northern concentration of variance, with small anomalies south of 28°S. The EOF2 pattern (Fig. 6b) shows coherence between the regions east and west of 130°E, but of opposing polarities; to the east, anomalies are strongest north of 25°S, and to the west anomalies are largest in the area between 18° and 26°S, 112° and 125°E. As will be shown, the increasing rainfall trend over NWA is a result of the upward trends of these two modes: east of 130°E, the weights of EOF1 and EOF2 offset, giving rise to the spatial feature shown in Fig. 2e. (When similar analysis is conducted with the presence of ENSO signals in rainfall, similar patterns emerge, supporting the small impact of ENSO on rainfall in the region. The correlation between the EOF1 time series and Niño-3.4 is 0.28, while between the EOF2 time series and Niño-3.4 the correlation is 0.02, virtually independent from ENSO.)\n\nTo obtain the SST pattern associated with the rainfall EOF without ENSO, we regress gridpoint SST anomalies onto the two EOF time series with the results shown in Fig. 7. The regression pattern for EOF1 (Fig. 7a) is somewhat similar to that associated with Niño-3.4 (Fig. 5), taking into account of opposite signs. The pattern is also similar to that identified by England et al. (2006, their Fig. 5) associated with extreme rainfall events over SWWA, although in the present context we are dealing with all rainfall events. The associated anomalies are not spatially uniform, and they encompass enhanced east–west gradients toward the NWA coast. It is the change of the SST gradient, not the SST per se, that generates NWA rainfall variability. Figure 7a shows that an increased zonal SST gradient toward the NWA coast is conducive to a rainfall increase over northern Australia. The SST pattern associated with EOF2 (Fig. 7b) indicates that warming anomalies west of NWA promote rainfall west of 130°E, but these anomalies are associated with a rainfall reduction east of this longitude.\n\nThe fact that the Indian Ocean SST pattern associated with the rainfall EOF1 without ENSO resembles the pattern associated with ENSO, but has a rather different impact on rainfall (Fig. 4a, left column, versus Fig. 6a), raises two important issues. First, patterns of SST variability independent of, but similar to, ENSO can have a significant influence on NWA rainfall. Second, the influence on rainfall by this pattern is dependent on the equatorial Indo-Pacific SST anomaly structure. In the presence of La Niña (Fig. 4a), the impact is vastly different from that without La Niña (Fig. 6a).\n\nTo further understand the dynamical processes of the two rainfall EOFs, we regress NCEP mean sea level pressure (MSLP), surface winds, and cloud cover anomalies onto the two rainfall EOF time series and plot the results in Figs. 8 and 9. Figure 8a indicates that the rainfall EOF1 is associated with a decreased MSLP bordering the northwest coast, with a cyclonic flow pattern consisting of northwesterlies blowing from the EIO (10°S) toward the NWA coast, with strong northerlies toward northern Australia. These winds pick up the high moisture content from the tropical ocean, leading to an increase in northern Australian rainfall. In association, a pattern of increased cloud cover is seen over NWA (Fig. 9a), which occupies the entire northern Australia region, consistent with the rainfall EOF1 pattern. Note that in this season the climatological mean winds are westerlies; therefore, the northwesterlies blowing from the EIO at 10°S act to enhance the westerlies and evaporation (figure not shown), generating a cooling (Fig. 7a) in the tropical EIO. In this way, increasing rainfall over northern Australia is associated with anomalously low EIO SST. Other large-scale features seen in Fig. 8a include strong southeasterly flows extending from the WA coast into the central southern subtropical Indian Ocean, and the flows are supported by an anomalously high MSLP to the west and near-coast low MSLP. As discussed previously, it is the gradient of SST that is important in moving tropical convection, rather than the absolute value of SST (indeed, there are small anomalies along the NWA coast; see Fig. 7a). The strong southeasterly flows in the subtropical Indian Ocean are conducive to the cooling offshore seen in Fig. 7a, indirectly contributing to the enhancement of zonal SST gradients toward the NWA coast.\n\nThe anomalous circulation associated with the rainfall EOF2, shown in Fig. 8b, is rather different. MSLP tends to be higher over the Australian continent. The associated flow pattern shows that east of 130°E northwesterly flows toward the tropical EIO are generated, and some veer eastward and, as part of an anticyclonic pattern, turn south along the WA coast and pick up moisture over the ocean along the way. These northerlies with high moisture impinge on the NWA coast and contribute to the high rainfall west of the 130°E, whereas over northeastern Australia the flows are generally southwesterly. In this way, rainfall is high west of 130°E, and low to the east. The cloud cover pattern (Fig. 9b) shows an increased cover extending from the subtropical EIO southeastward to 130°E; however, looking east decreased cloud cover is seen over northeastern Australia.\n\nIt will be shown in section 4 that these two rainfall modes and the associated DJF circulation pattern are generally well reproduced by the CSIRO model. However, the model also generates unrealistic circulation modes in this season.\n\nc. The dynamics of the observed DJF rainfall trend\n\nIn this section we focus on the NWA rainfall trend in DJF. We have shown that the trend in ENSO over the past 50 yr is unable to explain the DJF rainfall trend, and that there is no SST mode of variability in this season identifiable by EOF analysis that dominates NWA rainfall variability. Can we understand the rainfall increase in terms of the two rainfall EOFs identified in section 3b? To this end, we project DJF rainfall anomalies onto the EOF1 and EOF2 patterns following the procedure described in section 2. First, for each year, the raw observed DJF rainfall anomaly pattern is linearly regressed onto the DJF rainfall EOF1 pattern in the domain of 10°–25°S, 110°–135°E. This is conducted for 50 yr from 1951 to 2000, and a time series of regression coefficients is generated, which shows an upward trend. Second, the total trend in the time series ∇f (t) is calculated through linear trend analysis. Finally, the trend associated with EOF1 is obtained by multiplying the total trend in the time series ∇f (t) with the EOF1 pattern (Fig. 6a). The result is plotted in Fig. 10a. A similar analysis is conducted for EOF2; the time series again displays an upward trend. The trend resulting from EOF2 is shown in Fig. 10b. The sum of EOF1 and EOF2 (Fig. 10c) produces an amplitude and shape of the trend that compares quite well with the total trend over NWA (Fig. 2e). The amplitude of the trend is larger than that shown in Fig. 2e in some places. Thus, the DJF rainfall increase over NWA can be understood in terms of the upward trend of the two combined EOFs. This combination is important because it generates the shape with a northeast–southwest orientation.\n\nIn the above analysis, we have excluded the trend in ENSO. We now include this by regressing detrended rainfall onto the detrended Niño-3.4 and then multiplying the regression pattern with the trend in the raw Niño-3.4. When this is included, it does not change the overall trend pattern (Fig. 10d), consistent with the fact that the impact of ENSO is small. However, because the ENSO trend over the past 50-yr serves to decrease NWA rainfall, the inclusion of the impact of an ENSO-like pattern further improves the agreement with the total trend (Fig. 2e). In particular, it is the ENSO-like pattern that is principally responsible for the decreasing rainfall trend over the coastal eastern Australia.\n\nA similar approach is used to calculate the trend in SST associated with the two rainfall EOFs. We regress raw SST anomalies onto the SST patterns shown in Fig. 7 for DJF of each year in the domain of 40°S–40°N, 40°–120°E. A time series of the regression coefficients is obtained and the total trend is calculated. The trend maps for EOF1 and EOF2 are similar to those shown in Fig. 7. As in the rainfall trend, the associated SST trend is dominated by that associated with EOF1. The combined SST trend pattern is shown in Fig. 11a, and illustrates a strong zonal SST gradient toward the WA coast.\n\nThis result suggests that over the past 50 yr, ocean warming has projected onto the SST patterns associated with NWA rainfall variability encapsulated in the two rainfall EOFs. This is further illustrated by comparing the total trend obtained through linear regression of the raw SST anomalies (Fig. 11b). A pattern of greater warming along the WA coast, and hence a greater zonal SST gradient toward the WA coast, is evident. This gradient in Fig. 11a reaches about 0.4°C over a 40° longitude distance (80°–120°E) and is comparable to that in the raw data, (a spatially uniform value of 0.35°C is removed in Fig. 11b). Significant warming has occurred north of about 10°S, the dynamics of which is not clear, but in this season, this particular warming does not contribute to a rainfall increase over NWA (Fig. 3a).\n\nSimilarly, we have projected MSLP anomalies on the MSLP patterns shown in Fig. 8. The total trend associated with the two rainfall EOFs is shown in Fig. 11c, which will be compared with the total trend (Fig. 11d). Given that it is the pressure gradient that drives the wind, to facilitate a comparison a uniform value of 1.4 mb is subtracted everywhere. We see that the patterns are very similar, supporting the fact that a climate change signal has been projected onto existing modes of rainfall variability to generate the increasing rainfall trend.\n\nBefore we conclude this section, a brief summary is in order. We have shown that in DJF there is no known SST variability mode that dominates the observed positive trend in NWA rainfall. Further, the El Niño–like trend pattern over the past 50 yr acts to reduce NWA rainfall, therefore it is unable to explain the observed increase. Instead, we find that the rainfall increase is attributable to an intensification in SST gradients toward the coast, west of 130°E. In what ensues, we examine the CSIRO climate model experiments described by Rotstayn et al. (2007) to see if the same process is responsible for an increase in NWA rainfall.\n\nb. Seasonal correlation between NWA rainfall and global SST\n\nFigure 13 shows maps of correlations between the model NWA rainfall and gridpoint SST anomalies as in the observations (cf. Fig. 3 for that observed). For the DJF season (Fig. 13a), the correlation pattern in the Pacific displays a model La Niña–like pattern. Unlike the observations, most of the correlation coefficients have an absolute value greater than 0.12, a threshold that is required for a 95% level of statistical significance. In particular, the correlation with the eastern Pacific is rather high, generally greater than 0.4. The high correlation suggests that the model NWA rainfall is overinfluenced by the model ENSO, a feature that is rather unrealistic. As will be discussed, this is a consequence of the cold-tongue problem, which extends into the equatorial EIO, where the correlation pattern shows a negative phase of an IOD-like pattern. The warm anomalies in the EIO then contribute to an anomalously high rainfall over NWA. Such an IOD-like pattern in DJF is absent in the observations (Fig. 3a).\n\nThe correlation pattern for MAM (Fig. 13b) shows a similar pattern to that in DJF. Again, the correlations with SST in the equatorial Pacific and the EIO are unrealistically too strong. In the JJA and SON seasons (Figs. 13c,d), the correlation patterns in the Indian Ocean resemble those observed and reflect basically the IOD-like variation pattern.\n\nOverall, there are several major differences between the model and the observations. First, in the observations, the IOD pattern only appears in JJA and SON, whereas in the model, an IOD pattern appears to operate in all seasons. Second, in DJF the observed NWA rainfall shows a weak correlation with ENSO, whereas in the model, correlation with ENSO is far greater. Finally, in SON, the correlation of NWA rainfall with equatorial Pacific SST is weaker than that observed.\n\nThe model IOD-like variability pattern in DJF and MAM (Figs. 13a,b) is rather unrealistic. In reality, development of the IOD (with cold anomalies off the Sumatra–Java coast) occurs only in JJA and SON (Rao et al. 2002). Because the climatological mean winds in the EIO are easterly south of the equator during JJA, the thermocline is located at a shallower depth. El Niño–induced easterlies act to increase the wind speed and the latent and sensible heat fluxes. Increased upwelling and stronger latent and sensible heat fluxes overcome the increased shortwave radiation associated with reduced rainfall, leading to the development of a cold pool. The demise of the IOD typically occurs in December after the Australian summer monsoon commences, when the mean winds become westerly in the equatorial EIO and the thermocline is deepened so that there is little thermocline–SST coupling. The induced easterly anomalies then act to reduce the wind speed. The reduced latent heat flux and increased surface shortwave radiation act together to warm the Indian Ocean, yielding a basin-scale warm anomaly (e.g., Klein et al. 1999).\n\nIt is beyond the scope of the present study to fully explore the dynamics of the IOD in this model. However, it is apparent that the IOD-like variability pattern is a consequence of the model cold tongue that extends too far west and, in this version of the model, into the Sumatra–Java coast. As a result, the Sumatra–Java coast constitutes a part of the western Pacific warm pool. Consequently, the climatological mean center of convection is also situated too far west. This center moves eastward and westward with the model ENSO cycle. This is why the ENSO–Australian rainfall teleconnection has the strongest impact in NWA, but not eastern Australia, in the model (Fig. 13a); this is also why the IOD-like pattern in the Indian Ocean is strongest in DJF. Westward from the warm pool, easterlies superimpose on climatological westerlies to generate general warming as in the observations. Further, as will be discussed, there is also a part of the east–west movement of the warm pool that occurs independent of ENSO, and this is reflected in a mode of IOD-like variability after removing the ENSO signals. The main point is that this unrealistic cold-tongue structure creates a spurious relationship between SST in the EIO and NWA in DJF, in which an EIO SST increase is associated with an increase in NWA rainfall, a relationship not seen in the observations.\n\ne. The dynamics of DJF model rainfall trend in the presence of increasing aerosols\n\nHow much of the model DJF rainfall increase is attributable to trends in the DJF rainfall modes (Figs. 16a,b) and to an ENSO-like warming pattern (Fig. 15)? To this end, we project raw DJF rainfall outputs from the ALL ensemble onto the two EOF patterns for each year from 1951 to 2000. A time series of pattern regressions for each mode is obtained and the trend is calculated. Multiplying the total trend in the time series with the EOF patterns gives the trend associated with EOF1 and EOF2. We find that there is little trend embedded in the two EOFs; their sum accounts for less than 10% of the total trend.\n\nSimilarly, we project SST outputs from the ALL ensemble onto the model ENSO pattern (Fig. 15a) to obtain a time series of pattern regression coefficients, from which the total trend is obtained. Separately, we regress the control DJF rainfall onto the control Niño-3.4 to obtain a regression pattern, which describes how rainfall varies with ENSO. The pattern is similar to that shown in Fig. 12a. Multiplying the total trend in the time series with the regression pattern gives the trend map associated with ENSO. We find that the increasing rainfall trend in this set of experiments is not associated with an ENSO-like trend pattern.\n\nMost of the rainfall trend is attributable to the unrealistic teleconnection of NWA rainfall with the EIO SST in this season, embedded in the control run, as shown in Fig. 14e. Regressing gridpoint DJF rainfall anomalies onto the time series of DJF SST in the EIO (5°–15°S, 90°–110°E) in the control run yields a regression pattern map G(x, y)control, which is similar to that shown in Fig. 14e describing the relationship between Australian rainfall and the EIO SST. In the presence of the aerosol forcing, there is an increase in the EIO SST incorporated in an IOD-like trend pattern (Fig. 20a). There are indeed increased SST gradients toward WA, but they are weaker than those observed. More importantly, the pattern is overwhelmed by the large increase in SST off the Sumatra–Java coast. The trend of a time series of DJF SST over the EIO box in the ALL ensemble ∇f (t)All is calculated. Multiplying ∇f (t)All with the regression pattern G(x, y)control generates a total trend that is due to the unrealistic model relationship of EIO SST with Australian rainfall (Fig. 20b). Comparing this with Fig. 12e, we see good agreement, verifying that most of the DJF increasing rainfall trend in the ALL ensemble is caused by the unrealistic teleconnection in the model.\n\nThe process that leads to the increase in the EIO SST has been explored in Rotstayn et al. (2007). In brief, the north–south thermal gradient (cooler in the NH) causes changes in the surface winds, which tend to flow from the cooler equatorial to the southern tropical regions; however, they are deflected to the left such that along the Sumatra–Java coast a trend of northwesterlies is generated, depressing the thermocline and generating the warming, and is accompanied by an increasing rainfall trend over the EIO, extending into NWA."
