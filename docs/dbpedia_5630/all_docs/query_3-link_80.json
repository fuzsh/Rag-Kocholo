        "text": "Watching N.W.A. perform live is an absolutely killer experience. Obviously, you need to understand what you are getting into. If you are offended by their lyrics or profanity, this is probably not the concert for you.\n\nObviously they are one of the greatest rap groups of all time, and a live performance is the top of the heap. The stage was dark and multi-tiered. They had a top tier where there were dancing girls in pink outfits dancing. On the main part of the lower stage they would run back and forth and jump up on platforms on the left and right at certain parts of songs.Dr. Dre and MC Ren came out first and did a couple of songs, but in my opinion that was just warming up the audience. Obviously, Dre is the king, but the performance wasn't amazing.\n\nThe main highlight of the show was Straight Outta Compton and Fuck the Police. When Ice Cube and Eazy-E collaborate on the second song, it blows my mind. I feel the anger and the hatred. Most people consider this gangster rap, and really they invented the genre, but I can't help but feel it's more about the world they live and the world they are from. It's more powerful when you break it into human terms instead of just labels. When they perform the last two songs, the crowd is about as hyped as they can be and everyone is jumping and screaming. I loved every second of it.\n\nRead more"
