        "text": "How Jason Mitchell went from unknown actor to Eazy-E in 'Straight Outta Compton'\n\nBy Mark Olsen\n\nAugust 18, 2015 - LA Times\n\nAs audiences were leaving \"Straight Outta Compton\" on its $60.2-million opening weekend, many were asking about the unknown actor playing N.W.A member Eric \"Eazy-E\" Wright. In scene after scene, the rise, fall and eventual death of Eazy-E provides the film with an emotional core, as his street-hustler smarts and showman's acumen help guide the group to dazzling heights.\n\nThough it's not the first film role for 28-year-old Jason Mitchell, it is by far his biggest. Raised in New Orleans, he started acting only some five years ago, but Mitchell notes with pride that his very first time on a film set, for the dramatic thriller \"Texas Killing Fields,\" he had a speaking part.\n\n\"I figured it would have a different type of people than what I was used to,\" he says of his decision to turn to acting. \"I just wanted to see if I could find my own therapy. I didn't think talking to somebody about my problems and me paying you for that is going to bring me any less stress. I just wanted to do something I felt was expressive.\"\n\nMitchell's mother had a career in the Army, and so the early part of his life was spent tagging along with her and his siblings as they moved about the globe. It was around middle school that the family settled in New Orleans, where his mother had been raised. Then, around the time he was graduating high school, Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. \"We lost everything pretty much,\" he says. \"We had to start over.\"\n\nFor him that meant a series of jobs, including cook, electrician and oyster shucker. But also, \"I used to hustle on the side. I was also in the drug scene,\" Mitchell says. \"And I started seeing a lot of things happen, things that were too close to home, and I thought that's not really what I want for myself. My best friend was killed in 2007, and that's where I started thinking, 'I'm just going to find something different to do.' And it took me a little while, but then I found acting school.\"\n\nAll five members of N.W.A are cast with unknowns. (O'Shea Jackson Jr. is the son of N.W.A member Ice Cube but makes his acting debut in the film.) \"Straight Outta Compton\" director F. Gary Gray explained in a recent episode of the podcast \"The Call-In,\" hosted by \"Selma\" director Ava DuVernay, about the thinking behind his decision to cast unknown actors in the film's key roles.\n\n\"I was very deliberate in my approach to casting the movie,\" Gray said. \"It all but demanded that it had to be new faces. The N.W.A story is way too powerful to be distracted by some celebrity emulating or pretending to be another celebrity.\"\n\nFrom the moment he first learned of the role, Mitchell began preparing, immediately convinced of the potential scale of the role both for his career as an actor and for himself.\n\n\"It felt like I could really show all my creative guns,\" he said. \"I have a huge character arc. I got to go from a drug dealer to an icon who gets to go to the White House to dying of AIDS. It's a huge, huge situation. Before I ever found out the magnitude, that it's a Universal project, and F. Gary Gray was involved, I didn't know all of those details, I just looked at Eazy-E and N.W.A as this could be potentially my ticket to change my life. And that was my fire.\"\n\nWhen it came time to audition, Mitchell said he went all out for the role.\n\n\"I brought the rain,\" he says. \"I cried hard in my first audition.\"\n\nMitchell was a fan of Eazy-E, N.W.A and Ice Cube before the project came about, though he admits he was first a fan of the group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, who recorded on Eazy-E's Ruthless Records label. Mitchell is also similar in size to the 5-foot, 5-inch Eazy-E, not that it had ever come up before.\n\n\"I'd never had any Eazy-E comparisons before this,\" the actor says. \"Now it's like, 'You're exactly like him.' Which is crazy, right?\"\n\nDespite their similarities, Mitchell had to put on weight, work on a South Los Angeles accent and learn to rap along with the rest of the actors playing N.W.A. He met with Eazy-E's daughter and son, as well as his widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, also an executive producer on the film.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Wright, and the film's final section is largely handed over to his declining health and death. Wright died in March 1995, only one month after being diagnosed with AIDS, and Mitchell's hospital room deathbed scenes are the most emotional scenes in the film.\n\nFilming the scenes proved emotional for Mitchell too. \"It was very therapeutic,\" he says.\n\n\"I would advise anybody who doesn't cry on the regular to get it out. It felt good. Afterward people were crying, the air was really thick that day. And I just remember having a huge smile on my face. Everybody asked, 'How can you be smiling?' And I just felt so relieved. It was a place where I wasn't even acting anymore. I just fell into it.\"\n\nMitchell has already shot roles in two other films, \"Vincent-N-Roxxy\" with Emile Hirsch and Zoe Kravitz, and \"Keanu,\" the Peter Atencio-directed film with Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, and was feeling a career boost from \"Compton\" even before its big opening weekend.\n\nHe is also quick to acknowledge that his turn in \"Straight Outta Compton\" could still wind up the high point of his career and could also be a crucial part of cementing the memory and legacy of Eric \"Eazy-E\" Wright.\n\n\"I don't know how people feel when they read about Ponce de Leon or whatever person they read about in history,\" Mitchell says. \"I do know that 100 years from now, I would like to be judged by this and would like people to remember me by this. I want to be one of those people written about in history, but to be written in history as a historian is totally different. That's the opportunity with this.\"\n\nThen, bringing up his neighborhood in New Orleans, he adds, \"Hollywood to historian from Hollygrove. Who would have ever thought?\"\n\nby Brandon Perry, August 14, 2015\n\nWith today’s nationwide release of the NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, Hopes&Fears wondered why Hollywood execs left influential girl group J.J. Fad out of the picture. J.J. Fad’s seminal NWA-produced album Supersonic paved the way for their male counterparts by offering a poppy alternative to the gangster rap NWA would become known for, and - by hitting #33 on the Billboard Charts - legitimized Ruthless Records with a commercially successful album, enabling Straight Outta Compton to become the hit we know it as today.\n\nWe spoke with J.J. Fad’s Juana Burns about being left out of history, her group’s legacy, and who she would want to play her if they ever made a J.J. Fad biopic.\n\nHopes&Fears: People have been asking me if I’m excited to see Straight Outta Compton and the first thing I said is that I really hope they touch on J. J. Fad’s role in the album. How did you see your role in the whole thing?\n\nJuana Burns: I just wish that they would have put in a line like, “Hey let me finish up with J. J. Fad in the studio. Eazy, I’ll be right with you.” And then, they could have put a little “Supersonic” in the background, so that the history would have been told the right way. If I wasn’t sitting here telling you this, you would never know. The average person would never know how integral we were, and how pivotal we were to the whole NWA story.\n\nH&F: I feel like I know it by listening to those records.\n\nJB: Exactly.\n\nH&F: I don’t know if people in middle America watching the movie for the first time are going to know. Hopefully, this will let them know.\n\nJB: Absolutely, absolutely. I wouldn’t diss the movie at all because I heard the movie was absolutely amazing. I’m super excited. I cannot wait to see it. But I know people are [going to mention our absence] and say, “It was for time’s sake.” Well no, it takes two seconds to say something. Two seconds. Just say the name of the group so that people know that it was actually a part of the history.\n\nH&F: In Jerry Heller’s book he even says that he and Eazy actually put your record out first, on purpose. Is that how you remember it?\n\nJB: Yeah, they did it strategically because they knew with them being so rough and hard that they needed to legitimize the label by putting us out first, letting us take off first [to] legitimize the label. Then after that, NWA just chopped the door down, but we definitely opened the doors for them to come out. They did it on purpose.\n\nH&F: Is this why there’s a pop side and a hip-hop side on Supersonic? How was that determined?\n\nJB: Yeah, Dre [produced] the album [with songs that] sounded poppy and [others that] sounded more like hardcore hip-hop. [That] was the way [we] decided to split up the songs.\n\nH&F: Your first single, “Another Hoe,” was a diss track, but that was eventually dropped off of the full length. Was that your guys’ choice?\n\nJB: During that time, there were all these big rap beefs going on with L.L. Cool J., Kool Moe Dee, EPMD, Rakim, all kinds of stuff. We [thought], “You know what, this is probably a way for us to get our foot in the door.” That’s why we did this record. We had no beef with any of the females. We just thought that that was the way to do it. But [afterward], we were shopping the song around and giving it to DJs, and people start flipping the record over. They were like, “This is the cut right here.” So we said we need to go back in the studio, drop the diss record even though it did come out and make Supersonic. Eventually, that’s what we did [and it] paid off big time.\n\nH&F: So you put out Supersonic and then the NWA record came out later, it was so hard. A lot of the imagery they were using was very violent and also kind of misogynistic, were you ever conflicted about that?\n\nJB: No, not at all. They were them and we were us, you know what I mean? We were a softer version and I think it’s so clever of Dre to pick up [on] people’s strengths and weaknesses. Our strength was a more pop appeal and dancy electric energy. We had more fun. They were more hardcore, so I think he’s really a genius at knowing the artist and knowing what suits them best.\n\nH&F: Can you talk a little about your collaboration on “We’re All in the Same Gang”? It was a great record that I loved growing up to in LA.\n\nJB: Yes. I absolutely loved that song. That was one of the most fun projects that we ever did. It was amazing how we all came together and it was a team effort. It was a super fun day shooting the video. The whole feel of it was great. Michael Concepcion, who was a hardcore gang member at the time, was the one who came up with the idea to do that song, to bring peace to the Bloods and the Crips. I think it was done legitimately to bring peace because the city in was in an uproar. I think the best way [to bring peace to a situation is] through music. So many people were fans of NWA, M.C. Hammer, just all of it. They were fans of all the West Coast rap. That’s when the West Coast was coming on really strong in the rap community.\n\nH&F: Do you think anything similar would ever happen now? In the current climate there’s still a lot of unrest and a lot should happen, but I don’t [fore]see the same thing happening now as to what was happening with, “We’re All in the Same Gang,” or “Self Destruction”.\n\nJB: Right, I think there should be. I would definitely be a champion for that effort. We should come together. Especially after the Tupac - Biggie saga.\n\nH&F: If it were up to me, I’d want a J. J. Fad biopic too. So if there was a J. J. Fad biopic, who’d portray you in the movie?\n\nJB: Oh my goodness, that’s a great question. I’m the tallest one, so let me think of somebody pretty tall. Maybe um, what’s her name? The girl that played Monica in Love and Basketball. Sanaa Lathan.\n\nH&F: What have you been listening to lately?\n\nJB: I’m a huge, huge Kendrick Lamar fan. Totally love his stuff. I love Eminem too because he paid homage to us in his song, “Rap God.”\n\nH&F: I loved that track.\n\nJB: I’m a fan for life. Right now, those are the two acts who I really enjoy the most.\n\nH&F: I know there were some things going on with the Fergie sample. Did anything ever come out after that? It seemed like such a straight rip of your song.\n\nJB: We can definitely touch base on that because I think that there’s a big misunderstanding about that. She asked our permission to do that. We got paid for it. That was one of our biggest paydays since Supersonic came out. There are no hard feelings. We talked to her on the phone and the whole reason she did that was because she was a huge fan. She says to this day she has our picture on her office wall. It was actually a compliment. It was very flattering that she did that. A lot of people don’t know [the facts] and that’s why we had a lot of Twitter chatter about, “Oh, she’s a rip-off.” It was nothing like that. She totally asked permission.\n\nH&F: Totally off tangent, but a few people I know consider CB4 to be the first NWA biopic. How do you feel about that?\n\nJB: I can’t really speak on it, I didn’t see it at all. I heard about it, but I haven’t seen that movie."
