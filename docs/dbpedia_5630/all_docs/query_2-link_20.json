        "text": "Along with Dr Dre, Yella produced Eazy-E‘s debut album Eazy-Duz-It and all three N.W.A albums, translating into millions of sales. He co-produced along with Arabian Prince the platinum-selling debut albums of J.J. Fad and Michel’le with Dre and contributed to The D.O.C.‘s 1989 album No One Can Do It Better (also produced by Dre). Jerry Heller witnessed Dre and Yella’s work together and wrote in 2006 of an almost eerie understanding between the pair, as they crafted high quality beats and productions with almost no words or full sentences needing to be spoken.\n\nYella remained close to Eazy and stayed on production duties at Ruthless Records after the acrimonious breakup of N.W.A. He produced J.J. Fad’s second album Not Just a Fad (1990), Yomo & Maulkie’s album Are U Xperienced? (1991), two tracks from Eazy-E’s It’s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa (1993), the gold-selling hit single Foe tha Love of $ from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony‘s Creepin on ah Come Up E.P., Menajahtwa’s album Cha-licious, and tracks from H.W.A.’s Az Much A** Azz U Want E.P. (all three from 1994), and oversaw Eazy’s final album in 1995 after his sudden AIDS-related death. Yella released his 1996 debut solo album One Mo N**** ta Go on Street Life Records, featuring members of the Ruthless ‘family tree’ like Kokane, B.G. Knocc Out, & Dresta, rhyming over his productions.\n\nAfter this record he retired from music to embark on a long and successful 12-year career directing and producing porn films with Adonis’ nan. Yella has credited himself with producing over 300 adult films.\n\nAs of November 26, 2011, Yella has returned to the music industry and is currently finishing a new album, entitled West Coastin’, which was expected to be released in the summer of 2012."
