As a founding member of N.W.A. (with Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella), Arabian Prince participated in the birth of the gangsta rap genre and cut electro classics like ‘Something 2 Dance 2‘, ‘Panic Zone‘ and ‘Dope Man’, plus their first single the title track to the movie Boyz-N-The-Hood and one of the “top 50 greatest albums of all time” (according to Rolling Stone and Billboard magazine), Straight Outta Compton. He left the group after the release of that record due manager Jerry Heller’s “creative accounting” that left the group out of pocket.\n\nAs a producer he cut the classic ‘Supersonic‘ for JJ Fad (that was reworked by Fergie in 2006) and a slew of other hits on Dream Team Records and Macola. As Professor X he extends his electro legacy with 12s ‘Saga’ and ‘Statix’ on iconic labels like Techno Kut, Street Dance and more recently Clone. As a solo artist he has released albums such as Brother Arab and Situation Hot, plus the Stone’s Throw anthology of last year Innovative Life.\n\nArabian Prince is back in 09 – or perhaps he never went away – with a live DJ/MC throwdown that covers his electro rap catalogue with a nod to the past, present and future.\n\nSupport: Def Wish Cast, James Dela Cruz (Ex-Avalanches), Stolen Records, tha Fizz, Cassette, Typhonic.\n\nLinks & Media:\n\nPropellerheads Interview 2007\n\nRed Bull Music Academy Session\n\nInfo @ Onthefly.com.au\n\nArabian Prince @ Westcoastpioneers.com\n\nArabian Prince @ Myspace\n\nTickets: Discounted @ Moshtix with ‘COMPTON’ code\n\nFacebook Event Link"
