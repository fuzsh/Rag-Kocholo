        "text": "If you’ve watched the 65th annual Grammy Awards last night, then you witnessed the epic tribute dedicated to Hip-Hop to celebrate its 50th anniversary.\n\nRappers such as Queen Latifah, LL Cool J, Nelly, Salt & Peppa, Run DMC, Glorilla, Lil Baby, and more were all a part of the star-studded performance, but one supergroup was not, which was J.J. Fad.\n\nThe group went on Instagram to slam the Recording Academy for excluding them from the tribute, although they were the first female rap group to be nominated for a Grammy when the rap category was created.\n\nIn the caption of the post, they wrote, “So when the @recordingacademy Grammy’s first introduced the rap category in 1988, we were the first to be nominated in that category. Now there’s a celebration of the 50th anniversary of hip hop at the Grammy’s and we aren’t invited?? Make it make sense!!”\n\nDuring a recent interview, they went on to say, “We just want the same respect as all of our Hip-hop brothers and sisters that made a difference in Hip-Hop.” They added, “We attended the Grammys when we were nominated along with Kool Moe Dee who should also be there representing Hip-Hop. We hate to sound whiny and we aren’t hating on anyone, we just want to be there with our Hip-Hop brothers and sisters and be honored for our contributions to Hip-Hop as well.”\n\nJ.J. Fad added another post congratulating everyone who appeared during the hip-hop tribute at the Grammys.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this?"
