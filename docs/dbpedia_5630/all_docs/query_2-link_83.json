        "text": "Chapter 3:\n\nArtists and people connected to Ruthless\n\n(thanxxx to Ste7 for many underground pics, to Warrior from whose tight NWA page i stole the Tomica pics...)\n\nAbove the Law\n\nATL consist nowadays of Cold 187um (producer and MC), KMG (MC) and DJ K-Oss. In former times also Go-Mack was a member of ATL. Besides their early lyrical massacre and gangsterism this group shines with its fresh, outstanding production which included the discovering of g-funk. ATL started back in the late 80's after Ike Turner gave them some keyboards. In 1990 ATL released their masterpiece debut \"livin like hustlers\" which is still a classic. They added a lot of political content to their gangsta rap verses and continued in their way the spirit of NWA. In 1994 they released their last album on Ruthless, called \"uncle sams curse\". It featured one of their best songs, \"black superman\". ATL still worked together in 1996 with MC Ren, Cold 187um's production made Ren's album become a classic. Cuz ATL never sold gold or even platinum status they are kinda the Kings of Underground. After some time on Tommy Boy they are currently signed to Death Row.\n\nalso check out:\n\n\"best of\"-mixtape section with ATL's 20 best songs.\n\nArabian Prince\n\nWhen NWA was founded Arabian Prince was a member. However he dropped before \"straight outta compton\" was released. He still worked together with NWA and produced tracks for e.g. Michelle. He continued his career as rapper/producer but never became really well-known.\n\nAtban Klan\n\nToday: Black Eyed Peas. Actually they should release an album in around 1993. But then Eazy signed Bone Thugs n Harmony and pushed them. The Klan dropped from Ruthless after Eazy died.\n\nB.G. Knocc Out\n\nTho BG was never signed to Ruthless he was one of Eazy's most loyal affiliates together with his homey Gangsta Dresta. He supported Eazy lyrically on \"real muthaphuccin g'z\" and released together with Dresta the album \"real brothas\" in 1995. After that it remained silent around Knocc Out. He made a few guest appearances but stayed in the underground.\n\nBig Chan\n\nBig Chan is a female underground MC from L.A. She was featured on DJ Uneek's solo debut \"ghetto pharmacist\". She never released an album on Ruthless. She dropped from Ruthless and is currently signed to Death Row.\n\nBig Jess\n\nProducer for Ren. if you got additional info let me know.\n\nBizzy Bone\n\nsigned to Ruthless\n\nOne MC from Bone Thugs n Harmony. He was the first Bone to release a solo album. He dissed Tomica Wright on that record. For many rap fans he got the best style with his tongue runnin fast like a flash over the beat. he is a great MC.\n\nBlood of Abraham\n\nAn underground group that was signed to Ruthless. If anyone has info bout them let me know.\n\nBobcat\n\nBobcat is one of the best and one of the most underrated producers in the rap game. Before NWA started this cat already made tight beats. Tho he was never signed to Ruthless he made some dope production for Ren and Eazy after NWA's departure.\n\nBone Thugs N Harmony\n\nstill signed to Ruthless\n\nleft to right: Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie\n\nBone are besides NWA the most famous group ever signed to Ruthless. These 4 youngsters (Krayzie, Bizzy, Layzie and Wish) are originally from Cleveland, Ohio. In 1993 they spent their whole money to come to L.A. They called Eazy-E and E was in a good mood, so he listened to them. Krayzie rapped a few verses on the phone and Eazy was impressed. He invited Bone and started working with them. That made many other Ruthless artists jealous. Bone revolutionized the whole rap world by using their \"midwest\" style. A melodious and fast rapping style. Bone perfected these skills by using a lot of singing and by dropping rap verses from different rappers over each other. Where many other MCs' skills stop, the versatile lyrical abilities of Bone start. Their style was copied several times but lyrically they juss can't be touched. Bone are the most commercial act signed to Ruthless and released several multi-platinum LP's and the big selling single, \"crossroads\", which is dedicated to Eazy-E. They weren't pushed enuff by Tomica, Eazy's widow, juss in 1999 Bone first talked to Tomica after years of label-intern hate. Probably Bone will leave Ruthless Records soon.\n\nCold 187um\n\nBig Hutch aka Cold 187um is the mastermind of Above the Law, a remarkable MC and a dope as hell producer. When Ike Turner gave his crew ATL some old keyboards they started making music. In this way Cold 187um invented the g-funk. This kind of rap music was the main style in the early 90's. Dr. Dre \"stole\" it from Ruthless and made this style world-known with records like \"chronic\" and Snoop's \"doggystyle\". Cold 187um is one of the most underrated producers in the rap game and one of the most gifted ones. Even after he left Ruthless he kept on working for Ren. Currently he and his crew ATL are signed to Death Row.\n\nDirty Red\n\nUnderground MC that rapped together with Eazy.\n\nDJ K-oss\n\nATL's DJ behind the turntables.\n\nDJ Train (RIP)\n\nDJ Train was a tight producer since the NWA days and one of Ren's closest friends. he died back in around 94, Ren still dedicates his albums to him.\n\nDJ U-Neek\n\nDJ U-neek got to know Eazy-E in the early 90's. When E discovered Bone Thugs n Harmony he let Uneek do some of the production for their first EP. Uneek did so excellent work that he continued his work for Bone till today. He did all of the production for \"eternal 99\" and \"art of war\", both multi-platinum albums but also outstanding albums. Instead of the usual commercial covering of 70's hits and using a bunch of chart guest appearances Uneek showed the world how a maestro produces excellent rap music. The mastermind behind Bone isn't the average producer, he composes music. Opulent production by using unusual instruments like flutes and horns over dark piano melodies and heavy bass-patterns make Uneek's production-style way better than 90% of rap's producers. Tho he worked also with other remarkable MC's including Mack 10 and Gangsta Dresta it is upon Bone to shine on his beats.\n\nDJ Yella\n\nDJ Yella is the most underrated member of the NWA crew. He had started together with Dre in the World Class Wreckin Cru but had always stayed behind Dre. When E died in 95 he released an album totally dedicated to his dead homey. But \"one ma nigga ta go\" only sold 20,000 copies so Yella stopped the music business. But the few things he produced after the departure of NWA, e.g. for Eazy and Bone, were all good. Yella currently makes pornos. Hopefully Yella starts working again in the music scene soon.\n\nDr. Jam\n\nThis producer is one of the main producer of MC Ren and did also some remarkable production for tha E. Most if not all times he produced together with Madness 4 Real. His dark, wicked version of g-funk is the perfect musical background for Ren's evil lyrics.\n\nDr. Dre\n\nTho Dre was never signed to Ruthless he revolutionized the production in rap music. After he started in the World Class Wreckin Cru he did together with Yella all the tight production behind NWA! His production skills are on a really high level, he is no doubt one of the best producers ever! Cuz of financial problems he left Ruthless and founded its strongest concurrent, Death Row. he made death row big with his famous \"chronic\" and the beats behind Snoop on \"doggystyle\". But Eazy and Cold 187um sued him for using g-funk. So Dre had to pay money to Eazy for each record he sold. Dre had beef with Eazy but later he visited his former enemy at the death bed. When the hate even on his own label grew Dre left the Row and founded his next label Aftermath. Currently he is working on the new NWA record. many people think of Dre as a commercial musician but except the g-funk story he never did commercial music. He did his own thang but many people love it! I pay Dre dues for his inventions in music and for really dope music.\n\nDru Down\n\nstill signed to Ruthless\n\nDru Down is a well-known rapper from the bay area. He signed to Ruthless in 99 and is currently the only well-known artist besides Bone. When Bone leave it is up on him to carry on the name of Ruthless.\n\nEazy-E (RIP)\n\nEazy-E is the Godfather of Gangsta Rap, the one who started this shit. Cuz of his former criminal lifestyle Eazy had the knowledge bout street life. He founded Ruthless Records and helped many artists to come out. Without Eazy-E and his idea to start NWA the whole rap scene wouldn't be the same. Thatz why you should pay him his dues - for being the first to speak the real.\n\nfor additional information check out March article\n\nFlesh-n-Bone\n\nThe 5th Bone, he was never signed to Ruthless but worked a lot with his homeys Bone Thugs n Harmony.\n\nForbidden\n\nstill signed to Ruthless\n\nI never heard a song by these cats. Seem to be r&b. If you have any more information let me know.\n\nFrost\n\nBack in the day there weren't many latino rappers out. You got the Funky Aztecs puttin it down for the Bay Area and Cypress Hill puttin it down for L.A. Frost came out hard, it was the Ruthless style but in Latin fashion. Frost released some tight albums on Ruthless but left the label after Eazy's death.\n\nGangsta Dresta\n\nA G from Compton, together with BG Knocc Out he supported EAzy-E lyrically on \"real muthaphuccin g'z\". Dresta was never signed to Ruthless but tho has been one of E's truest affiliates. In 1995 he released \"real brothas\" together with BG Knocc Out. Unlike his podna Dresta continued his rap career on good-selling records such as DJ Uneek's \"ghetto street pharmacist\" or on the NWA tribute album.\n\nGo-Mack\n\nOne member of ATL. He left the group in the early 90's.\n\nIce Cube\n\nCube is one of the most important figures in the rap game. He started in 10th grade of school with K-Dee in a group called CIA, some of the beats by Dre. Tho he was never signed to Ruthless he wrote a lot of Eazy's early songs including \"8 ball\" and \"boyz n tha hood\". In the NWA crew he was known for his humor that wasn't lying bout the truth, e.g. \"a bitch iz a bitch\". Cube became a member of the NWA crew which started his big career. In 1989 he departed from NWA and started his solo career. His work includes important albums like \"amerikas most wanted\" and \"lethal injection\". Since his movie debut in \"boys n tha hood\" he has played in many hollywood movies which made some rap artists hate on him.\n\nHWA\n\nHWA means \"Hoes with Attitude\", the female opposite to \"Niggaz with Attitude\". They never reached the status of NWA, they were far away from it. HWA released some ish in around 1990.\n\nJJ Fad\n\nJJ Fad were a good-selling rap/r&b group consisting of young females. Their 89 album \"supersonic\" even went platinum. Dr. Dre did a lot of the production for them.\n\nJerry Heller\n\nJerry Heller was Eazy's manager. Cuz he and Eazy seemed to cheat on many Ruthless artists these acts left ruthless and went with Dre to Death Row. Jerry Heller was white, so Dre made fun of Eazy who trusted a white man and even had financial business with him. I have no clue if heller still works for Ruthless.\n\nJ-Rocc\n\nthis underground MC worked with Ren. if you got additional info let me know.\n\nJuvenile\n\nNot the Juvey from Cash Money. this is MC Ren's brother, an underground MC.\n\nKMG\n\nThe MC from Above the Law and one of the most underrated MC's in the rap game.\n\nKokane\n\nKokane (right) and Ren\n\nKokane is an OG in the L.A. rap game. He worked a lot together with the Ruthless camp including espicially Above the Law. he also worked with Yella on the song \"4 tha e\". In 98 he released his latest album, a dope 10-cut record that was overlooked by too many.\n\nKrayzie Bone\n\nSigned to Ruthless\n\nThe bizziest Bone. He released his solo album in form of a double LP in 99. He got the deepest voice of all Bone members and incredible rap skills.\n\nLayzie Bone\n\nSigned to Ruthless\n\nThe youngest member of the Bone formation. he recently released the 3rd Mo Thug compilation.\n\nL.T. Hutton\n\nHutton did some tight production for Eazy-E, Bone and MC Ren. He is a remarkable beatmaker who worked for many different artists.\n\nMadness 4 Real\n\nThis producer is one of the main producer of MC Ren and did also some remarkable production for tha E. Most if not all times he produced together with Dr. Jam. His dark, wicked version of g-funk is the perfect musical background for Ren's evil lyrics.\n\nMC Ren\n\nAfter EAzy's death, when many artists left Ruthless, Ren was the last MC from day 1 that was still on Ruthless. He never lost his attitude he earned in the old NWA days. Tho he got some stress with E in 93 he paid his mentor respect, musically e.g. on the song \"ruthless 4 life\". For much more information go to the August article \"underrated lyricists pt.1\".\n\nMenajahtwa\n\nUnderground MC that was signed to Ruthless. If you got any information let me know.\n\nMichel'le\n\nMichelle did some commercial r&b in the end of the 80's that was produced by Dre. Later she married Dre and went to Death Row. She is still signed to the Row and rumors say she's going to marry Suge Knight.\n\nNaughty by Nature\n\nThis well-known group outta NY that brought you \"hip hop hooray\" worked also with Eazy.\n\nNWA - Niggaz with Attitude\n\nTho at the time NWA started some other tight artists were out there it was on Eazy and NWA to talk bout street life, guns and trouble with cops in such a direct way, opening the door for many other rap artists and opening the mind of suburbians for the problems and the situation in the projects. The group was trying to be banned from radio stations and the FBI but their debut \"straight outta compton\" sold over 2 million copies in juss 6 weeks. Songs like \"fuck tha police\" and \"straight outta compton\" laid the way for gangsta rap, telling it how it is. On other songs the crew proved for every artist their dope skills. Both lyrically and musically NWA couldn't be touched. The formation which consisted of Eazy-E, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, is probably the most influencable group in the whole history of rap music!\n\nThe group departed in 1991. Now in 1999 the group formed again, without Eazy-E (of course), but now with Snoop. Since 2000 also Yella is again down with NWA. We will see what the reunion will bring.\n\nPistol\n\nPistol is the best-known artist outta Nashville, Tennessee. He came out a short time after Memphis collegue Gangsta Pat released his debut album. Then Pistol signed to Ruthless and dropped his album \"hittin like a bullet\". He represented the Dirty South in the Ruthless \"camp\".\n\nCheck also out: article from June 2000 (Tn rap scene)\n\nPo, Broke and Lonely\n\nUnderground r&b group that was signed to Ruthless.\n\nRhythm D\n\nRhythm D was down from day 1. His producing abilities made him making perfect the g-funk of the early 90's. He was one of Eazy's main producers and his tracklist include e.g. the infamous \"real muthaphuccin g's\" by Eazy-E, BG Knocc Out and Gangsta Dresta as well as \"take yo ride\" by Eazy-E, Mack 10 and MC Eiht. He is no doubt one of the best beatmakers from Ruthless.\n\nSteffon\n\nUnderground MC who was signed to Ruthless.\n\nStone\n\nProduced for Eazy. for additional info let me know.\n\nSylk\n\nSylk is an underground MC that worked with eazy and was signed to Ruthless. In the meanwhile she has released a lot of tight ish but isn't on ruthless any more.\n\nThe D.O.C.\n\nCheck out DOC's debut album \"no one can do it better\". This guy had such a dope flow, he couldn't be touched! Fast rhymes patter over Dre's and Yella's funky production. the DOC used many different, versatile and intelligent verses and words, always adding some new proves for his rhyme skills that were far away from the time's usual skills. DOC was 19 when his album dropped in 1989. He could have become one of the greatest MC's ever! Unfortunately in summer 89 he had a bad car accident and lost his voice for a while. Later he could speak again but his voice sounds real raspy. Listen to the \"chronic\" and \"niggaz4life\", you will hear him. Yeah, also DOC left Ruthless cuz from his point of view Eazy didn't pay his artists the money they had deserved. He went to Death Row but didn't get his dues neither. So he dropped and signed to Giant Records for his tight 1996 release \"helter skelter\". On \"from ruthless 2 death row\" he explains the whole story. The DOC was really gifted. he still can rap very well but he would be untouchable with his old lyrical skills. If you see one of the 2 records get your hand on them, they are both worth their money!\n\nTomica Woods-Wright\n\nTomica is Eazy's widow and since E's death in 95 CEO of Ruthless. Cuz of her wrong business moves almost every group and artist has already left Ruthless Records. Some left already when E died, others like Ren followed. As Cold 187um says: \"nobody wants to deal with Tomica\". Bizzy Bone disses her in the booklet of his solo album, saying: \"fuck the black widow for running ruthless to the floor\". I dunno waz up with this lady but she wasn't a big help for Ruthless at all.\n\nTony and Julio G\n\nTony G\n\nThese 2 DJ's and producers are some OG's in the L.A. rap scene. They have been in the game for so long and have been always down with Ruthless. they didn't do much production but the few things they did were tight.\n\nTootsie\n\nProducer for Ren. if you got additional info let me know.\n\nTouchtone\n\nProducer for Ren. If you got additional info let me know.\n\nVIV\n\nstill signed to Ruthless\n\nI never heard of her, probably an r&b singer. if you got additional info let me know.\n\nWish Bone\n\nsigned to Ruthless as a member of Bone Thugs n Harmony\n\nThe most underrated Bone member. Wish got some intelligent rap lyrics and the strongest voice of the Bone members.\n\nYomo and Maulkie\n\nUnderground rap duo, produced by DJ Yella\n\nRuthless artists worked together with e.g. 2pac, Snoop Dogg, Yukmouth, 8Ball & MJG, T-Mix, Ant Banks, Mack 10 and others.\n\ndo you think any ruthless connected artists are missing? then let me know!\n\nEazy (1963-1995) dedication gallery\n\nEazy-E, member of the crips\n\nEazy with Dre\n\nEazy-E and Bone\n\nYella - \"4 tha e\"\n\nstraight off tha streets of"
