        "text": "Hi. Welcome to episode 1 of Sample Excavator, I’m your host Angelo Robledo, a sample archaeologist digging through sample and production history to piece together the stories behind the world’s biggest records. Each episode will follow one sample or sound, either going from the present to the past, or the past to the present. I am so excited to kick off this podcast with this episode, because it shows off the wide variety of ways samples can be used. This week’s sample comes from west coast female hip hop group JJ Fad. Originally a quintet in 1985 and one of the first acts signed to Eazy-E’s Ruthless Records, it quickly dissolved into a trio. The trio, comprised of Juana Burns, aka MC JB, Dania Burks aka Baby D, and Michelle Franklin, aka Sassy C., recorded and released their breakout single SuperSonic, produced by the Arabian Prince, in 1988. This single went on to sell half a million copies and their subsequent album of the same name was successful enough to make them the first female rap group ever to be nominated for a Grammy. While JJ Fad didn’t have much success after this album, Supersonic had a lasting impact on both pop music and hip hop for decades.\n\nBefore moving into the songs that have sampled or referenced Supersonic, i want to take a second to talk about copyright and what that means in the context of sampling. When a song is copyrighted, two copyrights are actually filed. The first is the written sheet music containing the melody and lyrics of the song, which is attributed and owned by the songwriter. The second is the actual master mix of the song, the recording itself that is released to the masses. The rights to that copyright are generally split between the record company, the performing artist, and the producer. If someone wants to sample a song they have two options. They can actually splice in pieces of the original recorded material into their music, which is actually what is meant when something is called a sample, OR they can recreate the melodies or drums they with to use themselves with their own instruments for use in their song. Either way, onus is on the producer to talk to work out a deal with the owner of the original copyright for their intended sample before releasing their song to the public. This is what is meant when ‘clearing a sample’ is talked about. The benefit of interpolation over direct sampling is that it can occasionally be cheaper and is worked out with the songwriter of the original song as opposed to the record company of the master recording. The use of supersonic in pop music is interesting because it has been both interpolated and directly sampled. That’s enough legal jargon for now, but as we go through episodes I’ll be referring to some of these terms and wanted to clear them, pardon the pun, before proceeding.\n\nBack to supersonic. The first major sample of supersonic comes from MF DOOM. MF DOOM is easily my favorite solo rapper of all time. Based out of the UK, MF DOOM is a full on super villain in the rap industry. He is largely underground but known as your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper because of his influence. He produces almost all of his songs and beats by himself, and is largely regarded to have the best and most complex rhyming in rap hands down. His earlier work from the late 90’s and early 2000’s is marked by incredible uses of samples, particularly from jazz and blues. This time however, he samples JJ Fad in his 2004 album MM Food which contains songs all centralized around food themes. In the song Hoe Cakes, he chops and loops the opening beatbox line from SuperSonic in order to create the drumline for his song. He actually made the beat in 2003 entitling it Jasmine Blossoms, but didnt rap over it until 2004. Take a listen. One of my favorite parts about this sample is not only the clever use of drums but also the use of JJ Fad singing the word Super to finish DOOM’s opening bars.\n\nJust a few years later in 2006 producer Will.i.am interpolated the title riff from supersonic for fellow Black Eyed Peas member Fergie, used in her hit song Fergalicious. A quite obvious interpolation but one not many people are aware of.\n\nThis use was actually surrounded in some controversy. While the original members of JJ Fad were given writing credits on the song in accordance to the agreement Will.I.Am made to clear the sample, Arabian Prince, the producer of song, felt he deserved credit as well. Will.I.Am got the sample cleared by ruthless records, who owned a majority percentage of the rights to the song. Arabian Prince owned 20% and believed he should have been in the decision process to clear the sample, but in lieu of that he should now be getting his 20% cut of whatever Will.I.Am is paying ruthless records. The suit was settled out of court but as of a 2016 interview with Arabian Prince, he is still claiming not to have received his fair due.\n\nDOOM’s sample and Fergie’s interpolation come from the main body of supersonic. However, the tail end of the song actually made an even bigger impact. It is the supersonic section where the members of JJ Fad try to rap as fast as possible. They use a mixture of actual bars and random words, all set to a rapid fire sixteen note rhythm. Released in a time when rap was slower and more laid back, supersonic stands out as one of the first times rappers tried to push the speed envelope but still remain accessible to the pop charts. Check it out at the 3:20 mark.\n\nThat makes this section of the song the most referenced part, as many rappers attempting fast rhymes in the 2010’s pay homage to the original supersonic rappers JJ Fad. Run the Jewels, comprised of rapper/producers Killer Mike and El-P reference JJ Fad during rapid fire sections of their songs “Go!” and “Call Ticketron”. (2:25 mark)\n\nEminem’s reference of Supersonic might be the most recognizable, as he mentions JJ Fad by name before going supersonic speed. (4:22)\n\nThe member of JJ Fad were much more enthusiastic about this shoutout and sample than they were with fergalicious; in a 2013 interview, MC JB talked about stoked she was about the shoutout and said, “We’re just so honored and thrilled that he chose us to do that.\n\nThat just about wraps up this episode of Sample Excavator. While I couldn’t go over every single Supersonic sample, hopefully those I presented effectively demonstrated the breadth of sample types and uses throughout the years. Sample Excavator is researched and written by Angelo Robledo, and produced by Guy Tannenbaum. Songs from today’s episode can be found on nearly all major streaming platforms."
