N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton is enjoying its third week atop the the box office, but it is still being picked apart for holes in its narrative weeks after release. In a revealing story published by the LA Times, pop/rap group J.J. Fad spoke about some of the issues they had with the story of Ruthless Records' in the film, specifically dealing with the perceived glossing over of their role in its creation as a music industry powerhouse.

If you don't remember, J.J. Fad was the trio behind the smash hit "Supersonic," which is largely credited for helping fund the N.W.A. project that Eazy E and Jerry Heller were planning at the time. They were also considered as one of the first females to break through in a mostly male dominated rap genre. Member Juana "MCJB" Sperling said that she liked the movie, but was rightfully a bit perturbed that the filmmakers didn't take "literally two seconds" to say their name. Ruthless co-founder Jerry Heller, played to perfection by Paul Giamatti in the film, said that: "They generated a lot of money for our company. People never thought about some of the other stuff we had there, like J.J. Fad and Michel'le, but that was a big part of the Ruthless story."

There could be many different interpretations on why the girls were snubbed, mostly due to the heavily Eazy-E and Dr. Dre centered plot perhaps, but Sperling has her own idea: "I think there was a certain image that they wanted to put out there, and I don't think they wanted us to soften that." She also said that the girls have no hard feelings or regrets for Dre or Cube, but the group wished that the movie took them into consideration. Read the rest of the story here.
