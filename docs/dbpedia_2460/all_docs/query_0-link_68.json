        "text": "Visitors take part in the Battle of Hamel virtual reality experience in the BAE Systems Theatre.\n\nThe average website user session duration remained steady at around four minutes. There was a significant improvement in the bounce rate (exiting a webpage without interacting with it) which decreased by 74 percent. This is an excellent result for the Memorial’s website redesign project, which aimed to improve search results, navigation, and prevent unnecessary visits to webpages.\n\nMobile access to the website decreased, accounting for 30 per cent of total users (a decrease on last year’s total of 36 per cent). However, tablet access increased slightly to 15 per cent (up from 14 per cent in the previous period).\n\n■ Performance target\n\nNumber of social media interactions\n\n> Result\n\nThe Memorial continues to grow its social media following and achieve strong engagement on social media posts.\n\nThe Memorial has two Flickr accounts, one dedicated to images and items from the National Collection, the other featuring images related to the Memorial and its official events. The Australian War Memorial Collection account has received 5.8 million views and the Australian War Memorial account 11.8 million views since they were established in 2008.\n\nFacebook continues to be the most popular social networking platform for the Memorial. There are now more than 106,700 followers of the Australian War Memorial Facebook page, an increase of more than 7,000 from last year. Changes to the Facebook algorithm have noticeably impacted upon the reach and number of impressions received. The reach of Facebook posts ranges from 1–2 million people per month, a decrease on the 1–3 million people per month during 2016–17. However, a concerted effort by the Memorial to drive social media activity through the publishing of quality content, attention to audience interests, and alignment with strategic objectives, has resulted in a higher level of audience engagement of 7.5 per cent in 2017–18. This result is more than three times the level of engagement achieved by the Memorial during 2016–17, and more than twice the top industry benchmarks for social media engagement.\n\nOutput 1.7 – Research and information dissemination\n\nOverview\n\nA wide range of research and dissemination activities was undertaken during the year, including publication of military history books and articles, media broadcasts, individual research projects, family history workshops, website provision of digitised official and private records, and the provision of military history information and research assistance through the Research Centre enquiry service and the Military History Section.\n\nThe centenary of the First World War has continued to generate unprecedented interest in the Memorial, its collections, commemorative activities, and stories of the Australian experience of war. This has continued into this year as the Memorial commemorates major military events of 1918. The Memorial has assisted enquiries in record numbers, from people using the collections to trace their families’ military history through to those performing academic research, writing books, or producing documentary films and news media.\n\nMemorial staff disseminated military history in various ways during the year:\n\ndelivered research papers and public talks on aspects of Australian military history at conferences and seminars, and in association with Memorial exhibitions and other public programs\n\nprovided military history advice for a wide range of corporate needs, including major commemorative functions, official government programs, media requirements, and in-house training\n\ncontributed to the development of Memorial permanent and touring exhibitions\n\npublished scholarly and popular books and articles on a wide range of Australian military history subjects.\n\nWartime magazine\n\nProduction of the Memorial’s popular military history magazine, Wartime, continued during 2017–18, as the magazine celebrated its 20th year of publication. Four issues (numbers 79–82) were published, featuring highquality, popular, and engaging articles. A high proportion of articles in Wartime were written by Memorial historians and other Memorial staff, while a number of articles were commissioned from eminent historians in Australia, Britain, and the United States. The magazine continued the successful practice of themed issues, featuring collections of articles on war in the Mediterranean (issue 79); Passchendaele (issue 80), this issue also featuring a celebration of 20 years of the publication of Wartime; Special Forces, coinciding with the Memorial’s From the shadows: Australia’s Special Forces exhibition (issue 81); and 1918 (issue 82).\n\nMilitary history publications\n\nThe civilisation of Port Phillip: settler ideology, violence, and rhetorical possession, was published in February 2018\n\nA revised and updated edition of Anzacs on the Western Front: the Australian War Memorial Battlefield Guide, originally published in 2012, was published in 2018.\n\nIndependent history of the medical legacies of Vietnam War\n\nAn independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War was commissioned by the Memorial Council and is being led by Dr Peter Yule, a research fellow at the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne. Dr Yule is documenting and examining existing medical studies and research, and undertaking new oral history interviews to enable the authoring of a broad history on the medical legacies of the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring 2017–18 excellent progress has been made by Dr Yule and his assistant in researching a variety of records, including those from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA), the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, and the Evatt Royal Commission, as well as a large volume of secondary sources. Consultant epidemiologist, Dr Michael Fett, has completed summarising the scientific literature for the project, while more interviews were conducted with Vietnam veterans and key government and DVA officials. To date, 13 chapters of the book have been drafted.\n\nOfficial history of East Timor, Iraq, and Afghanistan\n\nIn March 2018, Cabinet approved an extension for the project from the five years originally funded to six-and-a-half years. As such, all six volumes of the series are now due to be submitted for clearance by the end of 2022. Good progress has been made in the reporting period as incremental advances are made with the flow of records from the Department of Defence. This includes recent arrangements facilitated by the Governance and Reform Division to access records held by Headquarters, Joint Operations Command (HQJOC).\n\nIn general terms, research for the six volumes of the series can be divided into three parts: secondary source work, which is largely complete; an interviewing/oral history program, which is progressing satisfactorily for all volumes; and research conducted from official files/records. This type of research requires access to documents generated by a range of stakeholder departments and agencies.\n\nWork is nearing completion with the records of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and is largely complete with records of the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the National Archives of Australia. Work with DFAT records held by the department is continuing. No significant issues exist with any of these departments. All agencies of the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC) have begun the process of providing the project with relevant records or appropriate summaries of their operational activities.\n\nDue to the AIC-imposed requirement to review every nonintelligence-agency-owned Defence document before it is passed to the project, it remains difficult for Defence to meet project-driven targets for the provision of records. Nonetheless, considerable improvements are evident. From a low point of around 300 documents per week in August 2017, the Defence weekly average is now in the vicinity of 900 documents per week.\n\nA draft of volume one of the Official History series, concerning Australian operations in response to the East Timor crisis 1999–2000, will be completed and submitted for departmental/agency clearance this calendar year – well in advance of its sister volumes, and the overall project plan.\n\nOfficial history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post–Cold War operations\n\nThe Memorial continues to deliver the six-volume Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post–Cold War operations, assisted by funding from the Department of Defence.\n\nIn addition to the four volumes published previously, a further two volumes are being finalised for publication later in 2018:\n\nVolume IV The limits of peacekeeping: Australian missions in Africa and the Americas, 1993–2006\n\nVolume I The long search for peace: observer missions and beyond, 1947–2006.\n\nThe Simpson Prize\n\nIn collaboration with the History Teachers’ Association of Australia and the Department of Education and Training, the Memorial continues to support the annual Simpson Prize, a national essay-writing competition for secondary students. The Memorial’s Education team researches, develops, and hosts online the Simpson Prize question, and provides relevant source material from the Memorial’s collection to assist students with their research and writing. Winners are chosen from each state and territory by representatives of the History Teachers’ Association. In April 2018, as part of their prize, they undertook a tour of the First World War battlefields of the Western Front in Belgium and France, led by a senior Memorial historian. The group attended the centenary Anzac Day ceremony at the Australian National Memorial and visited the Victoria School in VillersBretonneux, France. Personal accounts by students from the 2018 Simpson Prize battlefield tour were published on the Memorial’s website.\n\nBryan Gandevia Prize for Military History\n\nA generous bequest in 2009 by the family and friends of the late Professor Bryan Gandevia enabled the establishment of a prize to commemorate Professor Gandevia’s contribution to the development of Australian military and medical history, and the historical research and publication activities of the Australian War Memorial. The Bryan Gandevia Prize of $5,000 is one of the most generous awards for postgraduate studies in Australian history. It is awarded biennially to an outstanding honours, masters, or doctoral thesis on a significant subject within Australian military history, militarymedical history, or military-social history.\n\nThe Bryan Gandevia Prize for theses submitted between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2018 will be judged internally by a panel of senior historians of the Australian War Memorial and externally by a distinguished specialist in Australian military, social, and political history.\n\nThe annual Summer Scholars program\n\nScholars are selected through a competitive, merit-based selection process that is open to university students at a late stage of their history degrees, customarily honours graduates. They are assigned individual research projects and are supervised and professionally guided by Memorial historians.\n\nThree scholars successfully completed research projects related to the Memorial’s historical research, collections, exhibitions, and publications:\n\nDanielle Broadhurst (Deakin University) – Recovery in the trenches: the Australian Corps and the Flanders winter, November 1917 to March 1918\n\nEllen Cresswell (University of Sydney) – The experiment: technological testing at the battle of Hamel, 4 July 1918\n\nJessica Urwin (Australian National University) – A fleeting opportunity to strike: the experience of Australians serving in RAF Coastal Command in the Second World War\n\nThe scholars delivered public presentations on their findings at the conclusion of the program. Their research reports are published on the Memorial’s website.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nNumber of talks, lectures, speeches, and conference papers delivered by Memorial staff\n\n> Result\n\nForm of article Quantity Articles 48 Books 1 Book chapter 4 Book review 2 Conference paper 12 Interview 90 Lecture 16 Talk off-site 26 Talk on-site 95 Total 294\n\nFull details of the talks, lectures, conference papers, etc. delivered by Memorial staff can be found at Appendix 4.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nThe number of visitors to the Research Centre’s Reading Room\n\n> Result\n\nThe Memorial’s Research Centre continued to attract large numbers of visitors with 37,945 people visiting the Reading Room during the reporting period, a reduction of approximately 18 percent on the previous period. During the reporting period 11,830 items were retrieved for and accessed by Reading Room clients\n\n■ Performance target\n\nTotal number of items retrieved for and accessed by Reading Room clients\n\n> Result\n\nA total of 11,830 items were retrieved for and accessed by Reading Room clients in the reporting period, a drop of approximately 25 percent on 2016–17.\n\nWhile the number of visits to the Research Centre and items requested has declined in 2017–18, the number of pages copied increased by 25,000 to 55,312. This may reflect researchers undertaking their research remotely, purchasing copies of records and utilising the digitised records available online. The lower figures may also reflect the conclusion of First World War centenary, which marked a high point of research and preparation for commemorative publications and events taking place earlier in the centenary period.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nSales figures from Wartime and other publications produced by the Memorial.\n\n> Result\n\nPublication type 2017–18 2016–17 Wartime 24,143 24,605 Books 1,343* 3,528 Exhibition catalogues 175 258 Souvenir publications 11,716 11,042\n\n* The figure for 2017–18 is markedly lower than 2016–17 as there were no new mass-market publications during the reporting period.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nThe number of page views accessing the Memorial’s online research facilities.\n\n> Result\n\nFacilitating broad access to collections through the provision of digitised content is a high priority for the Memorial. Data clean-up has continued in 2017–18, creating cleaner and more accurate search results. The Memorial’s online encyclopaedia continues to be a popular source of support for independent research by the public, as well as assisting staff address frequently asked questions. Encyclopaedia pages received over 1,065,900 views during 2017–18. The single most viewed page was the Gallipoli page, with a total of 57,176 views. The other most heavily used pages were the prisoner of war, Indigenous, and Anzac biscuit recipe pages, with 92,492 page views combined.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nThe number of research enquiries answered by Memorial staff.\n\n> Result\n\nDuring 2017–18, Research Centre staff answered 10,867 enquiries made online, by telephone email, or through the mail. Email and online enquiries are the most popular form of contact with figures more than doubling those received by telephone and letter.\n\nDuring the same reporting period, Military History section staff answered, 2,800 research enquiries made online, by telephone, and vial mail from the public and the media, and through the offices of the minister, prime minister, and other government agencies.\n\nOutput 1.8 – Visitor services\n\nVisitors to the Memorial and its outreach programs are provided with a standard of service that enhances their experience and encourages them to return and promote others to visit.\n\nOverview\n\nThe 2017–18 reporting period saw 1.088 million people visit the Australian War Memorial’s Campbell site. The commitment of the front-of-house team saw the ongoing provision and delivery of world-class service excellence to a diverse audience.\n\nVisitors continued to enjoy an excellent experience, evidenced by the recent TripAdvisor data which saw the Memorial’s continued ranking in the top three of the top ten landmarks within Australia. Approximately 90 per cent of TripAdvisor respondents rated their visit to the Memorial as excellent and 8 per cent as very good. This was re-enforced by 90 per cent of surveyed visitors to the Memorial also stating that their visit had met or exceeded their expectation, with 85 percent stating that the Memorial had improved since their last visit.\n\nA sample of feedback from our visitors follows:\n\nStaff are extremely helpful and whether it be sight-seeing or research, every request is met in an outstanding manner\n\nJim O, May 2018\n\nStaff are amazing here and they embrace the importance of this place in what they do and you’d be hard pressed not to notice this.\n\nCampbell C, 4 January 2018\n\nEvery aspect is engaging and captivating and the staff are truly interested and passionate about the work of the AWM\n\nDanielle H, 17 December 2017\n\nThis is one of the most wonderful facilities with the most wonderful staff and volunteers I have ever visited\n\nSusan J, 11 July 2017\n\n■ Performance target\n\nFront of house staff trained to deliver high-level customer service and voluntary guides trained to an introductory level of military history\n\n> Result\n\n97 per cent very satisfied or satisfied with staff assistance (81 per cent very satisfied)\n\n97 per cent very satisfied or satisfied with guided tours (82 per cent very satisfied).\n\nOngoing front-of-house training has been delivered throughout the course of the financial year.

The training aligns with the nationally recognised Deliver Public Programs skill set, taken from the Library, Information and Cultural Services training package. It also sees a number of experts from across a number of Memorial sections present to the trainees over the course of the training. This tertiary level training affords our newest voluntary guides with the skills and ability to structure and deliver not only informative tours to Memorial visitors, but tours which are engaging and professional.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nHigh quality and suitable public facilities such as restrooms, café, and way-finding signs.\n\n> Result\n\n87 per cent very satisfied or satisfied with Poppys café (62 per cent very satisfied)\n\n87 per cent very satisfied or satisfied with the Landing Place (56 per cent very satisfied)\n\n92 per cent very satisfied or satisfied with wayfinding signage (57 per cent very satisfied)\n\n87 per cent very satisfied or satisfied with restrooms (56 per cent very satisfied).\n\nThe Memorial’s grounds and facilities are maintained by a team of dedicated professionals whose skill sets include horticulturists and arborists; carpenters and cabinetmakers; electricians and plumbers; groundskeepers; cleaners; project managers; and contracted specialists such as fire and lift technicians. The iconic, heritage-listed building and its surrounds presents unique challenges and opportunities to ensure the Memorial’s facilities are easily accessible and maintained to the highest standard.\n\nAfter a competitive tender process, in March 2018, the Trippas White Group commenced as the Memorial’s contracted catering provider. Trippas White Group manages a diverse portfolio of iconic restaurant, café and event spaces across Australia.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nAt least 90 per cent of surveyed visitors state that the Memorial has met or exceeded their expectations.\n\n> Result\n\n99 per cent of surveyed respondents stated that the memorial had met or exceeded their expectations:\n\n60 per cent of surveyed respondents stated that the Memorial had exceeded their expectations\n\n39 per cent of surveyed respondents stated that the Memorial had met their expectations.\n\nPeople who had visited in the recent past were more likely to state that the Memorial had met their expectations.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nAt least 90 per cent of surveyed visitors state that the Memorial has maintained or improved its standard of service since their last visit.\n\n> Result\n\n99 per cent of visitors thought the Memorial had improved or maintained its standard of service since their last visit.\n\n■ Performance target\n\nOpportunities for visitor feedback such as service charter, visitors’ book, and evaluation services.\n\n> Result\n\nIn addition to the visitors’ book and café feedback cards, the Memorial invited general visitors to contribute their views in the following audience research surveys:\n\nGeneral visitor exit survey\n\nCafés exit survey\n\nFor Country, for Nation exit survey\n\nFrom the shadows exit survey.\n\nOutput 1.9 – Corporate governance\n\nThe Council of the Australian War Memorial provides a strategic framework of policy and direction that guides the achievement of the Memorial’s outcome.\n\nIn accordance with its planned schedule, Council and the Finance, Audit, and Compliance Committee each met four times during the year. The Remuneration Committee and the Roll of Honour Committee each met once.\n\nThe Chair of Council and the Director of the Memorial provided a briefing to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs after each meeting. The Memorial’s senior management team met with senior representatives of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to discuss matters relevant to both parties.\n\nThrough the process of Council and committee meetings, detailed papers and recommendations were presented by the Memorial’s management. The major considerations and decisions undertaken by Council related to:\n\na program of events for the end of the centenary of the First World War\n\nprogress in relation to the Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post–Cold War operations, the Official history of East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War\n\nfurther development of a Memorial Master Plan, including implementation of long-term storage solutions for the National Collection\n\noversight of the Memorial’s Strategic Priorities 2018–2022\n\ncriteria for inclusion on the Roll of Honour\n\nthe Memorial’s Organisational Review.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) continued as the Memorial’s internal auditor. Members of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) and PwC attended each of the Finance, Audit, and Compliance Committee meetings. A program of audits was approved by Council for the 2017–18 financial year and the outcomes of reviews undertaken were presented at each meeting.\n\nOutput 1.10 – Executive strategic management\n\nExecutive leadership\n\nThe Memorial’s executive leadership and management framework includes a Corporate Management Group (CMG), consisting of the Director and three assistant directors; and a Senior Management Group (SMG) comprised of all section heads and members of the CMG.\n\nThe SMG meets weekly and is a forum for the exchange of information and discussion of corporate issues. Feedback from CMG and SMG meetings is provided to all staff through weekly section meetings.\n\nDuring this past year, there were a number of changes to SMG. Two important outside appointments were made when Ms Helen Petrovski joined the Memorial as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Head of Finance and Mr John Rodgers was appointed as Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Head of Information Technology. There were a number of internal appointments at senior level through the year, with Ms Melinda Coen taking up the role of Head of Collection Services, and Ms Suzanne Myers being appointed as the Head of Exhibitions, both having acted in those positions for some time. With the departure of Mr Ryan Johnston the role of acting Head of Art has been filled by Dr Anthea Gunn and Ms Webster was subsequently appointed as Head of Art.\n\nThe CMG meets weekly and considers a wide range of matters brought forward by its members or via papers from section heads. Quarterly reports are presented to monitor the Memorial’s performance against a range of criteria. The CFO presents a set of financial statements on a regular basis and provides direct advice to senior management.\n\nMs Leanne Patterson, who had been acting Assistant Director Corporate Services (ADCS) since January 2016 was appointed to the role permanently in July 2017 following the long service leave and retirement of the substantive ADCS, Ms Rhonda Adler.\n\nThe Assistant Director of National Collections (ADNC), Mr Tim Sullivan resigned in November 2017 after four years of service to the Memorial.

The focus of these control groups is to ensure projects are delivered according to their objectives, timeframes, and budgets.\n\nThe Information Management Steering Group (IMSG) meets monthly and is key to determining the strategic direction of information management, information and communications technology (ICT), and web initiatives. This area of business continues to grow and underpins many of the Memorial’s corporate objectives. The prioritisation of available resources is a major focus of IMSG. During 2017–18 the Memorial commenced the three-year implementation of its IT Modernisation Project using monies from the Public Service Modernisation Fund.\n\nThe Assistant Director, National Collection, chairs the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) Working Group which has produced the Memorial’s Reflect RAP. The Reflect RAP is designed to identify and implement initiatives to help provide services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders, visitors, and users of our services. It provides a framework for further development of information resources and services, employment strategies, and engagement with the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures, and military service.\n\nA wide range of statistical information is collated and presented on a quarterly basis to assess trends across business activities.\n\nThe Memorial continued its efforts to secure corporate sponsorship and support through grants from government and non-government partners. Other individual supporters continue to provide financial support for the Memorial’s projects and public programs. A full report of revenue generation is at section 1.12 ‘Revenue Generation’ commencing on page 70.\n\nStrategic management\n\nThe Memorial’s strategic planning framework encourages participation by all staff, promoting the concept of one team working to achieve common goals and recognising the importance of communication and ownership of decisions.\n\nIn February 2018, recognising that the end of the Centenary of Anzac period will have wide ranging effects on its operations, the Memorial undertook to re-examine its strategic priorities as part of its annual corporate planning process. The revised Corporate Plan 2018–22 now incorporates five strategic priorities, each supported by key enabling strategies to achieve those goals over the medium term. The Corporate Plan 2018–22 is closely aligned with the Memorial’s Portfolio Budget Statement commitments and progress is reported to Council quarterly.\n\nThe Memorial also continued to plan for the long term through efforts to develop the Memorial Redevelopment Project Initial and Detailed Business Cases. These are an important part of the Memorial’s planning for managing collection, visitation and commemoration beyond the Corporate Plan 2018–22.\n\nAnnual business plans and accompanying budgets are developed to support Council directions and corporate plan priorities. Once developed, annual business plans, closely aligned to the Corporate Plan, influence day-today operations. Achievements are monitored and formally reported quarterly to CMG and Council, with exceptions reported as required.\n\nRisk management and business continuity\n\nFraud risk\n\nThe Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework outlines the Australian Government’s requirements for fraud control, including that government entities put in place a comprehensive fraud control program that covers prevention, detection, investigation, and reporting strategies. In January 2017 the Memorial undertook its triennial re-assessment of its fraud control framework. The resulting report and plan identified:\n\nno risks above moderate\n\nseven moderate risks\n\nseven low risks\n\nfive very low risks.\n\nRisks rated moderate to very low are managed within existing resources and are monitored and reported as part of the Memorial’s existing quarterly risk management framework. The identified risks are reviewed quarterly to ensure the appropriateness of the assessment and their mitigation strategies, and to identify any new or emerging risks.\n\nThe triennial risk assessments inform the allocation of the Memorial’s risk management resources and efforts.\n\nBusiness risk\n\nIn October 2016 the Memorial undertook its triennial Business Risk Assessment. Senior management, with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the threats to the Memorial’s ability to meet its objectives and identified appropriate controls and mitigation strategies.\n\nManagement of the Memorial’s key business risks have been incorporated into corporate and annual business planning processes and are formally reviewed quarterly, including consideration of new and emerging risks and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Progress against the proposed actions to address the high and significant risks are monitored by senior management and reported quarterly to Council.\n\nRisk benchmarking\n\nEach year the Memorial participates in Comcover’s annual risk management benchmarking survey, which provides a basis to measure our performance against similar government agencies and identifies areas for possible improvement.\n\nSignificant work over the last 18 months to strengthen the Memorial’s risk management framework has proven worthwhile, not only to ensure the robustness of our risk management capability and governance, but also in improving our standing among our cultural institution peers. Our improved risk management framework has reduced our overall vulnerability and is reflected in reduced Comcover insurance premiums and improved risk maturity ranking. Comcover ranks each agency’s risk management maturity as being fundamental, developed, systematic, integrated, advanced, or optimal. Over the last two years, the Memorial has graduated from integrated to advanced, placing us well ahead of like institutions whose average maturity across all elements is in the lower end of integrated.\n\nIn keeping with the recommendations contained in the Comcover survey report, the Memorial will, in the coming period, focus its efforts on embedding risk management practices and enhanced education opportunities for staff.\n\nBusiness continuity\n\nIn February 2018, members of the Memorial’s Senior Management Group, with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers facilitators, undertook business continuity scenario testing.\n\nThe exercise confirmed the strengths of the Memorial’s current business continuity arrangements, and offered suggestions to enhance to overall response regime. Overall, PwC noted that the Memorial’s business continuity framework was robust and sufficiently flexible for most circumstances.\n\nEvaluation and visitor research\n\nThe Memorial continued its standard audience research relating to general visitor benchmarking, cafe catering customer service, special exhibitions, and audience profiling.\n\nThe survey projects that have been used to inform this Annual Report are:\n\nResearch project Sample n= General visitor exit survey (GVS) 693 From the shadows special exhibition exit survey 298 For Country, for Nation special exhibition survey 298\n\nGreater attention has also been directed towards defining how the Memorial contributes to the way visitors understand Australian military history. In order to understand what factors could be influencing visitation levels there has been increasing interest in understanding how visitors make the decision to visit the Memorial and plan their travel.\n\nThis year the Memorial commenced preparations to upgrade all survey processes in the 2018–19 financial year to enable faster, up-to-the-minute results reporting in alignment with the exciting range of ways that the public can now engage with the Memorial. The priority focus for this will be include a website-integrated survey, and touchscreen surveys with digital data entry.\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nAppendix 1 – Council profile\n\nVice Admiral Tim Barrett AO CSC RAN joined Council in July 2014 when he assumed command of the Royal Australian Navy.
