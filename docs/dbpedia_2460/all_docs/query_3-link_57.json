        "text": "Celebrating 75 Years: 1948-2023\n\nAs one of the nation's leading dental schools, the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Dentistry is celebrating 75 years of providing world-class dental education, research, and oral healthcare with a focus on shaping the future of oral health.\n\nOur Deans\n\nJoseph F.

Taichman, 2019- 2023\n\nNicolaas Geurs,\n\n(Interim) 2023-2024, 2024\n\nA Message from Interim Dean Geurs on October 18, 2023\n\nDear SOD Family,\n\nThe UAB School of Dentistry has a rich history that spans more than seven decades and is marked by remarkable achievements and contributions to dental education, research, and clinical practice.\n\nIt all began with Dr. Joseph Volker, who was focused on the future from the day he became our founding dean. Over the years, he worked to secure funding for research and maintained relationships with universities across the world. He also pioneered relationships with many local institutions, including the first joint venture in the nation between a veterans hospital and a dental school. By the early 1960s, Volker had established a young UAB School of Dentistry as one of the leading dental programs in the nation.\n\nSince our establishment on October 18, 1948, we have made incredible strides – embracing cutting-edge techniques and technologies, building collaborations, and shaping the future of dentistry. We have produced a cadre of skilled and compassionate dental professionals, contributing significantly to oral health in Alabama and beyond. Our commitment to excellence has been unwavering, and we are immensely proud of the impact we have had on the lives of countless patients.\n\nTo commemorate this historic occasion, we have enjoyed a series of special events and initiatives this year that kicked off with Alumni Weekend in February and will be culminating in student, employee, and alumni celebrations this week. And today, we are pleased to announce that a new 75th Anniversary website is now live. We hope you will enjoy learning more about our extraordinary history.\n\nAlthough the stage was set by visionary leaders like Dr. Volker and his successor Dr. Charles McCallum, the milestone of our 75th anniversary is as much a testament to the dedication and hard work of our faculty, staff, students, and alumni throughout the years. You are an integral part of our legacy, and your support has been invaluable in making the UAB School of Dentistry what it is today. Thank you for being a part of our journey.\n\nThis year’s celebration is not only a reflection on our school's remarkable history but also an opportunity to look forward to the continued contributions the school will make in the years to come. Here's to 75 years of excellence, and to many more years of shaping smiles and changing lives!\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nNicolaas Geurs, DDS, MS\n\nWeatherford/Palcanis Endowed Professor\n\nInterim Dean\n\nAt 75 years young, UAB School of Dentistry continues to provide world-class dental education\n\nRead More\n\nAbout the 1940's-1950's\n\n1945: Dentists Advisory Board\n\nAccording to an alumni newsletter: The Dentists Advisory Board to the University of Alabama School of Dentistry was created by the legislation that established the School of Dentistry in 1945. Governor Chauncy Sparks did not appoint the first Board until November, 1946 and funds to operate the school were not appropriated until 1947. The first Dentists Advisory Board was composed of Dr. Moren H. Fuller (Centerville), Dr Olin Kirkland (Montgomery), Dr. C. B. Bray (Birmingham), Dr. John H. Sullivan (Mobile) and Dr. Richard R. Moorer (Eufaula). Dr. Fuller was appointed chairman by Governor Sparks. Dr. Moren Fuller was not well known by his Alabama colleagues and he was completely unknown in dental academia. He never held an ALDA office, but he was highly respected by his community. Governor Sparks figured competent academicians could be hired, but respected Alabama dentists knew what was best for our citizens. Dr. Olin Kirkland was the best known Alabama dentist before the dental school was established. His peers had voted him “The Alabama Dentist of the First half of the 20th Century” in 1950. Dr. John Sullivan’s brother, Joseph C. Sullivan, Jr., J.D., introduced the bill in the Alabama House of Representatives that created the School of Dentistry. Another brother, Dr. George J. Sullivan, was a Mobile dentist, as was their father, Dr. Joseph Charles Sullivan, Sr. (Philadelphia Dental College, 1891). Dr. Richard R. Moorer was Governor Spark’s personal dentist, which certainly justified his appointment. Dr. Fuller spent a lot of time at the school during its early years and Dean Volker treated him with proper respect. The first students were thankful for the school because many of them were World War II veterans with impeccable credentials (or tickets, as Joe Volker called them) to enter dental school, but they had been unable to find a spot in out-of-state universities. They came to believe that Dr. Fuller was their personal benefactor so the young Dental Alumni Association chose to honor Dr. Fuller and to make the award his namesake.\n\nOctober 9, 1947: Alabama Act 678\n\nAlabama Act 678 appropriated funds of $750,000 for the operation of the University of Alabama School of Dentistry.\n\nFall 1948: Dr. Volker recruited to serve\n\nJoseph F. Volker, D.D.S., a dental researcher and educator, was recruited to serve as the school’s founding dean. Already dean at Tufts College Dental School, Dr. Volker retained his position at Tufts throughout the academic year of 1948-1949 and organized the University of Alabama School of Dentistry in 48 days in the fall of 1948.\n\nOctober 18, 1948: First class\n\nThe School of Dentistry was founded, as fifty-two freshmen, all veterans, began classes at the School of Dentistry.\n\nAmong the 23 full-time faculty, all were male. There were two female members of the part-time faculty: Drs. Polly Ayers and Eleanor A. Hunt. Several of the school’s initial faculty held primary appointments in the medical school but also taught basic science courses to the first dental students.\n\n1950’s: Dr. Volker in Thailand\n\nDean Volker spent three months in Thailand as part of a US. State Department education program. Volker's trip was the first of many for him and for other UAB faculty, a tradition of international partnerships that has continued for seven decades. “Dr. Volker would likely be pleased as he had international students and post-docs in the dental school from the very early years, and he went to Thailand often during his time as dean,” said Tim Pennycuff, university archivist.\n\n1950's: Dr. Volker & Dr. Lazansky\n\nDr. Volker brings Dr. Lazansky from Boston.\n\n1951: SOD's first dental clinic\n\nVery soon after operations began, it was realized that new facilities were definitely needed for the dental school and for the departments of basic sciences. With the allocation of funds from the Hill-Burton Act and from local sources, the Medical and Dental Basic Science Building and Dental Clinic was constructed and completed in 1951. This was the school’s first dental clinic.\n\n1952: The Dentala\n\nThe Dentala, a student yearbook for the University of Alabama School of Dentistry, was first published.\n\nDr. Josef Peter Lazansky became director of the Division of Dental Medicine and Surgery in the School of Dentistry. A native of what was then Czechoslovakia, Lazansky was the first international named as a divisional director at the Medical Center in Birmingham.\n\nMay 31, 1952: Graduation day\n\nGraduation Day finally arrived for the school’s inaugural D.M.D. class.\n\n1954: Dental Hygiene Program\n\nThe School of Dentistry's dental hygiene program, directed by Dr. Marjorie Houston, became the first nationally accredited training program in the Southeast.\n\nMay 30, 1954: First female graduates\n\nClaudia Holcombe Heard and Ruth Ehricke became the first female graduates of the School of Dentistry.\n\nMid 1950s: International reputation\n\nThe excellence of the school earned it an international reputation and by the mid-1950s the school boasted students from around the world. Research also became a vital activity at the School of Dentistry, and the school received monies from a number of public and private agencies. As its reputation increased, the school was able to attract leading dental researchers.\n\n1955: Fuller Award created, awarded to Dr. Fuller\n\nThe H. Moren Fuller Award was created to honor Dr. Moren H. Fuller of Centerville, who was appointed to serve on the first Dentists Advisory Board. The Dentists Advisory Board to the University of Alabama School of Dentistry was created by the legislation that established the School of Dentistry in 1945.\n\nAccording to the University of Alabama School of Dentistry Alumni Association: “Dr. Fuller spent a lot of time at the school during its early years and Dean Volker treated him with proper respect. The first students were thankful for the school because many of them were World War II veterans with impeccable credentials (or tickets, as Joe Volker called them) to enter dental school, but they had been unable to find a spot in out-of-state universities. They came to believe that Dr. Fuller was their personal benefactor, so the young Dental Alumni Association chose to honor Dr. Fuller and to make the award his namesake.”\n\n1956: SOD's Women's Club\n\nThe Women's Club of the University of Alabama School of Dentistry was organized with Mrs. E. E. Evans as first president.\n\nAbout the 1960's\n\n1960-1961: Dr. McCallum's leadership\n\nUnder Dean McCallum's leadership, the School of Dentistry grew during the 1960s and 1970s and additional departments were added. The school also received funding for one of the first Institutes of Dental Research in the nation.\n\n1960s: Four handed dentistry\n\nIn the 1960s researchers and clinicians at UAB’s School of Dentistry introduced a second person into the practice environment—and the concept of “four-handed dentistry” was born. Wuehrmann, who served as acting dean; was known for his research in this area.\n\n1960s: \"Century Club\"\n\nA “Century Club” of the school’s alumni purchased letters written by George and Martha Washington to their dentist. The club donated them to the Reynolds-Finley Historical Library at UAB, where they remain housed to this day.\n\nLetter by George Washington to his dentist, Dr. Baker of Philadelphia, dated Newburgh, New York, April 11, 1783.\n\nLetter by George Washington to Jno. Greenwood, dentist, New York, dated Philadelphia, July 1, 1792.\n\nLetter by Martha Washington to her dentist, Whitelock, dated Philadelphia, April 17, 1799.\n\nImages courtesy of the Reynolds-Finley Historical Library at UAB.\n\n1961: Dr. Volker & Dr. Finn\n\nDean Volker recruited Dr. Sidney Bernard Finn to UAB in 1961 to serve as Professor and first chair of the Department of Pedodontics. Throughout his career, Dr. Finn received a number of prestigious awards and made an enormous contribution to dental literature, especially in the fields of pediatric dentistry and caries research. Notably, he wrote one of the first textbooks on dentistry for children, entitled Clinical Pedodontics. As one of our own faculty members, leaders, and innovators in the profession, his efforts helped UAB School of Dentistry in its growth to national and international prominence. We now use his interpretation of The Dentist’s Pledge, the dentist honor code, in our White Coat Ceremony.\n\n1962: Dean McCallum succession\n\nThe School of Dentistry continued to grow and expand under the leadership of Dr. Charles A. “Scotty” McCallum, Jr., who succeeded Dr. Joseph F. Volker as dean in 1962.\n\n1962: First international faculty named as chairs\n\nDr. Lincoln Roy Manson-Hing became chair of the Department of Oral Roentgenology (later Dental Radiology) and Dr. Gilbert J. Parfitt became chair of the Department of Periodontics, both in the School of Dentistry. Dr. Manson-Hing was a native of British Guiana [Guyana] and Dr. Parfitt was a native of England. They were the first international faculty named as chairs of academic departments at the Medical Center in Birmingham.\n\n1965: Karen Clements Crunk\n\nKaren Clements Crunk, having moved to Tuscaloosa in 1962 as a pre-dentistry major at the University of Alabama, began dental school. In those days, pre-dental students could attend the University of Alabama for three years, and then receive their undergraduate degree after their first year in dental school. Completing her dental degree in 1969, she was among the school’s first female graduates.\n\n1965: First Black member of SOD's faculty\n\nDr. Clifton O. Dummett of the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Hospital received a clinical appointment in the School of Dentistry, becoming the first Black member of the school's faculty.\n\n1969: Dr. Volker becomes UAB's first president\n\nWhen Dr. Joseph Volker became UAB’s first president in 1969, he had a bold vision for our future that some people at the time considered extremely unlikely, wild, and even crazy. But those reactions did not deter him. Instead, Dr. Volker was powered by the will to grow our fledgling university into an internationally renowned leader in education, research and scholarship, and patient care.\n\nAbout the 1970's\n\nSeptember 1970: First Black students\n\nThe first Black students matriculated in the School of Dentistry.\n\nOctober 18, 1973: SOD celebrates 25 years\n\nSchool celebrates 25 year anniversary.\n\nJune 9, 1974: First Black graduates\n\nJimmie Walker, Jr., and Wilson Wright, Jr., became the first Black graduates of the School of Dentistry.\n\nOctober 8, 1974: Building renovations\n\nThe cornerstone of the five-story addition to the School of Dentistry was set on October 8, 1974, signaling the approach of the completion of the $9 million expansion and renovation program. The first three floors of the addition already were in use and the remaining floors were expected to be completed by December.\n\nMay 12, 1975: Student-Faculty lounge\n\nA rooftop Student-Faculty Lounge opened atop the new sixth floor addition to the school of dentistry building. Carpets, draperies and furniture were purchased with a gift of $11,000 from the Alabama Dental Alumni Association. An additional $500 gift from Dr. Belton Stephens (Class of 1953) was received for the purchase of additional furnishings. At the time, it was one of the largest individual gifts the school had received from an alumnus.\n\n1975: Dr. Eli Capilouto joins SOD faculty\n\nEli Capilouto joined the School of Dentistry faculty as an instructor in the department of operative dentistry. Revered by his students, he was named assistant professor in 1979. Dr. Capilouto, who would go on to serve as dean of the UAB School of Public Health as UAB Provost played a historic role within UAB and the UAB School of Dentistry through than 35 years of loyal service. His vision, commitment to excellence, and compassion all brought honor to UAB and the School of Dentistry.\n\n1975: Student activities\n\nStudent activities included a Christmas dance, a spring dance, Clinic Day, Field Day, and Senior Night.\n\n1975: Largest class ever (until that point)\n\nThe largest class ever (until that point) to graduate from the University of Alabama School of Dentistry, received their Doctor of Dental Medicine degrees this year.

The course, produced by the School of Dentistry, was part of a study designed to investigate the feasibility of using television to make continuing education more readily available to dentists practicing in remote areas. Dr. Barry Isenberg was the project director for the program, which was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Public Health Service. Two years into production, the series was written and produced at the UAB SOD using the school’s own television studio under the direction of Edward McDevitt. The series, entitled “Effective Utilization of the Chairside Dental Assistant, Work Simplification Procedures and the Use of Modern Dental Equipment,” covered a wide range of subjects of interest to dentists in private practice.\n\nJanuary 17, 1976: Building rededication\n\nThe Medical and Dental Basic Science Building and Dental Clinic was rededicated as the School of Dentistry Building, with $9.45M renovations of original clinic building and adjoining building, and a five-story addition.

Barrett\n\nIt is with great respect and admiration that the graduating class of 1991 dedicated the Dentala to one of our most distinguished faculty members, Dr. Charles E. Barrett. Dr. Barrett, Over the past 4 years there has been nothing that you were not willing to help with, and ‘thank you’ seems inappropriate for all you have done. Thought your constant support, you seems inappropriate for all you have one. Through your constant support you have helped make it possible for us to fulfill our dreams. May you always know that your are loved and appreciated, and may the happiness you have given return to fill each day of your life.\n\n-The Class of 1991\n\n1991: Student activities, organizations and rotations\n\nIn the early 1990s, student activities included the Christmas Dance, Bowling Night, Day to Day, Parents’ Day, Field Day, and Casino Night. Parents’ Visitation Day was held at the Highland Raquel Club on April 5, 1991. Student organizations included Student Government Association, Psi Omega, and Dentala. Rotations were Bryce Hospital and Community Dentistry. Honors Convocation was held June 1, 1991 at the Alabama Theatre.\n\n1993: D3 class hits the clinic\n\nAccording to the Dentala, the D3 class said:\n\nIn August, we hit the clinic floor, wide-eyed and trembling at the thought of a pulp exposure. Patients with real teeth… the ones that Millie couldn’t replace. The race was on to get those extra chairs in Perio. Our patients never thought that their gums had to be that healthy to get a “cap.” We also ventured into the world of dentures but hey, the patients were all ready to go. Well okay, at least some of them. By October and November, we had accepted the fact that long waiting lines for instruments and instructors would never get faster or shorter. Then came a well-deserved Christmas break… as we left we were concerned that some classmates had already cemented half of their crown and bridge, while others had not even cut a crown prep yet. We came back to the Dean’s New Year’s resolutions: the superbill and higher fees. Come April, we were in a panic… the race was on to find the elusive RPD that didn’t require Perio, extractions, or too many surveyed crowns. Evaluations in Perio, operative and ortho were handled as we made the last term. The end is finally approaching, and we see the white tape off in the distance — will we be finished by June 15??\n\n1993 & 1994: Student activities and organizations\n\nIn 1993, the Student Government Association held ‘Casual Christmas.’ Other student activities included Casino Night and Field Day. Student organizations also included ASDA, Honor Council and Psi Omega.\n\n1994: Administration\n\nThe school’s administration included Dean Matukas, Dr. David F. Greer as director of student affairs, Dr. Kent G. Palcanis as assistant dean of academic affairs, and Dr. Milton Essig as assistant dean of clinical affairs.\n\n1997: Comprehensive concept to patient care adopted\n\nCustomer satisfaction is one of the basic tenets of business. By providing good service, you build brand loyalty. When that same principle is applied to dental education – substituting patients for customers – the results are equally positive, according to Michael Reddy, D.M.D, a professor and assistant dean. As a concept, ‘comprehensive care’ has taken root in dental schools across the country in recent years. In practice, it involves creating a seamless experience for patients from the moment they enter the dental clinic, until treatment has been completed – everything from the initial evaluation to the final billing.\n\n1997-1998: Dentala dedicated to Greer\n\nThe Dentala was dedicated to Dr. David Greer: For his time listening to problems or triumphs whether personal or professional. For his interest in the student which extends from pre-dental training to private practice. For his for being a faculty member you can trust and count on. For making sure we are not just good clinicians, but also well-rounded individuals. For his friendship.\n\nMay 13, 1998: Capilouto named 6th dean\n\nDr. Mary Lynne Capilouto became the school’s 6th dean in 1998 after serving as interim dean beginning March 7, 1997 upon the retirement of Dean Matukas.\n\nMid 1998: Leadership, chairs and directors\n\nIn addition to Dean Mary Lynn Capilouto and associate deans Essie, Greer, and Palcanis, the school’s administration included the following chairs and directors: Dr. Donna Dixon (clinics), Dr. Steve Filler (admissions), Dr. David Koth (restorative), Dr. Milner Snuggs (operative), Dr. Jean O’Neal (prosthodontics), Dr. John Mills (endodontics), Dr. Peter Waite (oral surgery), Dr. Marjorie Jeffcoat (periodontics), Dr. Lionel Sadowski (orthodontics), Dr. Richard Weems (diagnostic sciences), Dr. Britta-Rahemtulla (community dentistry), Dr. Brad Roku (oral pathology), Dr. Ken Suggs (emergency clinic), Dr. Jack Lemons (biomaterials), Dr. John Thornton (pedodontics), Dr. Len Mueninghoff (graduate prosthodontics), Dr. J.R. Patel (radiology), and Dr. Ken Tilashalski (oral diagnosis).\n\nOctober 18, 1998: SOD celebrates 50th anniversary\n\nSchool hosts alumni and faculty event to celebrate 50 years.\n\nLate 1990s: Renovation transforms front of School of Dentistry Building and beyond\n\nFollowing minor renovations throughout the 1980s the SOD embarked upon a $35M+ major renovation in late 90’s. The renovation provides a state-of-the-art lecture and patient treatment rooms and preclinical laboratories. A new front entrance and atrium was also constructed in order to give the building – and the school – and more distinct art deco appearance. In addition, Hospital Dentistry was renovated in the 1990s and the preclinical dentistry (PCD) lab was renovated in 1999.\n\nAbout the 2000's\n\nLate 1990s – Early 2000s: Reorganization of academic departments\n\nDuring Dean Capilouto’s tenure, the school was reorganized into nine academic departments: Comprehensive Dentistry, Diagnostic Sciences, Endodontics & Pulp Biology, Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Biology, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Periodontology, and Prosthodontics & Biomaterials.\n\n1999-2000: Student activities\n\nStudent activities in the 1999-2000 academic year included the annual Carious Classic golf tournament, Student National Dental Association (SNDA), the Alabama Women’s Dental Association, and community service locally and around the world.\n\n2000: Phase I: SOD exterior/atrium renovation complete\n\nAnyone who has passed by the dental school recently has noticed striking changes – the orderly landscaping for instance, the airy new entrance, the spacious drop-off and pick-up point for patients. What the casual observer cannot know is that these physical improvements are meant to mirror the core philosophy of the school. “A compassionate approach to dentistry has always been an important part of the training we provide,” says Dean Mary Lynne Capilouto, D.M.D. “And so it made perfect sense for the first phase of our renovations to focus specifically on improving patients’ experience when they visit us. WE feel that by placing an emphasis on patient care, we encourage students to develop that attitude from the first day of their training.”\n\n2000: Phase II: PCD Lab renovation\n\nThe school’s newly-renovated preclinical dentistry lab is a state-of-the-art facility with an amazing array of high-tech features. This will be followed by Phase II: classroom renovations.\n\nJune 4, 2000: Honors Convocation\n\nHonors Convocation is held June 4, 2000. As her four years in dental school came to a close, Dentala editor Keri Miller wrote:\n\nAs our time here at Alabama comes to a close, I find myself not knowing whether I should cry out of utter joy or sadness… Each of our lives are a little bit better for having spent these years here. Someone once said, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” And while I was certain at times that this place would be the end of me, I realize that in the end there is nowhere else that I would rather been. Friendships have been made that will last a lifetime. Some have even found their husband or wife here. But no matter where life takes us, we will always be tied by the common bond of our noble profession. It has truly been a privilege to be part of such an impressive group.\n\n2000: SEARCH Program established\n\n12 student volunteers were chosen for the initial phase of a new statewide dental health program called SEARCH (Students/residents Experiences and Rotations in Community Health). Search team members help provide dental care to young, elderly, and disabled patients at seven community health centers around Alabama. UAB students, faculty, and alumni participate in the program, which is coordinated by the Alabama Department of Public Health.\n\n2000: International exchange programs\n\nAn early 2000s edition of Contact magazine highlighted the school’s rich history of international partnerships, including the Japan Exchange Program:\n\nContact with other cultures can change the way a person sees the world. Not only can it lead to an expanded sense of perspective, but also to greater tolerance for people’s differences. That’s what dental faculty and students at UAB gain by participating in the school’s long-standing foreign exchange program.\n\nBeginning with an alliance with the University of Iceland’s Department of Odontology that was established by founding Dean Joseph Volker, D.D.S., the School of Dentistry has established a tradition of creating relationships with other dental teaching institutions around the globe.\n\nDr. Steven Filler, D.D.S., who serves as assistant dean for student, alumni, and external affairs, organized the most recent student/faculty exchange between UAB and Japan. Ten students and two faculty members from Japan’s Asahi and Meikai universities visited the dental school in August. Their student and faculty hosts will visit Japan in the spring.\n\n2001: Resinous restorations\n\nUAB was instrumental in testing the belleClass HP head- and pressure-cured composite resin for restorations.\n\n2002: Advances in implantology\n\nUAB has a long history of implant advocacy, according to Jack Lemons, a professor in the Department of Prosthodontics and Biomaterials who worked with implants since the technology was introduced in the United States during eth 1970s. Lemons, along with such biomedical engineers as Linda Lucas, Ph.D., now dean of UAB School of Engineering, and Martha Warren Bidez, Ph.D. – then a UAB professor – stepped to the forefront of dental implant research. They helped establish a strong reputation for UAB’s Biomedical Implant Center, and since that time investigators have landed more than $20 million in grants and contracts. Bidez – who held joint appointments in the Schools of Engineering and Dentistry – eventually established a firm called BioHorizons through the Office for the Advancement of Developing Industries (OADI), UAB’s high-tech business incubator.\n\nMay 2002: Gilbert establishes first statewide PBRN\n\nThe School of dentistry is about to add some new lab space – 51,705 square miles, to be exact. The UAB SOD is turning the entire state of Alabama into a lab by asking the state’s 1,800 dentists for help in conducting research projects.\n\nAfter joining the faculty of the UAB School of Dentistry in 2000, Gregg Gilbert’s (DDS, MBA, FAAHD, FACD, FICD) interest in the field of oral health clinical research, including practice-based, oral epidemiology and dental behavioral sciences research led him to apply for UAB Health Services Foundation grant. With the resulting grant award, Gilbert established an Alabama practice-based research network (PBRN) that would become the nation’s first statewide dental PBRN. This would eventually develop into the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network.\n\n2002: Academic Career Club formed\n\nThe Academic Career Club was initiated in 2002 to support and provide guidance for students and faculty seeking a productive career in dental academics. It is intended to provide guidance to faculty, while affording a flavor of the academic life to student members interested in academic careers in dentistry. Programs are offered regularly and feature speakers on various aspects of academics, including practical information on such matters as constructing a curriculum vitae, career paths, ongoing the SOD clinical studies and grant opportunities.\n\nJanuary 15, 2003: Capilouto steps down as dean\n\nDr. Mary Lynne Capilouto, dean of the UAB School of Dentistry, is stepping down from her position. She will remain as dean while the university conducts a search for her successor and then will return to the faculty. Capilouto has served as dean since May 1998, after 15 months as interim dean.\n\nHighlights during Capilouto's tenure include:\n\nThe graduating class of 2002 ranked third in the nation on the National Dental Board Exam.\n\nUAB is the only site in the nation studying oral bone loss as part of the National Institutes of Health's comprehensive study of women's health issues.\n\nThe faculty and students participate in outreach programs not only in Alabama, but also in developing countries such as Cameroon and Guatemala.\n\nThe School of Dentistry has received a $10 million renovation and updating of clinical, research and teaching facilities.\n\nJune 7, 2003: Class of 2003 Commencement\n\nThe UAB School of Dentistry held its annual Honors Convocation and Hooding Ceremony for 54 graduating dentistry students of the class of 2003 on Saturday, June 7 at the Alys Robinson Stephens Performing Arts Center. Malcolm Portera, Ph.D., chancellor of the University of Alabama System, was the honored speaker. Portera has been chancellor of the UA System since 2002.\n\nUAB School of Dentistry, Class of 2003:\n\nMore than 10 percent of the graduating class will enter public health dentistry after graduation.\n\nThe rigorous four-year professional dentistry degree program consists of two years of basic sciences and pre-clinical dentistry classes and another two years of patient-based rotations in at least five dentistry specialties and a comprehensive-patient-care-based program where the students follow certain patients through a system of comprehensive care.\n\nStudents and faculty from the School of Dentistry are the leading provider of care to Medicaid patients in Alabama.\n\n2003: NIDCR research planning grant\n\nIn 2003, the school received a one-year planning grant from the NIDCR that helped the school evaluate and reorganize its research infrastructure. Changes that emerged from that planning process, including diversifying and collaborating on current research efforts, identification of key research focus areas, the addition of a new associate dean for research, Mary McDougall, PhD, and the eventual creation of the UAB Institute for Oral Health Research.\n\nAs a result, the school of dentistry’s research is concentrated in four main areas. These include dental practice research, which is study of how to provide the best health services to our patients; biomaterials and tissue engineering research, which includes the study of new materials for things like fillings, dental implants and tissue or tooth regeneration; microbiology and immunology, which includes the study of the development of immunity and infections in the oral cavity and how the body responds; and craniofacial development and biology, which includes the study of genetics, normal tissues of the face and head as related to genetic diseases and syndromes.\n\nJanuary 1, 2004: Thomas becomes 7th dean\n\nDr. Capilouto served as the dean until the end of December 2003 and was succeeded by Dr. Huw Thomas. Thomas, who came to UAB from the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio, became the School of Dentistry’s seventh dean on January 1, 2004.\n\nJanuary 2004: Greer lounge dedicated\n\nStudents at the School of Dentistry once again have a convenient place to spend some time away from the busy, sometimes chaotic world of dental school. After months of waiting for remodeling to be completed, the David Greer Student-Faculty Center was dedicated during Alumni Weekend in January. The completely refurbished lounge was named to honor a revered retired faculty member. “Dr. Greer is a long-standing friend of students, faculty, and alumni,” says Steven Filler, D.D.S., dean of student, alumni, and external affairs. “it was named out of respect for him and his relationship with the students who have gone through the school.” Since Greer says he always enjoyed the lounge himself, naming it for him is especially appropriate. And some of his favorite lounge traditions – such as the Hot Dog Lunches – have already resumed.\n\nJune 5, 2004: Dr. Eli Capilouoto speaks at Class of 2004 Commencement\n\nThe UAB School of Dentistry will hold its annual Honors Convocation and Hooding Ceremony for 56 graduating dentistry students of the class of 2004. The ceremonies will be held at the Alys Robinson Stephens Performing Arts Center. The honored speaker is Dr. Eli Capilouto, who is currently the Acting Provost at UAB and the former dean and professor at the UAB School of Public Health. A native Alabamian, he received his bachelors and dental degrees, and master’s degree in epidemiology from schools within the University of Alabama System. In 1991, he received his doctorate in health policy and management from the Harvard University School of Public Health.\n\nClass of 2004:\n\n36% of the graduating class for 2004 is female.\n\n13% of the graduating class will enter the Armed Forces.\n\n6% of the graduating class will enter Public Health Dentistry after graduation.\n\nApproximately 1/3 of the graduating class will pursue advanced dental training.\n\nThe rigorous four-year professional dentistry degree program consists of two years of basic sciences and pre-clinical dentistry classes and another two years of patient-based rotations in at least five dentistry specialties and a comprehensive-patient-care-based program where the students follow certain patients through a system of comprehensive care.\n\n2004: IOHR established, focus on research\n\nThe School of Dentistry’s “Powers That Be” – and, indeed, its entire research faculty – are known for spending a lot of time looking into the future, looking toward advancements in dental technologies and discoveries that will improve the dental health of Alabama and the world. But that vision now includes a School of Dentistry that stands at the forefront of those discoveries and leads the charge in advancing the cause of dental research. Hopes are high that the SOD will soon recapture – even exceed – its national research reputation of two decades ago. “This school was ranked number three in national funding,’ says Huw Thomas, B.D.S., M.S., Ph.D., dean of the School of Dentistry. “it had some of the leaders in dental research in the U.S. and the world.”\n\nEstablished in 2004, the Institute of Oral Health Research (IOHR) fosters expertise and excellence in oral health research. Focused on creating profound understanding of the biology and pathology of craniofacial tissues, its primary focus is on advancing oral health through active participation in basic science, translational, and clinical research.\n\nIOHR boasts robust research programs in areas such as skeletal development, epigenetics, oral cancer, microbiology and immunology, periodontal regeneration therapeutics, and clinical periodontics. The institute's overarching goal is to support researchers throughout their career trajectories. Members have access to top-notch university-wide facilities and resources that transcend departmental boundaries. Services include comprehensive support to faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows, facilitating collaborative efforts with various schools and colleges within UAB.\n\nFour themes are coordinated with in the IOHR under the direction of Mary MacDougall, Ph.D. Each clinical department will work with multiple themes, and each thematic area will represent several departments.\n\n“One of the major things we discovered from our planning grant was that we needed to take more advantage of the interdisciplinary and collaborative environment here at UAB,” said Gregg H. Gilbert, D.D.S., M.B.A., chairman of diagnostic sciences and principal investigator of the 2004 planning grant. “We are doing that now. Using UAB’s core facilities, interacting and collaborating on projects with faculty in other areas such as the schools of medicine, engineering and education, and establishing cross-campus partnerships have all helped the School of Dentistry become part of the milieu, and vastly improve our research.”\n\n2004-2008: Curriculum innovations\n\nAn overhaul and modernization of the school’s curriculum included vertical integration with early clinical experiences. The UAB School of dentistry has consistently ranked in the top 10 dental schools throughout the country. UAB dental students go on to successful careers in private practice, academia, and research. So why fix an educational program that wasn’t broken? The issue wasn’t that the traditional curriculum was bad – just that it could be improved, says associate dean for academic affairs Ken Tilashalski, D.M.D.\n\nThe school determined that providing clinical experiences for students as early as possible and emphasizing the connection between basic-sciences coursework and actual patient care would better serve them.\n\nHands-on from day one. The first-year Entry Level Clinical Skills (ELCS) course prepares students to enter the clinic nearly two years earlier than they would have under the traditional curriculum. The updated curriculum reorganizes basic-sciences courses into a systems-based approach. The systems-based classes are accompanied by the course Case-Based Education, where students apply their newly acquired knowledge to the context of clinical care. Ultimately, the graduating class of 2012 became the first class to graduate having experienced the new curriculum through their dental school careers.\n\nAugust 2005: Commitment to dental informatics\n\nMichelle Robinson, D.D.S., M.S., joined the faculty as assistant dean for dental informatics. Some of her goals included digitizing paper records, creating a new informatics course, offering informatics training for faculty, and to expand the school’s video capabilities to create continuing education programs that can be accessed via the internet.\n\nMarch 2006: UAB SOD leads nation as one of top 10 in research funding\n\nThe UAB School of Dentistry leapt from No. 19 to No. 10 in recently announced rankings based on fiscal 2005 funding by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). NIDCR is the primary sponsor of dental, oral, and craniofacial research and research training for the NIH. It released its rankings based on grants to U.S. academic and dental institutions in mid-March, ranking UAB as No. 10 in both categories, with a total of $6.95 million in funding.\n\n“This school was once ranked number four in national funding,” said Huw F. Thomas, B.D.S., M.D., Ph.D., dean of the UAB School of Dentistry. “It had some of the leaders in dental research in the U.S. and the world.” That standing slipped for a variety of reasons including gradual reduction in state funding, loss of key faculty members, national shortages of dental faculty and changes in funding approaches at the NIH. “But these current rankings illustrate we are well on our way to reclaiming our leadership position in research,” Thomas said. He added the school also is hoping for improvements in overall rankings based on total NIH funding, expected in June.\n\nThe changes in ranking reflect the school’s recent reorganization and receipt of three significant grants from the NIDCR, including one of the largest grants in the school’s history. UAB was the only school in the nation to receive all three of these major grants from NIDCR. In 2003, the school received a one-year planning grant from the NIDCR that helped the school evaluate and reorganize its research infrastructure. Changes that emerged from that planning process, including diversifying and collaborating on current research efforts, identification of key research focus areas, the addition of a new associate dean for research and the creation of the UAB Institute for Oral Health Research, all helped paved the road.\n\nSeptember 20, 2006: O’Neal presented UAB achievement in teaching award\n\nProfessor Sandra Jean O’Neal, D.M.D., has been named this year’s recipient of the Ellen Gregg Ingalls/UAB National Alumni Society Award for Lifetime Achievement in Teaching. The award is presented annually to a full-time, regular faculty member who has demonstrated outstanding dedication to teaching throughout his or her UAB career. Nominees must be past winners of the UAB President’s Award for Excellence in Teaching, which O’Neal received in 1995.\n\nO’Neal is being recognized for her commitment to dental education. She serves as chair of the UAB Department of Prosthodontics, a position she has held since 1998. She has published numerous scientific abstracts and articles, and has been very active in clinical research, especially dealing with esthetic restorative dentistry and implantology. She holds memberships in the American College of Prosthodontists, the American College of Dentistry and the Academy of Dentistry International.\n\nO’Neal earned her dental degree in 1977, a certificate in fixed prosthodontics in 1979 and a Master of Science in Dentistry in 1980 from the UAB School of Dentistry. She has been a member of the School of Dentistry faculty since 1980.\n\n2006 - 2008: Renovation of research facilities\n\nWith a renewed commitment to research, the 7th floor research area renovated in 2006 and the 8th floor research area was renovated in 2008.\n\n2007: UAB DART program begins\n\nOfficially known as the Dental Academic Research Training program, DART is an interdisciplinary training program supported by the National Institutes for Health (NIH) National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). The UAB DART program was established in 2007 as a T32 grant.\n\nFebruary 23, 2008: SOD serves community through Give Kids a Smile\n\nAbout half of kids from low-income families suffer from dental disease, yet they are the least likely to visit a dentist regularly, according to the American Dental Association (ADA). Hundreds of these kids will be all smiles Feb. 23 during Give Kids a Smile (GKAS) Day at the UAB School of Dentistry. Dentists and volunteers will provide free screenings and cleanings to hundreds of uninsured, underserved children from central Alabama during the annual event.\n\n“Through GKAS, we are able to provide screenings and cleanings to kids who do not have access to routine dental care,” said Stephen C. Mitchell, D.M.D., UAB pediatric dentist and chair of the UAB GKAS Committee. “We also provide referrals if additional treatment is necessary, so GKAS Day is sort of a launching pad for good oral health.”\n\nDuring the event, dentists and volunteers educate parents on the importance of good oral hygiene at an early age so they can pass it on to their children. The underserved children have been identified by Blue Cross Blue Shield and recruited by the United Way of Central Alabama. The UAB School of Dentistry, the Birmingham District Dental Society (BDDS), the United Way of Central Alabama and the American Dental Association (ADA) have helped sponsor this event.\n\nJune 2, 2008: Recent ADA president speaks to 2008 graduates\n\nThe immediate past president of the American Dental Association (ADA) on Saturday encouraged UAB graduating dentistry students to stay involved and connected in their communities, and to seek leadership roles in volunteer boards and public-health initiatives. Kathleen Roth, D.D.S., was the featured speaker at UAB's School of Dentistry annual diploma and hooding ceremony for the 52 graduating students in the class of 2008. The ceremony was May 31st at the Alys Stephens Center on campus.\n\nOctober 10, 2008: SOD serves community, participates in minority health & wellness day\n\nThe UAB Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center, along with Lawson State Community College and the Friends of West End, hosted a Community Health and Wellness Day Wednesday, Oct. 15, at Lawson State Community College, Birmingham Campus. Continuing its commitment to community service, the SOD was among other schools and organizations offering health screenings and wellness information.\n\nOctober 16, 2008: SOD celebrates UAB Homecoming\n\nThe SOD celebrated UAB Homecoming 2008 by hosting its annual Student Pizza Luncheon in the Student Faculty Center, Room 639.\n\nJanuary 29, 2009: Dental student wins UAB diversity award\n\nUAB dental student Cramin P. Wiltz II is the winner of the President's Diversity Professional Student Award. Dean Huw Thomas credited Wiltz for playing an important role in the mentoring and recruitment of underrepresented minorities to the School of Dentistry. Thomas said Wiltz has spoken at local high schools, colleges and health and church fairs about dentistry as a career. Wiltz has been a member of the School of Dentistry's Minority Recruitment Task Force, and he presented a proposal for a UAB Summer Pre-Dental Enrichment Program at the annual American Dental Association meeting in San Francisco in 2007. Also that year, he was a student representative at the National Dental Association's annual \"Day on Capitol Hill\" in Washington D.C., where he met with congressional staff members to discuss the challenges of recruiting minority students to health careers and about pending legislation affecting dental education.\n\nJune 4, 2009: BioHorizons Clinical Research Facility opens\n\nThe SOD announces the opening of a state-of-the-art clinic offering the latest in restorative, implant and cosmetic dentistry. The new BioHorizons Clinical Research Facility is located in the school's 6th floor and is managed by John Burgess, D.D.S., UAB's assistant dean for dental clinical research. Project funds and equipment installation came from BioHorizons Inc., a Birmingham-based oral reconstructive device company, and from various donors. The clinic has been designed as a multi-use facility housing research projects to evaluate implants, crowns, new ceramic materials, digital impression devices and the latest dental materials. BioHorizons was founded in 1994 as a spin-off enterprise from UAB. The company has since become one of the nation's largest implant manufacturers.\n\nAbout the 2010's\n\nJune 2010: SOD student chosen as global health scholar\n\nThree University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) graduate students, including Natasha Varma, a doctoral dental medicine candidate in the UAB School of Dentistry, have been selected for the prestigious Fogarty International Clinical Research Scholars program. They join top students and post-doctoral trainees from across the United States and 19 other nations who will train for global health research in low- and middle-income areas of the world. Varma, of Mobile, was selected to pursue her Fogarty fellowship at the Public Health Foundation of India in New Delhi. She will work under the mentorship of Dorairaj Prabhakaran M.D., D.M., M.Sc., and Nikhil Tandon, M.D., both faculty members of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, India. She will also work under the mentorship of K.M. Venkat Narayan, M.D., M.Sc., M.B.A., and Mohammed K. Ali, M.B.Ch.B., M.Sc., both faculty members at Emory University in Atlanta. Varma's UAB School of Dentistry faculty mentor is Mary MacDougall, Ph.D.\n\nNovember 2010: SOD hosts UAB homecoming events\n\nThe SOD hosted its annual Student Pizza Luncheon at noon in the David F. Greer Student-Faculty Center on Nov. 2 and 4. The school hosted a Staff Homecoming Celebration in Greer on Nov. 3.\n\nJune 2011: Reddy assumes interim dean position\n\nMichael S. Reddy, D.M.D., D.M.Sc., was named interim dean of the school beginning June 2011.\n\nMarch 15, 2012: Reddy named 8th dean\n\nMichael S. Reddy, D.M.D., D.M.Sc., an internationally respected specialist in periodontics, has been named dean of the UAB School of Dentistry. His appointment is effective March 15, 2012. Reddy was chair of the UAB Department of Periodontology from 2004 to 2011 and is the former assistant dean for Planning and Clinical Activity. He also is a senior scientist in multiple UAB research centers, including the centers for Metabolic Bone Disease and Aging.\n\n2012: SOD receives grant to create a national dental practice-based research network\n\nSOD receives seven-year, $66.8-million NIDCR grant to create a national dental practice-based research network, consolidating the institute’s former three regional research networks into a single, nationally coordinated effort. It is housed in the UAB Department of Clinical and Community Sciences under the leadership of Gregg Gilbert, D.D.S, M.B.A. The school received $9,976,266 for the project in 2012.\n\n2012: DART funded at T90/R90 grant\n\nThe UAB DART program was established in 2007 as a T32 grant, which was transitioned to a T90/R90 NIDCR grant in 2012.\n\n2012: SOD launches branding campaign\n\nPart of its strategic plan, the School of Dentistry launched a branding campaign that included a new website, light pole flags in front of the school, and promotional products.\n\nSpring 2013: UAB and SOD ranked first nationally in NIDCR funding\n\nThe UAB School of Dentistry leapt from No. 15 to No. 1 in recently announced rankings based on 2012 funding to dental schools and academic institutions in the country by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), one of the National Institutes of Health.
