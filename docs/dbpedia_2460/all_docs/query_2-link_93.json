        "text": "When you are gathering book sources, be sure to make note of the following bibliographic items: the author name(s), other contributors such as translators or editors, the book’s title, editions of the book, the publication date, the publisher, and the pagination.\n\nThe 8th edition of the MLA handbook highlights principles over prescriptive practices. Essentially, a writer will need to take note of primary elements in every source, such as author, title, etc. and then assort them in a general format. Thus, by using this methodology, a writer will be able to cite any source regardless of whether it’s included in this list.\n\nPlease note these changes in the new edition:\n\nCommas are used instead of periods between Publisher, Publication Date, and Pagination.\n\nMedium is no longer necessary.\n\nContainers are now a part of the MLA process. Commas should be used after container titles.\n\nDOIs should be used instead of URLS when available.\n\nUse the term “Accessed” instead of listing the date or the abbreviation, “n.d.\"\n\nBelow is the general format for any citation:\n\nBasic Book Format\n\nThe author’s name or a book with a single author's name appears in last name, first name format. The basic form for a book citation is:\n\nLast Name, First Name. Title of Book. City of Publication, Publisher, Publication Date.\n\n*Note: the City of Publication should only be used if the book was published before 1900, if the publisher has offices in more than one country, or if the publisher is unknown in North America.\n\nBook with One Author\n\nGleick, James. Chaos: Making a New Science. Penguin, 1987.\n\nHenley, Patricia. The Hummingbird House. MacMurray, 1999.\n\nBook with More Than One Author\n\nWhen a book has two authors, order the authors in the same way they are presented in the book. Start by listing the first name that appears on the book in last name, first name format; subsequent author names appear in normal order (first name last name format).\n\nGillespie, Paula, and Neal Lerner. The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Peer Tutoring. Allyn and Bacon, 2000.\n\nIf there are three or more authors, list only the first author followed by the phrase et al. (Latin for \"and others\") in place of the subsequent authors' names. (Note that there is a period after “al” in “et al.” Also note that there is never a period after the “et” in “et al.”).\n\nWysocki, Anne Frances, et al. Writing New Media: Theory and Applications for Expanding the Teaching of Composition. Utah State UP, 2004.\n\nTwo or More Books by the Same Author\n\nList works alphabetically by title. (Remember to ignore articles like A, An, and The.) Provide the author’s name in last name, first name format for the first entry only. For each subsequent entry by the same author, use three hyphens and a period.\n\nPalmer, William J. Dickens and New Historicism. St. Martin's, 1997.\n\n---. The Films of the Eighties: A Social History. Southern Illinois UP, 1993.\n\nBook by a Corporate Author or Organization\n\nA corporate author may include a commission, a committee, a government agency, or a group that does not identify individual members on the title page.\n\nList the names of corporate authors in the place where an author’s name typically appears at the beginning of the entry.\n\nAmerican Allergy Association. Allergies in Children. Random House, 1998.\n\nWhen the author and publisher are the same, skip the author, and list the title first. Then, list the corporate author only as the publisher.\n\nFair Housing—Fair Lending. Aspen Law & Business, 1985.\n\nBook with No Author\n\nList by title of the book. Incorporate these entries alphabetically just as you would with works that include an author name. For example, the following entry might appear between entries of works written by Dean, Shaun and Forsythe, Jonathan.\n\nEncyclopedia of Indiana. Somerset, 1993.\n\nRemember that for an in-text (parenthetical) citation of a book with no author, you should provide the name of the work in the signal phrase and the page number in parentheses. You may also use a shortened version of the title of the book accompanied by the page number. For more information see the In-text Citations for Print Sources with No Known Author section of In-text Citations: The Basics.\n\nA Translated Book\n\nIf you want to emphasize the work rather than the translator, cite as you would any other book. Add “translated by” and follow with the name(s) of the translator(s).\n\nFoucault, Michel. Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason. Translated by Richard Howard, Vintage-Random House, 1988.\n\nIf you want to focus on the translation, list the translator as the author. In place of the author’s name, the translator’s name appears. His or her name is followed by the label, “translator.” If the author of the book does not appear in the title of the book, include the name, with a “By” after the title of the book and before the publisher. Note that this type of citation is less common and should only be used for papers or writing in which translation plays a central role.\n\nHoward, Richard, translator. Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason. By Michel Foucault, Vintage-Random House, 1988.\n\nRepublished Book\n\nBooks may be republished due to popularity without becoming a new edition. New editions are typically revisions of the original work. For books that originally appeared at an earlier date and that have been republished at a later one, insert the original publication date before the publication information.\n\nFor books that are new editions (i.e. different from the first or other editions of the book), see An Edition of a Book below.\n\nButler, Judith. Gender Trouble. 1990. Routledge, 1999.\n\nErdrich, Louise. Love Medicine. 1984. Perennial-Harper, 1993.\n\nAn Edition of a Book\n\nThere are two types of editions in book publishing: a book that has been published more than once in different editions and a book that is prepared by someone other than the author (typically an editor).\n\nA Subsequent Edition\n\nCite the book as you normally would, but add the number of the edition after the title.\n\nCrowley, Sharon, and Debra Hawhee. Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students. 3rd ed., Pearson, 2004.\n\nA Work Prepared by an Editor\n\nCite the book as you normally would, but add the editor after the title with the label \"edited by.\"\n\nBronte, Charlotte. Jane Eyre, edited by Margaret Smith, Oxford UP, 1998.\n\nNote that the format for citing sources with important contributors with editor-like roles follows the same basic template:\n\n...adapted by John Doe...\n\nFinally, in the event that the source features a contributor that cannot be described with a past-tense verb and the word \"by\" (e.g., \"edited by\"), you may instead use a noun followed by a comma, like so:\n\n...guest editor, Jane Smith...\n\nAnthology or Collection (e.g. Collection of Essays)\n\nTo cite the entire anthology or collection, list by editor(s) followed by a comma and \"editor\" or, for multiple editors, \"editors.\" This sort of entry is somewhat rare. If you are citing a particular piece within an anthology or collection (more common), see A Work in an Anthology, Reference, or Collection below.\n\nHill, Charles A., and Marguerite Helmers, editors. Defining Visual Rhetorics. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004.\n\nPeterson, Nancy J., editor. Toni Morrison: Critical and Theoretical Approaches. Johns Hopkins UP, 1997.\n\nA Work in an Anthology, Reference, or Collection\n\nWorks may include an essay in an edited collection or anthology, or a chapter of a book. The basic form is for this sort of citation is as follows:\n\nLast name, First name. \"Title of Essay.\" Title of Collection, edited by Editor's Name(s), Publisher, Year, Page range of entry.\n\nSome examples:\n\nHarris, Muriel. \"Talk to Me: Engaging Reluctant Writers.\" A Tutor's Guide: Helping Writers One to One, edited by Ben Rafoth, Heinemann, 2000, pp. 24-34.\n\nSwanson, Gunnar. \"Graphic Design Education as a Liberal Art: Design and Knowledge in the University and The 'Real World.'\" The Education of a Graphic Designer, edited by Steven Heller, Allworth Press, 1998, pp. 13-24.\n\nNote on Cross-referencing Several Items from One Anthology: If you cite more than one essay from the same edited collection, MLA indicates you may cross-reference within your works cited list in order to avoid writing out the publishing information for each separate essay. You should consider this option if you have several references from a single text. To do so, include a separate entry for the entire collection listed by the editor's name as below:\n\nRose, Shirley K, and Irwin Weiser, editors. The Writing Program Administrator as Researcher. Heinemann, 1999.\n\nThen, for each individual essay from the collection, list the author's name in last name, first name format, the title of the essay, the editor's last name, and the page range:\n\nL'Eplattenier, Barbara. \"Finding Ourselves in the Past: An Argument for Historical Work on WPAs.\" Rose and Weiser, pp. 131-40.\n\nPeeples, Tim. \"'Seeing' the WPA With/Through Postmodern Mapping.\" Rose and Weiser, pp. 153-67.\n\nPlease note: When cross-referencing items in the works cited list, alphabetical order should be maintained for the entire list.\n\nPoem or Short Story Examples:\n\nBurns, Robert. \"Red, Red Rose.\" 100 Best-Loved Poems, edited by Philip Smith, Dover, 1995, p. 26.\n\nKincaid, Jamaica. \"Girl.\" The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories, edited by Tobias Wolff, Vintage, 1994, pp. 306-07.\n\nIf the specific literary work is part of the author's own collection (all of the works have the same author), then there will be no editor to reference:\n\nWhitman, Walt. \"I Sing the Body Electric.\" Selected Poems, Dover, 1991, pp. 12-19.\n\nCarter, Angela. \"The Tiger's Bride.\" Burning Your Boats: The Collected Stories, Penguin, 1995, pp. 154-69.\n\nArticle in a Reference Book (e.g. Encyclopedias, Dictionaries)\n\nFor entries in encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other reference works, cite the entry name as you would any other work in a collection but do not include the publisher information. Also, if the reference book is organized alphabetically, as most are, do not list the volume or the page number of the article or item.\n\n\"Ideology.\" The American Heritage Dictionary. 3rd ed. 1997.\n\nA Multivolume Work\n\nWhen citing only one volume of a multivolume work, include the volume number after the work's title, or after the work's editor or translator.\n\nQuintilian. Institutio Oratoria. Translated by H. E. Butler, vol. 2, Loeb-Harvard UP, 1980.\n\nWhen citing more than one volume of a multivolume work, cite the total number of volumes in the work. Also, be sure in your in-text citation to provide both the volume number and page number(s) (see \"Citing Multivolume Works\" on our in-text citations resource.)\n\nQuintilian. Institutio Oratoria. Translated by H. E. Butler, Loeb-Harvard UP, 1980. 4 vols.\n\nIf the volume you are using has its own title, cite the book without referring to the other volumes as if it were an independent publication.\n\nChurchill, Winston S. The Age of Revolution. Dodd, 1957.\n\nAn Introduction, Preface, Foreword, or Afterword\n\nWhen citing an introduction, a preface, a foreword, or an afterword, write the name of the author(s) of the piece you are citing. Then give the name of the part being cited, which should not be italicized or enclosed in quotation marks; in italics, provide the name of the work and the name of the author of the introduction/preface/foreword/afterword. Finish the citation with the details of publication and page range.\n\nFarrell, Thomas B. Introduction. Norms of Rhetorical Culture, by Farrell, Yale UP, 1993, pp. 1-13.\n\nIf the writer of the piece is different from the author of the complete work, then write the full name of the principal work's author after the word \"By.\" For example, if you were to cite Hugh Dalziel Duncan’s introduction of Kenneth Burke’s book Permanence and Change, you would write the entry as follows:\n\nDuncan, Hugh Dalziel. Introduction. Permanence and Change: An Anatomy of Purpose, by Kenneth Burke, 1935, 3rd ed., U of California P, 1984, pp. xiii-xliv.\n\nBook Published Before 1900\n\nOriginal copies of books published before 1900 are usually defined by their place of publication rather than the publisher. Unless you are using a newer edition, cite the city of publication where you would normally cite the publisher.\n\nThoreau, Henry David. Excursions. Boston, 1863.\n\nThe Bible\n\nItalicize “The Bible” and follow it with the version you are using. Remember that your in-text (parenthetical citation) should include the name of the specific edition of the Bible, followed by an abbreviation of the book, the chapter and verse(s). (See Citing the Bible at In-Text Citations: The Basics.)\n\nThe Bible. Authorized King James Version, Oxford UP, 1998.\n\nThe Bible. The New Oxford Annotated Version, 3rd ed., Oxford UP, 2001.\n\nThe New Jerusalem Bible. Edited by Susan Jones, Doubleday, 1985.\n\nA Government Publication\n\nCite the author of the publication if the author is identified. Otherwise, start with the name of the national government, followed by the agency (including any subdivisions or agencies) that serves as the organizational author. For congressional documents, be sure to include the number of the Congress and the session when the hearing was held or resolution passed as well as the report number. US government documents are typically published by the Government Printing Office.\n\nUnited States, Congress, Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Hearing on the Geopolitics of Oil. Government Printing Office, 2007. 110th Congress, 1st session, Senate Report 111-8.\n\nUnited States, Government Accountability Office. Climate Change: EPA and DOE Should Do More to Encourage Progress Under Two Voluntary Programs. Government Printing Office, 2006.\n\nA Pamphlet\n\nCite the title and publication information for the pamphlet just as you would a book without an author. Pamphlets and promotional materials commonly feature corporate authors (commissions, committees, or other groups that does not provide individual group member names). If the pamphlet you are citing has no author, cite as directed below. If your pamphlet has an author or a corporate author, put the name of the author (last name, first name format) or corporate author in the place where the author name typically appears at the beginning of the entry. (See also Books by a Corporate Author or Organization above.)\n\nWomen's Health: Problems of the Digestive System. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2006.\n\nYour Rights Under California Welfare Programs. California Department of Social Services, 2007.\n\nDissertations and Master's Theses\n\nDissertations and master's theses may be used as sources whether published or not. Unlike previous editions, MLA 8 specifies no difference in style for published/unpublished works.\n\nThe main elements of a dissertation citation are the same as those for a book: author name(s), title (italicized), and publication date. Conclude with an indication of the document type (e.g., \"PhD dissertation\"). The degree-granting institution may be included before the document type (though this is not required). If the dissertation was accessed through an online repository, include it as the second container after all the other elements.\n\nBishop, Karen Lynn. Documenting Institutional Identity: Strategic Writing in the IUPUI Comprehensive Campaign. 2002. Purdue University, PhD dissertation."
