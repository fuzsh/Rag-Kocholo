        "text": "“It is certainly the case that violence against women is very often a manifestation of wider social problems, but there is absolutely no excuse for it, and I think it sends a powerful message when more and more men are prepared to stand up and say they are against it on White Ribbon Day.”\n\nTOM CALMA AO White Ribbon Ambassador\n\nAs an Aboriginal woman you are 45 times more likely to experience domestic violence than a white woman.\n\nRead more:\n\nIt is important to understand how every act of male violence against women can have serious effects on women, families and society as a whole.\n\nMale violence against women can happen anywhere and can take many forms; including physical, sexual, emotional and financial violence and has a profound cost across the personal, social and economic sphere.\n\nPicture above Stop the Violence march Congress Aboriginal Health Alice Springs 2010\n\nWhite Ribbon Australia is uncovering the nation’s most shameful secret; the extent of male violence against women, which claims at least one woman’s life every week[1]. Australia, land of secrets is a new awareness raising campaign launched in the lead up to White Ribbon Day, Monday 25 November.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nAustralia, land of secrets intends to give a voice to the everyday experiences of violence that occur all around Australia. These acts, from inappropriate behaviour or harassment to physical and emotional abuse, are part of a culture of violence in Australia.\n\nChairman of White Ribbon Australia, Lt. Gen Ken Gillespie (Rtd) says that while Australia is a proud nation and unrivalled for not only its physical beauty but its way of life, it has a dark secret.\n\n“The high incidence of male violence against women in this country is very alarming,” said Ken. “Not only do one in three women over the age of 15 report having experienced physical or sexual violence at some time in their lives,[2] violence is a major cause of homelessness for women and children[3] and costs the economy US$14.7 billion annually in Australia.[4]”\n\n“It is important to understand how every act of male violence against women can have serious effects on women, families and society as a whole. Male violence against women can happen anywhere and can take many forms; including physical, sexual, emotional and financial violence and has a profound cost across the personal, social and economic sphere.\n\n“The issue of male violence against women is real, it’s worrying and, in many instances, remains hidden. Every woman, and man, can make a stand and speak up about the issue. Australia, land of secrets calls on men, women and the whole community to help uncover Australia’s secrets, raise awareness and stop violence against women.”\n\nThis White Ribbon Day, Monday 25 November, White Ribbon Australia is encouraging people to speak up and uncover stories of violence against women. Australia, land of secrets brings a new creative element to Australia’s only national male-led campaign to end men’s violence against women in its 10th Anniversary year.\n\nWhite Ribbon Australia will be hosting awareness and fundraising events across the country throughout November. Australians are encouraged to participate in the many events happening in their local area, and to donate to show their support of the campaign.\n\nHistory: 2008 Inteyerrkwe Statement Apology to women\n\nNearly 400 Aboriginal men took part in the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Aboriginal Male Health gathering in the NT and issued the Inteyerrkwe Statement, an apology from men to women for violence and abuse.\n\nInteyerrkwe Statement\n\n“We the Aboriginal males from Central Australia and our visitor brothers from around Australia gathered at Inteyerrkwe in July 2008 to develop strategies to ensure our future roles as grandfathers, fathers, uncles, nephews, brothers, grandsons, and sons in caring for our children in a safe family environment that will lead to a happier, longer life that reflects opportunities experienced by the wider community.\n\nWe acknowledge and say sorry for the hurt, pain and suffering caused by Aboriginal males to our wives, to our children, to our mothers, to our grandmothers, to our granddaughters, to our aunties, to our nieces and to our sisters.\n\nWe also acknowledge that we need the love and support of our Aboriginal women to help us move forward.”\n\nNACCHO members such as ANYINGINYI are taking an active role in White Ribbon Day\n\nFor more information visit www.whiteribbon.org.au.\n\nFollow this link to view and share the new TVC: www.uncoversecrets.com.au\n\nHOW THE COMMUNITY CAN SUPPORT WHITE RIBBON DAY\n\nWhite Ribbon invites people to show their support for White Ribbon Day by hosting or attending one of the many White Ribbon events that take place across Australia (www.whiteribbon.org.au/events), sharing the campaign online (www.whiteribbon.org.au/secrets) or purchasing White Ribbon wristbands and ribbons at any Suzanne Grae, The Salvation Army (QLD, NSW, ACT) stores or the White Ribbon shop (www.whiteribbon.org.au/shop).\n\n—————————–ends—————————–\n\nRelated articles"
