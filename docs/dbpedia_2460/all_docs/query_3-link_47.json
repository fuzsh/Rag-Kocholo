        "text": "Incidence refers to the number of new cases identified in a specific time period.\n\nPrevalence refers to the number of individuals who are living with TBI in a given time period.\n\nGeneral Statistics\n\nWorldwide, in 2016, there were approximately 27 million new cases of TBI with an age-adjusted incidence rate of 369 per 100,000—representing a 3.6% increase from 1990. In the same year, prevalence was 55.5 million individuals, representing an 8.4% increase from 1990 (Global Burden of Disease [GBD], 2019). Each year, the number of new cases of TBI in the Unites States is approximately 2.8 million (CDC, 2015). These incidence rates include approximately 2.5 million TBI-related emergency department visits, 288,000 TBI-related hospitalizations, and 57,000 TBI-related deaths. Whereas age-adjusted rates of TBI-related ED visits increased by 54% over the span of 8 years (2006–2014), hospitalization rates decreased by 8% and death rates decreased by 6% (CDC, 2014).\n\nAccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, an estimated cumulative 5.3 million individuals are living with a TBI-related disability in the United States. This represents a prevalence of approximately 2% of the U.S. population (CDC, 2015). Additional data suggest the prevalence of U.S. TBI-related disability after hospitalization to be 3.2 million (Zaloshnja, Miller, Langlois, & Selassie, 2008). Current studies estimate that approximately 775,000 older adults live with long-term disability associated with TBI (Zaloshnja et al., 2008).\n\nIncidence and prevalence rates of TBI vary across clinical and epidemiological studies. These variations are often due to differences in participant characteristics (e.g., ages included), diagnostic classification criteria within and across subtypes (e.g., mild TBI vs. severe TBI), and sources of data (e.g., hospital admissions, emergency room visits, general practitioner visits). Moreover, current statistics do not consider individuals who do not seek medical care. Therefore, these estimates may significantly underestimate the incidence and prevalence of TBI.\n\nGender\n\nThe TBI prevalence in the general population is 16.7% among males and 8.5% among females. The odds of sustaining a TBI are 2.22 times higher in men than in women (Frost, Farrer, Primosch, & Hedges, 2012). Overall, males account for approximately 59% of all reported TBI-related medical visits in the United States (Faul, Xu, Wald, & Coronado, 2010).\n\nSeverity\n\nAs many as 75% of individuals who experience a TBI are diagnosed with mild TBI. This is likely an underestimate of the problem, as patients with mild TBI—who are often treated outside the hospital setting or are not treated at all—are not included in most estimates. In addition, this number includes only mild TBIs in the civilian population (CDC, 2003). It is believed that factors such as automobile safety, seatbelt use, helmet use, and better overall treatment for severe TBI in prehospital and hospital settings, while unable to prevent TBIs entirely, have mitigated the severity and thus mortality (Thurman et al., 1999).\n\nSee the Assessment section of the Traumatic Brain Injury (Adults) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nSLPs and audiologists do not diagnose TBI. However, they need to understand the individual's medical assessment, physical condition, course of recovery, and nature of the neurological damage to guide development of an appropriate assessment plan (Hegde, 2018).\n\nAssessment of individuals with TBI requires collaboration with the individual and their family members, medical professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and other professionals. Findings from the speech-language and audiology assessments are considered in the context of findings from other professionals on the team. See ASHA's web page on interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP) and ASHA's resources on person- and family-centered care, and collaboration and teaming.\n\nAssessments are conducted in the language(s) used by the person with TBI, with the use of translation/interpretation services as necessary. Assessments are sensitive to cultural and linguistic variables. See ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology and Cultural Responsiveness, and Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators.\n\nScreening\n\nSee the Screening section of the Traumatic Brain Injury (Adults) Evidence Map for relevant evidence, expert opinion, and client/patient perspective.\n\nAudiologists and SLPs conduct screening to identify possible deficits following a TBI. Screening is typically completed prior to conducting more comprehensive evaluations. Screening does not provide a detailed description of the severity and characteristics of deficits resulting from TBI but, rather, identifies the need for further assessment.\n\nAudiologic Screening\n\nHearing screening and otoscopic inspection for impacted cerumen occur prior to screening for other deficits. If the individual wears hearing aids, an audiologist should inspect the hearing aids to ensure that they are in working order, and the individual should wear the hearing aids during screening. Hearing screening is within the scope of practice for SLPs. See ASHA's Practice Portal page on Adult Hearing Screenings.\n\nReferral for a full audiologic evaluation is necessary if the individual fails the hearing screening or if hearing loss is suspected. Audiologists may also screen for tinnitus and vestibular deficits as indicated. See ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Hearing Loss in Adults, Tinnitus and Hyperacusis, and Balance System Disorders.\n\nSpeech, Language, Cognitive-Communication, and Swallowing Screening\n\nSLPs screen for speech, language, cognitive-communication, and swallowing deficits using appropriate standardized instruments or nonstandardized procedures. A referral is made for comprehensive assessment in one or more of these areas if the individual fails that portion of the screening.\n\nComprehensive Assessment\n\nThe purpose of a comprehensive assessment for individuals with TBI is to determine speech, language, cognitive-communication, swallowing, and audiologic strengths and needs.\n\nIf an individual wears prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids, and prescriptions are still appropriate post injury, then they should wear the glasses or aids during assessment.\n\nIf the TBI resulted in additional hearing or visual deficits, then sensory aids and/or accommodations used before the injury may not be sufficient. Physical or environmental modifications may be needed (e.g., large-print material, modified lighting, amplification devices).\n\nIf changes to premorbid hearing and/or vision are significant, then the individual is referred for comprehensive audiologic and/or vision assessments prior to any additional testing. See the Assessment section of ASHA's Practice Portal page on Hearing Loss in Adults.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (ASHA, 2016; WHO, 2001), ongoing comprehensive assessment of individuals with TBI is conducted to identify and describe the following:\n\nImpairments in body structure and function, including underlying strengths and weaknesses in areas known to be affected by TBI.\n\nLimitations in activities and participation, including functional communication, interpersonal interactions, self-care, and resuming their preinjury roles.\n\nImpact of communication impairments on quality of life, functional limitations relative to premorbid social roles, and the impact on their community.\n\nContextual (environmental and personal) factors that serve as barriers to, or facilitators of, successful communication and life participation. These can include the following:\n\nFacilitators—ability and willingness to use compensatory strategies for day-to-day communication and in the classroom; family support; motivation to improve function.\n\nBarriers—decreased confidence in one's ability to communicate; presence of cognitive deficits; visual and motor impairments; lack of awareness of disability.\n\nSee the ASHA resource titled Person-Centered Focus on Function: Traumatic Brain Injury [PDF] for an example of assessment data consistent with ICF.\n\nAssessment Methods/Procedures\n\nAssessment protocols can include both standardized and nonstandardized tools and data sources. See ASHA's resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources. The decision to use standardized or nonstandardized tools is based upon a variety of factors, including the needs of the person with TBI, the complexity of impairment, payer rules, and facility policy.\n\nStandardized Assessment—Currently, there are few standardized communication assessments for use with individuals TBI. When selecting a standardized assessment tool, clinicians consider\n\nthe severity of the underlying neurological damage;\n\nthe individual's level of alertness;\n\nthe presence of comorbid physical, sensory, and cognitive deficits; and\n\ncultural and linguistic representation in the norming population.\n\nTests that are too difficult for individuals with severe deficits will not yield useful information. In addition to selecting tests that assess the targeted areas of deficit, clinicians must also evaluate if the tests selected have been normed for use with TBI.\n\nNonstandardized Assessment—Functional nonstandardized assessments are particularly valuable because individuals with TBI often perform disproportionately better or worse in activities of daily living compared with abilities predicted by standardized test scores.\n\nNonstandardized assessment procedures serve a variety of purposes, including identifying\n\nthe individual's abilities in domains for which there are no, or limited, standardized tests;\n\nthe individual's abilities within functional contexts and activities of daily living;\n\nstrategies and task modifications to maximize the individual's functional abilities in various communication contexts;\n\nhelpful information for communication partners; and\n\noutcomes in response to intervention (Coelho, Ylvisaker, & Turkstra, 2005).\n\nComprehensive Speech-Language Assessment: Typical Components\n\nCase History\n\nNature and onset of TBI and related hospitalizations\n\nMedical status—current and prior to injury\n\nCurrent medications\n\nReview of auditory, visual, motor, and cognitive status\n\nReview of emotional and mental status\n\nEducational and occupational background\n\nReported areas of concern (e.g., memory, speaking, swallowing) and contexts of concern (e.g., social interactions, work activities)\n\nLanguage(s) used in contexts of concern\n\nImpact of current condition on the individual and their family/caregivers\n\nGoals and priorities of the individual and their family/caregivers\n\nNonspeech Examination\n\nIntegrity of speech subsystems (respiration, phonation, oral articulators)\n\nStrength, speed, and range of motion of the oral–motor system components\n\nSequential/alternating movement repetitions (diadochokinesis)\n\nSteadiness, tone, and accuracy of movements for speech and nonspeech tasks\n\nSpeech Production\n\nVocal quality and ability to change loudness and pitch (see ASHA's Practice Portal page on Voice Disorders)\n\nStress testing—2 to 4 minutes of reading or speaking aloud to assess deterioration over time to determine if dysarthria is present (see ASHA's Practice Portal page on Dysarthria in Adults)\n\nMotor speech planning or programming—repetition of simple and complex multisyllabic words and sentences to determine if apraxia of speech (AOS) is present (see ASHA's Practice Portal page on Acquired Apraxia of Speech)\n\nSpeech intelligibility—the degree to which the listener understands the individual's speech\n\nSpeech comprehensibility—the degree to which the listener understands the spoken message, given other contextual information (e.g., topic, context, gestures)\n\nLanguage\n\nReceptive and expressive language skills in oral and written modalities to help distinguish between dysarthria and/or apraxia and aphasia (see ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Dysarthria in Adults, Acquired Apraxia of Speech, and Aphasia)\n\nPragmatic language skills in various communication contexts (see ASHA's Practice Portal page on Social Communication Disorder)\n\nCognitive-Communication\n\nAspects of verbal or nonverbal communication that may be affected by disruptions in cognition (e.g., attention, memory, organization, executive function; see ASHA's resources on cognitive-communication)\n\nSwallowing\n\nSwallowing function with various foods and food textures (see ASHA's Practice Portal page on Adult Dysphagia)\n\nOther Assessment Components\n\nIdentification of contextual barriers and facilitators and the potential for effective compensatory techniques and strategies, including the use of cognitive aids and AAC. See ASHA's Practice Portal Page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication.\n\nIdentification of relevant follow-up services for appropriate intervention and support.\n\nComprehensive Audiologic and Vestibular Assessment: Typical Components\n\nCase History\n\nReview case history information, including medical information and emotional and mental status\n\nReview previous assessments (e.g., speech-language, physical therapy, occupational therapy, audiologic)\n\nGather additional details related to hearing, balance, and auditory processing difficulties\n\nBehavioral Hearing Testing\n\nPure-tone and speech audiometry, including modifications (as needed) such as\n\nOtoacoustic emissions or auditory brainstem response testing—if accurate test results cannot be obtained using traditional behavioral testing methods\n\nSee the Assessment section of ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Hearing Loss in Children and Hearing Loss in Adults.\n\nAuditory Processing\n\nSpeech in noise\n\nTemporal processing\n\nBinaural processing\n\nVestibular Testing\n\nDix-Hallpike and roll tests\n\nSemicircular canal function tests, such as caloric, rotational, and video head impulse testing\n\nOtolith testing, such as (a) ocular and cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and (b) the subjective visual vertical (SVV) test\n\nVideonystamography (VNG)\n\n(Fausti, Wilmington, Gallun, Myers, & Henry, 2009; Wintrow, 2013)\n\nSee the Assessment section of ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Balance System Disorders and Tinnitus and Hyperacusis.\n\nGeneral Assessment Considerations\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration is necessary to maximize the breadth and depth of skills tested and to ensure that the individual is not over-tested or subject to practice effects due to repeated exposure to the same or similar assessment tools.\n\nDepression or anxiety—as a consequence of neurological damage or as a part of the post-traumatic stress disorder complex—can adversely affect test performance. If signs and symptoms of depression are present or suspected, the individual is referred to a neuropsychologist, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist for follow-up.\n\nThe side effects of prescription drugs may affect test performance (e.g., due to excessive drowsiness). Polypharmacy—the concurrent use of several medications—is common among individuals with multiple medical conditions, and some medications may worsen cognitive problems worse.\n\nRepetitive brain trauma contributes—along with other variables—to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which in turn influences overall cognitive and behavioral function and increases the risk for dementia (Stern et al., 2011). Therefore, consider the effects of repeated brain injury when determining prior level of function and baseline skill levels.\n\nPeriodic, ongoing assessment is important because neurological recovery can occur for several months or longer after some types of severe brain injury. Ongoing assessment can also be used to examine an individuals' responses to rehabilitation and to life after the injury.\n\nConsiderations for Cognitive-Communication Assessment\n\nThe following factors may influence the assessment of cognitive-communication abilities in individuals with TBI:\n\nLevel of consciousness and arousal\n\nNeurobehavioral deficits, such as agitation and combativeness\n\nMotor deficits (e.g., postural limitations. hemiparesis, limb apraxia) that affect physical endurance and participation\n\nSensory deficits (e.g., visual neglect, hearing loss)\n\nConsiderations for Swallowing Assessment\n\nFactors that can affect swallowing function following TBI include\n\nextent of brain injury;\n\nduration of ventilation and endotracheal intubation and/or presence of a tracheostomy;\n\nimpairments in positioning and motor control that affect self-feeding;\n\nphysical damage to the oral, pharyngeal, and/or laryngeal structures;\n\npresence of oral and/or pharyngeal sensory disorders;\n\npresence of oral and/or pharyngeal movement disorders; and\n\ncognitive impairment and behavioral dysregulation (e.g., poor memory, limited insight, impaired sequencing skills, poor judgment and reasoning, and impaired communication).\n\nSee Murdoch and Theodoros (2001) for a summary of related research.\n\nConsider the patient's level of arousal, cognitive status, and ability to follow commands throughout ongoing swallowing assessment. Depending on the individual's overall alertness and ability to participate, the clinical bedside examination may also include feeding trials of a variety of food textures and liquid consistencies.\n\nConsiderations for Audiological and Vestibular Assessment\n\nComorbidities—including memory and attention deficits, tinnitus, dizziness, and anxiety—can make it difficult to attribute auditory complaints to auditory-only processing deficits and may confound audiologic test results.\n\nBalance is a multisensory function. Therefore, during vestibular assessment, “clinicians working with individuals with blast trauma need to consider several causes of postural instability, including TBI, orthostatic hypotension, cervical vertigo, visual deficits, possible side effects of ototoxic drugs, and vestibular pathology” (Fausti et al., 2009, p. 804).\n\nConsiderations for Cultural and Linguistic Variations\n\nWhen selecting assessment tests, the SLP considers the influence of cultural and linguistic factors on the individual's communication style and the potential impact of impairment on function.\n\nClinicians make appropriate accommodations and modifications to the testing process to reconcile cultural and linguistic variations. Comprehensive documentation includes descriptions of these accommodations and modifications. Scores from standardized tests are often invalidated in these cases and may not be appropriate to report. Rather than reporting scores, results can be stated descriptively (e.g., number and types of errors made on various assessment tasks.) See ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology; Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators; and Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nDue to the complexity of cognitive sequelae in TBI and its influence on bilingual language production (Penn, Frankel, Watermeyer, & Russell, 2010), a thorough case history and interviews with the family and individual are particularly useful in identifying premorbid language proficiency, language preference for assessment and treatment of linguistic deficits, and communicative needs in the community (Lorenzen & Murray, 2008).\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Traumatic Brain Injury (Adults) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspectives.\n\nTreatment of persons with TBI considers\n\npersonal and contextual factors, such as the individual's age, education, premorbid status, social history, present social context, and vocational status (current or premorbid);\n\nthe complex relationship between cognitive domains (e.g., the effect of attention and short-term memory deficits on new learning);\n\nthe impact of fatigue and limited physical endurance on participation in treatment; and\n\nthe impact of poor insight and executive function deficits on the ability to (a) recognize breakdowns in function, (b) buy into the potential benefits of treatment, and (c) adhere to specific recommendations (e.g., swallow safety guidelines).\n\nThe goal of intervention in TBI is to achieve the highest level of independent function for participation in daily living. Consistent with the ICF framework (WHO, 2001), intervention is designed to\n\ncapitalize on strengths and address weaknesses related to underlying structures and functions that affect communication;\n\nfacilitate the individual's activities and participation by assisting the person in acquiring new skills and strategies; and\n\nmodify contextual factors that serve as barriers and enhance facilitators of successful communication and participation, including development and use of appropriate accommodations.\n\nInterventions that enhance a patient's activity and participation through modification of contextual factors may be warranted, even if the prognosis for improved body structure/function is limited.\n\nSee ASHA's Person-Centered Focus on Function: Traumatic Brain Injury [PDF] for an example of goal setting consistent with ICF.\n\nPerson- and Family-Centered Care\n\nPerson- and family-centered care is a collaborative approach grounded in a mutually beneficial partnership among individuals, families, and clinicians. Each party is equally important in the relationship, and each party respects the knowledge, skills, and experiences that the others bring to the process. This approach to care incorporates individual and family preferences and priorities and offers a range of services, including providing counseling and emotional support, providing information and resources, coordinating services, and teaching specific skills to facilitate communication.\n\nPerson- and family-centered care for individuals with TBI\n\nprovides information to the individual, their family/caregivers, and other significant persons about the nature of deficits, the course of treatment, and the prognosis for recovery;\n\nincludes the individual in collaborative decision making about self-determined goals; and\n\nconsiders input from the family/caregivers and other professionals involved in the individual's care.\n\nSee ASHA's resource on person- and family-centered care.\n\nTreatment Approaches\n\nTreatment for TBI can be restorative and/or compensatory. These approaches are not mutually exclusive; aspects of more than one approach often are integrated into the delivery of services.\n\nRestorative approaches involve direct therapy aimed at improving or restoring impaired function(s) through retraining. Treatment is often hierarchical, targeting specific processes in the impaired domain before introducing more demanding higher-level tasks, and eventually generalizing skills to more functional activities and tasks (Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001).\n\nCompensatory approaches focus on adapting to deficits by learning new or different ways of doing things to minimize difficulties (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 1998). Compensatory approaches draw on the individual's strengths to maximize their abilities, often through the use of external or internal aids.\n\nA compensatory approach to treatment may also include accommodations and/or modifications. Accommodations are changes to the environment, task, or mode of response that allow an individual to access and participate in an activity without changing the activity itself. Modifications are changes to the nature of an activity to facilitate participation and promote success in home, community, academic, and work settings.\n\nTreatment Options\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of both general and specific treatments for persons with cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders associated with TBI. This list is not exhaustive, and inclusion of any specific treatment approach does not imply endorsement by ASHA.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication (AAC) involves supplementing or replacing natural speech and/or writing with aided (e.g., pictures, line drawings, speech-generating devices, and tangible objects) and/or unaided (e.g., manual signs, gestures, and finger spelling) symbols. AAC may be temporary (e.g., used by patients postoperatively in intensive care) or permanent (e.g., used by an individual with a disability who will need to use some form of AAC throughout their lifetime).\n\nFactors that influence selection and use of appropriate AAC systems following TBI include the individual's communication abilities and needs, as well as their cognitive, neurobehavioral, motor, sensory, and perceptual impairments. Individuals with TBI may rely on assistive technologies to compensate for their cognitive impairments in the absence of linguistic or motor speech disorders (Fried-Oken, Beukelman, & Hux, 2011).\n\nSee ASHA's Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication.\n\nCognitive-Communication Treatment\n\nCognitive-communication treatment may focus on restoring skills and/or compensating for deficits. Treatment can address discrete cognitive-communication domains (e.g., attention) or can focus more globally on functional communication.\n\nCognitive-communication treatments include the following:\n\nSensory stimulation—also known as coma stimulation—is the systematic exposure of an individual in a comatose or minimally conscious state to a variety of visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and kinesthetic stimuli to improve arousal and level of consciousness and to prevent sensory deprivation (Giacino, Katz, & Schiff, 2006; Thomas, 2018). Sensory stimulation allows for frequent monitoring of an individual's responsiveness during recovery.\n\nDual task training focuses on improving task complexity by targeting the ability to carry out two competing tasks simultaneously. Dual task training is used to restore executive functions often affected by TBI. The tasks can involve any combination of cognitive and/or motor tasks (Evans, Greenfield, Wilson, & Bateman, 2009).\n\nComputer-assisted treatment (CAT) refers to the use of specially designed commercial software to improve cognitive-communication functions through repeated, structured practice of tasks related to attention, memory, problem solving, executive function, language, and speech. Software programs adapt tasks; exercises increase in difficulty as performance improves (Lebowitz, Dams-O'Connor, & Cantor, 2012). Software programs are available for use on computers, smartphones, and tablets. Computer-assisted treatment can be used and monitored by a clinician in person or remotely, thus providing consistent feedback to the individual (e.g., Politis & Norman, 2016; Teasell et al., 2013). See ASHA's resource on what to ask when evaluating any procedure, product, or program.\n\nInstructional or teaching techniques used in cognitive-communication treatment include the following:\n\nDirect instruction is a comprehensive instructional technique that involves identifying target and prerequisite skills; conducting a task analysis to break skills down into smaller steps; providing models; giving consistent and immediate feedback; and providing both massed practice (longer, intensive practice sessions) and spaced/distributed practice (practice broken up into a number of smaller practice sessions).\n\nStrategy-based instruction focuses on the use of various strategies to improve awareness, self-monitoring, and self-regulation.\n\nMetacognitive skills training uses goal-setting strategies to facilitate learning and behavioral success. This training uses strategies such as self-talk, self-reflection, mental imagery, and agendas that provide feedback and track progress toward goals. See for example, Cicerone (2006) and Ownsworth, Quinn, Fleming, Kendall, and Shum (2010).\n\nCompensatory strategy training capitalizes on intact skills to overcome deficits resulting from TBI (Wilson, 2002). Compensatory strategies use internal aids and external aids (Shum, Fleming, Gill, Gullo, & Strong, 2011).\n\nInternal aids are strategies used to enhance memory and executive function (de Joode, van Heugten, Verhey, & van Boxtel, 2010; Gillespie, Best, & O'Neill, 2012; Sohlberg et al., 2007; Wild, 2013). They include mnemonics; visual imagery (Kashel et al., 2002; OʼNeil-Pirozzi, Kennedy, & Sohlberg, 2015); elaborative encoding and association (Oberg & Turkstra, 1998); and chunking (Kennedy, 2006).\n\nExternal aids are used to improve attention, time management, organization, and recall of events and information (Burns, 2004; Teasell et al., 2013). Computers and handheld devices, including smartphones and voice recorders, can be used as functional external aids. Low-tech options include calendars, timers, checklists, maps, color-coded binders, and small notebooks (Burns, 2004; DePompei et al., 2008).\n\nErrorless learning is an instructional technique that tries to minimize errors as the individual learns a new skill (Ownsworth et al., 2013). Errorless learning involves task analysis to break skills down into smaller steps, modeling before the first attempt at performing the task, giving immediate corrective feedback, and carefully fading supports and prompts (Sohlberg, Ehlhardt, & Kennedy, 2005; Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011). Spaced/distributed practice may facilitate errorless learning (Melton & Bourgeois, 2005). Errorless learning is most helpful for individuals with relatively unimpaired procedural memory (memory of how to perform certain procedures) and severely impaired declarative memory (memory of facts and events).\n\nSocial Communication Interventions\n\nSocial communication interventions are designed (a) to improve functional conversational skills, including the use of appropriate pragmatic language norms (e.g., taking turns and remaining on topic) and (b) to help the individual with TBI navigate social situations.\n\nComponents of social communication intervention in adults with TBI include\n\nsharing knowledge with, and training, everyday communication partners;\n\nsituational training to improve social perception and the ability to interpret others' behavior;\n\nsituational coaching prior to challenging situations; and\n\ncounseling to help an individual identify a sense of self that includes positive social interaction strategies (Ylvisaker, Turkstra, & Coelho, 2005). See also ASHA's Practice Portal page on Counseling for Professional Service Delivery.\n\nCommunication partner training (CPT) is an example of social communication intervention. The goal of CPT is to improve the communication effectiveness of individuals with TBI by training communication partners to use strategies such as\n\nproviding emotional support;\n\nusing a positive question style;\n\nusing collaborative turn-taking; and\n\nhelping the individual with TBI extend and organize their thinking (e.g., Sim, Power, & Togher, 2013; Togher, McDonald, Tate, Power, & Rietdijk, 2013).\n\nSee also ASHA's Practice Portal page on Social Communication Disorder.\n\nSpeech and Voice\n\nTBI can result in dysarthria and apraxia, as well as problems with respiration, phonation, and resonance. Intervention may focus on the individual speech subsystems of respiration, phonation, articulation, and velopharyngeal function or, more globally, on overall verbal communication function using behavioral and instrumental treatments, compensatory strategies, and/or environmental modifications.\n\nSee ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Dysarthria in Adults, Acquired Apraxia of Speech, Voice Disorders, and Resonance Disorders.\n\nDysphagia\n\nThe goal of dysphagia treatment is to support safe and efficient oral intake and to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration.\n\nConsiderations for dysphagia management in individuals with TBI include\n\ncognitive-linguistic deficits (e.g., auditory processing and memory loss) that can affect learning, recall, and use of compensatory swallowing;\n\nneurobehavioral deficits (e.g., impulsivity, agitation);\n\nperceptual deficits (e.g., visual field neglect);\n\nphysical limitations that can affect motor control and posture; and\n\nsensory impairments that can affect oral intake and swallow safety.\n\nEffective dysphagia management relies on the consistent implementation of compensatory strategies. Deficits in any of the areas noted above can have a negative impact on the success of treatment.\n\nSee ASHA's Practice Portal page on Adult Dysphagia.\n\nHearing and Balance\n\nAudiologists are integral to rehabilitation of hearing and balance deficits associated with TBI. Treatment for hearing loss includes selection and fitting of amplification devices and training in the use of assistive technologies (e.g., hearing assistive technology [HATS]).\n\nThe treatment goals for balance disorders associated with TBI are (a) to promote the central nervous system's natural compensation processes to reduce or eliminate symptoms, (b) to decrease the individual's sensitivity to symptom-provoking movements, and (c) to reduce the risk of falls.\n\nAudiologists are also involved in the management of tinnitus associated with TBI. Management can include the use of hearing aids, sound masking, counseling, and cognitive-behavioral interventions.\n\nTreatment for audiology-related symptoms may include counseling about the use of coping and compensatory skills that can minimize the effects of hearing and balance disorders and reduce safety risks.\n\nSee ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Hearing Loss in Adults, Hearing Aids for Adults, Balance System Disorders, and Tinnitus and Hyperacusis. See also ASHA's resources titled Hearing Assistive Technology (HATS) and Audiology Information Series: Hearing Assistive Technology.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Considerations\n\nTreatment considers the cultural values and norms of the individual. Different dimensions of culture may influence an individual's views on seeking care and external support following a TBI (see ASHA's resource on examples of cultural dimensions). For example, some cultures may have a sense of shame or feel the need to hide a disability. This may influence how an individual and their family/caregivers approach treatment. See ASHA's Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nTreatment is also sensitive to linguistic diversity. It is provided in the language(s) used by the individual with TBI. See ASHA's Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology and Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators.\n\nTransitioning After TBI\n\nIndividuals with persistent cognitive-communication deficits after a TBI may continue to face challenges as they return to work or academic settings and manage daily activities such as shopping and handling finances (e.g., Colantonio et al., 2004; Kennedy, Krause, & Turkstra, 2008; Meulenbroek, Bowers, & Turkstra, 2016; Meulenbroek & Turkstra, 2016).\n\nThe potential impact of persisting deficits highlights the need for continued support. The role of the SLP is to identify communication-related deficits, determine how they might affect the individual in various settings, and design treatment approaches to minimize the impact of these deficits.\n\nConsiderations in Work Settings\n\nThe nature of deficits associated with TBI creates unique challenges in work settings. Fatigue, sensory issues, health concerns, and cognitive-communication deficits (e.g., language processing, reading and writing, verbal reasoning, memory, and pragmatics) can have a negative impact on performance (see, e.g., Meulenbroek et al., 2016; Meulenbroek & Turkstra, 2016).\n\nThe SLP identifies current cognitive-communication deficits, determines how these may affect life skills and job performance, and then trains the individual on strategies they can use to minimize the impact of the deficits in work settings (Bonelli, Ritter, & Kinsler, 2007). The SLP collaborates with counselors and psychologists, vocational rehabilitation specialists, job coaches, and employers, as appropriate, to help implement necessary accommodations for maximum outcomes.\n\nIndividuals with TBI may be eligible for protections in the workplace under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This law protects a qualified individual from discrimination based on their disability. Section 504 prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who meet job requirements and can perform essential job duties with or without reasonable accommodations. It may also provide vocational training and employment services for eligible individuals. SLPs can give input about reasonable accommodations to minimize the effects of cognitive-communication deficits. These include providing written task instructions and using time management devices to help the individual stay on task.\n\nConsiderations in Academic Settings\n\nAttention, memory, learning, executive function, and social–emotional impairments—coupled with self-regulation challenges—place individuals with TBI at greater risk for failure in academic settings (Kennedy et al., 2008).\n\nThe SLP can provide support to individuals in college (and vocational training programs) by identifying systems and services to facilitate studying, learning, and time management, and by training individuals to use compensatory strategies and promoting self-advocacy (Kennedy & Krause, 2011; Turkstra, Gamazon-Waddell, & Evans, 2004; Volkers, 2015).\n\nDisability support services staff may collaborate with SLPs to select courses, modify schedules, and implement accommodations (under Section 504 or similar plans, if applicable). Accommodations might include notetakers, extended time for tests and assignments, and assistive technology (e.g., text-to-speech and speech-to-text devices that help with reading and writing tasks).\n\nService Delivery\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Traumatic Brain Injury (Adults) Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nIn addition to determining the optimal treatment approaches for individuals with TBI, SLPs consider other service delivery variables—including format, provider, dosage, and timing—that may affect treatment outcomes.\n\nFormat\n\nFormat is the structure of the treatment session (e.g., group vs. individual). Group therapy can provide individuals with TBI an opportunity to initiate social interaction in a structured environment with feedback from the clinician and peers. The combination of individual and group therapy is more effective in reaching functional goals than the group format alone (Tate et al., 2014).\n\nTechnology has been incorporated into the delivery of services for TBI, including the use of telepractice to deliver face-to-face services remotely. Videoconferencing and interactive skills-based programs via telepractice may be more meaningful for providing support and information to caregivers than self-guided web sessions (Rietdijk, Togher, & Power, 2012). Telepractice may allow clinicians to help patients practice skills in the context in which those skills will be used (Turkstra, Quinn-Padron, Johnson, Workinger, & Antoniotti, 2012). See ASHA's Practice Portal Page on Telepractice.\n\nProvider\n\nProvider refers to the person providing the treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, caregiver). Cognitive rehabilitation is most successful in the context of the individual's needs and current living environment. Family members and significant others play a critical role in supporting the individual with TBI and augmenting the treatment plan. Training that incorporates everyday communication partners may allow partners to facilitate carryover beyond the training sessions (Togher et al., 2014).\n\nDosage\n\nDosage refers to the frequency, intensity, and duration of service. Clinicians consider the individual's arousal level and ability to tolerate therapy sessions, prognosis, stage in recovery, and frequency of other therapeutic activity when determining the appropriate frequency, intensity, and duration of services.\n\nTiming\n\nTiming refers to the timing of intervention relative to the injury. Treatment typically begins with assessment in the acute or rehabilitation inpatient setting and may continue in post-acute care (e.g., post-acute rehabilitation).\n\nSetting\n\nSetting refers to the location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based). Clinicians consider the individual's functional abilities and goals and how best to facilitate carryover when determining the most appropriate setting for intervention. Time-limited residential programs and community-based programs are available in some areas to foster community integration and provide peer support.\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association. (2013).
