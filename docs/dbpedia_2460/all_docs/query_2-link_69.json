        "text": "Whether a student is looking to jump into the workforce, start their career with a two-year degree, or prepare for transfer to a four-year school, BCCC has a program for them. Assist your students in exploring a “pathway” that works for them!\n\nPathways\n\nAn important first step is to select a program of study; degree or credit certificate. Most programs are linked to one of five Pathways which provide assistance in course selection, so it’s much clearer for students to determine what to do next, and what they should take each semester. Their Pathway will also offer them a variety of program-related, wraparound support services to enhance their classroom experience and bolster success.\n\nGet on the Right Pathway!\n\nBased on main areas of interest, incoming BCCC degree and certificate seeking credit students are grouped into one of eight Pathways:\n\nHealth & Biosciences\n\nInformation Technology & Cybersecurity\n\nHuman Services & Law Enforcement\n\nBusiness Management, Finance & Professional Services\n\nTransportation, Distribution & Logistics\n\nManufacturing, Construction & Engineering Technologies\n\nHospitality & Tourism\n\nVisual & Performing Arts/General Studies\n\nThe Student Success Center assists students with course selection and provides programming geared towards successful entry into college, degree/certificate completion, transfer, and career success. Students may meet with their designated pathway advisor or any advisor when making their course selections."
