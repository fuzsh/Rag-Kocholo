        "text": "Introduction to Trauma and Traumatic Stress Reactions\n\nProviding a comprehensive literature review on trauma, traumatic stress, trauma-informed care (TIC), and trauma-related interventions is a daunting task when considering the quantity and prolific production of research in this area in the past 20 years. To manage the volume of information, this literature review mainly focuses on reviews and meta-analyses rather than seminal work to address many of the most relevant topics.\n\nWhat Is Trauma?\n\nIn this text, “trauma” refers to experiences that cause intense physical and psychological stress reactions. “Trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s functioning and physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being” (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative, 2012, p. 2). Although many individuals report a single specific traumatic event, others, especially those seeking mental health or substance abuse services, have been exposed to multiple or chronic traumatic events. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), trauma is defined as when an individual person is exposed “to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence” (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013, p. 271).\n\nThe definition of psychological trauma is not limited to diagnostic criteria, however. In fact, some clinicians have moved away from considering trauma-related symptoms as indicators of a mental disorder and instead view them as part of the normal human survival instinct or as “adaptive mental processes involved in the assimilation and integration of new information with intense survival emphasis which exposure to the trauma has provided” (Turnbull, 1998, p. 88). These normal adaptive processes only become pathological if they are inhibited in some way (Turnbull, 1998), or if they are left unacknowledged and therefore untreated (Scott, 1990).\n\nTrauma has been characterized more broadly by others. For example, Horowitz (1989) defined it as a sudden and forceful event that overwhelms a person’s ability to respond to it, recognizing that a trauma need not involve actual physical harm to oneself; an event can be traumatic if it contradicts one’s worldview and overpowers one’s ability to cope.\n\nHow Common Is Trauma?\n\nTrauma exposure is common in the United States. However, trauma exposure varies considerably according to different demographic characteristics and is especially high among clients receiving behavioral health services (see the discussions under the headings “Extent and Effects of Trauma and Traumatic Stress Reactions in Specific Populations” and “Other Disorders That May Be Related to Trauma” for more information on relevant rates). Although the large surveys discussed here provide data on trauma exposure for the general population, published literature often provides more specific data as well, which is one reason why differences in exposure according to gender and race/ethnicity are highlighted here.\n\nAt one time, trauma was considered an abnormal experience. Contrary to this myth, the first National Comorbidity Study (NCS), a large national survey designed to study the prevalence and effects of mental disorders in the United States, established how prevalent traumas are in the lives of the general U.S. population (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995). Presented with a list of 11 types of traumatic experiences and a 12th “other” category, 60.7 percent of men and 51.2 percent of women reported experiencing at least one trauma in their lifetime (Kessler, 2000; Kessler et al. 1995; 1999):\n\nThe most common trauma was witnessing someone being badly injured or killed (cited by 35.6 percent of men and 14.5 percent of women).\n\nThe second most common trauma was being involved in a fire, flood, or other natural disaster (cited by 18.9 percent of men and 15.2 percent of women).\n\nThe third most common trauma was a life-threatening accident/assault, such as from an automobile accident, a gunshot, or a fall (cited by 25 percent of men and 13.8 percent of women.\n\nThe NCS also found that it was not uncommon for individuals to have experienced multiple traumatic events (Kessler, 2000). Among men in the total sample, 14.5 percent reported two traumatic events, 9.5 percent reported three, 10.2 percent reported four or more, and 26.5 percent reported only one such event. Among women, 13.5 percent of the total sample reported two traumatic events, 5 percent reported three, 6.4 percent reported four or more, and 26.3 percent reported only one.\n\nThe National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) is another large national survey of behavioral health, but it only assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma exposure in its second wave of interviews, in which 34,653 of the original 43,093 respondents were reinterviewed (Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, & Grant, 2011a). In the Wave 2 interview, respondents were asked about 27 different types of potentially traumatic events; the most commonly reported traumatic events were serious illness or injury to someone close (affecting 48.4 percent of those who did not have PTSD symptoms and 66.6 percent of those with PTSD), unexpected death of someone close (affecting 42.2 percent of those without PTSD and 65.9 percent of those with PTSD), and seeing someone badly injured or killed (affecting 24 percent of those without PTSD and 43.1 percent of those with PTSD; Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, & Grant, 2011a). According to the same data, 71.6 percent of the sample witnessed trauma, 30.7 percent experienced a trauma that resulted in injury, and 17.3 percent experienced a trauma that was purely psychological in nature (e.g., being threatened with a weapon; El-Gabalawy, 2011).\n\nNESARC also found that exposure to specific traumatic events varied considerably according to race, ethnicity, or cultural group. The survey found that 83.7 percent of non-Latino White Americans reported a traumatic event, compared with 76.4 percent of African Americans, 68.2 percent of Latinos, and 66.4 of percent of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders (Roberts, Gilman, Breslau, Breslau, & Koenen, 2011). Exposure to specific traumas also varied considerably. White Americans were more likely to report an unexpected death of someone they knew (44.7 percent did) than were African Americans (39.9 percent), Latinos (29.6 percent), and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders (25.8 percent) as well as being more likely to report having a close friend/relative who experienced a life-threatening injury. On the other hand, African Americans were the most likely to report being the victim of assaultive violence (29.7 percent), followed by White Americans (26.1 percent), Latinos (25.6 percent), and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders (16.3 percent). In terms of combat trauma, White Americans and African Americans were about as likely to have been combatants (10 percent of each group reported combat trauma), and more likely than Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders (5.4 percent) or Latinos (4.4 percent). However, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders were the most likely to have been unarmed civilians in a war zone (7.5 percent), followed by Latinos (3.8 percent), White Americans (2 percent), and African Americans (1.9 percent).\n\nAcross the world, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) surveys, which includes the NCS and NCS replication (NCS-R) and surveys from 20 other countries, the most commonly reported traumas are the death of a loved one (30.5 percent), witnessing violence to others (21.8 percent), and experiencing interpersonal violence (18.8 percent; Stein et al., 2010). As Kessler (2000) noted, trauma from assaultive violence in the United States is likely to be more common than in most other developed countries in general. However, trauma related to other traumatic events (e.g., automobile accidents, natural disasters) appear to be quite similar throughout developed countries.\n\nA longitudinal survey from New Zealand also provides useful data on trauma exposure. In this survey, a cohort of subjects from a single town was interviewed at age 26 and again at age 32 in order to evaluate what constituted the worst trauma those individuals had experienced (Koenen, Moffitt et al., 2008). The types of worst experiences reported before age 26 were:\n\nSudden unexpected death by trauma of a close family member or friend (38 percent).\n\nPersonal assault or victimization (32 percent).\n\nSerious accidents (14 percent).\n\nHearing about or witnessing a close friend or relative experiencing an assault, serious accident, or serious injury (12 percent).\n\nPersonal illness (3 percent).\n\nNatural disaster (1 percent)\n\nHow Common Are Traumatic Stress Reactions?\n\nAs with trauma rates, PTSD rates vary considerably across different demographic groups. The reader should consult the section titled “Extent and Effects of Trauma and Traumatic Stress Reactions in Specific Populations” for more specific information on PTSD rates. More general information from major surveys is included in this section.\n\nThe DSM-5 (APA, 2013) estimates that the prevalence rate of PTSD in the U.S. adult population is about 8 percent, but studies of populations at high risk for PTSD (e.g., combat veterans, survivors of natural disasters) have found PTSD rates ranging from 3 to 58 percent. The NCS (which evaluated behavioral health disorders, including PTSD) found that, for Americans ages 15 to 54, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD (based on DSM Third Edition, text revision [DSM-III-R; APA, 1987] criteria) was 7.8 percent, with women more than twice as likely as men to have the disorder during their lives (10.4 percent of women and 5 percent of men; Kessler et al., 1995). In the NCS-R, which interviewed 9,282 individuals ages 18 and older between February 2001 and April 2003, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 6.8 percent, again with a much higher rate for women (9.7 percent) than for men (3.6 percent; Kessler, Berglund et al., 2005; NCS, 2005). The past-year prevalence rate for PTSD was 3.5 percent, with 5.2 percent of women and 1.8 percent of men having PTSD in the 12 months prior to their interviews (Kessler, Chiu et al., 2005).\n\nKessler, Berglund et al. (2005) examined the issue of lifetime prevalence in the NCS-R to determine whether the prevalence statistics of the NCS were still valid in light of changes to the diagnostic criteria that occurred with the publication of the DSM Fourth Edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000). The study was divided into two parts. Part I included face-to-face diagnostic interviews of 9,282 participants who were 18 years of age or older. Part II included factors related to diagnosis (e.g., risk factors) and was completed only with participants from Part I who had a “lifetime disorder” and a probability sample from other Part I participants (n=5,692). Data analysis in this study estimated a lifetime PTSD prevalence of 6.8 percent, but the authors also analyzed the data to determine projected lifetime risk and found that at age 75, the lifetime risk for PTSD was 28 percent higher than the lifetime prevalence estimate. However, the authors suggested that because of certain study limitations (e.g., related to sample parameters, reluctance to participate or to disclose diagnoses), these results should be considered a conservative estimate.\n\nAs noted earlier, Wave 1 of NESARC did not evaluate PTSD, but Wave 2 found that 6.4 percent of the population (8.6 percent of women and 4.1 percent of men) had PTSD at some point during their lives (Pietrzak et al., 2011a). NESARC researchers also evaluated lifetime prevalence of partial PTSD (defined as including at least one symptom under Criteria B, C, and D, with symptom duration of at least 1 month) and found that 6.6 percent of the total population (8.6 percent of women and 4.5 percent of men) met criteria for partial but not full PTSD at some point during their lives. It should be noted, however, that most large behavioral health surveys, such as the NCS and NESARC, rely on retrospective evaluation of symptoms, and some research indicates that they underestimate behavioral health disorders compared with prospective longitudinal studies (Moffitt et al., 2009). Differences in prevalence estimates may also be related both to changes in PTSD diagnostic criteria and to a variety of methodological differences in the research (e.g., different diagnostic instruments, procedures) on which these estimates were based (Kessler, 2000; Kessler, Chiu et al., 2005; Kessler et al., 1995; Narrow, Rae, Robins, & Regier, 2002).\n\nIt is also worth noting that delayed PTSD may account for a considerable percentage of PTSD cases. A meta-analytic review that included studies in which individuals were assessed 1 to 6 months after trauma exposure and again at least 6 months later found that 24.8 percent of PTSD cases involved delayed trauma (Smid, Mooren, van der Mast, Gersons, & Kleber, 2009). Studies included in the review found between 3.8 and 83.3 percent of their samples had delayed PTSD. Factors that were associated with significantly greater odds of having delayed rather than nondelayed PTSD included a Western (as opposed to non-Western) cultural background and military combat exposure.\n\nMore recently, Smid, van der Velden, Gersons, and Kleber (2012) conducted a study of 1,083 individuals affected by a large fireworks disaster to evaluate delayed PTSD rates at both 18 months and 4 years after the disaster. In their review of prospective studies of disaster survivors, they found that between 2 and 19 percent of survivors developed delayed PTSD, whereas in their own study, 3.8 percent (n=24) of the total sample (n=636) who were available for all assessments had delayed PTSD and 13.5 percent had PTSD that was not delayed.\n\nWhat Is Complex Trauma?\n\nAn individual has been exposed to complex trauma when he or she has either experienced repeated instances of the same type of trauma over a period of time or experienced multiple types of trauma (van der Kolk, McFarlane, & Weisaeth, 1996). Expert consensus is that people who have complex trauma will typically require more intensive and extensive treatment as well as possible adaptations to standard treatment (see the expert clinician survey in Cloitre et al., 2011).\n\nThis Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) uses a definition of complex trauma developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN; 2003), which defines complex trauma as a “dual problem” involving both “exposure to traumatic events and the impact of this exposure on immediate and long-term outcomes” (p. 5). NCTSN notes that complex trauma usually involves multiple instances of trauma (occurring either simultaneously or sequentially) and multiple forms of trauma (e.g., experiencing emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and physical abuse). Also, complex trauma, such as that experienced by children who sustain repeated abuse, typically results in emotional dysregulation and a lack of appropriate coping mechanisms, which in turn can increase the risk of further traumatic experiences. Although the NCTSN definition was developed for explaining childhood trauma, it can be adapted to fit an adult population.\n\nHerman (1992) was among the first to highlight the inadequacy of existing diagnostic criteria for PTSD for people who have complex trauma by pointing out that these criteria were developed based on a clinical consideration of symptoms experienced by individuals who had survived relatively time-limited traumatic experiences (e.g., combat veterans, survivors of rape). Herman proposed that many individuals with a history of prolonged and repeated trauma (as opposed to trauma that is time-limited or related to a single traumatic event) present with clinical characteristics that “transcend simple PTSD” (p. 379); these characteristics include physical symptoms (including many of the symptoms listed in the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, although they may appear more “complex, diffuse, and tenacious” [p. 379]), personality changes in which the individual’s sense of identity is negatively affected and which may inhibit the individual’s ability to form relationships with others, and a propensity for vulnerability to further harm (by self or others).\n\nIn 1992, Herman published the seminal work Trauma and Recovery (revised in 1997), which discussed proposed changes to the next DSM that would include a new term for this trauma-related constellation of symptoms. Her suggestion was the term “complex post-traumatic stress disorder” (complex PTSD). However, none of the proposed changes she discussed were included in the DSM-IV (APA, 1994), DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000), or DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Jackson, Nissenson, and Cloitre (2010) observed that the DSM-IV classification of “associated features and disorders” (APA, 2000) for PTSD is intended to cover symptoms of complex PTSD (e.g., problems with affect regulation, impaired relationships), but it does not take into account one key aspect of complex PTSD as it was originally defined, which is that such symptoms and disorders (e.g., substance abuse) are not viewed as secondary to PTSD symptoms, but rather, as equally important and directly related to traumatic experiences.\n\nComplex trauma is typically interpersonal and generally involves situations in which the person who is traumatized cannot escape from the traumatic experiences because he or she is constrained physically, socially, or psychologically (Herman, 1992). Because of this, people who have experienced complex trauma often have additional disturbances in their ability to self-regulate—beyond those seen in PTSD—that are not related to complex trauma. These include difficulties in emotional regulation, difficulties in one’s capacity for relationships, problems with attention or consciousness (e.g., dissociative experiences), a disturbed belief system, and/or somatic complaints or disorganization (Briere & Scott, 2012; Cloitre et al., 2011; van der Kolk, McFarlane, & Van der Hart, 1996).\n\nWhat Is Acute Stress Disorder?\n\nAcute stress disorder (ASD), according to the DSM-5, involves a traumatic stress reaction that occurs within 1 month of trauma exposure and includes at least nine symptoms from any of the five categories (intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal; APA, 2013). To receive this diagnosis, the individual also has to display a reaction that causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. ASD can occur at the time of the trauma exposure or any time within 4 weeks of that event As Roberts, Kitchiner, Kendardy, and Bisson (2010) observed, there is a large degree of overlap between ASD and PTSD symptoms, but what distinguishes them is the timing of those symptoms relative to trauma exposure. Cardeña and Carlson (2011) provided a history of the ASD diagnosis and discussed the validity of the diagnostic criteria. ASD can develop into PTSD if the symptoms extend beyond 1 month.\n\nWhat Is PTSD?\n\nPTSD is a traumatic stress reaction that develops in response to a significant trauma. It is a mental disorder, and for behavioral health providers in the United States, the currently accepted diagnostic criteria for the disorder are those provided by the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). For professionals in the field of behavioral health, the definition of psychological trauma is historically and clinically tied to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, which made their first appearance in the DSM-III (APA, 1980). However, over the years, the diagnostic criteria have undergone some significant changes. These changes are important factors to consider when reading, evaluating, and especially comparing research.\n\nCriterion A concerns the type of trauma involved; Criterion B describes symptoms of intrusion; Criterion C includes the presence of persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma; Criterion D highlights symptoms of negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s); Criterion E includes marked alterations in arousal and reactivity as it relates to the trauma; Criterion F addresses the duration of the symptoms; and Criterion G includes clinical distress or impairment in important areas of functioning (e.g., occupational). The presenting symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance, including alcohol or medications.\n\nThe first part of the evolving PTSD definition is Criterion A ( ), which describes changes in the definition of a traumatic event from that of “a recognizable stressor,” to “an event that is outside the range of usual human experience,” to an event that is defined by two specific descriptors, to “exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.”\n\nExhibit L-1\n\nEvolution of Criterion A for PTSD in the DSM.\n\nCriterion B has also evolved. In the DSM-III (APA, 1980), it described reexperiencing a trauma through three symptoms: intrusive thoughts, recurrent dreams, or the feeling of reexperiencing the trauma as a result of some sort of stimulus. DSM-III-R (APA, 1987) expanded Criterion B by adding another symptom: “intense psychological distress at exposure to events that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event, including anniversaries of the trauma” (p. 250). It also added information regarding symptom presentations that may occur in children (e.g., repetitive play expressing aspects of the trauma). DSM-IV (APA, 1994) added a fifth symptom of “physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event” (p. 428) and additional symptom presentations that may occur in children (e.g., nightmares that lack recognizable features, reenactments of the trauma). Likewise, DSM-5 (2013) became more developmentally focused in diagnostic criteria and added a separate criterion for children younger than 7 years of age. Additional changes in the DSM-5 include a more explicit definition of the stressor criterion, an additional and separate symptom cluster highlighting avoidance and persistent negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and the elimination of an individual’s subjective reaction to the traumatic event (intense fear, helplessness, or horror).\n\nCriterion C addresses avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s). Criterion C evolved between DSM-III and DSM-III-R ( ), with only minimal changes in language in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (APA, 1994; 2000). The DSM-5 dropped the terminology of numbing of general responsiveness in this criterion’s heading (APA, 2013).\n\nExhibit L-2\n\nEvolution of Criterion C for PTSD in the DSM.\n\nCriterion D addresses symptoms related to negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s). This symptom cluster is a new addition to DSM-5 and includes “irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects; reckless or self-destructive behavior; hypervigilance; exaggerated startle response; problems with concentration; sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep)” (APA, 2013, p. 272). In prior DSM publications, criterion D related to increased arousal (e.g., difficulties with sleep and concentration). In DSM-5, this criterion has moved to Criterion E, with no other changes in symptoms. This criterion has also evolved from the description in the DSM-III to a more concise description in the DSM-III-R, and it has become even more concise in the DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, and DSM-5 ( ).\n\nExhibit L-3\n\nEvolution of Criterion E for PTSD in the DSM.\n\nA time criterion was added in the DSM-III-R (APA, 1987) to specify a minimum timeframe of 1 month or more for experiencing symptoms in Criteria B, C, D, and E. In the DSM-IV (APA, 1994), DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000), and DSM-5 (APA, 2013), this criterion was retained, with the slight change of requiring more than 1 month of symptoms (APA, 1994; 2000, 2013). The criterion that addresses the level of distress and functioning was not included until the publication of the DSM-IV (APA, 1994) and has remained the same in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). This criterion added a new defining characteristic, which specifies that “the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupation, or other important areas of functioning” (APA, 2013, p. 272).\n\nTurnbull (1998) describes the historical development of the idea of PTSD up to its inclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 9th Revision (1979) and the DSM-III-R. The DSM-5 recognizes certain specifiers that may further characterize PTSD (APA, 2013). For example, a specific case of PTSD may be with delayed expression (full criteria are not met until at least 6 months have passed since the trauma exposure, although the onset of symptoms may immediately follow the trauma; APA, 2000; 2013).\n\nWhat Is Partial PTSD?\n\nPartial PTSD is a category developed by researchers to evaluate people who have some impairment related to elevated PTSD symptoms but do not meet full criteria for the disorder. The term is commonly defined as either having at least one PTSD symptom from Criteria B, C, and D that lasts at least 1 month after a traumatic event (Criterion A) or as meeting Criterion A plus two of the other three criteria (Mylle & Maes, 2004). These authors also reviewed studies about the prevalence of partial PTSD according to both criteria. Partial PTSD has been associated with several of the same negative consequences associated with full PTSD, but not to the same extent as a full PTSD diagnosis (e.g., Pietrzak et al., 2011a).\n\nWhat Is TIC?\n\nIn the past 15 years, there have been many definitions of TIC and various models for incorporating it across organizations. This TIP uses SAMHSA’s definition of TIC, which describes this type of care involving “these key elements: (1) realizing the prevalence of trauma; (2) recognizing how trauma affects all individuals involved with the program, organization, or system, including its own workforce; and (3) responding by putting this knowledge into practice” (SAMHSA, Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative, 2012, p. 4). In a seminal article on the development of a trauma-informed service system, Harris and Fallot (2001) proposed that such a system is one in which administrators and staff understand how traumatic experiences negatively affect behavioral health in multiple ways and are committed to responding to those needs through universal trauma screening, staff education and training regarding trauma and its effects, and willingness to review and change policies and procedures to prevent the (re)traumatization of clients.\n\nAs part of the overall review of policies, practices, and research involving trauma-informed services for individuals who are homeless, Hopper, Bassuk, and Olivet (2010) reviewed the literature and organizational principles on TIC and found several common themes. These included an awareness of how symptoms and behaviors are related to traumatic experiences, an emphasis on safety, an opportunity for individuals to develop or regain a sense of control over their lives, and an emphasis on strengths rather than on deficiencies. They used these themes to develop the following definition of TIC (Hopper, Bassuk, & Olivet, 2010, p. 82):\n\nTrauma-Informed Care is a strengths-based framework that is grounded in an understanding of and responsiveness to the impact of trauma, that emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for both providers and survivors, and that creates opportunities for survivors to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment.”\n\nOther definitions of TIC exist, and Hopper and colleagues (2010) reviewed some of the better-known versions of these and presented them in a table (see ) for easy comparison.\n\nExhibit L-4\n\nPrinciples of TIC.\n\nElliott, Bjelajac, Fallot, Markoff, and Reed (2005) discussed TIC within the context of services for women and suggested some guiding principles for such services; they also briefly reviewed literature in support of those principles.\n\nWhat Is the Relationship of Culture to Traumatic Stress Reactions?\n\nAlthough cultural responses to trauma may vary, high PTSD rates have been diagnosed in a wide range of cultures following exposure to a significant traumatic event, including Ju’hoansi (i.e., Kalahari Bushmen) exposed to domestic violence, Cambodians who lived through the Khmer Rouge regime, survivors of the Rwandan genocide, and Filipinos who experienced a large-scale natural disaster (Marques, Robinaugh, LeBlanc, & Hinton, 2011). Neurobiological research also indicates that affect dysregulation, changes in right hemisphere functioning, and a kindling phenomenon occurs across cultures in individuals who have PTSD or a prolonged stress reaction as the result of trauma exposure (Wilson, 2007).\n\nMarsella and Christopher (2004) observed that intrusive PTSD symptoms appear to be more common cross-culturally than symptoms of avoidance or the reexperiencing of trauma and that the occurrence of the two latter categories of symptoms may vary considerably across cultures. Other international research indicates that the presentation and occurrence of specific PTSD symptoms and the rates of other mental disorders and/or symptoms following trauma vary considerably among nations/cultural groups (Marques et al., 2011). For example, research conducted with Vietnamese survivors of a typhoon found that both depression and panic disorder appeared to be more common responses to the trauma than PTSD (Amstadter et al., 2009). Other studies conducted with Vietnamese (Hinton et al., 2001) and Cambodian (Hinton, Ba, Peou, & Um, 2000) refugees have also found high rates of panic disorder/panic attacks co-occurring with PTSD among trauma survivors.\n\nMembers of some cultural groups may also have increased risk for PTSD, or for certain PTSD symptoms, compared with members of other groups. Research from the United States suggests that Latinos have greater risk for PTSD when trauma exposure is controlled for than African Americans, White Americans, or Asian Americans (e.g., see Marshall, Schell, & Miles, 2009). A study conducted in the Netherlands with a diverse group of individuals affected by an airline disaster found that those who came from non-Western cultures (n=379) experienced significantly more health-related anxieties, more severe PTSD symptoms, more fatigue, and more impaired health-related quality of life than did those from Western cultures (n=406; Verschuur, Maric, & Spinhoven, 2010). Other research conducted with refugees in Finland who were survivors of torture (N=78) found that those from southeastern European cultures had significantly more PTSD symptoms than did those from Middle Eastern, Central African, or Southern Asian cultures (Schubert & Punamäki, 2011).\n\nMarsella (2010), as part of a review of the ethnocultural aspects of PTSD, noted that culture may affect individuals’ responses to trauma by providing meaning to symptoms (e.g., nightmares), by shaping individuals’ beliefs about traumatic events (e.g., through different concepts of destiny or fate), by affecting individuals’ beliefs about their own responsibility for the trauma and their subsequent response, by indicating what disabilities or impairments may result from the trauma, and by shaping the threshold for normal versus pathological levels of arousal (e.g., through perceptions and interpretations of stressors). He also indicated that cultural beliefs may be used to help heal maladaptive responses to trauma. Hoshmand (2007) reviewed research that suggested the importance of understanding cultural sources of strength/resilience when interpreting trauma from a cultural perspective.\n\nBecause of these differences, members of certain cultural groups may not present symptoms in a manner that can be easily identified as PTSD or another behavioral health disorder. For instance, clinicians working with Cambodian refugees have observed that traumatic memories in the form of flashbacks or nightmares may be interpreted as attacks by dead spirits, whereas hyperarousal symptoms may indicate a physical or spiritual weakness (Hinton, Hinton, Pich, Loeum, & Pollack, 2009; Hinton, Park, Hsia, Hofmann, & Pollack, 2009). Hoshmand (2007) recommended taking an ecological approach to interpreting trauma, which means that traumatic experiences and trauma responses are interpreted within the context of the individual’s culture and with respect to other factors (e.g., gender, age) that might shape those responses.\n\nRole of acculturation\n\nAnother relevant concern is the degree to which acculturation affects responses to trauma. Research in this area is limited, but the preponderance of evidence seems to indicate that greater acculturation is associated with lower levels of PTSD symptoms (Dunlavy, 2010). This is contrary to the evidence relating acculturation, for some immigrant groups, to certain other behavioral health problems, notably substance abuse and depressive symptoms (e.g., Alegría et al., 2008; Gonzalez & Gonzalez, 2008; Grant et al., 2004; Xie & Greenman, 2005). In her own data analysis concerning African immigrants to Sweden, however, Dunlavy found no significant associations between acculturation and PTSD symptoms.\n\nA large study in this area was conducted in the Netherlands with a group of 221 immigrants affected by a large fireworks explosion and a matched group of 127 immigrants unaffected by the disaster (Drogendijk, van der Velden, & Kleber, 2012). The study found that lower acculturation (assessed with the Lowlands Acculturation Scale [LAS]) was associated with increased behavioral health problems for individuals who had experienced this trauma but not for those in the control group. Specifically, a greater need to keep the norms and values of one’s original culture (measured with a subscale of the LAS) was significantly associated with more intrusion and avoidance symptoms (indicative of PTSD), anxiety, depression, hostility, and somatic complaints for those affected by this trauma. For those unaffected, acculturation had no significant association with behavioral health measures, nor were other domains of acculturation significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, although having skills to cope with a new culture/society and feeling socially integrated into that society were associated with better outcomes in the other areas of behavioral health measures. The authors observed that their findings may indicate that, in the context of a disaster affecting large numbers of people, a lack of flexibility in terms of cultural norms and values may be a source of additional stress.\n\nThe role of acculturation vis-à-vis PTSD, however, may vary according to cultural group and the predominant culture’s relationship to that group (e.g., it may be different for immigrant and indigenous populations). For example, a study conducted in Taiwan with members of an aboriginal group affected by an earthquake (N=196) found that lower levels of acculturation to mainstream Taiwanese culture were associated with significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms following the disaster (Lee et al., 2009). Other studies indicate that a domain from the Demographic and Post-Migration Living Difficulty Questionnaire labeled “difficulties adjusting to cultural life” in a new society was also associated with greater PTSD symptom severity among refugees in studies in Australia (Schweitzer, Melville, Steel & Lacherez, 2006) and the United Kingdom (Carswell, Blackburn, & Barker, 2011). This domain, which evaluates feelings of isolation, loneliness, boredom, and a lack of access to preferred foods, may also represent difficulties in acculturation, as the sense of isolation may be greater among less acculturated refugees who are not able to establish social connections in their new culture.\n\nFor immigrants/refugees, better acquisition of the language of their new country, which may also represent greater acculturation, has also been associated with significantly lower levels of PTSD symptoms among Iraqi refugees living in Sweden (N=48) but not with significant differences in rates of PTSD diagnosis (Söndergaard & Theorell, 2004). Similarly, a study of Burmese refugees living in Australia (N=70) found a significant association between postmigration living difficulties, of which concern about communication problems was the most often-cited example, and PTSD symptoms (Schweitzer, Brough, Vromans, & Asic-Kobe, 2011).\n\nSchweitzer and colleagues (2006), in their study of 63 Sudanese refugees in Australia, also found that support from family and others within a Sudanese community was a significant resilience factor with regard to behavioral health, whereas social support from the larger Australian society was not. The planned TIP, Improving Cultural Competence (SAMHSA, planned c), includes more information on the role of acculturation in behavioral health disorders and their treatment.\n\nTypes of Trauma\n\nThere are numerous forms and types of trauma. In this section, the research reviewed explores a wide variety of traumas; however, the sheer volume of research available precludes a thorough review of each trauma type. In addition, the order of appearance in this document does not denote a specific trauma’s importance or prevalence, nor is a lack of relevance implied if a given trauma is not specifically addressed in this TIP. The intent of this section is to give the reader a broad science-based perspective on the types of trauma.\n\nAdverse Childhood Experiences\n\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs), often referred to as early childhood or interpersonal trauma, are childhood experiences that can have a negative effect on an individual’s well-being that often lasts into adulthood. These experiences include child abuse and neglect as well as substance abuse and mental illness in the family, having a family member incarcerated, and violence directed toward a parent (usually the mother; Dube et al., 2005). ACEs are associated with significant increases in a number of negative social, behavioral health, and physical health outcomes, including alcohol and drug use disorders, depression, suicidality, risky sexual behavior, sexual victimization in adulthood, domestic violence, self-harm behaviors, physical inactivity, obesity, heart disease, cancer, liver disease, sexually transmitted diseases, teen pregnancy, homelessness, unemployment, and being both a perpetrator and/or a victim of interpersonal violence (Dietz et al., 1999; Felitti et al., 1998; Herman, Susser, Struening, & Link, 1997; Hillis, Anda, Felitti, Nordenberg, & Marchbanks, 2000; Lalor & McElvaney, 2010; Noll, Horowitz, Bonanno, Trickett, & Putnam, 2003; Roberts, McLaughlin, Conron, & Koenen, 2011; Tam, Zlotnick, & Robertson, 2003).\n\nChildhood trauma also appears to be more likely to result in PTSD than trauma experienced in adulthood. Wrenn and colleagues (2011), using a largely African American, inner-city sample of people who had experienced trauma (N=767), found that childhood trauma was associated with significantly greater PTSD risk than trauma experienced in adulthood alone. Childhood abuse was associated with even greater risk than other trauma experienced in childhood.\n\nA major study evaluating the effects of ACEs was conducted with 17,421 members of a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in California in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Dube et al., 2005). Two rounds of questionnaires were given, with 7,641 respondents completing both assessments (Edwards, Anda, Felitti, & Dube, 2004). In the initial assessment, 29.9 percent of men and 27 percent of women reported experiencing physical abuse as children; 24.7 percent of women and 16 percent of men, sexual abuse; and 13.1 percent of women and 7.6 percent of men, emotional abuse (Dube et al., 2005). Also, 29.5 percent of women and 23.8 percent of men reported parental substance abuse, 23.3 percent of women and 14.8 percent of men reported parental mental illness, and 13.7 percent of women and 11.5 percent of men reported violence directed toward their mothers.\n\nThe NCS and NCS-R evaluated a similar group of 12 experiences, labeled childhood adversities (CAs), which included parental death, parental divorce/separation, life-threatening illness, and extreme economic hardship in addition to the experiences included in the ACE study (Green et al., 2010). In this sample, 8.4 percent reported childhood physical abuse; 6 percent, sexual abuse; 5.6 percent, neglect; 14 percent, family violence; 10.3 percent, parental mental illness; 8.5 percent, parental substance abuse; and 5.8 percent, life-threatening illness (Green et al., 2010).\n\nIn a multivariate model, almost all of the CAs evaluated in the NCS were associated with increased odds of having a mental disorder; the strongest associations were with parental mental illness, parental substance abuse, family violence, childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, and life-threatening illness (Green et al., 2010). These data also show a significant association between certain CAs (i.e., parental mental illness, substance abuse in the family, family violence, childhood physical/sexual abuse, childhood neglect, economic hardship) and the persistence of mental disorders (McLaughlin, Green, Gruber et al., 2010a). The associations of single trauma to mental disorders were modest, but multiple traumas had a cumulative effect, so that exposure to multiple CAs further increased the strength of the association with both onset and persistence of mental disorders. These same CAs were also significantly associated with functional impairment related to behavioral health disorders (McLaughlin et al., 2010b).\n\nAnother large study, the Developmental Victimization Survey, investigated forms of childhood abuse and maltreatment in 2,030 children and adolescents ages 2 to 17. The study found that 13.8 percent had sustained some form of maltreatment in the year of the survey; 10.3 percent, psychological/emotional abuse; 3.6 percent, physical abuse; 1.4 percent, neglect; and 0.6 percent, sexual abuse (Finkelhor, Ormord, Turner, & Hamby, 2005). However, some literature indicates that all these data underrepresent the extent of childhood abuse and neglect, as both research and expert opinion indicate that these traumas are generally underreported (see review by Gilbert et al., 2009).\n\nGilbert and colleagues (2009) specifically reviewed data on psychological abuse, which is not often evaluated in the literature. They found that approximately 10 percent of children in the United States and the United Kingdom experience psychological abuse in any given year, and between 4 and 9 percent sustain severe emotional abuse. Children who have sustained one type of abuse or neglect are likely to have experienced other types as well, according to research conducted with a variety of samples (see reviews by Edwards et al., 2003; Gilbert et al., 2009).\n\nResearch indicates that women are much more likely to sustain sexual abuse than men. Some studies have found that men are more likely than women to sustain physical abuse in childhood (e.g., Dube et al., 2005), whereas others did not find significant differences (e.g., Finkelhor et al., 2005). Although childhood sexual abuse is more common for women than for men, research evaluating outcomes for both genders has, for the most part, found similar long-term consequences for men and women (Banyard, Williams, & Siegel, 2004; Dube et al., 2005).\n\nResearch also indicates that children living in households with yearly incomes of $20,000 or less (in 2003–2004) are significantly more likely than children from other households to experience psychological/emotional abuse, but not physical or sexual abuse (Finkelhor et al., 2005). According to the same study, children from low-income families are also significantly more likely to witness domestic violence and violence in their communities, and they are significantly more likely to sustain violent assault or rape not perpetrated by a family member. Other research has also found that children who are maltreated, especially those who sustain physical abuse, are more likely to be exposed to violence in their communities and to witness domestic violence; these latter traumatic experiences have specific negative effects on children’s functioning beyond those associated with abuse/neglect (Lynch & Cicchetti, 1998).\n\nDifferent types of childhood abuse may have different behavioral health effects. In a study of 196 clients in treatment for alcohol dependence, a history of emotional abuse in childhood was associated with a significant increase in risk for mood disorders (especially major depression) and PTSD, physical abuse in childhood was associated with a significant increase in suicide attempts, and sexual abuse in childhood was associated with significant increases in risk for anxiety disorders, including PTSD (Huang, Schwandt, Ramchandani, George, & Heilig, 2012). A study of 140 women found that those who experienced sexual abuse in childhood were significantly more likely to engage in self-harm behaviors, those who sustained emotional abuse were significantly more likely to be victims of sexual assault/rape in adulthood, and those who were neglected in childhood were significantly more likely to be victims of physical abuse in adulthood (Noll et al., 2003).\n\nMore so than other ACEs, physical and sexual abuse in childhood are associated with even greater and more lasting problems, including significantly higher rates of depression, substance use disorders, and PTSD in later life (see review by Gilbert et al., 2009). In addition, Gilbert and colleagues (2009) found strong evidence linking childhood abuse with suicide attempts, high-risk sexual behavior, criminal behavior, and obesity. As one seminal article on the effects of childhood trauma observes, “deficits in virtually all of the major tasks of development” can result from such abuse in childhood (Lynch & Cicchetti, 1998, p. 238). A more recent analysis of NCS-R data that controlled for other anxiety disorders, depression, and demographic factors also found that childhood sexual abuse was associated with significantly greater risk for social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), in addition to PTSD, in adulthood (Cougle, Timpano, Sachs-Ericsson, Keough, & Riccardi, 2010). Physical abuse in childhood, however, was only associated with significantly higher risk for specific phobias and PTSD.\n\nAbuse during childhood also appears to predispose individuals to further abuse and trauma as they grow older. Sexual abuse in childhood and the severity of such abuse have been shown in a number of studies to be significantly associated with a greater risk for sexual abuse in adulthood (see review by Classen, Palesh, & Aggarwal, 2005). Physical abuse in childhood, to a lesser degree, is also associated with an increased risk for sexual abuse in adulthood (Classen et al., 2005). Women who were physically abused as children are at greater risk for being victims of domestic violence, whereas men who were physically abused are at greater risk for being perpetrators of domestic violence (Whitfield, Anda, Dube, & Felitti, 2003). This study, which used data from the ACE study described previously, did not assess the relationship of child abuse to violence perpetrated by women or sustained by men.\n\nIn addition to likely contributing to behavioral health disorders, childhood abuse may also affect behavioral health treatment outcomes. Research conducted with 146 women who were homeless and had substance use disorders found that those who had histories of childhood abuse (physical, sexual, and/or emotional) had significantly worse outcomes in terms psychological functioning (assessed with multiple instruments) and substance abuse (assessed with an instrument derived from the Addiction Severity Index [ASI]; Sacks, McKendrick, & Banks, 2008). More information on the relationship between childhood abuse/neglect and substance abuse in adulthood can be found in TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse and Neglect Issues (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT], 2000).\n\nFord (2009) reviewed the neurobiological and development research that helps explain how trauma experienced in childhood can affect the brain and how those effects may continue throughout a person’s lifetime (see also earlier work, Anda et al., 2006). More recent studies confirm this research. As one example, Dannlowski and colleagues (2012) found strong associations between childhood maltreatment (assessed retrospectively using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and both decreased gray-matter volume in a number of areas of the brain and increased response in the amygdala upon seeing pictures of threatening facial expressions.\n\nSchumm, Briggs-Phillips, and Hobfoll (2006) reviewed three theories on why sexual abuse in childhood has extensive and lasting negative effects: these individuals develop a generalized fear response as a result of their inability to control or predict abuse, and this leaves them unable to emotionally engage in interpersonal relationships; they feel worthless and perceive others as disapproving of them; and/or they become easy targets for exploitative social networks, which further harm their ability to trust. The authors noted that these patterns together may contribute to problems with interpersonal relationships, which in turn affect behavioral health.\n\nDisasters/Mass Trauma\n\nLarge-scale traumatic events like natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes), human disasters (e.g., chemical spills, nuclear accidents), and terrorist attacks have unique effects because of the number of people affected and the fact that whole communities/populations may experience consequences (Norris, Friedman, & Watson, 2002). In addition to affecting behavioral health, such traumatic events often involve multiple losses, including the loss of lives (of friends and family), home, occupation/employment, health/physical well-being, and even one’s worldview (such events may affect one’s sense of security or beliefs about the justice of the world; Walsh, 2007).\n\nNot all disasters/mass trauma incidents appear to have the same effect on people’s behavioral health. In their review of 160 studies of mass trauma events, Norris and colleagues (2002) found that rates of serious psychological impairment (measured with a number of different instruments) were significantly higher for individuals who endured trauma from mass violence (e.g., terrorist attacks) than for those who experienced a technological or natural disaster. Severe impairment was also more common if the event occurred in a developing (rather than developed) country, and, in most studies, if the individual who experienced the event was female rather than male.\n\nDiGrande, Neria, Brackbill, Pulliam, and Galea (2010) assessed PTSD symptoms for 3,271 individuals evacuated from the World Trade Center on 9/11 by phone interview (and by face-to-face interview for 5 percent of the sample) 2 to 3 years after the event. They found that 95.6 percent had at least one PTSD symptom and 15 percent had probable PTSD according to their scores on the PTSD Checklist (PCL), Stressor-Specific Version. Specific experiences associated with significantly higher odds for PTSD included witnessing a horrific incident (e.g., the airplane hitting the towers, people falling from the building, people who were injured or killed), being injured in the attack, being exposed to the dust cloud that resulted from the building collapse, being above the impact zone when the attack occurred, and evacuating later rather than earlier.\n\nAnother study of people affected by the 9/11 attacks that used a national sample (n=933 respondents to the 2-month follow-up assessment; n=787 respondents to the 6-month assessment) and a Web-based survey also found that 17 percent reported at least one ASD/PTSD symptom 2 months after the 9/11 attack; 5.8 percent reported at least one symptom 6 months after the attack (Silver, Holman, McIntosh et al., 2002). Individuals were significantly more likely to report symptoms if they were female, were separated/divorced/widowed, had a diagnosed depressive or anxiety disorder, had a physical illness, had disengaged from coping efforts, and/or had greater exposure to the actual attacks. The authors concluded that individuals need not be directly exposed to mass trauma events for those events to have a negative effect on their behavioral health.\n\nNorris and colleagues (2002) reviewed information on risk and protective factors associated with behavioral health disorders and symptoms for survivors of natural disasters and those caused by people drawn from 160 studies published between 1981 and 2001. For the most part, these are the same as found with other populations of trauma survivors, with possible exceptions being the presence of children, which is a risk factor for anxiety in mothers involved in disasters (fathers were not studied in the four articles reviewed), and the loss of material resources, which has been found to be a risk factor for behavioral health disorder symptoms in survivors of disasters but is rarely evaluated in studies involving other types of trauma. Such losses also appear to have a greater effect on older adults involved in disasters (see the “People in Specific Age Groups” section).\n\nDomestic Violence/Intimate Partner Violence\n\nDomestic violence or intimate partner violence, also referred as interpersonal trauma, is a major source of trauma for women (and can affect men as well) and carries with it a high risk for PTSD (Coker, Weston, Creson, Justice, & Blakeney, 2005). Between 2001 and 2005, intimate partner violence accounted for 21.5 percent of nonfatal violence against women and 3.6 percent of violence against men (Catalano, 2012). Rates of domestic violence are high for people with behavioral health disorders, especially people with substance use disorders.\n\nCoker and colleagues (2005) evaluated data regarding links between intimate partner violence and PTSD taken from the National Violence Against Women Survey, a large national household survey of 8,000 women and 8,000 men conducted in the mid-1990s (see Tjaden & Thoennes [2000] for more information on the study). Among a subsample of men and women who were survivors of intimate partner violence (368 women, 185 men), PTSD rates were high, with 24 percent of the women and 20 percent of the men having moderate to severe levels of PTSD symptoms, indicating possible current PTSD (although rates of possible PTSD were higher for women, the difference between genders was not significant). The authors also found that higher socioeconomic status (SES), current marriage, and the cessation of intimate partner violence were all associated with significantly lower odds of having elevated PTSD symptoms.\n\nResearch from Spain suggests a dose–response relationship between intimate partner violence and PTSD (Pico-Alfonso, 2005); although physical, sexual, and psychological abuse from partners were all significantly related to PTSD, the latter had the strongest relationship.\n\nPolitical Violence/Torture\n\nTrauma from political violence and torture varies considerably across the globe and is common among some refugee groups (Johnson & Thompson, 2008). Histories of torture are also common among smaller populations, such as former prisoners of war (Engdahl, Dikel, Eberly, & Blank, 1997). Accurate data on the prevalence of such trauma in the United States is difficult to obtain, because most major surveys do not inquire specifically about it.\n\nBecause of the high degree of interpersonal violence involved, political violence and torture often result in traumatic stress reactions that pose particular problems for providers in terms of treatment and assessment. In Steel and colleagues’ (2009) meta-analysis of research on trauma and traumatic stress among refugees and others exposed to mass conflict and political violence, of all the experiences evaluated, torture was associated with the greatest increase in PTSD risk (more than doubling the odds of having PTSD).\n\nJohnson and Thompson (2008) reviewed literature on the prevalence of PTSD among survivors of political and civilian war trauma. They cited studies involving torture survivors that found PTSD rates ranging from 18 to 90 percent of study participants. They observed evidence of a dose–response relationship between torture and both initiation and maintenance of PTSD. This review suggests that protective factors for PTSD that results from torture and civilian war trauma include being prepared for torture, having strong social and family support, and having stronger religious beliefs.\n\nSome theories hold that having redress for torture and other political violence may help survivors process their traumatic experiences and thus aid in behavioral health treatment (e.g., Roht-Arriaza, 1995). However, Başoğlu and colleagues (2005) found only a relatively weak association between the lack of redress for war-related trauma and PTSD symptoms among a group of 1,358 civilian war survivors in the former Yugoslavia. Fears about threats to one’s safety and beliefs about losing control over one’s life had much stronger associations with PTSD symptoms.\n\nThe role of forgiveness in the behavioral health of survivors of torture and other political violence may depend on the context of the violence and the object of forgiveness. Kira and colleagues (2009) found, among a group of 501 Iraqi refugees, that those who forgave perpetrators of violence in general as well as those who collaborated with the regime (as measured with a modified version of the Forgiveness Versus Refusal To Forgive Scale) had significantly better physical and behavioral health than did those who did not forgive those people. On the other hand, forgiveness of dictators and specific individuals who were the principal perpetrators of the violence was associated with significantly worse physical and behavioral health outcomes.\n\nSexual Assault/Rape\n\nIn 2010, 1.3 percent of women age 12 and older were victims of sexual assault/rape, and it was estimated that, in the general population, about 0.1 percent of men were victims—although there were not sufficient data to be certain of the accuracy of that estimate (Truman, 2011). These data are based on a general population survey that excluded the institutionalized population, which sustains even higher rates of sexual assault/rape. For example, from 2008 to 2009, 4.4 percent of prison inmates were victims of sexual assault (Beck & Harrison, 2010). Although women are more likely than men to be sexually assaulted even in prison, there are about 13 times as many men as women in such facilities, so a large number of incarcerated men are affected. Among prison inmates in 2008–2009, 1.9 percent of men and 4.7 percent of women reported being sexually victimized by other inmates in the prior year, whereas 2.9 percent of men and 2.1 percent of women reported being sexually victimized by staff members during that period.\n\nHistories of sexual abuse among clinical populations are also likely to be considerably more common than in the general population (e.g., see TIP 51, Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of Women [CSAT, 2009b], for a review of data on sexual assault among female clients in substance abuse treatment settings). Certain other populations, including survivors of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse, people with disabilities, and people who are homeless, also have a higher risk for sexual assault (Luce, Schrager, & Gilchrist, 2010).\n\nAccurate data on sexual assault among patients institutionalized for mental disorders are difficult to locate, but rates of sexual assault should be expected to be high in this group as well. According to a study by Teplin, McClelland, Abram, and Weiner (2005) of 936 patients with serious mental illness (SMI) attending outpatient residential day treatment at a Chicago program, participants were 17.2 times more likely to have been victims of sexual assault or rape in the prior year and 22.5 times more likely to have been victims of rape than a comparable general population sample from the National Crime Victimization Survey during the same period.\n\nStudies have also found very high PTSD rates among survivors of sexual assault, especially survivors of rape, and data suggest that sexual assault is more likely than most other types of trauma to result in PTSD (see reviews in Ullman & Filipas, 2001). In addition, sexual abuse in adulthood or childhood is also associated with high levels of other behavioral health disorders. In a meta-analytic review of 37 studies providing data on 3,162,318 individuals, Chen and colleagues (2010) found that a history of sexual abuse in childhood or adulthood was associated with more than three times the risk for an anxiety disorder compared with individuals who had no such history; more than twice the risk for depression, an eating disorder, or PTSD; and more than four times the risk for suicide attempts.\n\nUllman and Filipas (2001) reviewed research identifying factors associated with increased risk for PTSD among victims of sexual assault/rape. These include being attacked by a stranger, being subjected to physical force or threatened with a weapon, being physically injured, having a prior history of childhood sexual abuse, being raped in a location typically considered safe, using wishful thinking as a coping strategy in response to the attack, and receiving fewer community services and/or experiencing a high degree of secondary victimization following the attack. On the other hand, the use of positive distancing (e.g., acceptance coping, optimism, cognitive distancing) was associated with lower PTSD risk.\n\nIn their own research on 332 women who had been sexually assaulted, Ullman and Filipas (2001) determined that, although positive social reactions following the assault were not significantly associated with severe PTSD symptoms, more negative responses from others were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms. In particular, being treated differently or being discriminated against showed the strongest association with more severe PTSD, and responses in which people tried to distract the victim (e.g., telling her to move on with her life) showed less severity but were still significantly linked with more severe PTSD. Positive social support was not significantly related to PTSD symptom severity, but some factors were identified as significantly associated with more positive social support—namely, lower severity of victimization and disclosing more about the assault (discussing it at greater length and/or in more detail). Greater injury severity and a greater perceived threat at the time of the assault were also associated with significantly more severe PTSD symptoms.\n\nCombat Trauma\n\nBecause of the resources available to the military (including the ability to compile accurate data about a relatively large population), combat trauma is one of the most widely studied types of trauma in terms of behavioral health. For more information on the impact of trauma and deployment, see the planned TIP, Reintegration-Related Behavioral Health Issues in Veterans and Military Families (SAMHSA, planned f). This section summarizes information available in more detail in that TIP.\n\nAccording to the largest study of PTSD among Vietnam War veterans, the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS), 15.2 percent of male veterans had current PTSD, and 30.6 percent met criteria for PTSD at some point during their lives (Kulka et al., 1990b). In addition, 8.5 percent of women who were in the Vietnam theater as civilian nurses had current PTSD, and 26.9 percent had PTSD at some point during their lives. These rates were considerably higher than rates in veterans from that era who did not serve in Vietnam (of whom 2.5 percent of men and 1.1 percent of women had current PTSD) or a civilian comparison group that was also included in the study.\n\nA later reanalysis of NVVRS data, which took into account criticisms of the initial study, provided a more conservative estimate of 9.1 percent of men having current PTSD and 18.7 percent meeting criteria for the disorder at some point during their lives (Dohrenwend et al., 2006, 2007). These authors found that, even for individuals who had substantial impairment relating to PTSD symptoms, PTSD diagnoses decreased over a 10- to 11-year period following the war; for the majority, this occurred without receiving mental health services. The NVVRS also found that war zone stress, which included combat trauma and exposure to other traumatic events, was also significantly related to major depression, dysthymia, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), GAD, alcohol use disorders, and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) for men (Jordan et al. 1991). The majority (63 percent) of male veterans who had high levels of exposure to war zone stress met criteria for at least one mental disorder during their lives, and 41 percent had at least one current disorder at the time of assessment.\n\nStudies of military personnel who served in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) also found high rates of PTSD and other behavioral health disorders among those exposed to combat. For instance, the National Health Survey of Gulf War Era Veterans and Their Families, conducted 5 years after Operation Desert Storm ended, found that the PTSD rate was three times higher for deployed troops than for nondeployed troops during the same period, with 12.1 percent of deployed troops having probable current PTSD according to the PCL (Kang, Natelson, Mahan, Lee, & Murphy, 2003). This study found a correlation between a greater intensity of combat exposure and greater likelihood of having PTSD.\n\nSeveral major studies have evaluated behavioral health disorders among individuals deployed to OEF/OIF. For example, a review included in a RAND Center for Military Health Policy Research report found that between 5 and 15 percent of returning service members had current PTSD, and between 2 and 10 percent had current depression (Karney, Ramchand, Osilla, Caldarone, & Burns, 2008). Combat duty and being wounded both significantly increased the chances that an individual would have PTSD. Although greater numbers of women were exposed to combat trauma in OEF/OIF than in prior conflicts, studies also continued to find higher PTSD rates in men than in women who had been deployed, with rates of 9.3 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively, in one large (N=163,812) study (Haskell et al., 2011).\n\nHistorical Trauma\n\nHistorical trauma refers to trauma inflicted in the past on members of a certain cultural group that may continue to have effects on the current generation. The concept was originally developed to help explain how generations descended from Holocaust survivors continued to be psychologically affected by the trauma their parents and/or grandparents had experienced (Duran et al., 1998; Sotero, 2006). Clinicians working with other populations, such as Native Americans, observed a similar pattern with regard to how the behavioral health of more recent generations continued to be affected by violence committed against their ancestors (Brave Heart, 2003, 2004; Duran, Duran, Brave Heart, & Yellow Horse-Davis, 1998). Other groups who experienced large-scale and well-remembered violence, such as attempted genocide or slavery, also have to deal with historical trauma.\n\nThe phenomenon has been studied most often in the United States with Native American populations, and for many Native Americans receiving behavioral health services, historical trauma may be an important clinical issue (Brave Heart, 2004; Evans-Campbell, 2008). Some research indicates that thinking about historical loss is associated with certain behavioral health problems, such as increased risk for alcohol use disorders (Whitbeck et al., 2004). Although the exact mechanism through which historical trauma works is not known, the process may be one in which subsequent generations experience secondary trauma as the result of their parents’ PTSD. Another explanation is that traumatic experiences harm an individual’s ability to parent effectively and thus increase the abuse of children, causing those children to have traumatic stress reactions themselves (Brave Heart, 1999). Some research also points to substance abuse connected to trauma as central in the perpetuation of historical trauma (Libby, Orton, Beals, Buchwald, & Manson, 2008).\n\nSotero (2006), who reviewed research on historical trauma across diverse populations, proposed that large-scale interpersonal trauma continues to affect communities/cultural groups through material (e.g., displacement), psychological (e.g., PTSD), economic (e.g., loss of sources of income/sustenance), and cultural (e.g., lost knowledge of traditions and beliefs) effects. These powerful effects of trauma cause the next generation to experience similar consequences, resulting in worse coping skills or attempts to self-medicate distress through substance abuse.\n\nCumulative Trauma\n\nKessler (2000) observed that large epidemiological surveys typically ask about the worst or most severe trauma an individual has endured, with the assumption that if the individual has had PTSD, it would appear after such a trauma. This approach may undercount lifetime prevalence, however, because further trauma following the worst episode of trauma exposure may have a kindling effect that results in PTSD a considerable length of time after the worst episode occurred.\n\nThus, repeated trauma further increases risk for PTSD, and prior trauma is recognized as a PTSD risk factor following a traumatic event (see the “Risk and Protective Factors” section). For example, research conducted with inner-city women (N=777) found that women who had experienced multiple traumas significantly increased their risk for PTSD (Schumm, Briggs-Phillips, & Hobfoll, 2006). Therefore, women who had experienced child abuse and also had been raped as adults were over 17 times more likely than others to be screened as probably having PTSD, whereas women who had experienced only one of those two types of trauma were about six times more likely than others to meet screening criteria for probable PTSD.\n\nStudies conducted with other populations have also found that greater exposure to traumatic events increases risk for a number of behavioral health disorders. For example, a seminal study conducted with Cambodian refugees (N=993) found a significant dose–response relationship between the number of traumatic events an individual had experienced and depression, PTSD symptoms (including arousal, reexperiencing, and emotional numbing, but not avoidance), and symptoms of culturally specific behavioral health disorders (Mollica, McInnes, Poole, & Tor, 1998).\n\nExtent and Effects of Trauma and Traumatic Stress Reactions in Specific Populations\n\nThe incidence and prevalence of trauma and of behavioral health problems related to trauma vary across demographic groups. Some of the major demographic differences that may affect trauma exposure and behavioral health are discussed in this section.\n\nMembers of Specific Cultural/Ethnic/Racial Groups\n\nRates of trauma exposure among some samples of members of certain cultural, ethnic, and racial groups are higher than the U.S. average. To what extent this reflects socioeconomic and geographic factors is not clear, as other data indicate that people in urban areas and those with lower SES are also at greater risk for certain types of trauma (see “People With Lower SES”). Researchers have found that PTSD rates vary considerably among diverse cultures and that rates are high among people exposed to significant trauma, regardless of their culture of origin (Marques et al., 2011).\n\nAccording to data from Wave 2 of NESARC (N=34,653), which oversampled to achieve a racially/ethnically diverse sample, non-Latino White Americans were significantly more likely to have some trauma experience during their lives compared with members of other ethnic/racial groups, with 83.7 percent of White Americans, 76.4 percent of African Americans, 66.4 percent of Asian Americans, and 68.2 percent of Latinos reporting some type of trauma exposure during their lives (Roberts et al., 2011). However, this did not hold true for every type of trauma exposure. African Americans and Latinos were significantly more likely than White Americans to have been exposed to childhood maltreatment, with the largest difference being the increased likelihood of witnessing domestic violence. African Americans were significantly more likely than White Americans to have been violently assaulted. Asian Americans, who had significantly lower levels of exposure than White Americans to many kinds of trauma, were significantly more likely to have been exposed to war-related trauma (mostly as the result of being unarmed civilians in a combat zone) and to be refugees from a region where combat was occurring.\n\nAmong certain subpopulations of major ethnic/racial groups, trauma exposure may be even more common. For example, Goldmann and colleagues (2011) assessed trauma histories of 1,306 African American residents of Detroit, the majority of whom had annual incomes below $35,000 (34.6 percent below $15,000, and 27 percent between $15,000 and $35,000). They found that 87.2 percent reported at least one type of trauma during their lives; 51 percent reported experiencing assaultive violence, 64.5 percent reported another type of injury or shocking experience (e.g., witnessing someone being seriously injured or killed), and 64 percent reported learning about trauma from a loved one. Of those who reported at least one trauma, 17 percent likely had PTSD at some point during their lives, with a higher rate of likely PTSD for individuals experiencing certain types of trauma (e.g., 32.8 percent of those who had been raped and 31.2 percent of those who had been badly beaten had a lifetime PTSD diagnosis).\n\nIn Wave 2 of NESARC, African American men were significantly more likely than White American men to have PTSD at some point during their lives, but this was not the case for African American women (Roberts et al., 2010). According to the same research, Asian American men and women were significantly less likely than White American men and women to meet criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. Asnaani, Richey, Dimaite, Hinton, and Hofmann (2010) combined data from the NCS-R and two other surveys that use the same methodology (the National Study of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Study of Mental Health) to evaluate the lifetime prevalence of PTSD. Their data indicated that, after controlling for age, gender, and SES, both White Americans and African Americans were significantly more likely than Asian Americans or Latino Americans to have PTSD at some point during their lives, whereas White Americans and African Americans did not differ from one another significantly in this regard. Latino Americans were also significantly more likely than Asian Americans to have the disorder.\n\nAs Norris and Slone (2007) observed in their chapter on the epidemiology of PTSD, data are inconclusive about whether there are significant differences in the likelihood that members of diverse racial/ethnic/cultural groups within the United States will develop PTSD, especially given differences in trauma exposure relating to both culture and SES. Marques and colleagues (2011), in a review of cross-cultural differences in anxiety disorders, observed that the evidence is mixed regarding differences in PTSD prevalence between African Americans and White Americans. They concluded that the evidence is stronger regarding elevated levels of PTSD among Latinos compared with members of other ethnic racial groups. Another review by Pole, Gone, and Kulkarni (2008) similarly concluded that evidence fairly consistently suggests that Latinos are more likely than members of other ethnic/cultural groups to develop PTSD but that significant differences in PTSD rates observed among other ethnic/racial/cultural groups in the United States tend to disappear when other factors, such as trauma exposure, are taken into account.\n\nResearch indicating significantly higher PTSD rates among Latino populations in the United States is worth a closer look. Research conducted with Vietnam veterans, a group for whom trauma exposure can be fairly accurately determined, identified Latinos as having greater risk for PTSD, and this finding was confirmed in later analyses of the data. Ruef, Litz, and Schlenger (2000) analyzed data from the NVVRS, a large, publicly mandated study that oversampled for Latinos and African Americans. Although the NVVRS found that PTSD rates were higher among both Latino veterans (27.9 percent of whom had PTSD at the time of the study) and African American veterans (20.6 percent) than among White American or other veterans (13.7 percent), after controlling for combat exposure and significant predeployment variables that affected PTSD (e.g., childhood behavioral problems, substance use disorder symptoms prior to entering the military), only Latino veterans still had significantly higher PTSD rates.\n\nRuef, Litz, and Schlenger’s analysis (2000) of the extensive NVVRS data took into account issues such as linguistic competence in English, cultural differences in reporting style, experiences of racism during deployment, postdeployment adjustment problems, participation in behavioral health treatment, and co-occurring disorders. Most of these factors could not explain differences in PTSD rates between Latinos and African Americans, the latter of whom faced many of the same stressors. Latinos in the study reported experiencing less racism than did African Americans, but they may have also experienced less unit cohesion because of their smaller relative numbers (unit cohesion is also believed to be a protective factor in regard to PTSD; see the “Risk and Protective Factors” section). The authors did find that Latinos reported significantly fewer people in their units who they believed were concerned about their welfare than did African Americans or White Americans.\n\nUsing both NVVRS data and data from the Hawaii Vietnam Veterans Project, Schnurr, Lunney, Sengupta, and Waelde (2003) concluded that Latino male veterans had significantly higher PTSD rates compared with White men, whereas Asian American male veterans had significantly lower rates. This finding suggests that the higher PTSD rates observed in Latinos in Vietnam were not simply the result of greater identification with the Vietnamese. Also, in another analysis of NVVRS data, Ortega and Rosenheck (2001) found that acculturation did not significantly affect PTSD rates among Latinos, discounting the possible explanation that differences in acculturation were responsible for higher PTSD rates in this population. They did, however, find that in an adjusted model, Puerto Rican veterans were more likely than Mexican American veterans to have PTSD, suggesting that cultural differences among Latinos may affect PTSD. Wilcox, Briones, and Suess (1991) also found that Puerto Rican Vietnam veterans had more severe PTSD symptoms than did Mexican American veterans.\n\nResearch conducted with veterans of OIF and OEF also indicates that Latinos are at greater risk of developing PTSD than members of other ethnic/cultural groups. Researchers at the RAND Center found that, for OEF/OIF veterans, Latino ethnicity and female gender were both associated with increased risk for depression and PTSD, even after controlling for trauma exposure (Tanielian et al., 2008).\n\nLatinos have been found to have higher PTSD rates relative to members of other ethnic/racial groups in research conducted with other populations, including New York city residents who witnessed the 9/11 attack (Galea et al., 2004), police officers in three major cities (Pole et al., 2001; 2005), and hurricane survivors in Florida (Perilla, Norris, & Lavizzo, 2002). However, among a group of people who were exposed to hurricanes in Florida in 2004, Latino ethnicity was only a significant PTSD risk factor for those under age 60, suggesting that age may also interact with culture in affecting PTSD (Acierno, Ruggiero, Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Galea, 2006).\n\nPole and colleagues (2008) reviewed possible explanations for why Latinos have elevated PTSD rates. Two explanations appear to have the greatest support: culturally defined differences in coping styles (Latinos appear to engage more in self-blame coping and wishful thinking coping, generally related to religious beliefs) and increased likelihood of experiencing peritraumatic dissociation, a possible PTSD risk factor that appears to be a more common reaction to trauma for individuals with greater adherence to Latino cultural norms.\n\nMarshall and colleagues (2009) evaluated differences in PTSD symptoms among a mostly male (77.6 percent male across the study) group of Latinos (n=330), African Americans (n=171), and non-Latino White Americans (n=135) who had sustained a sudden physical injury and were treated at a trauma center in the Los Angeles area. As with other studies, these authors found that Latinos reported significantly more severe PTSD symptoms (with a difference equivalent to about a 3-point increase in PCL scores) than African Americans and non-Latino White Americans. However, they also observed that certain PTSD symptoms were responsible for this difference. Of the 17 symptoms included on the PCL, Latinos were significantly more likely than non-Latino White Americans to report 11 of the symptoms, with considerable variation in the magnitude of the differences. As Triffleman and Pole (2010) observed in a review of this study, these findings suggest that “elevated rates of PTSD diagnosis among [Latinos] may be due to differing symptoms, differing levels of symptom severity, and potentially differing relationships between symptoms” compared with non-Latino White Americans (p. 492).\n\nParticular types of trauma may have a greater or lesser impact on members of a particular cultural group. For instance, Palinkas, Downs, Patterson, & Russell (1993) found that in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster, Alaska Natives exposed to the event had significantly higher PTSD and GAD rates than did White Americans who were also exposed. Lilly and Graham-Bermann (2009) evaluated PTSD in 120 mothers with low incomes who were victims of intimate partner violence, of whom 42 were African American and 78 were White American. The women in the study had experienced multiple traumas in the prior year (an average of 36 acts of sexual abuse, 10 acts of severe physical violence, and 17 acts of mild physical violence). The authors found that the African American women in the study had significantly fewer PTSD symptoms (as assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Scale for Family Violence) than did the White American women, even though African American women had experienced more severe violence (although not significantly more so) than the White American women.\n\nResearch has also found that the relationship of different types of childhood abuse to PTSD symptoms varies by cultural group. Among a group of 669 lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals, emotional abuse in childhood had a significantly stronger relationship to PTSD and other anxiety symptoms for African Americans compared with White Americans, whereas physical abuse in childhood had a significantly stronger relationship to PTSD and other anxiety symptoms for Latinos than for White Americans (Balsam, Lehavot, Beadnell, & Circo, 2010). International research also indicates that, in Turkey and India, childhood emotional abuse and neglect have a greater effect on dissociation than physical or sexual abuse, which is contrary to what is found in the United States (Lewis-Fernández, Martínez-Taboas, Sar, Patel, & Boatin, 2007).\n\nTrauma rates vary by subpopulations within these broad cultural, racial, and ethnic classifications and may be affected more strongly by noncultural factors (e.g., amount of trauma exposure). For instance, data suggest that PTSD rates are relatively low for Asian Americans (e.g., Pietrzak et al., 2011a), but among Cambodian refugees, PTSD rates are considerably higher. Marshall, Schell, Elliott, Berthold, and Chun (2005), in a telephone survey of 586 Cambodian adults living in Long Beach, CA, found that 100 percent had experienced trauma, and 62 percent met criteria for a past-year diagnosis of PTSD.\n\nAs another example, the American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Risk and Protective Factors Project (AI-SUPERPFP), which collected data from 3,084 American Indians ages 15 to 54 who were members of either a Northern Plains Tribe or a Southwest Tribe, found significant differences in some types of trauma exposure between American Indians from the two different regions (Manson, Beals, Klein, & Croy, 2005). PTSD rates also varied, although the differences were not significant; the largest difference found was between men from the Southwestern Tribes (11.7 percent of whom met criteria for PTSD during their lifetime) and men from the Northern Plains Tribes (8.9 percent of whom had lifetime PTSD; Beals, Manson, Whitesell, Spicer, Mitchell et al., 2005). Larger, but still not significant, differences were found in lifetime PTSD rates between male American Indian Vietnam veterans from the Northern Plains Tribes (n=305) and those from the Southwestern Tribes (n=316), who had lifetime rates of 57 percent and 45 percent respectively (Beals et al., 2002). These rates, however, were considerably higher than found in the general population sample of Beals, Manson, Whitesell, Spicer, Novins, and colleagues (2005), indicating that factors other than cultural background (in this case, combat exposure) likely play a greater role in trauma exposure and traumatic stress reactions.\n\nAs suggested by the example of Cambodian American immigrants, rates of trauma are high among immigrants from countries where military action and political violence are occurring, regardless of their specific cultural background. Steel and colleagues (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of trauma and traumatic stress reactions among groups exposed to mass conflict and displacement. Although reported rates of PTSD and depression varied widely among the studies included in the review, the authors found that, across surveys, 30.6 percent of participants had PTSD, and 30.8 percent had depression.\n\nWomen and Men\n\nResearch generally indicates that men are more likely than women to experience a traumatic event during their lives (Olff, Langeland, Draijer, & Gersons, 2007). However, data from multiple sources show that women are significantly more likely than men to experience intimate partner violence and sexual assault (both in childhood and dulthood; Pratchett, Pelcovitz, & Yehuda, 2010). This same review found that various research suggests that between 20 and 22 percent of women experience intimate partner violence, and approximately a quarter of all women are victims of sexual assault. Women are significantly less likely than men, however, to experience many other types of trauma, including nonsexual assault, combat, traumatic accidents, and witnessing the death or injury of another person.\n\nResearch has consistently found that women are more likely than men to have PTSD, and this holds true, albeit to a lesser extent, when controlling for trauma exposure (Kimerling, Ouimette, & Weitlauf, 2007; Olff et al., 2007). For example, data from Wave 2 of NESARC showed that women were significantly more likely than men to have PTSD or partial PTSD at some point during their lives (Pietrzak et al., 2011a). Women were nearly twice as likely as men to have a lifetime PTSD diagnosis, with 8.6 percent of women and 4.1 percent of men meeting those criteria. Women were also more likely to meet criteria for a partial but not full diagnosis of PTSD during their lives (8.6 percent for women compared with 4.5 percent for men). The NCS also found that women ages 15 to 54 were about twice as likely as men in that age range to have PTSD at some point during their lives (the rates were 10.4 percent and 5 percent, respectively; Kessler et al., 1995). Although specific percentages differ, these relative PTSD rates among men and women are in line with findings from other large studies in the United States and some studies from other Western countries (see review by Olff et al., 2007).\n\nIn another analysis of NCS data, Kessler (2000) noted that a larger percentage of women exposed to trauma (20.4 percent) than men exposed to trauma (8.1 percent) had PTSD, but he did not find the difference to be significant. However, women were significantly more likely to have PTSD than men exposed to the same trauma if they had experienced a sexual assault other than rape, a physical attack, a trauma to a loved one, or threat with a weapon. Men, however, had significantly higher PTSD rates connected to combat trauma. Additionally, McLean, Asnaani, Litz, and Hofmann (2011) found a significant difference in both prior-year and lifetime PTSD rates among men and women when they combined data from the NCS-R and two other large national surveys that used the same methodology (National Study of American Life and National Latino and Asian American Study of Mental Health). According to these data, 4.3 percent of women and 1.7 percent of men met criteria for PTSD in the year prior to assessment, and 8.5 percent of women and 3.4 percent of men had the disorder at some point during their lives.\n\nA large trauma study conducted in the Detroit metropolitan area (N=2,181) found that although men were significantly more likely to experience trauma and to have experienced multiple traumas, women were about twice as likely to develop PTSD following a traumatic experience (13 percent of women compared with 6.2 percent of men; Breslau, 2002). However, this study, which evaluated the relative risk for PTSD related to particular types of trauma, also found that this difference could largely be attributed to differences in response to assaultive violence. Although PTSD rates did not differ significantly between men and women exposed to other types of trauma, women were almost six times more likely to develop PTSD in response to assaultive violence than were men (35.7 percent of women and 6 percent of men exposed to such violence developed PTSD).\n\nIn addition to research indicating that women are more likely than men to develop PTSD as a result of assaultive violence, a study conducted with 6,697 male and 554 female veterans from OIF and OEF found that women who sustained physical injury as a result of a traumatic experience were significantly more likely than men who sustained such injuries to develop PTSD (Maguen, Luxton, Skopp, & Madden, 2011). In many studies that evaluate PTSD rates by gender for men and women exposed to the same specific trauma or type of trauma, women are more likely than men to develop PTSD. For example, female 9/11 survivors were significantly more likely than male survivors to have probable PTSD (DiGrande et al., 2010). In a study that compared three different international samples (American, Mexican, and Polish) of individuals who experienced a natural disaster, women in all three samples had significantly more PTSD symptoms (North, Kaniasty, Conrad, Inman, & Murphy, 2002). Also, in a group of 454 college students, women who experienced the death or illness of a loved one had significantly more PTSD symptoms than did men who experienced the same (Gold, Marx, Soler-Baillo, & Sloan, 2005).\n\nAccording to data from the Trauma Recovery Project (n=627), women were also found to be significantly more likely than men to develop prolonged PTSD (lasting for at least 18 months) and had significantly worse ratings of quality of life as a result of prolonged PTSD (Holbrook, Hoyt, Stein, & Sieber, 2002). In addition, studies indicate that women with PTSD, compared with men with the disorder, are more likely to have co-occurring mood disorders but less likely to have co-occurring substance use disorders (McLean & Anderson, 2009; McLean et al., 2011; Olff et al., 2007). Even in the absence of PTSD, trauma exposure is associated with significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower levels of substance abuse among women than among men (Maguen et al., 2011). Using NCS-R data, Dunn, Gilman, Willett, Slopen, and Molnar (2012) found that higher rates of rape and sexual assault among women compared with men were in part responsible for higher depression rates among women.\n\nResearch generally indicates that women are more likely than men to seek treatment for behavioral health disorders (McLean & Anderson, 2009). Therefore, women are also significantly more likely to receive treatment for PTSD. According to NESARC data, women are approximately 34 percent more likely to be treated for PTSD than men (Roberts et al., 2011). Women often respond differently to trauma than do men, which may contribute to higher PTSD rates among women. For example, women are more likely to report dissociation immediately after or in the few weeks following trauma exposure (Cardeña & Carlson, 2011). Women also tend to report more intense emotional responses and more dissociation following trauma exposure (see review by Olff et al., 2007). Research conducted with survivors of serious vehicular accidents indicates that women are significantly more likely than men are to experience certain PTSD symptoms 1 month after the accident (e.g., distress in similar situations, physical reactions to memories, hypervigilance, trouble sleeping, avoidance of thoughts/feelings/activities/places, exaggerated startle response; Fullerton et al., 2001).\n\nPratchett and colleagues (2010) reviewed some of the possible explanations for why women have higher PTSD rates compared with men, even after accounting for trauma exposure. One possibility was that women are more likely to experience types of trauma (e.g., sexual assault) that have a greater propensity to lead to PTSD. Other possibilities are that, in aggregate terms, women’s cognitive appraisals of trauma may differ from those of men and that interpersonal violence, in particular, may be perceived as a greater threat to women’s core identity. In addition, following from research showing significant gender differences in emotional reactivity and/or emotional regulation, women may have more intense emotional responses than men to trauma, which in turn may increase PTSD risk. However, increased emotional reactivity does not necessarily mean that women are more affected by trauma, just that they are affected differently. Research conducted with children who have histories of sexual trauma indicates that boys are more likely to present externalizing symptoms, whereas girls more often present internalizing symptoms. Another possible explanation is that women tend to use different coping strategies following trauma exposure, which may make them more prone to developing PTSD (Olff et al., 2007).\n\nResearch reviewed by Olff and colleagues (2007) also indicates that women who have peritraumatic dissociation at the time of trauma are much more likely than men who have it to develop PTSD; women are also more likely to respond to acute trauma with dissociation and less likely to respond with hyperarousal than are men (Fullerton et al., 2001). Research evaluating physiological differences in male and female responses to trauma tends to confirm that such differences exist. McLean and Anderson (2009) also reviewed possible explanations for higher PTSD rates among women.\n\nWomen may also be affected differently than men by some risk and resilience factors, such as social support. Research conducted with victims (118 male and 39 female) of violent crime found that a negative response from others and a lower level of satisfaction with support from others, had a significantly greater effect on women than on men, although these factors were associated with greater PTSD symptom severity for both men and women (Andrews, Brewin, & Rose, 2003). Similarly, research conducted with military personnel deployed in the Gulf War found that a lack of social support had a greater relationship to depressive symptoms for women than for men, and greater concerns about disruptions in family and personal relationships had a more pronounced connection to anxiety symptoms for women than for men (Vogt, Pless, King, & King, 2005). For military personnel deployed to OIF, negative changes in intimate relationships (according to self-report) following deployment were significantly related to PTSD for women but not men, but only when there was a high level of combat exposure (Skopp et al., 2011).\n\nAnother PTSD risk factor that has been found to have a stronger relationship to PTSD for women than for men includes childhood abuse history (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). Conversely, both antisocial behavior in childhood and younger age at the time of the traumatic event appear to have stronger relationships to PTSD for men than for women (King, King, Foy, & Gudanowski, 1996). In addition, culture appears to play a role in the higher PTSD rates observed in women, and culture can also moderate these differences (Kimerling et al., 2007). Research by Norris, Perilla, Ibanez, and Murphy (2001) that compared PTSD rates for men and women from either the United States or Mexico who were exposed to a natural disaster found that the magnitude of gender differences in PTSD rates were significantly greater for Mexicans than for Americans.\n\nPeople With Lower SES\n\nAlthough it is not possible to say whether lower SES is associated with increased risk for all types of trauma, studies have found that lower SES is linked to significantly greater risk for accidents (Cubbin & Smith, 2002), criminal victimization (Rand & Robinson, 2012; Truman, 2011), combat trauma (Prigerson, Maciejewski, & Rosenheck, 2002), and domestic violence (Mouton et al., 2004; Vest, Catlin, Chen, & Brownson, 2002). Research from around the world, similarly, has found that lower SES is associated with increased risk for accidents (including motor vehicle accidents, burns, and poisoning) and interpersonal violence, including domestic violence (see review by Laflamme, Burrows, & Hasselberg, 2009).\n\nIn a predominately African American sample of 1,256 primary care patients with low SES who were living in an urban center, 46.2 percent met criteria for a PTSD diagnosis at some point during their lives (Gillespie et al., 2009). The most common traumas for men in the study were serious accident or injury (experienced by 56.1 percent), being attacked with a weapon by someone other than an intimate partner (55.1 percent), being attacked without a weapon by someone other than an intimate partner (40.3 percent), a"
