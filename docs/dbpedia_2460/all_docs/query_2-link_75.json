        "text": "All individual candidates or political groups contesting the forthcoming local council elections in Moray are invited to state their case through the pages of our community news site – contact for submissions is editor@insidemoray.news. Today Kenneth Gillespie, Independent candidate for Fochabers/Lhanbryde, has his say.\n\nMY NAME IS KENNETH GILLESPIE and I am delighted to announce that I will be contesting the upcoming Moray Council election as an Independent Candidate in the Fochabers and Lhanbryde ward.\n\nI was brought up, educated and worked in Moray. I am passionate about both the people and communities and I think they need strong representation. It should be the interests and views of the local people first, with party politics second.\n\nI personally have faced the barriers to change in the area and it is now important to think outside the box , to be decisive and to be aware of the financial situation in Moray.\n\nLiving in the ward and during my career as a Financial and Management Consultant, I have gained first-hand experience of life and the issues we face, I feel, are:\n\n1. Education\n\n2. NHS\n\n3. Taxation\n\n4. Transport\n\n5. Broadband\n\n6. Community Safety\n\n7. Economic Development\n\n8. Culture and Equalities\n\n9. Bank Closures\n\n10. Local Authority Budgets\n\nIn addition there are the national issues of Brexit and an Independence Referendum.\n\nWith increasing demands on services, along with reducing budgets, it is my aim to work on your behalf, representing the broad range of views and needs in order to deliver sustainable outcomes.\n\nThe current financial situation of Moray Council has to be addressed, it cannot be sustained in light of budget restraints and overspends. In essence, tough decisions need to be taken and the status quo challenged with the Local Authority being held to account.\n\nI have good knowledge and experience of the political processes and policies, including local, Scottish, Westminster and European governments and I stay updated on current events. I currently do objective and subjective research.\n\nI have proven ability to analyse policies to make continuous improvements and help develop new policies and procedures that meet both local and national objectives.\n\nThere is a need for a different approach and I am of the view that Moray Council needs to work closely with other authorities and public bodies, in order to deliver savings and minimise the effects of changes in service delivery.\n\nIn doing this, especially in the management of public funds, close scrutiny is required. You need to ask the question “Why do we find ourselves in the current situation in Moray?” A starting point in my view would be to examine the culture, competency and accountability within the Council and associated bodies. I would welcome your views.\n\nPlease join me on this journey for a new approach to local politics and for a new strong local voice to represent you and fight for what matters.\n\nI look forward to meeting you and please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss matters – I can also be contacted by Email."
