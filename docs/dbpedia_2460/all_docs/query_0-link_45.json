ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ---------- MONDAY, JANUARY 9, 2006 U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 12 p.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman Specter. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Senate Judiciary Committee will now proceed to the confirmation hearing of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr. for the Supreme Court of the United States. A few matters of administration or housekeeping, and then we will proceed to the opening statements. Today we will hear first from Judge Alito--the introduction of his family. Judge, the floor is yours to introduce your family. Judge Altio. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me introduce my wife, Martha, who is here today; and my sister, Rosemary, who is a lawyer in New Jersey and a tough trial lawyer. I am glad that she took time from her schedule to come to the hearing today. My daughter, Laura, who is a senior at James Caldwell High School in West Caldwell, New Jersey; and if a father can be permitted to brag for a second, a really great swimmer who led her high school team to win the county championship last week. My son, Phillip, who is a second-year student at the University of Virginia. And when I had my confirmation hearing for the Court of Appeals, Phillip was 3 years old. And when I was called up to the chair, he took it upon himself to run up and sit next to me in case any hard questions came up. [Laughter.] Judge Altio. I don't know whether he is going to try the same thing tomorrow, but probably I could use the help. I am glad that my in-laws are able to be here today: my father-in-law, Gene Bomgardner, who is a retired Air Force NCO; and my mother-in-law, Barbara Bomgardner, who is a retired Air Force librarian. And my cousins Andrew and Aldomar Kiriev from Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania, are also here. My mother, who turned 91 a couple of weeks ago, unfortunately is not able to be here today, but I am sure she is watching at home. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Specter. Well, thank you, Judge Alito. You have a beautiful family, and we are delighted to have them with us on the confirmation proceedings. We will have 10-minute rounds of opening statements, each Senator 10 minutes. We will then turn to the presenters, those who will be presenting Judge Alito formally to the Committee. And then we will administer the oath to Judge Alito, and we will hear his testimony. We will begin tomorrow morning at 9:30 for the opening round of questions. Each Senator will have 30 minutes on the opening round, and we have a second round scheduled of 20 minutes for each Senator. And then we will see how we will proceed. Our practice is to adhere to the time limits, and we do that for a number of reasons. One of them is that Senators come and go, and if we maintain the schedule, which is known to everybody, they know when to return for their next round of questions. We will take 15-minute breaks at a convenient time, and, again, we will hold the breaks to 15 minutes. I have worked closely with Senator Leahy on scheduling matters and all other matters, and this is the model that we used for the confirmation of Chief Justice Roberts. It is our intention to conclude the hearings this week, and as Senator Leahy and I worked out, the arrangement is to have a markup on Tuesday, January the 17th, subject to something extraordinary happening. Now let me yield to the distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't want to hold up your opening statement, or the others. I do appreciate people being here. As the hearing for Chief Justice John Roberts showed, there will be real questions asked. I would hope Senators on both sides of the aisle would do that. I think it is important. We are talking about a position representing 295 million Americans. On the schedule, I will work with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, the Chairman. I understand one of our leaders once said that getting Senators to all move in order is like having bullfrogs in a wheelbarrow. But we will continue to work towards that, and I think the most important thing is we have a good, solid hearing this week. Mr. Chairman, you have been totally fair in your procedures for this, as always. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Chairman Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. And now we begin the opening statements. No Senator's vote, except for the declaration of war or the authorization for the use of force, is more important than the confirmation of a nominee to the Supreme Court for a lifetime appointment. Judge Alito comes to this proceeding with extensive experience as a Government lawyer, as a prosecutor, and as a judge. He has written some 361 opinions. He has voted in more than 4,800 cases. And it is possible to select a few of his cases to place him at any and every position on the judicial spectrum. By selecting the right cases, he could look like a flaming liberal or he could look like an arch- conservative. This hearing will give Judge Alito the full opportunity to address the concerns of 280 million Americans on probing questions which will be put to him by 18 Senators representing their diverse constituencies. I have reserved my own vote on this nomination until the hearing is concluded. I am committed as Chairman to a full, fair, and dignified hearing. Hearings for a Supreme Court nominee should not have a political tilt for either Republicans or Democrats. They should be in substance and in perception for all Americans. There is no firmly established rule as to how much a nominee must say to be confirmed. While I personally consider it inappropriate to ask the nominee how he would vote on a specific matter likely to come before the Court, Senators may ask whatever they choose, and the nominee is similarly free to respond as he chooses. It has been my experience that the hearings are really, in effect, a subtle minuet, with the nominee answering as many questions as he thinks necessary in order to be confirmed. Last year, when President Bush had two vacancies to fill, there was concern expressed that there might be an ideological change in the Court. The preliminary indications from Chief Justice Roberts's performance on the Court and his Judiciary Committee testimony on modesty, stability, and not jolting the system all suggest that he will not move the Court in a different direction. If that holds true, Judge Alito, if confirmed, may not be the swing vote regardless of what position Judge Alito takes on the political spectrum. Perhaps the dominant issue in these hearings is the widespread concern about Judge Alito's position on a woman's right to choose. This has arisen in part because of a 1985 statement made by Judge Alito that the Constitution does not provide for the right to an abortion. It has arisen in part because of his advocacy in the Solicitor General's office seeking to limit or overrule Roe and from the dissenting portion of his opinion in Casey v. Planned Parenthood in the Third Circuit. This hearing will give Judge Alito the public forum to address the issue as he has with Senators in private meetings, that his personal views and prior advocacy will not determine his judicial decisions, but instead he will weigh factors such as stare decisis, that is, what are the precedents; that he will weigh women's and men's reliance on Roe and he will consider too whether Roe is ``embedded in the culture of our Nation.'' The history of the Court is full of surprises on the issue. The major case upholding Roe was Casey v. Planned Parenthood, where the landmark opinion was written jointly by three Justices, Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter. Before coming to the Court, Justice Souter, Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor, had all expressed views against a woman's right to choose. David Souter, as Attorney General of New Hampshire, even opposed changing New Hampshire's law prohibiting abortion even after the Supreme Court of the United States had declared it unconstitutional. At the time of Justice Souter's confirmation hearing, there was a stop Souter rally of the National Organization for Women a few blocks from where we currently are holding this hearing, displaying in red a banner ``Stop Souter or Women Will Die,'' ``Stop Souter Rally, a Mass Lobbying Day,'' somewhat similar to this morning's press where banners are paraded in front of the Supreme Court ``Save Roe'' and a brochure circulated again by NOW, ``Save Women's Lives, Vote No on Alito.'' The history of this issue has been one full of surprises. This hearing comes at a time of great national concern about the balance between civil rights and the President's national security authority. The President's constitutional powers as commander in chief to conduct electronic surveillance appear to conflict with what Congress has said in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This conflict involves very major considerations raised by Justice Jackson's historic concurrence in the Youngstown Steel seizure cases, where Justice Jackson wrote, ``When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right, and all that Congress can delegate. When the President acts in absence of a congressional grant of authority, he can rely only upon his own independent powers. When the President takes measures incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.'' And as Justice Jackson noted, ``What is at stake is the equilibrium established in our constitutional system.'' Another major area of concern is congressional power, and in recent decisions the Supreme Court of the United States has declared Acts of Congress unconstitutional, really denigrating the role of Congress. In declaring unconstitutional legislation designed to protect women against violence, the Supreme Court did so notwithstanding a voluminous record in support of that legislation, but because of Congress's ``method of reasoning,'' rather insulting to suggest that there is some superior method of reasoning in the Court. When the Supreme Court handled two cases recently on the Americans with Disabilities Act, they upheld the Act as it applied to discrimination as to access, and declared it unconstitutional as it applied to discrimination in employment. They did so by applying a test of what is called ``congruent and proportionate,'' which candidly stated, no one can figure out. In dissent, Justice Scalia called it a flabby test, where the Court set itself up as the taskmaster to see if Congress had done its homework, and Justice Scalia said that it was an invitation to judicial arbitrariness by policy driven decisionmaking, and this hearing, I know, will involve consideration as to Judge Alito's views on congressional power. There is reason to believe that our Senate confirmation hearings may be having an effect on Supreme Court nominees on their later judicial duties. Years after their hearings, Supreme Court Justices talk to me about our dialogs at these hearings. This process has now evolved to a point where nominees meet most of the Senators. In this process, nominees get an earful. While no promises are extracted, statements are made by nominees which may well influence their judicial decisions. Chief Justice Roberts, for example, will have a tough time giving a jolt to the system after preaching modesty and stability. There is, I think, a heavy sense of drama as these hearings begin. This is the quintessential example of separation of powers under our constitutional process, as the President nominates, the Senate confirms or rejects, and the successful nominee ascends to the bench. While it may be a bit presumptuous, I believe the Framers, if they were here, would be proud and pleased to see how well their Constitution is being applied. My red light just went on, and I now yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy. STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge and Mrs. Alito, and the others. Following up on what the Chairman was saying, the challenge for Judge Alito in the course of these hearings is to demonstrate that he is going to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans, and in doing that, serve as an effective check on Government overreaching. I have said that the President did not help his cause by withdrawing his earlier nomination of Harriet Miers in the face of criticism from a narrow faction of his own party who were concerned about how she might vote. Supreme Court nominations should not be conducted through a series of winks and nods designed to reassure a small faction of our population, while leaving the American people in the dark. And no President, I think we would all agree, should be allowed to pack the courts, and especially the Supreme Court, with nominees selected to enshrine Presidential claims of Government power. The checks and balances that should be provided by the courts, Congress and the Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a narrow partisan agenda. This hearing is the opportunity for the American people to learn what Samuel Alito thinks about their fundamental constitutional rights and whether he--you, Judge--will protect their liberty, their privacy and their autonomy from Government intrusion. The Supreme Court belongs to all Americans, not just to the person occupying the White House, and not just to a narrow faction of either political party, because the Supreme Court is our ultimate check and balance. Independence of the Court and its members is crucial to our democracy and our way of life, and the Senate should never be allowed to be a rubber stamp. Neither should the Supreme Court. So I will ask the Judge to demonstrate his independence from the interests of the President nominating him. This is a nomination to a lifetime seat on the Nation's highest Court. It is a seat that has often represented the decisive vote on constitutional issues, so we have to make an informed decision. That means knowing more about Samuel Alito's work in the Government and knowing more about his views. I will, as the Judge knows, ask about the disturbing application he wrote to become a political appointee in the Meese Justice Department. In that application he professed concern with the fundamental principle of ``one person, one vote,'' a principle of the equality that is the bedrock of our laws. This hearing is the only opportunity that the American people and their representatives have to consider the suitability of the nominee to serve as a final arbiter on the meaning of the Constitution and its laws. Has he demonstrated commitment to the fundamental rights of all Americans? Would he allow the Government to intrude on Americans' personal privacy and freedoms? In a time when this administration seems intent on accumulating unchecked power, Judge Alito's views on Executive power are especially important. It is important to know whether he would serve with judicial independence or as a surrogate for the President nominating him. So this public conversation, this hearing over the next few days is extremely important. It is the people's Constitution and the people's right that we are all charged with protecting and preserving. In this hearing we embark on the constitutional process, one that was designed to protect these rights and has served this country so very well for more than two centuries. I am reminded of a photograph, Mr. Chairman, that hangs in the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. It shows the first women ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States taking the oath of office in 1981. How Justice Sandra Day O'Connor serves is as a model Supreme Court Justice, widely recognized as a jurist with practical values and a sense of the consequences of the legal decisions being made by the Supreme Court. I regret that some on the extreme right have been so critical of Justice O'Connor, and that they adamantly oppose the naming of a successor who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities. Their criticism actually reflects poorly upon them. It does nothing to tarnish the record of the first woman to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She is a Justice whose graciousness and sense of duty fuels her continued service, even agreeing to serve more than 6 months after her retirement date, and I know both you and I commend her for that. The Court that serves America should reflect America. This nomination was an opportunity, of course, for the President to make a nomination based on diversity. He did not, even though there is no dearth of highly qualified Hispanics and African- Americans, other individuals who could well have served as unifying nominees while adding to diversity. But that, of course, is the President's choice, Judge, not yours. But I look forward to a time when the membership of the Supreme Court is more reflective of the country it serves. As the Senate begins its consideration of President Bush's nominee, his third to this seat, to Justice O'Connor's seat, we do so mindful of her critical role in the Supreme Court. Her legacy is one of fairness, and when I decide how to vote it is because I want to see that legacy preserved. Justice O'Connor has been a guardian of the protections the Constitution provides the American people. She has come to provide balance and a check on Government intrusion into our personal privacy and freedoms. In the Hamdi decision she rejected the Bush administration's claim that they could indefinitely detain a United States citizen. She upheld the fundamental principle of judicial review over the exercise of Government power, and she wrote--and this is one we should all remember--she wrote that even war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens. She held that even this President is not above the law, and of course, no President, Democratic or Republican, no President is above the law, as neither are you, nor I, nor anyone in this room. Her judgment has also been critical in protecting our environmental rights. She joined in 5-4 majorities affirming reproductive freedom, and religious freedom, and the Voting Rights Act. I mention each of these cases because they show how important a single Supreme Court Justice is, and it is crucial that we determine what kind of Justice Samuel Alito would be if confirmed. Of course, Judge, my question will be, will you be an independent jurist? It is as the elected representatives of the American people, all of the people, nearly 300 million people, that we in the Senate are charged with the responsibility to examine whether to entrust their precious rights and liberties to this nominee. The Constitution is their document. It guarantees their rights from the heavy hand of Government intrusion, and individual liberties, to freedom of speech, to religion, to equal treatment, to due process and to privacy. Actually, this hearing, this is their process. The Federal Judiciary is unlike the other branches of Government. Once confirmed, a Federal Judge serves for life, and there is no court above the Supreme Court. The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who can demonstrate that he or she will not be beholden to the President, but only to the law. Last October, the President succumbed to partisan pressure from the extreme right of his party by withdrawing Harriet Miers. By withdrawing her nomination and substituting this one, the President has allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme faction within his party before even a hearing or a vote. Frankly, that was an eye-opening experience to me. It gives the impression there are those who do not want an independent Federal Judiciary. They demand judges who will guarantee the results that they want, and that is why the questions will be asked so specifically of you, Judge. The nomination is being considered against the backdrop of another recent revelation, that the President has, outside the law, been conducting secret and warrantless spying on Americans for more than 4 years. This is a time when the protections of America's liberties are directly at risk, as are the checks and balances that serve to constrain abuses of power for more than 200 years. The Supreme Court is relied upon by all of us to protect our fundamental rights. I have not decided how I will vote in this nomination, and like the Chairman, I will base my determination on the whole record at the conclusion of these hearings, just as I did in connection with the nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice. At the conclusion of those hearings I determined to vote for him. The stakes for the American people could not be higher. At this critical moment, Senate Democrats serving on this Committee will perform our constitutional advice and consent responsibility with heightened vigilance. I would urge all Senators, Republicans and Democrats and Independents, to join with us in serious consideration. The appointment of the next Supreme Court Justice must be made in the people's interest and in the Nation's interest, not in the interest of any partisan faction. Mr. Chairman, Thank you very much. Chairman Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome you, Judge Alito, your family members, friends and others who are accompanying you. This hearing is part of an ongoing evaluation of Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is remarkable that after a nearly record-long period without a Supreme Court vacancy, we are here considering a second nominee in less than 6 months. Mr. Chairman, let me first commend you for firmly and fairly handling these hearings. The timetable we are following reflects your efforts to accommodate all sides, and the 70 days since President Bush announced the nomination significantly exceeds the average for other Supreme Court nominees. The debate over this and other judicial nominations is a debate over the judiciary itself. It is a debate over how much power unelected judges should have in our system of government, how much control judges should have over a written Constitution that belongs to the people. Ending up in the right place in this debate requires starting in the right place. The right place to start is the proper description of what judges are supposed to do, and the rest of the process should reflect this judicial job description. The process for evaluating Judge Alito's nomination began when President Bush announced it more than 2 months ago. It continued with Judge Alito's meetings with more than two-thirds of the Senators and a vigorous debate in the media among analysts, scholars, and activists. As the Senate completes the evaluation process, we must keep some very important principles in mind and follow a few basic rules. The first principle is that in this judicial selection process, the Senate and the President have different roles. Under the Constitution, the President, not the Senate, nominates and appoints judges. The Senate has a different role. We must give our advice about whether President Bush should actually appoint Judge Alito by giving or withholding our consent. Abiding by the Constitution's design and our own historical tradition requires that after Judge Alito's nomination reaches the Senate floor, we vigorously debate it and then vote up or down. The second principle is that in our system of Government the judicial and legislative branches have different roles. As Chief Justice Roberts described it when he was before this Committee last fall, ``Judges are not politicians. Judges must decide cases, not champion causes. Judges must settle legal disputes, not pursue agendas. Judges must interpret and apply the law, not make the law.'' This principle that judges are not politicians lies at the very heart of the judicial job description. In addition to these two principles, a few basic rules should guide how we complete this confirmation process. First, we must remember that judicial nominees are constrained in what they may discuss and how they may discuss it. Like Chief Justice Roberts and others before him, Judge Alito is already a Federal judge. He not only will be bound by the canons of judicial ethics as a Supreme Court Justice, he is already bound by these canons as an appeals court judge. Because judges may not issue advisory opinions, judicial nominees may not do so either, especially on issues likely to come before the Court. That rule has always been honored. Needless to say, those who will demand such advisory opinions in this hearing will do so precisely on those issues that are likely to come before the Court. They have a right to ask those questions. But as the Washington Post editorialized just this morning, however, ``he will not--and should not--tell Americans how he will vote on hotly contested issues.'' When Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was before us in 1993, she said that her standard was to give no hints, no forecasts, no previews, and declined to answer dozens of questions. The second rule we should follow is to consider each part of Judge Alito's record on its own terms for what each part actually is. He wrote memos when he worked for the Justice Department. He has written judicial opinions while on the appeals court. He wrote answers to the questionnaire from this Committee in 1990 and again last year. He has written articles and given speeches. He has joined certain groups, and each of these is different. Each of these must be considered in its own context, on its own terms, rather than squeezed, twisted, and distorted into something designed instead to support a preconceived position or serve a preplanned agenda. The third rule we should follow is considering Judge Alito's entire record. Some interest groups focus on--some would say they obsess about--one recusal question, or they cherrypick from the thousands of cases in which Judge Alito participated and the hundreds of opinions he authored or joined. Or they look at the results that ignore the facts and the law in those cases. Judge Alito comes to us with a record that is long, broad, and deep. He deserves, and our constitutional duty requires, that we consider his entire record. Finally, and perhaps most important, we must apply a judicial rather than a political standard to the information before us, and we do have a lot of information. The record includes more than 360 opinions of all kinds--majority, concurring, and dissenting--written during his judicial tenure. We have more than 36,000 pages of additional material, including unpublished opinions, legal briefs, articles, speeches, and Department of Justice documents relating to his service in the Office of Legal Counsel and in the Solicitor General's office. We must apply a judicial, not a political, standard to this record. Asking a judicial nominee whose side you will be on in future cases is a political standard. Evaluating Judge Alito's record by asking those whose side he has been on in past cases is, again, a political standard. Scorecards are common in the political process, but they are inappropriate in the judicial process. The most important tools in the judicial confirmation process are not litmus paper and a calculator. Applying a proper judicial standard to Judge Alito's record means putting aside the scorecards and looking at how he does what judges are supposed to do, namely, settle legal disputes by applying already established law. A judicial standard means that a judicial decision can be entirely correct even when the result does not line up with our preferred political positions or cater to certain political interests. When he was here last fall, Chief Justice Roberts compared judges to umpires who apply rules they did not write and cannot change to the competition before them. We do not evaluate an umpire's performance based on which team won the game, but on how that umpire applied the rules inning after inning. We do not hire umpires by showing them the roster for the upcoming season and demanding to know which teams they will favor before those teams even take the field. Similarly, we should evaluate judges and judicial nominees based on the general process for applying the law to any legal disputes, not on the specific result in a particular case or dispute. The fact that Judge Alito is such a baseball fan gives me even more confidence that he knows the proper role of a judge. I know that there is a pitched battle going on outside the Senate, with dueling press conferences, television ads, e-mail, petition drives, and stacks of reports and press releases. The Senate can rise above that battle if we remember the proper role for the Senate and the proper role for judges. We can rise above that battle if we respect that judicial nominees are limited in what they may discuss. Take each part of Judge Alito's record on its own terms. Consider Judge Alito's entire record and apply a judicial rather than a political standard. Judge Alito, I know you. I have known you for a long time. You are a good man. You are an exceptional judge as well. I welcome you and your family to this Committee, and I hope that the days ahead will reflect more light than heat. We congratulate you that you are willing to go through this grueling process to represent your country on one of the three separated powers. It means so much to all of us, and I am grateful to personally know you as well as I do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy? STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, I join in welcoming you and your family to this Committee. I appreciated the opportunity to visit with you in my office a few weeks ago, and I was particularly impressed by your personal family story of how you were encouraged to do well and contribute to your community. And I also applaud your dedication to public service throughout your lifetime. Supreme Court nominations are an occasion to pause and reflect on the values that make our Nation strong, just, and fair. And we must determine whether a nominee has a demonstrated commitment to those basic values. Will a nominee embrace and uphold the essential meaning of the four words inscribed above the entrance of the Supreme Court Building, ``Equal justice under law.'' Justice Louis Powell spoke for all of us when he said, ``Equal justice under law is perhaps the most inspiring idea of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists.'' As we have seen from Justice O'Connor's example, even one Justice can profoundly alter the meaning of those words for our citizens. Even one Justice can deeply affect the rights and liberties of the American people. Even one Justice can advance or reverse the progress of our journey. So the question before us in these hearings is this: does Judge Alito's record hold true to the letter and the spirit of equal justice? Is he committed to the core values of our Constitution that are at the heart of our Nation's progress, and can he truly be evenhanded and fair in his decisions? In a way Judge Alito has faced this issue before as a nominee to the Court of Appeals. I had the privilege of chairing his confirmation hearing in 1990, and at that time he had practiced law for 14 years, but only represented one client, the U.S. Government. I asked whether he believed he could be impartial in deciding cases involving the Government, and in that hearing Judge Alito said on the record that the most important quality for a judge is open-mindedness to the arguments, and he promised the Committee that he would make a very conscious effort to be absolutely impartial. We took him at his word and overwhelmingly confirmed him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. We now have the record of Judge Alito's 15 years on the bench, and the benefit of some of his earlier writings that were not available 15 years ago, and I regret to say that the record troubles me deeply. In a era where the White House is abusing power, is excusing and authorizing torture and is spying on American citizens, I find Judge Alito's support for an all-powerful executive branch to be genuinely troubling. Under the President's spying program there are no checks and balances. There is no outside review of the legality of this brazen infringement on the civil rights and liberties of the American people. Undeterred by the public outcry, the President vows to continue spying on American citizens. Ultimately the courts will make the final judgment whether the White House has gone too far. Independent and impartial judges must assess the proper balance between protecting our liberties and protecting our national security. I am gravely concerned by Judge Alito's clear record of support for vast Presidential authority unchecked by the other two branches of Government. In decision after decision on the bench, he has excused abusive actions by the authorities that intrude on the personal privacy and freedoms of average Americans, and in his writings and speeches he has supported a level of overreaching Presidential power that, frankly, most Americans find disturbing and even frightening. In fact, it is extraordinary that each of the three individuals this President has nominated for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts, Harriet Miers and now Judge Alito, has served not only as a lawyer for the executive branch, but as a defendant of the most expansive view of Presidential authority. Perhaps that is why this President nominated them. But as Justice O'Connor stated, even a state of war is not a blank check for a President to do whatever he wants. The Supreme Court must serve as an independent check on abuses by the executive branch and a protector of our liberties, not a cheerleader for an imperial presidency. There are other areas of concern. In an era when too many Americans are losing their jobs or working for less, trying to make ends meet, in close cases Judge Alito has ruled the vast majority of the time against the claims of the individual citizens. He has acted instead in favor of Government, large corporations and other powerful interests. In a study by the well-respected expert, Professor Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School, Judge Alito was found to rule against the individual in 84 percent of his dissents. To put it plainly, average Americans have had a hard time getting a fair shake in his courtroom. In an era when America is still too divided by race and riches, Judge Alito has not written one single opinion on the merits in favor of a person of color alleging race discrimination on the job; in 15 years on the bench, not one. When I look at that record in light of the 1985 job application to the Reagan Justice Department, it is even more troubling. That document lays out an ideological agenda that highlights his pride in belonging to an alumni group at Princeton that opposed the admission of women and proposed to curb the admission of racial minorities. It proclaims his legal opinion that the Constitution does not protect the right of women to make their own reproductive decisions. It expresses outright hostility to the basic principle of one person, one vote, affirmed by the Supreme Court as essential to ensuring that all Americans have a voice in their Government. This application was not a youthful indiscretion. It was a document prepared by a mature, 35-year-old professional. Finally, many of us are concerned about conflicting statements that Judge Alito has made in response to questions from this Committee and others. As Chairman Specter has stated, this confirmation largely depends on the credibility of Judge Alito's statements to us, and we have questions. When asked about the ideological statements and specific legal opinions in his 1985 application, Judge Alito has dismissed those statements as just applying for a job. When he was before this Committee in 1990 applying for a job to the circuit, he promised under oath that he would recuse himself from cases involving Vanguard, the mutual fund company in which he had most of his investments. But as a judge he participated in a Vanguard case anyway, and has offered many conflicting reasons to explain why he broke his word. We need to get to the bottom of this matter to assure ourselves that what Judge Alito says in these hearings will not be just words, but pledges that guide him in the future if he is confirmed. Judges are appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and it is our duty to ask questions on great issues that matter to the American people and to speak for them. Many Republican Senators certainly demanded answers from Harriet Miers. We should expect no less from Judge Alito. There is not time for a double standard. If confirmed, Judge Alito could serve on the Court for a generation or more, and the decisions he will make as Justice will have a direct impact on the lives and liberties of our children, our grandchildren and even our great-grandchildren. We have only one chance to get it right, and a solemn obligation to do so. Judge Alito, I have serious questions to ask. I congratulate you on your nomination, and I look forward to your answers in these hearings. Chairman Specter. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Grassley. STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. I have a much more positive view of Judge Alito. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. I think the record will sustain my view. But first, Judge Alito, I welcome you and your proud family to the Committee, and congratulations on your nomination. I first want to remind all Americans who might be listening that the Senate has a very important responsibility to confirm only well-qualified individuals who will faithfully interpret the law and the Constitution. Confirmation should be limited to those individuals who will be fair, unbiased, devoted to addressing the facts in the law before them without imposing their own values and political beliefs when deciding cases. Nominees should not be expected to precommit to ruling on certain issues in a certain way, nor should Senators ask nominees to pledge to rule on cases in a particular way. If we fulfill our responsibility to the Constitution, the Supreme Court will be filled with superior legal minds who will pursue the one agenda that our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution, justice rather than political or personal goals. The Supreme Court will then consists of individuals who meticulously apply the law and the Constitution regardless of whether the results they reach are popular or not. If we do our job right, the Supreme Court will not be made up of men and women who are on the side of the little guy or the big guy, rather the Supreme Court will be made up of men and women who are on the side of the law and the Constitution. From all accounts, Judge Alito has an impressive and extensive legal and judicial record, certainly one worthy of someone on the Supreme Court. Judge Alito excelled at top-notch schools, member of law review, clerked for a Federal judge. He also held important positions at the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, the Solicitor General's Office and was U.S. Attorney for New Jersey before being appointed to the Third Circuit. I want to remind the American people this nominee, Judge Alito, has been confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate, not once, but twice. This is a tremendous record of accomplishment in public service equal to any Supreme Court nominee that I have considered in the 25 years I have been on this Committee. Not only that, Judge Alito has a reputation for being an exceptional and honest judge devoted to the rule of law, as well as being a man of integrity. Judge Alito enjoys the support and respect of people who work with him, practice with him, and therefore, know him best. Example, 54 of Judge Alito's law clerks, Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, signed a letter to the Committee that stated, ``We collectively were involved in thousands of cases and it never once appeared to us that Judge Alito has prejudged a case or ruled based on political ideology.'' Continuing to quote, ``It is our uniform experience that Judge Alito was guided by his profound respect for the Constitution and the limited role of the judicial branch.'' Those 54 opinions say a lot about Judge Alito and his approach to judicial function. Like Chief Justice Roberts, it appears that Judge Alito tries to act like an umpire, calling the balls and strikes, rather than advocating a particular outcome. I am also impressed with the very complimentary things that some lawyers have had to say about Judge Alito in the Lawyers Evaluation Section of the Almanac of Federal Judiciary. With respect to his legal ability, lawyers praised him, saying that Judge Alito was ``exceptional,'' ``a brilliant jurist.'' Another lawyer stated that, ``to say that he is outstanding is to use understatement. He's the best judge on the circuit, maybe in the country.'' With respect to his demeanor and temperament, lawyers found Judge Alito to be measured and judicial while on the bench. One lawyer commented that he is demanding, but always courteous. He may occasionally, quoting, ``demonstrate a little bit of impatience with lawyers that aren't quite getting it. This can be directed at either side. It's just a sign that his mind is working more efficiently than yours. He's never discourteous, never abusive.'' Another lawyer said, ``He is pleasant and courteous.'' Others commented about the impression that Judge Alito is a conservative judge, but certainly not out to impose his own personal agenda while on the bench. One lawyer commented that he ``is a conservative, but reaches honest decisions,'' while another said, ``By reputation he's known to be one of the more conservative judges on the court, but he is forthright and fair. He tries to decide cases in front of him in the right way.'' The American Bar Association came out just last week with an evaluation of Judge Alito to be a Justice, and they considered things like integrity, judgment, compassion, open- mindedness and freedom from bias and commitment to equal justice under the law. The ABA once again found Judge Alito to be unanimously well qualified. This recommendation should have much weight for my colleagues on the other side, who have time and time again described the rating of the ABA as, quote, ``gold standard.'' Yet, some liberal interest groups have come out in full force and have attempted to paint Judge Alito to be an extremist and to be an activist. They have criticized a nominee who has, from what I see described by these lawyers and fellow judges, a reputation of being a restrained jurist committed to the rule of law and the Constitution, but that is what these outside-the-mainstream groups always do. They attack individuals who they believe will not implement their agenda before the Supreme Court, so Judge Alito should see criticism as a badge of honor worn by many past and present members of the Court. Yet, I am glad to see the public fully participate in this process because this is the nature of our system of Government, but I do not like to see facts twisted, untruths fabricated to give the nominee a black eye even before he comes before our Committee. So, Judge Alito, now you have that opportunity to set everyone straight on your record and your approach to deciding cases. These hearings are also an opportunity, a very good opportunity to remind the public about the proper role of a judge in our system of checks and balances limited Government. Judges are required by our democratic system not to overstep their positions to become policymakers or super legislators. Supreme Court nominees should know, without any doubt, that their job is not to impose their own personal opinions of what is right and wrong, but to say what the law is, rather than what they personally think the law ought to be. Supreme Court nominees should know that this exercise of judicial restraint is a key ingredient of being a good judge, as the Constitution constrains judges every bit as it constrains we legislators, executives and citizens in their actions. Moreover, Supreme Court nominees should be individuals who not only understand but truly respect the equal roles and responsibilities of different branches of Government and our State Governments. As Alexander Hamilton said in Federalist No. 78, ``The courts must decide the sense of the law, and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequences would be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.'' Our Framers expected the judicial branch to be the least dangerous branch of Government. At our meeting in my office in November, I heard Judge Alito place emphasis on the limited role of the courts in our democratic society. He also reiterated this belief in a questionnaire he submitted to this Committee. So I have some idea of how Judge Alito approaches the law and views the role of a judge. I am hopeful that his commitment to judicial restraint and to confining decisions to the law and the Constitution will shine through in this hearing, and I believe it will, and I am hopeful that my colleagues will give Judge Alito a civil, a fair and a dignified process, as well as an up or down vote, because as always, the Constitution sets the standard: the President nominates, the Senate deliberates, and then we are obligated to give our advice and consent in an up or down vote. Judge Alito, I congratulate you. Chairman Specter. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley. Senator Biden. STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE Senator Biden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, welcome. Mrs. Alito and your family, welcome. It is an incredible honor to be nominated by a President of the United States to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and you are to be congratulated. Judge, this may be one of the most significant, consequential nominations that the Senate will vote on since I have been here in the last three decades. I think history has delivered you, fortunately or unfortunately, to a moment where Supreme Court historians far into the future are going to look back on this nomination and make a judgment whether or not with your nomination, and if you are confirmed, whether the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court begin to change from the consensus that existed the last 70 years, or whether it continued on the same path it has over the past six or seven decades, and that moment is right now. Lest we think it is kind of like we all go through this process--and I like the phrase ``minuet'' that the Chairman used--we all act like there is not an elephant in the room. The truth of the matter is, there is significant debate among judicial scholars today as to whether or not we have gone off on the wrong path with regard to Supreme Court decisions. There is a very significant dispute that has existed in 5-4 decisions over the past two decades in a Court that is very closely divided on the critical, central issues of the day. Just to make it clear, I am puzzled by some of the things you have said, and I am sure you are going to get a chance to tell me what you meant by some of the things you wrote and said, but when in your job application you talked about being proud, as you should be, to be proud of your subscription to and adhering to notions put forward in the National Review that you are a proud member of the Federalist Society, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, the American Spectator is something you look to, et cetera. These are all really very bright folks. They all have a very decided opinion on the issues of the day--very decided. And those very organizations I have named think, for example, we misread the Fifth Amendment and have been misreading it for the past three decades. Those same groups argue that, in fact, there is no right of privacy in the Constitution, et cetera. So people are not making this up. In a sense, it is not about you. You find yourself in the middle of one of the most significant national debates in modern constitutional history because you have been nominated to replace a woman, in addition, who has been the deciding vote on a significant number of these cases. Since 1995 there have been 193 5-4 decisions, and Justice O'Connor 77 percent of the time has been the deciding vote. And for 70 years, there has been a consensus among scholars and the American people on a reading of the Constitution that protects the right of privacy, the autonomy of individuals, while at the same time empowering the Federal Government to protect the less powerful. Only recently has the debate come that States rights are being trumped in a fundamental way, a reading of the 10th Amendment and 11th Amendment. That is a legitimate debate. Totally legitimate. But anybody who pretends that how you read the 10th and 11th Amendment does not have a fundamental impact on the things we care about is kidding themselves. They are either uninformed or they are kidding themselves. So, Judge, there is a genuine struggle going on well beyond you, well beyond the Congress, in America about how to read the Constitution. And I believe at its core we have a Constitution, as our Supreme Court's first great Justice Marshall said in 1819, and I quote, ``intended to endure for the ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'' That is the crux of the debate we are having now, whether it is an adaptable Constitution. A lot of my friends make very powerful and convincing arguments--and they may be right--that, no, no, no, no, no, it is not adaptable, it is not adaptable. And since our country's founding, we have tried to keep Government's heavy hand out of our personal lives while ensuring that we do the most important thing, which is to protect those who cannot protect themselves. And the debate raging today is about whether we will continue along that path and whether our courts will continue to be one of the places where society puts the little guy--and I know this is not something you are supposed to say--the little guy on the same footing with the big guy. The one place David is equal to Goliath is in the Supreme Court. It is also important to note that you are slated to replace the first woman ever nominated to the Supreme Court. We can pretend that is not the fact, but it is. And through no fault of your own, we are cutting the number of women in half on the Court. And now, as I said, that is not your fault, but I think it means that we have to take, at least speaking for myself, a closer look at your stands on issues that are important to women. And, moreover, Justice O'Connor brought critical qualities to the High Court that not everybody thinks are qualities--I happen to think they are--her pragmatism and her statecraft. Not that I have always agreed with what she said, far from it, but Justice O'Connor has been properly lauded in my view as a judge who approached her duties with open- mindedness and with a sensitivity to the effects her decisions would have on everyday, ordinary people. She, unlike Judge Bork, did not think that being on the Court would be ``an intellectual feast,'' to quote Judge Bork. Justice O'Connor also brought balance to our highest Court. Most recently, as has been repeated many times, she cautioned about war does not give a blank check. Her decisions reflect, in my view, that our societies work very hard to improve the workaday world, to open doors to workers confronted by powerful employers and for women facing harassment and stereotypes. Now, I acknowledge this is a very tough job a judge has in determining whether or not there is an openness that is required under the Constitution. But I also acknowledge that prejudice runs very deep in our society, and in the real world, discrimination rears its ugly head in the shadows where it is very difficult to root it out. But Justice O'Connor was not afraid to go into the shadows. The Constitution provides for one democratic moment, Judge, before a lifetime of judicial independence when the people of the United States are entitled to know as much as we can about the person that we are about to entrust with safeguarding our future and the future of our kids. And, Judge, simply put, that is this moment, the one democratic moment in a lifetime of absolute judicial independence. And that is what these hearings are about, in my view. In the coming days, we want to know about what you believe, Judge, how you view the Constitution, how you envision the role of the Federal courts, what kind of Justice you would seek to become. As I said, this one democratic moment when the people, through their elected representatives, get to ask questions of a President's choice for the highest Court. And I hope you will be forthcoming. I cannot imagine, notwithstanding what many of my colleagues, whom I have great respect for, believe, I can't imagine the Founders, when they sat down and wrote the document and got to the Appointments Clause and said, You know what? The American people are entitled to know before we make him President, before we make her Senator, before we make him Congressman, what they believe on the major issues of the day. But judges, Supreme Court nominees, as long as they are smart and honest and decent, it really does not matter what they think. We do not have to know. I can't fathom--can't fathom-- that that was the intent of the Founders. They intended the American people to know what their nominees thought. And I might add--and I will end with this--we just had two Supreme Court Justices before our caucus just as they were before, I think, the Republican Caucus. They ventured opinions on everything. On everything, things that are going to come before the Court. It did not in any way jeopardize their judicial independence. So, Judge, I really hope that this does not turn out to be a minuet. I hope it turns out to be a conversation. I believe we--you and I and this Committee--owe it to the American people in this one democratic moment to have a conversation about the issues that will affect their lives profoundly. They are entitled to know what you think. And I remind my colleagues, many of whom are on this Committee, they sure wanted to know what Harriet Miers thought about everything. They sure wanted to know in great detail. They were about ready to administer blood tests. The good news is no blood test here. The good news is no blood test, just a conversation, and I hope you will engage in it with us because I am anxious to get a sense of how you are going to approach these big issues. I thank you very much, Judge. Chairman Specter. Thank you, Senator Biden. Senator Kyl? STATEMENT OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Senator Kyl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Judge Alito, to your confirmation hearing. At the outset, I am pleased to note that you have more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. Indeed, only one Supreme Court Justice in history, one Horace Lurton, nominated by President Taft, had more Federal appeals court experience. Moreover, you have devoted virtually your entire professional life to public service, and the Nation owes you gratitude for that service. I look forward to a dignified hearing followed by a fair up or down vote on the Senate floor. Before discussing your nomination, I would like to take a moment to express my respect and admiration for the Justice whom you are nominated to replace, my fellow Arizonan Sandra Day O'Connor, whom I have known for more than 30 years. Justice O'Connor has served with great distinction during her career in the Arizona Legislature, on the Arizona Court of Appeals, and for what has been a quarter of a century on the U.S. Supreme Court. Arizonans are deeply proud of Justice O'Connor's service to this country. She will always be remembered by Arizonans and all Americans as an extraordinary public servant. Judge Alito, I would like to discuss your background and experience in the context of other Justices on the Supreme Court so that everyone understands how well you satisfy what we have come to expect from our top judges. Like all the sitting Justices, you had an outstanding education. One of your classmates at Yale Law School, Tony Kronman, who later went on to be the dean of the law school and could, I believe, fairly be described as a political liberal, has recently remarked, and I quote, ``He impressed me''--speaking of you--``as being more interested in the technical, intellectual challenges of the law and its legal reasoning than its political uses or ramifications.'' Thus, even in your early 20's, it appears you were focused on the law as an independent pursuit rather than using law to influence political ends. With your intellect and education, you could have become a wealthy attorney, but instead you devoted virtually all of your legal career to the public service. In doing so, you meet, and even exceed, the stellar examples set by Justices Thomas and Souter, each of whom devoted most of their pre-judicial careers to public service. Perhaps this is because, like Justices Ginsburg and Scalia, you had a father who was an immigrant to this Nation. It seems that immigrants often have a special understanding of the incredible opportunities that this Nation affords its citizens. Moreover, your father's long service to the people of New Jersey both as a schoolteacher and as a civil servant in the State legislature plainly served as a model for you. I also note that you served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1972 until 1980. If confirmed, only you and Justice Stevens would have any military experience. You would also be the first Supreme Court Justice to have served in the Army Reserves since Justice Frank Murphy did so during World War II. You have spent much of your career as a Federal prosecutor pursuing terrorists, mob kingpins, drug dealers, and others who threaten our safety and our security. Justice Souter had a distinguished career as a State prosecutor, but no sitting Justice has served as a Federal prosecutor. Again, this experience could prove helpful given that approximately 40 percent of the Supreme Court docket involves criminal matters. You also served as an attorney in the executive branch. Like Chief Justice Roberts, you served in the Solicitor General's office representing our Government before the Supreme Court. And like Justice Scalia, you served in the Office of Legal Counsel, providing constitutional advice to the President and the rest of the executive branch. In both of these roles, your job was to advance the policies of a President who twice won an electoral college landslide. He set the agenda, and you helped him implement it. Similarly, Justice Thomas served Presidents Reagan and Bush in political/legal capacities, and Justice Breyer also worked in political jobs, both in President Johnson's Justice Department and as a lawyer to this Committee. I note that you were just 39 when nominated to serve on the Third Circuit. Justice Kennedy was only 38 when nominated to the Ninth Circuit, and Justice Breyer only 42 when nominated to the First Circuit. Like them, you now have a great deal of hands-on experience that you can bring to the Court for years to come. During your judicial service, you amassed an impressive record for the Senate to review, including more than 350 authored opinions. It is this judicial record that should be the focus of this Committee, just as it was with all of the other sitting Justices on the Court. It appears to me that you easily fit into the mold of what this Nation has come to expect from a Supreme Court Justice: a first-rate intellect, demonstrated academic excellence, a life of engagement with serious constitutional analysis, and a reputation for fair- mindedness and modesty. These are the standards for a Supreme Court Justice, and you plainly meet these expectations. As a consequence, I view your nomination with a heavy presumption in favor of confirmation. Before I conclude, I would like, though, to address two other points. First, some of my colleagues are fond of asking the question, Which side are you on? You have heard that today. Politicians must pick sides regularly, every time they vote, so it is perhaps natural that they see the world as a battle between competing groups. But it is wholly inappropriate as an approach to the judicial role. The only relevant side is that of the law and the Constitution. We do great injury to the integrity of the court system when we start speaking of sides and stop devoting ourselves to the pursuit of impartial justice. During Chief Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings, I was struck by the way he answered the question. Then Judge Roberts explained that he had been asked earlier in the confirmation process, Are you going to be on the side of the little guy? Roberts explained that this question troubled him, and this is how he answered. He said, ``If the Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little guy is going to win. But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then the big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the Constitution. That's the oath. The oath that a judge takes is not that I will look out for particular interests. The oath is to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States.'' And this is the essence of justice. Our courts provide a neutral forum for the adjudication of disputes under the law, not based on economic or political power, on race, on sex, or any other personal characteristics. Big guy, little guy--it should make no difference. The rule of law demands neutrality. Second, I want to address the proper scope of questioning during these hearings, a matter that has also come up already. As I reminded Chief Justice Roberts at his hearings, the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct dictates that, and I quote, ``a judge or candidate for election or appointment to judicial office shall not, with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office.'' In other words, no judicial nominee should answer any question that is designed to reveal how the nominee will rule on any issue that could come before the Court. This rule has come to be known as ``the Ginsburg standard'' because Justice Ginsburg stated during her own confirmation hearings that she would give no forecasts, no hints about how she would rule on issues. And I was pleased to see that Chief Justice Roberts refused to prejudge issues or make promises in exchange for confirmation votes. We are all better off because of his principled stand. Soon after his confirmation, Justice Ginsburg was asked about this Ginsburg standard as applied to the Roberts hearings, and she said, ``Judge Roberts was unquestionably right. My rule was I will not answer a question that attempts to project how I will rule in a case that might come before the Court.'' In other words, Justice Ginsburg reaffirmed the Ginsburg standard. In light of the Chief Justice's confirmation hearings and Justice Ginsburg's later remarks, I asked my colleagues for basic fair play. Apply the same standards to Judge Alito that we applied to John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and all of the other sitting Justices. Let's not invent a new standard for Judge Alito or change the rules in the middle of the game. Politicians must let voters know what they think about issues before the election. Judges should not. And it is not a hypothetical matter. Senator Kennedy in his opening statement expressed concern about the extent of the executive branch's authority to conduct surveillance of terrorists and said ultimately the courts will decide whether the President has gone too far. Indeed they will. Judge Alito, I will tell you the same thing I told John Roberts. I expect you to adhere to the Code of Judicial Conduct, and I want you to know that I will strongly defend your refusal to give any indication of how you might rule on any matter that might come before you as a judge or to answer any question that you believe to be improper under the circumstances. Congratulations, Judge Alito, on your nomination. Chairman Specter. Thank you, Senator Kyl. Senator Kohl? STATEMENT OF HON. HERBERT KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Senator Kohl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, let me also send my welcome to you this afternoon and to your family. You are to be congratulated on your nomination. Through its interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court hugely shapes the fabric of our society for us and for future generations. Over the course of more than 200 years, it has found a right to equal education regardless of race. It has guaranteed an attorney and a fair trial to all Americans, rich and poor alike. It has allowed women to keep private medical decisions private. And it has allowed Americans to speak, vote, and worship without interference from their Government. Through these decisions and many more, the judicial branch has in its finest hours stood firmly on the side of individuals against those who would trample their rights. In the words of Justice Black, ``The courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice or public excitement.'' As the guardian of our rights, the Supreme Court makes decisions every year which either protect the individual or leave him at the mercy of more powerful forces in our society. They consider questions like when can a disabled individual sue to gain access to a courthouse, when can a parent leave work to care for a sick child, when should the Government be allowed to listen to a private conversation, and when will the courthouse doors open or close to an employee suffering discrimination at work. Whether interpreting the Constitution or filling in the blanks of a law or a regulation, every word of the Court's opinion can widen or narrow our rights as Americans and either protect us or leave us more vulnerable to any winds that blow. If confirmed, you will write the words that will either broaden or narrow our rights for the rest of your working life. You will be interpreting the Constitution in which we as a people place our faith and on which our freedoms as a Nation rest. And on a daily basis, the words of your opinions will affect countless individuals as they seek protection behind the courthouse doors. Despite your enormous power, you will be free of all constraints, unaccountable and unrecallable. We give Supreme Court Justices this freedom because we expect them to remain above the pull of politics, to avoid the effects of public excitement and allow a broader view, not tied to the whims of the majority at a certain moment in the history. So for only a short time this month will the people through their Senators be able to question and to judge you. In short, before we give you the keys to the car, we would like to know where you plan to take us. To a certain extent, we know more about what is in your heart and in your mind than we did with now Justice Roberts. You have a long track record as a judge and as a public official in the Justice Department. When we met privately and I asked you what sort of Supreme Court Justice you would make, your answer was fair when you said, ``If you want to know what sort of a Justice I would make, then look at what sort of a judge I have been.'' Taking this advice, your critics argue that your judicial record demonstrates that you will not sufficiently protect the individual, but will instead side with more powerful interests, narrow the rights we enjoy, and leave individual Americans more vulnerable to abuse. For example, they cite your Casey dissent as diminishing the power of married women over their own bodies. They identify your decision in the Chittister case as evidence that you will make it harder for working people to care for a family. They cite the Bray case and others where you often side with corporations to block the victims of discrimination from getting their day in court. Others raise concerns about your views on the rights of the accused when faced with the Government's enormous power in the criminal justice process. In addition to your record on the bench, your opponents identify memos you wrote while in the Justice Department as further evidence of your hostility to individual rights. For example, in your now famous 1985 job application, you expressed pride in some of the work you did in the Solicitor General's office. You chose to single out the assistance that you provided in crafting Supreme Court briefs urging that ``the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.'' While these statements came in the context of your work on behalf of the Reagan administration, they were, nevertheless, your self- proclaimed personal views. In the same job application, you wrote that you had pursued a legal career because you disagreed with many of the decisions of the Warren Court, especially, and I quote, ``in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.'' These Warren Court decisions establishing one person/one vote, Miranda "
