        "text": "Most people old enough to remember the late 1980s, or before, recall that all social change movements used to have participatory music that was common to those who were active in that effort, as well as to others who were not active, but were supportive. Sometime around the early nineties, use of this tool diminished and – in many instances – vanished, at least in the U.S.\n\nLots of social change songs are still being written and hip-hop has become the voice of many social change activists, but hardly any of these songs involve the audience as participants.\n\nPeter Bergel is a lifelong social change activist and song leader\n\n[Mr. Bergel has graciously allowed us to link the lyrics of the songs in his program to this entry.]\n\nStilleven: Contemporary Still Life\n\nStilleven (the Dutch word for still life) features work by 27 contemporary artists from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia who focus on still life in their artwork. Organized by Director John Olbrantz and Collection Curator Jonathan Bucci, the exhibition includes paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, photographs, glass, and mixed media by artists Katherine Ace, Holly Andres, David Giese, Norman Lundin, Flora Mace and Joey Kirkpatrick, Henk Pander, and Sherrie Wolf, among many others. ICL tour to be led by Jonathan Bucci.\n\nNorthwest Perspectives: Selections from the Permanent Collection\n\nOn permanent view - Carl Hall Gallery\n\nVisitors can explore new ideas of landscape, narrative, identity, form and process through a variety of paintings, sculptures and mixed media that highlight both visual and conceptual relationships between historic and contemporary art.\n\nThe gallery provides the museum with an opportunity to share many previously unviewed works that capture the rich and varied expressions that have taken place during the past century, which has been marked by rapid changes in the art world, the Northwest and its landscape.\n\nThis gallery is named for Carl Hall (1922-1996), who taught at Willamette University for nearly 40 years and painted a luminous record of his response to the region. ICL tour led by Elizabeth Garrison, Cameron Paulin Curator of Education.\n\nTerry Horne will talk on the newspaper industry and how it has changed and will continue to do so.\n\nTerry Horne was appointed president and publisher of the Statesman Journal and StatesmanJournal.com and Statesman Journal Media on Sept. 18, 2014.

She lives in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.\n\nWho am I and where do I belong? These questions are foundational to our identity as individuals and to our formation of community. This colloquium explores the experiences of people of Asian heritage (broadly defined) who have called Oregon home and examines Asian influences on the land and culture of the state. We will closely examine the connections we make between place and identity by considering the Japanese American community in Hood River, OR; the Chinatowns of Portland, OR; and the Kam Wah Chung State Heritage Site in John Day, OR. We will engage a broad range of material, including memoirs (Big Little Man by Alex Tizon) and urban history (Sweet Cakes, Long Journey by Marie Rose Wong), but will focus in particular on first-hand sources and experiential learning, combining work in local archives with field trips to obtain a better sense of the ways in which Oregon reflects Asian heritage.\n\nCecily McCaffrey is the Willamette University Associate Professor of History.\n\nDespite having a reputation as the“land of the free,” the United States currently incarcerates about 2.4 million men, women and children. Snapshot statistics like this one, however, do not capture the churn in jails, prisons and detention centers; nearly 12 million people cycle through local jails every year alone. The 2.4 million number also does not take into account how many people’s lives are affected by our extensive system of punishment, including those on parole or probation; children of incarcerated parents; and communities that support prison systems. Furthermore, racial disparities in arrests, sentencing, and prison time call into question our guarantees of equal justice and fundamental fairness. This colloquium explores three critical questions about the American punishment system: Why is the prison population so high? What are the consequences of such a vast system of control? What reforms, if any, should we pursue?\n\nAssociate Professor of Politics\n\nCourses Taught:\n\nPolitics 210 - American Politics\n\nPolitics 330 - Topics in Public Policy\n\nPolitics 351W - Women in American Politics\n\nJenny Barischoff has worked with refugees for seven years and with Catholic Charities for the last three years.

She currently services as the Director of Refugee Resettlement at Catholic Charities.\n\nOregon and the Pacific Northwest already lead the nation in reliance on renewable energy. To the hydroelectricity from our rivers we’re adding wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and ocean energy technologies. Energy efficiency has been a passion in Oregon since the energy crises of the 1970s. Our cities have become world showcases demonstrating how urban areas thrive when transit, bicycles and pedestrians share transportation duties with the automobile. We know how to do this. We're doing it: creating green jobs and businesses, improving livability, adding to local tax receipts, and developing new products and services to sell to those in the slow lane. We also care about the health of our streams and forests, and about the world we will leave to our children and grandchildren. We can contain greenhouse gas emissions, manage the impacts before they reach widely destructive levels,and create new opportunities for economic growth– but we must act now.\n\nOregon has committed to arresting the growth of greenhouse gas emissions in the near future, and then joining a global effort to reduce them to safe levels by 2050. But each day’s delay means steeper reductions when we get around to making them. The good news is that Oregon’s efforts are already showing results: we’re on target to meet our goals, but we need to step up our efforts to reach our 2020 and 2050 goals.\n\nAngus Duncan is the founding President of the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, which supports renewable energy development and watershed restoration in the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Duncan has worked in private sector renewable energy project development, in state and local government, as a Member and Chair of the Northwest Power Planning Council, and as Director of Energy Policy, US Department of Transportation.\n\nIn 2004 Mr. Duncan chaired the Drafting Committee that wrote Oregon’s climate change goals and strategy, since adopted by the Governor and Legislature. In 2008, he was appointed by Governor Kulongoski as Chair of Oregon’s new Global Warming Commission; and in 2009, to the Governor’s Energy Policy Council. Mr. Duncan has consulted with NRDC since 2007 on utility energy and climate policies in the Pacific Northwest states; and with The Bullitt Foundation on transportation energy and greenhouse gas issues.\n\nPeople think of Poe as a pale, lurking man with a moustache who wrote a poem about a scary bird that they read in high school. My audience's expectation is to be entertained in a seasonally appropriate fashion. With this in mind, I play up the creepy elements in Poe's stories and poems. Of course I always close with \"The Raven\".\n\nAn Oregon native and former Bend resident, Jaques has been a professional and Shakespearean actor for more than a decade and an unrepentant bardolater (Shakespeare nut) since the age of five. In addition to his numerous theater credits, he is a frequent commercial voice-over talent and audio narrator.

Her goal is to travel around the world and experience life after college\n\nAll the books written about Lewis and Clark were from a white man’s perspective. Learn about the Native People’s view of Lewis and Clark. How did the Columbia River matriarchal society see Lewis and Clark? What did they think of the smelly bearded men who ignored the sacred salmon in preference for dog meat?\n\nAbout the Artist:\n\nPat Courtney Gold is a Native American fiber artist and basket weaver. She is a Wasco Native of the ancestral “Long Narrows Wasco” the upriver branch of the Chinook Nation. Her ancestors lived along the Columbia River for more than 12,000 years. She was born and raised on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, Oregon.\n\nPat obtained a B.A. in mathematics and physics from Whitman College and worked in the field until 1991 when she decided instead to focus on art especially reviving the weaving of her Wasco ancestors. Today Pat Courtney Gold is recognized internationally as an exquisite weaver who does both traditional weaving, that incorporate designs that express the cultural life of her people, as well as creating contemporary pieces. Besides doing artwork, she teaches, consults, and lectures about the Columbia River Native cultures to universities and museums. Her art is shown in museums and collections around the world.\n\nOregon’s largest ghost town was once Oregon’s second largest city. For a short time in the 1940’s, over 40,000 people resided at Camp Adair, located just north of Corvallis Oregon. Four U.S. Army Divisions were trained there and saw action in both the European and Pacific theaters. This presentation will attempt to bring WWII a little closer to home, both geographically and emotionally, through the use of personal accounts and letters. We will follow the 70th Infantry Division through training at Camp Adair, arrival in Europe, and immediate engagement with the German Army in France and Germany beginning in January 1945. The sacrifices and contributions of these men were exceptional as well as typical, as they joined millions of others to end the Nazi scourge and bring World War II to a close."
