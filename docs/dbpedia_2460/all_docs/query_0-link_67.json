The creation of a representative and legitimate defence force is probably the most difficult aspect of our commitment to create a common society and to build institutions which unite rather than divide us. The role of the new defence force is to protect and consolidate democracy: this implies a total break from the past when the South African Defence Force helped to make South Africa a ‘terrorist state’ reliant on fear to maintain its authority. In the past vast resources were devoted to the SADF to support white minority rule. Today military expenditure must be appropriate to our central task: to address the real threats to our security – poverty and unemployment. In the past military issues were also shrouded in secrecy, whereas today we are committed to transparency.\n\nIn this context there is an urgent need for extensive public debate on defence and security issues. We need to empower civil society through access to information and alternative perspectives so that debate is not dominated by ‘insider’ security experts, and to enable a broader range of our people to contribute and make their voices heard. Both the consultation around the 1996 Defence White Paper and the Defence Review process have allowed for some participation from civil society, but that participation must be widened and deepened. In particular, efforts must be made to ensure that women participate because they suffer the most from poverty, unemployment and environmental degradation. As a contribution to the public debate on defence and security issues, the publication of this book is to be welcomed.\n\nThenjiwe Mtintso\n\nChair, Commission on Gender Equality\n\nPretoria\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis book draws on research which was conducted for the Group for Environmental Monitoring (GEM) between 1993 and 1997.

The consolidation of this democracy depends on the capacity of the post-apartheid state to meet human needs. This book presents an argument for shifting resources from the military towards this goal.\n\nThroughout Africa, the military has been a major obstacle to achieving democracy, and war has been instrumental in the continent’s development crisis. It has meant death and injury for millions, absorbed vast amounts of national resources, caused ecological damage, destroyed infrastructure and social organisation, distorted production, and created millions of displaced people and refugees. Even when there has been victory in liberation struggles against colonial rule, or cease-fires after civil wars, real peace has often been short-lived and democratic government has not been realised. Frequently, the reason for this is the failure to demilitarise. The successful transition to peace and democracy in South Africa, as elsewhere, depends on a process of demilitarisation that involves shifting power and resources away from armed formations and military elites.\n\n‘Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, represents, in the final analysis, a theft from those that hunger and are not fed, are cold and are not clothed.’\n\n– Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nSouth Africa is among some 40 countries that have changed from authoritarian to democratic rule over the past twenty years. In this political transition, restructuring the military is crucial. Huntington points out that ‘In almost all cases, the new democratic regimes have reduced the size of their military forces and attempted to instil in them a greater sense of military professionalism. By and large, the new democracies have been reasonably successful in establishing civilian control, in orienting their militaries towards professionalism, in reducing military power, in constricting military roles and in establishing patterns of civil-military relationships that resemble those in established democracies’ (Huntington, 1993:36). It is debatable whether South Africa has achieved this.\n\nThe shift from separate to sustainable development in South Africa\n\ndepends partly on how the new government deals with the military resources it has inherited from the apartheid era. These resources are extensive: the Government of National Unity (GNU) inherited the most powerful army in sub-Saharan Africa, with sophisticated weaponry, infrastructure and equipment, and an extensive arms manufacturing capability. South Africa became highly militarised during the period 1976-90 as resources were mobilised for war at political, economic and ideological levels (Cock & Nathan, 1989).\n\nHowever, a process of demilitarisation has been under way in South Africa for some time. This is evident in the closure of several military bases, in dramatic reductions in defence expenditure, in significant conversion initiatives in the defence industry, in the abolition of conscription, and in the downsizing of the military to conform to notions of a ‘core’ force. Thousands of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) personnel have been retrenched, retired or transferred in line with rationalisation programmes undertaken by the Department of Defence. The merger of eight different armed forces into the new SANDF involved significant moves towards the creation of a more representative structure. Demilitarisation is also indicated by the 1989 decision to dismantle the nuclear weapons industry and the 1997 ban on the use, production and trade in anti-personnel land-mines. Since 1994, attempts have been made to secure the subordination of the military to civilian control. These include the establishment of a Defence Secretariat and the re-examination of the mission, roles and tasks of the SANDF through the White Paper on Defence (1996) and the Defence Review.\n\n‘The military’s consumption of resources is illustrated by the fact that in the USA ‘an F-16 jet taking off for a regular training mission is likely to consume . . . almost twice as much gas as the average US motorist during one year.’\n\n– Birchem, 1992:2\n\nThe new policy framework is a significant break from the past. Laurie Nathan argues that the White Paper on Defence (1996), which sets the policy framework for the Defence Review, is ‘an agenda for demilitarisation’. However, it is arguable that the Defence Review has interpreted the Defence White Paper as an agenda for rearmament. The emphasis is on the creation of a modern, technologically advanced ‘core’ force. Furthermore, while prioritising the function of territorial defence, the new policy does not strictly limit the defence force to this and situations of national emergency. The provision in the Constitution for the deployment of the SANDF ‘for service in support of any department of state for the purpose of socio-economic upliftment’ [my emphasis] is problematic. The task of socio-economic upliftment belongs to other state agencies in co-operation with civilian society. Deploying soldiers in this role is reminiscent of the ‘winning hearts and minds’ programmes of the Total Strategy doctrine of the apartheid army, the South African Defence Force (SADF).\n\nIncreasing concern is voiced at the deployment of the SANDF in supporting the police in essentially political tasks. Internal deployment peaked at 20500 during the April 1994 elections. Gavin Cawthra points out that ‘this was a far more extensive operation than\n\nat any time during the State of Emergency and the SANDF claims that more troops were deployed internally at this stage than during the Angolan war’ (Cawthra, 1995:3). Although the numbers have declined, thousands of SANDF soldiers are still deployed on a daily basis in policing tasks.\n\nSANDF deployment in both roles – policing and development – is being used to legitimise military and defence expenditure. While Nathan argues that the ‘White Paper states explicitly that the new approach to security does not imply an expanded role for the armed forces’, Seegers points out that ‘the SANDF has warmed to civilianised and developmentalist notions of its tasks’ (Seegers, 1996:320). Most importantly, the secondary functions of the SANDF do not require a technologically advanced army. The SANDF has now completed the training of two battalions for peace-keeping operations. It is conceivable that the SANDF will playa role in regional crises, such as those in Lesotho and in the Great Lakes Region. However, participation in peace-keeping operations requires further public debate within a broad policy framework of demilitarisation.\n\nThe process of demilitarisation initiated in South Africa is complex and uneven, and has had some contradictory consequences. For instance, the proliferation of small arms is partly the outcome of incomplete disarmament and demobilisation in post-conflict peace building. This has increased the supply of guns and maverick banditry throughout the region and represents a form of privatised militarisation. Besides the private-public tension, there is a tension between the local and the global: the increasing emphasis on arms exports from South Africa is, to some extent, a consequence of the reduction in domestic defence procurement. The relation between development, defence and security cannot be considered in purely narrow, national terms. In addition, the ideology of militarism, which views violence as a legitimate solution to conflict and problems, remains intact. Demilitarisation needs to go beyond restructuring state institutions and recast social relations in a much broader project of social transformation. As the 1996 National Crime Prevention Strategy document asserts, ‘we need to weave a new social fabric, robust enough to withstand the stresses of rapid change in a new-born society.’\n\nOne has to acknowledge that the argument for demilitarisation rests on potential long-term benefits. In the short term it may produce additional costs; examples include the cost of paying and retraining demobilised soldiers, assisting arms industries in transition, and the environmental clean-up of former military bases. These may be costly enterprises, but the argument is that the costs involved in demilitarisation – in the transfer of resources for social and economic development – will help to tackle the real threats to collective security: environmental deterioration, poverty and social instability.\n\nThere is much agreement on which the demilitarisation debate can\n\nbuild. In some ways there is a converging of interests between the current military’s commitment to rationalisation and the demilitarisation movement’s conversion agenda. Military leaders stress that ‘downsizing and reshaping our defence force will save considerable funds’ (Deputy Minister Kasrils, cited in Sunday Independent, 1 December 1996). Both Kasrils and the White Paper on Defence clearly prioritise ‘the daunting task of addressing poverty and the socio-economic inequalities resulting from the system of apartheid’.\n\nThe argument for further demilitarisation is based on the negative impact of the military in terms of its direct destructive effects and the diversion of resources, skills and technology which could be employed in economic and social development. There is a need to move beyond the narrow understanding of conversion as referring mainly to shifting the defence industry to civilian production, to that of a multi-dimensional process involving the orderly redirection of human and material resources employed in military activities to development.\n\nThis broader understanding of ‘conversion’ was the objective of the Group for Environmental Monitoring (GEM) project ‘Redefining Security: Militarisation and the Ecology of Southern Africa’, initiated in 1993. GEM is committed to expanding the conceptual framework of conservation and conversion. The key notion is that we need to move beyond conservation in the sense of protecting threatened plants, animals and wilderness areas, to the broader understanding that conservation refers to the natural resource base on which all economic activity depends. While GEM is concerned broadly with linking concepts of biodiversity to sustainable development, this particular project aimed to conduct research that would empower civil society to engage meaningfully in debates about future defence policy.\n\nEnvironmentalists are concerned about defence issues for three reasons: because of the direct, negative impact on the environment; the military’s consumption of scarce resources; and the relation between environmental scarcity and conflict. As Gavin Cawthra argues, rethinking the notion of ‘security’ is the key to understanding the links between demilitarisation, environmental protection and sustainable development. The legacy of armed conflict over the last 30 years and the process of militarisation in southern. Africa have created a precarious, mutual vulnerability in the region. Current threat analyses confirm that there are no military threats. The White Paper on Defence (1996) acknowledges this and the Deputy Minister of Defence has admitted publicly that ‘there is no conventional enemy threatening to invade us’ (Ronnie Kasrils speaking on television, 6 October 1996). While Kasrils argues that, in an unpredictable world, one needs high defence expenditure as an insurance policy, this only makes sense if there is a strong likelihood of attack by a foreign power. Without this, security and defence needs have to take into\n\naccount the variety of security problems prompted by the effects of poverty, war, drought, disease and social dislocation. It is increasingly recognised that a broader concept of security – one which emphasises ecological and developmental factors – is necessary.\n\nRethinking security involves confronting a powerful paradox: that the military – the institution meant to ‘protect’ and ‘defend’ – in reality represents a threat to security. As Dr Rosalie Bertell, from the Toronto-based Institute of Concern for Public Health, stated at the World Women’s Congress for a Healthy Planet, in 1991: ‘It is the military who are destroying the earth, and they are doing so in the name of “national security.” ’ The Congress agreed that\n\nthe growth of huge military establishments, the hundreds of wars fought since the Second World War, the nuclear arms race and nuclear power development with their legacy of health-destroying nuclear wastes, and unrestricted trade in weaponry and lethal technology, via both governments and private dealers, dangerously pollute our natural environment. They destroy lives, damage the health of women, men, children, fetuses and other living creatures. They consume resources that could be used to benefit humankind, preserve biological diversity and protect our planet.\n\nThis paradox is clearest in the growing body of evidence on the disastrous environmental impact of military activity, including research, development, weapon production, testing manoeuvres, the presence of military bases and the disposal of toxic wastes, in addition to the direct impact of armed conflict.\n\nMilitarisation, poverty and the environment\n\nIf further evidence was required of the negative environmental consequences of military activity, the Gulf War has supplied it in abundance. The Gulf War demonstrated ‘that wars and environmental protection are incompatible’ (Renner, 1991:2). However, environmental damage is not limited to episodes of war and armed conflict, but is implicit in militarisation, the process whereby resources are mobilised for war. Military activities, even in peacetime, affect the environment. ‘Such activities include the production and testing of weapons, training and exercises, the establishment of military bases and installations, the maintenance of a state of alert and combat readiness, and accidents of various kinds’ (United Nations, 1991:12). Furthermore, military activities consume resources urgently needed for economic development and environmental protection. For example, approximately 20 per cent of the world’s scientists are engaged in military research to the detriment of research into environmental issues such as alternative energy sources and conservation. High\n\ndefence expenditure means that less is available for safeguarding our deteriorating environments.\n\nThe world’s armed forces ‘are a major cause of environmental degradation across the globe’ (Finger, 1991:220). Renner estimates that the military sector’s share of oil and energy use world-wide is about 3-4 per cent and double this if indirect use is included (Renner 1991). He also points out that about 0,5-1 per cent of the planet’s land mass is used for military bases alone. The operations of the armed forces may account for 6-10 per cent of global air pollution and the armed forces of the world are the largest producers of hazardous chemical and nuclear waste. Within the United States, the military is the largest generator of hazardous waste. The Pentagon’s annual toxic output – nearly 500 000 tons – exceeds that of the top five US chemical companies combined (Birchem, 1992:1).\n\nMost military bases world-wide ‘are probably heavily contaminated. The US Department of Defense has found almost 15 000 contaminated sites in about 1 600 military bases within the US alone. It is likely that the pollution problems are even worse on the US bases abroad’ (Finger, 1991:221). Thus ‘with its choreographed violence, the military destroys large tracts of the land it is supposed to protect’ (Birchem, 1992:2).\n\nThe relation between militarisation and environmental degradation is particularly obvious in the southern African region. The cost of SADF-sponsored wars in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe has been estimated as involving the loss of 1,5 million lives and US$45 billion since 1980 (Steiner, 1993:3). In 1992, the death toll in the Angolan civil war reached 1 000 per day. While the human and economic costs of these wars have been relatively well documented, their environmental impact has been neglected. Johnson and Martin maintain that the impact of apartheid on the region in ecological, economic and human terms ‘represents a holocaust’ (Johnson & Martin, 1989:11).\n\nEcologists returning to Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park and Maromeuy Delta report that the war has decimated much of the area’s wildlife. ‘All that is left are small numbers of the previously abundant impala, waterbuck, hartebeest and nyala’ (Dutton, 1994). Furthermore, there are reports that anti-personnel land-mines were sown in unmapped localities throughout these parks.\n\nAbout 20 million land-mines, or one-third of the world’s total, are located in southern Africa. Alex Vines relates how land-mines have been a major source of human injury and suffering. Angola has the highest rate of amputees in the world and there are millions of internal refugees displaced by the war in which the SADF played a central role. In 1996, the Kumleben Commission found that the SADF was involved in the illegal smuggling of ivory and rhino horn from Angola and Namibia from mid-1975 to 1986. The SADF has acknowledged that it ‘helped’ UNITA sell ivory from elephants killed during the Angolan war (General Magnus Malan, cited in The Star, 19 January 1996).\n\nThe Madimbo Corridor wilderness area in the Limpopo River valley has been degraded by military activities over decades. According to a recent report, ‘concrete slabs and abandoned buildings of old bases litter the wilderness and the area has been carved up by numerous roads now eroding into dongas in the sandy soil’ (Allen, 1996:7).\n\nAnother example of direct damage to environmental resources is evident in the SADF’s responsibility for herbicide contamination. In the 1970s, a sisal hedge was planted on the Zimbabwe border as a security barrier. The use of illegal and dangerous herbicides to remove it caused a major ecological disaster, contaminating farmers’ crops and natural vegetation along the Limpopo River. ‘Herbicide contamination was detected in soil in the Limpopo Valley and in water from Messina to the Kruger National Park’ (The Star, 22 February 1996).\n\nApart from direct environmental damage, general environmental deterioration – damage to the natural resource base on which all economic development activity depends – is a direct threat to security. Southern Africa could become caught in a cycle in which environmental scarcity and degradation lead to tensions, local disputes and\n\nviolence, which lead in turn to civil and inter-state wars, and thus to further environmental degradation. This has been termed the ‘greenwar factor’ – the recognition that ‘in the complex web of causes leading to social and political instability, bloodshed and war, environmental degradation is playing an increasingly important role’ (Bennett, 1991:2). As Raymond Williams warned, ‘the continuation of existing patterns of unequal consumption of the earth’s resources will lead us inevitably into various kinds of war, of different scales and extent’ (Williams, 1982:55). Southern Africa’s population of about 145 million is expected to double within the next 25 years, resulting in scarcities of some non-renewable resources, unless present consumption patterns are altered. Martin Rupiah indicates how water could become a source of conflict and tension in the region.\n\nOther direct threats are poverty and the proliferation of light weapons, which is linked to increasing rates of violent crime. A World Bank study established that almost half of South Africa’s population lives in poverty. In this study, poverty is defined as an income of R301 or less per adult per month. The study found that the bottom 20 per cent lived on an income of R118 or less per adult per month. These figures are cold and lifeless indicators of human misery, hunger and homelessness. At the same time, South Africa has one of the most unequal distributions of income in the world. The current defence budget clearly absorbs resources which could be invested in infrastructure such as housing, clinics and schools. Civil society needs to be empowered to question why the state is spending R875 million on 12 Rooivalk attack helicopters. The Rooivalk project has soaked up some R1,17 billion in research and development money and has failed to create more than a few hundred jobs. While much attention has been given to the relation between the military and political power in South Africa, as Feaver points out, ‘less obvious, but just as sinister, is the ability of the military to destroy society by draining it of resources’ (Feaver, 1996:152)\n\nAnother direct threat to security is the rising level of violent crime related to the proliferation of light weapons. Light weapons are a development issue: land-mines impede post-conflict social and economic recovery, and the availability of small arms exacerbates political violence and social instability, and has direct effects on economic development. Post-apartheid South Africa is undergoing a ‘domestic arms race’ in which sub-state groups (principally, organised crime and private citizens) have acquired arms and are contributing to the militarisation of society. Firearm killings are the fastest-growing form of violence in South Africa; every day, 19 people are murdered with a firearm. The main cause of the proliferation of light weapons is the armed conflict that has taken place in the region, and ineffective disarmament and demobilisation in post-conflict peace building. The main source of small arms is leakage from the various armed forma-\n\ntions involved in these conflicts. Many weapons are returning to South Africa in a ‘boomerang effect’. The solution to the problem of violent crime and the proliferation of light weapons is complex, but in the immediate short term it requires a massive shift of resources from the military to the police.\n\nContemporary changes in the character of armed conflict necessitate a rethinking of defence and security needs in global and local terms. The link between professional military establishments and the modern nation-state should be subject to critical scrutiny. There are strong grounds for questioning the existence of state military structures when the nature of war has changed from its conventional inter-state character. Almost all contemporary wars are civil wars. Virtually all of the conflict involves violence between internal groups (often ethnically defined) rather than states.\n\nThis leads to a crucial question which is at the centre of this book. How far should demilitarisation go? Armies and soldiers are not fixed and inevitable features of a nation-state, as the experiences of Costa Rica, Panama and Haiti show. President Figueres of Costa Rica has urged African nations to eliminate their armies if they really want development (The Star, 30 April 1996). The Costa Rican situation is very different from South Africa’s, but this is the ‘moment’ to radically rethink security and defence needs. Throughout the twentieth century, South African armed forces have never been used in a classic role to repel an invader. The SADF was used largely as an instrument of repression to maintain white rule. Since 1994, the SANDF has faced a crisis of legitimacy. Its response has been to try to position itself as a bastion of order. A frequent argument is that the SANDF needs to move away from offensive to pragmatic capabilities, such as participating in peacekeeping operations, border protection and disaster relief. It remains geared for offensive action north of the border. This is the logic behind the decision to purchase 12 Rooivalk attack\n\nhelicopters. According to an American expert, ‘my conversations with military planners in South Africa confirmed that they are going ahead to plan on the basis of conventional threats’ (personal communication from Charles Knight, Project on Defense Alternatives, April 1996). Paradoxically, there is simultaneous acknowledgement by military leaders that there are no conventional threats.\n\nWhile recognising that demilitarisation and conversion are contested concepts, the GEM project formulated in 1993 points to seven ways in which military resources could be redirected to environmental protection and sustainable development:\n\nIdeological conversion to a new understanding of security which emphasises its link to development and meeting human needs.\n\nConversion of land previously used as military bases.\n\nConversion of defence force personnel and equipment for development.\n\nDemobilisation, retraining and integration of ex-combatants into development institutions and programmes.\n\nConversion of informal military structures, such as self-defence\n\nunits, into development-related projects.\n\nConversion of the defence industry to civilian production.\n\nThe reallocation of defence expenditure.\n\nIdeological conversion: redefining security\n\nA broadened concept of ‘national security’ which emphasises the importance of ‘ecological security’ is emerging globally. It is increasingly recognised that defining national security largely in military terms fails to recognise many other crucial determinants. Real security can only be attained by reducing spending on armaments and systematically redirecting resources to meet critical human and environmental needs. Real defence is making people stronger by meeting their basic needs. There can be no better fortification than a healthy, well-housed and literate population.\n\nKaplan argues that West Africa is becoming ‘the symbol of world-wide demographic, environmental and societal stress in which criminal anarchy emerges as the real strategic danger’ (Kaplan, 1994:46). In his analysis, ‘environmental scarcity’ is ‘the national-security issue of the early 21st century’ (Kaplan, 1994:58). Similarly, the former UNCED Secretary-General Maurice Strong maintained that ‘our security is threatened more by environmental risk than by traditional military conflicts’ (Disarmament Times, March 1992).\n\nA distinction has been drawn between the old ‘world order of the last half century organised around ideological conflict’ and a new world order ‘organised around environmental sustainability’. From this perspective, high defence expenditure has been compared to dismantling a house in order to erect a fence around it. The implication is that a shift of resources is necessary away from military preparations (with their toxic, polluting side-effects) in favour of environmental restoration and sustainable development.\n\nIn the old or traditional approach, security was about preserving state sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity. Security was defined as a military issue. However, Nathan has pointed out that this approach has a number of shortcomings: it ignores the underlying reasons for conflict, consumes resources and neglects the various forms of non-violent conflict resolution. This statist and militarist approach to security creates what is termed the ‘security dilemma’. ‘The military steps taken by a state to enhance its security may induce insecurity in other states, particularly those with which it has adversarial relations. The inevitable reaction of those states is to heighten their own military preparedness. As the arms race escalates, war preparations become more likely to cause than prevent hostilities’ (Nathan, 1994:2).\n\nThe new concept of ecological security is linked to economic development and human rights. In 1991, it was proposed that a ‘security basket or calabash’ link security, stability, co-operation and develop-\n\nThe consequences of civil war in Angola (Photo: Mail & Guardian)\n\nment in the African continent. The Conference on Security, Stability, Development and Co-operation, held in Kampala, motivated for the notion of ‘common security’ on the grounds that the problems experienced by individual African countries are shared problems, and that instability in one state inevitably reduces the stability of neighbouring states. The implication is that security should not only be defined at the level of nation-states, but linked to larger issues of global security and smaller issues of personal security.\n\nIn this sense, the notion of human security has always been implicit in the concept of development. Its dimensions include:\n\npersonal and physical security, including a safe and healthy environment;\n\neconomic security, including access to employment;\n\nsocial security, including protection from discrimination based on age or social status, combined with access to ‘safety nets’;\n\npolitical security, including access to justice and protection from abuse; and\n\nethnic and cultural security – ‘a social climate in which minority populations feel secure in expressing their cultural identity’ (Buttedahl, 1995:14).\n\nIn the ‘old’ South Africa, in the period of Total Strategy, security was defined primarily with reference to white domination and military power. It is only now that we are beginning to learn of the killing and torture perpetrated by the apartheid state in the name of national\n\nsecurity. Current threat analyses focus on the variety of security problems in the southern African region resulting from poverty, drought, disease and social dislocation. In the ‘new’ South Africa, security is defined primarily by meeting basic needs.\n\nThere is a need to move away from the narrow statist and militarist concept of security as defence from external aggression, to a more holistic approach which recognises that security is a multi-faceted concept with economic, social, political and ecological dimensions. The White Paper on Defence (1996) represents a significant shift in this direction.\n\nThe conversion of military bases to alternative land use\n\nDemilitarisation involves the closure of some military bases and the dismantling of military installations. Base re-use is complicated by environmental damage and the economic dependence of local communities, but in Penny Mckenzie’s pioneering research there are strong ethical arguments for the redistribution of military land. The redistribution of SANDF land was one of the demands made at the National Land Committee Conference held in February 1994, attended by 700 delegates from 353 rural and landless communities. This demand was echoed in a GEM workshop held in 1996, and could resonate – to a limited extent – with SANDF rationalisation plans.\n\nIn 1991 the SANDF was the fourth-largest land-controlling authority in South Africa, managing some 60 military facilities which cover approximately 600 000 hectares of land. According to a military source, ‘These facilities are used for a variety of military purposes including training personnel, for ammunition depots, for air force bases, for shooting and bombing ranges, and for weapon testing sites’ (Godshalk, 1991:10).\n\nHowever, there are allegations that the military has occupied pristine land for recreational purposes. There are reports that one of the most attractive camps in the Kruger National Park – Jakkalsbessie - operated for years as a secret SADF camp. There have been reports that the SANDF has built a multi-million rand, 16-bed luxury camp, on pristine coastal dune at the mouth of KwaZulu-Natal’s Kosi Bay, one of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the country. According to a press report ‘there is evidence that what was presented as a small operations base has become a holiday lodge for top-ranking officers’ (Sunday Independent, 6 October 1996).\n\nThis book relates how some military land was acquired through the dispossession and forced removal of communities under the apartheid regime. Documentation by the Surplus People Project (SPP) indicates that the SADF benefited from at least four forced removals. One of these occurred in 1973, when 1500 people were moved from Riemvasmaak near Upington, after the area was declared a military zone. An SPP spokesperson described the removals as ‘one of the\n\nmost cruel of all the removals that were taking place around that time. This peace-loving and settled community was divided along racial lines and then – according to how officials had chosen to categorise them – sent to different destinations. Those whom the state chose to call Xhosa were sent to the Ciskei 1 000 km away and those classified Damara were sent out of South Africa to Damaraland in Namibia over 1 300 km away.’ Houses were burned in front of the people’s eyes.\n\nIn 1993, the Riemvasmaak community applied to the Commission on Land Allocation for permission to return, and did so on 21 May 1994. Riemvasmaak has been used as a model of restitution. However, the community’s legal representative, Henk Smith, has pointed out that ‘restitution entails more than the acquisition of lost land. It involves good planning, resettlement of people, provision of infrastructure and services, economic support programmes, sustainable development and community institution building’ (Winberg, 1994:24). Minister Derek Hanekom stresses that Riemvasmaak demonstrates ‘the value of mediation and negotiation in the restitution process’ (ibid.).\n\nThe SADF also benefited from the forced removal of 3 500 people from the shores of Lake St Lucia between 1968 and 1979, to establish a missile testing range, and about 3 500 people were removed from the Makatini flats in Zulu land in 1972 and 1973 when a buffer zone was established between Mozambique and Natal (Sunday Times, 4 October 1992).\n\nLohatla, in the Northern Cape, is a removal site that is generating intense controversy. Two black communities – the Maremane and Gatlhose – were forcibly removed in 1977 to allow the SADF to build the world’s second-largest battle school. A third group, the Khosis, resisted removal. These displaced groups have claimed back parts of the battle school, which covers 135 000 hectares of land. Despite these claims, the SANDF engages in massive war games on this site against a phantom enemy.\n\nBoth Lohatla and Riemvasmaak demonstrate the problems of military contamination. There have been several cases of injury to local people thought to have been caused by unexploded ordnance. The question of military contamination is dramatised by the use of land-mines as offensive weapons in southern Africa.\n\nHowever, there are precedents for the conversion of military land: a nature reserve – Greefswald, near Messina – was handed over to the provincial administration. There are plans to develop the whole Limpopo Valley as an ecotourism destination and as part of a system of trans-frontier national parks.\n\nThe question of trans-frontier ‘peace parks’ is another dimension of the land conversion issue. This is anchored in the idea that co-operation across political borders around the management of common\n\nnatural resources can simultaneously enhance regional peace and security, and protect biological diversity in the region. However, Koch (1995), for example, has questioned whether the peace park process can promote social development in the region.\n\nRedeploying troops and equipment in development projects\n\nThe conversion of human resources is an important challenge for the military and one that is discussed in this book by Rocky Williams. A ‘swords into ploughshares’ report by a United Nations study group recommends developing mechanisms for transferring some of the world’s vast military resources to environmental protection and development programmes – for example, using military-related satellites and other information-gathering systems for global monitoring and sharing environmental data, and creating UN international environmental disaster relief teams. The ‘Green Helmets’, akin to the UN’s ‘Blue Berets’ peacekeeping teams, would rush to scenes of environmental disaster to provide emergency assistance, measure damage and help to enforce treaty provisions by verifying compliance.\n\nMany governments are reducing the size of their military establishments and some of the human, material and technological resources in this sector are being deployed in environmental protection. In China, military personnel and aircraft have participated in tree planting, forest protection and emergency relief work. In Germany, surveillance flights by special aircraft help to discover and monitor oil spills. A German scout tank, used to detect chemical weapons and radioactive contamination under battlefield conditions, has been modified to detect air and soil pollution.\n\nIn Sweden, army helicopters, tracking vehicles and bridging equipment have been used in a variety of environmental emergencies such as wildfires, snowstorms and floods. Both army and navy units have been used to deal with oil spills. Ships with hazardous cargo are monitored by naval command posts. In Brazil, the armed forces provide logistic support to institutions charged with environmental protection. For example, navy units survey extensive areas of the Amazonian forest and territorial waters to prevent the smuggling of endangered species and illegal fishing. Ghana has used its armed forces to increase the mobility, accessibility and monitoring capabilities of the National Environmental Protection Council. On request, the air force carries out reconnaissance flights to monitor encroachments on forest reserves, land usage and desertification, poaching, the use of illegal fishing methods, dumping at sea, and coastal pollution and erosion.\n\nIt is debatable whether the military is the best institution to perform these tasks. The South African Constitution provides for an extensive role for the SANDF. Its responsibilities are ‘To defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of South Africa; to fulfil South\n\nAfrica’s international obligations; to preserve life, health and property; to provide or maintain essential services; to uphold law and order, in co-operation with the police; and to support socio-economic upliftment.’ The White Paper on Defence suggests that socio-economic upliftment involves three dimensions for the SANDF: meeting basic needs, building the economy and developing human resources. It is anticipated that the Service Corps (SC) will play a major role in the last respect.\n\nThe SANDF has resources, equipment, skills and infrastructure which could be of considerable benefit to reconstruction and development. In terms of infrastructure, according to the Director of Programming and Budgeting in the SANDF Finance Division, South African Navy facilities could be made available for training in diving, signals, catering and computers, and there are South African Air Force facilities with existing infrastructure available at Hoedspruit and Pienaarsrivier (Van der Merwe, 1994). The SANDF could also be involved in adult education and literacy, in providing health facilities through the South African Medical Services (SAMS), and in loaning earth-moving and other construction equipment. There is a valuable repository of skills in the South African Army Engineer Formation and the SAMS.\n\nHowever, there are profound dangers attached to SANDF involvement in the RDP. One argument is that, given the militarised nature of South Africa’s past, the new defence force should be limited to territorial defence and not deployed in socio-economic development. It has been suggested that such an expanded role would strengthen the military’s legitimacy and block the demilitarisation process.\n\nThe 70 000 personnel force level projected for the new army will be extremely costly to maintain. South Africa faces no conventional military threat and a large standing army could constitute a political danger. Huntington has warned that, in societies which have undergone democratic transition, ‘the absence of a foreign threat . . . may leave the military devoid of a legitimate military mission, and enhance their inclination to think about politics’ (Huntington, 1993:63). The force levels of the new army reflect a tension between social and defence needs. The current emphasis on social needs is influenced by the immense political danger which a compulsory and harsh reduction in numbers would pose, unless linked to a comprehensive demobilisation programme.\n\nIn terms of environmental issues, the SANDF could arguably be deployed in tasks similar to those undertaken in Ghana, Brazil and Sweden. The Environmental Services Division of the SANDF requires further investigation, as do the ways in which other countries utilise the military in environmental projects. India may be the most successful example of the use of armed forces for environmental protection. At the National Defence Academy, a crash course in conserva-\n\ntion is part of the syllabus. ‘Every major Indian army formation has an environmental “cell” which is expected to maintain a close liaison with the Ministry of the Environment, Forests and Wildlife. Vast areas of degraded and semi-desert land have been reclaimed by tree-planting, irrigation schemes and protection of wildlife’ (World Disarm, 1992:7).\n\nIt is necessary to debate the deployment of SANDF personnel in non-military roles and probe the implications of non-offensive defence. This is a strategy, materialised in a national posture, that emphasises defensive rather than offensive military options.\n\nRetraining ex-combatants in developmental programmes\n\nMeasures providing for the social integration of demobilised soldiers form a crucial part of the demilitarisation process and have been analysed by Penny Mckenzie and Tsepe Motumi in this book. Demobilised soldiers represent potentially both a security threat and a personnel resource. While demobilised soldiers may have demonstrated exceptional levels of courage and commitment, as a social category they usually have limited skills beyond military training, a disrupted education and minimal employment experience. They are therefore ill-equipped to compete in the civilian labour market.\n\nDemobilisation is seen by the World Bank and other international agencies and development groups as perhaps the most critical step in a country’s post-conflict reconstruction. Various demobilisation schemes in Africa have proved problematic. For instance, the attempt in Zimbabwe to deploy some 9 000 ex-combatants in agricultural work, Soldiers Employed in Economic Development (SEED), collapsed very quickly (Oloa, 1991, cited by Cock, 1993). At the end of the war in Namibia, some 40 000 former PLAN and SWATF combatants were demobilised, and only 5 000 (mainly PLAN) fighters were selected to join the new Namibian Defence Force, which was increased to nearer 7 000 in 1991. The Development Brigade centres set up to provide training and short-term employment for ex-combatants encountered many problems (NSER, 1991, cited by Cock, 1993). In Mozambique, demobilised soldiers were a major source of instability, despite a demobilisation scheme involving altogether 45 000 personnel, which included transport to the district of their choice and six months’ salary as ‘a personal incentive to actively reintegrate into economic and social life’ (Republic of Mozambique, 1992:4). The African country with the most successful demobilisation scheme is probably Uganda, which has been working since 1992 to demobilise 42 000 soldiers and reduce its army by half, with funds raised by the World Bank.\n\nA key aspect of reconstruction and development in South Africa is the development of human resources through various forms of training and education. A number of demobilisation strategies which could contribute to human resource development should be explored.\n\nIt is suggested that we need a ‘Soldiers’ Charter’ similar to that which benefited many white, male ex-soldiers after the Second World War. This could include access to training institutions similar to that provided by the GI Bill in the US (Cock, 1994).\n\nConversion of informal military structures\n\nInformal military structures are a legacy of the militarisation of South African society. There are initiatives under way to convert these informal structures, such as self-defence units (SDUs), to civilian purposes. For example, in this book Adele Kirsten reports how the Peace Corps in Daveyton trains people in conflict resolution. Another project, involving the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, trains ex-SDU members in group building skills and organisational management, and is planning to offer job training in relation to small business development, a youth advice centre and the establishment of a recycling centre. The last is of special interest in terms of environmental protection and sustainable development. There are also reports from the East Rand that former SDU guerrillas operate as tour guides to sites of violent conflict in Tokoza and Katlehong.\n\nConversion of the defence industry\n\nUnder the apartheid regime, South Africa developed a massive arms industry. At its hub lay the Armaments Development and Production Corporation (Armscor) which ‘made South Africa the world’s tenth-largest armaments exporter, supplying perhaps 30 different countries across the globe’ (Baynham, 1990:405).\n\nArmscor plans to expand arms exports by 300 per cent in the next five years, increasing arms sales to approximately R2,4 billion (Willett, 1994). These plans are generating debate, particularly in view of the evidence presented to the Cameron Commission, which exposed Armscor’s sales of weapons to a number of war-ravaged countries. For example, there is evidence that Armscor sold R100 million worth of weaponry to the Rwandan government in the five years prior to October 1993. There have also been allegations that South Africa supplied a further R50 million worth of weapons to the Hutu forces during June 1994, after the main acts of genocide against the Tutsi population had taken place.\n\nRecent cancellations of sales to Rwanda do not detract from the reality that South Africa has become a major player in the global arms market with $272 million worth of exports in the 1995/6 financial year to 58 different countries (Jane’s Defence Weekly, 8 May 1996). Despite the formal criteria established by the new arms control body, the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), and statements from President Mandela and the Department of Foreign Affairs on the country’s commitment to disarmament and ‘of making\n\nour world a more friendly place to live in’ (Department of Foreign Affairs, 1996), South Africa contributes to violent conflict, repression and the erosion of human rights and welfare throughout the world.\n\nThe conclusion is that, in both local and global terms, South Africa’s arms industry is a source of moral contamination. It has played a crucial role in maintaining the apartheid regime and its exports have supported wars and oppressive regimes around the world; it should therefore be dismantled. Arguments about the benefits of the arms industry in terms of jobs, foreign exchange and international prestige are devoid of ethical considerations.\n\nEconomist arguments maintain that the defence industry is a national asset, a crucial repository of advanced technology, skills and expertise and, on the basis of the jobs and foreign exchange it generates, should be protected. However, according to Peter Batchelor, research indicates that the economic benefits are greatly exaggerated, especially when taxpayer subsidies and offsets are subtracted. Furthermore, the arms industry absorbs disproportionate numbers of science and technology graduates and skilled technicians. As Willett and Batchelor write, ‘Many studies suggest that arms production is inefficient and expensive. It may encourage growth in the short run, but it distorts the structure of the national economy in the long run and has only limited export potential, particularly at present when international demand for weapons systems is declining and the arms market is saturated’ (Willett & Batchelor, 1994:4).\n\nIt has been claimed that, in 1993, South Africa’s arms exports generated 15 000 jobs and only accounted for between 0,7 and 1,3 per cent of total annual exports during the last decade. From these figures, Batchelor concludes that the defence sector’s contribution to overall economic performance is far less significant than claimed. If the value of government subsidies is removed from annual sales, the contribution of South Africa’s arms exports to the balance of trade and the balance of payments is marginal.\n\nEconomists such as Willett, Batchelor and Fine argue that the economic costs of the domestic defence industry outweigh the benefits, and that the future must involve a careful conversion to civilian production with the co-operation of government, industry and the trade unions. There are difficulties with conversion at plant level, but there is also evidence that the process is under way in South Africa. Until 1990, the mechanical engineering company Reumech was oriented towards military output, but has been successfully transformed into a manufacturer of commercial products, and is only about 50 per cent dependent on the defence market (The Star, 6 June 1996). However, these initiatives need to be part of a holistic approach to demilitarisation and understood as part of industrial restructuring.\n\nWhile the social and moral impact of the arms industry is subject to increasing debate, its environmental impact has not been system-\n\nically investigated.\n\nGenerally, weapon production and testing involve considerable environmental degradation. Several reserves in South Africa have been used as missile testing sites. In 1991, 72 000 hectares of land at St Lucia, parts of which had been used as a weapons testing ground since 1968, were transferred to the Natal Parks Board. There are reports that weapons testing caused considerable environmental damage in a pristine area from Cape Vidal to Sodwana (Saturday Argus, 12 October 1996). An Armscor demonstration of a multiple rocket launcher resulted in a massive fire which raged across St Lucia for days (The Star, 7 June 1991). In 1996 about 20 powerful surface-to-surface missiles, at least six of which were live, were discovered in the area (Saturday Argus, 12 October 1996). It should be noted that St Lucia was one of the first four conservation areas to be proclaimed in Africa in 1987. It is a designated wetland of international significance under the RAMSAR Convention.\n\nDe Hoop Nature Reserve, near Arniston in the Western Cape, is still a military zone and used for testing ballistic missiles developed by Armscor. This is where South Africa, in conjunction with Israel, tested an intercontinental missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n\nReallocation of defence expenditure\n\nIncreasing numbers of South Africans are concerned about high levels of defence expenditure – now R10,5 billion, which amounts to about 2 per cent of GDP. Although it has decreased in real terms by 50 per cent since 1989, South Africa still has the largest defence budget in Africa. A commitment to a ‘technologically advanced military force’ is extremely expensive. The Defence Review advocated the purchase of major items such as naval patrol vessels, submarines, jet fighters and 12 Rooivalk attack helicopters as support for ground troops. Kasrils has argued that these purchases will enable South Africa to acquire military hardware while creating jobs and training opportunities. But it has been clearly established by scholars such as Nicole Ball and Paul Dunne that defence spending has a negative effect on economic growth. Planned, orderly reductions in defence spending could mean alternative investment in sustainable development generally and environmental management programmes specifically. At the very least, every defence expense must be considered in relation to a host of competing demands for resources to meet basic needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe process of democratisation in South Africa is extremely fragile. Now that a pluralist political system and universal franchise have been secured, the consolidation of democracy depends on the trans-\n\nformation of economic and social relations. This requires a shifting of power and resources away from the military to social and economic development.\n\nThere are seven areas in which this could be achieved in a planned, orderly and holistic way. The conversion and reallocation of military resources to alleviate poverty and environmental degradation should be priorities. As Eisenhower said, ‘Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, represents, in the final analysis, a theft from those that hunger and are not fed, are cold and are not clothed.’ In South Africa, the victims of ‘theft’ are the 40 per cent of the population who live in poverty. In the interests of both justice and social stability their needs must be met.\n\nFor this to happen, civil society needs to be empowered. Debates on defence policy issues are not particularly well informed and there is no strong, mass-based demilitarisation movement to challenge the power of the defence establishment. This is a serious problem. In developing countries, but especially in Africa, the military has accumulated power and resources, and subverted democracy partly because civil society has lacked the capacity to engage with it. Healthy civil-military relations require the empowerment of civil society to engage with defence issues; to challenge insider security expert assessment of security needs and budget justification. Further research and public debate on a multi-dimensional conversion programme are urgently needed. It is hoped that the publication of this book will advance that process.\n\nSouth Africa’s post-apartheid government has inherited the most powerful armed forces in Africa south of the Sahara. This military power was achieved at considerable expense during the apartheid era. By the late 1980s:\n\ndefence spending had increased to around one-quarter of the state\n\nbudget and 5 per cent of GDP;\n\nwhite adult males faced 14 years of intermittent military service, including two years of full-time duty;\n\nthe defence industry constituted the largest manufacturing sector;\n\na nuclear capability had been developed; and\n\ngovernment was largely in the hands of the military-dominated National Management System, which became the engine of counter-revolution during successive states of emergency.\n\nWhile South Africa was never under military rule as such, the defence force exerted a strong influence over state policy. Development objectives were linked to security imperatives and the defence force had first-call on the state budget. ‘Strategic’ industries, including defence, petroleum, and iron and steel, were prioritised in efforts to achieve self-reliance in the face of a hostile world (Cawthra, 1986).\n\nConsiderable demilitarisation took place under the presidency of F.W. de Klerk:\n\nthe National Management System was disbanded;\n\ndefence spending was cut by 40 per cent (although much of the money saved was transferred to the police);\n\nthe defence industry went into sharp decline;\n\nconscription was reduced;\n\nunilateral nuclear disarmament took place; and\n\ngreater civil control was asserted over the military.\n\nThe process of demilitarisation was far from complete by May 1994, when the ANC-led Government of National Unity (GNU) was inaugurated. The new government adopted a development-oriented programme stressing the need for economic growth and distribution, the extension and consolidation of democracy, and the improvement of social conditions. These priorities were incorporated into the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). However, even within the ANC and its alliance partners, there was disagreement over the extent to which the new priorities should be funded by further defence cuts. Furthermore, the relationship between defence spending, the defence industry and economic growth was disputed.\n\nThese disagreements were sharpened when it came to defining defence budgets. The 1994/5, 1995/6, 1996/7 and 1997/8 budgets resulted in cuts in military spending. (Although 1994/5 showed a slight increase due to the short-term cost of integrating the various armed formations, with integration costs excluded, there was a 13 per cent cut.) In the 1997/8 budget, defence was allocated R9,579 billion (US$2,1 billion) – about 5,2 per cent of government expenditure and 1,5 per cent of GDP. With the defence budget halved since 1989, and well within the target of 2 per cent of GDP recommended by the World Bank for developing countries, it would appear that those\n\nadvocating demilitarisation have won a decisive victory.\n\nHowever, the defence force has been agitating for new equipment – notably naval corvettes and Rooivalk helicopters. This has proved another source of disagreement. Many argue that the money would be better spent on the RDP, while the defence ministry insists that new purchases are vital to prevent ‘block obsolescence’, and to protect South Africa’s sovereignty and economic interests.\n\nThese debates indicate that, for the first time in South Africa, it is possible to have a reasonably open discussion on key questions related to defence, security and development. The White Paper on Defence, adopted by parliament in May 1996, and the subsequent Defence Review, were the result of a wide-ranging and open consultative process. To some extent policy was still made in ‘smoke-filled rooms’, but the new South Africa has approached defence policy-making with a degree of transparency and accountability that compares favourably with that of advanced democracies.\n\nNew approaches to security\n\nAt the heart of the new debate is a different concept of security. In a narrow sense, security and development are two issues. During the Cold War, security was seen as defence by a sovereign state from external aggression. Since the end of the Cold War, this concept has been progressively modified: security has been widened to embrace social, economic and political issues, and both trans-national and subnational factors (Buzan, 1991; Booth, 1991).\n\nThis holistic approach to security is becoming commonplace; it pervades the ANC’s security policies. It is, however, not entirely new, and it contains a number of sand-traps for those seeking to employ it in the service of demilitarisation. In apartheid South Africa between 1977 and 1989 (roughly the period of P.W. Botha’s presidency) a multi-faceted security strategy was implemented, involving economic, social and political dimensions as well as military prowess. However, this Total Strategy proved extraordinarily reductionist in its concept of a communist total onslaught into which it categorised virtually all significant opposition to apartheid. As the crisis deepened in the 1980s, Total Strategy fell back onto military and police repression, and counter-insurgency doctrine.\n\nThe ANC, in its policy documents, has argued for a multi-faceted or holistic approach to security. This is based on democratisation of all aspects of life: ‘security should not be restricted to military, police and intelligence matters, but . . . political, economic, social and environmental dimensions . . . Underdevelopment, poverty, lack of democratic participation and abuse of human rights are regarded as grave threats to the security of people’ (ANC, 1992: Section Q2). This approach is implicit in the RDP. Peace and security form one of the\n\nsix principles of the RDP as originally formulated by the ANC. ‘An integrated programme, based on the people, that provides peace and security for all and builds the nation, links reconstruction and development and deepens democracy – these are the six basic principles of the RDP’ (ANC 1994: Sections 1.3.4, 1.3.8).\n\nTo talk of an integrated programme begs the question of the exact relationship between defence and development: on this the RDP – both in its original formulation by the ANC and in the White Paper issued by the GNU – is virtually silent.\n\nDefence expenditure and economic development\n\nUnfortunately, most studies of the effect of the armament process and the build-up of military forces on economic performance deal with developed industrial countries, and have little relevance to a developing country like South Africa. Nevertheless, since the late 1960s, the effect of militarisation in developing countries has been the focus of considerable research, particularly as many have fallen to military coups.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some researchers argued that the military were modernisers. With their managerial-technical capabilities, often lacking in civil society, they could marshal the resources of the state for nation-building. This was the argument that P.W. Botha used when he ushered the military into the political decision-making process at the end of the 1970s, with consequences that led South Africa to the brink of civil war. The appalling experiences of military rule in Argentina, Chile, Burma, several Middle East countries and literally dozens of African countries have effectively put paid to arguments supporting a developmental role for the military.\n\nEven if soldiers stay safely in their barracks, there is the complex question of the relationship between investment in armed forces and defence industries and socio-economic development. For some time the debate centred on the study made by Benoit in 1973, in which he\n\nconcluded that, in some circumstances, growth in GNP in developing countries was linked to increased military expenditure (Benoit, 1973).\n\nEconomists tend to agree that high or increasing levels of military spending detract from economic growth in developing countries, especially over the long term. However, there may be particular circumstances where increased investment in the military and defence industries helps to kick-start an industrialisation process (Deger & Smith, 1983:335-53; Looney & Winterford, 1995:124; Willett & Batchelor, 1994; Fine, 1993:4).\n\nThe limited studies tend to indicate that the defence industry, and defence expenditure as a whole, detract from economic growth, although the extent is debated. However, this conclusion obscures a number of issues. Firstly, GDP growth is not necessarily development. Uneven growth which marginalises certain groups, growth which focuses on wealth creation rather than the provision of social services, health and education, and jobless growth is not development. A far more useful indicator would be to compare improvement in the Human Development Index (HDI)l with military expenditure.\n\nIt is common sense that countries which spend a lot on armaments will have less to spend on health, education and other social services. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has argued that developing countries need to move away from spending on\n\ndefence for the state (more often the regime in power rather than the people) and towards ‘human security’. While poor countries’ defence expenditure is a fraction of developed countries’ spending, channelling it towards human security would make a huge difference (Ul Haq, 1995). In part, this is happening. Developing countries’ spending on defence peaked at the end of the 1980s and has been declining since then (although the process is uneven – for example, expenditure in East Asia is increasing rapidly). This is not necessarily a result of political elites coming to their senses: the causes include constant debt (preventing the import of arms), donor pressures, the end of military client arrangements with the superpowers, and the implosion of states.\n\nNevertheless, many developing countries spend a greater proportion of their GDP on defence than developed countries, although there are discrepancies. There is little correlation between military rule and military spending – civilian governments are often the biggest spenders. Why do some developing countries spend more on defence than others? Why do developing countries’ governments continue to spend on defence when they face pressing social problems? More to the point, given that these governments are usually threatened by internal unrest originating in social deprivation, poverty, marginalisation, environmental degradation and ethnic exclusion, why do they ‘waste’ money on defence? It has been calculated that for one modern jet fighter, schooling could be offered to a million children. Surely this would be a better guarantee of security?\n\nThere are no simple answers. Patronage, the international arms market, elite formations and ideology all playa part. Most developing countries are ruled by weak regimes which lack legitimacy and are marginalised in the world system. As a result, they have become ‘obsessed with security’, leading to military spending, a high political profile for the military and the distortion of economic development priorities for security reasons (Ayoob, 1995:192). Furthermore, militaries have become powerful actors within weak states, as witnessed by the succession of coups in Africa.\n\nThe dilemma is that, for development to occur, there needs to be a degree of stability and the state needs to be able to carry out some functions. If this is achieved though militarism or military dictatorship it usually proves anti-developmental. Development will depend on the evolution of a strong civil society and a democratic system in which human security is achieved. It is difficult to see how the poorest countries are ever going to reach the point where both state and human security requirements are met. While Africa has undergone a wave of democratisation, this is very fragile and periodic reversions to military intervention in politics appear inevitable.\n\nHealth workers marching in April 1990 (Photo by Rafs Mayet)\n\nThe SANDF and the RDP\n\nWhat of the defence force, and its possible role in socio-economic development and in delivering the RDP? A key aspect of the RDP is the development of human resources, and it is in this respect that South Africa is least competitive internationally. The military demobilisation and rationalisation process could assist in the development of human resources if soldiers are properly retrained and their skills converted for use in civil society. A successful historical example is the GI Bill passed in the United States after the Second World War, where demobilised soldiers were given educational credits to study at the academic or training institution of their choice. The ‘Soldiers’ Charter’ in South Africa benefited white male ex-soldiers. But there are considerable dangers inherent in demobilisation if former military personnel are not properly reintegrated into civil society.\n\nThe SANDF has already provided an inventory of facilities and resources it might offer to the RDP. This includes training and education (adult education and literacy), the provision of health facilities through the South African Medical Services, and the loaning of earth-moving or other construction equipment (De Kock, 1994). The SANDF clearly has resources, equipment and human skills of use to the RDP, especially as much of it is underutilised due to the demilitarisation process. It also has a formidable logistics capability which has been used to excellent effect during times of crisis.\n\nIt is tempting for those involved in the RDP to look to the SANDF for logistical and other help. There seem to be compelling reasons for the SANDF’s involvement in a new war against poverty and inequality. Nevertheless, there are profound dangers, both for civil society and for the defence force. It is not in the long-term interests of the SANDF to be too involved in civilian development issues. This detracts from its primary role of protecting the sovereignty of South Africa and its people. Prolonged exposure to such tasks will also, inevitably, have a politicising effect. Armies are not necessarily as efficient or as cost-effective as they might seem (Ball, 1988). Military equipment is far more costly than civilian equipment and soldiers are often expensively trained – it is clearly not cost-effective to use armoured vehicles to bring in a potato crop.\n\nFor these reasons, care should be taken at the outset to determine exactly under what conditions the defence force involves itself in the RDP. As with peacekeeping operations, it may be easier to get in than to get out, and unless objectives and time-frames are determined in advance, it could become a protracted and increasingly messy engagement.\n\nThis cautious approach is government policy, as expressed in the White Paper on Defence (1996). Nevertheless, the government has accepted that, under exceptional circumstances, service delivery by other departments might break down – for example, through natural disasters – and the SANDF’s expertise might be needed. The White Paper specifies that, under such circumstances, ‘the employment should be requested from the Department of Defence (DOD) by the relevant government department; it should have the consent of the affected community; it should have a limited time duration; and it should be subject to civilian control’ (Department of Defence, 1996: 31).\n\nWhere surplus capacity is involved, it may be wise to look at conversion to civilian use. The SANDF is already engaged in negotiations with other government departments for the handover of land and facilities. The same can be done with some vehicles, equipment, and health and welfare facilities now surplus to requirements (although many of these are unsuitable for civilian use or too expensive to maintain for these purposes).\n\nWhile the RDP cannot be delivered in a climate of lawlessness and disorder, it is evident that high levels of investment in security will deny resources to the RDP and hinder its implementation. Arguments for justifying defence expenditure on the grounds of RDP support are unsound.\n\nDefence and development within the SADC\n\nSouth Africa’s development-oriented approach to security, resting on a commitment to human security and the consolidation of democra-\n\ncy, has been echoed in the approach adopted by the Southern African Development Community (SADC). South Africa is committed to regional development and security, and regards the two as closely related. The 1994 RDP White Paper is unequivocal:\n\nA central proposal of the RDP is that we cannot build the Southern African economy in isolation from its neighbours . . . If South Africa attempted to dominate its neighbours, it would restrict their growth, reducing their potential as markets, worsening their unemployment and causing increased migration to South Africa. If it seeks mutual co-operation it can develop a large, stable market offering stable employment and common labour standards in all areas (RSA, 1994: Section 1.4.14).\n\nThis commitment to co-operation for development is paralleled by support for ‘common security’. The SADC states will shape their political, security and defence policies in co-operation with each other. Many problems are shared and ignore borders: refugees, environmental degradation, trafficking in drugs and light weapons. While the White Paper on Defence supports a co-operative approach to defence (sharing of intelligence, logistics, training and the adoption of common doctrines) it points out that most of the region’s security problems are non-military and require political and economic solutions (Department of Defence, 1996: Chapter 4).\n\nThe SADC has taken on political and security tasks, and economic development functions. An Organ on Politics, Security and Defence, functioning at presidential, ministerial and technical levels, was established during 1996. It was charged with a list of tasks, including:\n\npreventive diplomacy;\n\nharmonising foreign policies;\n\nconflict resolution;\n\nfacilitating peacekeeping;\n\ncollective security;\n\nmutual defence from external aggression; and\n\npolice, intelligence and defence co-operation (SADC, 1996).\n\nThe Inter-State Defence and Security Committee, an extensive network of committees overseeing defence, police and intelligence co-operation, forms the backbone of the Organ.\n\nThe SADC has called for a new approach to security in which socio-economic development and the consolidation of democracy are seen as the key to addressing security threats over the long term. This approach was developed at a ministerial workshop in Windhoek, Namibia, during July 1994, in which mechanisms to ensure human rights, arms control and disarmament, and conflict resolution were\n\ndiscussed (SADC, 1994). However, the organisation has now settled on a far less elaborate structure. While it has the benefits of flexibility, it has been criticised by a number of South African non-governmental organisations for failing to institutionalise mechanisms for dealing with human rights violations.\n\nDespite its commitment to a new approach, it is likely that the SADC will fall into the habits of most regional organisations which have sought to combine security functions with development – to concentrate on state (or regime) security rather than human security. There is clearly a tension between a commitment to disarmament and a non-military approach to security, and a simultaneous commitment to developing capacity for mutual defence and peacekeeping. It remains to be seen how the SADC will manage this tension and in which way it will evolve.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the absence of an external threat, South Africa’s security will rest primarily on meeting the needs of the population. This should imply a continual move away from investment in defence. Nevertheless, most South Africans would argue that at least some defence capability should be retained, given domestic and regional requirements. Achieving the optimum balance between expenditure aimed at meeting the wider needs of human security, and expenditure on defence and policing to provide the stability needed for development, will not be easy. Much will depend on an informed and transparent assessment of options and the consolidation of democratic processes.\n\nIn May 1996, parliament ratified the White Paper on National Defence for the Republic of South Africa. This was the culmination of a yearlong process of consulting parliamentary defence committees, political parties and civil society interest groups with the view to ‘forging a national consensus on defence matters’ (preface to the Draft White Paper on National Defence, 21 June 1995).\n\nThe White Paper covers the following topics: the transformation of defence policy; civil-military relations; the internal and external strategic environment; regional security; the primary and secondary functions of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF); human resource issues, including integration, demobilisation and affirmative action; budgetary considerations; arms control and the defence industry; and land and the environment.\n\nThe White Paper marks a fundamental break from the aggressive and repressive strategies of the National Party government over several decades. It seeks to bring defence policy into line with the new democratic dispensation, Bill of Rights and strategic environment in South Africa, and with international law on armed conflict. It also seeks to reverse the high level of state militarisation which characterised the apartheid era.\n\nMilitarisation and demilitarisation can be measured by the size, and the increase or decrease over time, of a country’s armed forces, defence budget and weapons holdings. Yet these quantitative factors are, at least in part, a logical consequence of the extent to which that country is engaged in internal and external conflict. They may reflect, but they do not describe or explain, the degree to which government relies on force to solve problems and manage conflict.\n\nMilitarisation and demilitarisation can also be assessed in terms of political and social processes, relationships and values (Cock, 1989). For example, Andreski identifies the following phenomena as indicators of militarism:\n\nFirst, . . . an aggressive foreign policy, based on a readiness to resort to war; second, the preponderance of the military in the state, the extreme case being that of military rule; third, subservience of the whole society to the needs of the army which may involve a recasting of social life in accordance with the pattern of military organisation; and fourth, an ideology which promotes military ideas (cited in Cock, 1989:3).\n\nThese issues are examined below, at the level of national policy and the state, by comparing the previous government’s approach to security and defence with the positions adopted in the White Paper. Five themes of the White Paper are considered: transformation; national security policy; regional security; defence posture and functions; and civil-military relations.\n\nThe chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the relationship between defence policy and practice. It is argued that substantial progress has been made towards state demilitarisation, but that significant exceptions exist in a number of areas, most notably that of arms exports.\n\nTransformation\n\nThe overarching theme of the White Paper is the transformation of defence policy and the SANDF. This imperative arises from four sets of factors: the history of the South African Defence Force (SADF) as an instrument of repression under apartheid; the advent of democracy and the adoption of a Constitution which enshrines fundamental rights; the new strategic environment after the ending of minority rule and the Cold War; and government’s commitment to alleviating poverty and socio-economic inequality.\n\nThe White Paper presents the following ‘principles of defence in a democracy’ as the framework for transformation.\n\nNational security shall be sought primarily through efforts to meet the political, economic, social and cultural rights and needs of South Africa’s people, and through efforts to promote and maintain regional security.\n\nSouth Africa shall pursue peaceful relations with other states. It will seek a high level of political, economic and military co-operation with southern African states in particular.\n\nSouth Africa shall adhere to international law on armed conflict and to all international treaties to which it is party.\n\nThe SANDF shall have a primarily defensive orientation and posture.\n\nSouth Africa is committed to the international goals of arms control\n\nand disarmament. It shall participate in, and seek to strengthen,\n\ninternational and regional efforts to contain and prevent the proliferation of small arms, conventional armaments and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSouth Africa’s force levels, armaments and military expenditure shall be determined by defence policy which derives from an analysis of the external and internal security environment, which takes account of the social and economic imperatives of the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), and which is approved by parliament.\n\nThe SANDF shall be a balanced, modern, affordable and technologically advanced military force, capable of executing its tasks effectively and efficiently.\n\nThe functions and responsibilities of the SANDF shall be determined by the Constitution and the Defence Act.\n\nThe primary role of the SANDF shall be to defend South Africa against external military aggression. Deployment in an internal policing capacity shall be limited to exceptional circumstances and subject to parliamentary approval and safeguards.\n\nThe SANDF shall be subordinate and fully accountable to parliament and the executive.\n\nThe SANDF shall operate strictly within the parameters of the Constitution, domestic legislation and international humanitarian law. It shall respect human rights and the democratic political process.\n\nDefence policy and military activities shall be sufficiently transparent to ensure meaningful parliamentary and public scrutiny and debate, in so far as this does not endanger the lives of military personnel or jeopardise the success of military operations.\n\nThe SANDF shall not further or prejudice party political interests.\n\nThe SANDF shall develop a non-racial, non-sexist and non-discriminatory institutional culture as required by the Constitution.\n\nThe composition of the SANDF shall broadly reflect the composition of South Africa. To this end, affirmative action and equal opportunity programmes will be introduced.\n\nThe SANDF shall respect the rights and dignity of its members within the normal constraints of military discipline and training. (Department of Defence, 1996:2(11.1-11.16))\n\nThe transformation agenda is radical in its content and orientation. Most of the principles listed above stand in direct contrast to military policy and practice under the previous government. The agenda is also radical in its scope. The implementation of these principles requires a fundamental reorientation of defence posture, doctrine and operations; military training, education and institutional culture; defence expenditure, procurement and exports; civil-military relations; and human resource policy.\n\nSADF troops in the townships during the 1980s (Photo by Guy Adams)\n\nMany of the principles are explicitly anti-militarist. The only suggestion of a contrary tendency is the reference to the SANDF as ‘a technologically advanced military force’. This phrase was included in the interim Constitution of 1993 at the insistence of the SADF. It was dropped from the final Constitution of 1996 and replaced in defence policy documents by the term ‘technologically appropriate’.\n\nNational security policy\n\nThe foremost goal of security policy under apartheid was to defend the racially exclusive state and maintain the system of minority rule. The principal strategy was repression through military and paramilitary means. While the liberation movements and internal anti-\n\napartheid groups were regarded as the major threats to security, the targets of state violence included large sections of the civilian population in South Africa, Namibia and Angola (Cock & Nathan, 1989; Cawthra, 1986).\n\nElsewhere in the world, security policy was shaped largely by the conditions of the Cold War. For close on four decades the international system was characterised by acute tension between rival ideological blocs and the prospect of another major war in Europe; in this context, the debate around security focused on states and military stability (Booth, 1994). The primary response to perceived insecurity was the threat of force in the North and the use of force in many regions of the South.\n\nIn contrast to the above, the White Paper emphasises the security of people and the non-military dimensions of security:\n\nIn the new South Africa national security is no longer viewed as a predominantly military and police problem. It has been broadened to incorporate political, economic, social and environmental matters. At the heart of this new approach is a paramount concern with the security of people.\n\nSecurity is an all-encompassing condition in which individual citizens live in freedom, peace and safety; participate fully in the process of governance; enjoy the protection of fundamental rights; have access to resources and the basic necessities of life; and inhabit an environment which is not detrimental to their health and well-being.\n\nAt national level the objectives of security policy therefore encompass the consolidation of democracy; the achievement of social justice, economic development and a safe environment; and a substantial reduction in the level of crime, violence and political instability . . . (Department of Defence, 1996:3(1-3)).\n\nTwo critical assumptions underlie this holistic perspective. First, state security is not necessarily synonymous with the security of people; in much of the world the main threat to citizens is their own government (Thomas, 1991). Second, non-military problems like poverty, oppression and environmental degradation present grave threats to the security of people; if these problems are inadequately addressed, they may lead to violent conflict and threaten the security of the state (Booth, 1994; Buzan, 1991; Kampala Document, 1991).\n\nThe new approach to security bears a superficial resemblance to the apartheid doctrine of Total Strategy, which similarly stressed the political, social and economic dimensions of security (Swilling & Phillips, 1989). In substance, however, the two models are diametrically opposed. The apartheid model sought to militarise all aspects of national policy, while the new approach seeks to demilitarise the\n\nconcept of security.\n\nThis distinction has significant implications for strategy and the distribution of state resources. The White Paper argues that the greatest threats to the South African people are underdevelopment, various socio-economic problems and violent crime, rather than the prospect of external aggression. Accordingly, one of government’s policy priorities is the RDP (Department of Defence, 1996:2(5-6)).\n\nThe RDP is the principal long-term means of promoting the well-being and security of citizens and, thereby, the stability of the country. There is consequently a compelling need to reallocate state resources to the RDP. The challenge is to rationalise the SANDF and contain military spending without undermining the country’s core defence capability in the short- or long-term . . . (2(6-7)).\n\nThe White Paper states explicitly that the new approach to security does not imply an expanded role for the armed forces. Although the SANDF may be employed in a range of secondary tasks, its primary function is defence against external aggression (2(8)).\n\nThe SANDF therefore remains an important security instrument of last resort but it is no longer the dominant security institution. The responsibility for ensuring the security of South Africa’s people is now shared by many government departments and ultimately vests in Parliament (2(9)).\n\nIn summary, the White Paper adopts a broad approach to security and a narrow approach to defence. The combined effect is to downgrade the status of the armed forces in the state’s definition of security, formulation of strategy and allocation of funds. Whereas previously ‘security’ had virtually the same meaning as ‘defence’, the latter is now seen as a discrete subset of the former.\n\nRegional security\n\nFrom the late 1970s, Pretoria’s regional policy was predicated on, and exacerbated, antagonistic relations with most neighbouring states. These states were subjected to an intense programme of destabilisation, leading to thousands of deaths, massive economic destruction, a regional arms race and a greater resolve by the international community to end apartheid. The net result was perpetual insecurity for the states and people of South and southern Africa (Hanlon, 1986).\n\nThe destabilisation campaign was not solely a product of apartheid. It also reflected, at a deeper conceptual level, the Cold War perspective that international relations are inescapably conflictual. In\n\nMozambican refugees arriving in South Africa in 1987 (Photo by Walter Dhladhla)\n\nearly 1994, as political tensions in southern Africa began to thaw, SADF officers continued to argue that ‘states do not have allies, they only have interests’ and that ‘the international system is based on the law of the jungle’ (author’s interview with SADF officers, Pretoria, March 1994).\n\nThe Palme Commission reports on disarmament and security issues provide compelling motivation for an alternative, non-adversarial model of ‘common security’. The commission stressed that countries have become increasingly interdependent in the modern technological age, and that common problems transcend national borders as never before. States can no longer protect their citizens through unilateral military means. They share an interest in joint survival and should begin to organise their security policies in co-operation with each other (Palme Commission, 1984, 1989).\n\nCommon security is not based on idealistic assumptions about the international system. It does not deny that inter-state relations are characterised by competing interests and the risk of armed hostilities. Rather, by emphasising the interdependence of states and the potential for military and political co-operation, it seeks to manage such competition and risk without resorting to the use or threat of force.\n\nWith the ending of apartheid and the Cold War, the South African government has embraced this perspective.\n\nFor political, strategic and geographic reasons, defence co-operation with other Southern African states is a priority. South Africa\n\nwill seek to strengthen the security and defence forums of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n\nFollowing trends in other parts of the world, South Africa will encourage the development of a multilateral ‘common security’ approach in Southern Africa. In essence, the SADC states should shape their political, security and defence policies in co-operation with each other . . . (Department of Defence, 1996:4(6.4; 12)).\n\nThe White Paper argues that this approach is essential for three reasons. First, many of the domestic threats to the SADC countries are shared problems and impact negatively on the stability of their neighbours. Second, it is possible that inter-state disputes could emerge over refugees, trade, natural resources and previously suppressed territorial claims. Third, since the subcontinent is politically volatile and its national and regional institutions are relatively weak, internal conflicts could give rise to cross-border tensions (4(13-15)).\n\nCommon security arrangements would have many advantages in this context. They could facilitate defence co-operation, the sharing of resources and intelligence, and the early warning of potential crises; resolve inter-state conflict by peaceful means; co-ordinate peace support operations; negotiate security agreements; and implement confidence- and security-building measures which provide for greater transparency in military matters in order to promote regional confidence and stability (4(16-25)).\n\nWhile the White Paper naturally focuses on the military dimensions of common security, it insists that defence co-operation is not the central vehicle for tackling the security problems afflicting the region.\n\nRegional instability and underdevelopment can only be addressed meaningfully through political reform, socio-economic development and inter-state co-operation in these spheres. Similarly, the prevention and management of inter- and intra-state conflict are primarily a political and not a military matter.\n\n. . . Domestic peace and stability will not be achieved in a context of regional instability and poverty. It is therefore in South Africa’s long-term security interests to pursue mutually beneficial relations with other SADC states and to promote reconstruction and development throughout the region (4(11; 29)).\n\nOver the past five years, aggregate force levels, weapons holdings and defence spending in southern Africa have declined (International Institute for Strategic Studies, 1996:311). The White Paper assumes that further cutbacks are desirable and possible through the conclusion of multilateral treaties on disarmament and conventional arms control (Department of Defence, 1996: 4(26)).\n\nThe White Paper acknowledges that South Africa has a particular\n\nresponsibility in this regard because of ‘its relative military strength on the subcontinent’. Lower force levels and weapons holdings ‘might stimulate a broader process of disarmament in Southern Africa’, and ‘the adoption of a defensive and non-threatening posture would contribute to building confidence and positive relationships’ (4(27-8)).\n\nDefence posture and functions\n\nAs noted earlier, from the late 1970s South Africa’s foreign posture and military doctrine became increasingly offensive.
