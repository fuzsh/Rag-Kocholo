Dysphoria, Lassitude, and Panic are all subscales of the IDAS-II representing severe negative affects with different levels of activation (energy) involved. These states are baseline personality trait measures that represent the general proclivity an individual has towards being in a state of negative emotion. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment, the current study aims to highlight the specific impacts of unique negative affect as a means of predicting CRPBs and identify the way that individual unique affective states impact behavior rather than the generic label of \"negative affectivity\" as a personality trait. Using two separate samples from larger studies on undergraduate students from a large university in California, this study aims to produce an ecologically valid model of the temporal dynamics at play to identify the damaging properties of specific negative affects.\n\nInvestigating the Bidirectional Relationship Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Sleep Homeostasis in D. Melanogaster\n\nStudent: Rebecca Ray\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Rebecca Delventhal\n\nAbstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs when a sudden, severe impact to the head causes brain damage. This can impact short- and long-term health and homeostatic behaviors, like sleep. Recent studies have established D. melanogaster as a model for TBI that displays many characteristics of TBI in humans. Since sleep is a conserved behavior in nearly all animals, we decided to investigate the relationship between TBI and sleep using D. melanogaster. To test how TBI affects sleep over time, we used the High-Impact Trauma (HIT) device to injure wild-type flies and measured their sleep in the days and weeks post-injury. We found that at 48 hrs and 1 wk post-TBI, injured flies had more fragmented sleep than uninjured controls but progressed to sleeping more at 2 and 4 weeks. We then asked if disrupting sleep via a genetically short-sleeping fly had a detrimental effect on TBI recovery. We found that injured short-sleeping flies had a significantly higher acute mortality than injured flies with normal sleep, suggesting sleep has a protective effect on TBI recovery. We next asked what the underlying mechanism of this bidirectional relationship between TBI and sleep might be. Prior research supports the theory that sleep helps clear reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting against oxidative stress. To investigate whether ROS mediates the relationship between sleep and TBI, we manipulated the neuronal expression of the antioxidant SOD2 in order to change neuronal ROS levels and measured both short- and long-term TBI recovery. SOD2 knockdown in neurons had no effect on acute mortality or lifespan within injury conditions. Interestingly, injured flies with SOD2 overexpression in neurons had significantly higher acute mortality than injured flies with normal SOD2 expression. Injured and uninjured flies with SOD2 neuronal overexpression also had a decreased lifespan compared to controls with normal SOD2 levels. This poses new questions as to how neuronal antioxidant expression affects ROS levels and oxidative stress throughout the body and if successful TBI recovery requires clearance of ROS in other tissues besides neurons. Future research manipulating ROS levels ubiquitously and in other cell types could further our understanding of ROS’s role in the relationship between TBI and sleep, which could have implications in new TBI prevention or recovery strategies.\n\nPersonality, Parenting, and Romantic Attachment\n\nStudent: Zuzana Smilnakova\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Vivian Ta-Johnson\n\nAbstract: Previous research has shown a link between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and attachment styles in adult romantic relationships. However, it remains unclear how gender and age moderate these links despite the negative association between age and narcissism and the under-representation of women in narcissism research. In addition, no study has examined the role of parenting styles on the link between narcissism and attachment styles even though evidence suggests that attachment styles are partially influenced by parenting styles. I sought to address these limitations in the current study. 97 participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk where they completed a survey that assessed self-reported levels of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, attachment styles, and parenting styles. The results not only highlight the topic of replicability, but also inform the complex relationship between narcissism, attachment styles, and parenting styles. Recommendations for future research will also be discussed.\n\nLinguistic Markers of the Dark Triad: A Systematic Review\n\nStudent: Amelie Motzer\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Vivian Ta-Johnson\n\nAbstract: Although studies have examined the linguistic markers of the Dark Triad (Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy), no systematic review of this body of literature has been conducted to better understand the nature of this relationship. As such, the aim of this present research is to conduct a systematic review of the association between Dark Triad traits and word use. To ensure coverage, several major databases were searched, and seventeen articles were identified after applying exclusion criteria. Our review revealed a consistent link between Narcissism and the usage of words pertaining to friends, social interaction, and self-image. Psychopathy was most consistently linked with the usage of anger words, swear words, negative emotion words, and words referring to basic needs—particularly money. Machiavellianism was least consistently related to any linguistic markers. Our review also highlights methodological inconsistencies across this body of literature that may impact the field’s understanding of how the Dark Triad reveals itself through language. As such, we provide recommendations for future research to enable more reliable and robust examinations of the linguistic markers of Dark Triad traits.\n\nOvercoming Financial Shocks: Is Resilience and Emotional Intelligence the Answer?\n\nStudents: Anele Thomas Mayiga, Ava Pulaski, Caprice Kalvelage, Jia Zheng, Mariam Hovhannisyan, and Nathan Barnes\n\nFaculty Sponsors: Dimitra Papadovasilaki and Ying Wu\n\nAbstract: Financial risk-taking is pivotal for wealth building that may result in increasing one’s financial well-being. Several studies have examined the effect of cognitive variables on financial risk-taking. However, there are very few studies on the relationship between financial risk-taking and non-cognitive variables. This study explores the interplay between emotional intelligence (EI), resilience, and financial risk-taking within Taiwan's cultural context. Analyzing data from 203 participants collected in Taiwan, our findings indicate a positive association between EI and risk-taking, emphasizing the role of emotional acumen in investment decisions. Furthermore, resilience is also positively correlated with taking more financial risks. Birth-assigned gender dynamics reveal an unexpected result, namely that females in Taiwan are more likely to take financial risks. This is the first study that examines the relationship between resilience and financial risk-taking, and one of the few examining the relationship between EI and financial risk-taking. Our research provides valuable insights into the intricate relationships influencing financial behaviors in a specific cultural setting, paving the way for future studies and practical applications in finance.\n\nLillard 244\n\nFaculty Moderator: Roshni Patel\n\nStudent Moderator: Peter Liphardt\n\nPanel 10 livestream »\n\nIs Empathy a Trait Only Humans Possess? An Inquiry with Philip K. Dick\n\nStudent: Olivia Connolly\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Christine Walker\n\nAbstract: Philip K. Dick's exploration of themes like technology's impact, paranoia, and humanity's essence in \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" delves into the blurred lines between reality and illusion. Influenced by figures like Carl Jung and René Descartes and concepts like transhumanism and posthumanism, Dick examines the subjective nature of reality and metaphysical concepts. The novel questions what it means to be authentically human, delving into empathy's role, the forfeiture of humanity through a lack of it, and the complexities of transhumanism. Dick's perspective, as expressed in 'The Android and the Human,' suggests robots may already possess human traits unintentionally. Through empathy tests in the book, such as the Voigt-Kampff scale, Dick distinguishes between humans and androids based on empathetic responses, highlighting the significance of empathy in defining humanity. In a different lens, the project would delve into characters' interactions, like Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen, showcasing the conditional nature and limitations of empathy. It also explores love's manifestation as empathy, exemplified in Deckard's feelings for Rachael and Roy Baty's love for his wife Irmgard. The significance of animals and Edvard Munch's art as tools to evoke empathy in the story contrasts with the treatment of androids, emphasizing empathy's selective nature. Lastly, it underscores how empathy is a learned quality, illustrated through Deckard's evolving empathy towards androids, reshaping his understanding of what it means to be human.\n\nLeaves of Grass and the Lesbian Ghost: Where Walt Whitman Went Wrong\n\nStudent: Paige Blackburn\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Benjamin Goluboff\n\nAbstract: This paper focuses on transcendentalist writer and queer man Walt Whitman and his pro-gay work, Leaves of Grass. Though the piece could be considered progressive for its time, it can be argued that Leaves of Grass actually acts as a hypocritical text today. Because it excludes accurate perspectives of non-male & queer identities (other than male-male homosexuality), the work defies its own purpose as an inclusionary manifesto.\n\nGod: a Re-Presentation\n\nStudent: Sam Bickersteth\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Roshni Patel\n\nAbstract: In this presentation, I intend to briefly survey and dispel various misapprehensions regarding the nature of God. I will begin by highlighting and rejecting the assumption that God is in any way a \"being\" of his own sort, let alone the oft-levelled caricature of \"a man in the sky.\" Navigating recent and popular atheistic critiques of religion, I will emphasise that religious traditions such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, and more all advocate for a God who is not a being amongst beings, but Being or Reality itself. Drawing on the writing of theologian David Bentley Hart, I will point out that the \"god\" critiqued by such atheists is far more akin to the Neoplatonic notion of the demiurge, which is nothing more than a discrete creative force within reality, rather than the Creator God in whom all has its origin. Therefore, the preponderance of contemporary atheistic critiques of religion simply have no purchase on actual theology. On this basis, I will “re-present” the God of religious tradition in such a way as to address qualms that may be offered by the agnostic or sceptic. I will do so by elucidating the futility and recency of fundamentalism, rejecting sharp divisions between religious and secular spheres, and arguing in favour of a natural theology which shows that all people, irrespective of individual belief, naturally “know” God by merit of their existence alone.\n\n“Not Every Girl is Into Dead Guys\": How Buffy Grew into her Power Through her Vampire-Human Romantic Relationships\n\nStudent: Robin Rudolph Woitesek\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Linda Horwitz\n\nAbstract: This project analyzes the cult television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer through applying radical feminist theory, queer theory, and television criticism to examine the romantic relationships that Buffy Summers, the title character, has with vampires Angel and Spike. The examination of the show will initially prove how the series’ groundbreaking queer representation went beyond one of televisions’ first lesbian relationships, and in fact, can be seen in Buffy’s own vampire-human romantic relationships. Analyzing the two relationships through those theoretical frameworks shows how Buffy’s romantic relationships are inherently queer because of the sexuality and gender roles that are being presented. As such, the show is actively restructuring how heterosexual, cisgendered, romantic relationships are supposed to be which allows for consciousness-raising. Furthermore, through comparing the two vampire-human romantic relationships that Buffy goes through, it becomes clear how Buffy’s journey of self-actualization encompasses what she learns from each relationship. The intersections within Buffy’s relationships with both Angel and Spike not only positively portray feminist queer ideals, but show Buffy’s growth both within and outside of those relationships which lead her to self-actualize herself as the Slayer, a role that she previously felt was forced upon her. This makes Buffy’s journey throughout the seven seasons of the show not only about her growing from a rebellious teenager to a confident young adult, but more importantly, about accepting the responsibilities of her vocation as a slayer. This vocation pushes Buffy to be the best form of herself through embodying the queer feminist ideals that the show not only endorses, but actively encourages through Buffy’s own journey.\n\nA for Ambiguity: Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter\n\nStudent: Brenna Burr\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Benjamin Goluboff\n\nAbstract: Nathaniel Hawthorne’s use of symbolism in his allegories, The Scarlet Letter and “Young Goodman Brown,” subverts the structure of allegory through his expert ability to first establish his own meaning in his works and then shift that meaning to represent many different things. In tracking the journey of symbols in Hawthorne’s work, one can see that Hawthorne begins by carefully guiding readers to an intentional and obvious meaning to be derived from his symbols, such as the eponymous scarlet letter, which first represents Hester’s sin. Hawthorne then disrupts this meaning, introducing a different, often opposing meaning, such as when the scarlet letter comes to represent Hester’s benevolence. The same pattern happens with Hawthorne’s other symbols, Pearl in The Scarlet Letter, and the forest, Faith, and Faith’s pink ribbons in “Young Goodman Brown.” Hawthorne’s ability to subvert his own established symbolic meanings not only disrupts the traditional structure of allegory, it also requires the reader to bring their own meaning to a text, creating Hawthorne’s signature ambiguity.\n\nRepeated Restraint Stress Induces Sex-dependent Activation of BNST and Anxiety-like Behavior\n\nStudents: Rose Jasmin Montes\n\nFaculty Sponsor: J. Amiel Rosenkranz\n\nAnxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed. This suggests underlying sex differences in the neural circuitry may contribute to the prevalence of anxiety disorders in females. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is sexually dimorphic, stress-sensitive, and activated during anticipatory anxiety or anticipation of a threat. Prior studies show that female rodents extinguish conditioned freezing to anticipatory anxiety faster than males. However, the extent to which stress modulates anticipatory anxiety in parallel with BNST activation is unknown. Since females are more sensitive to stress, we hypothesized that social interaction would facilitate greater BNST activation in stressed females compared to stressed males and control animals. To test our hypothesis, we used male and female rats exposed social interaction (for 10 minutes) with naïve rats and then to repeated restraint stress (20 min/day for 7 out of 9 days) or control handling. Following treatment, rats underwent another round of social interaction (with naïve rats and for 10 minutes) Afterwards, we immunostained the BNST for c-Fos expression. There was no difference in time spent interacting in the first day of the social interaction. We found significant interactions between sex in that males displayed more avoidance before than females. Preliminary data further suggests that these stress-induced sex differences on anxiety-like behaviors may be related to c-Fos expression in the BNST. We found increased expression in the BNST of stressed rats compared to controls. We also found that they were more prominent in female rats. Together, these studies show how stress influences anxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent fashion, possibly through differences in activation of the BNST.\n\nHaptic Feedback Enhanced Mobility (‘White’) Cane Increases Environmental Awareness in the Absence of Vision\n\nStudents: Suma Pasupulati\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Frederick Prete\n\nApproximately 23 million people who are blind or visually impaired (B/VI) use mobility canes. Although effective, canes cannot detect obstacles beyond the reach of their tip. We explored the possibility of increasing cane effectiveness by incorporating tip-mounted distance sensors that triggered haptic (vibratory) feedback in the cane’s handle when nearby objects were detected. Experiment 1 compared the accuracy of ultrasonic and infrared distance sensors by sweeping canes toward and away from a stationary obstacle at four frequencies (40, 50, 60, 70 sweeps/ min). Sensors were most accurate at 40 and 60 sweeps/min which is consistent with cane sweep rates (one sweep/ step) for B/VI users. Optic infrared sensors were more accurate than ultrasonic but were more susceptible to ambient (light) interference. Experiment 2 compared three cane configurations in an obstacle-avoidance task. Canes differed in tip type (roller ball vs. stationary), haptic stimuli (short vs. long, high vs. low frequency), and object sensing range (max=12, 18, 20 inches). Blindfolded volunteers (N=8) tested each configuration by walking back and forth across a room (8 total trips, approx. 40 feet/trip) between two rows of boxes using haptic feedback on alternate trips. We scored the number of box locations detected without touching (identify), prior to touching (bump), or after inadvertently touching (collision). Volunteers identified significantly more boxes and had fewer collisions with haptic feedback. They also preferred canes with roller tips, short duration/low amplitude stimuli, and feedback beginning within 18 inches of potential obstacles.\n\nGreen Hydroxylation of Aryl Halides in Aqueous Solvent Under Air\n\nStudents: Alana Garcevic and Diana Rosiles-Dueñas\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Erica Schultz\n\nIn many syntheses of phenol derivatives from aryl halides, environmentally toxic solvents and reagents are used. To reduce environmental toll, greener solvents were explored. We found 10% aqueous polyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG-2000) solution works well. PEG-2000 is biodegradable and assists the dissolution of the reagents. Use of this solvent with a Pd-catalyst, sodium hydroxide, and halogenated benzene derivates (Cl, Br, and I) gives the corresponding phenol. This reaction can be performed under an atmosphere of air while maintaining good conversion. In the presence of air and the reaction conditions, benzyl alcohol substrates undergo a two-step, one-pot oxidation hydroxylation reaction to form benzaldehyde or acetophenone derivatives.\n\nOn The Visualization of Binary Stellar Evolution for POSYDON\n\nStudents: Dean Kousiounelos\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Dr. Vicky Kalogera, Dr. Seth Gossage, Northwestern CIERA\n\nWe present BinaryStory, an open-source visualization tool for stellar binary evolution data. BinaryStory directly integrates with data, a departure from the conventional post-data processing practices for creating illustration graphics. It generates van den Heuvel diagrams based on output data from Binary Population Synthesis Code, POSYDON. BinaryStory creates a visual profile of the stellar evolution chain, supporting visual analysis of binary stellar models. Leveraging a mixture of illustrative and computational methods, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of their data while enhancing scientific communication and outreach.\n\nFitness Effects of Alternative Reproductive Strategies in Female Bean Beetles\n\nStudents: Katina Lucas and Lia Romanotto\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Flavia Barbosa\n\nTrade-offs are a central concept to life-history theory, arising due to differential trait investment within an organism and resulting in negative covariances between traits. The bean beetle Callosobruchus maculatus provides an outstanding model species for the study of trade-offs, since larval density is known to induce differential resource allocation in this species. Low density results in short-winged flightless morphs. High density results in morphs with large, functional wings and early-life egg production in females. Here we investigated how different female oviposition strategies affect fitness, testing the hypothesis that females developing under high density invest more in current reproduction as an adaptive “live fast” life-history strategy that emerges in response to high density levels. We employed density manipulations in the egg and larval stages and measured the effects of density in different female reproductive traits at different time points of the adult stage.\n\nIdentification of Genes that Increase Expression of YHC3, a Yeast Homolog to CLN3, the Gene Defective in Batten Disease\n\nStudents: Kotryna Andriuškevičiūtė\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Shubhik DebBurman\n\nBatten disease is an autosomal progressive neuropediatric disease caused by mutation in the human CLN3 gene. The disease is characterized by vision loss, cognitive impairment, motor impairment, and epilepsy, and it currently has no cure. The role of CLN3 is unknown. Our study aimed to identify genes that increase expression of YHC3 gene, a yeast homolog to human CLN3. This identification would, in turn, help us identify the conditions that induce the expression, giving us insight into the role of the gene product. The experiment utilized a yeast strain in which the ORF for YHC3 was replaced with the HIS3 gene using CRISPR. This strain allowed selection of strains for the expression at the YHC3 locus by growth on media containing 3-aminotriazole, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product. The experiment identified potential candidate genes that increase expression at the YHC3 locus, including RPL40, TOD6, and many more.\n\nInsight into Synucleinopathies: Molecular Dissection of β- and γ-Synuclein for Potential Toxicity in a Yeast Model\n\nStudents: Federica Bertolotti, Holly Kiernan, and Leslie Casares\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Shubhik DebBurman\n\nSynucleinopathies are linked to the misfolding and accumulation of the synuclein proteins (αS, βS, and γS) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. While α-synuclein is well-studied for its direct contribution to PD, less is known about the role in neurodegeneration of βS and γS. Two βS mutants (P123H and V70M) were recently linked with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and recently, γS inclusions were reported observed in ALS patients. Lessons from αS toxicity demonstrate that it is not only enhanced by mutations within it but modified by different molecule modifications. Here, we further evaluated the toxicity potential of βS and γS by characterizing swap mutants by using the known mutations in αS and βS onto each other and γS, using our budding yeast PD model system. Additionally, we evaluated substitution mutants βS, to evaluate what drives the toxicity. Finally, we mutated known sites to be altered by molecules in αS and βS to assess their toxicities. We report that: (1) V70M and P123H βS mutants aggregate and are more toxic than WT βS, (2) βS substitution mutants demonstrate that gain of histidine is key to P123H βS toxicity, and (3) the V70M βS mutation when swapped into αS makes the latter more toxic than swapping the P123H. Overall, this study expands the evaluation of βS and γS to understand mechanisms of toxicity for these two nervous system proteins and illuminates mutant toxicity in βS.\n\nSocial Instability Decreases Social Interaction and Reduces Amygdala GABAergic Activity\n\nStudents: Danielle Selby\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Shubhik DebBurman\n\nStable social structures are an important component of the social environment that regulate social behavior. Social instability disrupts social structure through the repeated rotation of cagemates in the home setting. This unique approach allows for the study of how social structure impacts affective behavior. In rats, social instability (repeated cagemate rotations within the homecage) disrupts social behavior and the function of several brain regions. This study investigated how brief social instability affects social and nonsocial exploration and cellular activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basal amygdala (BA), two brain regions involved in social processing and emotional regulation. We found that rats exposed to social instability exhibited decreased social interaction and altered non-reciprocated (social avoidance-like) behaviors compared to rats in stable social conditions. However, non-social exploration behaviors remained unaffected by social instability. Brain tissue was then processed to quantify changes in cellular activity, using zif268 as a proxy, within the mPFC and BA. Within the BA, social instability reduced GABAergic activity (GAD67-zif268 colocalization). Within the mPFC, we found that social instability modestly reduced activity. Furthermore, we found that activity in the infralimbic cortex region of the mPFC was related to BA GABAergic activity and social behavior such that greater infralimbic cortex activity results in greater GABAergic activity and social interaction. Together, these results demonstrate that social instability reduces social engagement and prefrontal cortical activity that subsequently reduces BA GABAergic activation.\n\nInsight into Synucleinopathies: Comparative Evaluation of α-, β-, and 𝛄-Synucleins in a Yeast Model\n\nStudents: Sebastian Gacek, Leslie Casares, Federica Bertolotti, and Isaiah J. Moonlight\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Shubhik DebBurman\n\nSynucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders linked with the misfolding and aggregation of ⍺-synuclein, the most well-known among them being Parkinson’s disease (PD). ⍺-Synuclein belongs to a larger family of proteins that include β- and 𝛾-synuclein. Mutant forms (P123H and V70M) of β-synuclein have been shown to cause Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). However, the extent to which β- and 𝛾-synuclein are neurotoxic is still highly understudied. While specific alterations in cellular environments and post-translational modifications alter the toxicity and aggregation of α-synuclein, less is known of their impacts on β- and 𝛾-synuclein. Here, we used our lab’s budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) model to comparatively evaluate these three synucleins (including the two β-mutants) and explore their pathological potential through the assessment of toxicity, localization, and expression under varying levels of expression. We report a number of findings. (1) Both ⍺- and β-synuclein are differentially toxic but only when expressed at high levels, while 𝛾-synuclein is non-toxic irrespective of expression. (2) Expression levels of these proteins are tied to extent of aggregation and cytotoxicity. One difference between our high and low expression systems is the Kozak DNA sequence within the synuclein genes. Eliminating this DNA difference has minimal effect on protein expression and only slightly contributes to ⍺-synuclein toxicity. (3) All synucleins are more toxic with high nitrative stress, even 𝛾-synuclein. (4) All synucleins are sensitive to altered di/triglycerides. (5) And β-synuclein displays a higher molecular weight than expected. This study adds to a growing body of research exploring disease association of the synuclein family of proteins and illustrates the importance of further evaluation of all synucleins in neurodegeneration.\n\nCircadian Control of Dorsolateral Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNSTDL) via Hypothalamic Vasopressin (AVP) Projections\n\nStudents: Lorena Monroy\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Nora McLean\n\nThe BNST regulates fear and anxiety-like behaviors and receives inputs from hypothalamic nuclei that regulate crucial physiological processes. We previously showed that AVP directly excites STEP neurons in BNSTDL. However, the source of specific peptidergic inputs containing AVP in the BNSTDL are elusive. Hence, we used anterograde tracing and found that the SCN and SON of the hypothalamus send AVP-containing inputs to the BNSTDL. To determine whether the SCN and BNSTDL have synchronous activity, we quantified immunoreactivity patterns for AVP and STEP in the SCN and BNSTDL across four zeitgeber times. We found an inverse pattern of AVP expression in the SCN and STEP expression in the BNST, suggesting synchronous activity. To test whether chemogenetic activation of SCN-AVP neurons or inhibition of BNST-OTR neurons affects fear and anxiety-like behaviors, we used male and female AVP-Cre rats with excitatory DREADDS in the SCN and OTR-Cre rats with inhibitory DREADDS in the BNST. The rats were tested in the EPM and underwent contextual fear conditioning. Activation or inhibition of these neurons generally did not affect defensive behaviors nor contextual fear.\n\nInhibitory Control and Temperament in 3- and 5-year-olds\n\nStudents: Olivia Ramirez, Cecilia Flores, Jia Zheng, and Lucy Freeman\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Naomi Wentworth\n\nThis study investigates the interplay between inhibitory control and temperament in preschool-aged children (3- and 5-year-olds) to enhance our understanding of early developmental dynamics. Inhibitory control, the cognitive ability to regulate impulsive responses, is pivotal for cognitive and socio-emotional development. Temperament embodies the enduring facets of an individual's character, influencing how they react to the world by manifesting biologically rooted patterns of emotional, attentional, and motor responsiveness. Employing a multi-method approach, the investigation implements a flanker task and dinky toys task to assess inhibitory control, and a maternal report to measure temperament. Task order is counterbalanced. The study's overarching objective is to explore the intricate relationship between inhibitory control and temperament in preschool-aged children. It is hypothesized that positive temperament remarks will positively correlate with higher inhibitory control scores (H1) and that developmental differences between 3- and 5-year-olds result in significantly different inhibitory task performances (H2).\n\nChanges in Immune Signaling May Mediate Different Outcomes Between Mild, Repeated TBI and a Single, Severe TBI.\n\nStudents: Jorge A. Garcia\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Rebecca Delventhal\n\nTraumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a common neurological disorder, affecting more than 1.5 million people nationwide and often causing hospitalization, long-term disability, and death. However, due to differences in age, sex, and other demographics, it is difficult to compare outcomes of different injury patterns amongst humans, especially because the characteristics of TBIs sustained are often highly variable. To study head injuries in a controlled manner, we used Drosophila Melanogaster as a model organism to assess the effects of mild, repeated TBI (multi-day, MD) compared to a single, severe TBI (single-day, SD). We wanted to know if different patterns of TBI differ in short- and long-term outcomes. To determine this, we measured acute mortality, lifespan, and climbing. We found that flies given a SD TBI exhibited higher acute mortality, but the surviving flies showed a longer lifespan than flies given a MD TBI. Likewise, flies given a MD TBI showed worse long-term locomotor ability. We hypothesized that different immune responses to MD vs. SD TBI may mediate differences in short- and long-term outcomes. To test this, we measured expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 4 hours post-TBI and found that AMP expression increased after each day of the MD TBI and was eventually equivalent – if not greater – than expression four hours post-SD TBI. We are currently investigating long-term AMP expression post-TBI. We also measured acute mortality and lifespan of Imd and Toll mutant flies post-MD and SD TBI. We found that loss of Imd led to worse short- and long-term survival in both injury conditions, indicating that Imd signaling is protective in both injury types. Interestingly, while loss of Toll led to worse short-term survival after SD TBI, Toll mutants survived better after MD TBI. When we measured Toll mutants’ lifespan post-MD and SD TBI, we saw that loss of Toll did not significantly change the flies’ lifespan post-SD TBI but modestly increased the lifespan of flies post-MD TBI, suggesting that Toll signaling is detrimental for both short- and long-term outcomes from a MD TBI. To understand cell-type specificity in Toll signaling, we are conducting glial and neuronal knockdowns of Toll and testing short- and long-term outcomes. Understanding differences in cellular immune responses to different types of TBI could enable the development of tailored treatments, improving outcomes.\n\nEducation and Architecture: Unveiling the Archaeological Remains of Armour Flats and Armour Mission\n\nStudents: Emma Zagaiski, Ian Cox, Riley Groark, Sofia Vizinho Santana, and Theresa Wilhite\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Rebecca Graff\n\nIn Summer 2023, Lake Forest College students conducted an archaeological excavation at the former site of Armour Flats and Armour Mission in Bronzeville, Chicago. The site, now part of Illinois Tech, was originally established by the Armour brothers, owners of Armour Meatpacking Company. Armour Mission evolved from a non-sectarian church to a settlement house, offering diverse community activities. Armour Flats, initially housing senior employees, later expanded to include faculty and students. Both structures were demolished in the 1960s as part of urban renewal efforts. The exhibition presents artifacts showcasing the site's dynamic history, revealing residential, educational, and architectural uses. The findings contribute to understanding Chicago's urban development, and student participants will engage with visitors, providing insights into the archaeological process. This exhibit serves as a platform for historical insights and educational exchange.\n\nStories of Religion at Lake Forest College\n\nStudents: Daniel Contreras, Emma Zagaiski, Harriet Townsend, Heli Villaseñor Garcia, Isabel Hinojosa, Jessica Caal Chamam, Katherine Mikna, Nickie Figueroa, and Miles Wells\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Ben Zeller\n\nThroughout the semester we identified effective museum practices and techniques which we implemented in this exhibition. The class particularly focused on how religion is presented in museums and inspired us to create our own exhibition about religion. Not only will you see the development of the Religion Department at the College, but also student portraits and stories of their religion and spirituality.\n\nIonothermal Synthesis of New Tin Thiophosphate\n\nStudent: Amy Tram\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Jason Cody\n\nIonic liquids (ILs) are green and renewable solvents that have become more widely used recently due to their low vapor pressure, high ionic conductivity, and high thermal stability. These solvents can replace traditional solvents, such as water and organic solvents, as more environmentally friendly substitutes. This project aims to use ILs as solvents and structure directing agents, building on past successes with Ni, Fe, Co, Mn, and Cr to prepare new thiophosphates with Sn. The two ionic liquids [EMIM][CF3SO3] and [EMIM][BF4] are used with ratios of elemental tin, red phosphorus, and sulfur. The compound [EMIM]2[Sn(P3S9)2] has been synthesized using [EMIM][CF3SO3]. Extensive analyses by IR, DSC, and X-ray diffraction are presented.\n\nThe Olive Branches In Our Veins – A Story of Palestinian Environmental Justice and Resilience\n\n(Short Documentary Screening in Lillard 044)\n\nStudent: Valentina Ferreira Figueroa\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Brian McCammack\n\nThis project explores the intersection of social injustices faced by indigenous Palestinians with environmental concerns, highlighting the link between the Palestinian identity, culture, and their connection to the land. By weaving personal narratives, documented instances of settler abuse, and principles of Environmental Justice, the study delves into the complexities of Palestinian environmental injustices under occupation. It scrutinizes the historical trajectory of Palestine’s occupation, revealing the environmental degradation inflicted upon Palestinian territories while spotlighting Israel's 'greenwashing' tactics. Drawing from the Principles of Environmental Justice and insights from scholars like Kyle Whyte, the project examines how settler colonialism disrupts indigenous relationships with the environment. Through the lens of Palestinian experiences, it elucidates how the uprooting of native vegetation, particularly the symbolic olive trees, and the imposition of non-native flora adversely affect both the environment and Palestinian livelihoods. Ultimately, the project asserts that Israeli settler colonialism not only inflicts social injustices but also engenders environmental degradation, entrenching the erasure of Palestinian identity and culture.\n\nOne Day I'll Be\n\nStudent: Katherine Peticolas\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: Through my poster series, I am seeking to illustrate the disproportionate opportunities in athletics, which perpetuates an unfair system against young girls. At young ages, not only are girls funneled into avenues that diverge from the athletics path, but they also aren’t given the resources, time, and energy when they are pursuing athletics. These early experiences deter them from realizing their potential in and love for athletics. This series endeavors to remove preconceptions and to reintroduce famous athletes as the fearless, determined, and talented children they once were. Each poster features a picture of famous female athletes’ childhoods, with the backdrop of iconic photos from their current professional careers. The pictures allow viewers to see the dreams and aspirations of young athletes long before they became household names and world-renowned athletes. By portraying these female athletes as children, I hope to show that greatness in athletics is not about gender, but about fueling the dreams of young children. This project is a testament to the potential that resides in every child and the crucial role society plays in nurturing or extinguishing that potential.\n\nUntitled (a Current Movement)\n\nStudent: Kara Hennessy\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: Influenced by the transformative philosophy of impressionism, I approach my artistic endeavors with a keen awareness of the fleeting nuances that define our sensory experiences. Much like the impressionist painters who sought to capture the essence of a moment, my work reflects a commitment to distilling the vibrant, ever-changing beauty of Southern California's nature and wildlife. The brushstrokes of impressionism have played a profound role in shaping my perception, guiding me to perceive the world not just as a static tableau, but as a dynamic interplay of light, color, and emotion. My current project, Untitled (a Current Movement), is an homage to my childhood encounters with the ocean – an exploration of its boundless power and the mesmerizing forms that dwell beneath its surface. I aim to infuse this installation with the essence of my nostalgic childhood wonder and deep-seated love for the ocean. Through my art, I strive to create an immersive environment that not only visually stimulates but also resonates emotionally. Inspired by the pursuit of beauty in unexpected places, I seek to reveal the often-overlooked aspects of nature’s grace. In crafting this emotional and visual connection, my goal is to offer viewers a sanctuary for introspection, inspiration, and rediscovery of the profound beauty and harmony inherent in the world. By momentarily detaching from the ordinary, visitors to my installations can immerse themselves in the extraordinary, finding solace and inspiration in the intricate dance of light, form, and emotion that defines the natural world.\n\nEphemeral Threads of Grief: A Visual Exploration\n\nStudent: Satya Mueller\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: In my artistic exploration, I intertwine hyper-realistic painting with dynamic yarn work, aiming to forge a visual language that sparks introspection and deep emotional exploration. My work delves into personal grief, portraying a poignant scene with my dogs. A lifelike rendering of Mona, my beloved dog, contrasts with a blacked-out silhouette of Murphy, emphasizing profound loss. To intensify the emotional narrative, black yarn flows from Murphy's silhouette, adding a tactile dimension to the canvas and eliciting deep emotions related to grief. This work seeks to visually captivate and emotionally resonate, inviting viewers to engage with the universal theme of grief in a compelling manner.\n\n55 McNair Road\n\nStudent: Callie Elms\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: Having moved to Singapore at the age of three, my childhood was marked by a complex and fleeting existence, constantly moving from one rental house to another. The sixth and final residence in this series was 55 McNair Road. It was only supposed to be my home for three months. We moved from 55 Gentle Road to 55 McNair Road on March 7th, 2020 during my senior year of high school. I had been accepted at Lake Forest College and was planning on leaving directly after graduation to stay with family over the summer. I actually lived at 55 McNair Road for a year and a half. It became both my sanctuary and my jail cell during the pandemic. I became extremely attached to the four walls of my bedroom. Leaving 55 McNair Road for 555 N Sheridan Road was like being ripped from everything I had once known and loved. Although I eventually adapted to life in the US, a part of me remains intertwined with the memories of that house. This ceramic piece is a near-perfect copy of 55 McNair Road. Utilizing Google Map's street view feature, supplemented by my parents' photographs and my own memories, I strived to recreate the home exactly. Accompanying the ceramic piece is a digital collage, curated from a blend of my personal photos, my parents' images, and vintage Singaporean paraphernalia. Together, these artworks encapsulate the emotional and aesthetic reverberations of my time at 55 McNair Road.\n\nInside Outside\n\nStudent: Jane Wood\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: This series of paintings, named “Inside Outside”, is an exploration of light, perspective, and the memories they provoke. In the last year, I’ve realized that specific times of day and the lighting that accompanies them conjure different emotions. In the spring, while studying in Athens, I began painting abstract compositions inspired by dusk on the suburban streets, both at home and in Greece. The result was a painting that was both geometric and emotional. I used the angles that were found in corners and windows to create dimensions within the painting, and colors inspired by the sky. “Inside Outside” utilizes those same principles but expands on them. Instead of painting on canvases, I am using found objects. More specifically, old 3’ by 3’ windows with large frames. The windows are over a hundred years old and used to belong to a bungalow. By adding and removing layers of paint to the front and back of the glass and frames, I created three unique compositions. After creating the first two, I realized that their compositions aligned. They share similar specific lines, and both use brilliant orange and blue colors inspired by the outside at golden hour. When being exhibited, I plan on hanging them from the ceiling, one in front of the other. This use of windows and two sequential windows will play with the viewer's ideas of space and color. The third window focuses on interiors and the sharp contrast between manmade light and the night sky. I simulated a smaller window within the composition by adding a box to the back of the frame and adding warm light. Inside Outside offers a place for viewers to reflect on their relationship with light. Each composition offers a look into another world, or an altered version of their own.\n\nDestiny Woven with Spider-Lily Blooms\n\nStudent: Mari Pliego\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: My artwork revolves around crafting narratives that critique societal norms and the impact of social media. Focusing on gender and its roles, particularly femininity versus masculinity, I challenge and blur these constructs through subjective interpretations. Rejecting fixed definitions, I explore what defines gender and its effect on audience perception. In \"Fate,\" I present dual perspectives—one from a woman, the other from a man—employing distinct techniques, colors, and gazes to emphasize gender stereotypes. The subtle variations prompt a reevaluation of conventional norms, compelling the audience to question their perceptions of masculinity and femininity.\n\nThreads of Identity: Mapping the Margins / Hilos de Identidad: Cartografiando los Márgenes\n\nStudent: Kimberly L Casas\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: As a first-generation, Latiné, queer artist and activist in Chicago, my art delves into self-expression, rooted in urban environments and marginalized identities. Extensive research on queer, Latiné, and BIPOC histories guides my creative process, shaping themes and narratives. Using diverse materials and mediums—from block printing to digital illustration—I strive for a multidimensional representation of overlooked stories. My ongoing project combines photography and screen printing on clothing, honoring the artmaking legacy. It highlights the importance of identities in urban spaces, preserving and celebrating marginalized voices. Contributing to the diversity dialogue, my art recognizes the archival power in capturing our shared humanity.\n\nOklushi\n\nStudent: Nenna Rouse\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: I present a suite of paintings – oil on canvas adorned with glass seed beads strung in the traditional Choctaw style. My artistic journey is a celebration of empowerment, with a profound focus on indigenous women, guided by the Choctaw term 'oklushi,' meaning 'female tribe.' The inspiration for my work arises from personal connections with strong female role models who have left an enduring impact on my identity. They have fueled my dedication to honoring the unity, strength, and resilience embodied by indigenous women. A core objective of my art is to raise awareness about the pressing issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit individuals. To authentically address this matter, I have immersed myself in research on registered Choctaw artists and sought guidance from elders to ensure culturally sensitive representation. My art incorporates potent imagery from the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movement, employing native color schemes like the medicine wheel and moving fire to convey a message of unwavering strength and resilience. Through my work, I invite viewers to engage in a journey of awareness, empathy, and tribute, amplifying the voices and honoring the legacy of indigenous women in the pursuit of justice and recognition.\n\nDreams Woven in Sacrifices\n\nStudent: Danna Blancas\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: In this presentation, I portray the arduous journey of undocumented immigrants through four paintings, depicting skeletal figures symbolizing the toll on their physical and emotional well-being. These paintings come together to form a quilt, representing the collective struggles, sweat, tears, fears, and sacrifices of these individuals. The installation includes a hand-built bed for the child of immigrants, a “dreamer,” serving as a sanctuary amid challenges. This project prompts contemplation on immigration's political landscape, challenging societal norms and perceptions. By engaging with the symbolism and tangible elements, I invite the audience to reflect on our collective responsibility to acknowledge, honor, and uplift the sacrifices made by undocumented immigrants in pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nEternal Memories\n\nStudent: Ashlee Clarke\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: This is a body of work about lived experiences, memories both good and bad, personal identity, how the past remains with us in our present, and how we perceive uncomfortable or heavy topics. This work includes interdisciplinary works of art, but all could be considered to be mixed media.\n\nSuspendida Amidst Flourishing Parasites\n\nStudent: Adriana Ree-Jurek\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: This abstract presents an art installation inspired by the personal battle with Endometriosis, aiming to shed light on the condition's complexities. Through a visual narrative, it features two contrasting sculptures connected by a flowing material, symbolizing the internal struggle and resilience of those affected. The installation uses abstract forms and emotional depth to evoke empathy and awareness for Endometriosis, often unseen. By transforming personal experience into a universal dialogue, the artist fosters a deeper understanding and visibility for the condition. This work serves as a powerful medium for discussing health issues, highlighting the strength of those living with Endometriosis and the role of art in societal empathy and awareness.\n\nEsperanza: A New Generation\n\nStudent: Natalie Mercedes Serrano\n\nFaculty Sponsor: Susy Bielak\n\nArtist statement: Esperanza: A New Generation is a multi-media installation that explores migration through the lens of my own family. Coming from a strong matriarchy of seamstresses, crocheters, and weavers, I am furthering these traditions of craft to continue a legacy of work. My family left Colombia between the 1970s and early 2000s due to the economic and political instability, as well as violence. It has taken 28 years for the nucleus of my family to reestablish itself in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. Emigrando Nuestras Flores de Esperanza is a 6-foot-tall crochet piece sewn together in burlap. The burlap sack is reminiscent of exported products, depicting the laborers whose work they exploit. The wooden structure is inspired by “Silletas,” ladder-like wooden carriers used to transport goods, specifically flowers. The Silletas are carried on the backs of campesinos or Silleteros (farmers) for 22 kilometers (about 13.67 mi) from Santa Elena to Medellín. This piece is a collaborative labor between three generations of women. Retratos de Soledad depicts the separation between my family due to migration. The quotes are from 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. Some of the flowers are complete, representing each fourth anniversary of living in the United States. Other flowers remain pending as time continues. \"Si Dios nos da la vida” or God willing, we shall be together once again."
