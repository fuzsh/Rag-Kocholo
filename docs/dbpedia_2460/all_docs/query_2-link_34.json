        "text": "MOBILE, Alabama -- Mobile Police Officer Kenneth Gillespie has been named June's Officer of the Month, officials said today in a news release.\n\nGillespie will be recognized at noon Tuesday during a luncheon at the Knights of Columbus Hall, 3051 Pleasant Valley Road. The program is sponsored by the Optimist Club of Mobile.\n\nGillespie, who has served with the department since 2006, serves as a robbery detective. The following arrests earned Gillespie the distinction:\n\nOn June 2 between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., three separate robberies were reported within a confined area of Mobile. In each case, three armed men approached the victims and demanded property before leaving the scene in a gold sedan, police said.\n\nThrough careful investigation that same night, Gillespie, along with another detective, tracked down the vehicle, detained two of the three robbers and recovered the victims' property. The third suspect was later identified and arrested as well.\n\nDuring the month of June, Detective Gillespie was assigned eight cases with seven being cleared, giving him an 87.5% clearance rate, officials said.\n\n\"Detective Gillespieâ€™s dedication to duty and attention to detail has brought credit upon himself and the Mobile Police Department,\" officials said in a statement."
