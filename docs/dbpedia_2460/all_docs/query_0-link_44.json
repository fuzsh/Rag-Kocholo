Australian defence strategy has historically been on the premise that Australiaâs security is best ensured by the presence of a reliable, established, and powerful ally, which involved sending our defence forces for overseas wars and conflicts (forward defence); and the traditional defence approach to defend the nation's borders and their approaches (Defence of Australia). The author opines that the DSR addresses both concepts.\n\nField Marshal Sir Thomas Albert Blamey: A Career of Challenges, Conquests, and Controversies Part II - Thomas E (Ted) Blamey.\n\nThomas E (Ted) Blamey, the grandson of Field Marshal Thomas Albert Blamey recounts the life and times of his grand father, Australia's only Field Marshal who served in both, World War I and World War II as a wartime Commander.

The Indian Army comprised the 29 Indian Infantry Brigade, 7 Indian Mountain Artillery Brigade with two Mountain Batteries, the Indian Mule Corps, and two Field Ambulances which included a Hospital Ship. Approximately 1600 Indians sacrificed their lives and over 3000 were casualties.\n\nContributed Essay\n\nThe Defence Strategic Review and the importance of the Australian Defence Force Reserve - Michael Annett\n\nAn overview of the submission provided by the Defence Reserves Association (DRA) to the Defence team conducting the Defence Strategic Review (DSR) into Australian Defence Force (ADF) is described in this paper. The DRA has long advocated for a better resourced and more integrated Reserve component to boost ADF capacity, both in current and contingency operational tasks. The effectiveness of the Reserve in recent regional deployments and in domestic disaster relief operations has often been acknowledged and praised, but no one would contend that resourcing of the Reserve or integrated planning for their optimisation has been a priority at the strategic centre in Canberra.\n\nBook Reviews\n\nThe Gathering Storm: Prelude to the Spitfire Summer of 1940 by by Dilip Sarkar - reviewed by Bob Treloar\n\nThe Gathering Storm provides a comprehensive backdrop to the strategic circumstances, political climate, military situation and the miscalculation that resulted in Britain being so ill equipped to defend itself in World War II.

E. Duncan Lewis\n\nAs Australia prepares for life in an uncertain and fractious world there are five key challenges that it faces: great powerivalry; threats to the rules-based world order; the assault on democracy; the vulnerabilities of modernity; and the cost of addressing those challenges. Those of us who are involved in the defence sector must pay great attention to these challenges. We have the job in front of us and there is much work to be done.\n\n2023 Sir Hermann Black Lecture: the year in review - Aaron Patrick\n\nMr Patrick comments on several issues which have had an impact on the global strategic outlook in 2023, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, social division in the United States, and the need for facts to underpin strategic assessments as illustrated by the David McBride Afghan Files affair in Australia. He concludes that 2023 shows us that trade does not guarantee peace; nations always need to be prepared for war; and socially divided nations, like the United States, are more likely to suffer decline. That said, another way to look at 2023 is that it was a turning point for the West, to a time of ascension.\n\nField Marshal Sir Thomas Albert Blamey: A Career of Challenges, Conquests, and Controversies - Thomas E (Ted) Blamey.\n\nThomas E (Ted) Blamey, the grandson of Field Marshal Thomas Albert Blamey recounts the life and times of his grand father, Australiaâs only Field Marshal who served in both, World War I and World War II as a wartime Commander.\n\nContributed Essay\n\nHow did technological advancement in artillery alter soldiers' experiences of the First World War? - Alex Hands\n\n16 This essay investigates the progression of artillery prior to and during the First World War, and examines how soldiers' and nurses' experiences of combat were transformed by the development of artillery. Psychological trauma caused by prolonged artillery bombardments, the cause and cost of attritional warfare, and the devastation of environment are also explained. It highlights the link between technology and the artillery experiences, asserting its ability to transform military doctrine, societal expectations, and responses to adversity.\n\nBook Reviews\n\nF-35: The inside story of the Lightning II - reviewed by Bob Treloar\n\nThe book provides a detailed account of the most expensive and controversial military program in history, on the development of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft. The concept that drove the development of the F-35 Lightning II was on the premise that if all three US services and major allied air forces and navies could operate the same aircraft, global security would be significantly enhanced, and at a lower cost to all concerned. Four authors, together have created an excellent insight into the unique, and often troubled development of what is arguably the most sophisti cated and effective fighter aircraft yet built. Life so full of promise, further biographies of Australia's lost generation - reviewed by Paul Simadas\n\nThis book contains biographies, each a book in its own right, of three Australian men who died on active service in the Great War, two who served as officers and one as a private soldier. It follows on from the authorâs earlier, \"Farewell, Dear People: Bio graphies of Australia's Lost Generation\" that contained ten shorter biographies of Australians in the Great War. The dragon's bite: strategic continuum and Chinese PLA's evolving fire and teeth - reviewed by Joe Matthews\n\nThe book assesses the likely future trajectory of the PLA (all its arms), based on the essential hypothesis that 'Grand Strategy' leads to 'Military Strategy' and concomitant 'Tasking', which enjoins the necessary 'Capability Develop ment', leading to 'Modernisation' that dictates the 'Reorganisation and Re structuring', from which the 'Assessed Current Status' and the 'Likely Future Trajectory and the Implications' for the region are analysed. Andrew Delfosse Badgery: Australia's most significant aviation pioneer - reviewed by Bob Treloar\n\nA Biography of Australia's most significant aviation pioneer, recounts Delfosse's upbringing in a pastoral family in New South Wales; early working life; travel to England to learn to fly; construction of the first Australian built aircraft; exhibition flying in Sydney and Tasmania; military service in the Middle East with the Australian Flying Corps; challenges instructing in England; and finally, return to Australia. The biography provides a wonderful insight into the blossoming world of flight when single seat, flimsy aircraft that could get airborne if the wind was gentle and little turbulence. Despite many setbacks, his adventurism and enthusiasm were never dampened.\n\nCover\n\nPortrait of Field Marshal Sir Thomas Albert Blamey, GBE, KCB, CMG, DSO, CStJ, ED, by Captain Sir William Alexander Dargie, CBE.

This paper describes the AUKUS tripartite relationship; outlines the eight AUKUS Pillar 2 technology and collaboration initiatives; and looks in detail at the planning for Australia's acquisition of nuclear-powered attack submarines under AUKUS Pillar 1. Strategic implications for Australia and the Indo-Pacific region are noted and the author concludes that AUKUS will provide a foundation for enhanced national and regional security.\n\nThe Solomon Islands: a target for foreign influence in the Pacific - John Howells\n\nDrawing on his experience as a military history tour guide in the Solomon Islands, the author outlines the historic background, geographic and cultural characteristics, and ethnic tensions that predispose this emerging Pacific Islands nation to foreign influence and intervention. He instances the nation's colonial history and World War II experience; the internal ethnic tensions that led to the Regional Assistance Mission from 2003 to 2017; and the renewed unrest leading to a further Australian intervention in 2021, coupled with the 2022 China-Solomon Islands Bilateral Security Pact.\n\nStrategic review of Australian Defence Force reserves - Douglas Laidlaw\n\nAs a consequence of the Defence Strategic Review which reported publicly in April 2023, Major General Laidlaw has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive strategic review of Defence Reserves in Australia. The review is to investigate innovative ways to adapt the current structure, shape, conditions of service, and role of the Reserves to determine how the Reserves can best complement the total defence workforce and provide an expansion base and followon forces in time of crisis.

The success of the mission has become legend. In this book, historian Sir Max Hastings reviews the outcomes of the raid and gives the reader cause to consider the brutal decisions made by wartime leaders in a circumstance of total war. the Classic: F/A-18A/B Hornet aircraft in Australian service by John Quaife - reviewed by Bob Treloar\n\nThe F/A-18A/B Hornet, a tactical fighter and ground attack aircraft, was introduced into Royal Australian Air Force service in May 1985. It became Australia's frontline fighter for 35 years. In the Classic, John Quaife has meticulously covered the history of the aircraft and its development, its operations, the aircrew who flew these planes and the technical personnel who maintained them.

Given the strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific and lacking an established regional security architecture, there is real potential for increasing volatility. Australia's 2023 Defence Strategic Review recommends that Australia's defence and strategic thinking 'must go back to fundamentals' that need to be understood and strategised in a geopolitical context that is uncertain.\n\nBLAMEY ORATION: Australia's defence and national security policies - Matt Thistlethwaite\n\nThe Honourable Minister Thistlethwaite notes the Commonwealth Government's defence and national security policies are being formulated in the context of Australia facing the most challenging set of strategic circumstances since the World War II. To this end, the government commissioned an independent strategic review of defence in 2022 and received the reviewers' report last February. A public version of that report, together with the government's response to it, was released in April. The government is resolved to safeguard Australiaâs national interest while supporting regional security and stability founded on sovereignty, the global rules-based order and international law.\n\nThe Strategic Outlook: Australia How might Bradley, Roosevelt and Dunlop manage strategic tensions in the Indo-Pacific - David Fawcett ...\n\nThe Honourable Senator Fawcett notes the challenge posed by great-power competition in the Indo-Pacific region. He explores the role that Australia, a middle power, might play in this context, drawing on lessons from the Dam Dusters, President Theodore Roosevelt, General Omar Bradley and Dr 'Weary' Dunlop. He considers the deterrence value of military capability, the 'big stick'; the importance of logistics, supply chains and procurement; and the provision of medical aid to nations of the Southwest Pacific.\n\nIndia, Australia and the Indo-Pacific - Manpreet Vohra\n\nHis Excellency High Commissioner Vohra noters that India has major stakes in the Indo-Pacific region that also brings to it the same set of values, liberties and rule of law that much of the world wishes to guard but which are increasingly under threat from other different systems with their alarming ambitions and monochromatic vision of how the world should be ordered and how people and societies should be governed. It is essential that the Indo-Pacific endures and flourishes to ensure future security and prosperity not just of us in the region, but also of our friends and partners beyond it. That is why the region must be governed by commonly agreed international norms, rules and practices, and that is why those who desire this end-state must work together.\n\nThe Strategic Outlook - Japan - Lauren Richardson\n\nThis article discusses Japan's perspective on defence, deterrence and Japan's shifting security policy since World War II where it was under the influence of the United States, to post-Cold War dynamics, to the current Indo-Pacific security dilemma brought about by increasing Chinese footprint in the region. Japan's longest serving Prime Minister, the late Shinzo Abe has been the architect and driver of the current Japanese outlook to defence and security, and institutionalised security partnerships like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) between the United States, India, Australia and Japan.\n\nASEAN in the Indo-Pacific: Continuity and Change - Sarah Teo\n\nThis article discusses the elements of continuity and change that have characterised the approach of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), amid the evolving geopolitical dynamics in the Indo-Pacific.

Much of the equipment is sourced from overseas, thus not providing the impetus for our domestic industry to develop and compete to provide industrial support to the ADF. Given Australia's isolated geographical position and the unreliability of international supply chains, a sovereign industrial capability is vital to our defence and national security. The Australian government should prioritise the uilding of our sovereign industrial capability.\n\nShaping Australia's international environment by Sea Power - Adam Lockyer\n\nThis paper is a brief examination of how Australia can use sea power to shape its strategic environment. It addresses how sea power can affect the future behaviour of regional actors through shaping their expectations of the likely consequences of their choices and actions.

The technologies developed under AUKUS Pillar II, like artificial intelligence, will be more critical, particularly in the medium term, than the submarines developed under AUKUS Pillar I. Regardless, legal, policy and regulatory hurdles to co-operation between Australia and America remain, especially the US.

Both the governments faced and continues to face significant political, diplomatic, economic and social challenges in the dynamic national and inter national environment. Increasing Chinese foray in the Pacific region have rewired the strategic alliances between Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Japan and India. AUKUS and Quad are two significant strategic engagements impacting the defence and national security of Australia. In light of these challenges, the previous Liberal and the current Labor governments have chartered their respective responses wherein bipartisanship between the two in the defence and national security space have upheld the Australian strategic vision and values.\n\nSeminar Proceedings\n\nTechnological dimensions of security in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean - the Oceans, Space and Near Space - Malcolm Davis\n\nThe strategic importance of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is becoming an issue for major power competition, particularly as a rising China expands its presence across the continent. Preserving the spirit and letter of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) through greater use of advanced air, maritime and space capabilities provides an opportunity for greater transparency of activities by all Antarctica Treaty System states, and in turn acts as a deterrent against any one state circumventing the treaty by exploiting grey zone activities.\n\nThe geopolitical lessons from the Arctic to Antarctica - Nengye Liu\n\nThe two Polar Regions Arctic and Antarctica are geographically different, the Arctic, an ocean covered by ice and Antarctica, a landmass surrounded by waters of the Southern Ocean. The Arctic is governed by the 'Arctic Council', comprising the five Arctic littoral countries who have their respective national jurisdictions over the Arctic region and function under various international treaties and conventions. The Antarctic continent does not belong to any single country as per the 'Antarctic Treaty'; it \"freezes\" territorial claims of the continent and devotes Antarctica to peace and science. Though the Treaty takes a \"bifocal\" approach to neither recognise nor deny territorial claims, however there are currently 55 contracting parties associated to research activities on the continent. Though the Polar Regions are increasingly getting securitised due to their natural wealth and resources, this paper concludes that the regions should be a place of peace and cooperation to preserve its vulnerable and unique environment for humanity.\n\nGeopolitical scenarios examining the potential for militarisation of Antarctica - Jeffrey McGee\n\nSince the formation of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, the Antarctic Treaty parties have been obligated to ensure the Antarctic remains non-militarised. As a result, Antarctica has often been considered as a region remote from military pressures and entirely devoted to peaceful activities, such as scientific investigation. This paper seeks to challenge this perception, firstly by noting the not insignificant history of military activities in the Antarctic region prior to 1959, and, secondly, by explaining how geopolitical scenario analysis might be used to identify and manage current and future pressures that could lead to militarisation of the region.\n\nSecurity challenges of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean: Australia s Antarctic interests - A. J. (Tony) Press\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty has significant strategic and security interests for Australia. Australia claims 42 per cent of the continent, and the Antarctic Treaty established the area below 60o S as a non-militarised region where military manoeuvres, weapons testing and nuclear explosions are prohibited. The benefits to Australia of maintaining the strength of the Antarctic Treaty System are manifold. This paper sets out the importance to Australia of the Antarctic Treaty System; Australia's Antarctic activities; and current geopolitical tensions in the system. It argues that Australia should continue to invest practical and diplomatic efforts to secure its Antarctic interests and the strength of the System into the future.\n\nCover\n\nMap of Casey Station, Antarctica.

R. Leece, I. E. Pfennigwerth, R. B. Treloar, R. P. Irving and D. J. Deasey\n\nAustralia's current defence policy broadly follows the seminal 1987 defence white paper which sought self-reliance in the defence of Australia and its neighbourhood. The current policy, however, departs from the 1987 white paper in terms of force size, structure and posture, focusing more on supporting allies abroad rather than defending Australia. As the government again seeks self-reliance in the defence of Australia, it is timely to reconsider the 1987 white paper in light of present strategic realities. Our submission attempted that exercise. We found that the 1987 policy and its underlying prescriptions remain relevant, notwithstanding significant geostrategic changes over the last 35 years. We concluded that, to achieve self-reliance now, a major expansion of the ADF and a mobilisation of the whole Australian community would be required. The submission details actions needed over the next decade (the scope of the review) to position Australia for self-defence.\n\nCover\n\nThe publication of the Defence Strategic Review.

The 2nd Division, an Army Reserve formation, has evolved beyond maintaining an expansion base as a strategic reserve. Its role now is principally operational. It maintains foundation warfighting skills; raises, trains and sustains a battle group to reinforce Army's full-time ready brigade; commands, controls and contributes force elements to domestic operations; and contributes force elements for the ongoing defence of the nation's maritime approaches.\n\nRebuilding Australia s maritime fleet - Tim Barrett\n\nAustralia s economy and national security are heavily dependent on globalised maritime trade with its unfavourable trade practices and the potential for supply-chain disruption. Australia's heavy dependence on foreign-flagged merchant shipping poses strategic risks for Australia. In contrast, major maritime nations have well-planned and co-ordinated national shipping industries well-supported by government policy. Australia needs a cohesive government-led maritime strategy with aligned regulation and policy coupled with enduring oversight of the industry.\n\nContributed Short Communication\n\nSocial media: the new intelligence collection platforms - Brant Johnston\n\nMr Johnston demonstrates that intelligence collected from social media can have tactical value in a kinetic conflict.\n\nBiography\n\nWho was ......

The world has become poorer, more dangerous and more disorderly. Post the pandemic, Australia's ability to project itself globally will start with its strength and vitality at home. Its favourable geography gives it the potential to become a leader in renewables. Given our geopolitical challenges, this is a strategic imperative. Yet, for now, the gap between reality and expectations has never been greater.\n\nThe Australian Defence Force s response to the bushfire and COVID-19 crises of 2020 - Kathryn Campbell\n\nThe Australian Army s 2nd Division is responsible for leading domestic operations and did so during the 2020 bushfire and COVID-19 pandemic crises. The Division's commander describes the Australian Defence Force's joint response to the two crises, the command and control arrangements, and interactions with civilian agencies and the wider community. Concurrently, the Division continued to fulfil its other operational and readiness training responsibilities.\n\nImproving resilience in Australia - Keith Suter\n\nOver the past century, economic theory and public policy based thereon has oscillated between big and small government, with economic rationalism now the driving force. Unintended consequences, including an unequal society, have resulted. New thinking is required informed by scenario planning. Using the latter, we could plan for the future knowing we could cope with whatever it might hold.\n\nContributed Essay\n\nForward operating bases: is there a place for them in Australia's new defence strategy? - David Leece and Ian Wolfe\n\nAustralia's defence posture has been refocused on our immediate region, but with the intent of holding any potential enemy forces as far from the Australian mainland as is practicable. A similar strategy in World War II saw Australia deploying operating bases in the Indonesian-Melanesian archipelago. This paper examines that experience, compares more successful with less successful uses of forward bases [Norfolk Island is used as an example of the former], and seeks to draw enduring lessons from that experience for Australia's current defence.\n\nBook Reviews\n\nAn Australian band of brothers: Don Company, Second 43rd Battalion, 9th Division: Tobruk, Alamein, New Guinea, Borneo by Mark Johnston - reviewed by Marcus Fielding\n\nThis book follows, in particular, three Australian infantrymen who served throughout World War II in D Company, 2/43rd Battalion, 24th Brigade, 9th Division, AIF.

Should, however, Joe Biden become the next United States president, transatlantic relations and inter- national governance norms and institutions can be expected to experience a recovery, though with some caveats.\n\nThe Battle of the Bismarck Sea - Peter Sweeney\n\nThe pivotal Battle of the Bismarck Sea was fought on 2-4 March 1943. The United States Army Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force attacked an Imperial Japanese Navy convoy transporting 6900 Japanese army reinforcements from Rabaul to Lae. Eight Japanese transports, four of eight destroyers, and 20 of 100 fighter aircraft were destroyed for the loss of four allied aircraft. Only 1200 Japanese reinforcements reached Lae and 3000 perished at sea.\n\nAustralia's national security over next 100 years: opportunities and challenges - Jim Molan\n\nWhile Australia is now the world's 14 most economically powerful nation, it has only been able to focus on its economic development because, heretofore, it has not had to provide for its own defence. With United States power diminishing and China s power increasing, Australia s historic grand strategy is becoming unsustainable both militarily and economically. To craft a way forward for the next century, Australia needs first to develop a national security strategy.\n\nObituary\n\nColonel John Malcolm Hutcheson, MC - John Hutcheson Jnr and Paul Irving\n\nJohn Hutcheson, Vice-President of the Institute and a life member, has died aged 92 years.\n\nBook Reviews\n\nH.M.
