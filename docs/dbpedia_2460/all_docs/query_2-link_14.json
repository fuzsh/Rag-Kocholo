        "text": "Homes for Scotland has today announced the appointment of Ken Gillespie as chair on a three year term with immediate effect.\n\nA key figure in the UK construction and home building industries with over 33 years’ experience, Gillespie has been responsible for the development and delivery of residential, commercial and infrastructure schemes both nationally and overseas.\n\nMost recently he was chief operating officer of FTSE 250 company Galliford Try where he oversaw revenues of more than £2 billion before he stood down from the Board in 2016.\n\nHomes for Scotland chief executive, Nicola Barclay, said: “This is a significant appointment for us. Ken’s work consulting with a wide range of stakeholders, together with his knowledge and understanding of what is required to deliver complex projects (such as the Queensferry Crossing) within our communities, brings a new dimension and perspective to our organisation.\n\n“Very much a facilitator and solutions-focused, his expertise will guide us forward as we look to increase our collaboration with those who can generate the change that is required to support the building of more homes, including government at all levels.”\n\nGillespie takes the reins at a time when housing completion levels remain 36% down on pre-recession levels and members tell HFS that it has never been harder to open new sites and get much needed new homes out of the ground.\n\nConsidering the scale of the task ahead given the numerous challenges that must be overcome if the country’s housing crisis is to be resolved, he said: “Having worked in the construction and home building sectors my whole life, I am delighted to represent an industry which is absolutely vital to the social and economic wellbeing of the people of Scotland.\n\n“My philosophy is clear: whether public or private sector, local or national government, we all need to work together, positively and progressively, to an agreed common objective which should be increasing and accelerating housing supply across Scotland to meet the needs of our growing population.”"
