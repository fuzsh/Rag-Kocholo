The real key to your success as a communicator, in my view, lay in your passion for your people, for the job you were doing and the core values that have been self-evident throughout your 43-year military career. If my experience, as a civilian rather than a military professional, is anything to go by there is no doubt what you have to say and the way in which you say it transcends the military environment.
