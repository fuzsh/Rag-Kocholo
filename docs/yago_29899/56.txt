Eleanor of Castile married King Edward I of England as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony. But the marriage was a very close one. Eleanor travelled extensively with Edward, including on the Ninth Crusade. When she died in Nottinghamshire, her heartbroken husband erected a stone cross at every one of the 12 stopping places of her funeral cortege on the journey back to London.

In this episode of Gone Medieval, Dr. Eleanor Janega finds out more about her namesake from the celebrated medievalist Dani√®le Cybulskie.
