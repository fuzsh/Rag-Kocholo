        "text": "London Central\n\nA couple of years ago, I stumbled upon a Dutch couple exiting Southend Airport asking a train-station ticket salesman: “How to get to London central?” The salesman blanked and instead left the travellers with the advice to travel to Liverpool Street Station, only adding to the confusion. Unlike most Dutch cities, London does not have a Central Station, but instead is served by several major transport hubs — Liverpool Street included.\n\nBut the couple inadvertently asked a rather poignant question; what can we call London Central? Where exactly is the centre of the city? The answer is contested, with many sites claiming the title. The commonly accepted resolution is that the centre of London is measured from the site of King Charles I’ statue not far from Charing Cross. But the same site was originally occupied by one of 12 monuments dedicated to the elusive Medieval Queen Eleanor, known as the Eleanor Cross.\n\nQueen Eleanor\n\nEleanor of Castille (1241–1290) was only 13 years old when she was married off by her father King Ferdinand III of Castille, as part of a diplomatic deal with King Henry III of England. The marriage sealed an alliance between the two kingdoms and affirmed English sovereignty of Gascogne (South-West France). Eleanor would marry Henry’s son Edward who, as a 15-year-old, was awkwardly tall and slender, which earned him the title ‘Longshanks’. The teenagers (who happened to be second cousins once removed) were used as bargaining chips in the great power game of European monarchy. But from the barren transaction that was brokered by their royal fathers, an unlikely partnership developed. Slowly, Eleanor and Edward became inseparable.\n\nAs they matured, Eleanor and Edward frequently travelled together during Edwards military campaigns, including the 9th Crusade. One night in Acre, Eleanor allegedly saved Edwards life by sucking poison from a wound to his arm after a botched assassination attempt. On their way back to England, Edward’s father Henry III died following a prolonged illness. Before he passed, he wrote a letter to Edward pleading him to return home. Since Edward was occupied fighting in the Holy Land he ignored the message. He was crowned King Edward I in 1274, and Eleanor would be Queen Consort.\n\nEleanor wasn’t one to sit around. She insisted on getting a role within the machinery of government and became part of Edwards inner circle of advisors. Moreover, she was known as a ruthless businesswoman who acquired an extensive property portfolio. This damaged her popularity described in a popular rhyme:\n\n“The King he wants to get our gold\n\nThe Queen our manors fair to hold.¹”\n\nBut it would be easy to dismiss Eleanor as the greedy Queen with a besotted warrior husband. Eleanor was highly educated and an avid reader. She also knew how to write, and managed a scriptorium — unique in Northern Europe. With the money she acquired through her property portfolio, she revolutionised the Royal household with fabulous Spanish tapestries, luxury bathrooms and a civilised dining utensil called the ‘fork’². While Eleanor devoted herself to matters of the mind and finance, Edward devoted himself ever more to war and subjugated the Welsh in 1283 after a bloody campaign.\n\nFollowing a tour of Southern France in 1289, Eleanore became increasingly ill. The exact health conditions that cloud her death are still mysterious. Malaria or family heart problems are credited to her early demise, others say she worked herself to death³. During a trip up-North in 1290, her condition rapidly worsened. She died at the age of 49 in the house of a stranger in Harby, Nottinghamshire, with Edward by her side.\n\nSuddenly, everything stopped. Edward was unable to cope and for three days the machinery of government ceased. After 3 days, it was decided the party should get a move on and bring Eleanor’s remains to London for a funeral fitting the Queen. The procession gradually moved south, spending the night in 12 different places. As part of the embalming process, Eleanors entrails were removed in Lincoln and buried there. Her heart was buried in Blackfriars, and the corpse was lain to rest in Westminster Abbey. Edward would commemorate the journey and order construction of 12 crosses placed where the funeral procession had spent the night. The final cross, the largest, would be built in the village of Charing, now known as Charing Cross.\n\nEdward turned ever more bellicose after Eleanor’s death, setting his eyes on conquering Scotland. In a series of more bloody wars, he nearly subjugated the Scots like the Welsh, earning him the title “Hammer of the Scots”. He also signed The Edict of Expulsion, ordering the entire Jewish population the be evicted from the country. It was a culmination of years of increasing antisemitism in England. Edward’s father already ordered members of the Jewish community to wear identity badges. The Edict of Expulsion remained active throughout the Middle Ages and was only overturned by Oliver Cromwell in 1657. Only now is the United Kingdom — slowly — coming to terms with this Medieval legacy, with a planned formal apology from the Church of England this year ⁴.\n\n“Gape, earth, and swallow me, and let my soul Sink down to hell⁵”\n\nAs English dynasties rose and fell, previous incumbents to the throne were frequently smeared. Eleanor married into the house of Plantagenet, which was succeeded by the house of Tudor in the 15th century. With wars against Spain in the 16th century, the legacy of Queen Eleanor was under threat. The Elizabethan Stage was famous for political satire, Shakespeare himself used it in Richard III for example. And so, Eleanor too fell victim in George Peel’s ‘The Famous Chronicle of king Edward the first’. Eleanor is portrayed as a rather violent vengeful Queen, who cared little for her subjects. The play also features a comic, yet persistent, myth that Eleanor sunk into the earth at Charing Cross and re-appeared Super Mario-style in Queenhithe, close to St Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nThere seems to have been much confusion about the function of the crosses which contributed to the myth-making. This confusion, Eleanor’s perceived wicked character, and the years of the English Civil war (where the monarchy was briefly deposed), left few to care for the crosses. The Charing Cross was finally removed in 1647. After the Restoration, the site became occupied by a statue of the recently beheaded King Charles I. Edwards reputation may not have helped to restore the cross in its former glory either; England and Scotland were now ruled by the same monarch through the Union of the Crowns. Restoring monuments commissioned by a king who was nicknamed “Hammer of the Scots”, would have been problematic.\n\nIt was only during the Romantic era that the Crosses gained more attention. The touching commemoration of Eleanor by a heartbroken Medieval King struck the imagination. Moreover, Eleanor’s reputation had been somewhat restored by historians, because more attention was drawn to the story of Eleanor selflessly saving Edward by sucking the poison from his arm — although this story is now widely believed to be a fantasy⁶. Nevertheless, artists like William Blake immortalised the scene in one of his engravings:\n\nIn 1864, a new Eleanor Cross was built outside the recently opened Charing Cross Station. The replacement cross stands around 200 meters away from the original site. Comparing the 19th-century cross with one of the 13th century remaining crosses like the one in Geddington (pictured above), the monument is perhaps less of a sombre, reflective commemoration of a deceased spouse than a lavish portrayal of royalty. At least Eleanor is no longer the wicked Queen who fell into a hole and magically reappeared. The real Eleanor, the madly beloved Eleanor, was made anew.\n\nNotes:\n\n¹ Holder, N. (n.d.).
