        "text": "Eleanor of Castile was the daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, she was born on the 13th of October 1162\n\n​in Normandy.\n\nA pawn like many a noble daughter, Eleanor's marriage in 1174 to King Alfonso of Castile was about securing and strengthening Pyrenean border and granting Aquitaine to Eleanor before her marriage went some way to achieve this. With\n\nregard to the duchy of Gascony, Alfonso later claimed the rights to it stating that it was part of Eleanor's dowry, his threat to invade the duchy came to nothing.\n\nEleanor, or Leonora as she was known in her home country, had married the king of Castile when she was twelve years old, the couple's first child, a daughter Berengaria, was born when Leonora was seventeen and she had given birth to ten more children by the time she was forty.\n\nIt is well known that Eleanor's mother, the aforementioned Eleanor of Aquitaine was a clever and resourceful woman, and Eleanor was no different, she loved the finer things in life, she built cathedrals and chapels but most importantly was responsible for and had control of the lands she owned.\n\nIn 1204, Leonora's will stipulated that she rule alongside her son in the event of the death of Alfonso whilst his heir was still a child. Ferdinand, Alfonso and Leonora's third son and heir had predeceased his father by three years meaning that the regency clause in Leonora's will came into force when Alfonso died in 1214, when ten-year-old Henry became king.\n\nLeonora's loyalty to her husband is where she and her mother differed, so devastated by her husband's death, Leonara died\n\nof a broken heart on the 31st October 1214. Her regency only lasted twenty-eight days.\n\nQueen Eleanor of Castile's tomb and that of her husband Alfonso VIII of Castile, lie side by side in the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas in Burgos, Spain.\n\nResponsibly for the young king and Castile fell to Leonara's eldest daughter Berengaria, however, tragedy arrived in the form\n\nof a falling roof tile that struck the young king and killed him. Berengaria succeeded to Castile in 1217, but within a few months relinquished her title in favour of her son Ferdinand. Berengaria later served as regent, while her son Ferdinand was away on campaign."
