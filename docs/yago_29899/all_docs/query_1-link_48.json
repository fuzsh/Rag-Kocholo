        "text": "Eleanor (1240-1290)\n\nSecond Generation\n\n2. Edward II KING OF ENGLAND of Caernarfon, son of Edward I KING OF ENGLAND and Eleanor of Castile, was born on [Julian] 25 April 1284. He had the title 'King of England'. He died on [Julian] 21 September 1327. He married Isabelle de France.\n\nIsabelle de France, daughter of King Philippe IV ROI DE FRANCE (c. 1268-1314) and Queen Jeanne I (of Navarre) (c. 1271-1305), was born between 1292 and 1295. She and Edward II KING OF ENGLAND had the following children:\n\n+3\n\nEdward III KING OF ENGLAND (1312-1377)\n\nThird Generation\n\n3. Edward III KING OF ENGLAND, son of Edward II KING OF ENGLAND of Caernarfon and Isabelle de France, was born on 13 November 1312. He had the title 'King of England'. He died in 1377. He married Philippa de Hainault.\n\nEdward III (1312-1377), became king of England in 1327. He succeeded his father, Edward II, and belonged to the Plantagenet family of English rulers. In the 1330's, Edward invaded Scotland. He won victories there but could not crush the Scottish spirit of independence.\n\nEdward's forces won the Battle of Crecy in what is now the Normandy region of France. This conflict was the first major battle between France and England in the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453). Edward claimed to be the rightful king of France, and he conquered much of that country. He paid for the war by introducing an efficient system of taxing imports. In the last few years of his reign, Edward failed to provide vigorous leadership. The French recovered some of their land, and Edward's popularity declined. Even so, he was long remembered as an ideal king and a fine soldier. Edward was born in Windsor, near London."
