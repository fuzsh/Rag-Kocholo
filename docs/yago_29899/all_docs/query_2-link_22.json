        "text": "Eleanor Of Castile (born 1246—died Nov. 28, 1290, Harby, Nottinghamshire, Eng.) was the queen consort of King Edward I of England (ruled 1272–1307). Her devotion to Edward helped bring out his better qualities; after her death, his rule became somewhat arbitrary. Eleanor was the daughter of King Ferdinand III of Castile and his wife, Joan of Ponthieu.\n\nIn 1254 Eleanor was married to Lord Edward, son of England’s King Henry III. In honour of the event, her half brother, Alfonso X of Castile, transferred to Edward his claims to Gascony. When Henry III’s baronial opponents seized power in England in 1264, Eleanor was sent for safety to France; she returned in October 1265, after Edward had crushed the rebels."
