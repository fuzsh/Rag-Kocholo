        "text": "After Kathryn Warner’s visit to Pavia in late September, she became passionate about the genealogical side of the Auramala Project, and we are very, very happy about that. Kathryn turns out to have a real talent for genealogy, and with her extremely in-depth knowledge of the 14th century royal family and it’s many, many branches, she has an edge over most other researchers. In fact, Kathryn has done what we feared was not going to be possible – she has breached the obscurity barrier from the 1500s to the 1700s, for at least one line of matrilineal descent from Eleanor of Castile. In the space of literally a few days, Kathryn managed to trace 17 generations, and since the last generation includes no less than four women, all carrying Edward II’s (well, really Eleanor of Castile’s) mitochondrial DNA. What a breakthrough! This latest generation must surely bring the research into the 1700s. Please, any reader who finds any of the women listed below in their genealogy should get in touch with us, you may be the carrier of Edward II’s mitochondrial DNA!\n\nHere is the text Kathryn sent to us in full:\n\n17 Generations of Female Descent from Edward II’s Mother Eleanor of Castile – by Kathryn Warner\n\nGeneration 1) Eleanor of Castile, queen of England, countess of Ponthieu (c. late 1241 – 28 Nov 1290)\n\nm.

With any luck should be some lines of descent to trace here]\n\nm. Thomas Burley of Greenhill\n\n/\n\nGeneration 16) Sarah Burley\n\nm. Charles Johnstone of Pontefract\n\n/\n\nGeneration 17) Jane, Elizabeth, Sarah and Barbara Johnstone [Note: I don’t have their dates of birth and death or any more info, but this must take us into the 1700s ]\n\nWith this post I’m going right back up the tree to Elizabeth Plantagenet (7 August 1282 – 5 May 1316). She was the youngest daughter of Edward I and Eleanor of Castile, and two years older than her brother, Edward II. For a short careful and detailed biography by Kathryn Warner, click here. For the Auramala project, what we want to know is not the details of Elizabeth’s day to day life, but simply who her daughters were, and dates of when she lived. However, even that creates a story! Firstly, thanks to her royal status, we actually can date both her birth and death, unlike most women of her age. We have that rare gift to medieval historians, a source! A fragment of the roll of daily expenses in Queen Eleanor’s household shows that she was churched on Sunday, 6 September 1282 (P.R.O. E 101/684/62 m.1). Since we know queens were usually confined for thirty days following the birth of a daughter, Elizabeth’s birth may be dated c. 7 August 1282. 1 We also know the location of her birth, Rhuddlan Castle, in Wales, as the Chronicle of Bury St. Edmunds states: “1282. Alienora regina Anglie apud Rothelan filiam peperit quam uocauit Elizabeth.”2 (Eleanor, queen of England, gave birth to a daughter at Rhuddlan, whom she named Elizabeth.) Moving on to her children. Elizabeth first married in 1297 (aged fourteen) the twelve year old Jan I, Count of Holland. It was a short lived marriage, and they did not spend much time together, Elizabeth choosing (of her own will, yes, that’s right, important medieval women could make some decisions!) to remain in England rather than go to Holland with her husband. She did go there for a few months in 1299, but Jan, now fifteen years old, died there on 10th November 1299. No children were born of the marriage, and a combination of distance, youth, and Jan’s ill health make it unlikely that it was ever consummated. No Dutch relations of Edward II to be traced from this line then, but fortunately, Elizabeth’s story doesn’t end here. Our seventeen year old widowed princess returned to England, and she would have known that she would be marrying again, probably fairly soon. Women of high status families, particularly when at a fertile age, were incredibly useful and powerful in politics, cementing alliances. This time she married an Englishman, Humphry de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, 3rd of Essex, and Constable of England, at Westminister Abbey on 14 November 1302. The fruits of this marriage are a goldmine for us. Eleven children in thirteen years! Including four daughters, who we will be looking into in future posts. Sadly, this state of almost constant pregnancy and childbirth must have taken its toll on Elizabeth’s health. On 5 May 1316 she went into labour, giving birth to another daughter, Isabella. Both Elizabeth and her daughter Isabella died shortly after the birth, and were buried together in Waltham Abbey. A sad end to the story, but don’t worry, there’ll be another one.

Generation 2\n\nElizabeth Plantagenet\n\nLady Elizabeth Plantagenet was born in August 1282 at Rhuddlan Castle, Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, Wales.2 She was the daughter of Edward I ‘Longshanks’, King of England and Eleanor de Castilla, Comtesse de Ponthieu. She married, firstly, Jean I Graaf van Hollant en Zeeland, son of Florent V Graaf van Hollant and Beatrix de Flandre, on 18 January 1297 at Ipswich Priory Church, Ipswich, Suffolk, England.2 She married, secondly, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, son of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Maud de Fiennes, on 14 November 1302 at Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London, England.1 She died on 5 May 1316 at age 33 at Quendon, Essex, England, childbirth.3 She was buried at Walden Abbey, Essex, England.3 From 14 November 1302, her married name became de Bohun.

Foster, a research consultant at the Family History Library, a division of FamilySearch, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. This is a privilege for the Auramala Project, as Craig is well respected professional in a highly specialised field, and is working with the largest and most detailed genealogical databases in the world. Craig has been following the direct female line of descendancy down from Edward II’s mother, Eleanor of Castille, toward the present, in the hopes of discovering a living carrier of Edward II’s mitochondrial DNA. It is painstaking and at times frustrating research, and it is not the regular work of the Family History Library, since their emphasis is on assisting people to find their ancestors. We are very grateful both to Craig and the Family History Library for the time and effort dedicated to the Auramala Project.\n\nThe family-tree mapping is an ongoing process, and we still have not found our living descendant(s), so please, genealogy enthusiasts, do keep checking on this blog and write to us as soon as you see a name appear in these genealogy blog posts that you know for certain appears in your own family tree. We really need people around the world to get involved and help us track descendants. A big thank you in advance to anybody who can help with this.\n\nSo let’s get into the nitty gritty of things, by following one of the lines that Craig has mapped out. Remember, the key aspect is that mitochondrial DNA follows the path from mothers to their children, but is NOT passed on to the next generation by men, only by women. So both men and women bear it, but only women transmit it.\n\n(The following information is courtesy of Craig L. Foster.

Of these, only female children who had female children of their own interest the research, as they are the only ones to pass on Eleanor’s mitochondrial DNA.

Beatrice of England b. c 1286\n\n17. Blanche of England b. c 1290, d. 1290\n\nUnfortunately, the line of Eleanor of England dies out very quickly, due to the extremely unhappy love-life of her daughter Joan de Bar (see Kathryn Warner’s blog on Edward II for all the details). For the moment, we will follow the line represented by Joan of Acre, the seventh child of Edward I ‘Longhsanks’ and Eleanor of Castille.\n\n7. Joan of Acre Plantagenet\n\nJoan of Acre was born circa April 1272 at Acre, Israel.2 She married, firstly, Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester, son of Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Gloucester and Matilda de Lacy, on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London, England.2 She married, secondly, Ralph de Monthermer, Earl of Gloucester before 2 August 1297, without her father’s consent, although this was pardoned on 2 August 1297. She died on 23 April 1307 at Clare, Suffolk, England.3 She was buried at Priory Church of the Austin Friars, Clare, Suffolk, England.3\n\nShe was also known as Joan Plantagenet.4 From 30 April 1290, her married name became de Clare. From 1297, her married name became Monthermer.\n\nChildren of Joan of Acre and Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester\n\n1. Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester5 b. 10 May 1291, d. 24 Jun 1314\n\n2. Eleanor de Clare+1 b. Oct 1292, d. 30 Jun 1337\n\n3. Margaret de Clare+1 b. 1293, d. Apr 1342\n\n4. Elizabeth de Clare+6 b. 16 Sep 1295, d. 4 Nov 1360\n\nChildren of Joan of Acre and Ralph de Monthermer, Earl of Gloucester\n\n1. Mary de Monthermer+1 b. 1298, d. a 1371\n\n2. Joan de Monthermer1 b. 1299 – Became a nun\n\n3. Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer+1 b. 1301, d. 1340\n\n4. Edward de Monthermer, 3rd Baron Monthermer1 b. 1304, d. b 3 Feb 1340\n\nCitations\n\n[S106] Royal Genealogies Website (ROYAL92.GED), online ftp://ftp.cac.psu.edu/genealogy/public_html/royal/index.html.

Hereinafter cited as The Complete Peerage.\n\n[S6] Cokayne, and others, The Complete Peerage, volume III, page 245.\n\nNaturally, this line continues with the children of Joan of Acre’s daughters, in this case Eleanor de Clare, Margaret de Clare, Elizabeth de Clare and Mary de Monthermer. This is a very fruitful line. As Craig Foster wrote to me in a recent email “there are thousands upon thousands of descendants. I’m a descendant in this line, but not along the direct female line, so I don’t have the mitochondrial DNA we’re looking for.”\n\nWe’ll see how this, and other lines work out in following blog posts.\n\nNote: Craig L. Foster has made extensive use of the resources of the Family History Library, and thepeerage.com"
