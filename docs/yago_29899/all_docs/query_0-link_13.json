        "text": "At the age of fifteen Prince Edward traveled from Portsmouth with his mother and the Archbishop of Canterbury to marry Eleanor of Castile the half-sister of the King Alfonso X of Castile. Both Edward were Eleanor are descended from Henry II. They arrived in Burgos, the capital of Castile, in August where the marriage was due to take place. ยน\n\nPrince Edward, his wife Eleanor, his cousin Henry (son of the King of the Romans) and many knights left for the Holy Land to join the Eighth Crsuade.\n\nKing Edward had called for the feudal army to gather at Rhuddlan in August to put down the Welsh revolt. Edward and Eleanor's daughter Elizabeth was born at Rhuddlan at this time. ยน\n\nEdward, the future king of England was born at Caernarfon Castle on the 25th April, 1284. His father was King Edward I and his mother was Eleanor of Castile. The castle was probably still under construction as work on it had only begun the year before.\n\nAt the time of his death, Alfonso was heir to the English throne as he was the eldest surviving son of King Edward I and Eleanor of Castile, but at the age of just ten at Windsor Castle he died. This left his four month-old younger brother, Edward, as heir.\n\nEleanor of Castile, the wife of King Edward I died while travelling in the North with the King. Eleanor had been suffering with illness for some time and the cold and damp of the Winter months probably aggravated her condition. ยน\n\nAs Edward travelled with the body of his wife Eleanor from Harby near Lincoln where the Queen died to Westminster a series of crosses were later erected at each location that the body rested over night. These are known as the 'Eleanor Crosses' ยน"
