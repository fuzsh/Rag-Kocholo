        "text": "12th-century English princess and queen consort of Castile and Toledo\n\nFor other people with similar names, see Eleanor of England (disambiguation) and Eleanor of Castile (disambiguation).\n\nEleanor of England (Spanish: Leonor; c. 1161 – 31 October 1214[2][3]), was Queen of Castile and Toledo as the wife of Alfonso VIII of Castile.[5] She was the sixth child and second daughter of Henry II, King of England, and Eleanor of Aquitaine.[7] She served as Regent of Castile during the minority of her son Henry I for 26 days between the death of her spouse and her own death in 1214.[9]\n\nEarly life and family\n\n[edit]\n\nEleanor was born in the castle at Domfront, Normandy c. 1161, as the second daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, and was baptised by Henry of Marcy. Her half-siblings were Countess Marie of Champagne and Countess Alix of Blois. Her full siblings were Henry the Young King, Duchess Matilda of Saxony, King Richard I, Duke Geoffrey II of Brittany, Queen Joan of Sicily and King John. Eleanor had an older brother, William (17 August 1153 – April 1156), the first son of Henry II, and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who died of a seizure at Wallingford Castle, and was buried in Reading Abbey at the feet of his great-grandfather Henry I.\n\nQueenship\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1170 Eleanor married King Alfonso VIII of Castile in Burgos at the age of 9. Her parents' purpose in arranging the marriage was to secure Aquitaine's Pyrenean border, while Alfonso sought an ally in his struggles with Sancho VI of Navarre. In 1177, this led to Henry overseeing arbitration of the border dispute.\n\nAround 1200, Alfonso began to claim that the duchy of Gascony was part of Eleanor's dowry, but there is no documented foundation for that claim. It is highly unlikely that Henry II would have parted with so significant a portion of his domains. At most, Gascony may have been pledged as security for the full payment of his daughter's dowry. Her husband went so far on this claim as to invade Gascony in her name in 1205. In 1206, her brother John granted her safe passage to visit him, perhaps to try opening peace negotiations. In 1208, Alfonso yielded on the claim. Decades later, their great-grandson Alfonso X of Castile would claim the duchy on the grounds that her dowry had never been fully paid.\n\nOf all Eleanor of Aquitaine's daughters, her namesake was the only one who was enabled, by political circumstances, to wield the kind of influence her mother had exercised. In her marriage treaty, and in the first marriage treaty for her daughter Berengaria, Eleanor was given direct control of many lands, towns, and castles throughout the kingdom. She was almost as powerful as Alfonso, who specified in his will in 1204 that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death, including taking responsibility for paying his debts and executing his will. It was she who persuaded him to marry their daughter Berengaria to Alfonso IX of León. Troubadours and sages were regularly present in Alfonso VIII's court due to Eleanor's patronage.\n\nEleanor took a particular interest in supporting religious institutions. In 1179, she took responsibility to support and maintain a shrine to St. Thomas Becket in the cathedral of Toledo. She also created and supported the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, which served as a refuge and tomb for her family for generations, and its affiliated hospital.\n\nRegent\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Alfonso died, Eleanor was reportedly so devastated with grief that she was unable to preside over the burial. Their eldest daughter Berengaria instead performed these honours. In accordance with the will of her late spouse, Eleanor became regent of Castile during the minority of her son, in which her daughter acted as her advisor.[17] Her reign was not to be long, however; she was reportedly not in good enough health and left most of the affairs of state to her daughter, which created fear and opposition among the nobles that she was planning to leave the regency to her daughter.[18]\n\nEleanor later became sick and died only twenty-six days after her husband, and was buried at Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas.[19]\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nName Birth Death Notes Berengaria Burgos,\n\n1 January/\n\nJune 1180 Las Huelgas near Burgos,\n\n8 November 1246 Married firstly in Seligenstadt on 23 April 1188 with Duke Conrad II of Swabia, but the union (only by contract and never solemnised) was later annulled. Married in Valladolid between 1/16 December 1197 with King Alfonso IX of León as his second wife.[20] After their marriage was dissolved on grounds of consanguinity in 1204, she returned to her homeland and became regent of her minor brother King Henry I. Although Queen of Castile in her own right, after the death of Henry I in 1217, Berengaria quickly abdicated in favour of her son Ferdinand III of Castile who would re-unite the kingdoms of Castile and León. Sancho Burgos,\n\n5 April 1181 26 July 1181 Robert of Torigny records the birth \"circa Pascha\" in 1181 of \"filium Sancius\" to \"Alienor filia regis Anglorum uxor Anfulsi regis de Castella\".[21] \"Aldefonsus...Rex Castellæ et Toleti...cum uxore mea Alienor Regina et cum filio meo Rege Sancio\" donated property to the bishop of Segovia by charter dated 31 May 1181.[22] \"Adefonsus...Rex Castellæ et Toleti...cum uxore mea Alienor Regina et cum filio meo Rege Sancio\" donated property to the monastery of Rocamador by charter dated 13 July 1181.[23] Sancha 20/28 March 1182 3 February 1184/\n\n16 October 1185 King Alfonso VIII \"cum uxore mea Alionor regina et cum filiabus meis Berengaria et Sancia Infantissis\" exchanged property with the Templars by charter dated 26 January 1183.[24] Henry before July 1182 before January 1184 The dating clause of a charter dated July 1182 records \"regnante el Rey D. Alfonso...con su mugier Doña Lionor, con su fijo D. Anric\".[25] The dating of the document in which his sister Sancha is named suggests that they may have been twins. Ferdinand before January 1184 Died young, ca. 1184? The dating clause of a charter dated January 1184 (\"V Kal Feb Era 1222\") records \"regnante rege Alfonso cum uxore sua regina Eleonor et filio suo Fernando\".[26] Urraca 1186/\n\n28 May 1187 Coimbra,\n\n3 November 1220 Married in 1206 to Infante dom Afonso of Portugal, who succeeded his father as King Afonso II on 26 March 1212.

On whose behalf Diego of Acebo and the future Saint Dominic travelled to Denmark in 1203 to secure a bride.[27] Ferdinand was returning through the San Vicente mountains from a campaign against the Muslims when he contracted a fever and died. Mafalda Plasencia,\n\n1191 Salamanca,\n\n1204 Szabolcs de Vajay says that she \"died at the point of becoming the fiancée of the Infante Fernando of León\" (without citing the primary source on which this information is based) and refers to her burial at Salamanca Cathedral.[29] Betrothed in 1204 to Infante Ferdinand of Leon, eldest son of Alfonso IX and stepson of her oldest sister. Eleanor 1200 Las Huelgas,\n\n1244 Married on 6 February 1221 with King James I of Aragon. They became separated on April 1229 on grounds of consanguinity. Constance c. 1202 Las Huelgas,\n\n1243 A nun at the Cistercian monastery of Santa María la Real at Las Huelgas in 1217, she became known as the Lady of Las Huelgas, a title shared with later royal family members who joined the community. Henry Valladolid,\n\n14 April 1204 Palencia,\n\n6 June 1217 Only surviving son, he succeeded his father in 1214 aged ten under the regency firstly of his mother and later his oldest sister. He was killed when he was struck by a tile falling from a roof.[31]\n\nLater depictions\n\n[edit]\n\nEleanor was praised for her beauty and regal nature by the poet Ramón Vidal de Besalú after her death. Her great-grandson Alfonso X referred to her as \"noble and much loved\".\n\nEleanor was played by actress Ida Norden in the silent film The Jewess of Toledo.[citation needed]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nAndrews, J.F.
