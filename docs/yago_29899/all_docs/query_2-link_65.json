Eleanor of Castile married King Edward I of England as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony. But the marriage was a very close one.

When she died in Nottinghamshire, her heartbroken husband erected a stone cross at every one of the 12 stopping places of her funeral cortege on the journey back to London. In this episode of Gone Medieval, Dr. Eleanor Janega finds out more about her namesake from the celebrated medievalist Danièle Cybulskie.This episode was edited by Joseph Knight and produced by Rob Weinberg.Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free original podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians including Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsley, Matt Lewis, Tristan Hughes and more.
