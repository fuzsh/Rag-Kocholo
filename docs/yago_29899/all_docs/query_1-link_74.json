        "text": "Eleanor of Castile was born in 1244 into Spanish royalty, the daughter of Ferdinand III of Castile and his wife, Joan, Countess of Ponthieu. Baptised Leonor, her name was Alienor or Alianor in 13th century England, and Eleanor in modern English. She was also descended from English royalty – her great-grandmother (also called Eleanor) was the daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England. Eleanor received a high standard of education, unusual for the time, which helped to equip her for her later responsibilities as queen.\n\nAs was often the case, royal marriages were used to forge alliances, not a matter of love. As a child, Eleanor’s marriage had been arranged - to Theobald II of Navarre, as a means to stake a claim on Navarre (in the Basque region of modern-day Spain). This plan was scuppered by Theobald’s mother, Margaret of Bourbon who had other alliances in mind.\n\nInstead, aged 13, Eleanor married the future King of England, Edward I. The wedding took place in November 1254 at a monastery in Burgos, Spain. Another important political alliance, this confirmed English sovereignty over Gascony (in South West France). Stamford has a bit-part in the story of their union. It was given to Edward on the occasion of his marriage to Eleanor.\n\nEleanor was also involved in key military decisions alongside her husband. During the Second Barons’ War, Eleanor supported and contributed to Edward’s war effort by bringing over archers from Ponthieu in France. She remained in England during the conflict, maintaining control over Windsor Castle. Eleanor was later captured and held at Westminster Palace for a year until royalist forces finally defeated the barons at the Battle of Evesham in 1265.\n\nA fantastic story from her travels with Edward tells that she that she saved his life by sucking the poison from his arm after he was stabbed with a poisoned dagger, risking her life to save his. Edward did suffer an assassination attempt whilst he was leading a Crusade in Acre, Palestine and the attack caused a serious wound in his arm, but he was saved by a surgeon who cut away the diseased flesh. Eleanor was there, distraught by his bedside, but sadly that’s the only truth in the tale. Edward had become king in 1272 whilst on this Crusade and he and Eleanor were crowned King and Queen on 19 August 1274 after their return to England.\n\nEleanor was a highly educated woman who had a wide variety of interests. She became a patron of literature, creating the only royal scriptorium known to have existed in Northern Europe at the time, and employed scribes and at least one illuminator to copy books and produce new works. Her horticultural designs included fountains – a common Castilian garden design feature which became fashionable in England due to her influence. Her style also began to seep into the homes of the upper classes who embraced the new fashion for carpets, tapestries and fine tableware. She had a huge cultural impact on the higher echelons of English society.\n\nMore controversial was her involvement in finance, initiated by Edward himself. The level of her economic activity was exceptional for the time. Between 1274 and 1290 she accrued a large number of valuable estates. Edward wanted to ensure financial security for his wife without drawing on much needed government funds. And at this point we encounter the 13th century’s rampant anti-Semitism. Originally playing an essential role as moneylenders, (forbidden by the Christian Church but not in Judaism) the Jewish community were direct subjects of the king, and increasingly taxed and attacked. Stamford wasn’t immune – in 1242 the Jewish Synagogue in Stamford was burned to the ground.\n\nEdward’s Statute of the Jewry in 1275 outlawed all lending at interest and gave Jews fifteen years to readjust. Taking over the debts of Christian landlords owed to Jewish moneylenders who could no longer trade, Eleanor offered to cancel the debts in exchange for land pledges. The way in which these estates were acquired did not make her popular. She became the subject of gossip and was seen as greedy and grasping. The Archbishop of Canterbury cautioned her about her actions. A rhyme from the time stated:\n\nLe Roy cuvayte nos deneres - The king covets our money\n\nEt la Rayne nos beaus maners - And the queen our lovely manors\n\nIt was during one of Eleanor’s trips to monitor and review her vast estates that she died - at Harby in Nottinghamshire on 28 November 1290, aged only 49, with Edward at her bedside. The queen, accompanied by the king and their enormous retinue had left London in summer 1290, but by the autumn, Eleanor was ill. On 24 November the Liber Garderobe which recorded household receipts and payments noted that the queen:\n\n…at that time having (sic) become infirm.\n\nOn 28 November, a messenger was sent to buy ingredients for medicines, but sadly the trip was in vain. The Liber Garderobe concludes its entries for the day with the words:\n\nDecessus Regine – the queen died.\n\nEleanor’s death may have been caused by an infection or septicaemia after she contracted malaria in Gascony, or heart disease which her father, grandfather and brother Alfonso may have also suffered.\n\nSo begins the most famous part of Eleanor’s story. Her body was taken in a grand procession from Harby to London for burial at Westminster Abbey. The queen’s body was visible during the journey, rather than being placed in a coffin, and her corpse was dressed in loose robes, was wearing a crown and carried a sceptre as if for a coronation. Macabre to our modern sensibilities. Edward rode some distance behind the bier, giving pride of place to his loyal and much-loved queen.\n\nThe cortege made an overnight stop approximately every 20 miles on the very long journey (12 stops - at Lincoln, Grantham, Stamford, Geddington, Hardingstone near Northampton, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans, Waltham, Westcheap, and Charing Cross). To mark the route, a stone monument was commissioned and erected in her memory at each of the 12 stops as a mark of Edward’s undying affection for Eleanor.\n\nThe cortege arrived in Stamford on 5 December 1290 and stayed for 2 days.\n\nStamford’s Eleanor Cross, one of the last to be completed, was most likely situated beyond Scotgate, on what is now Casterton Road, on the left-hand side near Fox Dale. It stood for approximately 350 years, Captain Richard Symonds of the Royalist army, who visited Stamford on his way from Newark to Huntingdon on 22 August 1645, wrote in his diary:\n\nIn the hill before ye into the towne stands a lofty large cross, built by Edward I in memory of Eleanor whose corps rested there coming from the north. Upon the top of this cross these three shields are often carved: England; three bends sinister; a bordure (Ponthieu); Quarterly Castile and Leon.\n\nRichard Butcher, Town Clerk, also wrote in his survey of Stamford of 1646:\n\nNear unto the York highway and about twelve score paces from the town gate which is called Clement Gate, stands an ancient crosse of freestone of very considerable fabric, having many ancient scrutcheons or arms insculped in the stone about it as the arms of Castille and Leon quartered being the paternal coat of the King of Spain and divers other hatchments belonging to that crown which envious time hath so defaced that only the ruins appear to my eye and therefore not to be described by my pen.\n\nIt was destroyed soon after.\n\nThe current Eleanor Cross divides opinion, is it art or an atrocity? It was designed by Wolfgang Buttress, a sculptor from Nottingham, and incorporates aspects of the original. Luckily, William Stukeley, the eminent Georgian resident of Stamford’s Barn Hill excavated the site in 1745 and some of the stones from the original Eleanor Cross were later discovered in his garden! One of these, a stone rose carved from Purbeck marble (which can be viewed in the library amongst the Discover Stamford collection) was used as the inspiration for the roses carved into the new sculpture. Words from 150 Japanese Haiku poems can be spotted in bronze studs all around the base of the sculpture and on the surrounding seating. These echo the original intention of the Eleanor Crosses, love and remembrance. How romantic!"
