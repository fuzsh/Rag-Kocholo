        "text": "Deborah Joan Kerns Huffman, 64, of Sumerco, WV, went home to be with the Lord and her husband, Terry, on Thursday, August 10, 2023, leaving from her residence.\n\nBorn November 20, 1958, in Boone County, WV, she was a daughter of the late Ralph D. Kerns, Sr., and Eunice L. Baisden Kerns.\n\nIn addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her husband, William “Terry” Huffman; one step-daughter, Angie; and one sister, Diana Perdue.\n\nDebbie was a proud member of Sand Fork Missionary Baptist Church and loved her church family. She was a retired nurse who dedicated her life to taking care of and loving others. She always put others before herself. She loved riding horses, camping, and telling stories around the campfire while making everyone laugh. She will be greatly missed. To know her was to be loved by her.\n\nSurvivors left to cherish her memory are her step-son, Brian and step-grandson, Caleb; her siblings, Roger D. (Madilyne) Kerns, Ralph D. (Sherry) Kerns, Jr., Edith Hall, and Linda (Ricky) Christian; special friends and trail riding partners, Kevan and Samantha Breedlove; and a host of many nieces and nephews along with other dear relatives and friends.\n\nA celebration of Debbie’s life will be held on Tuesday, August 15, 2023, at 6:00 p.m. at the Sand Fork Missionary Baptist Church in Griffithsville, WV.\n\nA special thanks goes out to Melanie, Tiffany, and Libby of HospiceCare for the wonderful and loving care they provided.\n\n“Until we meet again, my friend.”\n\nArrangements have been entrusted to the care of Evans Funeral Home & Cremation Services at Chapmanville, WV."
