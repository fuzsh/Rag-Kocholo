        "text": "No one is prepared to have an accident. It often feels overwhelming for a newly injured person and their family. Our experienced team of injury attorneys and paralegals puts those worries to rest. Our firm ensures our clients understand their rights and how their case will proceed. We work together with you to ensure the best possible result for your case and – most importantly – for your health by clear and prompt communication.\n\nChoosing an injury firm means choosing who to trust with your health and medical care. Although we practice Workers’ Compensation throughout Florida, Personal Injury and Auto Accidents nationwide, and Defense Base Act worldwide, many clients choose Attorneys Jo Ann Hoffman & Associates, P.A. because of our location in South Florida and our familiarity with the best medical resources available throughout Fort Lauderdale, Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties.\n\nOur clients can feel confident that their case AND health will have the best possible result in the hands of our firm. We are confident in our results, too, which is why we work on a contingent fee basis for our cases. We don't get paid until you get paid in auto accident cases, contingency means only when we win you a settlement, we get paid a percentage of the settlement for our services. Know that if we don’t win you a settlement then our firm doesn’t get anything, and you don’t owe us anything for our services. With the Defense Base Act cases, all of the settlement money goes to our clients and the insurance company pays our fees separately.\n\nToo learn more about our contingency fee program, find out if you have a case, or answer any other question you have. We have a FREE and CONFIDENTIAL consultation – just give us a call/text at 954-772-2644, fill out the contact form on the contact us page, or just click our CHAT icon. A consultation is an opportunity for you to ask us about your specific situation and we will explain what we can do to help – there is no obligation afterwards to hire us or file a claim, but some benefits you are entitled to may have time limitations to file a claim so we do recommend contacting us today. For instance in Florida, if you do not see a doctor within 14 days of your car crash, you just lost $10,000 in PIP benefits."
