        "text": "If, like me, you are wondering what exactly took place during the recent 83rd Texas State Legislature Session and its two subsequent Called Sessions, then you may want to join us on October 23rd to find out.\n\nSpeaking to us will be State Senator, Joan Huffman and State Representative, Sarah Davis. These two dynamic women will provide an overview of the session and recap the “winners” and “losers” of sponsored bills with an emphasis on the roles they played in important votes.\n\nCurrently in her third term, Sen. Huffman serves as chairwoman of the Texas Senate Republican Caucus and vice-chairwoman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee in addition to her work on the Finance, State Affairs and Health and Human Services Committees. Rep. Davis is in her second legislative term where she serves on the Public Health, Calendars and Appropriations Committees. Very busy ladies, indeed.\n\nSo, mark your calendars and come hear how women are playing an increasingly important role in shaping our great state for generations to come. We may even get to find out if either of them owns a pair of pink sneakers and what plans they have for wearing them! ~ Carol Prince, Programs"
