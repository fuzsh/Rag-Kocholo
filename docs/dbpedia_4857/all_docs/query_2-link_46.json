        "text": "WEIMAR — Texas Senator Joan Huffman celebrated a major milestone for the city of Weimar as they recognize their 150th year of existence.\n\nHuffman took a tour of the Weimar Heritage Museum before the council meeting, leaving behind a resolution from the capital recognizing Weimar for reaching such a milestone in its town’s history. The resolution, an address from Governor Greg Abbott, included a short summary of the town’s origins as well as a message highlighting the progress of the town and Texas at large. Abbott expressed his personal excitement for the town with his own contribution to the celebrations.\n\nFollowing resolution delivery at the museum, Huffman accompanied the council to the regular meeting at 3 p.m. There, Huffman received a key to the city from Mayor Milton Koller and the rest of the councilmembers to express their own appreciation for Huffman and the Texas government. Through the city’s elected officials, Weimar expressed gratitude to the state for adding a special historical mark to its milestone anniversary."
