        "text": "First Lady Jill Biden and President Joe Biden - who made Texas property tax cuts possible in 2023 with covid stimulus infusion. Photos on X James Talarico and Gina Hinojosa celebrate school vouchers burial with fellow Texas House Democrats as major victory for public education.\n\nBest of the Legislature: Patrick Has His Way\n\nBut Biden Makes It Rain for Top Achievement\n\nCapitol Inside\n\nDecember 27, 2023\n\nOur tentative all-star team for the 2023 Texas Legislature did not include a single Democrat or state House member from either party. All of the lawmakers who voted for Attorney General Ken Paxton's impeachment or Bryan Slaton's expulsion from the Texas House or both were automatically disqualified. Both votes were unjustified attacks on democracy that raised the bars on hypocrisy at the statehouse in Austin to the highest levels in modern times.\n\nBut that only left 16 senators for the GOP in the running for the Capitol Inside list of the 10 best performances at the Texas Capitol this year. We couldn't find that many who were worthy of such an accolade in 2023 when the Legislature here met for 246 days in regular session and four special gatherings that Governor Greg Abbott called in the past seven months. That's the all-time record for a calendar year in the Lone Star State.\n\nBut there were not 10 best lawmakers at the Texas Capitol in 2023 based on the standards that we've been employing for the past 20 years here. So we waived the exclusions for votes on Slaton's ouster and the attempted assassination of an attorney general who Texas House leaders transformed into a cult figure who's far more dangerous now than anyone could have imagined before the failed impeachment. Here's what we found ...\n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER(S) - Joe Biden & Dan Patrick\n\nA record-breaking property tax relief package that cleared a second summer session was the only significant accomplishment that would benefit a majority of Texans if it lives up to the hype. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick drove the train on property taxes and got everything he demanded in the final plan. GOP State Senator Paul Bettencourt of Houston is a first-team all star as well as the author of the plan in his role as the Local Government Committee chairman.\n\nBut the Republicans who control the Legislature failed to recognize that there would have been no real tax cuts if not for the Democrats in Washington D.C. The federal stimulus package that Texas reaped for the covid pandemic poured the foundation for the Texas tax reduction with a massive infusion about the same size as the property tax reduction here in 2023.\n\nThe Democrats in Congress approved the Texas emergency care package at the urging of the White House without a single vote of support from the Republicans. There would have been no tax cuts without Biden and the Democrats. So Biden is the honorary Most Valuable Player for the Best of the Texas Legislature in 2023. Patrick is the MVP as far as actual state legislators are concerned - having crafting a package that had everything he wanted with little more than crumbs for the House.\n\nBut Patrick made his biggest splash this year as the trial judge in the Senate Court of Impeachment that he ran like he'd been doing it all his life. He played it by the book on paper after vowing to be a serious jurist who would be presumably be fair and impartial as though he didn't care on way or the other where Paxton got the boot. Patrick ruined his bid for an Oscar when he accepted $3 million for his campaign from Paxton's richest supporters just one month after the House voted to impeach. The lieutenant governor rewrote the pamphlet on the arrogance of invincibility. Patrick gave his blessings to an immigration bill that will go down as a half-baked publicity stunt if it fails to survive a court challenge as widely expected. Patrick says Senate lawyers determined that the migrant arrest and deportation measure would pass judicial muster. That's intriguing in light of the fact that the new Texas law appears to be blatantly illegal as an attempt to preempt federal law and pirate a major government function away from the U.S. government based on a semantics charade with the word invasion. Senate Bill 4 is grandstanding at best.\n\nGOP Speaker Dade Phelan enjoyed one of the most successful regular sessions for a Texas House leader in history. But power corrupts - and the speaker let his team get swept in delusions of saintliness and grandeur with a General Investigating Committee that fancied itself as a guardian of morality and purity. Phelan and his top lieutenants may have thrown it all away with an impeachment that they portrayed as a foregone conclusion when it never really had a chance in Patrick's tribunal where Paxton was acquitted on September 16. Sixty House Republicans voted to impeach the three-time elected AG. Forty-two Republicans who voted to kick Paxton out are facing primary challenges in 2024 when Phelan and the failed impeachment will be the central issues in re-election races. Phelan may need an extraordinary showing to escape with the nomination again in his home district where David Covey and Alicia Davis are gunning for him in round one.\n\nSenate women Sarah Eckhardt, Angela Paxton, Donna Campbell, Judith Zaffirini, Joan Huffman, Lois Kolkhorst, Carol Alvrado, Morgan LaMantia\n\nTEN BEST\n\n* Paul Bettencourt. The Texas Senate Republican seems like he was born to cut property taxes. That's been his main chore since Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick created the Local Government Committee for him to run. Problem is, none of the Legislature's property tax reduction bills have done so in a way that anyone could notice. Property taxes are always going to be high and rising in Texas as long as there's no income tax and the economy is strong. Property taxes are supposed to go up when times are good. But Bettencourt finally had some real money to work with this year thanks mostly to President Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress and the covid stimulus package they approved in the face of opposition from every single Republican in the U.S. House and Senate. That gave Texas lawmakers the luxury of balancing a budget in 2021 without the need for draconian spending cuts. And it effectively freed up the cash that Bettencourt astutely incorporated into a homestead exemption as the least regressive of the options that were on the table. Bettencourt does the heavy lifting and Patrick gets the credit. Bettencourt might be ready for a new assignment next time around if the property tax relief measures he crafted this year live up to the hype.\n\n* Brian Birdwell. The Texas Senate Republican from Granbury set himself free from the Dan Patrick puppet strings in the fourth and final special session when he refused to go along with a blatantly illegal migrant arrest and deportation bill that he had been sponsoring as the first and only Border Security Committee chairman in the east wing. The lieutenant governor thought he could trust Birdwell to carry his water without questions or protest after the border panel boss voted exactly like all the other Senate Republicans on every other major issue. Patrick even tapped Birdwell to chair the special committee that approved the Senate impeachment trial rules during the summer. But Birdwell demonstrated that he wasn't a total yes man or robot when he strenuously objected to Senate Bill 4 on the grounds that he'd taken an oath in the military to defend and to protect the United States. SB 4 will be thrown out in the courts because it would supercede federal law by effectively pirating the enforcement of immigration law away from the federal government. Patrick says his lawyers read the bill and say it will be upheld. SB 4 will go down as a hair-brained publicity stunt if he's wrong. Birdwell almost died at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001 when he was stationed there as a career officer.\n\n* Travis Clardy. The Texas House Republican from Nacogdoches proved to be a one-of-a-kind original at a Capitol where that's been a dying breed in recent years. A lawyer who's served in the House for 11 years, Clardy was one of about a dozen House Republicans who opposed Abbott's coveted school vouchers bill every step of the way in 2023. But Clardy was the only GOP representative who opposed education savings accounts and the attorney general's impeachment as well. With Phelan's hold on the gavel in serious peril, the big East Texan could a potential candidate for speaker in 2025 as someone who Paxton loves and most if not all of the Democrats would be eager to support.\n\n* Joan Huffman. The Texas Senate Republican from Houston has evolved in the past few years into the Legislature's most powerful member who's not a presiding officer. But that's not because she's best buds or tight with Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Huffman - quite the contrary - may be the hardest Republican for the Senate president to control among the GOP members who aren't already in the doghouse. But she's also the most cerebral, most experienced and most proven workhorse in the Senate's ruling party. Huffman made the state budget look easy in her second regular session as the Finance Committee chair. She passed a bill that paved the way for a $5 billion infusion for retired teachers. She shepherded an array of significant measure to the finish line on issues including a fentanyl crackdown, broadband accept, prosecuting attorney misconduct, luggage for foster kids and sales tax exemptions for diapers, baby bottles, feminine hygiene products and other maternal needs. Huffman took the lead in a fourth and final special session on a $1.5 billion outlay for the construction of the state's novel border wall. The Republicans in Austin have poured billions of dollars into border security during the past three years and have failed to force a single migrant to return to Mexico. Huffman will be hoping that Senate Bill 3 won't just throw more money down the drain. That would be a first.\n\n* Todd Hunter. The veteran Corpus Christi lawmaker is the only Texas House Republican on the 10 best list after backing Paxton's impeachment. But Hunter is one of the few who knew who how to handle the backlash without digging the proverbial hole deeper like most colleagues would do. Hunter is one of the few House Republicans who backed impeachment and running unopposed in the March primary despite it. As the State Affairs Committee chairman, Hunter was the go-to guy in the lower chamber on the much-maligned Texas power grid and economic development incentives with local tax breaks. Hunter crafted the redistricting plan two years ago that aimed to ensure GOP control of the House for another decade. While GOP leaders and lawmakers have focused massive time solving imaginary issues that they create for that purpose, Hunter gets the important work done and makes it look easy every time.\n\n* Dan Patrick. See above.\n\n* Angela Paxton. The Texas Senate Republican from McKinney did not make the all-star team here for the first time as a consequence of anything she did in the five separate sessions that were held this year. Paxton passed her first semi-major piece of legislation in the regular session with a new regulatory measure that was designed to rid the libraries at public school of materials that Governor Greg Abbott portrayed as pornography. The Republicans cured the school porn problem the year after they discovered it. That's fast work. Paxton made the all-star team as a product of the performance she delivered in the Court of Impeachment as the loyal wife who stood by her man while embracing her Senate family at the same time in an epic juggling act. Paxton couldn't vote or participate in deliberations as a result of rules that had Patrick's blessing. But spent breaks working the floor for husband simply by virtue of the fact that she was there and being friends with her friends there who did have votes on her spouse's fate. Paxton the solon hit a home run right after the trial with a video that poked fun at the House managers' witness who misidentified a kitchen counter top that they claimed to be a bribe without any evidence to prove the damning allegation. Senator Paxton and her husband could have run for re-election at best if there'd been no impeachment. But the sky could be the limit for Paxton the lawmaker and her husband thanks to the keystone cops across the rotunda.\n\n* Toni Rose. The Texas House Democrat from Dallas has been one of the more serious and effective legislators during the past decade in an arena where the lion's share are furniture. But she's flourished outside the spotlight as one of the more reserved in a building filled with extroverts - and she's been content to let her actions do the talking. A state representative since 2013, Rose earned a reputation as a sharp and productive negotiator while serving on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee for the past seven years. But Rose finally got the chance to take the lead on major legislation - a very rare feat for a Democrat in the GOP era here - and she performed admirably as the author of a measure that extended postpartum Medicaid coverage for women for a full year after giving birth. The plan that Rose weaved into House Bill 12 cleared the House initially with only nine opposing votes from conservatives. GOP State Senator Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham guided HB 12 through the Senate where the ruling Republicans had favored no more than a six-month extension at the outset.\n\n* James Talarico. The Texas House Democrat from Austin was the most intelligent and influential voice on the winning side in a bipartisan fight to kill a school choice bill in which Governor Greg Abbott poured unprecedented amounts of political capital, resources, time and canned rhetoric. An educator who won his first House race while still in his 20s, Talarico emerged as a major force in the private school vouchers battle from his seat on the Public Education Committee. He disarmed the robots that the governor sent to make pitches for education savings accounts - and he helped shape the narrative on vouchers as a scam that's tantamount to welfare for the wealthy. Talarico accused Abbott of bidding for the state's two biggest and most conservative donors with the ESA push. Talarico comes about as close to humble, kind and non-combative as a legislator can get these days. His words and acumen were lethal weapons in the vouchers debate - and Abbott responded with silence every step of the way. Talarico summed up his feelings on the use of taxpayer funds for private school subsidies in a post on X in early December. \"Greg Abbott talks a big game about helping students and parents. But after four special sessions, he’s given our schools $0. This has never been about helping kids — it’s always been about destroying public education.\" Talarico wielded additional clout for a Democrat as a member of the Calendars Committee. The young man would be speaker material if he's still around when Democrats take the House back someday.\n\n* Judith Zaffirini. The veteran lawmaker from Laredo was one of only two Texas Senate Democrats who qualified for consideration for the all-star team in 2023. The other - Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio - is listed in the honorable mention category. Gutierrez, who's running for the U.S. Senate in 2024, has a major badge of honor for the race after Dan Patrick had Senate Republicans kill every bill that he authored this year as retribution for his tireless crusade against gun violence as the senator who represents Uvalde. Zaffirini - in sharp contrast - passed more legislation than any other legislator in Texas this year. But that's nothing new because she always does. Zaffirini guided 113 Senate and House bills to success in the upper chamber. While Abbott vetoed seven of those, second place wasn't even close. In a state where the Republicans have wasted massive sums of time on issues they've fabricated for the sake of having something to conquer, Zaffirini focused as usual on legislation that would have a real effect on issues like hazing, stalking, protective orders, crime victims compensation, sexual assault victims and more. Zaffirini has done more for people who rely on guardians than most of all the other lawmakers in Texas combined. The Republican governor tried to steal some of the credit when he vetoed a guardianship bill that Zaffirini sponsored on the grounds that he'd already signed legislation that addressed the problem. Zaffirini has been an all star here more than any other lawmaker in the past 20 years. Nobody does it better."
