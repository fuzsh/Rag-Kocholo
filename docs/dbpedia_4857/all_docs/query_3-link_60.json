        "text": "The Texas Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to redraw the state's senatorial districts as it prepares to consider the decennial redistricting process. The move comes after new maps were drawn during a special session in 2021, which critics say furthered Republicans' grip on the state and disenfranchised minority voters.\n\nWhile the approved proposal from Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, creates a special committee on redistricting, allows for public hearings that are expected to begin later this month and lends the opportunity for lawmakers to put forward legislation on the matter, the actual changes to the map are expected to be minor as the process is largely procedural to meet requirements in the Texas Constitution.\n\nHuffman said the decision to advance the resolution was born out of \"an abundance of caution to ensure the Legislature has fulfilled its duty to apportion the state into senatorial districts.\"\n\nHuffman reminded lawmakers Wednesday that the Senate is required to take up apportionment, or redistricting, during the first session after a decennial census. In addition, she cited a concern that lawmakers concluded the special session in 2021 to redraw district maps before the census results were finalized and released.\n\n\"Just like the 2021 redistricting process, this resolution is designed to address the unique nature of redistricting to ensure a fair and transparent process,\" Huffman said. \"This resolution was discussed with members this week and shared with each of you on Tuesday so it should come as no surprise.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, which included 41 members of the Texas House — all but one a Democrat, filed a federal lawsuit in November 2021 that seeks to overturn the new political districts, calling them discriminatory.\n\nThe caucus also filed a state court lawsuit in Travis County arguing that the map creating Texas House districts for the coming decade was drawn in violation of the state constitution's \"county line rule,\" which limits how counties can be carved up in redistricting.\n\nOn the same day in 2021, then-state Sen. Beverly Powell, D-Burleson, joined six Tarrant County voters in filing a separate federal lawsuit in Austin arguing that her district was dismantled to favor future GOP candidates in \"one of the most extreme racial gerrymanders in the country.\"\n\nPowell's District 10, that went to Republican Phil King of Weatherford in 2022, was cut in half, splitting minority communities and stranding many residents in districts dominated by far-off voters with far different concerns, the lawsuit said.\n\nHuffman, the chair of the new redistricting committee, said she expects to begin holding regional hearings on redistricting at the Capitol between Jan. 25-28.\n\nPick a number, any number\n\nOne by one state senators learned Wednesday just how long they will serve in the Capitol for the term they won during the November elections.\n\nIn a somewhat antiquated and quirky process that occurs once a decade after redistricting, senators were required to choose envelopes holding a number between 1-31, one for each member, with those drawing odd numbers serving four-year terms and even numbers serving two-year terms.\n\nThose who drew two-year terms will be up for reelection in 2024. If they win reelection in two years, they'll be eligible to serve two additional four-year terms. Senators who drew four-year terms, will serve until 2026 before having to seek reelection. If they win reelection in 2026, they will only be eligible to serve an additional four-year term before beginning to serve two-year terms in subsequent reelection bids.\n\nSenators who will hold onto their districts for the next four years are:\n\nBrian Birdwell, R-Granbury\n\nBrandon Creighton, R-Conroe\n\nPete Flores, R-Pleasanton\n\nRoland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio\n\nBob Hall, R-Canton\n\nBryan Hughes, R-Mineola\n\nLois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham\n\nJosé Menéndez, D-San Antonio\n\nMayes Middleton, R-Galveston\n\nBorris Miles, D-Houston\n\nRobert Nichols, R-Jacksonville\n\nCharles Perry, R-Lubbock\n\nCharles Schwertner, R-Georgetown\n\nKevin Sparks, R-Midland\n\nJudith Zaffirini, D-Laredo\n\nSenators who will serve a two-year term are:\n\nCarol Alvarado, D-Houston\n\nPaul Bettencourt, R-Houston\n\nCésar Blanco, D-El Paso\n\nDonna Campbell, R-New Braunfels\n\nSarah Eckhardt, D-Austin\n\nJuan Hinojosa, D-McAllen\n\nJoan Huffman, R-Houston;\n\nNathan Johnson, D-Dallas\n\nPhil King, R-Weatherford\n\nMorgan LaMantia, D-South Padre Island\n\nTan Parker, R-Flower Mound\n\nAngela Paxton, R-McKinney\n\nDrew Springer, R-Muenster\n\nRoyce West, D-Dallas\n\nJohn Whitmire, D-Houston\n\nOutside of the look forward to another Senate campaign season, the upper chamber appointed members to a committee dedicated to canvassing the votes for governor and lieutenant governor, which is expected to take place in a joint session Thursday.\n\nA Senate Inaugural Committee was also appointed Wednesday, just under a week before Gov. Greg Abbott's and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick's inaugurations Tuesday."
