        "text": "Legislature Makes It Easier for Southampton to Renew Deed Restrictions\n\nAs seen in the Southwest/Village News - Article by: Ben Ballanfant\n\nFirst-Term Legislator Has Passion for Representing the People\n\nAs seen in the Southwest/Village News - Article by: Michelle Leigh Smith\n\nHouse Bill 1559 by Sarah Davis\n\nNew law will save Texas history  at the court house level\n\nAs seen in the Bellaire Examiner - Op-ed by: State Rep. Sarah Davis\n\nJune 21, 2011\n\nDuring my first term as State Representative for House District 134, I was provided the opportunity to introduce and pass several great pieces of legislation. One piece of legislation that brings me great pride, and also the first piece of legislation I passed to be signed into law, is House Bill 1559.\n\nThe bill provides countless written relics of Texas history, stored in courthouses across the state, temporary protection from destruction until rules can be adopted for their retention by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission.\n\nWith a moratorium already in place on the destruction of historically significant court documents dating before 1860, HB 1559 was needed to protect historically significant documents post-dating 1860. The legislation became effective immediately, having received a two-thirds majority vote in the Legislature. I sought to have this bill take effect as soon as possible, to prevent destruction of these important documents in anticipation of the Commission adopting its new retention rules later this year.\n\nNumerous court documents at risk of destruction continue to be found, and in some cases, these invaluable documents were being destroyed simply to create space for more recent documents.\n\nBellaire resident Judge Mark Davidson who has been instrumental in the development of the Harris County District Court Historical Document Project brought the matter to my attention shortly after I was sworn into office. He explained the state of the law regarding the protection of these documents and showed me original court documents signed by Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston that were found in the basement of the old courthouse during the move to the new courthouse.\n\nI would encourage you to visit the District Clerk's Historic Document Reading Room on the second floor of the new Civil Courts Building on Caroline Street downtown, and peruse some of these documents. In addition to the historic value of these documents, they are also a financial asset of the State. In the past, district clerks would often save the envelopes they received. Due to this practice, we have a multi-million dollar stamp collection in Harris County alone.\n\nI am proud that Harris County is now a leader in preserving these documents, but not all other counties have taken steps to preserve documents of historical significance. Unfortunately, many original court documents have already been lost. One such case is that of the City of Bellaire and City of Southside Place vs. City of West University Place.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 1945, the West University Place City Council adopted a series of ordinances in an attempt to annex territory west of the city, having been previously cut off to lands north, east and south of its borders through annexation by the city of Houston in the 1930s and 40s. First, they expropriated all territory in the cities of Bellaire and Southside Place. Then, having found a boundary not surrounded by the city of Houston, they annexed land west and southwest of the city of Bellaire. This fascinating case was eventually tried on June 16, 1946, and these ordinances were overturned, setting a precedent that allowed the city of Houston to grow into the large city it is today.\n\nAdditionally, The Court Records Preservation Task Force, established by the Texas Supreme Court, made two amazing finds in Galveston County. The first, a Minute Book dating from 1861-1865, that was maintained by Judge James A. Baker, great grandfather of former U.S. Secretary of State, James A. Baker III. The book records the civil and criminal cases during the Civil War era, and also shows changes as a result of Reconstruction.\n\nThe second find was a myriad of immigration records from 1910-1930. These volumes contain pictures and other information about immigrants to the United States during the first part of the 20th century, including where they came from, and what vessel they arrived on.\n\nThanks to the fine investigative work being done by the Task Force, these precious documents were found. If they had not been tracked down, without the legislation enacted under HB 1559, these documents would still be at risk of destruction.\n\nIn addition to the support and leadership from Judge Mark Davidson, Justice Wallace Jefferson, Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court lent his support of the legislation, and his influence no doubt encouraged HB 1559's passage.\n\nDue to the efforts of many, historically significant records are being preserved, which not only benefits the legal community, but all those who love Texas history.\n\nPreserving Texas History\n\nJune 13, 2011\n\nAUSTIN  Last week, at the ceremonial signing of House Bill 1559, Governor Rick Perry and State Representative Sarah Davis ushered in legislation that will provide countless written relics of Texas history, stored in court houses across the state, temporary protection from destruction until rules can be adopted for their retention by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. \"In many cases, these invaluable documents were being destroyed simply to create space for more recent documents.\"\n\nIn 2009 the Texas Supreme Court established the Texas Court Records Preservation Task Force, charged with making recommendations for the preservation and appropriate distribution of these irreplaceable documents. There was already a moratorium on the destruction of documents dating before 1860, however documents post dating 1860 remained at risk.\n\nThis legislation was effective immediately, as provided by Section 39, Article III, of the Texas Constitution, having received a 2/3rds majority vote in the Legislature. I sought to have this bill take effect as soon as possible, to prevent any chance of these documents' destruction in anticipation of the Commission adopting their new retention rules later this year.\n\nInstrumental to this legislation receiving passage was the support it received by State Senator Joan Huffman, the bill's Senate sponsor, and Chief Justice Wallace Jefferson. For their support throughout the committee process, I would also like to thank Multi-District Litigation Judge, Mark Davidson, who brought this matter to my attention, Mr. Bill Kroger, head of the Texas Supreme Court Historical Records Task Force, former Harris County District Court Judge, Ken Wise, and Texas Tenth Court of Appeals Chief Justice, Tom Gray.\n\nSarah Davis represents West University Place, Bellaire, River Oaks, Braeswood Place, Southside Place, portions of Meyerland and Montrose, and the Texas Medical Center, and is a graduate of Baylor University and The University of Houston Law Center.\n\nThe Texas House Passes Tort Reform Package\n\nMay 10, 2011\n\nAUSTIN  The Texas House of Representatives passed House Bill 274. This omnibus bill contains five civil justice reforms designed to discourage non-meritorious lawsuits and increase the efficiency of litigation. As Vice-Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Torts, I worked very closely with the author of this bill and the relevant stakeholders, including representatives of business and both sides of the Bar.\n\nAs passed, the Bill includes incentives for parties to make early settlement offers, while encouraging opposing parties to accept reasonable offers. I believe this Bill corrects an imbalance in the current \"offer of settlement\" practice and encourages early and fair resolutions of lawsuits.\n\nThe Bill also addresses the need for expedited civil actions where the amount in dispute is more than $10,000 but less than $100,000; prohibits the creation of new causes of action unless explicitly stated in a statute; allows for the creation of a new procedure for early dismissal of meritless claims; and also allows a pre-trial appeal of trial court rulings on issues of law, rather than having the parties incur the expense and time of a full trial unnecessarily. As amended, no part of the Bill is applicable to family law.\n\nAs a practicing attorney who tries cases to Texas juries, I know how important the jury system is to dispute resolution in a free society. In order to protect that system, we need to guard it from abuse and decrease the financial burdens of civil litigation on the litigants. I feel the Bill we passed will help insure we maintain a jury system that has served us well for hundreds of years.\"\n\nHouse Bill 3802 by Sarah Davis\n\nPowering up Houston's hike and bike trails\n\nHouston Chronicle - Article by: Lisa Gray\n\nApril 28, 2011\n\nI know, I know: To stay sane, you should take happiness in whatever unlikely place you find it. But I still feel sheepish confessing that lately, utility easements have been making me smile.\n\nTransmission-line easements, to be specific: those long, wide mowed strips with giant metal towers marching across them, the backbone of our electric system. Until recently, I considered those easements necessary stretches of ugly nowhere, blank no-man's-lands where nothing happens and nobody goes.\n\nBut these days, those easements seem freighted with possibility. The difference is one of those ideas that, once it penetrates your brain, seems so obvious that you can't imagine why it hadn't occurred to you before.\n\nThe idea is this: Those easements could double as hike-and-bike paths. Those long empty nowheres could become places where people enjoy being.\n\nRoksan Okan-Vick, executive director of the Houston Parks Board, calculates that using those utility easements could give the Houston area roughly 180 miles of trails  trails that our city sorely needs.\n\nBut it's not just the sheer length of those trails that's amazing; it's what they would do for Houston's other trails. Right now, the Bayou Greenway Initiative aims to construct roughly 300 miles of trails along flood-control right-of-ways. The early trails already show how great those trails can be - parklike spaces that reveal our bayous to be some of the most gorgeous places in Houston.\n\nBut the bayous run mainly east-west, parallel to each other. The trails don't connect up; they're trails, not a trail system.\n\nBut lots of the utility easements run north-south - which gives them the power to transform separate trails into a network. You wouldn't just be able to walk, jog or bike on our trails; you'd be able to walk, jog or bike to places, transferring from one trail to another to go to work, or a park, or a friend's house.\n\nLong-term, a system like that could change Houstonians' everyday lives - and change the way that we think about Houston.\n\nHike-and-bike capital\n\nRight now, legal liability is the sticking point. Texas state law makes it hard for a utility company such as Centerpoint to negotiate a \"recreational use agreement\" with an entity such as the Houston Parks Board, the Upper Kirby management district, or a suburban Municipal Utility District. The utility companies fear that if a jogger sprains an ankle, the company could be sued.\n\nA pair of twin proposals in the Texas Legislature (House Bill 3802 and Senate Bill 1793) would fix that problem, at least in the Houston area. If passed, the relevant liability laws would look more like those that apply to parks than those that apply to malls and grocery stores. Gross negligence would still be actionable; but as at Memorial or Hermann Park, trail users would accept the risk that reasonably comes with the territory. If you fall off your bike or blow out a knee while jogging, you wouldn't be able to sue Centerpoint.\n\nBut wouldn't it be inherently dangerous to be on a trail under those power lines? Experts say no: Transmission lines are constructed to withstand a Category 4 hurricane. And even if you're fool enough to go biking during one of those, in the event that a line snaps, the electricity is cut off within a millisecond. The line is dead before it hits the ground.\n\nThirty-six states have similar laws limiting liability for recreational use of right-of-ways. And recently, a handful of places have begun to take advantage of utility easements' possibilities. (Check out, for instance, the BeltLine in Atlanta; the mountain bike trails in Manassas, Va.; the Lower Silver Creek Trail in San Jose, Calif.; and, in Canada, the gorgeous Mount Seymour Trail in North Vancouver, BC.)\n\nIf the law passes, Houston would for once be in the vanguard of a green-space movement. Given the number of trail-building entities hungry for cheap, useful park land, and the Bayou Greenway trails' success so far in turning waste space gorgeous, it's not unreasonable to believe that the Houston area's trail system - yes, Houston's - would become one of the biggest, and most useful, in the country. \"We may very well become the off-road hike-and-bike capital,\" says Okan-Vick.\n\nYou see why I've been smiling?\n\nThe Sonogram Bill\n\nMarch 3, 2011\n\nAUSTIN - Abortion is a horrible way to end a pregnancy, and although I have a deep respect for life, I was unable to support \"The Sonogram Bill,\" today in the Texas House of Representatives. To me, the issue at stake was not about abortion, but about the role of government in our personal lives. I was compelled to seek office following the passage of \"ObamaCare,\" as I am vehemently against the government involving itself in our healthcare decisions. The Sonogram Bill does just that--government interference with the doctor-patient relationship. Although I fully support informed consent, I do not support the Legislature practicing medicine. Republicans have been united against the expanding role of government, and I remain true to that principle.\n\nTexas faces many challenges this legislative session, and in a time when the cry from the electorate is so clearly against bigger government, it is inconsistent with my conservative principles to support legislation that so clearly paves the way for future state mandates on the practice of medicine.\n\nMy vote was not an easy one to make, as I am very sensitive to those who work so valiantly for the sake of preserving life. However, in light of my commitment to work against the expanding role of government and my commitment to protect the doctor-patient relationship from government interference, I simply could not support \"The Sonogram Bill.\"\n\nCommittee Assignments of the 82nd Texas Legislature\n\nFebruary 9, 2011\n\nAUSTIN - Today, State Representative, Sarah Davis (Houston) announces her committee assignments as made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Joe Straus (San Antonio), and issues the following statement:\n\n?I am proud to announce that Speaker Straus has appointed me to the House Standing Committees on Public Health and Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence. I thank the Speaker for his confidence in me to contribute to these important committees. I look forward to helping shape Texas? healthcare policy in the Public Health Committee and utilize my experience as a civil defense attorney in the Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee.?\n\n?Speaker Straus had the extraordinary responsibility of assessing the talent and ability of nearly forty new members, coupled with the seniority and overall diversity of the House membership, and the 2011 committee assignments reflect his thoughtful, measured, and balanced approach to this very important task. Republicans now chair nearly 70% of House Committees. 32 out of 36 committees have a majority Republican membership.?\n\nSarah Davis represents West University Place, Bellaire, River Oaks, Braeswood Place, Southside Place, portions of Meyerland and Montrose, and the Texas Medical Center.\n\nAfter surviving cancer, new Houston legislator set for Austin\n\nRookie legislator gets ready forAustin Cancer ordeal inspires a new direction in life\n\nHouston Chronicle - Article by: Joe Holley\n\nNovember 23, 2010\n\nSarah Davis climbed into her car one morning last week and headed to Austin for a few days. The 34-year-old Houston lawyer, newly elected to the Texas House to represent District 134, had to find an apartment, hire a staff and begin the process of familiarizing herself with the intricacies of the legislative process before the 140-day regular session opens Jan. 11.\n\nShe is one of two Republican rookies from Harris County, along with Dan Huberty in District 127, who are invading the Capital City as part of the Republican groundswell that overwhelmed Democrats across the state on Election Day. Going into the election, the GOP held a 77-73 advantage in the Texas House; the party now enjoys a 99-51 majority.\n\nDavis, whose win over Democratic two-term incumbent Ellen Cohen was considered something of a surprise, if not an upset, says she actually began her Austin journey in December 2008, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She spent all of last year in treatment, which included two rounds of surgery, six months of chemotherapy and six weeks of daily radiation. After her ordeal ended in August 2009 and after several weeks of recovery, she decided to run for office.\n\n\"At that particular time, I guess I was trying to put my disease  you know, being diagnosed at such a young age - in perspective,\" Davis said last week. \"It does change your life. And I was really searching for a way to put that in perspective, and when I finished my treatment I really felt that I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself.\"\n\nThe path she wanted to follow revealed itself on Christmas Eve, when the U.S. Senate passed comprehensive health care reform legislation. \"And it was that night that I decided I was going to run for office, because I just did not agree with the direction the country was headed for with what I considered a far-left agenda,\" she said.\n\nStill bald from the chemo­therapy, still recovering from treatment, she declared her intention shortly after the holidays to run for the Texas House as a Republican, despite having no political experience and despite having voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 presidential primary.\n\nDavis was born in West Virginia and spent her childhood in West Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado - her father is in the oil business - before moving to Houston at age 15. She put herself through Baylor University and the University of Houston Law School, and started practicing law in Beaumont with a firm that specialized in defending businesses sued by personal injury lawyers.\n\nShe moved back to Houston in 2003 and got married in May of this year, when she got her hair back. Knocking on doors in her district every weekend, she won by 725 votes.\n\n\"I did not realize that I was the underdog until after I had already won the election,\" she said. \"I really felt very confident that we were going to win, both from what we were hearing and because I think the district is a right-leaning district.\"\n\nRepresenting a district that includes the Texas Medical Center, Rice University, West University and Bellaire, she particularly is interested in health care and education.\n\nAlthough Davis strongly opposes what she calls \"Obamacare,\" she acknowledges there is not a lot she can do to thwart it beyond supporting Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott's lawsuit, filed with other state attorneys general, to prevent its implementation. She also supports so-called health care freedom legislation - laws passed in Missouri, Arizona, Virginia and elsewhere that give citizens the right not to purchase health insurance as mandated by the federal law.\n\n\"That may seem as a largely symbolic measure,\" she said, \"but, legally speaking, I think there needs to be a conflict between state and federal law in order for it to rise to a level of what would be called federal jurisdiction.\"\n\nAlthough she considers herself a committed conservative, she thus far has avoided the internecine battles some of her Republican cohorts seem eager to wage - whether it's the challenge to House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, or endorsing Arizona-style legislation against illegal immigration.\n\n\"I hesitate to comment on legislation that I haven't read,\" Davis said, \"although I will say I don't think the voters in District 134 want to live in a police state, and that's no commentary on any legislation that's been filed. Obviously, we have to secure the border and, ultimately, that is the job of the federal government to do.\"\n\nThe state's yawning fiscal shortfall concerns her, but Davis calls herself an optimist. \"I feel that we can safely handle the budget crisis.\"\n\nShameful Attacks on Speaker Joe Straus' Faith\n\nNovember 23, 2010\n\nHOUSTON - Last Thursday evening, November 18, 2010, I attended a dinner in Austin for new members of the Texas House of Representatives. I was seated next to Speaker Joe Straus. As we prayed, blessing the meal, my prayer went out to those who have religious intolerance in their hearts. I prayed that we, as Americans, have the strength, wisdom, and character to do unto each other as we would have done unto ourselves and judge our leaders based on their actions rather than with religious intolerance. Regardless of whether or not you support Speaker Straus in the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives, it is unfair, offensive, and shameful to attack him or his conservatism based on his faith. There simply is no place for bigotry in the race for Speaker of the Texas House.\n\nI hope you will join me in condemning the attacks on Speaker Straus based on his faith, and give thanks that we live in a country that respects each of our religious freedoms.\n\nWho are these guys? A visit with a few incoming House freshmen\n\nDallasblog.com - Blog Post by: Andy Hogue\n\nNovember 16, 2010\n\nA Mexican immigrant, a black man who has been Republican since the Reagan era, a trucking industry consultant and a former single mom are among the diverse new faces in the Texas House this year. And get this: all of the above are Republicans.\n\nThough the ink may still be wet on campaign literature and bill filing has just begun, we caught up with some of the newest members of the Texas House of Representatives  as well as a new Republican face on the State Board of Education  to learn a little more about them and their plans for the near future\n\n(to see a complete version of this article, visit: http://bit.ly/aGuq1J)\n\nSliding past Rep. Ellen Cohen (D-Houston) by about 700 votes on Election Night, Rep.-elect Sarah Davis said her win is proof that HD 134 in southwest Harris County is a conservative district deserving of a conservative representative rather than a far Left representative.\n\nDavis said health care is a strong concern of hers, and not just because of ObamaCares strain on the Medicaid portion of the state budget.\n\nAs a cancer survivor, she said, I have a very personal opposition to ObamaCare, which is a position shared by the majority of my constituents.\n\nDavis said she has plans to work on healthcare freedom legislation in the next session, as part of our overall effort to repeal ObamaCare \n\nI will also work hard to make sure the budget is balanced without raising taxes, and want to work to make sure the redistricting process is fair and reflective of the conservative nature of the State of Texas, she added. I would also like to work on property tax reform and voter ID.\n\nI also believe I have a high energy level, she continued, which will be necessary to stay on track and fight for the principles of limited government, lower taxes, and less spending....\n\nBiggest Upset Victory - Sarah Davis\n\nCapitolInside.com - Article by: Mike Hailey\n\nNovember 9, 2010\n\nIn a race against one of the strongest candidates that either major party has ever fielded on the legislative battlefield, Republican Sarah Davis was forced to fend for herself for the most part when some of the GOP establishment powers that be decided that she wasn't conservative enough to merit its full faith and support. The party power brokers didn't think Davis had any real chance of beating Democratic State Rep. Ellen Cohen even if they did flood the House District 134 with money on their nominee's behalf the way they were doing in other swing districts in an attempt to get as many challengers as possible in position to catch an oncoming GOP wave.\n\nCohen had been among the Democrats' most prolific fundraisers since she ousted an incumbent Republican in 2006 in an old-money district inside the loop near downtown Houston where a large number of doctors and other healthcare professionals live and work at the massive Texas Medical Center. Cohen had honed that particular skill fighting domestic violence and sexual abuse as the longtime chief executive officer for the Houston Area Women's Center - and she'd developed excellent relations with a good number of influential Republicans in the area in that role and others. Cohen had served as executive director for the American Jewish Committee for 10 years - another major gold star on her resume in the district where she was seeking re-election to a third term and highly favored to win it. HD 134 had more gay voters than any district in Texas - and most of those had been big Cohen fans as well. While HD 134 had been drawn to be safely Republican during the 2001 redistricting process, it had steadily trended Democrat to the point that Barack Obama came within less than one percent of beating John McCain there two years ago. GOP strategists had rated HD 134 as a 50-50 district a year ago when they were trying to determine which House Democrats to target in 2010.\n\nThe Republican primary had garnered little attention before Davis captured almost 55 percent of the vote en route to defeating an opponent who had the same name as one of Houston's most famous natives - Bonnie Parker. Most of Davis' funding by mid-summer had come in the form of more than $100,000 in loans from her fiance who's also partner at the law firm where she works. While Davis had some marginal success raising cash from contributors after the primary - including about $35,000 from the Associated Republicans of Texas - she would be outspent four to one by an incumbent who could have generated countless amounts more for her war chest had she thought her re-election bid had really been in jeopardy.\n\nBut Davis had rounded up enough cash to foot the bill for some limited cable television advertising and a few direct mail drops in a district that Cohen carpet bombed with flyers - and she hit the streets without the luxury of a volunteer army and started ringing as many as doorbells as possible to make a quick pitch for support after introducing herself to potential voters.\n\nWhile other Republican challengers were watching their war chests swell with major infusions of cash from Texans for Lawsuit Reform and ART to a lesser degree in the final month before the election, Davis persevered on a shoestring budget with a substantial investment of shoe leather to try to keep the race from falling off the radar completely. Davis accused Cohen of going negative with an attack piece in the mail that contended that the Republican opposed red light cameras because her contributors wanted to prohibit them. Davis called the allegations a distortion and used them as an opportunity to highlight Cohen's support from trial lawyers and a voting record that the challenger branded as \"shockingly liberal.\"\n\nIn a race against an incumbent who's courageous fight against breast cancer had been a campaign asset, the 34-year-old challenger was able to mitigate that with a personal story to tell about how she'd survived the disease as well.\n\nBut Davis still couldn't seem to get the kind of traction she'd need to have a realistic chance against an incumbent who was arguably the best House candidate that the Democrats had to offer in 2010 - and even as the wave appeared to be churning into a potential tsunami a few weeks out from the election - she was still given little or no chance to beat Cohen.\n\nOn an election night with a record number of shockers - as the GOP captured 22 House seats that Democrats were defending to give the Republicans at least 99 state representatives when the session gets under way in two months - Davis celebrated the biggest upset of them all when she beat Cohen with 50.7 percent of the vote. While Cohen fell victim to a wholesale sweep, Davis had worked her way into position to take advantage of it. Don't be surprised, however, if these two candidates meet again at some point in a rematch. Davis can expect to be well-funded for that if they do.\n\nElection Results: Davis Defeats Cohen For State Representative\n\nInstantnewsWestU.com - Article by: Sara Waisanen\n\nNovember 3, 2010\n\nWith all precincts reporting in Harris County, voting totals show that 289,903 residents cast a straight ticket ballot for the Republican Party, with 240,017 doing the same for the Democrat Party.\n\nOn the straight party early voters, 58 percent voted Republican, 42 percent voted Democrat.\n\nRepublican State Representative candidate Sarah Davis, District 134, defeated Democrat Ellen Cohen, earning 51 percent of the vote to Cohens 49 percent.\n\nRepublican incumbent State Sen.

That changed on Christmas Eve 2009.\n\nWhen the U.S. Senate passed the healthcare legislation, I just knew I had to get involved, said Davis, who at the time was undergoing chemotherapy and recovering from breast cancer. When you go through cancer like I did, I really felt this need to be part of something bigger than myself.\n\nI wasnt sure how I was going to get involved, Davis said, but it led to this.\n\n(Sarah with Harris County Judge Ed Emmett & West U.

As a conservative, I believe in keeping taxes as low as possible.\n\nAlong the way, Davis has picked up support from Mayors Bob Kelly of West University Place and Cindy Siegel of Bellaire.\n\nI want to see a state representative who is going to be very conservative when it comes to taxation cuts, said Kelly, and she convinced me she was.\n\nDavis, 34, thinks she has considerable experience for the new job she pursues, despite her relative youth for someone seeking elective office. At very least, she has recovered energy after her cancer fightenough to combat the one thing that seems more taxing than the never-ending block-walking.\n\nTheres a lot of questionnaires, laughs Davis. But, youre asking people to vote for you and they want to know why, and what you believe, so its a necessary part.\n\nLocal 2 News - The Fight for District 134\n\nSarah was interviewed by KPRC Local 2 News on Friday, October 9th.

We get up, have breakfast, head to the market and then spend a few hours looking at our purchases and sorting it all out.\n\nHER TIP: Take advantage of checking your shopping bags for a nominal fee. When you are finished shopping, you can pull around back and retrieve your checked items. It makes shopping in bulk very convenient  and me and my mom very happy.\n\nHER FAVORITE FIND: Little antique tiles with pictures of the Alamo, perfect as accents on necklaces. Also, dont leave without a few bags of candied, spicy or chocolate pecans, which makes excellent gifts and look great in a bowl.\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Trying to get to the car loaded down with purchases in the days before the market checked bags. We were downtown and could barely walk to the car, so we flagged a pedi-cab. We had so much that we didnt really fit, and it turned out that he didnt have it in him to take us the whole way. So we gave him a nice tip, walked the rest of the way and laughed for the next 10 minutes.\n\nWHY GO: It is truly unique to Houston. Theres literally every category of shopping under one roof.\"\n\nHRBC endorses Sarah Davis for Representative of House District 134\n\nOctober 9, 2010\n\nHouston  Sarah Davis, candidate for Texas House District 134, has received the endorsement of the Houston Realty Business Coalition (HRBC) for the November 2, 2010 general election.\n\nHRBC is a respected voice in local politics, encouraging the election of Representatives whos philosophys are consistent with a key American right: the private ownership of property.\n\n\"I am honored to receive the endorsement of the HRBC, a respected local organization promoting private property rights,\" stated Davis.\n\nHRBC was established in 1967 and has become known for their prominent speakers and guests during their breakfast meetings.

Fire Nancy Pelosi tour. Steele rode up to the HCRP HQ with local party Chairman Jared Woodfill and entered the Headquarters to a welcoming crowd of over 200 Harris County Republicans very intent on showing their support for their individual candidates as well as showing support for Steeles efforts to fire the Speaker of the House and return control of the Congress to Republican in the Nov 2nd election.\n\nWoodfill introduced several local candidates including Sarah Davis, State Legislature Dist. 134 Candidate, Stan Stanart, Harris County County Clerk Candidate, Chris Daniels, Harris County District Clerk Candidate and many others.\n\nSteele was introduced by US Representative CD29 Republican Candidate Roy Morales and was greeted with chants of MICHAEL, MICHAEL, MICHAEL!.

When the overwhelming majority of Americans were demanding a stop to \"ObamaCare,\" Ellen Cohen stood up against the people and called for its passage. Recent polling has continued to show that a majority of residents in District 134 are opposed to the enacted healthcare legislation. It would be nice to know if Mrs. Cohen also supports the new increases in healthcare premiums, the 16,000 new IRS agents, and the 3.8% tax on future home sales, which the act creates.\n\nDetails of the letter and its signators can be viewed here.\n\nCampaigns in High Gear - By: Bob Price with Texas GOP Vote\n\nSeptember 14, 2010\n\nCampaigns across Texas are in high gear as we race to the victory line that is the November 2nd election day. On Saturday, 9/11, I stopped in on a few Houston area campaigns to see how things are going and found some very exciting races you need to be aware of if they aren't on your RADAR screen at this time...\n\nFollowing the parade, we checked in on another candidate who is in an excellent position to help Conservatives reshape the Texas Legislature.

They campaign office opening was attended by over 100 volunteers including the Honorable Dr. Martha Wong, the former State Representative from this district. As evidenced by the wide ranges of ages and ethnicity of the audience, Davis is enjoying a broad base of support for her campaign.\n\nDavis and Herrera's races are certainly two of the best upsets in the making in Texas politics at this time. These two races give us the opportunity to unseat two of the most liberal Democrats in the Texas Legislature and replace them with real Conservatives! Please take a close look at these candidates and the races they are running. Both have a great shot at taking these seats and serving us, the Conservative voters of Texas!\n\nBellaire Young Republicans making a difference in their community\n\nSarah Davis receives endorsement of Texas Association of Business\n\nSeptember 14, 2010\n\nHOUSTON  Sarah Davis, candidate for Texas House District 134 has been endorsed by the Texas Association of Business.\n\nI am honored to receive the endorsement of the Texas Association of Business.

I am confident that Harris County Judge Ed Emmett and other Harris County local officials will conduct a fair election without the need of the federal government intervening. Ellen Cohen needs to have and demonstrate more confidence in our local officials and end her continued misplaced reliance on the federal government in Washington, D.C.\n\nHarris County Commissioners have already approved funds to replace the destroyed voting machines, and Judge Emmett, as well as County Clerk Beverly Kaufman, have assured Harris County residents that Harris County will do whatever is necessary to have a fair election.\n\nBob Kelly, Mayor\n\nWest University Place\n\n(Editors note: Kelly is a supporter of Cohens opponent for re-election, Sarah Davis)\n\nCommittee Assignments of the 82nd Texas Legislature\n\nFebruary 9, 2011\n\nAUSTIN ?
