        "text": "On December 22, 2023, in the comfort of her home and surrounded by family, Joan Ruth Huffman Heisler, 79, went home to the loving arms of her Lord and Saviour. Joan was born in Oklahoma, raised in California and lived most of her adult life in Louisiana. She was retired from a lengthy career as a loan/compliance officer. Joan loved the Lord above all else and lived her life with joy, laughter and kindness. Joan was preceded in death by her loving husband of 37 years, Robert “Big Daddy” Heisler; and her parents, J.T. Huffman and Lucille P. Burns. Joan is survived by two daughters, Shawn Wise and Melissa Ramsey Eldridge; five granddaughters, Amber Wise and Molly Wise, with partner, Devin Hooge, and Alayah Grace Eldridge and Whitley Eldridge Mihalik, with husband, Justin Mihalik; Kaitlyn Johnson, with husband, Heath Johnson; and two great granddaughters, Saylor Lynn Hooge and Harlyn Jo Hooge. The family would like to offer a special thank you to Gentiva Hospice and specifically to Aide Veronica (forever Mom’s favorite), Nurse Leslie, Social Worker Constance and Pastors Ronnie and Eddie for the exemplary care and kindness provided our family. All services will occur at Seale Funeral Home in Denham Springs. Visitation will occur from 9 am to 11 am on Thursday, December 28th with funeral at 11:00 am and graveside service immediately following at Evergreen Memorial Gardens."
