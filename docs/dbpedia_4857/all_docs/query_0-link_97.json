        "text": "Houston Post-Dispatch:\n\nWednesday Morning July 06, 1927\n\nVETERAN CITY FIREMAN DEAD AFTER CAR CRASH\n\nRiney Beecher\n\nNever in 19 years of driving and riding fire wagons and trucks did Riney Beecher, 46, 1911 St. Emanuel, have an accident during a run. Yet when he died Tuesday, it was as a result of injuries in a motor accident the day before when he was pinioned beneath a gravel truck he had been piloting to the ball game. A gravel truck! Old-timers in the department talked over in sorrow his death Tuesday, and hearing them you got the impression that Riney symbolized, in a way, that romantic chapter in the life of the city that was the horse-drawn fire wagon. For Riney Beecher used to drive those plunging steeds with consummate skill through the crowded streets as they raced with an almost human eagerness for the danger point, the heavy wagon careening wildly behind them. Those were the days when small boys lined the sidewalks to watch the fearsome columns pass and vow that nothing but the life of a fireman would ever satisfy them when they grew up. And Riney loved his horses. Chief C. J. Ollre said he always cared for them as he would have liked to be cared for had be been in their places.\n\nUNDERSTOOD HORSES\n\nAnd they understood him, those horses. They always gave their best for him. That is perhaps one of the reasons why Riney had the name in the department of always being on the spot at the right time, which was no easy thing to do when there was only one paved street in the third ward, Crawford, and when it was no uncommon thing to have to jack up the wagons to get them out of the mud. It required team work between men and horses. The old steamer, belching its thick black smoke and showers of sparks, was Riney's charge. It was perhaps not as dangerous to manage as some of the other apparatus, because it was stationed near the plugs, and usually some distance from the fire, but it was of vital importance. Without it the pressure necessary to reach high or seemingly inaccessible places with the drenching streams would have been impossible. It needed a sure man, and Riney was that. He never missed being on the job. And Chief Ollre says he was one of the most careful men he has ever had on his force. He piloted his horses always with remarkable skill and never had an accident. When changing conditions necessitated their giving way to motored cars, Riney was somewhat at a loss for a while, but he learned how to drive, the big engine several years ago and always handled it with the same efficient prudence which had characterized him with the horses. It is for that reason all the more of a shock to the chief and his many friends in the department that he should have come to his death by an accident. Riney was on his way to West End park in a truck with four friends to see the baseball game between Houston and Beaumont. He was driving. Suddenly a car shot out from behind a truck in front of them. Riney whirled to avoid it, the wheels of the truck buried themselves in a gravel pile and the machine overturned, pinning the fireman beneath it. He was rushed to St. Joseph's in a Fogle-West ambulance and some hope was held out for his recovery, but his injuries proved too serious. His connection with the department began on December 01, 1908, when he enlisted as a pipeman at station No. 10. He was later shifted to No. 8 as stoker on its steamer and shortly thereafter was promoted to engineer on pumper No. 4.\n\nSON ESCAPED\n\nIt was in 1923 that he was made chauffeur on a pumper at No. 4, the position he held at the time of his death. Among those with Riney at the time of the accident, all of whom escaped injury was his 18-year-old son, Jack. Beside the boy, he is survived by his wife, Mrs. Annie O. Beecher; his mother, Mrs. Annie Beecher; another son, Riney Jr., and a brother, Paul, of St. Louis.\n\nFuneral services at 4 p.m. Wednesday will be held from the home. Rev. F. M. Johnson and Rev. T. J. Windham will conduct them. Interment will take place in the Evergreen cemetery with Wall & Stabe directing. Members of the fire department will attend the final rites for their comrade in a body."
