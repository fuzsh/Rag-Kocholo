        "text": "JOAN OSBORN HUFFMAN #1>”JODIE” Born January 7, 1926 to Ethel Warner Osborn and John Paul Osborn of Baraboo, Wisconsin, Jodie passed away January 12, 2006 leaving behind family and friends that miss her terribly. Jodie was raised in Baraboo and maintained contact with her high school friends through correspondence and by attending nearly all of her class reunions. The family loved vacations spent at Devil’s Lake. Baraboo always held a special place in her heart. After marrying Charles Edwin Huffman, they moved to Ohio and Jodie stayed home to raise daughters Leslie (Raymond), the twins; Sherry (Kopack) and Carla (Sikinger), and Kim (Hay). The youngest, Kurt Charles was born in California after moving to Topanga Canyon in 1960. The mountains of Topanga were a great place for kids to romp and many friendships were kindled there. Jodie j oined the work force with a job in the personnel department of Santa Monica City Hall. She joked that she wished she could introduce her daughters to some of the cute guys she interviewed to become city lifeguards. In 1969 Jodie began working for the Guidance and Control department of Litton Industries in Woodland Hills. She made many friends there with whom she maintained contact after retiring in 1992. Family and friends were most important to Jodie. She loved get-togethers to exchange differe nt ideas and to laugh! She once dumped half-a-bottle of champagne on a son-in-law for a teasing remark he made. Laughing and running away she yelled, “I feel so powerful!” We’ll always feel your power, Jodie. In lieu of flowers please make a donation to the Salvation Army or to the Al Ringling Theater, 136 4th Ave., Baraboo, WI 53913. Anyone connected to Baraboo is also connected to the Ringling Brothers/Barnum & Bailey Circus where they wintered for a time. Family members may be contacted re garding a celebration of life in Calabasas on February 19th. For information please call Jennifer at the Neptune Society 818-845-2415"
