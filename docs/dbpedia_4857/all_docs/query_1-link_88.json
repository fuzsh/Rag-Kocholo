        "text": "As noted in other updates, floor action in the House and Senate is ramping up as committees are in their final weeks of hearing their own chambers’ bills (e.g., House committees hearing House bills). Bills that have not at least cleared a committee by this time will soon be running into deadlines that will eliminate their chances of passage.\n\nWe have noted some major bills that were considered on the floor this week (in particular, the House school safety bills and the teacher retention bills but several more education bills were considered on the House or Senate floor this week. Note that this is not a complete list of education bills that have passed.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, these bills must still go through the other chamber’s committee process and floor action before heading to the governor’s desk.\n\nHouse floor\n\nThe only bill on this list that did not pass, HB 772 by Rep. Alma Allen would have prohibited corporal punishment in Texas public schools. It failed on a vote of 58-86.\n\nHB 2929 by Rep. JM Lozano is a bill that TCTA worked on extensively. It includes “clean-up” provisions for last session’s bill that reduced training requirements for teachers, in which TCTA had taken a leading role.\n\nSB 30 by Sen. Joan Huffman is the supplemental appropriations bill that revises budget expenditures for the current fiscal year (the main budget bill concerns the upcoming biennium). Having passed both the House and Senate in different forms, SB 30 will now go to a conference committee. Among the differences that the conference committee must address is the matter of funding for retiree benefit increases. The Senate proposes to partially fund its proposed increases with $1 billion in current-year funding, while the House is relying on funding in the main budget that also includes contribution increases by the state and active members.\n\nHB 63 by Rep. Valoree Swanson is a bill that TCTA has been concerned about as it will eliminate the ability of teachers and other “mandated reporters” (professionals who are required under law to report suspected child abuse or neglect) to file reports anonymously. The bill attempts to alleviate concerns by specifying the limited individuals who would have access to the name and contact information of the person filing the report, but TCTA and other groups remain concerned that the legislation will have a chilling effect on reporting.\n\nHB 964 by Rep. Jacey Jetton would add the offense of an inappropriate educator relationship with a student to the list of offenses requiring sex offender registration.\n\nHB 98 by Rep. Joe Moody would authorize districts to contract with a local mental health authority to provide mental health services on campuses, and would require the Health and Human Services Commission to allow districts to enroll as Medicaid providers and receive reimbursement for the provision of such services.\n\nHB 185 by Rep. Mary Gonzalez would require districts and charters to report through PEIMS the number of chronically absent students enrolled at each campus.\n\nSCR 28 by Sen. Joan Huffman (companion of HCR 20 by Rep. Abel Herrero) is headed to the governor’s desk. While not requiring congressional action, it is an expression of the Texas Legislature’s support for the repeal of the two provisions of federal law that affect Social Security benefits for Texas school employees — the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO).\n\nHB 3803 by Rep. Charles Cunningham would allow parents of students in grades 4-8 to have their child repeat a grade.\n\nHB 2209 by Rep. Lozano creates the Rural Pathway Excellence Partnership (R-PEP) program to support multi-district partnerships to expand opportunities for underserved students to succeed while also promoting economic development in rural areas.\n\nSenate floor"
