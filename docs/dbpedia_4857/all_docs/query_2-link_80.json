She serves as chairwoman of the Texas Senate Republican Caucus, vice chairwoman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, and is also a member of the Finance, State Affairs, and Health and Human Services Committees.\n\nDistrict 17 is comprised of areas in Fort Bend, Brazoria and Harris counties. The term length for State Senators is two or four years with no term limits.\n\nAll results are unofficial until canvassed."
