        "text": "Last week, Senator Joan Huffman (R - Houston) filed Senate Bill 923.\n\nSB 923 requires that persons employed at a sexually oriented business to be at least 21, or those businesses can face criminal and civil penalties.\n\nAdditionally, SB 923 provides administrative and civil penalties for sexually oriented businesses who allow persons younger than 18 years old on their premises.\n\nâTexas must be ready to do everything in its power to eliminate human trafficking and to protect vulnerable young people,â said Senator Huffman.\n\nâThis includes prohibiting persons under 21 to work in sexually oriented businesses, so that we can encourage the maturity and awareness that must be required for this kind of employment. Further, sexually oriented businesses that cater to children must be shut down immediately.â\n\nâI applaud Senator Huffman for her proactive leadership and her dedication to keeping young Texans safe,â said Governor Abbott.\n\nâBy protecting these young people from the risks associated with sexually oriented businesses, we will continue to make important strides in the fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation. I look forward to working with Senator Huffman and the legislature to ensure a safer future for all Texans.â\n\nSenate Bill 923 provides that it is a common nuisance for sexually oriented businesses to allow persons younger than 18 on the premises or to employ persons younger than 21 years old, creates administrative penalties for sexually oriented businesses who knowingly or recklessly allow persons younger than 18 on their premises, and attaches a criminal penalty to sexually oriented businesses employing an individual under 21 years old.\n\n(Huffman represents District 17, which includes portions of Brazoria, Fort Bend and Harris counties. Huffman currently serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on State Affairs, Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Administration, and as a member of the Legislative Budget Board. Huffman and her family reside in Houston.)"
