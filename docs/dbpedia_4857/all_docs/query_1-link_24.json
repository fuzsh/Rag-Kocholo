        "text": "Senator Joan Huffman's tenure in the Texas Senate has been characterized by strong conservative leadership on criminal justice, fiscal responsibility, economic development and crucial issues impacting children's health and education. Huffman was elected in 2008 and has been re-elected twice. She represents District 17, which comprises Brazoria, Fort Bend and Harris counties.\n\nHuffman serves as vice chairwoman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee and is a member of the Finance, State Affairs and Health and Human Services Committees. In addition, she serves as chairwoman of the Senate Republican Caucus and is on the Legislative Leaders Advisory Board of the national organization GOPAC.\n\nReflecting a commitment to law and order, Huffman has successfully championed numerous bills strengthening the criminal justice system and protecting children from sexual assault and abuse.\n\nIn addition to all her other duties, Huffman is an appointed Ex-Officio member of the Governor's Criminal Justice Advisory Council. It advises Governor Perry on the operations and performance of specialty courts to ensure the rights of participants are protected.\n\nHuffman's work on criminal justice issues has been recognized by the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, which has given her its Law and Order award the past two legislative sessions. She's the only repeat recipient in the history of the association's award. Huffman's dedication and service to the most vulnerable Texans has earned her the Patient Care Champion award from the Harris County Medical Society for three straight sessions. The Texas Conservative Coalition named her a Courageous Conservative for her voting record during the 83rd legislative session, and she was also recipient of the Texas Conservative Roundtable's Lone Star Conservative Leader award.\n\nSenator Huffman lives with her family in Houston. She continues to serve her constituents and all of Texas as a committed conservative with an independent voice they can trust. Find her on Facebook and follow her on Twitter @joanhuffman."
