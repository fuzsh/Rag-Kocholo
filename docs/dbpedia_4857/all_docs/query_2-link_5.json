        "text": "Senator Joan Huffman is a respected, proven leader for our shared conservative values. As our State Senator, Joan Huffman has made historic strides to secure our borders, stop election fraud, protect innocent life, keep our neighborhoods safe, and safeguard the Second Amendment.\n\nJoan Huffman has dedicated her life to upholding the rule of law and protecting our families, first as a Harris County prosecutor and a Criminal District Court Judge, and now as an effective voice in the Texas Senate. A tireless supporter of our law enforcement officers, Senator Huffman fought back against radical efforts to defund the police. Senator Huffman led the fight to pass critical bail reform legislation to stop soft-on-crime judges from releasing violent criminals back on our streets. She also passed a bill that allows for the removal of a prosecutor if they refuse to uphold the law.\n\nSenator Huffman strongly supports securing our borders and respecting the rule of law. The Biden administration’s dangerous open border policies have created a crisis that is ruining lives, devastating communities, and destroying property. That’s why Senator Huffman stepped up and invested over $5 billion in additional funding for border security, including funds to build a border barrier over land and water to protect our state from human traffickers and drug cartels.\n\nSecure elections are the cornerstone of our democratic Republic. For this reason, Senator\n\nHuffman passed commonsense election reforms like Voter ID that make it easy to vote and hard to cheat. There should be no doubt that our elections are fair and secure.\n\nFamilies and businesses are moving to Texas by the thousands because we have an economic environment that encourages innovation and job creation. In the Texas Senate, Joan Huffman has passed balanced state budgets that cut wasteful spending and lowered taxes for Texas families and businesses. Joan Huffman will keep taxes low, regulations reasonable, and our legal system fair so that Texas can remain the strongest economic and job growth state in America.\n\nAs your State Senator, Joan Huffman will continue working to keep Texas as the preeminent state in our nation for generations to come."
