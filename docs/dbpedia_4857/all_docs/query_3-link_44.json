        "text": "Peggy Joan Huffman OBITUARY\n\nPeggy Joan Huffman of Glenmoore Peggy Joan (Ellis) Huffman, 67, of Glenmoore, passed away on Tuesday, May 21, 2013, at Paoli Hospital after a long courageous battle with metastatic breast cancer. Peggy was born Aug. 31, 1945, in Battle Creek, Mich., the second daughter of Marvin and Althea (Kneebone) Ellis. Peggy received her B. A. degree in English from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1967. She then earned her MLS degree in 1978 from the University of Maryland, College Park. Peggy taught in the Grand Island and Bellevue Public Schools in Nebraska, the Wake Co./Raleigh City Schools in North Carolina, the Prince Georges Co. Schools in Maryland, the Steilacoom Public Schools in Washington and retired in 2010 from Downingtown Area Schools, Downingtown. She married Melvin Eugene Huffman in Capehart Chapel, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, on June 12, 1971. Their marriage of nearly 42 years and Geneâ€™s military career took them from coast to coast. Peggy and Gene moved to Glenmoore, Chester Co. in March of 1986 when Gene retired from USAF. They soon joined the Glenmoore United Methodist Church where both have been very active. Peggy served in many capacities, including singing in the choir, teaching Sunday school and Vacation Bible School, and serving in the church library and on various church committees. A few of her favorite projects with United Methodist Women were the Cookie Walk & Craft Bazaar, bake sales and serving as treasurer. Together she and Gene have enjoyed many years of Glenmoore UM Easter egg making. In addition to church work, Peggy served the community in her work with Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts of America. Her hobbies included reading, ceramics, cross-stitch, travel, watching movies, collecting cardinals and most of all, visiting her grandchildren. Peggy was preceded in death by her father and infant son, Paul. She is survived by her husband and her mother; one son, Michael Melvin (Shannon) Huffman of Phoenixville; one daughter, Katherine Elizabeth Huffman of Athens, Ga.; one granddaughter, Meghan Rose Huffman and one grandson, Zachary Michael Huffman, both of Phoenixville; three sisters, Susan Ellis, Mary (Jim) Mather and Debra (Jim) Kula of Nebraska; and one sister-in-law, Marcia (Rodney) Smith of Ohio; as well as several nieces and nephews, Kara, Reed and Morgan Hanes; Nate ( Emily) Adelyn and Elleigh Smith, all of Ohio; and DeeCee Mather, Amy and John Kula of Nebraska. A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, May 25, from the Glenmoore United Methodist Church, 1920 Creek Road, Glenmoore, with Pastors Ralph Cain, Jr. and Barbara Emery officiating. Interment will follow at the church cemetery. Family and friends may call from 9 to 10:50 a.m. on Saturday at the church. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Cancer Society, 1626 Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103 or to Glenmoore United Methodist Church, PO Box 37, Glenmoore, PA 19343-0037.
