        "text": "Richard Edward Huffman passed peacefully into eternal life on March 21, 2023 at OSF Sacred Heart Medical Center in Danville, IL at the age of 88. He was the son of Forrest Levi (Jake) Huffman and Luciene Rosalene (Claypool) Huffman. His paternal grandparents were Charles Scott Leonard Huffman and Maria Jane Huffman. His maternal grandparents were David Ira Claypool and Addie Josephine (White) Claypool.\n\nRichard was born October 19, 1934 in Blount Township in Vermilion County, Illinois. He grew up in that area and attended Henning schools, attending Milner’s 1-room grade School and graduating from Henning High School in 1952. After graduation he attended machinist school at Caterpillar in Peoria, Illinois. He next took a position at Consolidated Products in Danville, leaving there to sell MoorMan’s Animal Feed and to become a bus driver for the Bismarck School District. He was drafted for the Korean Conflict in 1956, but received a deferral due to his impending fatherhood. He then took a job at Hyster where he remained for 12 years.\n\nHis first great adventure took place in 1970 when he started Sunnyside Farms. He built an egg operation with a 15,000 capacity chicken house and began providing eggs to grocery stores and restaurants throughout West Central Indiana and East Central Illinois. He employed many local people and several of those have related the amazing, smelly, crazy times they had as teenagers installing or removing 15,000 chickens when a flock was changed over.\n\nNext up was his business as a Case Lawn mower dealer. He enjoyed both the personal and mechanical challenges that brought. He loved solving problems and this gave him ample opportunities.\n\nHis final career was as a hot shot delivery driver, first for Roberts Express and then for Federal Express. This involved him and wife Lois going over the road in a large straight truck delivering urgent loads throughout the US and Canada. He and Lois had always wanted to travel the US and this way they got to do it - and got paid to do it. They had many fun times seeing the US. They especially enjoyed visiting with far flung relatives and friends along their travels.\n\nRichard was a lifelong member of Old Union Church of Christ, later Crossroads Christian Church, serving as youth sponsor, deacon, Sunday school superintendent and Mission Committee chairman. He worked countless hours on building projects at both locations.\n\nWatching basketball in person or on TV was both pleasure and pain for Rich. He was a basketball and baseball player at Henning High School. He also loved watching and reading about history. He spent many hours in his machine shop at Sunnyside Farm.\n\nRichard married Lois June Ingalsbe on April 3, 1955. They had 63 years together as partners in life, love, and business until she was called to Heaven on February 28, 2018. They had five children together: Myra Gail (Frank) Fasullo, Mary Jane (Mark) McBride, David Alfred (Kathleen Gigax) Huffman, Charles (Shirley ‘Judene’ Harmon) Huffman, and Rick Everett (Jennifer Steinbaugh) Huffman.\n\nThey provided him with thirteen grandchildren. Myra’s children: Lillie Fasullo (Tyler) Brannen, Francesca (Jackson Fisher) Fasullo, Rosemary (Zachary) Aamold Fasullo. Mary’s children: Zachary (Jessie Vandevender) McBride, Noah (Destini Mink), Juliet, Victoria, and Braxton McBride. David’s son, Benjamin Huffman. Charles’s children: Warren Tamagri, Kelsey (Lucas) Shuman, and Jodi (Franklin) Tamagri Haley. Rick’s son, Riker Huffman.\n\nRichard had 5 sweet great grandbabies; Lillie’s children: Ruby, Alice, and Piper Brannen. Jodi’s children: Samantha O’Brien and Charlie Haley. He delighted in them.\n\nRich is survived by his brother, John (Marie) Huffman, sister-in-law Joan Huffman, sister-in-law Beulah (Wayne) Smith, and brother-in-law Harold (Trudy) Ingalsbe. He is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nAfter Lois’s passing, Richard was fortunate to have a very special friend and companion in Dorothy Goodner. Dorothy brought Richard’s whistle back. Dorothy was his support every step of his journey and he was very fond of her. His family would like to express their sincere appreciation for her kindness and friendship.\n\nRichard was preceded in death by his grandparents, parents, infant sister Shirley, brother Melvin David Huffman, son-in-law, Mark McBride, sister-in-law Janet (Ingalsbe) Hudson and her husband Hal, brother-in-law Ervin Ingalsbe and his wife Clara.\n\nA Celebration of Richard’s life will be held at 10:00 AM Monday, March 27, 2023 at Sunset Funeral Home and Cremation Center, 3940 N Vermilion Street in Danville, IL. Paul Ziebart will officiate. Burial will be in Sunset Memorial Park. Visitation will be held on Sunday, March 26, 2023 from 2:00 to 4:00 PM at the funeral home.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to one of Richard’s favorite organizations: Crossroads Christian Church’s Missions (crossroadsofdanville.com) or Heifer International (heifer.org).\n\nPlease join Richard’s family in sharing memories, photos, and videos on his tribute wall at www.sunsetfuneralhome.com."
