        "text": "Synopsis\n\nRavish Kumar, is NDTV India's senior executive editor is one of India's most influential TV journalists.\n\nMANILA: Senior Indian journalist Ravish Kumar on Friday was awarded this year's Ramon Magsaysay Award, regarded as the Asian version of the Nobel Prize.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nKumar, 44, who is NDTV India's senior executive editor is one of India's most influential TV journalists, the award citation by the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation said.\n\nHe is among five individuals who were declared winners of the award, which is Asia's premier prize and highest honour and celebrates greatness of spirit and transformative leadership in Asia.\n\nKumar, born in Jitwarpur village in Bihar, joined New Delhi Television Network (NDTV) in 1996 and worked his way up from being a field reporter.\n\nAfter NDTV launched its 24-hour Hindi-language news channel - NDTV India - targeting the country's 422 million native speakers of Hindi, he was given his own daily show, \"Prime Time.\"\n\nKumar's \"Prime Time\" programme \"deals with real-life, under-reported problems of ordinary people\", it added.\n\n\"If you have become the voice of the people, you are a journalist,\" the citation added.\n\nAs an anchor, Kumar is sober, incisive, and well-informed, it said.\n\nHis more important distinction, however, comes from the kind of journalism he represents, the citation added.\n\n\"In a media environment threatened by an interventionist state, toxic with jingoist partisans, trolls and purveyors of 'fake news,' and where the competition for market ratings has put the premium on 'media personalities,' 'tabloidisation,' and audience-pandering sensationalism, Ravish has been most vocal on insisting that the professional values of sober, balanced, fact-based reporting be upheld in practice,\" it said.\n\nHis programme takes up current social issues; does serious background research; and presents issues in well-rounded discussions.\n\nKumar interacts easily with the poor, travels extensively, and uses social media to stay in touch with the audience, generating from them the stories for the programme.\n\nStriving for a people-based journalism, he calls his newsroom \"the people's newsroom,\" it said.\n\nIn electing Kumar to receive the 2019 Ramon Magsaysay Award, the board of trustees recognises his unfaltering commitment to a professional, ethical journalism of the highest standards; his moral courage in standing up for truth, integrity, and independence; and his principled belief that it is in giving full and respectful voice to the voiceless, in speaking truth bravely yet soberly to power, that journalism fulfills its noblest aims to advance democracy, the award citation said.\n\nThe four other winners of the 2019 Ramon Magsaysay Award are Ko Swe Win from Myanmar, Angkhana Neelapaijit from Thailand, Raymundo Pujante Cayabyab from Philippines and Kim Jong-Ki from South Korea.\n\nEstablished in 1957, the Ramon Magsaysay Award is Asia's highest honour.\n\nIt celebrates the memory and leadership example of the third Philippine president after whom the award is named, and is given every year to individuals or organisations in Asia who manifest the same selfless service and transformative influence that ruled the life of the late and beloved Filipino leader.\n\nThis year's Magsaysay Award winners will each receive a certificate and a medallion with an embossed image of Ramon Magsaysay facing right in profile. They will be formally conferred the Magsaysay Award during formal presentation ceremonies to be held on August 31, 2019.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nEconomic Survey’s plan to drop food from inflation targeting is a bad idea\n\nDollar bear cycle may fuel emerging markets rally till 2029: Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
