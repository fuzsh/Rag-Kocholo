Vol. 2, No. 3, pp. 48–73 The role of a song in a Hindi film Rajiv Vijayakar Film critic and Mumbai Correspondent of India-West (USA), rajivvijayakar@gmail.com The article will explore the role of the ‘Film Song’ in the life and popularity of a Hindi film and study its unique narrative attributes and purpose vis-à-vis songs in other world cinemas. The Hindi film song has been an integral and integrated part of a Hindi film’s script. It not only exists in a musical Hindi movie but is also used as a narrative device in films of every genre from comedies and romances to crime thrillers and horror films, most of which, routinely, may have five or more songs. The lyrics of songs are used to convey progressions in sequence and character moods much more succinctly than volumes of dialogues and visual sequences, accompanied by vocal music backed by an appropriate orchestral tenor in both popular and art-house Hindi movies. Though this may seem unreal to a viewer from another culture, it is not so for the traditional Hindi film audience as the format and presence of a song in a celluloid narrative traces its roots to ancient Indian folk theatre (called Nautanki) and age-old storytelling traditions. The article, while providing a historical perspective to the origin of the Hindi film song, will introduce readers to some of the greatest legends of Hindi cinema’s music- making industry that enjoys an independent life of its own, often much beyond its source films’ run and popularity. It will explain the role of the primary collaborators involved in the making of a Hindi film song, and discuss the structure, functions and integral narrative duties of a good film song for a fair appraisal of its existence. Stand out examples of songs from the 84-year-old journey of the Hindi film song will be used to argue why it should be appreciated as one of the most crucial forms of Indian popular culture. www.southasianist.ed.ac.uk | ISSN 2050-487X | pg. 49\n\n3.

In Hindi films, however, the fourth but very vital element is the accompanying situation in the script, which results in the visuals. This, in Hindi film parlance, is termed as ‘picturisation’ (conversion into a picture!). In most such songs, as said earlier, there is a www.southasianist.ed.ac.uk | ISSN 2050-487X | pg. 53\n\n7. a single music director entity usually composes all the songs in a film. We used the term ‘entity’ because over the decades, composer duos have been a tradition in Hindi films, with over a dozen well-known entities beginning with Husnlal-Bhagatram in the 1940s. In the late 1990s, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy became the first and so far only trio.

Beginning with A.R. Rahman, a lot of the younger composers also participated in most or even all departments of song making. In Hindi movies, a soundtrack is branded as a composer’s handiwork, more than that of any of its other collaborators. It is he who gets both the bouquets when it is appreciated and the brickbats if it disappoints. This is also because www.southasianist.ed.ac.uk The Lyricist Some of the finest lyrics in India have been written for Indian film songs.

The Structure of The Hindi Film Song The overwhelming majority of Hindi film songs have a classic mukhada-antara structure common to Indian music even in the non-film segment. The mukhada is the main thought of a song, encapsulating the essence of what is being conveyed. It may be one, two or more lines long. It is generally repeated at intervals after each antara, usually with either the first line or in its entirety. The antara is the body of the lyric, the stanza that expounds on the thought in the mukhada. The word mukhada literally means Figures 12 & 13: Shreya Ghoshal (previous page) and Sunidhi Chauhan (above) are leading female playback singers since 2005 ‘countenance’ and antara refers to what is within. Most film songs have at least two antaras, though they may go as high as four, and, rarely, even more. Good lyricists always maintain an ascending graph in the successive antaras, giving the song a narrative feel where the greatest punch comes in the end.. The rhyming patterns of the mukhada and the antara vary, while the connecting portion where the antara goes back to a repeat of the mukhada is called – the ‘cross-line’. The crossline usually rhymes with at least one line in the mukhada. As an archetypal example, here is the first stanza of a classic song, written by Shakeel Figure 14: Sonu Nigam, a popular post 90s’ singer, has also cut a tribute album, Rafi Resurrected, with The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) www.southasianist.ed.ac.uk Badayuni, composed by Ravi and sung by Mohammed Rafi for actor Guru Dutt in the | ISSN 2050-487X | pg. 62\n\n16. 1960 film Chaudhvin Ka Chand4 (The Translation: Crescent Mooned Beauty) wherein the lover You are the wine that contains goes into raptures about his beloved’s beauty.

Multiple composers in a film, re-creations of old melodies and even songs from non-film creators like pop and folk musicians dabbling in movie music became common.
