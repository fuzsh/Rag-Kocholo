        "text": "It’s August 29 and I would like to start this day with this small expression of gratitude to celebrate my 10 years of Industry Experience exclusively on the SAP world and honor my wonderful Colleagues, Managers, Mentors and Well Wishers who had selflessly supported me in this long journey.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nLet me start with this small story of where and how this journey had started. For the first time, I stepped into SAP Labs Bangalore campus on August 22nd, 2011, for my fourth round of interview after I had cleared the first three rounds in Chennai (city where I did my graduation) through an off-campus interview process by a consultancy. Anyone who had visited SAP Labs Bangalore campus would certainly admit, that SAP Labs Bangalore campus is the best place, one could ever imagine to work with especially right after graduation. Afterall for an average student who graduated from a below average college like me, it’s a dream come true to even get selected for an Interview. I hardly noticed the beauty of this campus as I walked towards BLR04 (block where my interview was scheduled) because I was completely nervous. On the contrary the return was the longest stroll I ever had and have in my memory till today as it was full of joy, pride, and excitement that I finally did it after six rounds of interview! I met two of my amazing colleagues (Kavitha Rajamani and Manjunath Gopadi) who had interviewed me and later became one of my well-wishers and good friend (little that I know this relationship would continue even after 10 years to guide me to take important career decisions) and the best Manager I have ever worked with till today. I joined SAP Labs in the next one week on August 29th, 2011.\n\nPart 1: 2011–2014\n\nI had a wonderful on-boarding to the Teams and worked closely with Kavitha, the architect who had interviewed me. Kavitha made sure, that I literally operated the next 6-7 months only outside my comfort zone on an exciting challenge for SAP CRM in ABAP right from ideation. The best thing that could happen for one who wishes to grow far in career, is to work with a tough leader. I am lucky that it happened to me from the day one till today. I still remember the day (Feb 08, 2012) when my delivery manager Neetha John demoed this solution during an offsite in Walldorf and received an appreciation for all our contributions. As I was completing my first 9 months, my then manager Manju called me and said that he had recommended me a salary hike and it was an exceptional scenario that he had done something like this for a beginner that early. It’s not just the monetary appreciation but the feedback and guidance that I received from Manju, still makes me feel that he is the best Manager that I have ever worked with. The two books which he gifted me ‘Winning’ by Jack Welch & ‘The best thing about you is you’ by Anupham Kher had profound influence on my early growth. Thank you Kavitha, Manju and Neetha for your trust and giving me the best start that I could ever imagine for my career and ‘life’. I am always grateful for your trust and support.\n\nI had joined SAP originally as a Contractor (C-User) from a consultancy who had initially conducted the interview process in Chennai. At that time, C-Users were only offered Desktop at office location, but my next Manager Ranjeetha Raja went through another exceptional process to offer me a company laptop and datacard so I could continue to work from anywhere I want. My first Work from Home was made possible back in 2013 (Feb 28, 2013, to be precise ;-)). Thanks, Ranjeetha for making me feel special and taking care to ensure that I wasn’t treated differently than any other SAP Internal employees.\n\nOver time my love and desire to strengthen my relationship with SAP grew exponentially fast and led to a disappointment when I learned certain framework conditions that the C-Users are bound to. Finally, with a heavy heart I decided to move out of my contract hoping that things will fall back in place soon as I wished. It was certainly a difficult moment to walk out of the campus on May 31st, 2014. But God had his own plans which brought me back to SAP exactly in the next 365 days on June 1st, 2015, but with a twist.\n\nPart 2: 2014–2018\n\nI joined as SAP Technology Consultant with Exa AG India (a division of Walldorf based start-up on SAP space), where I met few more amazing colleagues like Jemin Tanna, Srikanth Krishnaswamy, Prashant Nirmale and Oliver Merten. Jemin and Srikanth who interviewed me and as well supported me during my initial days at Exa from a Technical and HR perspective. Thanks a lot, Jemin and Srikanth. Prashant who was then Head of Exa AG India, did a final call on my interview, and as well later supported me as a Supervisor for my Master Thesis. Thanks Prashant. In the next few weeks, I was back again as C-User to SAP for a project which Exa worked in a close collaboration together with SAP Labs Bangalore. It was the time that I have had the wonderful opportunity to work directly on a customer implementation project for Asian Paints and few others. After few months, Asian Paints had received the highest honor ‘SAP Innovation Award for best implementation on SAP HANA’ for the project that I contributed to. Within a year, my German Manager Oliver offered me a 7-month contract position in Walldorf. Thanks a lot Oliver for all your guidance and the opportunity to begin my career here in Germany. I had my first Air travel both domestic and international because of Exa. Exa had provided the best launch for me and many other SAP Consultants. Thanks a lot, Exa AG for everything. I had ended my association with Exa AG India on May 31st, 2015, and joined Exa AG Germany on June 1st, 2015, as deputation to SAP SE. I began my journey as a C-User again to SAP but this time, it’s SAP SE, in the Walldorf Headquarter. Now you know that twist.\n\nI worked on SAP Healthcare project for the next 7 months where I met Stefan Scheidl who was my SAP Manager for the project. What more I can ask for, when I and Stefan discussed just few days before I was flying back to India, he was ready to offer me a full-time permanent position with SAP SE. Honestly this was the moment I was waiting for since my first step into SAP Labs campus back in 2011. But not even in my wild dreams, I was prepared that my full-time direct employment with SAP would ever happen in SAP SE Headquarters. I had to make some compromises but that really doesn’t matter, there would always be a trade-off to be made in life. There is no perfect happiness, God has his own plans, just do your hard work and you will be offered whatever you rightly deserve. I am grateful for what I was offered. It was as well not an easy hire for Stefan. He had to go through an exceptional process (I know I had used this term multiple times, but I need to make this explicit to emphasize the fact that everyone around me went an extra mile to support me) to hire a non-internal-non-SAP foreign candidate for the Germany open position. Early 2016, I relocated with my family to Germany permanently and joined SAP SE officially. Stefan supported me immensely towards my career growth as my manager during the next 3 years. Thanks a ton Stefan, I am extremely grateful to you for all the support you offered me.\n\nPart 3: 2019–2021\n\nMy next managers were Biju Balachandran and Uwe Langendoerfer, with whom I worked for the next 2.5 years. With Uwe, though our relationship was rather short, I have evidently seen his efforts to support me at instances given the limits of external factors and boundary conditions. I could have only wished for better weather conditions ;-) nevertheless I am grateful for every effort that I have evidently seen and apologize for any that I missed. Thanks a lot for your patience Uwe. Biju is special, Biju entered my career life for the second time. The first interaction was known very little to each of us as one of my good friends had referred me to Biju back in 2014 (while Biju was part of his previous organization) just before I decided to leave SAP Labs Bangalore.\n\nBiju was not just a manager but as well a good mentor. During the following two and half years, that I worked with Biju, I had learned a lot of leadership qualities from him both actively and passively. I worked under Biju during the tough external situations like the onset of covid pandemic and the internal transformations that I went through from being an individual contributor towards taking up a lead role. Biju had always set the bar high towards me. Biju ensured that I as an aspiring Leader, learned first-hand to lead without formal authority, to own my mistakes, to feel accountable not just for my actions but for the collective results of the team that I led. Despite the tough evaluations, Stefan, Uwe, and Biju all of them also made me feel recognized by consistently awarding me ‘SAP Catalyst’ for all 5 years in a row towards my contributions to various Healthcare topics. My days were filled with accepting the recognitions and challenging the status quos. I would even call it, the closest ever that I had been to a Leadership Program is through Biju’s guidance and his school of thoughts. Thank you in words is certainly not sufficient but still Thanks a lot Biju and I can only give back that gratitude towards you completely by my own actions. I owe you to prove how powerful your advice is and even your single ‘No’ could be.\n\nRecently my current manager Monika Niederhoff, not knowing me before but still had fully trusted me and empowered me towards a bigger mission when I was looking for an opportunity to challenge myself with additional responsibility and move more closer towards Technology and Innovation especially after 6 long years stint at Healthcare LoB. Monika, I am absolutely geared up for the best part of my career to unfold and looking forward to contributing towards BTP and writing the success story of our foundation together. Thanks again for your trust in onboarding me to your Leadership team.\n\nSpecial Mention:\n\nMy source of Inspiration – Ferose VR. Unfortunately, I had not worked with him officially. But I am huge fan of Ferose for his thoughts, his speeches, and his work. Ferose was the Managing Director of SAP Labs India and recognized as the Young Global Leader by World Economic Forum. I met Ferose for the first time in SAP Labs Bangalore on Oct 14, 2011, when he delivered his Keynote for the event Co-Delight (my first SAP Innovation Hackathon). Since then, I tried my best to be in touch with Ferose consistently (the most surprising part is, he repeated the same – heights of his humbleness), followed his speeches through various mediums and gained great wisdom passively. I am lucky today, that I get to talk to Ferose virtually anytime, meet him every time he visits Walldorf (Ferose is part of SAP America and settled in Palo Alto now) and receive his advice and ask his opinions for any matter. By the way, the cover picture here is from one of the best books ‘Highway Dharma Letters’ which Ferose gifted me. Thank you Ferose for being an inspiration to me and many others. You are always a role model for me.\n\nLast but not least, I have had the opportunity to work with very supportive, extremely talented and committed colleagues on this journey. I didn’t want to name one or two and miss other, rather I would give a big shout out to all my colleagues and convey my thanks to each one of them. It was only because of their support, patience, and feedback, I was able to acquire new technical skills, experiment with my operating style and continuously pivot myself to grow towards the lead role. My journey wouldn’t have been fun without their presence. I am glad, some of my colleagues whom I met since 2011 have had turned good friends forever despite the distance and time zone difference. I know it sounds cliché, but still Thanks a lot guys (Santhosh, Madhu, Sreejith, Ravi, Venkatesh, Krithika, Sagar, Suvarna, Senthil, Avinash, Boopalan, Karthik, Poonam, Shreyansh, Markus, Christian, Christoph, Monika.P, Naurin, Sanjitha, Michael.Z, Praneeth, Sudeep, Prasad) for the pleasant memories and continued Friendship. Hope I didn’t miss anyone, if so please excuse.\n\nSummary:\n\nLooking back at the last 10 years, it was certainly not an easy walk on the park. I had several challenges, starting from being an average graduate to get selected for SAP out of 1000+ off-campus applicants to constant fight for one right employment that I truly deserved till moving my career one step at a time towards my aspirations. But it became possible only due to the support and guidance of amazing people whom I met in my career. More than being proud of my badges (titles, projects, etc.) that I earned, I am proud of earning the trust of so many colleagues (who turned good friends, well-wishers, and mentors for life). I had equally good and bad days both personally and professionally, but I always had my well-wishers and mentors beside me every time. My Career growth would not have been possible otherwise. I am sincerely thankful to each one of them from bottom of my heart. Not to forget, I could meet all these wonderful people in my life only because of SAP. For some SAP is an employer, for most SAP is the best workplace, but for me SAP is my home and much more beyond. When I got my job at SAP in 2011, I didn’t just earn money but my own Identity, self-respect, recognition, and financial independence. SAP will always be at the center of my heart and thoughts. My contribution and loyalty to SAP will continue for many more decades to come and hopefully forever.\n\nThanks again Kavitha, Manju, Neetha, Ranjeetha, Jemin, Srikanth, Prashant, Oliver, ExaAG, Stefan, Uwe, Biju, Monika, Ferose, SAP, and my SAP Colleagues. I tried to capture our interactions correctly to the best of my knowledge, apologize if I had made some mistakes (would be a good opportunity to reconnect ;-)).\n\n#lifeatSAP (Two beautiful campus that I was/am part of. Truth to be told, I love working from office location than being at my home office :-))"
