        "text": "Voting Rules\n\nAll people who have been in Google Doodles, listed by most recent.\n\nWho are the most influential people in history? Here's a good place to start. This is a list of every person who has ever been immortalized in a Google Doodle, in order from the very first to the most recent. The first Google Doodle appeared on on August 30, 1998, in honor of Burning Man, surprising visitors to the search engine homepage. It wasn't until 2001 that the very first real person was commemorated. In November of that year, a Google Doodle honored Claude Monet, artistically drawn in the style of the painter's famous water lilies. For more than a decade since, Google has celebrated artists, inventors, poets, musicians, activists, mathematicians, scientists, singers, architects, and hundreds of other people who have made positive contributions to the world as we know it. Every famous person who has been in a Google Doodle is listed in the order in which his or her Doodle appeared on the famous website, along with the date—or multiple dates, when applicable. While most of these cool and interesting people were honored on their birthdays, many others have been recognized on important anniversaries of their work. There is also a picture of each person's Google Doodle, and videos for important men and women like Freddie Mercury, Jules Verne, and Maya Angelou, whose Doodles were interactive.\n\n1376\n\nMar 16, 2022\n\nRosa Bonheur, born Marie-Rosalie Bonheur, (16 March 1822 – 25 May 1899) was a French artist, an animalière (painter of animals) and sculptor, known for her artistic realism.
