        "text": "Procedure Followed in Decision Making Process\n\n[Section-4 (1) (b) (iii)]\n\nDecision-making in law enforcement is as dynamic as the profession and there is no single process that will work in all situations. The course of action undertaken by an officer involved in a critical incident must be made quickly, under pressure, and often in isolation.\n\nLine-level decisions are made instinctually, based on the individual’s training and experience. Decisions made by command-level officers, on the other hand, are more apt to be made in a collaborative environment, after extensive research, and under flexible deadlines. These decisions are contemplative and draw upon the individual’s education and experience. Whether the decision is made to quell a crisis or serve an administrative function, the immediate and long-term repercussions of these decisions can reverberate throughout the community the officer serves, as well as the agency in which he or she works. Law enforcement professionals have an enormous responsibility and obligation to make ethical, legal and knowledgeable choices that safeguard the public’s trust in our abilities to establish law and order in our communities.\n\nPolice officers and administrators are called upon to make myriad decisions each and every day of their careers. Whether made individually or collaboratively, the best decisions often start in the heart, process through the mind, and fulfill a vision. Education, training, ethical motivations, liability, precedent—all these aspects are consciously or unconsciously considered during the decision-making process. Open communication, trusted advisors and knowing that even an honest mistake can be defended and changed leads to an environment where people feel comfortable deviating from the “Yes Man” mentality and offer true and valuable input into a decision-making process."
