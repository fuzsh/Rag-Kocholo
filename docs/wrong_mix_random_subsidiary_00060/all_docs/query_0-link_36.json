Bertozzi\n\nBorn: October 10, 1966 | age 56 years | Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nNationality: American\n\nPublications: Glycochemistry: Principles: Synthesis, and Applications: Principles, Synthesis and Applications, Chemical Glycobiology and more.\n\nCarolyn Ruth Bertozzi is an American chemist and Nobel laureate known for her wide-ranging work in chemistry and biology. She coined the term “bioorthogonal chemistry” for chemical reactions compatible with living systems.\n\nMorten Meldal\n\nBorn: January 16, 1954 | age 68 years | Denmark\n\nNationality: Danish\n\nPublications: Reactions of Unsaturated Sugars with Hydrogen Halides, and more.\n\nMorten Peter Meldal is a Danish chemist and Nobel laureate. He is a professor of Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark. He is best known for developing the CuAAC-click reaction concurrently but independently of Valery V. Fokin and K. Barry Sharpless.\n\nK. Barry Sharpless\n\nBorn: April 28, 1941 | age 81 years | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.\n\nNationality: American\n\nPublications: Bioorthogonal chemistry, Enantioselective synthesis and more.\n\nKarl Barry Sharpless is an American Chemist and a two-time Nobel laureate in Chemistry known for his work on stereoselective reactions and Click Chemistry. The term “click chemistry” was coined by Sharpless in 1998, and was first fully described by Sharpless, Hartmuth Kolb, and M.G. Finn at The Scripps Research Institute in 2001. As of 2022, Sharpless has an h-index of 180 according to Google Scholar and of 124 according to Scopus.\n\nNobel Prize for Physics:\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that the Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 is awarded to Alain Aspect (France), John F. Clauser (USA), and Anton Zeilinger (Austria) for their work on quantum mechanics. The prize in Physics has been awarded for experiments involving entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science.\n\nAlain Aspect\n\nBorn: June 15, 1947 | age 75 years | Agen, France\n\nNationality: French\n\nPublications: Introduction to Quantum Optics, Single-Photon Generation and Detection, and more.\n\nAlain Aspect is a French physicist noted for his experimental work on quantum entanglement. Mr. Aspect’s experiments, following the first experiment of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972, were considered to support the thesis that Bell’s inequalities are violated in its CHSH version, particularly by closing a form of the locality loophole. However, his results were not wholly conclusive since there were loopholes that allowed for alternative explanations that comply with local realism.\n\nJohn Clauser\n\nBorn: December 1, 1942, | age 79 years | Pasadena, California, U.S.\n\nNationality: American\n\nPublications: Test Excavations at Raleigh’s Union Square, The Seaboard Excavations, and more.\n\nJohn Francis Clauser is an American theoretical and experimental physicist known for contributing to the foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality. In 2010, Clauser was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics, along with Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger.\n\nAnton Zeilinger\n\nBorn: May 20, 1945 (age 77 years), Ried im Innkreis, Austria\n\nNationality: Austrian\n\nPublications: Dance of the Photons, Quantum Information, and more.\n\nAnton Zeilinger is an Austrian quantum physicist and Nobel laureate in physics of 2022. Zeilinger is a professor of physics emeritus at the University of Vienna and a Senior Scientist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\nNobel Prize for Literature:\n\nThe Swedish Academy has announced the Nobel Prize in Literature 2022 to Annie Ernaux (France). She has been awarded for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements, and collective restraints of personal memory. Accordingly, the Swedish Academy awarded the nobel prize in literature.\n\nAnnie Ernaux\n\nBorn: September 1, 1940 (age 82 years), Lillebonne, France\n\nNationality: French\n\nPublications: Happening, The Years (Les Années), and more.\n\nAnnie Thérèse Blanche Ernaux is a French writer, Professor of Literature, and Nobel laureate. Her literary work, primarily autobiographical, maintains close links with sociology. She studied at the universities of Rouen and then Bordeaux, qualified as a schoolteacher, and earned a higher degree in modern literature in 1971.\n\nShe worked for a time on an unfinished thesis project on Pierre de Marivaux. In the early 1970s, Mr. Ernaux taught at a lycée in Bonneville, Haute-Savoie, at the college of Évire in Annecy-le-Vieux, then in Pontoise, before joining the National Centre for Distance Education, where she was employed for 23 years."
