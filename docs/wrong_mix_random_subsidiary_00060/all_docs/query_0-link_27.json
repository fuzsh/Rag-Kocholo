Nehru having set the tone for political leadership on the map of the world in a dominant position, then Prime Ministers Shastri, Smt Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi have led India to occupy an impressive place in military, economic, and nuclear position in the world. We are the envy of not only the developing but the developed countries too. Our Scientists, sportspersons and artists have done the country proud. Though politicatly we may be with our forefathers, economically we have developed but with glaring inequalities in education, income and wealth distribution. The country has however seen remarkable technological growth- but at what cost? Let's discover this India, Our India as we pay Samarpan to the legends that have created this country. Let the contribution of legends inspire the youth to say' JAI HO!' Dr. Patricia Gabriel\n\nAMARTYA SEN Amartya Kumar Sen was born on 3rd November 1933 in Santiniketan West Bengal.

RAHMAN Born in Chennai on January 6, 1967 as A. S. Dileep Kumar, he came to known as A.R. (Allah Rakha Rahman) after he converted to Islam. His father, who worked as a composer and conductor died when A. R.Rahman was young as a result of which he had a difficult childhood. When he was just 11, he joined the troupe of famous South Indian composer Ilaiyaraaja. He later graduated from the Trinity College at Oxford University, with a degree in Western classical music. His lucky break came when he was asked by Mani Ratnam to compose the music for his ~\\\" . movie Roja in 1991. Roja's music went on to create waves and there was no looking back ever since. His music was very different from the rest of the pack. He made his debut in Bollywood with the film Rangeela, directed by Ram Gopal Varma. He has worked with all the leading directors both in Bollywood as well as in the South Indian film industry. He has won international acclaim. He composed the score and soundtrack for the Chinese film Warriors of Heaven and Earth in 2003. The famous international composer Andrew Lloyd Webber hired Rahman to compose the music for his maiden stage production Bombay Dreams in 2002. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest film composers ever, and his career is considered a turning point in the history of film music. Many credit him with having single-handedly revolutionized the standards of film music composition in India. He is also credited with re-energizing the popularity of Indian film music the world over.\n\nIn a career spanning over a decade, Rahman, by 2003, had sold more than one hundred million records of his film scores and soundtracks world-wide, and sold over 200 million cassettes making him one of the world's top 30 all-time top selling recording artists. The debut led Rahman to receive the Rajat Kamal award for Best Music Director at the National Film Awards, the first time ever by a first-time film composer. Rahman has since then gone on to win the award three more times (for his scores for Minsaara Kanavu in 1997, Lagaan in 2002, Kannathil Muthamittal in 2003, the most ever by any composer. His first movie album Roja was listed in TIME's \\\"Top 10 Movie Soundtracks of All Time\\\" in 2005. A.M. Studios is considered to be the most developed, equipped and high tech studio of Asia. In 2006, Rahman launched his own music label, KM Musiq. Rahman has been involved in several projects apart from films. He made an album Vande Mataram (1997) on India's 50th anniversary of independence which had immense success. He followed it up with an album called Jana gana mana, a conglomeration of performances by many leading exponents/ artists of Indian classical music. In addition to writing jingles for ads, he has composed several orchestrations for athletic events and T.V. and internet media publications, documentaries and short films. In 1999, Rahman, along with choreographers Shobhana and Prabhu Deva Sundaram and a dancing troupe from the Tamil film industry performed with Michael Jackson in Munich, Germany, for his \\\"Michael Jackson and Friends Concert.\\\" Furthermore, Rahman, along with the Finnish folk music band Vartttna, composed the music for The Lord of the Rings theatre production. He composed the piece \\\"Raga's Dance\\\" for Vanessa-Mae's album Choreography (2004). In the last six years, he has performed in three successful world tours of his concerts to audiences in Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Dubai, UK, Canada, the US (Hollywood Bowl and 3d tour) and India. Rahman's instant success is owed to his clever usage of Western instruments to invoke Indian sounds while his peers tried to invoke Western sounds through Indian instruments. A.R.Rahman came under harsh criticism by several Carnatic music veterans for drowning the lyrics with gadgetry. the Padma Shri award from the Government of India is granted to him as recognation to his achivement. The latest feather in his cap has been the oscars won by him for his music score in the film slumdog millianaire.\n\nARUNDHATI ROY Arundhati Roy (born November 24, 1961) is an Indian novelist, activist and a world citizen. She won the Booker Prize in 1997 for her first novel \\\"The God of Small Things.\\\" Roy was born in Shillong, Meghalaya to a Keralite Syrian Christian mother and a Bengali Hindu father, a tea planter by profession. She spent her childhood in Aymanam, in Kerala and did her schooling in Corpus Christi. She left Kerala for Delhi at the age of 16, and embarked on a homeless lifestyle, staying in a small hut with a tin roof within the walls of Delhi's Feroz Shah KotLa and making a living selling empty bottles. She then proceeded to study architecture at the Delhi School of Architecture, where she met her first husband, the architect Gerard Da Cunha. The God of Small Things is the only novel written by Roy. Since winning the Booker Prize, she has concentrated her writing on political issues. These include the Narmada Dam project, India's Nuclear Weapons, corrupt power company Enron's activities in India. She is a figure- head of the anti-globalization/alter-globalization movement and a vehement critic of neo-imperialism. In response to India's testing of nuclear weapons in Pokhran, Rajasthan, Roy wrote \\\"The End of Imagination\\\", a critique of the Indian government's nuclear policies. It was published in her collection \\\"The Cost of Living\\\", in which she also crusaded against India's massive hydroelectric dam projects in the central and western states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. She has since devoted herself solely to nonfiction and politics, publishing two more collections of essays as well as working for social causes. Roy was awarded the Syd ney Peace Prize in May 2004 for her work in social campaigns and advocacy of non-violence. In June 2005 she took pa rt in the World Tribunal on Iraq. In January 2006 she was awarded th e Sahitya Akademi award for her collection of essays, 'The Algebra of Infinite Justice', but declined to accept it.\n\nASHA BHONSLE The living legend Asha Bhonsle, one of the Mangeshkar sisters was born on 8th September, 1933 in a small hamlet called 'Goar' in Maharastra. Born to the renowed Maharashtrian, actor and singer Dinanath Mangeshkar, Asha like her other sisters and brother was introduced to music at a very tender age. Asha gave her first playback for the movie 'Badi Maa' released in the year 1944/1945, though officially her first song was for the movie Chunaria (1948). Her first solo song was for the film Raat Ki Raani (1949). Reputed to have sung over 20,000 songs in more than 14 languages, Bhonsle's lively style knows no limits - it matched the fun dances to the numbers picturized on Helen in the film Chinatown, and Aiye meherbaan picturized on Madhubala in the film Howrah Bridge At 60-plus she still dares to challenge the youngsters on the scene, Alka Yagnik, Kavita Krishnamurty, Sadhana Sargam in evocative songs 'Yai Re, Yai Re...' & 'Tanha Tanha ...' both from Rangeela or 'Rang De...' from Takshak. She teams with Adnam Sami & 'Ghulam Ali' with the equal ease for private albums of Songs or ghazal. Having started her career in her elder sister's shadow, she has outgrown every contemporary singer. Despite having sung varied styles and types of music, her forte is the bubbly and naughty songs. With the main songs of film going to Lata, Asha successfully managed to stamp her songs with her inimitable style. O.P.Nayyar & R.D.Burman exploited her singing talent & experimented with her vocal cords to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine their music without her or Asha without them. Teesri Manzil, Ijazat,\n\nKhushboo with R.D.Burman, Mere Sanam, Kashmir Ki Kali, Ek Musafir Ek Haseena, 'Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye' & many others with O.P.Nayyar have added unforgettable rare gems to film music. Her exuberance & ease in qawali like 'Nighan Mila Ne Ko Jee Chahta Hai...', 'Raaj Ki Baat Kahdu To...' & 'Hum Kisise Kum Nahin ...'; bhajan, 'Sun Le Pukar ...'; gazal, 'Is Akhon Ki Masti Ke...'; Cabaret, 'Piya Tu Ab Aaja ...', 'Duniya Mein ...', • Reshmi Ujala Hai...', stuns you out of your wits. Moreover she sings in more than twenty languages including English. History of Indian film music would never be complete without Lata, Rafi, Kishore & off course 'Asha Bhonsle'. BABAAMTE Muralidhar Devdas Amte, popularly known as Baba Amte, was born on 26 December, 1914 in Hinganghat, Wardha district in Maharashtra. He was the eldest son of his parents. His father was a wealthy Brahmin landowner of Wardha district, who owned over 450 acres of good cultivable land. The name 'Baba' was affectionately given by his parents. At a very young age, Baba Amte owned a gun and used to hunt wild boar and deer. Later, he went on to own an expensive sports car, cushioned with panther skin. From a child born with a sliver spoon in his mouth, Baba Amte later transformed his life into a social activist. He devoted his entire life to serve the downtrodden people of the society. He studied Law and started a lucrative practice in Wardha, but was moved by the distressed condition of the poor and downtrodden classes of society. Then he reli nquished his ceremonial dress and started working with the rag-pickers and sweepers for sometime in Chandrapura district. Later, he resumed practicing but as a \\\"defence lawyer\\\" for the leaders imprisoned in the 1942 Quit India movement. Amte, like Vinoba Bhave was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. Amte was a constant follower of Gandhiji and practiced various aspects of Gandhism for his entire life. In 1946, Baba Amte married Sadhana Guleshastri. She was also a\n\nbeliever of humanity and always supported Baba Amte in his social works. She was popularly known as Sadhnatai. 'Tai' in Marathi language means \\\"elder sister\\\". After pursuing a leprosy orientation course at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, Baba Amte set up 11 weekly clinics and started working for those struck by leprosy. Later in 1951, Ba'03 Amte was given 250 acres of land by the state government on which Amte founded the Anandvan ashram. Inside the ashram premises, two hospitals, a university, an orphanage and a school for the blind were opened. In 1990, Baba Amte left Anandvan to join Medha Patkar's Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save Narmada Movement). While leaving Anandvan Baba said, \\\"I am leaving to live along the Narmada ... Narmada will linger on the lips of the nation as a symbol of all struggles against social injustice.\\\" !n place of the dams, the Narmada Bachao Andolan demanded for an energy and water strategy based on improving dry farming technology, watershed development, small dams, lift schemes for irrigation and drinking water, and improved efficiency and utilization of existing dams. Baba wanted the youth to enlighten themselves with knowledge so that they can understand the meaning and importance of India's freedom. Baba had once said, \\\"We must try to understand this power contained in the roots of trees. Only when you will understand this phenomenon, will you find the courage to embrace adventure and perform what needs to be done. Those who want to bring about creative revolution must fully understand this root phenomenon.\\\" The work of Baba Amte, was unanimously praised by many national and international organizations. He was awarded with the United Nations Human Rights Prize, the Ramon Magsaysay award (1985), the Templeton Prize(1990), the Gandhi Peace Prize, and many other humanitarian and environmental prizes. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is often considered as the \\\"Nobel Prize of Asia\\\". In 2007, Baba Amte was diagnosed with leukemia. After suffering for more than a year, Amte left his mortal body on 9 February, 2008 at Anandvan. Many renowned faces from across the world expressed condolences at the death of the great soul. Unlike Hindu rituals, the body of Baba Amte was buried not cremated\n\nBIRJU MAHARAJ One of the leading exponents of Kathak, Pandit Birju Maharaj is a renowned classical dancer of India.

Aswathi 06/HS/38\n\n81SMILLAH KHAN The legendary shehnai maestro, a man of tenderness, a man who believed in remaining private and who believed that musicians are supposed to be heard and not seen. The legend was born on 21 March 1916. His ancestors were court musicians in the princely state of Dumraon in Bihar and he was trained under his uncle, the late Ali Bux 'Vilayatu', a shehnai player attached to Varanasi's Vishwanath Temple. It was Khan Sahib who poured his heart out into Raga Kafi from Red Fort on the eve of India's first Republic Day ceremony. Where others see conflict and contradiction between his music and his religion, Bismillah Khan sees only a divine unity. Music, sur, namaaz is the same thing. His namaaz is the seven shuddh and five komal surs. Even as a devout Shia, Khan Sahib is also a staunch devotee of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of music. His honorary doctorate from the Benares Hindu University and Shantiniketan bespeaks of his fame. He has been bequeathed with the Sangeet Natak Academi Award, the Tansen Award of the Madhya Pradesh government and also the prestigious Padma Vibhushan. He has played in Afghanistan, Europe, Iran, Iraq, Canada, West Africa, USA, USSR,Japan, Hong Kong and almost every capital city across the world. His music is an ocean and he feels that he has barely reached the shore after 81 years of his life and his search is still incomplete.\n\nDADA SAHIB PHALKB, THE LEGEND Of INDIAN CINEMA (1870 -1944) The boy born in 1870 to Oaji Sahib, a professor of Sanskrit, grew up as Dhundiraj Govind Phalke and later became a legend in the history of Indian Films as Dada Sahib Phalke. He made Raja Harishchandra, India's first indigenous siLent movie and became the foster father of Indian moviedom by his contributions that continued for several years. For Raja Harishchandra, he played the lead role, wrote the script, coached up other actors, designed the costumes, operated the camera, took out the print, edited it ..... .from paper work to the final projection, all by himself. It marked the birth of one of the first feature films produced in India, and the birth of the film industry in the country. Phalke evinced a keen in terest in liberal arts from his younger days and joined a famous school of arts in Bombay in 1885, and then shifted to Baroda, the seat of arts in western India. He studied architecture and photography and grabbed a job as a still photographer and draftsman in the archeology department (1903). This life attracted him to the world of films. He went to Germany to get trained in colour processing (1909). He managed to set up a printing press in Bombay and brought out two pictorial magazines. His fascination for films was so intense that he made a short film called 'The Growth of a Pea Plant.' He went to England, managed to gather information about making films, and collected raw film stocks, and equipments for film making, before returning to Bombay. It was with these new found equipments and ideas, that he made Raja Harishchandra, almost single-handed. On April 21, 1913 his film was exhibited before an invited audience at the Coronation Theatre in Bombay, and that was the beginning of commercial film industry in India. Phalke set up a film studio, which included a chemical lab as also a distribution company. In 1913 he made another film, Bhasmasur Mohini, in which for the first time in India two women too acted. It was in 1932 that films in India became talkies. In the same year Phalke made his last silent movie, Sethubandhan. He had made more than hundred feature films and around twenty short films. In 1937 he made his last film Gangavatharan.\n\nThough he made films and made history, his last days were miserable. When the silver jubilee of film making in India was celebrated in 1942, he too was invited, but his pioneering role in Indian filmmaking was not properly recognized. However, the film fraternity in Bombay collected a fund and purchased a house for him and it was in this house that he spent his final days before passing into history. Nation honoured his memory in many ways and one of those is the setting up of Dada Sahib Phalke Award, the highest award for a filmmaker in India. DHANRAJ PILLAI Dhanraj Pillai was born as the fourth son of Nagalingam Pillai and Andammaat Khadkiin Maharashtra. A hockeyenthusiast from childhood, Dhanraj moved to Mumbai as a young man, to join his elder brother, Ramesh.Rameshwas playing hockey, then, in the Mumbai Leagueand had previouslyplayed for India in International matches.

He went on to play 339 international matches in a long and fruitful career that spanned fifteen years from December 1989 to August 2004. Unfortunately there are no official statistics as to the number of international goals he scored during this period. The estimates of statisticians place this anywhere between 120 and 170 - a great number and evidently the mark of a master hockey player. Dhanraj Pillai is the only Indian to have played in four Olympics - 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004. He has also played in four World Cups (1990, 1994, 1998 and 2008), four champions' trophies (1995, 1996, 2002 and 2003) and four Asian games (1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002). India won the Asian Games in 1998 and the Asia Cup in 2003 under his captaincy. He was also the highest goal scorer in the Bangkok Asian games and was the only Indian player to figure in the World Eleven sides during the World Cup at Sydney. Dhanraj Pillai is the recipient of India's highest sporting honour - the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2000. He was also awarded the\n\nPadma Sri title in 2000. He is one of the most gifted forwards of his era. With a small and lithe frame and flowing locks he could wreak havoc in rival defenses and was a veritable annihilator. He was awarded the Player of the Tournament award in the 2002 Champions' Trophy games held in Germany. Pillai is currently involved in an effort to start a hockey team in Bombay. To raise funds for his academy, he is heading a drive to collect empty printer cartridges in Bombay. DK PATTAMMAL Dam al Krishnaswami Pattammal took Carnatic musi c to new heights by blending traditionalism and trailblazing novelism, and defied tradition to become the first Brahmin woman to give public concerts. She challenged traditional attitudes, not by argument, but by talent. Thus, DKP, as she is popularly known, was the first woman to sing in concerts ragam-talam-pallavis, the rhythmic complexities of which call for great skill and demand a high degree of concentration. And all this with no formal grounding in basics. Circumstances prevented her from learning in the gurukula system under one guru. But she trained under many vidwans to acquire a rich and varied repertoire of not merely the compositions of the Trinity - Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri - but also the Tamil kritis of Muttuthandavar, Arunachala Kavi, Gopalakrishna Bharati, Subhramania Bharati, and hymns from such Tamil devotional anthologies as Tiruppugazh, Thevaram and Arutpa. Again, in a break with tradition, DKP was among the first woman playback singers in films where she is best remembered for her rendering of patriotic songs in Naam Iruvar and Thookku Thookki. Her special talent and musical sensibility were evident even when she was three. DKP managed to break social shackles, nurture her talent and rise to become a major figure in the world of Carnatic music. And since 1933, when as a 14-year old she began her career in music, she has not looked back.\n\nDKP's 65-year-old career has seen her winning innumerable awards and titles, including the coveted Sangita Kalanidhi conferred by the Madras Music Academy (1970), the Padma Bhushan (1971), the Kalidas Samman (1998-99) and the Padma Vibushan (1999) conferred by the President of India. For Pattammal, however, the most significant accolade is the one from one of the giants of Carnatic music, \\\"Tiger\\\" Varadachari, who described her as Gana Saraswati. S. Panimalar 06/HS/44 Dr. RAJENDRA PRASAD Dr. Rajendra Prasad was born on December 3, 1884 in Ziradei Village in Siwan District of Bihar near Chapra. His father, Mahadev Sahai was a Persian and Sanskrit language scholar. His mother, Kamleshwari Devi was a devout lady who would tell stories from the Ramayana to her son. At the age of five, the young Rajendra Prasad was sent to a Maulavi for learning Persian. Later, he was taught Hindi and Arithmetic. After that he was sent to Chapra Zilla School for further primary studies. At the age of 12 Rajendra Prasad was married to Rajvanshi Devi. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was a brilliant student. He stood first in the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta at the age of 18. He joined the Presidency College in 1902. He passed with a Gold Medal in Master's in Law examination. He went on to complete his Doctorate in Law. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the first President of Independent India. He also was the President of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the Constitution. He had also served as a Cabinet Minister briefly in the first Government of Independent India. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was one of the foremost disciples of Gandhiji and he played a crucial role in the Indian Freedom Struggle. The arrival of Mahatma Gandhi on the Indian National Scene greatly influenced Dr. Rajendra Prasad. While Gandhiji was on a fact-finding mission in the Champairan District of Bihar, he called on Rajendra Prasad to come to Champairan with volunteers. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was greatly impressed by the dedication, conviction and courage that\n\nGandhiji displayed. Gandhiji's influence greatly altered Dr. Rajendra Prasad's outlook. He sought ways to simplify his life and reduced the number of servants he had once. He started doing his life chores such as sweeping the floor, washing the utensils - the tasks he had all along assumed others would do for him. After coming into contact with Gandhiji, Dr. Rajendra Prasadimmersed himself fully into the freedom struggle. He played an active role during the Non-Cooperation movement. Dr. Rajendra Prasadwas arrested in 1930 while participating in the Salt Satyagraha. He was in jail when on 15th January 1934a devastating earthquake struck Bihar. Dr. Rajendra Prasadwas released from the jail two days later and he immediately set himself for the task of raising funds and organizing relief. The viceroy also raised a fund for the purpose. However while Rajendra Prasad's fund collected over Rs.3.8 million, the viceroy could only manage one third of that amount. The way the relief was organized, it amply demonstrated the administrative acumen of Dr. Rajendra Prasad.Soonafter this Dr. Rajendra Prasadwas elected as the President of the Bombaysessionof the Indian National Congress.He was elected as the Congress President again in 1939 following the resignation of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose. In July 1946, when the Constituent Assemblywas established to frame the Constitution of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasadwas elected as President. Two and a half years after independence, on January 26, 1950 the Constitution of Independent India was ratified and Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as India's first President. As a President, he used his moderating influence silently and unobtrusively and set a healthy precedent for others to follow. During his tenure as president he visited many countries on missionsof goodwill and sought to establish and nourish new relationships. In 1962, after 12 years as president, Dr. Rajendra Prasad retired and was subsequentlyawarded the Bharat Ratna, the nations highest civilian award. He spent the last few months of his life in retirement at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Dr. Rajendra Prasad died on February 28, 1963. S. Soosaiammal 06/HS/11\n\nFATHIMA BIBI Justice M.

She was then elevated to the High Court as a Judge on 4th August 1983.She became permanent Judge of the High Court on 14th May 1984. She retired as the Judge of the High Court on 29th April 1989 but was further elevated to the Supreme Court as a Judge on 6th October 1989 where she retired on 29th April 1992. She later went on to become Governor of Tamil Nadu on 25th January 1997.Appointing her as the Governor of TN and Justice S S Kang, formerly chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir high court, as Governor of Kerala, then President of India, Shankar Dayal Sharma said \\\"Their experience of and insights into the working of the Constitution and the laws comprise valuable assets.\\\" As the Governor of the state, She rejected the mercy petitions filed by the four condemned prisoners in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The prisoners had sent the mercy petitions to the Governor, pleading her to exercise her power under Article 161 of the Constitution (the Governor's power to grant pardon).As the Governor of the state she had also served as the Chancellor of Madras University. It was reported by university sources that the Vice-Chancellor,P.T. Manoharan, had decided to quit his office in the wake of the Chancellor allegedly withholding her approval to the Syndicate's decision to establish a new\n\ndepartment for contemporary Tamil literature. She had also served as the Chairman of Kerala Commission for Backward Classes(1993) and member of National Human Rights Commission ( 1993). She received Hon. D Litt and Mahila Shiromani Award in 1990. She was also awarded Bharat Jyoti Award. The left parties also discussed the nomination of the prospects of Fathima Bibi as the President of India . during which the NDA Government proposed the name of Dr.A P J Abdul Kalam. She currently resides at her ancestral house in Pathanamthitta, Kerala. MANMOHAN SINGH Manmohan Singh is the 17th and current Prime Minister of the Republic of India. He also serves as the Union Minister for Finance, succeeding P. Chidambaram. He was the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982 to 1985 and held the post of the Finance Minister of India from 1991 to 1996 under Narsimha Rao-led government. Singh belongs to the Indian National Congress party and took oath as the Prime Minister of India on May 22, 2004, becoming the first person of Sikh faith to hold the post. An economist by profession, Singh has previously worked at organizations like the international Monetary Fund and the United Nations. During his tenure as the Finance Minister, he was widely credited for initiating economic reforms in India in 1991 that resulted in the end of the infamous License Raj system Manmohan Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab (now in Chakwal District. Pakistan). After the Partition of India, he migrated to Amritsar. He then went to Punjab University to study Economics and attained his bachelor's and master's degree in 1952 and 1954 respectively, standing first throughout his academic career. He went on to get a Master's degree from St. John's College, Cambridge\n\nUniversity, where he won the Wright's Prize for distinguished performance in 1955 and 1957.ln 1962, Singh completed his D.Phil from the University of Oxford Nuffield College. The topic of his doctorate thesis was \\\"India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self- Sustained Growth\\\". In 1997, the University of Alberta presented him with an Honorary Doctor of Law. The University of Oxford awarded him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree in June 2005. St John's College and the University of Cambridge honored him by naming a PhD Scholarship after him, the Dr Manmohan Singh Scholarship. In 1991, India's then-Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be the Finance Minster of India. At the time, India was facing an economic crisis. Raoand Singh decided to open-up the Indian economy and change the socialist economic system to a capitalist economy. These economic reforms are credited with bringing high levels of economic growth in India, and changing the annual economic growth in the following years. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas. Singh was first elected to the upper house of the Indian Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1995 and was re-elected in 2001 and 2007.After the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congressstunned the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA)by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. In a surprise move, United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a technocrat, as the UPAcandidate for the Prime Minister post. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a Lok Sabha seat, his considerable goodwill and Sonia Gandhi's nomination won him the support of the UPA allies and the Left Front.During his tenure, Singh's administration hasfocused on reducing the fiscal deficit, providing debt-relief to poor farmers, extending social programs and advancing the pro-industry economic and tax policies that have launched the country on a major economic expansion course since 2002.\n\nFIELD MARSHAL S.H.F.J. MANEKSHAW - FADMA VIBHUSHAN, FADMA BHUSHAN, MC -COAS, 07 JUNE 1969 - 15 JAN 1973 -INfANTRY, 8 GORKHA RIfLES Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw assumed charge of the Indian Army, as the 8th Chief of Army Staff, on 07 June 1969. Born in Amritsar, Punjab on 03 April 1914, he completed his schooling in Amritsar and Sherwood College, Nainital. He then joined the first batch of 40 cadets at Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehra Dun on 01 October 1932. He passed out of the IMA in December 1934 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Indian Army. He held several regimental assignments and was first attached to the Royal Scouts and later to the 12 Frontier Force Rifles. During World War II, he saw action in the Burma campaign on Sittang river and has the rare distinction of being honoured for his bravery on the battle front itself. Manekshaw showed acumen for planning and administration while handling the issues related to partition in 1947, and later put to use his battle skills during the 1947-48 Jammu &. Kashmir Operations. He commanded a Division in Jammu &. Kashmir and a Corps in the North East, with tenure as Commandant of Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) in between. As GOC-in-C Eastern Command, he handled the tricky problem of insurgency in Nagaland and the grateful nation honoured him with a Padma Bhushan - India's third highest civilian honour - in 1968. Manekshaw succeeded General Kumaramangalam as Chief of Army Staff (COAS) on 07 June 1969. His years of military experience were soon put to the test in the war in December 1971. During the military campaign, Manekshaw showed uncommon ability to motivate the forces, coupling it with a mature war strategy. The war ended with Pakistan's unconditional surrender. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1972 and was conferred with the honorary rank of Field Marshal on 01 January 1973. He retired a fortnight later, on 15 January 1973, after completing nearly four decades of military service. Antoinette Martina 06/HS/12\n\nN. R. NARAYANA MURTHY Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy, better known as N. R. Narayana Murthy, is an Indian industrialist, software engineer and one of the seven founders of Infosys Technologies, a global consulting and IT services company based in India. He is currently the non-executive Chairman and Chief Mentor of Infosys. He was the CEOof the company for 21 years, from 1981 to 2002. After stepping down as CEOin 2002, he has broadened his scope of activities to social services as well as promoting India globally. Murthy's corporate and social vision has been appreciated globally and he is the recipient of several awards including Padma Vibushan - India's second highest civilian award. Born into a KannadaMadhva Brahmin family in Mysore, India on August 20, 1946, Murthy graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from the National Institute of Engineering, University of Mysore in 1967 after attending government school, and received his master's degree from liT Kanpur in 1969. His first position was at 11MAhmedabad as chief systems programmer where he worked on a time-sharing system and designed and implemented a BASICinterpreter for ECiL (Electronics Corporation of India Limited). After 11MAhmedabad, he then joined Patni Computer Systemsin Pune. Before moving to Mumbai, Murthy met his wife SudhaMurthy in Pune who at the time was an engineer working at Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. (Telco, now known as Tata Motors) in Pune. In 1981, he founded Infosys with six other software professionals. He served as president of the National Association of Software and Service Companies, India from 1992 to 1994. Mr. Murthy is the brother-in-law of serial entrepreneur Gururaj \\\"Desh\\\" Deshpande and the uncle of former NASSCOMChairman and MphasiS chief Jerry Rao Murthy served as the founder CEO of Infosys for 21 years, and was succeeded by co-founder Nandan Nilekani in March 2002. He is the chairman of the governing body of the International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore, and was the Chairman of the Governing Body of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. In addition, he is a member of the Board of Directors of INSEAD,\n\nBoard of Overseers of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Cornell University Board of Trustees, Business Advisory Council of Great Lakes Institute of Management - Chennai, Singapore Management University Board of Trustees and the Board of Advisors for the William F.Achtmeyer Center for Global Leadership at the Tuck School of Business.

He is the chairman of the, Asia Business Council, an organization headquartered in Hong Kong. He is also a member of the Advisory Boards and Councils of various well-known universities - such as the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the Corporate Governance initiative at the Harvard Business School, Yale University and the University of Tokyo's President's Council. Murthy serves as an independent director on the board of the DBS Bank of Singapore. This is the largest government-owned bank in Singapore. He also serves as a director on the Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India, as the co-chairman of the Indo-British Partnership, as a member of the Prime Minister's council on trade and industry, as a member of the Asia Advisory Board of British Telecommunications pIc. and as a member of the Board of NDTV, India. He also serves as an independent director on the board of the European FMCG giantUnilever. He is an IT advisor to several Asian countries. He is also an Independent Director on the board of HSBC. He retired from his executive position at Infosys on 20th August, 2006. However, he continues as the Non-Executive Chairman of the board. Murthy has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors. In 2008, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, and Legion d'honneur highest civilian award by France. In 2000, he was awarded the Padma Shri, a civilian award by the Government of India. He was the first recipient of the Indo-French Forum Medal (in the year 2003), awarded by the Indo-French Forum, in recognition of his role in promoting Indo-French ties. He was voted the World Entrepreneur of the Year - 2003 by Ernst ft Young. He was one of the two people named as Asia's Businessmen of the Year for 2003 by Fortune magazine. In 2001, he was named by TIME / CNN as one of the twenty-five, most influential\n\nglobal executives, a group selected for their lasting influence in creating new industries and reshaping markets. He was awarded the Max Schmidheiny Liberty 2001 prize ( Switzerland), in recognition of his promotion of individual responsibility and liberty. In 1999, BusinessWeek named him one of the nine entrepreneurs of the year and he was also featured in the BusinessWeek's 'The Stars of Asia' (for three successive years - 1998, 1999 and 2000). In 1998, the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, one of the premier institutes of higher learning in India, conferred on him the Distinguished Alumnus Award, and in 1996- 97, he was awarded the JRD Tata Corporate Leadership Award. In December 2005, Narayana Murthy was voted as the 7th most admired CEO/Chairman in the world in a global study conducted by Burson- Marsteller with the Economist Intelligence Unit [4]. The list included 14 others with distinguished names such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett. In May 2006, Narayana Murthy has, for the fifth year running, emerged the most admired business leader of India in a study conducted by Brand-comm, a leading Brand Consulting, Advertising and PR firm. The Economist ranked him 8th among the top 15 most admired global leaders (2005). He was ranked 28th among the world's most-respected business leaders by the Financial Times (2005). He topped the Economic Times Corporate Dossier list of India's most powerful CEOs for two consecutive years - 2004 and 2005. TIME magazine's \\\"Global Tech Influentials\\\" list (August 2004) named Mr. Murthy as one of the ten leaders who are helping shape the future of technology. In November 2006, TIME magazine again voted him as one of the Asian heroes who have brought about revolutionary changes in Asia in the last 60 years. The list featured people who have had a significant impact on Asian history over the past 60 years and it included others such as Mahatma Gandhi, Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa,Muhammad Ali Jinnah etc. Narayana Murthy's trait of plain-speak and honesty has landed him in many altercations with local political leaders. While the political leaders insist that Narayana Murthy was eyeing India's presidential nomination, Narayana Murthy has repeated many times that he has no interest in politics. The former President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Infosys\n\ncampus on April 8, 2007 and during the event, the instrumental version of the Indian national anthem was played instead of a recital. When a newsreporter asked for explanation, Narayana Murthy replied that he didn't want to embarrass his foreign guests leading to protests from a wide section of politicians and social activitists. Narayana Murthy quickly apologized for the incident but political parties insisted on action against him. While the lower courts issued summons to Murthy for explanation, the High Court of Karnataka quashed all proceedings on the case because of lack of any substance in the charges against Murthy. The controversy however deflected attention from the fact that Abdul Kalam thought highly of NarayanaMurthy for the post of President of India. NarayanaMurthy was critical of the bandh call by politicians protesting against the decision of the Kaveri river water dispute leading to protests from political activists against Murthy. Earlier in 2005, Deve Gowda, former Indian PM, accused Murthy of \\\"double-talk\\\" when Murthy expressed his concerns on the state of Bangalore infrastructure. In response, Murthy resigned from the post of Chairman for the then upcoming greenfield International airport project (BIAL)taking offense to the assertion that he didn't spend adequate time in the project. Murthy also replied to every point raised by Gowda on land acquisition by Infosys leading the ex-PM to go silent. As Chairman of The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Narayana Murthy spoke his mind on the Human ResourceDevelopment Ministry's action to reduce admission fee as well as the move to decline permission to the institute for setting up of a global campus. In both cases, the HRDministers had to concede to Murthy. His most Quoted. \\\"The real power of money is the power to give it away.\\\" \\\"In God we trust, everybody else bring data to the table.\\\"\n\nINDIRA GANDHI Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister of the Republic of India for three consecutive terms - from 1966 to 1977 and for a fourth term from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was India's first, and to date, only female Prime Minister. Born in the politically influential Nehru family, Indira grew up in an intensely political atmosphere. Her grandfather, Motilal Nehru, was a prominent Indian nationalist leader. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru was a pivotal figure in the Indian independence movement and the first Prime Minister of Independent India. Returning to India from Oxford in 1941, Indira Gandhi herself took part in the independence movement. In the 1950s, she served her father unofficially as a personal assistant during his tenure as India's first Prime Minister. After her father's death in 1964, she was appointed a member of a Rajya Sabha by the President of India and became a member of Lal Bahadur Shastri's cabinet as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. The Congress Party President, K. Kamaraj was instrumental in making Indira Gandhi the Prime Minister after the sudden demise of Shastri in Tashkent in 1966. Gandhi soon showed an ability to win the hearts and minds of the Indian people. Though often criticized for her ultra- left wing economic policies such as the MRTP (Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices) Act and the Nationalization of Banks in 1969, Indira Gandhi showed a great capacity to govern the country and manage the fault lines in Parliament. Her achievements as Prime Minister lie in her encouragement of the Green Revolution and in that it was under her that India became a nuclear power. The decisive victory against Pakistan in the war of 1971 has also been greatly applauded. Following a period of instability in the early 1970s, emergency was imposed. This had mixed results. On the one hand, basic rights such as the freedom of speech and expression, were largely suppressed as newspaper, radio and the yet inchoate Television were censored strtctly to ensure there was no criticism of Indira Gandhi's government. On the other hand, however, corruption was reduced greatly and formerly non-functional government offices began to function efficiently as stringent measures were taken for inefficiency.\n\nIndira Gandhi returned to office in the newly restored democracy in 1980. She however became involved in a bitter conflict with the separatists in Punjab and following the incendiary raid into the Golden Temple in Operation Blue Star to rid the Punjab of secessionist elements and secret militant organizations, she was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984. JCBOSE Physicist turned plant biologist Jagadish Chandra Bose was born on 30 November 1858 in Mymensingh, India (now in Bangladesh) to a well-to-do family. His father Bhagabanchandra Bose was a Deputy Magistrate. A distinguished student, he began attending St. Xavier's College, Calcutta in 1875 and received the BA degree from Calcutta University in 1877. In 1880 the twenty-two-year old Bose left India for England. For a year he studied medicine at London University, England, but had to give it up because of his own ill health. Within a year he moved to Cambridge to take up a scholarship to study Natural Science at Christ's College Cambridge. One of his lecturers at Cambridge was Professor Rayleigh, who clearly had a profound influence on his later work. He graduated from there in 1884 with a Natural Science Tripos (a special course of study at Cambridge). That same year Bose also received the BS degree from London University. Just one year later Bose became a Professor of Physical Science at Presidency College of Calcutta, where for the next 30 years he taught and conducted research. As a teacher Bose was very popular and engaged the interest of his students by making extensive use of scientific demonstrations. Many of his students at the Presidency College were destined to become famous in their own right - for example S.N. Bose, later to become well known for the Bose-Einstein statistics. In 1894, J.e. Bose converted a small enclosure adjoining a bathroom in the Presidency College into a laboratory. He carried out experiments\n\ninvolving refraction, diffraction and polarization. To receive the radiation, he used a variety of different junctions connected to a highly sensitive galvanometer. He plotted in detail the voltage-current characteristics of his junctions, noting their non-linear characteristics. He developed the use of galena crystals for making receivers, both for short wavelength radio waves and for white and ultraviolet light. Patent rights for their use in detecting electromagnetic radiation were granted to him in 1904. In 1954 Pearsonand Brattain gave priority to Bose for the use of a semi-conducting crystal as a detector of radio waves. Sir Neville Mott, Nobel Laureate in 1977for his own contributions to solid-state electronics, remarked that \\\"J.e. Bose was at least 60 years ahead of his time\\\" and \\\"In fact, he had anticipated the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors.\\\" In 1895 Bose gave his first public demonstration of electromagnetic waves, using them to ring a bell remotely and to explode some gunpowder. In 1896 the Daily Chronicle of England reported: \\\"The inventor (J.e. Bose) has transmitted signals to a distance of nearly a mile and herein lies the first and obvious and exceedingly valuable application of this new theoretical marvel.\\\" During the years 1894-1900, Bose performed pioneering research on radio waves and created waves as short as 5 mm. Bose'swork actually predates that of Guglielmo Marconi who is most often associated with the development of radio. Unlike Marconi who sought to commercialize his work with radio waves, Bosewas purely interested in radio waves as a scientific endeavor. Bosealso developed equipment for generating, transmitting, and receiving radio waves and used it to demonstrate conclusively the waves' properties such as reflection, total reflection, refraction, double refraction, and polarization. Bosealso experimented with galena to form an early type of semiconductor diode, which may be used as a detector of electromagnetic waves. Bose'sdemonstration of remote wireless signalling has priority over Marconi; he was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio waves, and he invented various now commonplace microwave components. Outside of India he is rarely given the deserved recognition. Further work at millimeter wavelengths was almost nonexistent for nearly 50 years.\n\nJ.e. Bosewas at least this much ahead of his time. Researchinto the generation and detection of millimeter waves, and the properties of substancesat these wavelengths, was being undertaken in some detail one hundred years ago, by J.e. Bose in Calcutta. After about 1900, Bose began pursuing another longtime interest- animal and plant physiology. This included studies of the effects of electromagnetic radiation on plants, a topical field today. His contributions to this field were pioneering. He introduced many delicate and sensitive instruments, such as the Chrestograph, which was used for recording plant growth. It could magnify a small movement as much as a million times. Another device he developed demonstrated the effects of electromagnetic waves on living and nonliving matter. Boseretired in 1915and was appointed Emeritus Professor,Presidency College, Calcutta, for a period of 5 years. In 1917 he founded the Bose Research Institute in Calcutta which was the first scientific research institute in India. That same year a knighthood was conferred on Bose. In 1920 he became the first Indian scientist to be elected to Great Britain's prestigious Royal Society. Bose traveled frequently to Europe and the United States on various scientific missions and gave lectures on electromagnetic waves, the effects of electromagnetic waves on living and nonliving matter, and plant physiology.On a personal level, Bosebelieved in the free exchange of scientific knowledge and strongly believed that knowledge grows by sharing it with fellow scientists. Bose died on 23 November 1937 at the age of 78.\n\nKALPAM. CHAWLA Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 - 1 February 2003), was an Indian born American astronaut and space shuttle mission specialist. She was one of seven crewmembers killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Kalpana Chawla was born in Karnal, Haryana, India. Kalpana in Sanskrit means \\\"imagination of the mind\\\" and thus also \\\"creation.\\\" Her interest in flying was inspired by J. R. D. Tata, a pioneering Indian pilot and industrialist Kalpana Chawla studied at Tagore Public School, Karnal for her earlier schooling and she pursued further studies aeronautical engineering at Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh, India, in 1982 where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree. She was one of the three women in the college at the time. She moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington (1984). Chawla earned a second Master of Science degree in 1986 and a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Later that year she began working for NASAAmes Research Center as vice president of Overset Methods, Inc. where she did CFD research on V / STOL.Chawla held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multiengine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. She met and married Jean-Pierre Harrison, a flying instructor and aviation writer, in 1983 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1990. Dr. Chawla was hired by MCAT Institute, San Jose, California, as a Research Scientist to support research in the area of powered fin at NASAAmes Research Center, California, in 1988. She was responsible for analysis of flow physics pertaining to the operation of powered lift aircraft such as the Harrier in ground effect. She modeled and\n\nnumerically simulated configurations that include important components of realistic powered lift aircraft both in hover and landing mode, using Navier-Stokessolvers on Cray YMP.Following completion of this project shesupported researchin mapping of flow solvers to parallel computers such as the Intel iPSC-860, the Intel Paragon, and the TMCCM-2, and testing of these solvers by carrying out powered lift computations. In 1993 Dr. Chawla joined Overset Methods Inc., LosAltos, California, as Vice President and Research Scientist to form a team with other researchersspecializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. She was responsible for implementation of efficient techniques to perform aerodynamic optimization. Results of various projects that Dr. Chawla participated in are documented in technical conference papers and Journals. Shewas selected by NASAin December 1994. After completing a year of training and evaluation, she was assigned as crew representative to work technical issues for the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches. Her assignments included work on development of Robotic Situational Awareness Displays and testing space shuttle control software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory. In November, 1996, Kalpana Chawla was assigned as mission specialist and prime robotic arm operator on STS-87. In January 1998, she was assigned as crew representative for shuttle and station flight crew equipment, and subsequently served as lead for Astronaut Office's Crew Systemsand Habitability section. Sheflew on STS-87(1997) and STS-107(2003), logging 30 days, 14hours and 54minutes in space. SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE: STS-87 Columbia (November 19 to December 5, 1997). STS-87was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments designedto study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun's outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) which featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, in addition to testing EVAtools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. STS-87made 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 million miles in in 376 hours and 34 minutes.\n\nSTS-107 Columbia (January 16 to February 1, 2003). The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. The STS-107mission ended abruptly on February1, 2003when SpaceShuttle Columbia and the crew perished during entry, 16 minutes prior to scheduled landing. Posthumously awarded: NASASpace Flight Medal NASADistinguished Service Medal Defense Distinguished Service Medal (DDSM) Congressional Space Medal of Honor KAMARAJ Kamaraj was born on 15th July, 1903, to KumaraswamyNadar and Sivakami Ammal at Virudhunagarnear Madurai in Tamil Nadu. His parents were from a trading family. His real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy, but was affectionately shortened to Raja by his mother, Sivakami Am mal. His father, KumaraswamyNadarwas a coconut merchant. Kamaraj dropped out of school when he was in the sixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his periods of imprisonment. At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the Congress.He invited speakers, organized meetings and collected funds for the party. Kamaraj's political. guru and inspiration was S. Satyamurti, orator and parliamentarian. In 1936, Satyamurti was elected as President of the ProvincialCongressCommittee and he appointed Kamaraj asthe General Secretary.\n\nOnApril 13, 1954, K Kamaraj reluctantly became the Chief Minister of MadrasProvince. Kamaraj removed the family vocation based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. He reopened the 6000 schools closed by previous government for financial reasons and also added 12,000 more schools. The state made immense strides in education and trade. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. He came up with a plan which was called the \\\"Kamaraj Plan\\\". In 1963 he suggested to Nehru that senior congress leaders should leave ministerial posts to take up organizational work. Kamaraj succeeded C. Rajgopalachari, as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on April 13, 1957. On October 2, 1975, Gandhi Jayanti Day, Kamaraj died in his sleep. He was honored with the highest Civilian Honor, the 'Bharat Ratna' posthumously in 1976. Kamaraj's life story had been stronger than fiction for its unbelievable incidents and turn of events, almost an illiterate with no formal education and born in a poor family in a remote village, he rose to great heights of eminence in the political arena.

Amul Jenitha 06/HS/23\n\nKIRAN BED I - A TOUGH LADY IN AN ALL MALE BASTION \\\"I'm here to do my best for the day\\\" - Kiran Bedi Inspirational true life stories are tagged as favorite celebrities for decades. One such well known celebrity around the globe who is recognized for her courage, welfare strategies and tag line 'I Dare' is Kiran Bedi. She dreamt and worked for a better world and she achieved it. She has always been an inspirational icon who has always worn a smile in the battle of life. The first woman to join the coveted Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1972, Kiran Bedi was born on 9 June 1949 in Amritsar, Punjab. Her father Prakash Lal Peshawaria, a landlord in Punjab was determined to educate his four daughters at a time when women were largely limited to doing household tasks. While studying at the Sacred Heart Convent, Kiran joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and took up tennis, a game which her father used to play. After school she went on to study Political Science at the Government College for Women, Amritsar. She loved the subject as she felt it taught her about her role as a citizen of the country. Kiran excelled at sports particularly tennis. She won the inter-University women's team title and bagged the national title as well as the Asian title in tennis. Bedi says the game taught her the value of hard work, the importance of staying fit and built in her the qualities of fair play, team work, concentration, and the ability to give in that extra bit under stress. She began her career as a Lecturer in Political Science (1970-72) at Khalsa College for Women, Amritsar, India. In July 1972, she joined the Indian Police Service. She served in a number of tough assignments ranging from Traffic\n\nCommissoner of New Delhi, Deputy Inspector General of Police in insurgency prone Mizoram, Advisor to the Lieutanent Governor of Chandigarh, Director General of Narcotics Control Bureau and also on a United Nations deputation, she served as Police Advisor in the United Nations peacekeeping department and was honored with the UN medal for outstanding service. She earned the nickname 'Crane Bedi' for towing away the then Indian PM Indira Gandhi's car for parking violation. She was last appointed as Director General of India's Bureau of Police Research and Development. Sheis well known for introducing a number of reforms during her stint as the Inspector General of Prisons of the Tihar Jail in New Delhi like detoxification programmes, yoga, meditation and redressal of prisoners' complaints. For her effort to humanize the Tihar jail she was honored with the 1994 Ramon MagsaysayAward. She has won a number of awards both in India and abroad. The prominent ones among include the President's Gallantry Award in 1979, the Asia Region Award for Drug Prevention and Control in 1991, the Joseph Beuys Award in 1997, the Mother Teresa Memorial National Award for Social Justice in 2005 and the Serge Soitiroff Memorial Award for drug abuse prevention by the United Nations. Shewas last appointed as Director General of India's Bureau of Police Researchand Development. In May 2005, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Law In recognition of her \\\"humanitarian approach to prison reforms and policing\\\". On 27th November2007, she had expressed her wish to take Voluntary Retirement from job to take up new challengesin life.On 25th December 2007, Government of India decided to relieve Bedi, who was holding the post of the director general of Bureau of Police Research and Development, from her duties immediately. Not everyone loves this gutsy woman though. Kiran Bedi has been often criticized for being \\\"media-hungry\\\" and controversial. Often, she has been transferred out of offices for trying to turn things around. But despite these minor complaints, Kiran Bedi remains one of the most inspiring Indian public figures.\n\nKIRANDESAI Kiran Desai was born in India in 1971, she lived in Delhi until she was 14, then spent a year in England, before her family moved to the USA. She completed her schooling in Massachusetts before attending Bennington College; Hollins University and Columbia University, where she studied creative writing, taking two years off to write Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard. Her mother is Anita Desai, author of many books, three of which have been short listed for the Booker Prize (Clear Ught ot Day (1980), In Custody (1984) and Fasting, Feasting (1999). Anita Desai currently teaches writing at MIT. Her maternal grandmother was German, but left before the World War\\\" and never returned. Her grandfather was a refugee from Bangledesh. Her paternal grandparents came from Gujarat, and her grandfather was educated in England. Although Kiran has not lived in India since she was 14, she returns to the family home in Delhi every year. She first came to literary attention in 1997 when she was published in the New Yorker and in Mirrorwork, an anthology of 50 years of Indian writing edited by Salman Rushdie - Strange Happenings in the Guava Orchard was the closing piece. In 1998, Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard, which had taken four years to write, was published to good reviews. She says, \\\"I think my first book was filled with all that I loved most about India and knew I was in the inevitable process of losing. It was also very much a book that came from the happiness of realizing how much I loved to write.\\\" Eight years later, The Inheritance of Loss was published in early 2006, and won the 2006 Booker Prize. When talking of the characters in The Inheritance of Loss, and of her own life, she says, \\\"The characters of my story are entirely fictional, but these journeys (of her grandparents) as well as my own provided insight into what it means to travel between East and West and it is this I wanted to capture. The fact that I live this particular life is no accident. It was my inheritance.\\\"\n\nThe Inheritance of Loss is set partly in India and partly in the USA. Desai describes it as a book that \\\"tries to capture what it means to live between East and West and what it means to be an immigrant,\\\" and goes on to say that it also explores at a deeper level, \\\"what happens when a Western element is introduced into a country that is not of the West\\\" - which happened during the British colonial days in India, and is happening again \\\"with India's new relationship with the States.\\\" Her third aim was to write about, \\\"What happens when you take people from a poor country and place them in a wealthy one. How does the imbalance between these two worlds change a person's thinking and feeling? How do these changes manifest themselves in a personal sphere, a political sphere, over time?\\\" As she says, \\\"These are old themes that continue to be relevant in today's world, the past informing the present, the present revealing the past. KISHORB KUMAR - THE LEGEND. Kishore Kumar (August 4, 1929 - October 13, 1987) was an Indian film playback singer and comic actor. He also achieved notable successes as a lyricist, composer, producer, director, screenwriter and scriptwriter. Kishore Kumar has sung in many Indian languages including Hindi, Bengali (his mother tongue), Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam and Oriya. Along with Mohammed Rafi , and Mukesh, he was one of the three leading male Bollywood playback singers from the 1950s to the mid-1 980s. He holds the record for most number of Filmfare Awards won for Best Male Playback Singer. He was on the top of his sin ging career when tragedy struck the music world in October 1987. He passed away due to massive heart attack. By this time he and his talented son Amit Kumar were ruling the playback singing in Bollywood and Bengali films.\n\nAfter Ashok Kumar became a BoUywood star, the Ganguli family used to visit Mumbai regularly. Abhas Kumar changed his name to Kishore Kumar and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies, where Ashok Kumar was a star. His first film as an actor was Shikad (1946), in which Ashok Kumar played the lead role. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave him a chance to sing the song Marne ki duayen kyon mangu for the film Ziddi (1948). After this, Kishore Kumar got many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career. In 1949, he decided to settle in Mumbai. Kishore Kumar played hero in the Bombay Talkies film Andolan (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. Although Kishore Kumar got some assignments as an actor with help of his brother, he was more interested in becoming a successful singer. He was not interested in acting, but his elder brother Ashok Kumar wanted him to be an actor like himself. As an actor, Kishore Kumar worked with many notable directors. He played an unemployed young man seeking a job, in Bimal Roy's Naukri (1954) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's directorial debut Musafjr (1957). Salil Chowdhury, the music director for Naukri was initially dismissive of him as a singer, when he came to know that Kishore Kumar didn't have any formal training in music. However, after hearing his voice, he gave him the song Chhota sa ghar hoga, which was supposed to be sung by Hemant Kumar. After some initial flops as an actor, Kishore Kumar achieved success as a comic hero with movies like New Delhi (1956), Aasha (1957), ChaLti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Jhumroo (1961), Half Ticket (1962), and Padosan (1968). Chait! Ka Naam Gaadi, his home production, starred the three Ganguli brothers, and Madhubala (whom Kishore married later). Music director S. D. Burman is credited with spotting Kishore Kumar's talent as a singer, and advancing his singing career. During the making of Mashaal (1950), Burman visited Ashok Kumar's house, where he heard Kishore imitating the singer K L Saigal in the bathroom. He complimented Kishore, but also told him that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal. Kishore Kumar did not have a formal training in music. Initially, he used to copy K. L. Saigal. But, he kept Burman's advice in mind, and eventually developed his own style of singing.\n\nS. D. Burman recorded with Kishore for Dev Anand's Munimji (1954), Taxi Driver(1954), House No 44 (1955), Funtoosh (1956), Nau Do Gyarah (1957), Paying Guest (1957), Guide (1965), Jewel Thief (1967), Prem Pujari (1970), and Tere Mere Sapne (1971). He also composed music for Kishore Kumar's home production Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958). Some of their initial hits included Maana janaab ne pukara nahin from Paying Guest, Hum hain raahi pyar ke from Nau Do Gyarah (1957), Ai meri topi palat ke aa from Funtoosh, and Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si and Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka from Ctiaiti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958). When S. D. Burman was not in good terms with Lata Mangeshkar during 1957-62, he gave patronage to her younger sister, Asha Bhosle. The Asha Bhosle-KishoreKumar duets composed by S. D. Burman also became very popular. Some of these include Chhod Do Aanchal from Paying Guest (1957), Ankhon Mein Kya Ji from Nau Do Gyarah (1957), Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka and Paanch Rupaiya Baara Aana from Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Chhedo Na Meri Zulfein from Ganga Ki Lahren (1964), and Arre Yaara Meri Tuma Bhi Ho Gajab from Teen Devian (1965). C. Ramchandra was another music director who recognized Kishore Kumar's talent as a singer. One of the most popular C. Ramchandra- Kishore Kumar hits is Eena Meena Deeka from Aasha (1957). Kishore Kumar also gave a few hit songs with other music directors; for example, Nakhrewaali from New Delhi (1956 by Shankar Jaikishan, and CA. T.Cat Maane Billi and Hum To Mohabbat Kareqa from Dilli Ka Thug (1958 by Ravi). Kishore Kumar produced, directed, and acted in the film Jhumroo (1961). He wrote the lyrics for the title song, Main Hoon Jhumroo, and composed music for all the songsin the film. Later, he produced and directed the serious film Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein (1964). He also wrote the script and composed music for the film. In the 1960s, as an actor, Kishore Kumar build up a notoriety for coming late for the shootings, or bunking them altogether. His films flopped frequently, and he also landed in income-tax trouble. As a singer, he had some hit songs to his credit, including Zaroorat Hai Zaroorat Hai from Manmauji (1961), Gaata Rahe Mera Dil from Guide (1964), and Yeh dil na hota bechara from Jewel Thief (1967). In the late 1960s, S. D. Burman's son; Rahul Dev Burman also started patronizing Kishore Kumar. Their first notable success was the\n\nsoundtrack of the film Padosan (1968), in which Kishore Kumar sang popular songsMere Saamne waat! khidki mein and Kehna hai. Padosan was a comedy film staring Kishore Kumar as a dramatist-musician, Mehmood as a Carnatic music and dance teacher, and Sunil Dutt as a simpleton called Bhola. Kishore Kumar's character in the film was inspired by the personality of his uncle, DhananjayBanerjee (a classical singer). The highlight of the film was a musical, comical duel between Kishore Kumar-SunilDutt and Mehmood, \\\"Ek Chaturnar Karke Singaar\\\". In 1969, Shakti Samanta produced and directed the film Aradhana, for which the music was composed by S. D. Burman. S. D. Burman fell ill after recording some duet songswith Mohammed Rafi, Asha Bhosale, Lata Mangeshkarand Kishore Kumar. Afterwards, his son and assistant R. D. Burman took over the recording. R. D. Burman got Kishore Kumar to solo sing the songs Mere Sapno Ki Rani and Roop Tera Mastana, which became smash hits. Kishore Kumar won his first Filmfare award for the song Roop Tera Mastana. Kishore Kumar sang for all leading actors in 1970s, including Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, DevAnand, and Rishi Kapoor. S. D.

In 1975, S. D. Burman composed his last song for Kishore Kumar. S. D. Burman went into a coma for the second time; soon after Kishore recorded the song Badi Sooni Sooni Si Hai lindagi for the film Mili. R. D. Burman considered Kishore Kumar his favorite singer, and recorded several hit songs with him in the 1970s. In the superhit Bollywood film, Sholay (1975), he asked Kishore Kumar to sing for both Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra. Some popular songs of Kishore Kumar-R.D.Burman include 0 Maajhee Re from Khushboo, Yeh Shaam Mastaani and Yeh jo mohabbat hai from Kati Patang (1971), Kuchh to log kahenge from Amar Prem (1972), Raat Kali Ek Khwab Mein Aayee from Buddha Mil Gaya (1971), Musafir hoon yaaron from Parichaya (1972), Diye ja/te hain from Namak Haraam (1973), Meree bbeegee bheegee si from Anamika (1973), lindagee Ke Safar Mein from Aap Ki Kasam (1974), Agar Tum Na Hote, Humein Tum Se Pyaar Kitna,\n\ni i Mere Naina Saawan Bahado, and Chingari Koi Bhadke.

Some of these duets include Panna Ki Tamana from Heera Panna (1973), Neend Chura Ke Raaton Mein from the film Shareef Badmash, Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai from Sanjay Dutt's debut film Rocky (1981). Apart from the Burmans, Kishore Kumar worked with other major music directors as well. The composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal (L-P) also composed many hit songs sung by Kishore Kumar. Kalyanji-Anandji recorded several hit songs with Kishore Kumar including Zindagi Ka Safar from Safar, Pal Pal Oil Ke Paas from Black Mail, Apne Jeevan Ki Uljhan from Uljhan, Mera Jeevan Kora Kagaz from Kora Kagaz, 0 Saathi Re from Muqaddar Ka Sikander, Khaike Paan Banaraswala from Don, Neele Neele Ambar Par from Kalakar and Pal Bhar Ke Liye from Johny Mera Naam.

Their other hits include Chhookar mere man ko from Yaarana and Tune abhi dekha nahin from Do Aur Do Paanch. Bappi Lahiri also recorded many popular songs with Kishore Kumar, including Pag Ghunghroo from Namak Halal (1982), Manzilen Apni Jagah Hai from Sharaabi (1984) and Chaite chaite (1976). During the Indian Emergency, Sanjay Gandhi asked Kishore Kumar to sing for a Congress rally in Mumbai, but Kishore Kumar refused. As a result, the Government put a ban on playing Kishore Kumar songs on the All India Radio or television. But Kishore Kumar refused to apologize. Finally, the ban was lifted after some prominent producers and directors lobbied against it. Kishore Kumar produced and directed some movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as Badhti Ka Naam Daadhi (1978), Zindagi (1981) and Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin (1982). But none of these films did well at the box-office. His last appearance as an actor was in Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin. With patronage from R. D. Burman and Rajesh Roshan Kishore Kumar's son Amit Kumar also became a leading Bollywood singer in the 1980s.\n\nKishore Kumar also continued singing for several actors. In mid-1980s, Kishore Kumar sang for Anil Kapoor in his Kapoor's debut film, Woh Saat Din and also recorded for his first superhit Mr. India. He also recorded some popular songs for the film Saagar with R. D. Burman. By this time, he had decided to retire and was planning to go back to his birthplace, Khandwa. However, on October 13 1987, he died of a heart attack in Mumbai. His body was taken to Khandwa for cremation. He recorded his last song a day before he died. The song was Guru o Guru, a duet with Asha Bhosle, for the film Waqt ki Aawaz (1988) composed by Bappi Lahiri for Mithun Chakraborty. Kishore Kumar's voice inspired many upcoming Bollywood singers, including Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet, Vinod Rathod and Babul Supriyo. After his death, many of his songs have been remixed and re-sung by several artists. Kishore Kumar's song Pal Bhar Ke Uye from the film Johny Mera Naam (1970) was used in an episode of The Simpsons titled Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore. His songs have also been featured in several films, including Such a Long Journey (1998) and Side Streets (1998). Ruehi M Jain 06/HS/26\n\nlATA MANGBSHKAK fu- Lata Mangeshkar is one of the best-known Meena Mangeshkar. playback singers in the Hindi movie industry. Man geshkar's career started in 1942 and has spanned over six and a half decades. She has sung in over 980 Bollywood movies and in over twenty regional Indian languages. She is the elder sister of the equally accomplished singer Asha Bhosle and lesser-known singers Hrid ayanath Mangeshkar, Usha Mangeshkar and Lata is the second vocalist ever to have received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian hon our. Lata Mangeshkar was born in a Konkani family in Sikh Mohalla, Indore, which then used to be in Central India Agency and is now in the State of Madhya Pradesh. Her father, Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theater actor. Her mother, Shudhhamati, was Deenanath's second wife. The family's last name used to be Hardikar; Deenanath changed it to Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town, Mangeshi in Goa. Lata was named \\\"Hema\\\" at her birth and she was later renamed Lata by her parents after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, BhaawBandhan. Lata is the eldest child of her parents. Hridayanath, Asha, Usha, and Meena are her siblings in sequence. Lata took her first music lessons from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (sangeet naatak in Marathi). Her father's recitals and lessons left a strong impression on her, as did the songs of K.L. Saigal, who was her favorite singer and idol. He r formal education was limited to one day in the school. On the first day in the school, she started teaching songs to other children. When the teacher stopped her, she was so angry that she stopped goi ng to the school. In 1942, when Lata was 13. her father died of heart disease. Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped Lata get started in a career as a singer and actress.\n\nLata moved to Mumbai in 1945 when Master Vinayak's company moved its headquarters there. She started taking lessonsin Hindustani classical music from Ustad Amanat Ali Khan Bhendibazaarwale. Following the Partition of India in 1947, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan Bhendibazaarwale migrated to newly formed Pakistan, so Lata started to learn classical music under Amanat Khan Devaswale. Pandit Tulsidas Sharma, a pupil of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, also trained her. After Master Vinayak's death in 1948, music director Ghulam Haider mentored Lata as a singer. Initially, Lata imitated Noor Jehan, who was then the most popular singer, but later she developed her own style of singing. In that period, lyrics of songs in Hindi movies were primarily composed by Muslim poets and contained a higher proportion of Hindustani words. Actor Dilip Kumar once made a mildly disapproving remark about Lata's Maharashtrian accent while singing Hindi/Hindustani songs; so for a period of time, Lata took lessonsin Hindustani from a maulavi, Shafi. \\\"AayegaAanewaala,\\\" a song in the popular movie Mahal (1949) proved a turning point for her. Salil Chowdhury was among Lata's favorite composers during the 1950s. She won her first Filmfare Best Female PlaybackAward for Chowdhury's composition \\\"Aaja RePardesi,\\\" from Madhumati (1958). In 1961, Mangeshkartook the first step on the road to reconciliation with S. D. Burman, as she recorded a bhajan, Allah Tero Naam, for Burman's assistant, Jaidev. In 1962, she bagged her second Filmfare Award for the song Kahin Deep Jale Kahin Oil from Bees 5aal Baad, composed by Hemant Kumar. On June 27, 1963, with the backdrop of the Indo-China war, Lata Mangeshkarsangthe patriotic song Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon (literally, Oh the People of my Country) in presence of Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of India. This song, composed by C. Ramchandra and written by Pradeep, is said to have brought him to tears. In 1963, Mangeshkarreturned to collaborate with S. D. Burman, mainly as a result of a truce brokered by Burman's son and assistant (and her future brother-in-law) R. D. Burman. She recorded several popular songs for S. D. Burman, including Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai, Gata Rahe Mera Oil (duet with Kishore Kumar) and Piya Tose from Guide (1965), and Hothon Pe Aisi Baat from Jewel Thief (1967). 7\n\nIn 1973, she won the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the song Beeti Na Bitai from the film Parichay, composed by R. D. Burman, and written by Gulzar. In 1975, she again won the same award, this time for the song Roothe Roothe Piya from the film Kora Kagaz, composed by Kalyanji-Anandji. From 1970s onwards, Lata Mangeshkar has staged many concerts in India and abroad, including several charity concerts. Her first concert overseas was at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1974. She also released an album of Mirabai's bhajans, Chala Vaahi Des, composed by her brother Hridayanath Mangeshkar. Some of the bhajans in the album include Saanware Rang Raachi and Ud Jaa Re Kaaga. In late 1970s and early 1980s, she worked with the children of composers she had earlier worked with. Some of these composers included RahulDev Burman (son of SachinDev Burman), Rajesh Roshan (son of Roshan), Anu Malik (son of Sardar Malik), and Anand-Milind (sons of Chitragupt). In 1990, Mangeshkar launched her own production house for Hindi movies. In 1999, Lata Eau De Parfurn, a perfume brand named after her, was launched. In 1999, she was nominated as a member of Rajya Sabha. However,she did not attend the Rajya Sabhasessionsregularly, inviting criticism from several members of the House, including the Deputy Chairperson Najma Heptullah, PranabMukherjee and Shabana Azmi. She stated the reason for her absence as ill-health; it was also reported that she had not taken a salary, allowance or a house in Delhi for being a Member of Parliament. In 2001, Lata Mangeshkar was awarded Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. In the same year, she established the Master Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital in Pune, managed by the Lata Mangeshkar Medical Foundation (founded by the Mangeshkarfamily in October 1989). In 2005, she designed a jewellery collection called Swaranjali, which was crafted by Adora, an Indian diamond export company. Five pieces from the collection raised £1,05,000 at a Christie's, and a part of the money was donated for the 2005 Pakistan earthquake relief.\n\nDHYAN CHAND Major Dhyan Chand Singh (Aug 29, 1905 - Dec 3, 1979) was a former Indian Hockey player. Dhyan Chand was born to a Rajput family in Prayag in Uttar Pradesh. His Hockey career had humble beginnigns. Dhyan and other youngsters used to cut off branches of a date palm tree and remove the leaves. This would be their improvised hockey stick. From old rags, they would make a ball. After an early education, he joined the army at the age of 16 in 1922 as a Sepoy of the 41st Punjab Regiment and soon took to hockey despite a childhood fascination for wrestling. He quickly came to acquire dribbling skills and soon his coach gave him the name \\\"Chand\\\" because he predicted that Dhyan would one day shine like a \\\"Chand\\\" (Moon). He was also known as the \\\"Hockey Wizard\\\". It was during his career as a hockey player that the Indian Hockey team was feared by other teams. He was part of the Gold-medal winning team in 3 Olympic games - 1928, Amsterdam; 1932, Los Angeles and 1936, Berlin. India's gold medals in Olympic games came only from the hockey team for many years until the recent success of other athletes. During the Berlin Olympics (1936), Hitler was very much impressed by Dhyan Chand and in fact offered him the position of \\\"Field Marshall\\\" in the German army. Dhyan Chand, however, turned down the offer. In 1956, at the age of 51, he retired from the army with the rank of Major. The Government of India honoured him that year with the Padma Bhushan (India's )Cd highest civilian award). After his retirement, Dhyan Chand earned a diploma in coaching from the National Institute of Sports in Patiala, Punjab. He died on December 3, 1979 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital after a brief illness. Austria honoured him by erecting a statue of him in Vienna with four hands and and four sticks depicting his control and mastery over the ball. His other statues are at the National Stadium near India Gate, New Delhi and at Medak in Andhra Pradesh. The Indian Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in his honour after his death. Dhyan Chand National Stadium in New Delhi is named in his honour. His\n\nbirthday (29th August) is celebrated as the National Sports Day in India. The President gives away sports awards such as the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award on this day. To commemorate him, the Government hasinstituted the Dhyan ChandAward which is presented to those sportspersonswho not only contribute while playing actively but also after their retirement. Though Indian hockey is in dire straits today, it was Dhyan Chand who single-handedly created fo •...the sport and for India, a great name in the international arena. He is to be honoured as one of India's most talented personalities. Rajkumari Barbina 06/HS/24\n\nMFHUSAIN A self-taught artist, Muqbool Fida Husain was born in 1915 in Maharashtra. At an earLy age he learnt the art of calligraphy and practiced the Kulfic khat with its geometric forms. He also learnt to write poetry while staying with an uncle in a madrasa in Baroda, an art that has stayed with him through his life. His early education was perfunctory but Husain's love for drawing was evident even at this stage. Whenever he got a chance he would strap his painting gear to his bicycle and drive out to the surrounding countryside of Indore to paint the landscape. In 1937 he reached Mumbai determined to become an artist, with hardly any money and lived in a cheap room in a by lane inhabited by pimps and prostitutes. Initially Husainapprenticed himself to a painter of cinema hoardings which he would paint with great dexterity perched on scaffolding sometimes in the middLe of traffic. Husain was noticed for the first time in 1947 when he won an award at the annual exhibition of the Bombay Art Society. Subsequently he was invited by Souza to join the ProgressiveArtist's Group. A great deal of experimentation in the early years led to some remarkable works Re Between The Spider And The Lamp, Zameen and Man. By 1955 he was one of the leading artists in India and had been awarded the PadmaShri. He was a special invitee along with Pablo Picassoat the Sao Paulo Biennial in 1971. Along with several solo exhibitions he had major retrospectives in Mumbai in 1969, in Calcutta in 1973 and in Delhi in 1978. He has participated in many international shows which include Contemporary Indian Art, RoyalAcademy of Arts, London 1982; Six Indian Painters, Tate Gallery, London 1985; Modern Indian Painting, Hirschhom Museum, Washington 1986 and Contemporary Indian Art, Grey Art Gallery, New York 1986. In 1967 he won the Golden Bear at the International Film Festival at BerLin for his documentary Through the Eyes of a Painter and has made several short films since then. Husain was awarded the Padma Bhushanin 1973, the Padma Vibhushan in 1989 and was nominated to the Rajya Sabhain 1986. One of the most charismatic artists in India today, he is known for his emphatic understanding of the human situation and his speedy evocation of it in paint. The early evolution of his painterly language was overtaken by adventurous forays into installations and performance art. Hisexperimentations with new forms of art are both unexpected and pioneering. Husain hasstudios in several cities in India but lives mainly in Mumbai.\n\nSArUA MIRZA Mirza was born to a sports journalist Imran Mirza and Nasima in Mumbai. She was brought up in Hyderabad.

He became one of the most respected spiritual and political leaders of the 1900s. Gandhiji helped free the Indian people from British rule through non violent resistance. He is honoured as the Father of the Nation. The people around him titled Gandhiji \\\"Mahatma\\\", meaning Great Soul. At the age of 13, Gandhiji married Kasturba. He studied law in London and returned to India in 1891 to practice. Soon, he took a one year contract to South Africa, to do legal work for Indians settled there. At the time, the British controlled most of South Africa. When he attempted to claim his rights as a British subject, he was abused\n\nand he soon saw that all Indians suffered similar treatment. Gandhiji, therefore stayed in South Africa for 21 years, working to secure rights for the Indian people. He developed a method of Action, basedon the principles of courage and non-violence called Satyagraha. He believed that the way people behaved was more important than what they achieved. Satyagraha promoted non-violence and civil disobedience as the most appropriate methods for obtaining political and social goals. In 1915, Gandhiji returned to India. Within years, he became the leader of the Indian Nationalist movement. The most important element that Gandhiji added to the Indian freedom struggle was that of mass participation. His Non-Cooperation, Civil Disobedience and Quit India movements were all movements that involved everyone from the poorest peasant to the richest barrister. Gandhiji was arrested many times during this period. He believed it was the honourable thing to go to jail, if one's conscience could not bring itself to obey a law set down by the government. More than once, Gandhiji also used fasting to impress upon others the need to be nonviolent. During the period of Indian Freedom struggle, the physical, spiritual and mental person of Gandhiji underwent great change as he shed his barrister's clothing for that of the simple peasant, and took ill very often owing to his fasts and jail terms. His spirit, however, only grew as the presence of Gandhiji spread reassurance and hope all over India and shook the foundations of the British Empire. Gandhiji's fasts increased especially in the last daysof freedom struggle when the demandfor Pakistan became very strong, as riots and murders had begun to occur very often in most cities in the North West and Bengat. Gandhiji, an advocate for a peaceful India where Muslims and Hindus lived together in peace, spent his time traveling from village to village, trying to calm down mobs and prevent further slaughter. On 30th January 1948, at the age of 78, Gandhiji was assassinatedby Nathuram Godse, a Hindu fundamentalist, who had been enraged by Gandhiji's equal support for the Muslims. As Nehru said, \\\"a light had gone out\\\". Gandhiji's legacy, however remains and continues to be a guiding force in modern India."
