Overall Winners at the . Culturals. December 2009\n\nMRINALINI SARABHAI Mrinalini Sarabhai is a celebrated dancer and choreographer and has achieved an international reputation that is unmatched by any contemporary Indian classical dancer. The syntax of her creativity mediates between a moral commitment to traditional form and the desire to claim one's own experiments as unique, unrepeatable. The creative anarchy of her essentially modern style is convincingly disciplined by the taut orthodoxy of her classical technique, learnt from her guru Sri Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai. The result is an exalted visual statement combining almost fanatical purity of vision with modish formal experiments. She is the founder-director of the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts, Ahmedabad, which came into being in 1949. She has traveled extensively all over the world and has received many distinguished national and international awards and citations for her contribution to the preservation of Indian classical dance.

She was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the President of India in 1992 and the Scroll of Honour by the Vice-President of India in 1995 in recognition of decades-long research, experimentation and presentation of Indian classical and creative dance choreographic creations. She was awarded the Kerala Kalamandalam Fellowship in 1995 and the Kalidas Samman by the Madhya Pradesh Government in 1996 for her contribution to Classical Dance.

He was born on October 27, 1920, but his uncle, who accompanied him on his first day in school, did not know his actual date of birth, and arbitrarily chose October 27, 1920 for the records; Narayanan later chose to let it remain official. Narayanan had his early schooling in Uzhavoor at the Government Lower Primary School, Kurichithanam and Our Lady of Lourdes Upper Primary School, Uzhavoor (1931-35).

Her parents were Neelakanta Sastri and Seshammal. It was only after her family moved from Chengalpet to Chennai that Rukmini began attending regular school. Shespent most of her time on the grounds of the theosophical society slowly, Rukmini was drawn to art, nature and animals. She had occupied a niche in the arena of Indian culture. Her powerful personality, her contribution to the renaissanceof Bharatanatyam and her creation of Kalakshetra, the world - renowned temple of arts in Chennai earned for her great admiration. Less widely known is her work for animal welfare and vegetarianism long before either of these causes became fashionable. Interestingly, after the controversial marriage to George Arundale when she was 16, it was western ballet that first caught Rukmini's fancy. She turned to Indian dance only when the ballerina Anna Pavlova advised her to look at the native arts of India for inspiration. Rukmini was introduced to Bharatnatyam by E. Krishna Iyer, founder - secretary of the Madras Music Academy. During the 1930's he taught a successful battle to save the dance which seemed likely to be buried along with the disfavoured devadasi system. It has been a shibboleth among the region of Rukmini's admirers that it was she was saved Bharatnatyam from oblivion. The dance had been revived and most of the dark clouds of social prejudice had been blown away by the time Rukmini gave her first performance in 1935. Given her upper-class Brahmin background Iyer had rightly anticipated that Rukmini'sentry into Bharatnatyamwould further dilute social ostracism of the community of dancers. Rukmini herself gave credence to the view that she had \\\"reconstructed\\\" the dance of the devadasis by making it respectable. Nonetheless, she should be remembered for her contributions that she made to her presentation and propagation of Bharatnatyam. She set up kalakshetra which provided an institutional setting for the students of music and dance. Hundreds of students found it as a heaven of opportunity to learn the traditional arts. Shepioneered the use of the dance-drama formed for persecuting Bharatnatyam and sophisticated versions of folk and devotional dances. In her last year she worked unflaggingly for the institution. Her vision to build a theatre modeled on the Kerala Koothambalam had been\n\nfulfilled. She was a motivator who encouraged her students to learn in order to continue the process and become teachers. She stands out as a personality, rare as an exotic orchid in the 20th century history of Indian performing arts. She passed on February 23rd 1986 at the age of 82. DHIRAJIL HIRACHAND AM BAN I Early Life Dhirajil Hirachand Ambani was born on 28th December 1932, at Chorwad in Gujarat. His father was a teacher and he was from an ordinary Indian family. He was the founder of Reliance Industries. He was a man who started from zero and built his own empire. He should be an acceptable example of hard worker and a winner. He used to say \\\"growth has no limit at Reliance. I keep reversing my vision. Only when you dream it you can do it\\\". His famous quotes includes \\\"Give the youth a proper environment. Motivate them. Extend them the support they need. Each one of them has infinite source of energy. They will deliver. At the age of 16, he started working as a dispatch for a company called A. Besse &. Co. After completing two years he was promoted as the manager for their oil filling station at Aden. He returned to India in 1958 to launch his first business venture a spice trading company named Reliance Commercial Corporation. Growth of Ambani In 1962, Dhirubhai identified an emerging opportunity in yarn trading and shifted to the new business. Three years later he changed the name of his company to Reliance Textile Industries limited. In 1966, he purchased land in Baroda, Gujarat, to set up a textile mill. A technical team from the World Bank recognized the Baroda mill as one of the best composite textile mills in India and certified it as excellent even by developed country standards'. In 1977, the company went public. At the time of the Reliance Textiles IPO, participation in the Indian capital markets was largely limited to a small but influential elite which dabbled in a handful of stocks. The great majority of\n\nIndia's middle class chose to stay away. Dhirubhai's decision to prefer the capital markets over banks as the primary source of funding for his ambitious expansion plans was as daring as it was unprecedented. Dhirubhai managed to convince a sufficiently large number of sceptical middle class investors to put their money, and faith, in what was then a small, relatively unknown company. It was one of Dhirubhai's great dreams in life to see ordinary Indians enjoy the enormous economic benefits of being able to access affordable yet world class telecommunications infrastructure. He wanted Reliance to spearhead a communications revolution that would dramatically cut down the cost of connectivity and propel India into the digital age. Dhirubhai's Companies Anil Dhirubhai Ambani's companies are Reliance Communications, Reliance Energy, Reliance General Insurance, Reliance Life Insurance, RelianceMutual Fund, Reliance Capital, RelianceHealth. Today,Reliance communications is India's largest information and communications services provider with over 20 million subscribers and offers the full range of integrated telecom services - at prices that are by far the lowest anywhere in the world.

Think fast. Think Ahead\\\". We will think bigger. We will think faster. But, most important of all, we will think better to stay ahead of competition and of our times. MAD~SHANMUGAVADWUSU88U~HMI M.S. Subbulakshmi was born in the temple town of Madurai on September 16th 1916. Her tiny home was close to the Meenakshi temple. Shehasvocally rendered someof the rare and singular gamakas and 'prayogas' on both veena and nadaswaram. The family was rich only in music. That was all the wealth they had. Mother Shanmukavadivu wanted to start a formal training for M.S in vocal music. Her formal schooling was stopped in the 5th grade, but she practiced music for long hours, lost in the vibrations of the Thambura, which she would tune reverently. Shehad a fascination for mridangam, which she learnt to play from brother Sakthivel. She released her first disc at the age of ten. The songs were 'Marakata Vadivu' and 'Oothukuzhiyinile' in an impossibly high pitch. Infact it was through the Columbia gramophone company records she was first noticed in the city of Madras before she was in her teens. The voice had a childish treble, but there was no hesita tion. By 1932, MS had already became a sort of cult figure to a whole generation of young singers. YoungMS learnt music from her mother and her first guru was Madurai Srinivasa Iyengar the great musicians of her time. Women musicians were not taken seriously in those days. There was a feeling, until then, that women sangprincipally to attract male attention. Sheessayed into serious elaborations of Ragaswithout appropriately being aware that she was breaking fresh ground as a female vocalist. An exposition of dance and music was arranged in 1993 at Kumbakonam. Magazines especially like Ananda Vikatan had reviewed her performances regularly as Nightingale. M.S married Sadasivamwho was a fairly known figure in Madras Congress circle and also a protege of Rajaji. M.S acted in four movies such as\n\nSevasadanam, Sakunthalai, Savithri, ft Bakthameera. In 1944 M.S Started conducting benefit performances to collect funds for a variety of social and religious causes. In 1947, Mahatma Gandhi, had sent word to M.S. to sing 'Bhajans' for him. She sent him a recorded version of ' Hari Tuma Haro' She became an accepted and integral part of the Madraselitist society. M.S gave a concert at the Edinburgh festival and at the United Nations. M.S has traveled all over the world. She was awarded the MagsaysayAward in the year 1982. M.S was a great philanthropist. M.S.hasa saintly image, which will probably endure long after this century, just as in the case of \\\"Meerabai\\\". M.S. links her art with the spiritual quest, where modesty and perseverance assures the 'sadhaka' of grace. MANORAMA (ACHI MANORAMA) Manorama was born on 26th May 1943.

Kapil Dev played his first competitive game of cricket at the age of 13. In chandigarh he used to be a regular spectator to watch the inter - sector matches. One Sunday the sector 16 team fell one player short and Kapil who had gone to watch the match was taken in as a replacement. The sector 26team boasted of 3 players who had played Ranji Trophy cricket for Haryana. The young Kapil Dev impressed them with his attitude and talent and became a regular member of the side. His family noticing his passion for the game encouraged him to take up the game serious ly. His elder brother gave him lots of encouragement and at age 24, Kapil started playing for Dav School. He was coached by Desh Prem Azad, a well known cricket coach in Chandigarh. At the age of 15, Kapil Dev was invited to attend a line- in coaching camp in Bombay. The camp held at the cricket club of India was conducted by Hemu Adhikari who also was an ex. India test cricketer. Kapil Dev made his first class debut in November 1975 at the age of 17. He played for his home state Haryana against neighboring state of Punjab. His performance in this match was very impressive as he got 6 wickets for just 39 runs. In another top class performance he picked up 8/36 against Jammu and Kashmir. His 7 for 20 against Bengal and 8 for 38 against services are considered to be one of the best bowling performances in the Indian domestic cricket.\n\nKapil Dev made his Test debut on 16th Oct 1978 at Faisalabad against Pakistan. His bowling in the first innings was disappointing as he had figures of 0171 from 16 ove r s. In the second innings he bowled better and got his first test wicket that of Sadiq Mohammad. India was comprehensively beaten in that services but it saw the emergence of kapil Dev as a talented fast bowler and an all rounder. He learned a lot in this series and modified his action on the advice of Sunil Gavaskar and started bowling from close to the stumps to make his out swingers more effective and lethal. He also performed creditably with the bat and made some useful scores in the middle order. His best batting performance was the innings of 59 in 48 balls, which included two sixes and eight fours in the third test at Karachi. Till he retired in mid 90's kapil Dev was one of the leading all rounder in the game. He held the record for the most number of test and one- day wickets for quite a long time till Courtney Walsh and wasim Akram took over respectively. Captaining India to win the world Cup in 1983 was the high light of his illustrious career. Other highlights include leading India to a 2-0 services win against a strong England in 1986. His unbeaten innings of 175 against Zimbabwe in the world cup in 1983 when India were tottering at 17/5 and his 4 successive sixes of Eddie innings in the first innings of the lords test in 1990 to get the 24 runs needed to avoid the follow on are now part of cricketing folk lore. His super human match wining efforts with the ball in the Melbourne Test of 1980 against Australia in which he bowled non stop for 3 hours with injectior.s for a torn hamstring and a pulled groin muscle is still remembered about this hero.\n\nRABINDRANATH TAooRE Greatest writer in modern Indian literature, poet, novelist, undoubtedly one of the educator, and an advocate of early Independence for India. Tagorewon the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. Two years later he was awarded the knight hood, but he surrendered it in 1919 as a poets reaction against the massacre of Amritsar, where the British troops killed over 400 Indian demonstrators. Tagore's influence on Gandhi and the founders of modern India was enormous, but his reputation in the west as a mystic has perhaps mislead his Western readers to ignore his role as reform and critic of colonialism \\\"When one knows thee, then alien there is none then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose touch of the one in the play of the many\\\" Gitanjali. RabindranathTagorewas born in Calcutta into a wealthy and prominent family. His father was Maharishi Rabindranath Tagore, a religious reformer and scholar. His mother, Sarada Devi, died when Tagore was very young. Tagore's grandfather had established a huge financial empire for himself. His philanthropy led him to help a number of public projects, such as Calcutta Medical college. Rabindranath Tagore, who died in 1941 at the age of eighty, is a towering figure in the millennium- old literature of Bengal. Anyone who becomes familiar with this large and flourishing tradition will be impressed by the power of Tagore's presence in Bangladesh and in India. His poetry as well as his novels, short stories, and essaysare very widely read, and the songshe composed reverberate around the eastern past of India and throughout Bangladesh. Tagore tried to combine traditional Indian culture and Western ideas. In \\\"My Reminiscences\\\" Tagore mentions that it was not until the age of 10 that he started to use socks and shoes. And servants beat the children regularly. Tagore, the youngest, started to compose poems at the age of eight. Tagore's first book, a collection of poems, appeared when he was 17; Tagor's friend who wanted to surprise him published it. Tagore received his early education first from tutors and then at a variety of schools.Among them were Bengalacademy where he studied history and culture. At University College, London, he studied Law but\n\nleft after a year as he did not like the weather. In England Tagore started to compose the poem 'Bhagna Hridaj' In 1883 Tagore married Mrinalini Devi Raichandhuri, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. Between 1893 and 1900 he wrote seven volumes of poetry, including SONARTARI (The golden Boat), 1894and KHANIKA,1990. this was highly productive - period in Tagore's life. More important was that Tagore wrote in the common language of the people. Tagorewas the first Indian to bring an element of psychologicaldualism to his novels. Between 1891 and 1895 he published forty four short stories in Bengali periodicals, most of them in the monthly journal Sadhana, Tagore's short stories became famous. In 1901 Tagore founded a school outside Calcutta, Visva-Bharathi; which was dedicated to emerging western and Indian philosophy and education. He produced poems, novels, stories, a text on the history of India, text Books and treatises on pedagogy. Tagor's wife died in 1902, next year one of his daughters died, and in 1907Tagore lost his yosnger son. Tagore's reputation as a writer was established in United States and in England, after the publication of GITANJALI: SONG OFFERINGSa, bout divine and human love. Tagorewrote his most important works in Bengali, but they were often translated into English. At the age of 70 Tagore took up painting. He was also a composer, setting hundreds of poems to music. Many of his poems are actually songs, and in seperable from their music. Tagore's 'Our golden Bengal' became the national anthem of Bangladesh.Only hours before he died on August 7, in 1941, Tagore dictated his last poem. His written production, still not completely collected, fills nearly 30 substantial volumes.\n\nJAWAHARIAL NBHRU Jawaharlal Nehru was a major political leader and pivotal figure in the Congress Party, and the first and longest-serving prime minister of independent India, serving from 1947 to 1964_As one of the founders of the Non-aligned Movement, he was an important figure in the international politics of the post-war era.

Rising to Congress President under the mentorship of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru was a charismatic, radical leader, advocating complete independence from the British Empire, and was eventually recognised as Gandhi's political heir. A life-long liberal, Nehru was also an advocate for Fabian socialism and the public sector as the means by which long-standing challenges of economic development could be addressed. Nehru raised the flag of independent India in New Delhi on 15 August 1947, and served as Prime Minister. Nehru's appreciation for parliamentary democracy coupled with concerns for the poor and underprivileged enabled him to formulate policies that often reflected his socialist leanings. Both as prime minister and as Congresspresident, Nehru pushed through the Indian Parliament, dominated by members of his own party, a series of legal reforms intended to emancipate Hindu women and bring equality. These reforms included raising the minimum marriageable age from twelve to fifteen, empowering women to divorce their husbands and inherit property, and declaring illegal the ruinous dowry system.

Burman and nicknamed Pancham da, was one of the greatest music composers of Bollywood. He was the only son of singer and Bollywood music composer Sachin Dev Burman and his wife Meera. He is credited with revolutionizing the music in Hindi films, and his style and techniques continue to be followed by the composers of today. Rahul Dev Burman was born in Calcutta. After coming to Mumbai, he learnt Sarod from Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. When he was nine years old, he composed his first song, Aye meri topi palat ke aa, which his father used in the film Funtoosh (1956). The tune of the song Sar jo tera chakraaye was composed by him as a child. His father loved the tune and included it in the soundtrack of Guru Dutt's Pyaasa. As a child, Pancham also played the mouth organ in the famous song Hai apna dil to aawara (from film Solva Saal - 1958, starring Dev Anand). Pancham began his music career as an assistant to his father. His first film as a music director was Chhote nawaab. Music career He started independent music composing before long. Out of his 331 released movies, 292 were in Hindi, 31 in Bangla, 3 in Telugu, 2 each in Tamil & Oriya and 1 in Marathi. RD also composed for 5 TV Serials in Hindi and Marathi. He also scored a large number of non-film songs in Bangla, which are available in different albums. He did a song for a small documentary film called Maa Ki Pukaar too, in 1975. R D Burman did playback in eighteen movies composed by him. He was famous for unique, grunting bass singing style. He also acted in the film Bhoot Bungla (1965) and Pyar Ka Mausam (1967). He also used some of the popular western songs to compose his own tunes. His one of the super hit song \\\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\\\" is inspired from the song \\\"Say You Love Me\\\" by the Greek singer Demis Roussos. After his death, in the late 1990s, the remix versions of R D Burman's hits conti me rule the to Indian music scene. Even today, most of the Indian remix songs are his tunes remixed. Jhankaar Beats (2003 movie)starring Sanjay Suri, Rahul Bose, Juhi\n\nChawla & Rinkie Khanna was sort of a tribute to ROB, wherein Sur & Bose play musicians who revere ROB and his music and whose music is influenced by Burman. There was a remixed version of Burmans popular Kishore Kumar number \\\"Humein tumse pyaar kitna\\\" which was integral to the film. Foreign collaborations and private albums In a rare feat, noted lyricist, Gulzar, R.D. Burman and Asha Bhosle, came together in 1987, to create a double album, titled, Oil Padosi Hai, which was released on September 8, 1987, Asha Bhosle' birthday. R 0 Burman also produced private albums, including one based on the samba, and also collaborated with Boy George. He has also composed music for an album called Pantera produced by Pete Gavankar in 1987 whose lyrics were written by Jose Flores. Music style Pancham was comfortable with all types of music, be it the romantic Raat kali from Buddha mil gaya (1971), the sexy cabaret Piya tu ab to aaja from Caravan (1971), the ultimate hippie anthem \\\"Dum Maro Dum\\\" from Hare Krishna Hare Rama (1972) or the classical Raina beeti jaaye. It is said that Dev Anand did not include the complete version of Dum Maro Dum in Hare Rama Hare Krishna, as he was worried the song would overshadow the film. At times, R 0 doubled up as a singer too. His most famous song as a singer was \\\"Mehbooba\\\" from Sholay. This song is inspired from the song \\\"Say You Love Me\\\" by Demis Roussos. Pancham was a very creative person. His percussion included a spoon against a glass (Chura liya hai from Yaadon Ki baraat), desks (Masterji ki aa gayee chitthee from Kitaab) a bamboo whistle with a balloon (Abdullah) and bottles filled with water at different levels (0 maajhi re from Khushboo). Some of Pancham's songs were inspired from popular western tunes. For example,Aao twist karein (Bhoot Bangla) was a direct lift of Come lets twist again by Chubby Checker while Tera mujhse hai pehle ka naata koi (Aaa Gale Lag Ja) is said to be a copy of The Yellow Rose of Texas by Elvis Presley. There are many such other examples available at itwofs. \\\"Bhali Bhali 5i Ek Surat\\\" (from Buddha Mil Gaya) is inspired by \\\"Jump in the Line\\\" (by Harry Belafonte). Another example is Mamma\n\nMia by ABBA which inspired 'tere liye zamana tere liye' in Hum Kisi Se Kam Nahi Pancham also adapted folk music from eastern Europe in some of his tunes, such as the songs in the movie Satte Pe Satta. There have been discussions regarding the influence of the communist block of the eastern Europe on Pancham's music. Pancham has also directed music for some regional films, including Bangla, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu and Marathi. He also acted in one of the Bengali film named Gayak (starring Amitkumar and Debasri Roy), where RD plays himself and 'discovers' Amit singing on a beach. Pancham's non-filmi music comprises few albums, including Pantera - the international album for which he shares credit with Latin American composer Jose Flores. In the only experiment of its kind he recorded the light version of \\\"Hume tumse pyar kitana\\\" in the voice of playback singer kishorekumar while the classical version in the voice of \\\"Parvenn sultana\\\". RAJNlKANT Shivaji Rao Gaekwad (Rajnikanth) was born on December 12, 1949 in Bangalore (India) he was the son of a police constable. He was a bus conductor during which time he reportedly caught the fancy of the bus travellers with his mannerisms and style of issuing tickets and blowing the whistle and so on. Wanting to become an actor, he moved to Chennai and joined the film institute. It was here that he caught the eye of K. Balachander, a director known for introducing talented, new faces into the Tamil film industry. Balachander gave him a small role - as the no- good husband of Srividya - in Aboorva Raagangal and the rest, as they say, is history. Rajnikanth soon graduated to playing villains and his style, swagger and casually unique brand of villainy draw the movie-\n\ngoing public. Be it the sadistic husband of Sujatha in Avargal or the wolf in sheep's clothing in Moondru Mudichu or the lust· filled village rowdy in Bharathiraja's 16 Vayadhinile, Rajnikanth was the villain the people loved to hate. From here, it was a small step for Rajni, playing the anti-hero and finally, the hero in Bhairavi. Rajnikanth firmly captured the vacant, action-hero slot in Tamil movies with a series of movies where he routinely bashed up the bad guyswho had done him injustice in one way or the other. Once in a while he did movies like Aarulirundhu Arubadhu Varai or Johny which gave us glimpses of his acting potential. But action was what the fans expected from a Rajni movie and action was what he gave them. He has been superstar for the past 25 years. The Tamil megastar of the 80s and 90s he was one of the highest earning actors at his peak. He has also worked in Hindi, Telugu and Kannadaand even a English film. He made his debut in Katha Sangama (1975) and became a star with Apoorva Raagangal (1975). His unique acting style is characterised by a trademark gesture: flipping a cigarette in the air and catching it in his mouth. His dark skin and heavy-lidded eyes have made him the hero of the lower classes. His fans conduct poojas on huge cutouts of Rajnikant just before the launching of his films to ensure his success. His fans collect opening day ticket of his movies and even buy them at exhorbitant prices. Directors cannot 'kill off' his character in the movie for fear that the theatre will be burnt down to prevent future runnings of the movie by his 'crazed' fans who consider him almost a God. He is said to \\\"explode like a tiger on screen\\\". As the tradition of films and politics continues in Tamil Nadu, his immense popularity on screen has opened the doors of a political career.\n\nRATANTATA Mr Tata holds a B.Se.

He holds several batting records, including the most Test centuries and the most one-day international centuries, and was rated in 2002 by Wisden as the second greatest Test batsman ever, after Sir Don Bradman. He received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, India's highest sporting honour, for 1997- 1998, and the civilian award Padma Shri in 1999. Tendulkar was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1997. EARLY DAYS Born in Mumbai (then Bombay) into a middle-class family, Sachin Tendulkar was named after his family's favourite music director Sachin Dev Burman. He went to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School where he started his cricketing career under coach Ramakant Achrekar. While at school, he was involved in a mammoth 664 run partnership in a Harris Shield game with friend and team mate Vinod Kambli. In 1988/1989, he scored 100 not-out in his first first-class match, for Bombay against Gujarat. DOMESTIC CAREER On December 11, 1988, aged just 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar scored 100 not-out in his debut first-class match for Mumbai against Gujarat, making him the youngest cricketer to score a century. His first double century was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998. Tendulkar is the only player to score a century in all three of his Ranji Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Irani Trophy debuts. In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas born player to represent Yorkshire (Craig White, although borne in Yorkshire was the first player to be signed as an overseas player by Yorkshire. He had to be listed as an overseas player as he had already played for Victoria in Australia). Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52\n\nINDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008. As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15%more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya. INTERNATIONAL CAREER Sachin played his first international match against Pakistan in Karachi in 1989, facing the likes of Wasim Akram, Imran Khan, Abdul Qadir, and Waqar Younis. He made just 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match. It was an inauspicious start, but Tendulkar followed it up with his maiden test fifty a few days later at Faisalabad. His One-day International (ODI) debut on December18wasequally disappointing, where he was dismissedwithout scoring a run, again by Waqar Younis. The series was followed by a non-descript tour of New Zealand in which he fell for 88 in a test match, John Wright, who would later coach India, pouching the catch that prevented Tendulkar from becoming the youngest centurion in Test cricket. The long anticipated maiden Test century came in England's tour in 1990 but the other scores were not remarkable. Tendulkar truly came into his own in the 1991-1992 tour of Australia that included a brilliant century on the fast and bouncy track at Perth. He has been Man of the Match 11 times in Test matches and Man of the Series twice, both times in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. His first ODIcentury came on September 9, 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo. It had taken Tendulkar 79 ODls to score a century. SachinTendulkar is the only player to score a century while making his Ranji Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Irani Trophy debut. Wisden named Tendulkar one of the Cricketers of the Year in 1997, the first calendar year in which he scored 1,000 Test runs. He repeated the feat in 1999, 2001, and 2002. Tendulkar also holds the record for scoring 1,000 ODIruns in a calendar year. He has done it six times - 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2003. In 1998 he made 1,894 ODI runs, still the record for ODI runs\n\nby any batsman in any given calendar year. INDIVIDUALHONOURS Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, 2008.

Fan following SachinTendulkar's entry into world cricket was very much hyped up by former Indian stars and those who had seen him play. By scoring his first half-century in his second match and his first century aged 17, Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries. One of the most popular sayings by Sachin's fans is \\\"Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God\\\". At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following is so great that he is unable to lead a normal life. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to \\\"wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night\\\". In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.\n\nSAlYAJIT RAY Satyajit Ray, an Indian filmmaker and among the dozen or so great masters of world cinema, is known for his humanistic approach to cinema. He made his films in Bengali, a language spoken in the eastern state of India - West Bengal. And yet, his films are of universal interest. They are about things that make up the human race - relationships, emotions, struggle, conflicts, joys and sorrows. Satyajit Ray,the master storyteller, has left a cinematic heritage that belongs as much to India as to the world. His films demonstrate a remarkable humanism, elaborate observation and subtle handling of characters and situations. The cinema of Satyajit Ray is a rare blend of intellect and emotions. He is controlled, precise, meticulous, and yet, evokes deep emotional response from the audience. His films depict a fine sensitivity without using melodrama or dramatic excesses. He evolved a cinematic style that is almost invisible. He strongly believed - \\\"The best technique is the one that's not noticeable\\\". Though initially inspired by the neo-realist tradition, his cinema belongs not to a specific category or style but a timeless meta-genre of a style of story telling that touches the audience in some way. His films belong to a meta-genre that includes the works of Akira Kurosawa, Alfred Hitchcock, Charles Chaplin, David Lean, Federico Fellini, Fritz Lang, John Ford, Ingmar Bergman, Jean Renoir, Luis Bunuel, Yasujiro Ozu, Ritwik Ghatak and Robert Bresson.All very different in style and content, and yet creators of cinema that is timeless and universal. Awards In 1978, the organizing committee of the Berlin Film Festival ranked him as one of the three all-time best directors. In 1992, Satyajit Ray received the honorary Academy Award - Lifetime Achievement - \\\"In recognition of his rare mastery of the art of motion pictures and for his profound humanitarian outlook, which has had an indelible influence on filmmakers and audiences throughout the world.\\\" Other honors include \\\"Legion d'Honneur\\\", France and \\\"Bharatratna\\\" (Jewel of India).\n\nSDBURMAN The famous music director S.D.Burman was born in Tripura. He was in classical music by his father, sitarist and dhrupad singer Nabadwipchandra Dev Burman; later he trained uner Ustad Badal Khan and Bhishmadev Chattopadhyay. His early works for the radio were based on east Bengali and north-eastern folk music. In early 1930s, S.D.Burman made a reputation for himself in bengal as singer of folk and light classical music, for example at the Allahabad Sangeet Sammelan (Music Conference) in 1935. His first record was of a Nazrul Islam composition and leading to a long and productive releationship with the writer/composer. The made his debut in films singing for Pankaj Mullick in Atorthy's Yahudi Ki Ladki (1933) but the songs were scrapped and re-sung by Pahadi Sanyat. So his first film as singer was Tinkari Chakraborthy's Sanjher Pidim (1935); he also acted in Dhiren Ganguli's Bidrohi (1935). He was Music director from 1939onwards in Calcutta. The moved to Bombayin 1944 and worked at Filmistan (Eight Days, Shabnam), Navketan (Afsar, Taxi Driver, Funtoosh, Guide) and for Guru Dutt tBaazi, Jaal, Pyaasa, Kagaz ke Phool). The remained Dev Anand's key composer for several years (Paying Guest, Tere Ghar ke Saamne, Jewel Thief, Prem Pujari). He also worked on films for Bimal Roy (Devdas, Sujata, Bandini). S.D.Burman's compositions often influenced by his huge repertory of folk-tunes from the Bengali Bhatiali, Sari and Dhamail traditions of the North East. As a singer, his thin but powerful, accented voice was often used as a bardic commentary: for example the Wahan kaun hai tera musafir in Guide, Safal hogi teri aradhana in the hit Rajesh Khanna movie Aradhana. He also wrote an autobiography: Sargamer Nikhad.\n\nSHA8ANAAZMI Besides being an intense actress, she is also a social and political activist. She is a feminist who has fought for women's causes and for slum dwellers. These activities may have led to many controversies, but she knows what is right and what she is doing. She is a self-made person. Shabana Azmi was born to eminent parents in 1953. She is the daughter of communist Urdu poet and lyricist Kaifi Azmi and actress Shaukat Azmi. She comes from a family of talented people and has immense talent in every drop of her blood. This talent was at first exploited by noted filmmaker Khwaja Ahmed Abbas in Faasle. But as her debut film was consuming a lot of time, she was allowed to do other films as well. This enabled her to do films with other great directors like in Shyam Benegal's Ankur. She was so appreciated that she became a regular in his other films like Nishaant, Junoon, Mandi and Susman. Shabana also had the opportunity of working with satyajit Ray in films like Shatranj Ke Khiladi. She was such a good actress that all the top art directors wanted her in their films. So Shabana continued doing films like Khandhar with Mrinal Sen, Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyu Aata Hain with Saeed Mirza, Paar with Gautam Ghosh, Sparsh and Disha with Sai Paranjpe, Sati with Aparna Sen and Arth with Mahesh Bhatt. But it would be wrong to say that she only concentrated in art cinema. She has also had a few good commercial movies like Amar Akbar Anthony, Lahoo Ke Do Rans, Parvarish, Fakira and Jwalamukhi mostly with Vinod Khanna. Her heart though remained in doing more of art films. Married to noted storywriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar, she continues appearing on the silver screen. Of late, she has done a few chosen movies like Fire which brought a lot of controversy because of traces of lesbianism in it. Then it was Godmother which was felt to be inspired from a real life story. This film took a lot of time to get released but once released, it won a whole lot of awards and critical acclaim. Yet another film of hers which saw the light of controversy was Deepa Mehta's Water. Though she shaved off her head for this film, it finally had to be shelved because of staunch followers of Hinduism. Controversy and Shabana seem to be running parallel to each other. Namrata M Shah\n\nSIR CHANDRASEKHAR VENKATA RAMAN The Indian physicist Sir Chandrasekhar Venkata Raman (1888-1970) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light and his discovery of the Raman effect, which has to do with changes in the wavelength of light scattered by molecules. C. V. Raman was born on November 7, 1888 at Trichinopoly, Madras, where his father taught physics in a church college. A few years later the family moved to Vizagapatam when the father was appointed as lecturer in the local college. Raman received his early education there until he entered Presidency College in Madras in 1902. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1904, standing first in his class and winning the gold medal in physics. By the time he completed his master's degree in physics in 1907, he had already done original work in optics and acoustics, but since at that time there was little scope for scientific research in India, he took the competitive examination for a post in the Finance Department of the Government of India. Again he won first place and as a result was appointed Assistant Accountant General in the central government offices in Calcutta. During the next 10 years, while working in the Finance Department, Raman continued his scientific researches on his own in the laboratory of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science. The importance of his work was recognized by his appointment in 1917 to the first endowed chair in physics at Calcutta University. He kept this post until 1933. Raman's years at Calcutta University were marked by great creativity and intellectual excitement, although by western standards his laboratory facilities were meager. Many honors came to him as the significance of his work was acknowledged in India and abroad, as in 1929, when he was invited to do research at the California Institute of Technology. The most tangible evidence of this recognition came in 1927, when the British government conferred a knighthood on him, and in 1930, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize. The Raman Effect Raman's early scientific interests were centered on phenomena associated with the sca ttering of light, the most familiar example of which is the effect created when light enters a darkened room through\n\na small hole. The beam of light is then clearly seen because the light is scattered by the particles of dust in the air. That scattered light contained wavelengths in different proportions from the wavelengths of the main beam of light had been known since Tyndall's experiments in 1868, but a fully satisfactory analysis of the phenomenon had not been made. It was this and related problems that Ramanwas studying at Calcutta when he discovered that when an intense light was passedthrough a liquid and was scattered by the molecules in the liquid, the spectrum of the scattered light showed lines not in the spectrum of the incident light. This discovery was the Raman effect, which had such great influence on later work on molecular structure and radiation that Raman was recognized as one of the truly seminal minds in the history of modern physics. After Raman retired from Calcutta University, he became director of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, where he remained until 1948, when he became head of the new Raman Research Institute in the same city. Here he continued to guide research and to inspire his students and coworkers. They spoke of his intense enthusiasm and volcanic energy and of his great generosity in acknowledging the contribution of others. According to one former student, he would \\\"give away whole lines of research which lesser men would be tempted to keep for themselves.\\\" Raman's attractiveness as a person was rooted in his aesthetic approach to science, with his choice of subjects for investigation reflecting his love of music, color, harmony, and pattern. He told how his great discovery of the Raman effect was stimulated during a voyageto Europein 1921, when he saw for the first time \\\"the wonderful blue opalescence of the Mediterranean Sea\\\" and began to think that the phenomenonwas due to the scattering of sunlight by the molecules of water. Raman influenced Indian scientific development through the Indian Journal of Physics,which he helped found and which he edited. He was also a gifted popularizer of modern scientific ideas, and he lectured widely to lay audiences. He died in Bangalore on Nov. 21, 1970.\n\nVIKKU VINAYAKARAM Thetakudi Harihara Vinayakaram, known to the musical community and to the world as \\\"Vikku\\\" is known for his immense talent and imaginative playing of the ghatam - an instrument vital to Carnatic music concerts. Son of the famous Kalaimani T.R. Harihara Sharma, who had himself played the mridangam, marsing, and gattuvadhyam, Vinayakarambegan his career at the tender age of thirteen, and made an impression on the musicians of the time as a child prodigy. Soon, he began to accompany singers like M.S. Subbulakshmi and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and G.N Balasubramaniam. \\\"Vikku\\\" Vinayakaram shot into fame when he began to play for the international musical troupe, Shakti in 1970, along with John Mac Laughlin and Zakir Hussain and at this point, first tasted international fame. \\\"Vikku\\\" with his long hair, and nimble fingers, not to mention his innovative ways of playing the traditional ghatam for a diverse international audience soon captivated large numbers of music lovers all over the world and the ghatam, in his able hands, shot into fame. The ghatam, literally meaning \\\"pot\\\" is simply a mud pot that is played by pressing the narrow mouth over the abdomen and tapping on the curvature of the pot with the fingers, at different spots, to produce soundsof different tones. In Vikku's hands, the Ghatam became, not simply a stationary instrument but a dynamic one as he was known for throwing the ghatam up in the air during his tani avartanam (solo performance, usually the finale of a concert), and catching it without missing a beat. Vinayakram has a number of titles and awards to his name, including: Astana Vidhwan of Kanchi Kama Kati Peetam, \\\"Ghatam Nagamani\\\" given by Sri Sri Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, \\\"Kalaimamini\\\" given by the Governmentof Tamil Nadu, India, and the first SangeethNatakAcademy Award for Ghatam in 1988. In addition to these attainments, Vinayakram became the first South Indian artist to ever receive a Grammy Award in 1991 for Best World Music Album for his participation in Mickey Hart's \\\"Planet Drum\\\" in which he played ghatam and marsingh. It is noteworthy that Vinayakram donated all of the royalties he received from this Grammy Award to\n\nKanchi Kama Koti Peetam : In addition, Vinayakram was a nominee for the 38th Annual Grammy Awards for Best World Music Album for his participation in 'Raga Aberi' along with L. Shankar on the ten string double violin and Zakir Hussain on the tabla (the piece on this album is a ragam-tanam-pallavi in raga aberi set in a tala cycle of 4 3/4 beats). Vinayakram is also noted for his accompaniment in the first Carnatic concert given at the United Nations in New York by M. S. Subbulakshmi in 1966. Cu rrently, T.H. Vinayakram is the principal of his Sri Jaya Ganesha Thala Yadya Vidyalaya Percussion School in Madras. Sneha Krishnan 06/HS/42 VIJAYALAKSHMI PANDIT She was born on August 18, 1900 as Swarup Kumari Nehru at Allahabad. The elder daughter of Shri Motilal Nehru and Swarup Rani. At the time when Vijayalakshmi came into this world Jawaharlal, her elder brother, was about 11 years old. He had long nourished a secret grievance at not having any brothers or sisters when everybody else seemed to have them, and the prospect of having at least a baby brother or sister all to himself was exhilarating. She was born not with silver but a diamond spoon in her mouth as her father had earned distinction, name and wealth, and the costliest luxuries of life by the time she was born. At a very early age, when she was just four or five years old, she accompanied her father and mother on a tour to Europe. It was then that her father appointed a European governess named Miss Hooper, who was known to be a very fine governess with extremely good qualifications. She came from a very good family.\n\nVijayalakshmi was taught to be very regular and punctual in her childhood days in the company of Miss Hooper. Lessons, play and other activities went on with strict regularity under the careful supervision of the governess and teachers in the spacious and beautiful gardens of their magnificent residence. As her father had become a great political leader, their family home at Allahabad, Anand Bhavan, became the venue of the meetings for the eminent personalities of India. In 1915 she accompanied her father to the annual session of the Indian National Congress at Bombay (now Mumbai). In 1919 the tragedy of Jallianwala Bagh occurred. The same year the Nehru family came in contact with Mahatma Gandhi. It was beginning of the 'conversion' of the Nehru family and as such, of the 'conversion' of Vijayalakshmi too. Ranjit Pandit, when she was about 21 years old, Vijaya fell in love with a cultured literature, aristocrat, and barrister from Kathiawar. Vijaya and Ranjit married on May 10, 1921. The birth of three children - Chandra Lekha, Nayantara and Rita Vitasta added to the fulfillment of her life. But for the untimely death of her husband and other occasional disruptions., which the family had to bear for the cause of the country, theirs was a happy, integrated family. Pandit Motilal Nehru used to tell his daughters that patriotism was in their blood. In December 1931, when Gandhiji returned from England after having attended the Round Table Conference, the most tumultuous scenes in the history of I ndian political struggle were witnessed - the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1932 started. Vijayalakshmi responded to the call of the hour. She joined the ranks of surging millions in demonstrating to the Government the resentment of the Indian people against foreign rule. She delivered speeches, led processions and organised harta/s (strikes) at different places. As a result a notice was served on her prohibiting her from taking part in such movements for a period of one month. She did not abide by the government order and was arrested on January 27, 1932, along with her sister, Krishna. Thus, all members of the Nehru family were in jail, except their frail mother.\n\nVijayalakshmi was tried and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment with fine. During that year she was kept in Lucknow Jail. Her youngest child at the time was only 2 1/2 years old. In 1935she contested for the Municipal Board membership in Allahabad and was elected with an overwhelming support of votes. Her period of stay in the Board was, however, uneventful. During that period she was also elected as the Chairperson of the Education Committee of the Board. In that capacity she worked for about 18 months and gathered considerable experience of the civic and educational life of the people around. Then came the General Elections of the year 1937. She stood as a candidate for the Provincial Assembly of the United Provinces from Cawnpore (Kanpur) Bilhaur constituency, opposing Lady Srivastava, the wife of the then Minister of Education in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh)Government. Shewon convincingly. On Thursday, the July 29, 1937 at 11 a.rn., the United Provinces Assembly met at the Assembly Hall, where Vijayalakshmi took her oath as the Minister of Local Self Government. She became the head of the Local Self- Government department, covering health and sanitation. When Vijayalakshmi Pandit took charge of the department, she had several problems to tackle and many obstacles to overcome. At many places, especially in some rural areas, drinking water facilities did not exist. and people were hard-pressed for pure drinking water. Maternity and child welfare facilities from the Government side were almost non- existent. With the start of the Second World War in 1939, the CongressMinistry resigned. Gandhiji gave the slogan of \\\"Do or Die\\\" to the masses of India, and to the British, \\\"Quit India\\\". Vijayalakshmi Pandit with other soldiers of freedom took to her duty and played her role in the struggle for freedom of the motherland. In the face of indiscriminate firing, she rushed to crowds, helped the wounded and arranged to carry them to hospitals. She was arrested on August, 12, 1942 and was lodged in Naini Jail. After about nine months imprisonment she was released on June 11, 1943 on grounds of ill-health. In spite of her weak health, however, immediately after release from Naini Jail, she took up the famine relief work, became president of the \\\"Save the Children\\\" Fund Committee started by the All-India Women's Conference, and devoted\n\nherself whole-heartedly to other public welfare activities. After Independence, Vijayalakshmi Pandit became free India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union. She had a distinguished innings in the field of foreign affairs. She headed the country's delegation to the United Nations during 1947-49. When she returned to India in 1952, she contested the first general elections in independent India and won a Lok Sabha seat. It was the year 1953 which saw her at the peak of her popularity as the first woman elected president of the UN General Assembly where she spoke against apartheid and in favour of world peace. Her differences with Mrs. Indira Gandhi came to the fore during 1975- 77. She opposed the imposition of Emergency tooth and nail. She decided to retreat to Dehradun. She came out of her self-imposed exile when she campaigned actively for the Janata Party in 1977. The fall of the Janata Party left her a sad and bitter person. Her health took a turn for the worse when she suffered a stroke. She made a quick recovery, and returned to Dehradun. Her 90th birthday on August 18, 1990 was celebrated as a major event, with many members of the Nehru clan taking time off to spend the day with her. Arun Nehru, Maneka Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were all there to make it a special family affair. She died on December 1, 1990. ZUBINMEHTA Zubin Mehta was born in 1936 in Bombay and received his first musical education from his father Mehli Mehta, the founder of the Bombay Symphony Orchestra. After a short period of pre-medica' studies in Bombay, he left for Vienna in 1954 where he eventually entered the conducting programme under Hans Swarowsky at the Akademie fur Musik. Zubin Mehta won the Liverpool International Conducting Competition in 1958 and was also a prize-winner of the summer academy at Tanglewood, By 1961 he had already conducted the Vienna, Berlin and Israel Philharmonic Orchestras and still retains close ties with these orchestras.\n\nZubin Mehta was Music Director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra from 1961 to 1967. He also became Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmnnic Orchestra in 1962, a post he retained until 1978. In 1969 he also became Music Adviser to the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and was made Music Director of that orchestra in 1977. In 1981 he was made Music Director for life. Zubin Mehta has conducted over two thousand concerts with this extraordinary ensemble including tours spanning five continents. In 1978 he became Music Director of the New York Philharmonic, commencing a tenure lasting 13 years, the longest in the orchestra's history. Since 1985, he has been chief conductor of the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence. Zubin Mehta made his debut as an opera conductor with Tasca in Montreal in 1963. Since then he has conducted at the Metropolitan Opera New York, the Vienna State Opera, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, La Scala Milan, and the opera houses of Chicago and Florence as well as at the Salzburg Festival.

In October 2008 Zubin Mehta was be honoured by the Japanese Imperial Family with the \\\"Praemium Imperiale\\\".\n\nEARTH'S OWN - MEDHA PATKAK When Indian environmentalism is spoken about the one name that stands out is that of Medha Patkar, a fearless social leader whose courage and conviction has been inspirational. She was born on 1st December 1954 and was raised by politically and socially active parents. While her fa- ther was a freedom fighter, her mother was a member of the Swadar, an organization that helped women who were in difficult circumstances. After obtaining a masters degree in social work from the Tata Institute of Social Studies. She worked for seven years with various voluntary organizations in Bombay and Gujarat. She later became a faculty at TISSand worked towards PhD. She remained at TISS for three years and left her PhD in midst to get totally involved in agitations begun by the tribes of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, which eventually paved the way for the formation of the Narmada BachaoAndolan(NBA). The Narmada BachaoAndolan, which was founded by Madha Patkar, has a mass base of tribal and peasant communities. In the name of progress and development it has always been the rights of the illiterate and poor tribes that have been exploited. Dams in India have always been in the eye of the storm and the cause for creating millions of eco refugees. Evicting marginalized people was never a heart burner for successive governments but in the case of the Sardar Sarover dam with Medha Patkar being around to thwart their plans, the situation turned ugly. Medha Patkar has always held that raising the height of the dam would benefit only the wealthy landowners of Gujarat and not the poor water starved farmers of Kutch as the prodam -activists have claimed. The Supreme court verdict favour of raising the height only vindicates the fact that money still talks. The NBA is essentially an NGO that mobilized, tribals, adivasis, farmers, environmental and human rights activists against the Sardar Sarovar Dam. It originally focused on environmental issues related to trees that would be submerged under the dam and later refocused on enabling poor citizens, especially the oustees, to get full rehabilitation facilities from the government. Medha Patkar along with Baba Amte was also a prime mover in the National Alliance of People's movement-an alliance opposed to policies based on globalization. Medha was also part of the agitations in Singur, West Bengal. She also served as commissioner to the World Commission on Dams.\n\nMedha Patkar has been universally applauded for her role in protecting the environment and for taking up the cause of the unnamed, unwanted and unimportant Indian. She received the Right livelihood Award in 1991, The MA Thomas National human Rights Award in 1999, Deena Nath Mangeshkar Award, Mahatma Phule Award, Goldman Environmental Prize, Green Ribbon. Best International Political Campaigner, BBC, Human Rights Defenders Award by the Amnesty International. Dolly Thomas Faculty Dept. of History LALGUDI G. JAYARAMAN The world of music has produced several stalwarts and one among them is Sri Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, a well-known Carnatic Violinist. He was born on September 17th 1930. His father was Sri Gopala Iyer, who was his Guru as well. He started his music career as an accompanying violinist at the age of 12. He rose to eminence very rapidly due to his quick grasp, rich imagination and adaptabil ity to individual styles of leading maestros in Carnatic music. He revolutionized Indian classical music by establishing a unique style that came to be known as 'Lalgudi bani'. He has accom- panied several vocal maestros on the violin like Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, G.N. Balasubramanian, M. Balamuralikrishna, Maharajapuram Santhanarn, T.N. Seshagopalan and many others. Apart from this he was the first to bring internati anal attention to the violin in Carnatic style and produced a music ensemble with the violin, flute and veena in 1966. He has represented the country in a number of concerts abroad. The Government of India sent him to Russia as a member of the Indian Cultural Delegation and to the Festival of India in the USA, London, Germany, and Italy. He gave both solo and Jugalbandhi concerts. Sri Lalgudi has traveled to Singapore, Malaysia, Manila and East European countries. In 1984 he toured the west Asian countries like Oman, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain. Impressed by Lalgudi's technique, Yehudi Menuhin the renowned violinist, presented him with his violin at the Edinburgh festival in 1965. Sri Lalgudi's achievement include compositions of several 'kritis',"
