This may be the incident of about more than thirty years old. Owner of the house gave us ultimate to vacate the house by so and so date as he wanted to sell it. My father tried but couldn't get any suitable house on rent. The matter reached to the court. With some influence, the owner of the house got the court order. The court had given some deadline to vacate the house. Only a few days were left for the deadline to vacate the house. My mother was too much worried. It was the court order, if the house could not be vacated, it was to be vacated through Police force on that date. The owner was too much happy. It seems that he spent much amount of money at lower level to get this order passed. My mother was too much worried. She used to worship Lord Shiva. She went to the temple for prayer. Lord Shiva listened her prayer and gave her thought to visit one of our family friends. He was a Judge but in some lower court. We were not knowing that he was dealing such cases. My mother told the entire incident to him. After knowing it, he told my mother that he only passed that order. Why we didn't inform him earlier? He told my Mom - No problem. You need not vacate the house till you want. We got too much relief. The decision to vacate the house was stayed till further notice. My Mother thanked Lord Shiva for showing His grace!\n\n1185/ 1 Mar 2022 Om Namah Shivaya Mantra Meaning *Om Namah Shivaya is a powerful and popular Mantra of Lord Shiva. But do you know its meaning? *Shiva means Kalyankari in Hindi. Kalyankari means one who does good of every one! Hence meaning of this Mantra. We worship one who always does good of others! *But, what is real good? Real good is one which is done selflessly! If we always do good of every one selflessly ie without any intention or motive of our gain, then we are in Shiva! *But we can make one intention, one motive! We can see Shiva inside every one! Shiva means Shiv-Tatva which includes every God like Jesus, Allah, Nanak etc! You can name it Almighty! *Then we really love Lord Shiva! Then we really chant this auspicious and powerful Mantra! *Wishing You Happy Maha Shivratri! *Om Namah Shivaya ‡•ê ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø\n\n1431/ 5 December 2022 True Incident : When I came to know the Truth of these sacred words of Lord Shiva Lord Shiva has told in Ramayana: Uma Kahau Mein Anubhav Apna..... I am blessed to realize these sacred words of Lord Shiva! I was enlightened during the year 1990 with the infinite grace and blessing of Lord Sri Krishna! It is truly mentioned in Bhagavad Gita. I also had the same experience:- One can't see Almighty with the normal eyes. Hence I was blessed with Divya Dristhi, the divine eyes. After that I was enlightened. I felt that I was sleeping since millions of years. I experienced that I woke up all of the sudden after seeing a long dream of thousands of births. I lost my all individuality and personality. I felt that I have been blessed with a new birth.\n\n1515/ 28 DEC 2022 Those people are wise *Who can reply these questions! Those people are wise! *Who contemplate on these questions!
