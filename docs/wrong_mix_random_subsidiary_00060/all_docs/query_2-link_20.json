        "text": "Indian classical music legend Shiv Kumar Sharma has died at the age of 84.\n\nSharma was an exponent of santoor, a dulcimer-like instrument. He suffered a heart attack at his residence in Mumbai on Tuesday morning.\n\nSharma is credited with converting the santoor, which was mainly played in Kashmir, into a major instrument of Indian classical music.\n\nSharma was also part of a duo - along with flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia - who worked on classical and film music.\n\nShiv-Hari, as they were called, composed music for at least eight Bollywood films, including Silsila, Chandni, Darr and Lamhe.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes to Sharma.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nSharma was born and raised in Jammu in a house by a river where, in his words, \"from dawn till dusk, someone or the other was singing or playing an instrument\".\n\nHis father, Uma Dutt Sharma, came from a family of priests, and was himself a classical vocalist and played the tabla, the traditional Indian drum.\n\nIn the early 1950s, when he was handling music programmes for a state-run radio station, Uma Dutt began researching the santoor, a traditional instrument of Kashmir used in local Sufi music.\n\nHe bought home a 100-string santoor and encouraged his young son to try playing it.\n\nYears later, Sharma recounted that he had initially resisted playing the instrument.\n\n\"My father told me, 'You have no idea what is going to happen with your name and the santoor. They are going to become synonymous. So you have to play this', Sharma told interviewer Ina Puri.\n\nBy 17, Sharma was playing both the santoor and the tabla for the local radio station. He flowered into a versatile musician, later playing the tabla for maestros such as Ravi Shankar (sitar) and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (sarod).\n\nSinger Vijay Kichlu once said Sharma made the santoor a major component of Indian classical music.\n\n\"Unlike the santoor, the sarod, the shehnai and the violin were considered major instruments, with the sarangi being used as an accompanying instrument to vocalists,\" Kichlu said.\n\nAlso, playing the santoor was not easy: the instrument is not played with the fingers. Instead, its strings have to be struck with a mallet held in each hand.\n\nSharma once said he had modified the instrument to \"suit the requirements of Indian classical music - specifically to enhance its tonal quality\". Interestingly, he was also the first musician to play the instrument, weighing eight kilograms, on his lap for hours at a time - traditionally the santoor was kept on a wooden stand when played.\n\nSome critics were \"harsh\", saying the santoor would never be accepted as a classical instrument, and told his father that his son had chosen the \"wrong instrument\", Sharma recounted in his autobiography, Journey with a Hundred Strings.\n\nBut Sharma persevered.\n\nIn 1955, when he was 17, he had turned down an offer from V Shantaram, a Bollywood director, to compose a song in his film - saying his calling lay elsewhere.\n\nBut five years later, he arrived in Mumbai looking for music-based jobs in the film industry - by then, he had also acquired a master's degree in economics.\n\n\"His work, for much of the sixties and some of the seventies, kept running like a train on two tracks - his work in cinema, and his opus on the [classical] concert stage,\" said Manek Premchand, a historian of film music.\n\nOver the years, he played to packed audiences at classical shows, where he would never play his popular music. Ravi Shankar once called Sharma a \"superstar\" who would be always \"mentioned as a pioneer in elevating santoor to the height of classical refinement\".\n\nA rare musician who effortlessly straddled both classical and popular music, Sharma played the santoor for least 40 popular Hindi film songs sung by greats such as Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Mukesh.\n\nIn the eighties, his collaboration with Chaurasia spawned many hits, beginning with Silsila, starring superstar Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nBachchan once remembered a New Year's eve during the shooting of Silsila when the duo played well past midnight at the hotel they were staying in Delhi."
