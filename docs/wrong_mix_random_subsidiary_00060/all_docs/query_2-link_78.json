        "text": "Summary of Booker Prize\n\nThe Booker Prize is a prestigious literary award given annually to the best novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Established in 1969, it was initially limited to authors from Commonwealth countries, later opening up to include English-language novels from any part of the world. The prize has undergone several changes over the years, including increases in prize money and adjustments to eligibility criteria. A panel of judges, composed of authors, publishers, and other literary figures, selects the winner from a longlist and shortlist of nominated novels. The Booker Prize aims to recognize exceptional literary talent, promote outstanding works of fiction, and stimulate interest in contemporary literature.\n\nBackground of Booker Prize\n\nIn 2023, Irish author Paul Lynch clinched the prestigious Booker Prize for his novel \"Prophet Song,\" which unfolds the tale of a woman's struggles to shield her family amidst Ireland's descent into totalitarianism and conflict. The judges hailed the book as a triumph of storytelling, praising Lynch's mastery of language and his ability to evoke powerful emotions through words. Out of 163 novels submitted by publishers from Ireland, the UK, the US, and Canada, \"Prophet Song\" emerged victorious over five other finalists. Lynch described his novel as an exploration of \"radical empathy,\" aiming to deeply engage readers in the turmoil of living within a collapsing society.\n\nNotably, Indian authors have made their mark on the prize, with several notable names among the winners and shortlisted authors. Arundhati Roy won the prize in 1997 for her novel \"The God of Small Things,\" propelling her to international acclaim. Other Indian authors like Salman Rushdie and Kiran Desai have also been shortlisted or received special recognition, highlighting the global reach and diversity of the prize.\n\nIntroduction of Booker Prize\n\nThe Booker Prize, formerly known as the Booker Prize for Fiction and later the Man Booker Prize, stands as a distinguished literary honour awarded annually to the best English-language novel published in the UK and/or Ireland. Initially, the prize was restricted to authors from Commonwealth nations, Ireland, and South Africa, later broadening its eligibility to include any English-language novel, a move met with both acclaim and controversy. Each year, a panel of five individuals, drawn from diverse backgrounds including authors, publishers, journalists, and notable figures from various fields, is tasked with selecting the winning book.\n\nThe recipient of the Booker Prize not only receives a substantial monetary award of £50,000 but also garners international recognition, often leading to increased book sales. Regarded as a significant event in British literary culture, the announcement of the Booker Prize recipient generates widespread excitement and attention worldwide. Additionally, the International Booker Prize, a sibling award, celebrates translated fiction, with short story collections also eligible for consideration. The £50,000 prize is evenly split between the author and translator of the winning novel, further acknowledging the importance of literature in translation.\n\nEstablishment and Evolution\n\nThe Booker Prize, initially named the \"Booker Prize for Fiction,\" originated in 1969 when Booker, McConnell Ltd. began sponsoring the event. Over the years, it became widely known simply as the \"Booker Prize\" or the \"Booker.\" Key figures like Jock Campbell, Charles Tyrrell, and Tom Maschler played crucial roles in its establishment.\n\nIn 2002, administration of the prize shifted to the Booker Prize Foundation, with the investment company Man Group becoming the title sponsor. Despite this change, \"Booker\" remained part of the official title. The foundation operates as an independent charity funded by the profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd.\n\nFinancial Evolution:\n\nOriginally, the prize money awarded with the Booker Prize stood at £5,000. This amount doubled to £10,000 in 1978 before reaching £50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the most lucrative literary prizes globally. Shortlisted authors also receive £2,500 each and a special edition of their book.\n\nSelection Process\n\nThe process of selecting the Booker Prize winner begins with the appointment of a panel of five judges, chosen annually by Gaby Wood, the chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation. Wood consults with a committee comprising senior figures from the UK publishing industry to finalize the selection. Judges are typically drawn from prominent literary circles, including critics, writers, academics, and public figures.\n\nJudging Process:\n\nEach judge undertakes the task of reading all submitted books, a commitment that can span several months. In 2023, judges read through a staggering 163 books over seven months. After this initial reading, the judges narrow down their selection to a longlist of 12 or 13 titles, referred to as the \"Booker Dozen.\" They then re-read these books before finalizing a shortlist of six titles. The six chosen books undergo a third reading before the judges select the ultimate winner.\n\nControversy and Criticism\n\nThe Booker Prize's selection process and the notion of a select group of insiders determining the \"best book\" annually have sparked controversy. In response, The Guardian introduced the \"Not the Booker Prize,\" allowing readers to vote for their preferred titles. Author Amit Chaudhuri has criticised the concept, deeming it absurd and inadequate for honouring writers.\n\nPerceptions and Adaptations:\n\nAuthor Julian Barnes famously referred to the prize as \"posh bingo,\" highlighting perceived arbitrariness in selecting winners. However, upon winning in 2011, Barnes humorously revised his opinion, acknowledging the judges' expertise.\n\nAward Ceremonies:\n\nTraditionally, the winner announcement took place at a formal dinner in London's Guildhall in early October. However, due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2020, the ceremony was broadcast from the Roundhouse in November, in collaboration with the BBC. In 2022, a more casual in-person ceremony returned to the Roundhouse before moving to Old Billingsgate in London in 2023.\n\nLegacy of the British Empire\n\nLuke Strongman's analysis of the Booker Prize rules established in 1969 highlights the prize's connection to the British Empire's legacy. Initially, the prize was restricted to English-language novelists from Great Britain or former British colonies, suggesting a desire to strengthen bonds among nations once under British rule. However later it shifted with a focus on emerging identities in former colonies and the notion of \"culture after the empire.\" These narratives highlight the evolving balance of power and the impact of colonialism on colonized cultures.\n\nRelated Awards for Translated Works\n\nMan Booker International Prize: Established in 2005, the Man Booker International Prize is open to any living writer worldwide. Until 2015, it was awarded biennially to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. Since 2016, the prize is awarded annually to a single book in English translation, with a £50,000 prize shared equally between author and translator. Following the end of Man Group's association in 2019, the award is now known as the International Booker Prize. In 2022, the International Booker Prize was awarded to \"Tomb of Sand\" by Geetanjali Shree from India, translated by Daisy Rockwell.\n\nRussian Booker Prize: In 1992, the Russian Booker Prize, also known as the Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize, was established in Russia to recognize literary excellence.\n\nMan Asian Literary Prize: Established in 2007 by Man Group plc, the Man Asian Literary Prize was an annual award honouring the best novel by an Asian writer, written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.\n\nCheltenham Booker Event: As part of The Times's Literature Festival in Cheltenham, an event inspired by the Booker Prize was held annually. Four guest speakers/judges debated a shortlist of books from a given year before the Booker Prize's introduction. Writers from outside the Commonwealth were also considered. For example, in 2008, the winner for 1948 was Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country, and in 2015, the winner for 1915 was Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier."
