        "text": "On 7 July, the HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal announced a major 30% reduction in the CBSE syllabus. A slight reduction in the syllabus was done in April 2020 too, but as the lockdown is extend and the Covid-19 pandemic is getting worse, the studies are getting affected and now a bigger reduction is finalized. CBSE states that “although the syllabus has been reduced, but care has been taken so that the learning outcomes remains the same”. CBSE also stated in its notification ,” though 30% syllabus has been reduced from the new academic year, teachers should ensure that the students understand these topics so that they can use the information in connection with other topics”. There’s no doubt the reduction of syllabus is a welcome move, but the actual thing here is that whether the chapters which have been eliminated by CBSE were really not that important? I personally think some of the chapters which CBSE eliminated were of great worth and shouldn’t have been eliminated.The list of some of those chapters and their importance are listed below:\n\nDEMOCRATIC RIGHTS(9th Std.) – This particular chapter talks about all the Democratic and Fundamental rights of an Indian Citizen. It explains how a democratic government has to be periodically elected by the people in free and fair manner. These Fundamentals and Democratic rights should be know by every citizen so that it can be utilized when required. The students could had learned about the basic rights , such as Right to Freedom, Right to Equality, Right against exploitation and many more along with their significance.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN(9th Std.) – India is a democratic country and there are certain rules and regulations which the citizen and the government must follow, all these rules are together called Constitution. This chapter is about this only. This chapter discusses the need to have a constitution, the making of the Indian Constitution and the guiding values of the Indian Constitution. Every Indian should know how our country’s constitution is being made and what all it consists.\n\nDEMOCRACY AND DIVERSITY(10th Std.) – India being a democratic and diversified country itself makes this chapter more powerful.This chapter teaches that the existence of social diversity does not threaten democracy. The political expression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirable in a democratic system.\n\nGENDER, RELIGION AND CASTE(10th Std.) – India is a secular country where every citizen has the freedom to choose their religion. No one can be discriminated on the basis of their caste and religion. This chapter talks about the religion differences , caste inequalities, communalisim, women’s political representation etc. I personally think this chapter is very important, as children are the future of our country and we would definitely not want if someone will suffer due to their caste or religion in the future.\n\nMONEY AND BANKING (12th Std.)– This chapter of economics talks about the money operations which are operated by the RBI and the central government. Children learn about the functioning of Cash Reserve Ratio(CRR), Statutory Liquidity Ratio(SLR), Repo and Reverse repo rate and the control of credit through bank rate. According to me this particular chapter is very beneficial to know more about how our cash related operations are handled by the RBI and government.\n\nThe Nobel prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards all over the world given to individuals who perform magnificent in the field of Physics, Chemistry, Literature, physiology, peace and Economics. The Nobel prizes, instituted 1901, are bestowed annually by the Scandinavian Committees(Denmark, Norway, Sweden, usually Finland and Island)in recognition of cultural and scientific advances. The Peace price is awarded in Oslo, Norway, while the other prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden. Each Nobel prize is regarded as the most prestigious award in its respective field and is administrative by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe story behind the establishment of Nobel prize is also spellbinding. The man behind the foundation of the Nobel Prize is Alfred Bernard Nobel, a Swedish scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, author and pacifist. The foundations for the prize were laid in 1895 when Nobel wrote his last will, leaving much of his wealth to the establishment of the Nobel Prize. Noble amassed a vast fortune during his lifetime and most of his wealth came from his 355 inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous. In 1988, Nobel’s brother Ludvig died while visiting Cannes and a french newspaper erroneously published Nobel’s obituary. It condemned him for his invention of Dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated (“The merchant of death is dead”)and the headlines read, “Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday”.Nobel was left shattered was heartbroken with what he read and thought how he would be remembered after his death. On November 27, 1895, at the Swedish- Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish The Nobel Prizes .On December 10, 1986, Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy from acerebral haemorrhage at the age of 63. Nobel, in his will, stipulated that “no consideration be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be Scandinavian or not”. And so, six years later, in 1901, the first Nobel Prizes were awarded to 3 Germans, 2 Frenchmen and a Swiss. Professor Amartya sen(born 1998) was the first Indian to receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1998 for his work on welfare economics. He has made several contributions in to this field such as, such as to axiomatic theory of social choice; the definitions of welfare and poverty indexes ; and the empirical studies of famine. All are linked by his interest in distributional issues and particularly in those impoverished.\n\nThe current relations of India and China are not hidden from anybody. It is very clear that both the countries are having disputes at the border. There was a fight between the soldiers of both the both the country and soldiers from both the nation lost their lives. The Indian government also banned 69 Chinese applications including Tiktok, Cam Scanner, ShareIt and many more, because of safety reasons. The demand of ban on Chinese products and making India self sufficient is rising more, after our lost their lives at the India-China border. But the actual question is , can India actually surpass China in growth? This seems to be a very a strenuous task , as the dominance of China over Indian market is not something which can be ignored.\n\nThe main reason behind the growth fatigue in China according to the Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) is that the cost of production in China is now the same as that in US. An increase in wages, shifting exchange rates and higher energy cost in the past 10 years resulted in manufacturing stress in China. On the contrary, labour cost is still much lower in India.However apart from the cost difference there are many more challenges which India need to tackle if it wants to exceed China. The first challenge for India is to create a friendly business environment. A culture of entrepreneurship needs to be developed. Secondly the Labour laws in India are very obsolete in nature, a big reform in the whole concept is required to usher the second generation reforms lead by the reforms in labour sector. The macro-economic stability is another thing which designs the path of the future growth of a country. The Chinese economy is controlled by government with exchange rates, interest rates etc. Although it may provide stability but also apply pressure on the controlling authorities. The Indian government needs to keep the financial rights by keeping a tab on inflation, exchange rate etc. The another factor which our government need to focus upon is the Investment on Human Resource. The number of unskilled labors in our country is quite high, whereas the it is never a problem for China because they have invested enough in their Human Resource.The Indian government should provide skills to its vast labour force. The last but not the least factor which I will be discussing here is sufficient energy. For a firm, continuous supply of power and electricity is must so that they can continue their production without any hindrance.\n\nThus, there is no doubt that exceeding China in terms of growth is an impossible task for India, but for this the government needs to lay down the platform for the economy to take off and address the aforesaid challenges.\n\nThe word Bollywood is a play on Hollywood, with the B coming from Bombay (now known as Mumbai), which is the center of the Indian film world.The word was coined in the 1970\n\nAs their popularity grow, movies created in the Mumbay’s reached the number of 200 annual movies, West continued to ignore cinema efforts of Indian filmmakers, but they acknowledged them when India managed to overtook America as the biggest producer of movies in the world.\n\nIn 1913 and the silent film “Raja Harishchandra”the first-ever Indian feature film and First full-length Bollywood silent movie.Its producer, Dadasaheb Phalke, was Indian cinema’s first mogul, and he oversaw the production of 23 films between 1913 and 1918 Dadasaheb Phalke is considered the father of Indian cinema.\n\nIts great success paved the way for the countless movies that followed him and the expansion of the indian cinema industry to incredible heights. One of the largest successes of that time was “Alam Ara” from 1931, sound movie that became basis of the joyful modern Bollywood musical. First Indian Colour movie “Kisan Kanya” was created in 1937, but such movies found popularity only in late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nGaining independence from the British Raj was tough and spanned from 1857 to 1947 – lasting a gruelling 900 years. However, the struggles in gaining India’s independence enthused the film industry. Some of the most critically acclaimed films in Indian cinema were created during this time and explored the difficult working-class life in India and the reality of urban life.\n\nIt was around 1947 that the industry went through significant changes. The historical and mythological stories of the past were now being replaced by social-reformist films, The 1950s saw filmmakers such as Bimal Roy and Satyajit Ray focusing on the lives of the lower classes, who until then were mostly ignored as subjects.\n\nGolden Age of Indian cinema took place between 1940s and 1960s. During that time countless influential Bollywood movies were released, exploring new storytelling techniues, social themes (mostly struggles and wonders of urban life), epic productions such as Mother India (1957). This period also popularized many Indian actors (Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt) and actresses such as (Nargis, Vyjayanthimala, Meena Kumari, Nutan, Madhubala, and others).\n\n1950 – The decade of extreme close-up The black and white era of 1950s was marked by songs shot in static frames with all the action happening through the eyes and eyebrows of our lead actors. So from extreme close-ups of the face to some relevant cut-ins of the moon, the flowers and the rustling of leaves, Bollywood songs welcomed more elements of dynamics of romance. Leading from the 1960s to the early 1970s came the birth of Modern Bollywood Cinema. This included the domination of two distinct genres: boy-meets-girl romance films and gritty action productions.\n\n1960 – The decade of pure dance and enchnating eyes\n\nActors like Vyjayanthimala, Waheeda Rehman and Mala Sinha slowly brought dance in the 1960s. Songs like “Honton Mein Aisi Baat” and “Piya Tose Naina Laage Re” resonate not just the beauty of these divas but also the sanctity of songs of this era. Even in their guest appearances Helen, Bindu and Aruna Irani became the perfect face of RD Burman’s tracks in the 1970s. They either happened inside the villain’s den or were meant to add thrill to the climax. From “Piya Tu Ab To Aaja” to “Mera Naam Hai Shabnam” and “Chadti Jawani Meri Chaal Mastani”, the songs of this phase still hold a place in our party playlist.In the 1970’s the name “Bollywood” was officially coined as conventions of commercial Bollywood films truly became defined.\n\n1980 – The decade of growing romance.\n\nCome 1980s and the royal reign of RD Burman continued Parveen Babi and Zeenat Aman lead the epic playlist of this era. “Pyar Mein Dil Pe Maar De Goli” had as much stuff happening in the song as in “Pyaar Karne Wale”.\n\nMusic and songs in this period were intimately connected to the storyline. They were written and woven as per the requirements of the film and in the respective situations.While Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammad Rafi, Asha Bhonsle, Kishore Kumar and Hemant Kumar were the mainstay of the playback singing scene, big actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor gave them the apt face value. This perfect combination reciprocated well onscreen too. Bachchan’s songs were either playful or had intense action happening (not literal fighting but the thrill of the climax).\n\nTowards the second half of 1980s and early 1990s, we had films like Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Ram Lakhan, Saajan and Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin – all musical blockbusters. On the other side of the camera, it introduced us with the voices of Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu, on the front these songs majorly had a dreamy set-up, making anyone fall in love. There was romance, longing, betrayal and confessions and every aspect was shot with a proper screenplay of its own. Each song, be it “Pehla Nasha”, “Ae Mere Humsafar”, “Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin” or “Bahut Pyar Karte Hain”, made us believe in love.\n\n1990 – The decade of Celebration.\n\nThe 80s and 90s brought back spotlight romantic musicals and family-centric films, and in 1995, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was released. Becoming the highest grossing Bollywood film of the year and one of the most successful Indian films its soundtrack became one of the most popular of the 1990s. Even today, the film has been showing at a Mumbai cinema, Maratha Mandir, since its original release in 1995. A portion of the 1990s also introduced us to the three khans, madhuri dixit and others.\n\n2000 – The decade of quick moves\n\nBollywood finally managed to reach outside of India and land in the West. Many of their lavish productions received significant box office success all around the world, especially after the critical success of “Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India” in 2001.\n\nFourteen days into the new millennium, Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai launched Hrithik Roshan overnight superstardom.\n\nDil Chahta Hai (2001) was differentThe songs by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. One of its lines, appropriately, announced – Hum Hai Naye Andaz Kyun Ho Purana. penned by Javed Akhtar give Dil Chahta Hai a socio-cultural perspective.\n\nA lot was going on in the 2000s. Single screens started to make way for multiplexes. The Hindi film industry, leaving the days of dubious underworld fundings behind, was being corporatised.Stars reinvented themselves. Amitabh Bachchan started acting his age. Aamir Khan – enabler, collaborator, producer and not just actor – promised quality mainstream entertainment, and delivered on most counts Rang De Basanti,Taare Zameen Par,3 Idiots,Hera Pheri (2000) helped find Akshay Kumar, an action star in the 90s, his sublime comic side. Shah Rukh did some of his most loved films – Kal Ho Na Ho (2003), Swades (2004) and Chak De India (2007); Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om.\n\nLage Raho Munnabhai – which established Raju Hirani as a major director .\n\nNew faces like Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai added to the star value. Both being brilliant dancers with beautiful personalities shone onscreen. Aamir’s antics in tracks like “Aati Kya Khandala”, made each of their song a national favourite. And amid Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham to fix any loose ends. This phase saw the canvas of songs grow to exorbitant levels. Bollywood has inspired films overseas including Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire which won four Golden Globes and eight Academy Awards, and Moulin Rouge which director Baz Luhrmann says was influenced by Bollywood Musicals\n\n2010 – The decade of New era\n\nAs 2000s entered its second decade, the “item songs” were back and with more action. 2010 alone gave us two of the biggest recent tracks – “Munni Badnaam” and “Sheila Ki Jawani”.\n\nThis was the Ranbir Kapoor-Deepika Padukone-Anushka Sharma-Ranveer singh phase giving movies – Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani, Bajirao Mastani,Ramleela, Sui Dhaaga Their songs emphasised their beauty as the camera moved in and out of their face to their chiselled appearance.\n\nIn years to come, Abhishek Chaubey’s revisionist dacoit film, Sonchiriya, and two fine festival titles from 2018:\n\nhistoricals (Manikarnika, Panipat), war films (Uri: The Surgical Strike), action blockbusters (War),patriotic (Kesari)\n\nAlso blockbuster Khan’s gave ,Bajrangi Bhaijaan,sultan , My name is khan,Raees, Dangal and PK, and he made a killing overseas and Secret Superstar.\n\nShahid kapoor –Jab We Met,Kabir Singh ,Ayushmann khurrana – Dum laga ke haisha, Dream girl, bareilly ki barfi, Sushant Singh Rajput – Kai Po Che, Chhichhore, M. S.Dhoni, Rajkummar Rao – Stree and Pankaj Tripathi. This new Middle Cinema dovetailed with arthouse film Masaan.\n\nThis decade, several actors joined Manoj Bajpayee and Irrfan Khan- Hindi Medium in the fertile middle ground between superstardom and niche acclaim. Nawazuddin Siddiqui broke through in 2012 with Kahaani and Gangs Of Wasseypur.\n\nA number of Indian films from different regions are often included among the greatest films of all times in various critics and directors polls.Indian Cinema will be eternal as decades move on…."
