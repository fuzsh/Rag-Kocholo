He has more than twelve years of teaching experience at UG and PG level. His major research area is as Mathematical Aptitude, Mathematical Epistemological Beliefs and Mathematics Education. He has published more than 10 research papers in UGC care listed and approved journals. The area of his teaching is Pedagogy of Mathematics, Educational Statistics, Distance Education and Open Learning. He has participated more than 35 national seminars, workshops and conferences in the capacity of participants as well as resource person. He is also working in different committees of DTE, SoE, Central University of South Bihar, Gaya. Additionally, he has also performed the responsibility of an ‘Observer’ in CUCET-2017.
