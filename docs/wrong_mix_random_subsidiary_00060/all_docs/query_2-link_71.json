        "text": "My heart and thoughts go out to the Professor Balasubramaniam's wife, his two daughters, and his family. Although I never knew the Professor personally, I have heard nothing but wonderful things about the professor through a student of his. I was told the professor bought a spark to the department with his energy and was always enthusiastic to help students. Of all the wonderful things I have heard about, what surprised me the most about is the Professor's dedication to the field of study even till his final days. Although the professor might not be alive, it can be assured he will live on for a very long time not only through his impressive professional work but also through the lives of many students he positively impacted. Walt Whitman long ago summarized my feelings: \"I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste, affectionate, compassionate, fully armed; I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold, And I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation.\"\n\nBala and I were classmates at IT-BHU. I feel privileged to have known him during the five years I spent there. I remember Bala as a remarkable person, multi-faceted and talented, one who lived his life to the fullest, with a smile on his face, and a hand extended in friendship to those around him. Best of all, despite his many gifts, Bala was astonishingly humble. Years later, I happened to hear of his many accomplishments at IIT-K, his research, and the books he had authored, and I still remember the flush of pride I felt at reading about the achievements of someone I had known personally. I will miss Bala deeply. A wise person once said that only the good die young. How true that is in this case. He has been taken from this world far too soon. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family.\n\nThis is a shocking loss for all of us. We in the chemistry department remember his electrifying lectures on the iron pillar as well as on the cannons of India. His exuberance and warmth would rub off on every one who came into contact with him. It was a great privilege to know and interact with him. Only earlier this year I was admiring his beautiful work on the analysis of the angulam system used in the construction of the iron pillar as well as the Taj Mahal. I remember the passion with which he described this work to me. He worked with an unbelievable intensity. His contributions to corrosion and archeometallurgy are substantial and he made a lasting impact in these areas of research. It is a great tragedy that a brilliant career and a wonderful human being were cut short in their prime. Our heart felt condolences to the bereaved family. May his soul rest in peace.\n\nProfessor Balasubramanium (Bala) was one of the best teachers I have seen. He was very dear to me. He joined almost the time when I was finishing my B.Tech. and joining my M.Tech. We had organized a musical program in Guest House and practice use to go on in his residence (SBRA). A positive and highly enthusiastic and sharp person. I pray to God that we all rmember the dynamism and enthusiasm in Bala. Besides he was our neighbour (I stayd in 601) and close to my dada and family. After a long gap we had couple of meetings with him. He liked our work on evidences of production of nanoparticles in ancient Indian and wanted me to published in a Journal of Indian History. Recently he had come to IIT Kharagpur for defense of a student and Ihad a long interaction with him ragarding my professional life and I am grateful to Bala for his close guidance. It is a shock for me and my parents (Prof. A. Ghosh and Dr. R. Ghosh), my sister Sudeshna to loose Bala at such a less age. I pray to God that I can always BE INSPIRED BY THE POSITIVE SPIRIT AND DYNAMISM OF BALA. Sudipto\n\nTwo years ago, in my account of a match, I had written about Balas dismissal:  the umpire gave him the finger. He returned to the pavilion, withdrew from everyone else, and lay down on a bench. He wasnt to get up until after the end of the match. Now, the Great Umpire in the sky has raised his finger against Bala and, this time, there will be no getting up. Try as I might, I cannot quite pinpoint the year that Bala first played with us. What I do remember is that I was very pleased to note that his wicket keeping was founded on sound technique. I was captaining the side at the time and welcomed the arrival of someone who could relieve me of the wicket-keeping responsibilities. Later, when he put on some weight and became slow behind the stumps, he picked up the new ball and quickly became one of our strike bowlers. Wicket keeper, lead bowler and middle order bat, Bala was almost indispensable to FCC. It seems inevitable that he will be just as indispensable to the cricket team in the Great Beyond, for there can be little doubt that the first thing he will look for there is the cricket ground. While we mourn our loss, I can well imagine the great rejoicing with which he is being received there even as I pen these words. Over the years, Bala has regaled the FCC with his outlandish humour and his unremitting optimism. On cold, clammy and dark mornings, his sunny disposition was the only light that warmed us. On bad cricket days, when the more serious ones like me had given up, Bala would rouse us all and bring the match back to life. His lusty cheering was the clarion call that made us rejoin the battle even when all seemed lost. The Great Umpire has given his decision, but did we hear anyone appeal for Balas wicket? I reckon that it was a harsh decision. Many, many others at IITK seem to agree.\n\nIt is a great loss to the country and IITK alumni. May the God bless his soul in peace. Wish Family gets strength to fight against post effects. Near and dear people are requested to help the family. We were perhaps the first bach, he was taking matarial science core course in our 3rd sem in 1991. His voice and enthusiasm still echo from lecture hall. Remember you as a great friend for students. I myself have lost the battle against cancer for my 9 yr young son and lost him few months back. This disease kills entire family on many fronts, emotionally, financially and sometimes socially as well. Request people to contribute generously for cancer research and treatment. For family, i want to say Live with hope for your young daughters. One of my German Colleague advises that Every morning starts with a new day and new chance in life. Destiny cannot be rolled back. I fully share the grief and believe that the soul never dies. Sunil Kumar class of 1994\n\nI was shocked to hear this sad news and am still not able to come to terms with this fact... He was really a gem of a person and undoubtedly one of the finest professors the IITs could ever have. He really went out of the way to inject enthusiasm in all of his students. I remember the very first words of his in the first course I did under him\" you all should not see me as a teacher, rather look at me as your elder brother\". As time passed by we all realized that he meant every word of it! He was an outstanding teacher and a great human being and he will always remain there in our memories.\n\nDated : 11.12.2009 CONDOLENCE MESSAGE The BHU-Met family is deeply shocked to learn the tragic and sudden demise of one of its illustrious alumnus, Professor Ramamurthy Balasubramaniam on December 9, 2009 at 2.20 a.m. at his residence in IIT  Kanpur. Prof R. Balasubramaniam (fondly known as Bala) was bron on April 15, 1961 in Salem, Tamil Nadu. He graduated as Bachelor of Technology in Metallurgical Engineering from the Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University in 1984 with First Rank and also won the coveted Gandhi Medal in that year as best all-rounder. He then proceeded to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, USA for obtaining his Ph.D. Degree in Materials Engineering in 1990. He soon returned to home country to join the Faculty of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, IIT-Kanpur in April, 1990 where he rose to the position of B.B. Lal Chair Professor before he breathed his last. Prof. Balasubramaniam had a brilliant research career and made lasting contributions to the field of Metallurgical Engineering by way of 250 research papers in reputed journals and 10 books. Noteworthy amongst those are his two recent books The Saga of Indian Cannons and Story of Delhi Iron Pillar which attracted worldwide attention. In recognition of his meritorious performance, he received a number of awards and distinctions. Prestigious amongst these are Young Scientist Award of INSA (1993), Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship (1996), Materials Research Society of India (MRSI) Medal (1999) and Metallurgist of the Year Award of Ministry of Steel and Mines, Government of India (1999) and most recently (the first to receive) the Distinguished Educator Award of IIM (2009). Besides for academics, Bala is widely remembered on the campus of the Banaras Hindu University for outstanding performance on percussion instruments during Kashi Yatra and other cultural festivals. He is survived by his wife Dr. Gaitri Saini Balasubramaniam and two daughters, Gowri and Gargi. The BHU-Met family deeply mourns his untimely demise and prays the almighty to give all the strength to bear this irretrievable loss. The BHU-Met family\n\nProf. Bala often used to inform the defense enthusiasts on www.bharat-rakshak.com about the ancient Indian metallurgy and Indian canons. BR community is very sad to know that they have a lost a great contributor. On behalf of BR, I express my condolence to Dr Balasubramaniam's family. Below are some of the messages from BR members. The sad loss of a truly great Indian. His work will remain as a testament to his dedication in his field of expertise and his pioneering work on ancient Indian metallurgy,a field in which the country today is sorely in need of experts like him.We were priviliged to have had him contribute to BR and express our sincere condolences to his family.May his soul rest in peace. - Philip My sincere and heartfelt condolences to Dr. Bala's family. Indeed, a great son of India and a teacher par excellence! His work will be a testimony of a life well lived and an inspiration for millions of Indians of as a glimpse into what it is to be an Indian. His work is a product of an unshackled mind with a full understanding of the legacy of bharitya thought. May God grant him peace and solace to his family. - Raja Ram I distinctly remember him for his saltpeter comment in another thread and those words echoed in my ears for long time, that \"India exported the saltpeter and, by that had the whole world blown up, including India\"! Sad to note this tragic loss. May your soul rest in peace! - dipak Other messages can be read at RIP: Sad demise of BRFite Prof. R. Balasubramaniam http://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5323\n\nI was 2 years senior to Bala at IT-BHU. Bala was a ray of sunshine all through BHU-IT. He was one of the juniors who right from the beginning interacted with other batch years and across different engineering disciplines. He was very involved with many aspects of the IT Cultural Association (ITCA) and later the IT Gymkhana. Always willing to try new things. I remember when he came to our band practice and decided to try to play drums and took it up and got really very good at it. He volunteered for a lot of cultural activities and was a key member who contributed to the establishment and success of Kashi Yatra. Only after associating with him for a while and seeing him as a happy-go-lucky guy did I find out that he was a also \"topper\" material and very good academically as well. Knowing Bala, I am sure he led a happy and fulfilled life and brought a lot of joy to others. To his family, I say this: As the long list of contributions on this page show, he is remembered with love and affection, he was a joy to be with and made the world a better place.\n\nMy sincerest and deepest sympathies to Balas wife Gowri and their children on Balas untimely passing.I was a classmate of Balas from ITBHU Metallurgical Engineering class of 1984. Bala had a joie de vivre and a tremendous energy and enthusiasm for life that we all found tremendously contagious. I remember him as always smiling, and always ready to help others. I worked alongside him in helping organize the first Kashi Yatra, as part of a large team of organizers, and his drive and enthusiasm was always apparent in all his actions and words. As has been noted elsewhere in his obituary, Bala was truly academically gifted and topped our class for all the years we were at ITBHU. He went on to achieve fame in the field of Metallurgy, when many of us drifted away from that field. Besides his obvious brilliance, he gave us all at ITBHU the benefits of his considerable talent in other fields (mainly music, and cricket). My father met Bala at Balas home in Salem when we were still at ITBHU and still remembers him fondly. I was personally looking forwward to meeting him at our reunion next week at ITBHU and am extremely saddened that I will not see him any more. Sincerely, Tajan R. Kenkre\n\nI am and my father and all the members of my family deeply shocked to hear the news of untimely demise of Prof. R. Balasubramaniam. In this hour of grief, I wish my deep condolence to his family and friends. May the Almighty rest his noble soul in peace. I also pray to God to give strength to his family, to his homely wife, to the little girls to get over this terrible loss of such a dear father and pray of Him bless the children with all the next best things in the world with His own hands. When i meat with him in 2004 he told me my father (Mr. V. P. Srivastava, Retired Employee of M.M.E. IITK ) is one of the best Person in the world, very honest, intelligent, hardworking. i remember and miss you alot.An irreparable loss to IIT Kanpur and Materials Science Community but, we have lost one of the best teachers and a kind human being. May the Almighty rest his noble soul in peace.\n\nBala, as we used to call him, was a year senior to me in IT,BHU. I always admired his flamboyant style, the way he used to appraoch his life be it in academics, sports or in the field of music. For us he was more known for his drumming and guitar skills and was a wonderful cricketer too. Remember playing with him in Inter Year matches at Kings Pavilion. Kashi Yatra, the annual cultural fest of ITBHU, was an event where Bala used to be in full bloom. He was an Icon for ITBHU in any of the cultural events. It is my misfortune that since 1985, the first news I came across about Bala is about his heavenly abode. May God rest his soul in peace and give strength to the members of his family to bear this loss.\n\nI was deeply saddened by the news of the sudden passing away of Bala. I have always held him up to others as the ideal for all students of Metallurgy to emulate. In his Banaras days, apart from being the topper in the class, he was very good in sports, being the captain of the University Cricket team, a champion athlete, probably the first one to earn the IT \"Blue\", and an accomplished drummer who helped to set up a separate Western Music section in IT Gymkhana. And a delightful debater and public speaker as well. Subsequently he earned a highly acclaimed Ph.D. from the USA and did the unthinkable of returning to India to take up a faculty position at IIT-K. There he continued to make an indelible impression not only on students but also on the Indian Metallurgical community with his pioneering work on Delhi Iron pillar. His adaptation for India of the popular \"Callister\" book on Materials Science is a lasting and useful contribution to the cause of Materials Science education in India. The pinnacle of his achievements was the memorable International Conference at IIT-K in December 2007 in honour of the 80th birthday of Prof. T R Anantharaman, a great tribute paid by a great student to a great teacher. Above all he was a wonderful human being. His untimely passing away at such an young age is a deeply felt and irreparable loss to the cause of Metallurgy in India. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family and to all his close friends. May his soul rest in peace.\n\nFew words in memory of Bala My Dear Sister Smt. Gayatri Gaouri Gargi Millions of men and women come and go from the world, but only few people leave their impression on this earth. Among the few Bala is one who left his indelible mark and impress as a metallurgist and archaeometallurgist of India. I am indeed shocked and very much grieved to know the untimely demise of Professor R. Balasubramanyam, known as Bala, a well-known, reputed, renowned and distinguished metallurgist and archaeometallurgist, who is not only a bosom friend of mine but also know less a person than my younger brother. 3rd September 2005 is a remarkable and ever memorable day in my life because that day I got Bala as my good friend, philosopher and guide. During these five years he changed my life and as he said he introduced me to the world of archaeometallurgist. Because of him I am being invited for four international conferences in these two years. It was he, who gave me impetus to go ahead with my research work and indeed he was the source of full encouragement and inspiration for me to proceed with my work on Iron and Wootz Steel survey work in Telangana and also cannon cataloging in Deccan which has been the most endearing subject of Bala. He was so simple, noble and humble that he treated me as his own elder brother giving me total support, to carry on our joint venture and to work in the remotest areas of Deccan region to catalogue and study the cannons and archaeometallurgy sites and because of him I could publish good number of articles in INSA Journal of History of Science. I cannot forget that he has written a wonderful foreword to my book, entitled Iron and Wootz Steel Industry in Northern Telangana which received high degree of appreciation and admiration at national and international level. He was also instrumental and played a pivotal role in getting the said book released in an international conference held at Hyderabad on 29th January 2009. But for his inspiration, I frankly state, that I would not have completed the said book so soon. His time to time guidance and valuable suggestions received from him are also incorporated in the book. In the foreword of my book, he was kind enough to mention that he was fortunate enough to be associated with me in this work, but in fact I am the luckiest person to be associated with such a great scholar of international repute like Bala. He gave me a chance to work with him in the Cannon Project. Indeed he was concerned more than myself on submitting my research papers in UK and USA which shows his selfless spirit of fraternity and brotherhood. It was his material and moral support that made me capable of submitting my presentations in UK on 17th Feb 2009 and in USA on 27th March 2009, otherwise a person like myself working in a remote corner in a rural area of Telangana would not have come to lime light...contd"
