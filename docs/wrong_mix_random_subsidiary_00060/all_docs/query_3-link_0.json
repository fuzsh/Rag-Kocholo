        "text": "There are very few people in the world who are so famous that their names are often replaced by their initials. One of them was a native of Ireland. The initial letters of his name are G.B.S. I think he was the most famous writer of his time. A book has been written on his incredible life story, the title of which is not even his name, only three letters G.B.S are written on the title page. George Bernard ShawÛ” G.B.S born on July 26, 1856, and raised by a low-income protestant family in Dublin, Ireland. Shaw's life was full of strange contradictions, he had only five years of schooling, but despite his lack of education, he has been recognized as the greatest writer of his time and received the awards in life that a writer always expects. The greatest honor of their life is that he won the Nobel Prize in Literature and he was the first writer to win both the Nobel Prize and the Oscar. The household finances were so poor that Bernard Shaw was forced to work for a living at the age of fifteen. During the first year of his employment, he worked for less than a pound a month, then from the age of sixteen to the age of twenty. He continued to serve as an in-charge treasurer. His weekly salary was 35 shillings. But he hated this office work. It was due to him that he was brought up in a family where knowledge, art, and literature were the candles of music. Shortly before his twentieth birthday, G.B.S said to himself: \"you get only one life, I will never let him fall victim to office confusion.\" So in 1876 he left his job and moved to London where Bernard Shaw began his literary career. Which gave him wealth and fame in the world. He would force himself to write five pages every day., not much, only five pages. Shaw said about it \"The student and the clerk still lurked within me. If the fifth page ended in the middle of a sentence, I would leave that sentence unfinished and finish it the next day.\" In nine years, he wrote five long novels, one of them called \"Love among Artists\". He sent the draft of each of his novels to every publisher in England and America, but everyone sent them back. In the first nine years of his literary career, he first earned 5 pounds by writing an article on a new drug. He got the sixth pound once by counting the votes in the election. His first literary and financial success turned out to be his plays rather than his novels. It is a different thing that all his initial plays failed. It is not believed that Bernard Shaw, was an excellent and high-class orator capable of addressing large crowds. At one time he was suffering from shyness, and an inferiority complex. In this regard, he has said that \"The suffering of shyness bothers me so much that sometimes I hesitate to knock on the door of a friend's house and sometimes due to hesitation, I turn away from his place.\" Read full biography ðŸ‘‡ https://lnkd.in/duD7pgHa"
