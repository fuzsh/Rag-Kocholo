        "text": "BENGAL — The land of many Rivers. Very important in shaping the History of INDIA. Stone Age remnants date back 5000 yrs.

Archeological established that Bengal region had well developed civilization before Aryan came in this area. Some of the old sites early first millennium BC are Paharpur (Bangladesh), Mahastangarh (Bangladesh) Mainamati (Bangladesh) & Mangalkot in Burdwan District, Chandraketugarh in North 24 Parganas, Pandu Rajar Dhibi in Birbhum and Tarafeni valley in west Midnapore District.\n\nThe culture of Bengal was different than Vedic people.\n\nBengal was the easiest route to Himalayas and became commercial hub that connected by road to the famous Silk route. Bengal had Sea trade links with Java, Sumatra, Siam and China through its port at Chittagaon.\n\nBengal Prince Vijaya Simha conquered Lanka in 544 BCE and named Sinhala.\n\nThe Kings and Emporers of Bengal ruled whole of Eastern India up to Burma, Tibet.\n\nBengal had mix of Religions/periods — Vedic — Jain — Budhism — Islam — Sufi — Zarasutra — Jewish — Christian and several other small sects including Tribal sects. Tribal sects were Folk Religion and worshipped nature Gods and Shakti — Trees, Yakshas, Nag Devta and animals.\n\nRecent development says Sunderban was hub for making herbal medicines.\n\nBengali Kings Chitrasena and Sanudra Sena were great Warriors.\n\nIt is said that Alexander the Great retreated after knowing super Army strength of Bengal King Xandrammes (300 B.C.). At that time Bengal was referred as Gangapidai and whose forces had mighty warriors — huge infantry, Elephants, Horses, Chariots — all trained and equipped for war.\n\nEarly rulers of Bengal:\n\nMaurya Dynasty — Chandra Gupta Maurya — Ashoka Maurya — 324 BCE — 272 BCE.\n\nChandra Gupta accepted Jain Religion and Ashoka Budhism. Maurya Empire was converted in small Districts and small Rajas became in control with small areas without strong army and could not defend attack from North West. They also kept on fighting among themselves. There was no central force to tackle invaders from outside.\n\nGauda Empire — 590 CE — 626 CE.\n\nKing Shashanka strong Ruler developed Bengal`s Architecture and Bengali Calendar. He drove Budhist out of Bengal. His Capital was Karna — Suvarna (now Murshidabad). Period 600\n\nCE and 637/7 CE.\n\nSmall period by Varman Dynasty and Khadga Dynasty.\n\nMALLA Dynasty (650–750 CE) Bankura — Mall Bhume. Last Malla Kingh was Kalipada Sinha Thakur. Ruled Malla Bhum from 1930 to 1983.\n\nPALA Empire: Pala means Protector. It was the largest Bengali Empire (750–1120 CE). Golden Age of Bengal. Raised standard of Bengal culture and politics. They were supporters of Bhudhism. Supported educational institutions of Nalanda and Vikramsila.

They hailed from South India Kannada Kings.\n\nBallal Sena made Nabadeep as Capital.\n\nChatur sena started getting Brahmins from Mithila — South India and other parts of India.\n\nHe established administration frame work (very important decision).\n\nThey were Hindus and cultivated Vedic Religion and introduced Sanskrit. Budhism almost disappeared in this period. Last Emperor was Madan Pala. When I visited Nabadeep I was told it has more than six hundred temples. The guide could not tell me much. But now I can see it was Sena empire who started building temples and Nabadeep gave birth to Chaitanya Maha Prabhu — Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri — Bhupendra Nath Sanyal — Frankly it is like Kashi and Vrindavan of Bengal.\n\nDeva Dynasty: Ruled for some time. Capital was Bikrampur — present Munshigang District of Bangladesh. Deva Dynasty endured after Muslim conquests.\n\nThen came Looters — Socio Political integrity of Bengal was under severe crisis.\n\nKhilji Dynasty (1200 CE — 1230 CE) Mamluk Sultanate (1227 CE — 1281 CE). The Tughlaq Sultanate (1324 CE — 1339 CE) Ilyas Shahi (1435–1487) Suri (1532–1555).\n\nThen came Mughals. They had high regard for Bengal and were aware of the richness of the region.\n\nNawabs: Murshid Quli Khan last Mughal Subedar of Bengal region of Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah born a Hindu Brahmin in Deccan India. He took the Throne as the Nawab of Bengal. He renamed Karna — Suvarna as Murshidabad.\n\nKoch Dynasty 1515–1949: The Princily State of Cooch Bihar was included in the political map of Bengal after Independence. They ruled Northern region of Bengal. The famous palace still stands in Cooch Bihar city. Famous personality Maharani Gayatri Devi.\n\nAfter death of Murshid Quli khan in the 18th Century Marathas invaded Bengal but could only capture parts of Bengal & Orissa.\n\nBritish came to Bengal in the year 1757 — battle of Plassy — Nawab Siraj Ud Daulah was defeated because his Minister Mir Jafar betrayed him.\n\nSati Regulation: Lord William Bentick banned Sati practice in all jurisdictions of British India on December 4, 1823 under East India Company rule.\n\nHindu Widow remarriag : Social Reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar championed Widow Re-marriage.\n\nThe Hindu Remarriage Act 1856 enacted on 26 July, 1856 legalised the Remarriage of Hindu Widows in all Jurisdiction of India under East India Company Rule. Drafted by Lord Dalhousie and passed by Lord Canning.\n\nFort William in Kolkata — beginning became Capital of British and remained till 1911.\n\nStart of Bengal Renaissance (means Re-birth)\n\nIt was product of:\n\nFirst hand reaction with the colonies the people of Bengal became advance in modern science, business, literature, culture, and social & economic.\n\nEconomic boom due growth of Kolkata. It became world class business centre. Many industries like Jute, Tea, Steel and Textile weaving took place.\n\nGrowth of new middle class and a professional class.\n\nIt produced stalwarts who changed the face of Bengal.\n\nGrowth of an independent press both newspapers and periodicals. Bengal Gazette was founded in 1780.\n\nIn 19th & 20th Century free thinking was encouraged among students. Caste discrimination was condemned. During the Bengal Renaissance literature and culture progressed and made Bengal almost top educational hub of India. Many students from all over the country started coming to Bengal for higher education.\n\nRaja Ram Mohan Roy, Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Swami Vivekanand, Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, Satyendra Nath Bose, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, C.R.Das, Ashutosh Mukherjee, Keshab Chandra Sen, Bipin Chandra Pal, Henry Louis Vivian Derozio were the pioneers of the Renaissance and propelled the movement forward and made Bengal the face of Progress and Culture in India.\n\nIn 1772–1833 Ram Mohan Roy founded Reform Association “BRAMO SABHA” (BRAMO SAMAJ) in Calcutta. Started Women education — Girls started going to Schools — Thanks to Vidyasagarji. Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya 1875 — Girls School 1st setup. It came allover India. Tarabhai Shinde & Pandita Ramabhai both from Pune introduced in Pune.\n\nIn 1929 the Child marriage restraint act was passed.\n\nWe all know post Independent Bengal.\n\nBengal suffered from great famines of 1776 and 1942 and partitions of 1905 & 1947. But the will of the people of Bengal made Bengal prosperous again. The partition of 1905 by Lord Curzon was a Policy to divide and rule Bengal. New capital was created Dacca with Muslim majority province of East Bengal & Assam. The leadership of Congress was very vocal and against this partition.\n\nAt this time new national sentiment born in Bengal “Vande Mataram” and became Congress`s National Anthem. At the same time Bengal started Swadeshi movement.\n\nCOMMUNISM IN BENGAL\n\nThe seed of Communism movement started in 1920s. It is said that Communist Party of Russia sent delegation to Gandhiji and tried to convince him that India is ripe because peasants not happy and many poor people. Gandhiji refused and said this country has seen enough blood shed and since philosophy of Communism is based on violence and no God I will not allow to spring Communism in India.\n\nIn 1967 Naxalbari North Bengal movement took place. It was violent.\n\nDuring 1970`s — 1980`s Marxist — Naxal movement damaged the State with series of strikes leading to a period of economic stagnation. Further the infrastructure was significantly strained by Bangladeshi Refugees after war of 1971 followed by Small Pox epidemic during 1974 but Govt handled OK.\n\nLeft Front came to power (CPI.M) in 1977 and ruled for 30 years till 2011. West Bengal which was India`s most prosperous state reduced to poor state by 2011. Sad! Many Intellectuals, Businessmen, Senior Managers & workers left Bengal because they found future bleak and migrated to South-West and North India. Howrah — hub of small Engineering activities was shut almost. Kolkata was flooded with small buyers from all over India for purchases have stopped coming out of fear. For higher studies most students from other neighboring States came to West Bengal for studies because of legacy of education. They stopped coming and started moving to Delhi — all because of fear.\n\nI went to Gujarat to buy m/c. I saw a Bengali gentleman waiving and wanted to see me. Ofcourse I can recognize face of Bengal. I asked how come you are here. He said I came here with workers because peaceful working in factories HA HA. He gave me good discount against wish of owner.\n\nLast Chief Minister Budhadeb Bhattacharya sincerely tried to revive States economy inviting Industrialists from globe and other parts of India. But probably it was late. Most of them were fearful. I personally attended several meetings at Indian Chamber of Commerce seminar during Presidentship of Mr. S.K.Bangur and saw Budhababu`s attitude was very positive. I personally told him to retrieve small Industry segment in West Bengal because with less investment one can get more workers.\n\nWest Bengal could not get much advantage of economic reforms in India introduced in the early 1990 by Dr.Man Mohan Singh Central Govt.\n\nI pray to Maa Kali to make Bengal prosperous again. I love Bengal My Bengal. It has intelligent people — water — power — skilled labour — less expensive work force — legacy of education. Please come to Bengal and set up Industries — small — medium — large any. Love people — they are yours. No fear now.\n\nBAY OF BENGAL:\n\nThe Bay of Bengal was known as Kalinga Sagar and also called Chola Sea.\n\nLater during British India it came forth as Bay of Bengal. Bay of Bengal has many Sea Ports name — Kolkata Port, Visakhapatnam, Dhamra & Chittagong — also others.\n\nCoastal Regions bordering the Bay of Bengal — all rich in Minerals.\n\nIt is centrally located in South & South East Asia. It lies at the centre of two economic blocks the SAARC & ASEAN.\n\nSamudra Aarti is a daily tradition in Puri.\n\nBRAHMINS IN BENGAL\n\nFirst Brahmin named Varahasvamin of the Samved School was granted land in 433 CE by Kumar Gupta -1 of Gupta Dynasty.\n\nCategories of Brahmins in Bengal: Radhi — Vanendra — Vaidika — Saptasati.\n\nIt is said that Sena Dynasty brought Brahmins in Bengal for Yagna and Administration. The name of King Ballal Sena — Chatur Sena — Vijay Sena — also Raja Shyamal Barman.\n\nFrom Mithila — Kanauj — other parts of U.P. and Orissa and also from South. They were from Vedic School. They were mostly engaged in Govt Administration work like Revenue — Tax collection etc. Because in those days only Brahmins were well educated. Today also Brahmins are in a big way in Administration and education in West Bengal.\n\nProminent Known Brahmins:\n\nBagha Jatin — great leader of Bengal — in his name famous BBD Bagh.\n\nSurendra nath Banerjee — First Indian to pass ICS Examination.\n\nDwarkanath Tagore — First Industrialist of Bengal.\n\nRabindra Nath Tagore — won Nobel Prize of Literature.\n\nAbhijeet Banerjee — won Nobel Prize on Economics.\n\nBankim Chandra Chatterjee — Novelist & Poet\n\nSharad Chandra Chatterjee — Novelist and Poet.\n\nBudhadeo Bhattacharjee — CPM Leader and Ex-Chief Minister of W.Bengal\n\nMamta Banejee — current Chief Minister of West Bengal.\n\nProminent known Brahmin in Bengal:\n\nThey gave knowledge of worship and Wisdom to the World!\n\nChaitanya Maha Prabhu — Born in Nadia in 1485.\n\nMy Param Gurudev Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Maharaj born in Ghurni, Krishnanagar in 1828.\n\nRam Krishna Paramhans — born in Hooghly Dist. Village Kamar Pukur in the year 1836.\n\nVishudhananda Paramahansa born in 1853 in Bondul Village — Burdwan District.\n\nAurobindo Ghosh — born in Kolkata in 1872\n\nMy Gurudev Bhupendra Nath Sanyal Maharaj born in Sadhana Para, Nadia in 1877.\n\nGODESS DURGA & KALI IN BENGAL:\n\nDurga Puja started in Bengal from the 14th Century but major Durga Puja festivals started from 16th Century when wealthy families were sponsoring Durga Puja. The prominence increased during British period. Besides Religion it is very much a Social & Cultural festival in Bengal involving Dhak playing — Sindoor Khela — Homa and Bhog, Dhunuchi haach — Dhunopora & others.\n\nBefore 14th Century it was known as Warrior Godess celebrated by Kings and his Arm forces. Said in Rigveda. It is said that Devi Maha+maya (also associated with Durga) 400–600 C.E. However the worship of Durga in Hinduism is very very old but in form of Shakti. Historians can tell better.\n\nThere exists variation in worship practices and Rituals with Durga Puja. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the community concerned. Different localized rituals can be observed regionally. I see the beauty of Hindu Religion — the flexibility — no bhandan — full freedom. How it can be a fanatic religion. Hinduism absorbs the heart of every locals — every regions of this country. Hindu Religion`s biggest advantage is freedom of worship.\n\nKALI PUJA — also known as Shyama Puja. It is said noted 16th Century Tantric Scholar Krishnananda Agamaraghisha was the one who started Kali Puja in Bengal.\n\nFor me very difficult to write about Goddess Kali. Kali Puja is a big festival of Bengal. Famous Kali temple close to my house is visited by many people from all over India and locals daily. It is said Kali gives blessings easily to all (a nature of Lord Shiva). Philosphers say she destroys ego and other demons (negativity) inside you.\n\nGodess Durga & Kali are not same. They both are form of Goddess Parvati, the wife of Shiva. Some says Kali is Supreme in Dus Mahavidya and they are all incarnation of Shiva — Bhairav. All Dus mahavidya is Shakti. Their devotees are blessed always. Mine Maa “Bagla Mukhi”.\n\nMARWARIS OF BENGAL\n\nIn 17th Century Saharwale Oswal Jain Merchants from Bikaner began migrating to Bengal along with trail of Mughal armies. Marwari community which had been thriving here since the 18th Century firmly established itself in the city by the time of Independence.\n\nMarwaris traditionally entrepreneurs found peaceful co-existence with locals led them to prosper. Most Marwaris speak fluent Bengali — Many of them educated in Institutions like Hindu School (Bengali Medium).\n\nI came to Calcutta at the age of 9. Now 73. Found this Green city very friendly — cultured — educated — intelligent. Always felt I am Bengali.\n\nHa…Ha…when a Marwari wakes up think how to make money…when a Bengali gentleman wakes up think of culture. In my small company 99% working people are Bengalis. One Bengali girl rose to the position of Director on merit.\n\nBengalis are not racist. Marwaris learned culture of land like Painting (Art Rickshaw run by Marwari women), Singing, Dancing, Drama — becoming more Bengalis than Bengali. Marriages taking place between Marwaris and Bengalis.\n\nMost of the Marwari families are not rich. They are in job and profession as well.\n\nI know some Marwaris (though many) who enjoyed prominent political position in West Bengal like Speaker of the Assembly, MLAs, MPs, Mayor etc.\n\nOne gentleman D.P.Khaitan was member of Drafting Committee to scrutinize the Draft of the text of the Constitution of India (out of seven members).
