        "text": "Summary of Self Help Groups\n\nSelf-Help Groups (SHGs) are micro-entrepreneurial groups, primarily composed of women, aimed at alleviating poverty and enhancing economic empowerment. Originating in the 1970s, SHGs gained prominence in India in the 1990s, particularly through initiatives like the SHG Bank Linkage Project. These groups follow a structured process of formation, capital accumulation, loan access, and income generation, engaging in various activities such as agriculture, handicrafts, and small businesses. The benefits of SHGs include improved nutrition, gender equality, and resilience against poverty. However, SHGs face challenges such as economic limitations, regional disparities, socio-cultural barriers, and accountability issues. Efforts by the government, such as National Rural Health Mission, SHG-Bank Linkage Programme, and MGNREGA engagement, aim to address these challenges and promote SHG development. In essence, while SHGs have made significant strides in empowering communities and combating poverty, concerted efforts are needed to address their challenges and maximize their potential for socio-economic development.\n\nBackground of Self Help Groups\n\nThe concept of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) originated with Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus in the 1970s but gained traction in India, notably with the establishment of the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in 1972. However, it wasn't until 1992 that the movement saw significant growth, propelled by NABARD's SHG Bank Linkage Project, the world’s largest microfinance initiative. This period also saw the establishment of separate organizations by state governments in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala to combat rural poverty. A pivotal moment came in 1993 when NABARD and RBI permitted SHGs to open savings bank accounts, paving the way for greater financial inclusion. Subsequently, in 1999,the Swarn Jayanti Gram Swarojgaar Yojana (SGSY), later renamed the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) in 2011, and Deendayal Upadhyay Antyodaya Yojana – in 2015, was introduced to promote self-employment in rural areas through SHG formation and skill-building.\n\nIntroduction of Self Help Groups\n\nA Self Help Group (SHG) is a group of micro-entrepreneurs, mostly women, who voluntarily come together to undertake an economic activity for capital and skill development with the objective of bailing themselves out of extreme poverty and misery. They decide to save small sums of money by mutually agreeing to contribute to a common fund to meet their emergency needs. A group of about 10-20 women pool their financial resources to make a fund which is available to members in times of need. The members are allowed to borrow from the pool and pay back through regular periodic installments and keep a record of all transactions.\n\nJEEViKA\n\nThe Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Project (BRLP), launched on October 2, 2006, with funding from the World Bank, introduced the \"JEEViKA\" program under the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society, registered according to the Societies Registration Act 1860. The program's fundamental principle involved establishing a three-tier community structure comprising Self-Help Groups as primary units, Village Organizations as secondary entities, and Cluster-Level Federations at the tertiary level. Aimed at fostering economic and social advancement among rural poor, particularly women, the initiative aimed to empower them towards self-reliance. From 2008 to 2020, JEEViKA alone impacted around 12 million women in Bihar.\n\nSEWA\n\nThe Self-Employed Women’s Association of India (SEWA) is a trade union established in 1972 by Gandhian and civil rights leader Dr. Ela Bhatt. It focuses on empowering poor self-employed women workers in India. SEWA members are women who earn a living through their own labor or small businesses. The primary objectives of SEWA are to organize women workers for full employment and self-reliance. Additionally, SEWA aims to integrate marginalized, impoverished women in the informal sector into the mainstream economy and uplift them out of poverty.\n\nLijjat\n\nShri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad, commonly known as Lijjat, is an Indian women's cooperative founded in 1959 with the vision of empowering women through employment and livelihood opportunities. Conceived by Nilesh Mansata from Kolkata, Lijjat initially operated from Lohana Niwas, a cluster of five buildings in Girgaum. Although it originated as a cottage industry in urban areas, Lijjat has expanded its reach to rural regions, becoming a symbol of female empowerment in India. Notably, Lijjat's production process remains manual, reflecting its commitment to generating self-employment for women. However, certain administrative tasks and accounting procedures in some Mumbai branches have adopted computerization. Additionally, Lijjat emphasizes promoting literacy and computer education among its members and their families, aligning with its broader mission of women's empowerment.\n\nConclusion of Self Help Groups\n\nTo enhance the effectiveness of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and advance women's empowerment, several recommendations can be considered. Firstly, implementing comprehensive capacity building, training, and skill development programs tailored specifically for women engaged in SHGs is essential. Additionally, establishing a system for thorough rating and categorization of SHGs based on their performance and impact could facilitate identifying areas for enhancement and allocating resources more effectively. Organizing frequent awareness camps by Rural Development authorities can also be beneficial in educating and mobilizing communities towards the advantages of SHGs. Moreover, incentivizing banks and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) to increase funding for SHGs, such as offering additional credit scoring in Priority Sector Lending (PSL), can further enhance their financial sustainability and outreach. Lastly, promoting gender sensitization initiatives to challenge societal taboos and stereotypes concerning women's roles and capabilities is critical for fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for SHGs and women's empowerment."
