Bera and Priyasmita Ghosh\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)\n\nOctober, 2020\n\nPrologue and Family\n\nAs per the Indian mythology, Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu was the eighth child of Devaki and Vasudeva. Coincidentally, our Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao, was the eighth offspring of his parents, mother A. Laxmikantamma, and father C.D Naidu (1879-1940). Although Rao was universally addressed as Dr Rao by all his students and colleagues at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), where the “Professor” title was exclusively reserved for Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis (PCM), the history of his birthname is quite interesting. Not only that he was named after Lord Krishna, but also his middle name symbolizes the purest form of romance. Rao always claims that though he is a romantic by temperament, yet all his romance is somehow in the wrong place, that is in his head instead of his heart! Below we present photographs providing details about Rao’s lineage and his big family in 1931, respectively.\n\nC.R Rao’s siblings. Like Krishna C.R Rao was the eighth child of his parents\n\nWith family 1931, sitting on floor (from 1 to r): Thiappanna, Venkateswara, Radhakrishna and Ramachandra. Sitting on chairs (from 1 to r): Sanjeevamma, Chellamma (father’s sister), father C.D. Naidu (with grandson on his lap), mother Laxmikanthamma (with Neelavati on her lap) and mother’s grandmother. Standing (from 1 to r): Policeman in attendance to C.D. Naidu, Narsamma, orderly in attendance to C.D. Naidu, Sakuntalammma and a poor boy staying with the family\n\nAt age 15: Published in the Mrs. A.V.N. College magazine\n\nContinuing with the spirit of Radha and Krishna, let us consider the following excerpt from\n\nthe lyrical Sanskrit poem Gita Govinda, by the 12th century poet Jayadeva1:\n\n“And, led by Radha’s spirit,\n\nThe feet of Krishna found the road alright; Wherefore, in bliss which all hearts inherit, Together taste they Love’s divine delight.”\n\nThe significance of the above lines will indeed constitute the essence of this essay i.e. one can’t really talk about the life and work of Dr. Rao without referring to PCM and ISI. In fact, in a way, PCM, Rao and ISI, form a trinity where PCM can be viewed as the father, Rao the son and statistics (or more specifically ISI), the holy spirit. Let us take some liberty in paraphrasing the above excerpt from Jayadeva in this context as:\n\nSo PCM guided, and led by Statistics’ spirit,\n\nThe feet of CR Rao found the road alright; Wherefore, in “numbers” which all hearts inherit, Together they uplift ISI’s sight.\n\nIn 1989, Rao wrote a book “Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work” [CSIR Ramanujan Memorial Lectures] and nothing is more fitting than his own life as the best empirical evidence of “Putting Chance to Work.” The story of his joining the ISI in 1941 as a “statistics trainee” by a chance encounter is well known. However, such an inspirational story can’t be recounted enough. It was a hot summer day of June 1940. The World War II (WWII) was raging in full swing with its devastation, and at the same time promising jobs to the vast unemployed youths of India amid all that chaos. Rao, not yet 20 then set out on a 500-mile train journey from the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, India to Calcutta, the second largest city of the British Empire, after obtaining a first class first degree in mathematics and with a glimmer of hope of finding a job in the military. Rao was not so “lucky”; he was deemed too young for the job. However, while in Calcutta, through a chance encounter, he visited the ISI founded in 1931 by PCM, a Cambridge-trained physicist. As a last resort, he applied for the one-year training program in Statistics at ISI, with a letter of recommendation from the vice chancellor of Andhra University, Professor V. S. Krishna, who was known to PCM. Very promptly, he received a positive reply from PCM admitting him to the one-year program of the ISI from January 1, 1941. And as we all know the rest is history. In fact, a very long history. Rao did not get the job he came for but found something that would keep him engaged for the next 80 years of his life and the engagement still continues.\n\nPublications: Two Masterpieces by 30\n\nAfter Rao passed M.A. in. statistics with record marks in 1943, PCM offered him a part-time lectureship at the Calcutta University (CU). In 1944 Rao was giving a course on estimation to the senior students of the master’s class at CU, where he mentioned without proof Fisher’s information inequality for the asymptotic variance of a consistent estimate. There a bright young student Vinayak Mahadev Dandekar (VMD) (1920-1995) who was of the same age as Rao raised the question whether such an inequality exists in finite sample. Rao didn’t know the answer in the class; however, at night in his tiny apartment, with a simple application of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, Rao solved the problem and discussed the result in the next class!\n\nVinayak Mahadev Dandekar (VMD)\n\nWhile writing a note on this result for publication, Rao discovered many related results. Since the publication of Sankhyā, a journal started by PCM in 1933, was suspended during the WWII, the paper was published in the Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society (1945)2. Quite interestingly, the same WWII brought Rao from Vishakhapatnam to Calcutta and eventually to ISI! Instead of asking what is in this paper, one should ask what is not? It has, i) Cramér - Rao inequality, (ii) Rao-Blackwell theorem, (iii) Differential Geometry for the first time in Statistical literature, and finally, (iv) Fisher- Rao metric. Any first graduate course in statistical inference will be incomplete without the above two results, (i) and (ii). Here, we think, one should not overlook the origin of Rao’s 1945 paper, i.e., the question raised by the student VMD. He later became the Director of Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune and did pioneering work on poverty, unemployment and income inequality in India. Just imagine what would happen, if in classrooms we have students like VMD and also teachers like Rao!\n\nIn his second masterpiece, that appeared in the Proceedings of The Cambridge Philosophical Society (1948)3, Rao introduced altogether a new test principle, famously known as Rao’s score (RS) test, as an alternative to Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio (LR) and Wald (W) tests. Thus, we now have another “holy trinity” in statistics, namely LR, W and RS. The seed of the paper was planted in Calcutta in 1944. That too is an interesting story.\n\nS.J. Poti who joined the ISI as a teaching assistant found himself without a place to stay in Calcutta. Observing Poti’s plight, Rao offered to share his small single room in the fourth floor of a building. The room had no kitchen, and they shared a bathroom and toilet with all the tenants of the fourth floor. They had no cots and would spread their beds on the floor to sleep at night and then roll the beds up in the morning. The two used to go for long walks in the evening, often discussing problems in statistics. One day Poti asked Rao whether the Neyman-Pearson (NP) theory could be used to test a hypothesis about a parameter when the alternative is one-sided. Rao gave an immediate solution that was published as a note in Sankhyā (1946)4, which using the NP lemma showed that a locally most powerful (LMP) test must be based on the score function, i.e. the derivative of the loglikelihood with respect to the parameter, evaluated under the null hypothesis. This little obscure note can be viewed as a precursor to the Rao’s pathbreaking 1948 paper, though the general idea for RS test evolved in natural way while Rao was analyzing some genetic data. The problem was estimation of a linkage parameter using data sets from different experiments designed in such a way that each data set had information on the same linkage parameter. Thus, like most of Rao’s work, the RS test is an example of a statistical method motivated by a practical problem.\n\nThe importance of RS test in statistics and econometrics cannot be overstated; it is one of the most useful tools in evaluating and testing statistical and econometric models. Also, there are many well-known tests in the literature that were suggested long before 1948, whose theoretical foundation can now be buttressed by RS test principle. As mentioned above, RS test requires estimation of the score function only under the null thus facilitating a huge simplification of the final form of the test statistic. In most applications, RS statistic has a simple close-form expression which is quite unthinkable, in many cases, for the LR and W tests.\n\nOne of us (Bera) has a first-hand experience in using the RS test in devising the following widely used test for normality, popularly known as the Jarque-Bera (JB) statistic first published in 19805:\n\nJB= √𝑛 [(√𝑏1)2 + (𝑏2−3)2],\n\nwhere n is the sample size, and √𝑏1 and 𝑏2 are, respectively, the sample skewness and kurtosis. JB was derived using the Pearson system of curves as alternative (to normality)\n\nhypothesis, for which LR and W are almost impossible to apply. Not only the RS principle leads to a neat and beautiful expression, but also it uncovers the optimality implications, namely LMP, of using sample skewness and kurtosis. JB and its various extensions have around 8,000 citations. It won’t be an exaggeration to say that Bera’s whole livelihood had been based on RS.\n\nWe can pick up each paper of Rao and go through its origin and underlying history; however, that would be a very long exercise, not suitable for this essay. Thus, to cut the long story short, below we present a graph of Rao’s number of publications over the last eight decades (1941-2019).\n\nThe publications of Rao from (1941-2019)\n\nClearly, there is a structural break around the year 1980 when he took the mandatory retirement from ISI at the age of 60 and move to the University of Pittsburgh, U.S.A. Simple counting says, he published 203 papers by that time, and another 271 papers over the last 40 years. Dr. Rao’s research had significance beyond statistics and econometrics, like the Quantum Cramér-Rao bound providing sharper versions of Heisenberg's Principle in Quantum Physics. He has made a major contribution to the combinatorial theory of design by extending the notion of orthogonal Latin squares through the notion of orthogonal arrays6. In the last two decades, he has also touched upon non-linear methods, resampling methods, neural networks, and data mining. It is inspirational to see how a man who is about to cross a century, is determined to stay up-to-date in the main stream of modern statistical learning and data mining.\n\nRao, The Master Guide\n\nAfter Raj Chandra Bose and Samarendra Nath Roy left ISI in 1949 and 1950, respectively, and PCM got busy with national planning, Rao became the natural successor to the leadership of research and training of the institute and was the doctoral thesis adviser of many bright students. Over his full academic life, Rao has directed the research work of more than 50 Ph.D. students who in turn produced more than 350 Ph.D.’s.\n\nAbout our very own Professor Ranga Rao at UIUC7, we note, “Ramaswamy Ranga Rao is a prominent Indian mathematician. He finished his Ph.D. under the supervision of C.R. Rao at ISI, Calcutta. He was one of the \"famous four\" students of Rao in ISI during 1956-1963. Ranga Rao is now professor emeritus of mathematics at University of Illinois. He made fundamental contributions to statistics, Lie groups, and Lie algebras.” The four, K. R. Parthasarathy (KRP), Veeravalli S. Varadarajan (VSV), S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan (SRSV) and Ramaswamy Ranga Rao (RRR) are known as fabulous (fav) four in ISI legend. VSV joined the institute in 1956 and in a marked departure, instead of Statistics, he decided to work on Probability Theory, and started his research career by learning the necessary mathematics by himself within a year or so. RRR and KRP became partners of VSV, and quite coincidentally like VSV, they also had B. Sc. Honours degree in Mathematics from the University of Madras. VSV completed his Ph.D. in 1959, and in the same year SRSV came to ISI as a Ph.D. student8. SRSV later went on to receive the Abel prize of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences (considered as an equivalent to the Nobel prize, there being no Nobel prize for Mathematics) in 2007. Like each of the previous three, he also did a B. Sc. Honours from Madras before coming to Calcutta. Although, at times helped by the brilliant statistician Raj Bahadur, it was Rao who provided the encouragement and guidance to this “fav four.” Rao created a wonderful academic atmosphere for young scholars to carry out their perennial discussion on mathematics, most of the time conducted in Tamil. There is a funny anecdote about a non-mathematician and non-Tamilian6, who claimed to have learnt a Tamil word “ergodicity” from overhearing this intense discourse taking place among the “fav four.”\n\nDr. Rao had an unorthodox modus operandi while guiding Ph.D. students. His first Ph.D. student was Debabrata Basu whom he recruited in 1950. The celebrated Basu’s theorem arose out of a question Rao put to Basu, about the existence of maximal ancillary statistic. Basu proved the nonexistence of such a statistic, and in addition established the independence of an ancillary statistic and the minimal sufficient statistic. In a recent interview in “Bhāvanā”9, KRP mentioned that on advice of C.R. Rao he read the “Mathematical Foundation of Information Theory” by A.Y. Khinchin10, but was not satisfied with one particular chapter. KRP rewrote that chapter which involved learning some ergodic theory and about the probability measures invariant under transformation. KRP sent it to Joseph L. Doob of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), and who in turn gave it to measure theorist, John C. Oxtoby. Oxtoby wrote and published a paper giving full credit to KRP11. In those days, there were no regular fellowships at ISI and whatever Rao decided was the scholarship amount. When KRP showed Oxtoby’s paper to C.R Rao, his scholarship was doubled. That was the kind of incentive Rao provided to his Ph.D. students.\n\nDuring the 1962 ISI convocation time, Dr. Rao asked KRP and SRSV to suggest a prominent scientist from USSR who could be invited. The duo suggested the most famous of all, the legendary probability theorist A.N. Kolmogorov (ANK). Rao’s response was simply, “No problem. We will get him.” Rao put a word to PCM who in turn put the right word at the right time to the USSR Academy of Sciences. ANK, possibly the most important visitor that ISI has ever received, came on April 14 1962 and stayed till May 12. ANK’s visit testifies the importance Rao paid to students’ needs and suggestions. The visit was a huge moral booster for not only the fledgling young ISI probabilists but also for the whole of India, all the more as ANK rarely travelled outside USSR.\n\nRao’s guidance went far beyond Basu and the fav-four. During 1960’s Rao had five or six students working for Ph.D. at any given time, including I.M. Chakraborti in design of experiments; R.G. Laha in characterization problems; J. Roy in multivariate analysis; A.C. Das and Des Raj in survey sampling and A. Matthai on quality control. Very substantially if not wholly, the cluster of these brilliant and creative Ph.D. scholars of C.R. Rao enthroned the ISI to its golden period during 1960s.\n\nRao’s Foresight on Computer Technology\n\nLong before the era of digital revolution, Rao wrote the book “Computers and Future of Human Society” published in 196912. Being a visionary, he anticipated that the path to economic development and prosperity, is tied to the use of the computers, at a time when less than 1% of the world knew the use of computers. In his words, “We need computers to guard our land frontiers and the long coasts, save us from floods and fury of storms, defend ourselves against external aggression, improve our agriculture to feed the teeming millions, give the best education to our children, help in better medical diagnosis and save the lives of patients, and provide the people with necessary comforts, facilities and opportunities in life.”\n\nComputers and Future of Human Society published in 1969\n\nHe traced the history of computers, both hardware and software and analyzed questions like: “Is the human brain superior to the computer? Are we likely to succeed in producing a robot identical with human being in all respects except in origin?” that were much ahead of their time. He laid out that computers can prove to be a great boon for a developing country like India, to close the productivity gap with some of the advanced countries of the world. But he also admitted that there is a dangerous possibility that robots controlled by computers would run factories, and today it is not a secret that many jobs have been lost to automation.\n\nFrom Rao’s book on calling a computer from a console typewriter. Beginning of the “work at home”!\n\nHe pretty much forecasted the future of the world lies in computer programming, and we are now witnessing that every day in our lives. The field of computer programming, especially machine learning is experiencing exponential growth today while in Rao’s time, computers were hunks of machinery, the size of a room. Rao wrote about Anne (shown in the photo above), “She is looking forward to the day when such a console typewriter in installed in her home as telephones are now. She can utilize the computer which may be far away sitting at her home and any time.” Rao anticipated that the day is not far when a computer console will be installed in every home and almost envisioned that one will be able to utilize it at any time to get access to any type of information, like checking email, surfing internet and having all kind of data at fingertips. Rao perceived the world with computers in ways that we never thought was possible.\n\nRao visited the UIUC, in 1953–1954 as a visiting research Professor of Mathematical Statistics. During his stay at UIUC, he had access to Illiac, the first digital computer in the United States. He took a course on programming using machine language and started using the computer to do his own computations. The UIUC gave him two students to work on developing computer programs for statistical methods. But unfortunately, on returning back to India, Rao didn’t have an opportunity to use computers, and his research involving heavy computations was not possible with hand-driven desk computers. The ISI had acquired a digital computer, but the workers’ union at the ISI protested the use of computers. This obstructed the possibility of creation of computer-intensive statistical techniques in India well before others did. This was such a big disappointment for Rao that he was even ready to resign; however, PCM and other administrators of the ISI persuaded him to withdraw the resignation.\n\nThe Women Behind the Man\n\nRao dedicated his book “Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work,” to his mother A. Laxmikantamma, and credited her “For instilling the quest of knowledge” in him and “who woke him up “every day at four in the morning and lit the oil lamp to study in the quiet hours of morning when the mind is fresh.” Rao remembers his mother as a great disciplinarian, and she controlled the daily activities of her children, prescribing the time for playing, studying, and sleeping. This regiment later helped him in leading a disciplined and successful life. He had very little contact with his father until he retired as he was a police officer that required him to be work at different locations.\n\nRao was fortunate to have parents who fostered his innate abilities with proper guidance, provided an environment conducive to study, and gave a framework for ethics of life. He himself admits that genetics played an important role in his achievements and goes on to say “I inherited my father’s analytical ability and my mother’s tenacity and industry.”\n\nRao with his wife Bhargavi during their stay in UIUC, as a visiting professor of Mathematical Statistics in 1954\n\nOn returning from Cambridge to India in August 1948, Rao got married on September 9, a day before his 28th birthday. In the initial days of their marriage, Bhargavi, struggled to keep up with the activities of Rao; however, soon she realized the importance of the work that he was doing and adjusted herself to the life of an academician. She supported Rao and provided him with an environment at home to pursue his research peacefully. She had two master’s degrees, one in history from the Benaras Hindu University in India and another in psychology from the UIUC. In Calcutta, she worked for some years as a high school teacher and for a number of years as a lecturer . Rao and his wife were happily married for over 65 years, before she passed away in 2016.\n\nMrs. Bhargavi Rao narrated a funny anecdote about her husband, in the book, “Putting Chance to Work; A Life in Statistics: A Biography of C.R. Rao” by Nalini Krishnankutty13, published in 1996. Once a visiting scientist came from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, to meet with Dr. Rao personally. He knocked on the door to be opened by Mrs. Rao and enquired about Dr. Rao. He was amazed that like the Soviet scientists, Dr Rao did not live in a big guarded house. She told him that her husband was downstairs near the car. He replied that he had only seen a mechanic working on the car, but not C.R Rao. Then Mrs. Rao informed him that it was not just any mechanic, he had actually seen The C.R. Rao. The visitor returned in the evening and saw Rao playing badminton with his colleagues and the next day he went to the ISI office to meet the Director of ISI. To his surprise, Dr. Rao was the Director, sitting in a room resembling a cubicle with only the flap door closed and easily accessible to everyone. Dr. Rao invited him home for dinner and welcome him like a perfect host, with vodka and Russian caviar. The visitor while leaving the house exclaimed, “I have seen the mechanic, the athlete, the scholar and the perfect host, all in one day.” Like Lord Krishna had (108) names and roles- Dr. Rao wore many hats and that too so successfully.\n\nRao’s daughter Tejaswini is an accomplished Indian classical (Kuchipudi) dancer and runs a dance school. She has a Ph.D. in nutrition and is a Professor at SUNY, Buffalo. In 1970 Rao moved to ISI, Delhi and was surprised to find that there was no dance school to teach Kuchipudi. Because of his interest in Indian classical dance, Rao started a Kuchipudi Dance Academy in Delhi and was its President until he left for the U.S.A in 1979. Rao and his wife admitted Tejaswini in a dance school at the age of eight. When she performed in public, Rao often supervised the performances, the music, the introductions, and the lighting. No matter how busy he was he would always take the time to ensure the performance was well planned. He made her do demonstrations of abhinaya in English translations of her dance music. This is very common now during the Indian dance performances, but it was unheard of in the early 60s. So in this matter too, Rao was well ahead of his time. Rao had an artistic vision and dancers today follow techniques, that were made to Tejaswini more than half a century earlier. Tejaswini now regrets that she didn’t take on some of his suggestions and act on them more seriously. Currently Rao is taken care of by Tejaswini at her Buffalo home.\n\nTejaswini admits that she and her brother Veerendra didn’t know much about their father during their stay in India, as Rao never talked much about himself. It is only after he moved to the U.S. that they learned about him as a scientist and as a person who is a very sensitive and caring person, with a great but subtle sense of humour. His family wished that he would take some time off to enjoy with them; however, Rao’s greatest pleasure in life comes from being immersed in work and research.\n\nRao’s daughter Tejaswini, striking a pose\n\nRao Modesty and Magic\n\nOne of us (Bera) was involved in preparing the Econometric Theory (ET) Interview with Dr. Rao14 , at the invitation of the Editor: Professor Peter C.B. Phillips (PCBP). As the interview went along, its size grew longer and larger, and at one stage, it was almost 100 typed pages. Rao became worried and his modesty was expressed as “Are you sure the whole text will be published?”, as in the handwritten note below.\n\nDr. Rao’s note to Bera on April 6, 2002\n\nWith a lot of trepidation, Bera submitted the interview to ET on May 31, 2002, expecting a response in a few weeks, from the Editor, most probably with a lot of suggestions to cut down the size. Quite surprisingly, within a week, apt came the Editor’s letter of acceptance without a single correction (reproduced below)! This is simply Rao magic.\n\nNot only that, the Editor also send the following email to Rao:\n\nHere, quite fittingly, the Editor marvels at the historical insights provided by Rao that will be read and enjoyed by not only econometricians but the wider community of statisticians.\n\nEpilogue and Celebrations\n\nGiven that my academic career started with RS Test and still continues, I (Bera) have always been in touch with Dr. Rao for research and on special occasions. None of my emails/letters has gone without a prompt reply from Dr. Rao. I wish I were equally prompt with his letters and emails. On the occasion of his 77th birthday in September 1997, I sent him Birthday wishes with a sketch by eminent Indian artist Charu Khan. Rao appreciated it very much and sent a warm reply back.\n\nRao’s sketch by painter Charu Khan\n\nRao is recognized internationally as a pioneer who laid the foundation of modern statistics, with multifaceted distinctions as a mathematician, researcher, scientist, and teacher. His contributions to mathematics and to the theory and application of statistics have become part of graduate and postgraduate courses in statistics, econometrics, electrical engineering, and many other disciplines at most universities throughout the world. Rao is loved and respected all over the world. His birthdays are celebrated by the entire econometrics and statistics community with great enthusiasm, internationally.\n\nRao’s 80th birthday celebration at the University of Texas, San Antonio, 2000\n\nRao’s 90th birth anniversary celebrated at the ISI, Kolkata 2010\n\nFor his outstanding research contributions, C.R. Rao has been honored with the establishment of an institute named after him: C.R. Rao Advanced Institute for Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (C.R. Rao AIMSCS), in Hyderabad, India. It is a fitting tribute to Rao, since he hails from this part of India. The institute is engaged in cutting edge research in the areas of Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Wireless Communication and interdisciplinary fields. Fittingly, the C.R. Rao Birth Centenary Celebrations started at the AIMSCS on his 99th birthday, September 10, 2019 with a video message from Rao himself (a screenshot of that is given below) .\n\nIn his message, Rao said, “I was fortunate to have made some fundamental contributions to the field of statistics and to see the impact of my work in furthering research. In my lifetime, I have seen statistics grow into a strong independent field of study based on mathematical, and more recently computational, tools. Its importance has spread across numerous areas such as business, economics, health and medicine, banking, management, physical, natural, and social sciences. Statistics is the science of learning from data. Today is the age of data revolution. There is therefore, a heightened need for statistics- both in terms of training in statistics to help analyze and interpret the data, and in terms of research to answer new questions arising from the data.15” This succinctly sums up the long statistical journey of C.R. Rao and also indicates that it is the Data Science what is stored for the future of Statistics.\n\nC.R Rao, as he enters the centenary year, September 10th 2019\n\nThe 2019 International Indian Statistical Association (IISA) Conference at Mumbai, India on Dec 26th - 30th, 2019 brought together statisticians worldwide from academia, industry, government, and research institutions to explore the latest developments and challenges in the era of Data Science and Statistical Learning. For that occasion Tapan Nayak, a former Ph.D. student of Dr. Rao organized the C. R. Rao Honorary Session with following four presentations:\n\nA new all-purpose generic multivariate transformation with applications in multivariate modelling and missing value imputation, Ravindra Khattree, Oakland University.\n\nAnalyzing periodic and nearly periodic data: Statistical perspectives, Debasis Kundu, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.\n\nShailaja Suryawanshi, Merck & Co.\n\nThe Trinity: Professor Mahalanobis, Dr. Rao, and the ISI, Anil Bera, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).\n\nIncidentally, Shailaja was the last Ph.D. student of Dr. Rao to graduate from the Pennsylvania State University in 1996 with a dissertation titled, Analysis of High-Dimensional Data in Problems of Regression and Discrimination, with Applications to Size and Shape Analysis. The Session was very well attended followed by a very lively discussion.\n\nOf course, there will be many more tributes coming to Rao in coming months and years analyzing his research contributions. However, we should not forget the man, or the “life” behind all the work—the humble and the unassuming person. Here we can only borrow a couple of lines from Rabindranath Tagore to express our feelings for Rao, “You are greater than your achievements. The chariot of your life leaves your achievements behind, time after time.”\n\nত োমোরকীর্ িরতেয়ে ুর্মতেমহৎ,\n\nপশ্চোয় তের্িেো েোে কীর্ ি য়র ত োমোর\n\nবোরম্বোর ।\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Professor Arijit Choudhuri for his kind invitation to contribute an essay on the occasion of C.R. Rao centenary. We are also thankful to Yufan Leiluo for his comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this essay. All omissions and misreadings are ours.\n\nRendezvous with Nobel Laureate Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow\n\nby Dr Anil K Bera\n\nApril 16, 2021\n\nAnyway, we landed at Willard Airport safe and sound. A future colleague received me and on our way from the airport, he proudly stated that Willard was the University’s own airport and explained the barren fields on the two sides of Neil Street as the most fertile land in the world. He added that my accommodation had been fixed at the tallest building in town, the University Inn on John Street. I was also put at the top floor of the hotel so that I could also get a good view of the town.\n\nAfter dinner, I went to my hotel room and pulled the curtain to have a view. The narrow John Street was dark and deserted. The only sign of life was a colorful signboard flickering in the dim street light. It read, “Cosmopolitan Club.” Next day I dropped by the club, and met some wonderful students. That was my first introduction to Urbana-Champaign outside the department where I joined in the Fall of 1983. During the 1980s I became more familiar with the Cosmopolitan Club, and over the years my initial impression turned into great admiration for this great institution. Therefore, Cosmopolitan Club has a very special place in my heart.\n\nLet me now get back to the topic and begin at the beginning—100 years ago—Fall semester 1906. A student from India encountered a quad preacher who was popularly known as Billy Sunday. The student was shocked to hear Billy Sunday’s very unkind remarks about other religions. The student did not have enough courage to challenge Billy Sunday on the spot. To fulfill his civic duty, he sent a mild protest letter to the student newspaper, the Daily Illini. It had the effect of throwing a stone at a beehive. The student was assailed from all quarters. Quite frightened, he almost decided to pack up and go back to India. And then there appeared a strong editorial in the Daily Illini, supporting the Indian student’s view and his every right to express it. And that saved the day.\n\nMany of you would know that (assistant) editor of the Daily Illini; he was Carl Van Doren (1885-1950), a senior year student at the University of Illinois. Later, he became one of the most famous literary critics. He was literary editor of the Nation (1919-1922), Century Magazine (1922-1925), The Cambridge History of American Literature (1917-1922), The Literary Guild (1926-1934) and Columbia Encyclopedia. And the Indian student was Rathindranath Tagore. I will simply call him, Rathi. He is one of the two Tagores I’ll talk about. The other is Rathi’s famous father, Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel Laureate poet, writer, painter, and educational reformer. I will talk much less about the senior Tagore. He is quite well known at least in this town through the annual Tagore Festival.\n\nThese two students—Carl Van Doren and Rathi Tagore—epitomize what the University of Illinois stands for. Carl Van Doren was born in a small town called Hope, near Danville, just a few miles from here. Rathi Tagore came from Calcutta, the then Capital of India, and the second largest city (after London) under the British Empire, 10,000 miles away.\n\nBut why did Rathi come all the way to a then-provincial town for higher studies? During the early part of the last century it was not common for Indian students to come to the United States. They would rather go to England to study law or to sit for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) Examination for a lucrative job under the British Raj.\n\nChance played a big role in his coming to the University of Illinois. An Indian charitable organization planned to send some students to the United States to study science and industry. Rabindranath Tagore asked his son Rathi and Santosh Majumdar, son of a friend of his, to join the students, and study at an American University which provided training in agriculture. Rabindranath was convinced that to uplift the rural India, adoption of technology, and scientific methods in agriculture were essential. Rathi and Santosh secured a letter of introduction to a professor at Berkeley.\n\nAll the students had to come through Japan, where they were screened by American doctors. Thousands of young Asians were queuing up to come to the United States. The health checkup was very quick. Rathi was eliminated on reason of an eye disease. He then went to a Japanese eye specialist and explained his problem. The Japanese doctor laughed and said he would give him a prescription not for his eye because there was nothing wrong, but how to pass the health checkup. He said it was purely a “law of large number.” The American doctor was screening so many people everyday, he would not remember anybody. The eye doctor advised Rathi to stand in the queue again and again. Rathi got approved on the third day.\n\nRathi and Santosh had third-class tickets in a passenger ship—twenty-eight people herded together in a cabin, lined with five tiers of bunks. The ship arrived in San Francisco in the morning of the fateful day of April 18, 1906—the day the great earthquake and fire devastated the city. From the ship dock they saw the charred remains of a few skyscrapers and the thick black clouds of smoke. That was the first glimpse Rathi and Santosh got of the United States.\n\nThe solitary letter of introduction for a Berkeley professor was now useless—since that campus was destroyed too. Then somebody told them there was a good agricultural college at the University of Illinois. They knew about the big city Chicago, and thought the University could not be that far from it. Of course, it was not “near” either. They took a train from Chicago to Champaign. Before that, they had a inspired thought: they sent a telegraph to the Secretary of the YMCA, Mr. J.H. Miner, to ask him to receive them at the Champaign station. They congratulated themselves on such an inspiration, but nobody was waiting for them at the station. After a few days Rathi and Santosh met Mr. Miner and discovered that the telegraph had been changed to “Two students from Indiana.” The lady at the Chicago telegraph office made the correction herself, doubting the existence of any place called “India.” Indiana being the neighboring state, Mr. Miner did not bother to receive the two students.\n\nIn 1906, there were only a handful of foreign students in the United States, mostly from China, Russia, the Philippines, and Mexico. Many of them did not feel very comfortable—their fellow American students being either too indifferent or too inquisitive. There were less than 100 students from India in the whole of the United States. All the Indian students were called “Hindus,” irrespective of their religion, to differentiate them from Native American Indians.\n\nLet me here mention the role of YMCA. Large numbers of foreign students came from Asia, particularly from China due in no small degree to the missionaries who attended the University of Illinois and belonged to the University YMCA. The very first student from India to the United States, Joguth Chunder Gangooly was sent by the Unitarian Missionary, Reverend Charles Dall from Calcutta. Gangooly arrived Boston on May 24, 1858, almost 150 years back. After a few years of study, Gangooly was ordained as a minister of the New England Unitarian Church.\n\nWhen Rathi and Santosh arrived in the University of Illinois Campus in April of 1906, there was already another student, possibly the very first student from India to study here. He was Sudhindranath Bose who arrived Urbana-Champaign on May 2, 1904.\n\nRathi, with the help of Santosh and Sudhin, got a few more foreign students together and started this Cosmopolitan Club. Assistance came from many quarters, especially from Professor Arthur Seymour. He was a professor of Romance Languages and an advisor to foreign students. There was also a lot of help from his wife, Mrs. Mayce Seymour. Sudhindranath Bose was the first Secretary, Rathi Tagore, the President, and Professor Seymour, the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nAll the publications I have seen on the Cosmopolitan Club at the University of Illinois mention 1907 as the founding year. Let me humbly say that is not right. I have a precise date: October 28, 1906. That was the day the club was organized. My main reference for this is a 1908 article published in the Bengali magazine Prabasi(meaning foreigner), written by Nagendranath Gangooly, another Indian student who joined the University of Illinois in 1907 and who was also a son-in-law of Rabindranath Tagore. Nagendranath also took an active part in the Club and was elected its Assistant Treasurer in 1908.\n\nThe first Cosmopolitan Club on an American University campus was formed in Madison, Wisconsin, March 1903. Then came Cornell in November 1904. The next one was established in Michigan, January 1906. After that came Illinois, October 1906, then Purdue, September 1907, and so on. The year 1907 is often believed to be the originating year because in that year, the Association of the Cosmopolitan Clubs was founded and the Illinois Chapter joined the association. If indeed 1906 is the founding year, that calls for a centennial celebration this year!\n\nOne may wonder why Rathi and Santosh undertook the task of establishing the Cosmopolitan Club. There were already quite a few fraternities on campus. A fraternity brings together men with similar ideals, tastes, and social background. The Cosmopolitan Club brings together people of different nationalities, political ideas, and religions. Rathi and Santosh were among the first batch of students from the experimental school that Rabindranath Tagore established in 1901 at Santiniketan, India. Rabindranath gave a different dimension to nationality by arguing for universal humanity. In a poem in Gitanjali, Tagore expresses, in a beautiful way, his generous tribute to the West and the contributions the East can make:\n\nThe West has today opened its door\n\nThere are treasures for us to take\n\nWe will take, and we will also give.\n\nI am sure that, imbued with his father’s ideas of national unity, world embracing universality, and international brotherhood, Rathi set out to organize the Cosmopolitan Club with the help of other foreign students and Professor and Mrs. Seymour. When foreign students come here, they are not here merely to get degrees; they come with different languages, cultures, customs, and views. As Rabindranath Tagore said, they are here to receive and as well as to give. The Cosmopolitan Annual (1909) had an article, “American and the Foreigner”—it ended with: “It is incredible to think that Americans see men with such diversities of life, creed and customs in their midst without taking advantage of the opportunity to learn something about them, to form a firsthand opinion, and to broaden their minds and views.” In fact, the situation changed very rapidly. So many domestic students wanted to join the Cosmopolitan Clubs that at many places their quotas were limited to 20% of total membership.\n\nA few other important things happened here in 1906. That same year, a small group of University of Illinois faculty members were engaged in organizing the Unitarian Church on campus. Foremost among them were Professor and Mrs. Stephen Forbes. In fact, Mrs. Seymour met Rathi and Santosh at an informal Unitarian reception that Mrs. Forbes organized. In September 1906 the American Unitarian Association sent a young and gifted graduate of the Harvard Divinity School, the Reverend Albert R. Vail, to become the first minister of the newly formed Unitarian Church of Urbana. Reverend Vail personally invited Rathi and Santosh and a few other foreign students to his religious sessions, which included reading from the Koran, the Buddhist Sutras, and Hindu texts. Rathi also acted as a student-pastor at the Unitarian Church.\n\nThrough Rathi and Santosh, Revered Vail, Professor and Mrs. Seymour, and some others in Urbana-Champaign came to know about the great literary works of Rabindranath Tagore. A small group of people from the newly established Cosmopolitan Club and Unitarian Church started meeting every week at the home of Mrs. Mary Kelley to discuss religious matters and Rabindranath Tagore’s work. Thus an informal club, called the Tagore Circle was born. This was long before Rabindranath Tagore himself arrived here on November 1, 1912. To introduce the poet, then quite unknown in the United States, Leslie Carrol Barber, a student at the University of Illinois wrote an article, “Rabindra Nath Tagore” in the December 1912 issue of The Cosmopolitan Student, a publication of the Cosmopolitan Club. And Mayce Seymour published a translation of poet’s three poems along with a photo and a short biography of him in the Illinois Magazine (December 1912), then a monthly publication by undergraduates of the University of Illinois. I think, this is the first publication of Tagore’s poems in any western media, and in which our town and the University can justifiably take pride. During his stay in Urbana, Rabindranath gladly read many of his Gitanjali poems at the Tagore Circle meetings. The audience deeply appreciated the beauty of his poetry and nobility of his character.\n\nThe very first week Rabindranath was in Urbana in November 1912, Reverend Vail invited him to speak at his church on Upanishads. At first Rabindranath declined the invitation since he came to this quiet town mainly to take rest after hectic days in London. However, when he found out that a student from India who knew very little about Upanishad was ready to volunteer, to fulfill his sacred duty to the ancient sages of India, Rabindranath agreed to give the talk. On Sunday, November 10, he gave his first public address in the United States at the Unitarian Church of Urbana, at the corner of Oregon and Mathews. The talk was very well received, and at public demand he also spoke at the church on November 17 and 24. The church community befriended the poet throughout his stay in the University Community. Today, many of you know this Chapel as the Channing-Murray Foundation where we celebrate the Tagore Festival each October.\n\nOn March 19, 1913, the day before Rabindranath left Urbana, the Cosmopolitan Club organized a farewell party where he read an essay. Reverend Albert Vial missed that and on April 1, 1913 in a letter to the poet he “complained” that “It has been one of my great regrets that no one informed me of your reading at the Cosmopolitan Club just before you left, for I was eagerly hoping I might hear that paper. But they say the meeting was arranged on very short notice.” This says a lot about how much Rabindranath became popular in the Urbana-Champaign community. During his several trips to the United States, the poet traveled widely. But, as Harold Hurwitz (1961) stated, “of all the American cities that Tagore visited during his trips to the United States, in none did he stay longer or make more friends than he did in Urbana, Illinois.”\n\n1906 is indeed a very auspicious year—with the establishment of the Cosmopolitan Club (and, related, the beginning of the Unitarian Church and the formation of the Tagore Circle). These institutions, along with YMCA and YWCA, have welcomed the foreign students at this University, and enriched the culture of Champaign-Urbana.\n\nFew of the Cosmopolitan Clubs survived the 20th century. Other than this one, I know of only two: one at the University of Colorado at Boulder, founded in 1924; and the other at the University of Delaware, started only about 35 years ago. Some have changed names, for example, the Cosmopolitan Club at the Southern Oregon University is now called the International Student Association.\n\nWe are so lucky that the Cosmopolitan Club here at the University of Illinois not only survived but also flourished over the century. Over the years the club has made an immense contribution to the spiritual and intellectual culture in Urbana- Champaign, with its already existing superb “agriculture.” Let us all hope, that a hundred years from now, the Club will still be embodying its evergreen motto: “Above all Nations is Humanity.”\n\nReferences\n\nCosmopolitan Annual (1909), Published for the Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs by the Wisconsin International Club, Madison.\n\nRathindranath Tagore (1958), On the Edges of Time, Orient Longmans, Calcutta.\n\nMayce Seymour (1959), “The Golden Time”, Visva-Bharati Quarterly.\n\nHarold Hurwitz (1961), “Rabindranath Tagore in Urbana”, Indian Literature.\n\nHarold Hannah (1973), One Hundred Years of Action: The University of Illinois YMCA 1873-1973.\n\nIngrid Kallick (1992), “Tagore and the Urbana Unitarians 1906-1921”, in Rabindranath Tagore for the 21 st Century, Tagore Center, Urbana.\n\nPrasantakumar Pal (1993), Rabijeebani, Volume 6, Ananda Publishers, Calcutta."
