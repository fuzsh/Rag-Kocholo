        "text": "This is the second of my four-part crash course on pre-modern Armenian history for people who don’t know anything about it from a guy who knows marginally more about it. If you haven’t read the first part yet, where I took 1,000 words just to get to the actual history, you can find it here. The next two parts will cover the thousand or so years between 500 BC and AD 500, give or take a century on either side. This is called the Classical period of Armenian history, a time when Armenians emerge as a unified culture with their own state, assert themselves as a confident, competent player on the world stage, and cross a few thresholds that still affect every Armenian living today.\n\nBut when we last saw Armenia, it was 800 years before Christ and the entire region was under the ruleof the Urartians. Urartian history is fuzzy and full of gaps, but what’s clear is that by the end of the 7th century BC, Urartian power had retreated, leaving behind a political framework for a successor state to pick up. That successor state, emerging around 600 BC, is the Median Empire of Iran. The Medes are one of those classic nomads-to-aristocrats success stories of the Central Asia, a group of freewheeling Iranians who rapidly pillaged their way into respectability while forming a supermassive empire the likes of which had never been seen before. This was not an empire in the more modern sense of one country subjecting another to direct administrative and political control; this simply wasn’t practical in the ancient world. Instead, the Medes, through force or invitation, made other cities and tribes join them as subordinates in a larger federation: besides sending soldiers and taxes to Ecbatana, the vassal states were mostly left to themselves.\n\nAs the empire was too big to rule by direct control, the Medes generally recruited local families to do the daily governing of the provinces, and the former state of Urartu was no exception. They appointed the Orontid, or Yervanduni family to rule Medean Urartu (I’m going to use Yervanduni here, as it’s more commonly used in Armenia). We don’t know a lot about the early Yervandunis, but it’s likely that they were of Urartian and Armenian stock, and in later years they emphasized their ties by blood and marriage to Iran.\n\nThis can get a little complicated, as ancient royal governance can be a little confusing to us moderns, born and raised in democratic nation-states. To the extent that we’re used to seeing royalty, they are considered national avatars of a particular national group; the Queen of England is the face of the English people, the Luxembourgian Duke is the pinnacle of Luxembourgishnessicity, and the King of Sweden is probably obligated to listen to ABBA and sit on Ikea furniture. But this resemblance between royalty and commoner is a new-fangled thing, the result of democratic norms and ideas about who should run a state and why. The ancients, on the other hand, took it for granted that the ruling class was a different species entirely than the peasant rabble, an ancient jet-set with their own international culture and language (usually Greek, Latin, or Persian). So for ancient royalty, blood ties to territories and other dynasties take precedent over maintaining some kind of single ethnic affiliation. This is very common throughout history, with the French rulers of Norman England or the Greek dynasties of ancient Egypt being familiar examples, and it’s helpful to keep in mind going forward as we talk about Armenian kings and aristocrats.\n\nThis makes it hard to talk about the early Yervandunis as “Armenians” in the sense that we understand it. For one thing, we don’t know if people still were even using the word “Armenia” or anything like it to refer to some proto-Armenian population; for another, a number of other ethnic and linguistic groups probably existed in the Armenian plateau that the Yervandunis could have ties with; and finally, it wasn’t particularly strange in Classical Armenia for the royal family to have connections to Iran or other countries, as the Yervandunis did. There are many periods of ancient Armenian history where the ruling family has ties to Persia, or Rome, or Greece, and the language of the court was usually Greek, Aramaic, or Persian—not Armenian, the language of commoners. So we can’t call the Yervandunis Armenian; not yet, anyway.\n\nThe Medes don’t last though, as they fall to the Achaemenid Persians in 549 BC. From their base in Van, the Yervandunis manage to weather the transition and make themselves useful to the Persians, and so keep their position as local rulers. This is a good place to be, as the Achaemenid Empire quickly became the largest, most powerful state in the world, and Armenia enjoyed its semi-independence as a satrapy. There’s no exact modern equivalent for the old satrapy system, but they functioned much like the Medean system: as long as you pay your taxes, provide soldiers, pass on the mail, keep the roads safe, and tell everyone that the Shahanshah (King of Kings) is cool, you’re free to manage your state as you like. This allowed Armenia to grow and consolidate itself over the following centuries.\n\nNot incidentally, we can finally say that around this time, in the late 6th century BC, Armenians—the people, not just the region—officially enter the historical record, with sources in both Persian and Greek specifically discussing Armenian people in the land of Armenia. Modern Armenians are quite proud that the very first mention of Armenians anywhere, the Behistun Inscription (c. 520 BC), describes a revolt against the Persians by a province called Armenia (it was unsuccessful). Our first Greek source is thinner, essentially a geographical note: Hecataeus of Miletus, like the Persians, gives us a place called Armenia where Armenians live.\n\nWhatever the case, by the end of the 400s BC, more Greek sources suggest that a consolidation was taking place. Herodotus describes their trade network with Babylon and speculates that Armenians are related to Phrygians (they’re not). And in the Anabasis of Xenophon (c. 401 BC), Armenians feature prominently as allies of the Persians. It’s worth looking at, and not just because I also love the Anabasis, because Xenophon gives the first detailed description of Armenians. As his army makes its way through Armenian territory on its long march to the Black Sea, Xenophon and his officers stop in an Armenian village, dining with the locals. He tells us that 1) Armenians have their own language, which sounds to him like Persian, and 2) Armenian villagers throw wild parties for their guests. (To old Xenophon’s credit, even two thousand years later, in the period before Armenian was categorized as an Indo-European language, philologists were sure that Armenian was an Iranian language because of its similarities to Persian; and twenty-four centuries later, I can confirm from personal experience that Armenian villagers are still enthusiastically hospitable, and still throw wild parties.) The upshot of Xenophon’s account is that an Armenian people with a distinctive language and culture existed by the 4th century BC. From this point on, Armenians consistently appear in the records of neighboring civilizations.\n\nAnd if you know the history of those neighbors, you can guess how Persian rule in Armenia ends: with the arrival of Alexander III of Macedon and his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC. Alexander didn’t change very much when he was technically the master of Armenia, keeping the Persian imperial administration mostly intact. Armenia merely shifted from rule by one Yervanduni noble who fought against Alexander to another Yervanduni who fought alongside Alexander, and that was it. Things changed even less after Alexander’s death in 323; in the struggle for succession and the carving up of the empire, Armenia fell under the control of the Seleucids, who Hellenized the Armenian nobility, introducing them to Greek language, culture, and institutions, which would influence Armenia for many centuries (weirdly enough, their greatest legacy today is, uh, Chanukkah). But politically, the early Seleucids of the 200s BC were overextended, and the Yervandunis were de facto independent, even going so far as mint their own coinage.\n\nThis didn’t last. In 212 BC, the Seleucids decided to tighten the reins on Armenia, divide the country into two provinces, and remove the Yervandunis from power. The Armenian royal families were not pleased, and by 190 BC, with the Seleucids weakened by war with Rome, they were able to successfully revolt under the leadership of Artaxiad, a nobleman claiming descent from the Yervandunis. He declared himself king of an independent Armenia one year later, starting Armenia’s second great dynasty. Goodbye, Yervandunis; hello, Artaxiads.\n\nThe Artaxiads got a lot done during their time in power: they successfully integrated several Armenian-speaking territories with the kingdom, built the new capital city of Artashat (according to Plutarch, with help from Hannibal Barca–yes, that Hannibal), and oversaw the development of Armenia into a strong, Hellenistic state.\n\nMost important was the reign of Tigran II “The Great,” easily the most famous and admired of all Armenian kings. Part of this was good timing: his rule, 95-55 BC, coincided with periods where the Romans and Parthian Persians were too busy with internal disputes and invasions in their much-larger empires, leaving them distracted while Tigran pressed his advantage. Armenian wars against the Parthians and Seleucids were successful, granting Armenia large swathes of Syria and Mesopotamia. Their incorporation meant that Armenia now linked the Mediterranean and Caspian seas, bringing Armenia to its greatest geographical extent ever. In 83 BC, he established the city of Tigranakert, a cosmopolitan, Hellenstic capital famed for its high culture and polyglot residents.\n\nTigran also allied himself by marriage to Mithridates of Pontus; partnership with the self-appointed scourge of Rome, who was always getting into unresolved little wars with the Romans, might have seemed like a good idea at the time, but the particular Roman-Pontic War that Tigran got dragged into by his new father-in-law turned out to be the last one, and the worst. Even with the advantage of numbers and terrain, the forces of Tigran the Great were defeated by the invading forces of Pompey the Great, and Armenia was forced to abandon its new territories and submit to Roman control. The great Sea-to-Sea Empire, whose maps adorn the wall of every Armenian school, only lasted a few years. Tigran died in 55 BC, and with him the hope of an independent Armenian kingdom for many centuries.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they weren’t an interesting time. Stay tuned for my next post on Armenian history, which will cover such important questions as: which major world religion did Armenia convert to? Which one of Cleopatra’s boyfriends relied on her to sack Tigranocerta? When the hell was Movses Khorenatsi born, anyway? Thanks for reading, and stay tuned."
