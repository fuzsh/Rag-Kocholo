        "text": "Sacramento, CA – In a letter to the White House, Senator Anthony J. Portantino (D – Burbank), Senator Scott Wilk, and other members of the Select Committee on California, Armenia, and Artsakh Mutual Trade, Art, and Cultural Exchange, urged the Biden administration to increase its support for the forcibly displaced indigenous Armenians of Artsakh and to demand the immediate release Armenian POWs, civilians, and government leaders illegally held captive by Azerbaijan.\n\nDear Friends and Neighbors,\n\nClimate change is creating warmer and dryer seasons - increasing the frequency and destructive capability of wildfires. Delayed winter rains only contribute to this problem. Recent rains have produced a high volume of rainfall over brief periods. The resulting super bloom of vegetation then dries out - thereby creating potential fuel sources for wildfires to thrive.\n\nSacramento, CA – Senate Bill 1128, a measure authored by Senator Anthony J. Portantino (D – Burbank) to combat human and sex trafficking and protect California’s youth from exploitation, was approved by the Assembly Public Safety Committee. Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto is a sponsor of SB 1128, and the measure was unanimously supported by the Los Angeles City Council.\n\nSacramento, California – Senate Bill 480, authored by Senator Anthony J. Portantino (D – Burbank), passed the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee. The measure is aimed at better preparing students for the workforce by expanding apprenticeship programs and creating more collaboration between schools and businesses."
