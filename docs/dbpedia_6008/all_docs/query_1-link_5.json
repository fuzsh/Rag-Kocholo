        "text": "Â p32Â ChapterÂ VI\n\nThe Country of Hayasa-Khayasha\n\nAÂ Federation in future Armenia\n\nHittite inscriptions deciphered by E.Â Forrer testify to the existence of a mountain country, the Hayasa, lying around the Lake of Van. According to P.Â Kretschmer, Hayasa or Khayasa, identified with Haik, Hayk or Hark, was inhabited before the coming of Armens. The suffix sa of Hayasa corresponds to the stan (habitat) derivative of Hayastan (Armenia). The name of that pre-Armen people may be found in the writings of Greek historians, Choi, Chai or Chaoi, the ch being sounded like the Greek letterÂ Î§. The identity of the names Hayk and Hayasa had been asserted by KarlÂ Rot, long before Kretschmer. As to the form Hayasa-Azzi in the inscriptions, A.Â Goetze thinks the name Azzi represents the Alzi or Alzini of the Assyrian and Urartean inscriptions.\n\nThe cuneiform tablets of Boghaz Keuy have preserved the names of four successive kings who ruled the \"Quasi-republican organization\" â as Professor Eugene Cavaignac calls it â of Hayasa. They were Karannish, Mariyash, Hukkanash, and Anniyash, the four covering a period of 55Â years, fromÂ 1390 toÂ 1335Â B.C. The first-named of these kings made incursions into the Hatti or Hittite empire, which were checked by the Emperor Dudhaliyash and his successor, Subbiluliuma. Mariyash, the next king of Hayasa, who had married a Hittite princess, was punished with death because of his breach of matrimonial contract. Hukkanash, the third in the line, also married a Hittite princess, the sister of the Emperor Subbiluliuma.\n\nPalace ethics\n\nThe marriage treaty of this couple contained some interesting stipulations peculiar to the time. \"My sister, whom IÂ gave you in Â p34Â marriage,\" says the Hatti ruler, \"has sisters; through your marriage, they now become your relatives. Well, there is a law in the land of the Hatti. Do not approach sisters, your sisters-inâlaw or your cousins; that is not permitted. In Hatti Land, whosoever commits such an act does not live; he dies.Â .Â .Â . In your country, you do not hesitate to marry your own sister, sister-inâlaw or cousin, because you are not civilized. Such an act cannot be permitted in Hatti.\"\n\nDespite these restrictions imposed upon Hukkanash, he was no meek and submissive brother-inâlaw in political and military affairs. As a condition for the release of the thousands of Hittite prisoners held in his domain, he demanded first the return home of the Hayasan prisoners confined at Hatti. The Hittite Empire had been subject to constant harassment by its eastern neighbors, from the basin of the upper Euphrates to Aravanna (Erevan of today) and Tebruzzi (Tabriz). One of the most important of these enemies crouched on its eastern border was the kingdom of Hayasa-Azzi.\n\nHittite-Hayasa Wars\n\n\"Mursil, the Hittite Emperor,\" saysÂº Cavaignac, speaking of that period, \"was busy in the wars waged against Azzi or Hayasa, which were as bitter as those waged against Arzava (Western Cilicia). About the beginning of Subbiluliuma's reign, that country (Hayasa-Azzi) was subject to Hittite influence, but won its freedom later on. Annyash, the King of Hayasa, had sacked several districts and refused to release the prisoners taken. He had created a political union of the tribes of Armenia, and organized a kingdom which extended from the River Iris (Yeshil-Irmak) to the Lake of Van.\"\n\nHayasa's good fortune did not continue long, however. The Hittite Mursil​1Â II, having consulted the oracles, invaded Hayasa inÂ 1340Â B.C. In the following spring he crossed the Euphrates and re-organized his army at Ingalova â Angegh, Angl â which, about ten centuries later, was to become the treasure-house and burial-place of the Armenian kings of the Arshakuni-Arsacid dynasty. One of the captured fortresses lay on the west side of the Lake of Van.\n\nThe Annals of Mursil thus describe these campaigns:â\n\nDecline of Hayasa\n\nHayasa as a fighting power was practically eliminated by the expedition of MursilÂ II inÂ 1340Â B.C. But after Mursil's premature death inÂ 1320Â B.C., the Hatti empire suffered a series of shocks. His elder brother Arvandas (Erouand) had also died young. AÂ natural phenomenon, the eclipse of the sun, had terrified the people. AÂ dreadful epidemic of some sort took a vast number of lives, including that of the Queen. The population of the capital was decimated to such a degree as to require the forced immigration of new inhabitants from adjoining countries. Taking advantage of the ensuing debacle, Mursil's nephew, Armaâuâas (Aramais?), contested against the heir-apparent for the succession to the crown. Still more serious was the menace of the external enemies of the land, especially Â p36Â those of the North and East, who devastated the country in revenge for Mursil's conquests. AÂ record exists of the incursion of the Kaskas or Kaskians, who crossed the Halys River with 800Â chariots and advanced as far as the capital, which they plundered. The King was compelled to remove the idols and the paraphernalia for the worship of the dead to a safer place.\n\nThe Kaskas â whose home J.Â Garstang places in Armenia âÂ attacked by way of Amasia. Leonard King describes them as an \"unruly people\" living between the Euphrates and the Lake of Van, and a constant menace to the Hatti. \"No Hatti King,\" says he, \"was able to establish his power there permanently.\" It may therefore be safely assumed that Hayasa still exerted its influence. In any case, however, the days of the Hattite hegemony were numbered. The Assyrians forged ahead and gradually spread their domination over southern and western Armenia.\n\nThe origin of the Hay element is still a mystery, but the existence of the land and people of Hayasa-Azzi as a factor in relation to the Hatti covers a long period, beginning \"before the expansion of the Hittite empire towards Syria,\" according to Professor A.Â Goetze. Several prominent authorities agree in pla­cing Azzi to the north of Isuva. Others see Hayasa and Azzi as identical.\n\nFall of Hittite Empire\n\nThe Hittite or Hatti Empire was overthrown 140Â years after Mursil's campaign in Hayasa. InÂ 1180Â B.C., Indo-European tribes, crossing the Dardanelles and the Bosporus, overran Asia Minor, destroying aÂ number of States and cities, among which was Hattushash, the Hittite capital. One of the three greatest tribes of the invasion was that known as the Armens. In the words of Fr.Â Hrozny, \"the Hittite Empire fell under the attack of the 'sea peoples,' and also of the Thracians, Phrygians and Armens.\" Other scholars coincide in Hrozny's opinion that the \"Phrygians and Armens became the heirs of the power­ful Hittite Empire.\"\n\nThe Author's Note:"
