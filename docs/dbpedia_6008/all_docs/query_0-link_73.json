Click here to subscribe.\n\nAs part of our ongoing series of historical video-maps, we present: ‘Every Year in the History of Armenia,’ from YouTube creator Kayra Atakan.\n\nBeginning in 1500 BC with the Hayasa-Azzi confederation and continuing until present day, the following video tracks the changing borders and migrations of Armenia and the Armenian people. Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the Biblical mountains of Ararat and has found itself sandwiched between, and absorbed by, many of the most powerful empires throughout history: the Romans, the Parthians, the Mongols, the Persians, the Rashidun Caliphate, the Ottomans, the Soviets, and others.\n\nNow a sovereign nation and a constitutional democracy, Armenia is in the midst of widespread fighting with neighboring Azerbaijan over a break-away region that ended up as part of Azerbaijan after the fall of the Soviet Union despite being ethnically Armenian. The conflict is believed to have been re-ignited by a coordinated Azerbaijan attack aimed at reasserting control over the breakaway region.\n\nTo see other interesting historical maps check out:\n\nThe History of the Greeks\n\nEvery Year of the Roman Empire\n\nEvery Other Day of the Napoleonic Wars\n\nEvery Day of World War I\n\nEvery Day of World War II\n\nEveryday of World War II in the Pacific\n\nThe History of the World Every Year\n\nThe Five Largest Cities Throughout History\n\nEvery Major Plague Epidemic in History\n\nThe Evolution of Modern Government\n\nThe Rise of Religions Throughout History\n\nThe History of Communism Since 1850\n\nThe History of Urbanization\n\nThe History of South America\n\nHow the World Got Obese\n\nThe History of North America\n\nThe History of Africa\n\nThe History of China Every Year\n\nEvery Nuclear Explosion in History\n\nEvery Year in The History of the Ottoman Empire\n\nThe History of the Middle East\n\nThe Loss of Native American Lands Within the US Every Year\n\nEvery Ruler in Europe Since 400 BC\n\nEvery Day of the Korean War\n\nThe Results of Every US Presidential Election in History\n\nEvery Week of the American War of Independence\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Mongol Empire\n\nThe Population of Every Civilization in Europe Every Year Since 400 BC\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the French Empire\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the British Empire\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire\n\nThe History of the Reconquista\n\nThe History of South Asia\n\nThe Great Turkish War\n\nEvery Other Day of the Russian Civil War\n\nEvery Year in the History of the British Isles\n\nEvery European Country’s Maximum Extent\n\nThe French Invasion of Mexico\n\nEvery Ruler of Russia and Its Borders Since 880 AD\n\nThe Great Northern War\n\nThe Ancient History of the Middle East, Every Year\n\nThe Conquests of Alexander the Great, Every Month\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Inca Empire, Every Year\n\nEvery Month of the Hundred Years’ War\n\nAncient Mesoamerica, Every Year\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Hapsburg Dynasty\n\nEvery Year in the History of Scandinavia\n\nThe Largest Cities in North America Since 900 BC\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Japanese Empire\n\n4,500 Years of Battles in One Time-Lapse Map\n\nEvery Year and Ruler in the History of Egypt\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Italian Maritime Republics\n\nEvery Day of the English Civil War\n\nThe Five Largest Cities in Europe Every Year Since 1200 AD\n\nEvery Single Year in the History of Civilization in Asia\n\nEvery Year in the History of England\n\nThe Human Population for the Last 2000 Years\n\nThe Largest Empires in History\n\nEvery Other Day of the American Revolution\n\nThe History of Coins & Currency Until 1500 AD\n\nThe History of Coins & Currency – 1500 to 2019 AD\n\nThe Reconquest of Rome\n\nEvery Ten Days of the Chinese Warlord Era\n\nThe History of the EU\n\nEvery Day of the Mexican-American War\n\nThe Spread of Buddhism from 500 BC to 1200 AD\n\nThe History of the British Isles Since 100 BCE\n\nThe Spread of the Black Death\n\nUr, Babylon, and the Ancient Middle East – Every Year\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Portuguese Empire"
