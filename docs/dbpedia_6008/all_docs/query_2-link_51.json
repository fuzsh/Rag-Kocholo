        "text": "Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. One can admire an ancient inscription engraved on the stone in 782 BC, referring to the construction of a fortress called Erebuni, built by King Arghisti I, which gave its name to the city.\n\nCapital of Armenia, located on the river Razdan, the city of Yerevan is the major economic, administrative, and scientific hub of the country. It was mentioned for the first time in the sixth century BC, yet it only became the administrative center of Eastern Armenia in 1440, before passing into the hands of the Russian Empire in 1828. Because of the forced migrations in the history of the Armenian people, the city is not only the capital of the country, but also the capital for all Armenians scattered around the world. Since Armenia obtained its independence, the city of Yerevan has freed itself from the symbols of the communist regime. Names of major avenues and squares were renamed, while the statues of the heroes of the Soviet Union were taken down.\n\nThe city has evolved through several civilizations over the centuries. Yerevan houses the Matenadaran foundation, which is one of the oldest and richest libraries in the world, recognized by the “Memory of the World” UNESCO program."
