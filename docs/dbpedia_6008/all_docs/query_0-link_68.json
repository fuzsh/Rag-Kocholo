        "text": "Administrative division of Armenia\n\nDuring History\n\nEdic Baghdasarian\n\nFrom his book` History of the Armenian army\n\nThere is not much information about adminis-trative division of prehistoric Armenian highland at the time of Aratta, Mitani, Hayasa-Azzi, Nairi, Uratri, Arme-Shupria, Urartu (Van kingdom).\n\nAratta\n\nHayassa, Mitanni\n\nKingdom of Van (Urartu)\n\nAchaemenid king Darius (522-484 BC) managed 5 battles in 551-550 BC agains Armenians to occupy Armenia. At that time Iran was divided into 20 Satrapies and Armenia was included in two of them 13th and 18th. Satrapy 13 included eastern regions Armenia and Hayasa-Azzi and other small areas. Armenia stretched to upper Tigris and Aradsani areas, corresponding with Sophene and Aghdzenik provinces, it is possible that many other small regions were also included in Armenia, beside them, regions near Pontus sea (Black sea) were also covered by Satrapy 13.\n\nYervandunian (Orontid) Armenia\n\nAccording to Herodotus (484-425 BC) satrapy\n\n18 consisted of landas of Matieni, Saspiri and Alarodii (Armenians ).\n\nAnabasis of Xenophon (430-354 BC) is the most important source for Armenia under Achaemenid rule. His information relates to The March of the Ten Thousand and the route through Armenia, according to it, we can have some information about geography of Armenian at that time. According to him Armenia was divided into two Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia Satrapies for administration included in Achaemenid Persia.\n\nRoute of Cyrus the Younger, Xenophon and the Ten Thousand.\n\nUnfortunately He does not describe the exact borders of Armenia.\n\nAchaemenid Empire\n\nDuring Seleucid reign (312-63 BC) only a portion of Armenia was under their rule. At that time Armenia consisted of three major parts: Armenia Minor (Lesser Armenia), Sophene and Armenia Major (Greater Armenia). Northern parts of Armenia Minor and Armenia Major were independent and ruled by regional kings.\n\nSeleucid Empire\n\nAfter the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC between Romans, led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio and the Roman ally Eumenes II of Pergamum, and the army of Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, Artashes and Zareh governors of Greater Armenia and Shphene, respectively, declare independence and established Armenian kingdoms, while Armenia Minor had already achieved independence. We get clearer idiea about the territories the Armenian kings were able to take under their control through information reached us by Strabo.According to him King Artashes had captured Caspian land (Paytakaran), Vaspurakan, (Strabo mentions Basoropeda), Pavnitis (?), which is considered to be Syunik, Tayk, Khordzene, Gugark, (Gogarine), Karin (Karenties), Derjan (Derksene), and Tmorik . Strabo also gives us description of mountains, plateaus, valleys, etc .\n\nZareh had captured lands at Antitaurus and Yegeghiats canton .\n\nSo Main Armenia (East of Euphrates) i.e Greater Armenia and Sophene at the time of Artashes I (189-160 BC) and Zareh consisted of Paytakaran, Syunik, Vaspurakan, Ayrarat. Gugark, Tayk, most of Upper Armenia, Turuberan, Fourth Armenia, Aghdzenik, Mogk, most of Kortchayk, Utik and Artsakh, which means 14 out of 15 province of future Arshakunian Armenia. Strabo mentions that the population of all captured lands spoke in Armenian .\n\nIn Tte same time (2nd century BC), Lesser Armenia was enlarged west of Euphrates, which occupied west of mountains Paryadres (Parkharian) and noth-eastern shores of Pontus.\n\nThe largest of all three Armenian kingdoms was the Greater Armenia under Artashes I.\n\nHistorians especially have reported more details starting from Tigran II the Great (95-55 BC) of Artashesian Dynasty. After ascending the thrown, he liberated 70 valleys from Persia. They were a part of Armenia at the time of Artashes I and were surrendered to Persians as a price to get Tigrans freedom. Tigran had been a hostage until the age of 45 at the court of King Mithridates II of Parthia after the Armenian defeat in 105 BC. According to many researches, this region corresmoded with future Parskahayk province.\n\nUnder his reign, the Armenian kingdom expanded beyond its traditional boundaries, allowing Tigranes to claim the title Great King, and involving Armenia in many battles against opponents such as the Parthian and Seleucid empires, and the Roman Republic.\n\nThen he annexed (in 94 BC) Sophene, all lands except Pontus until Cappadocia. These lands later on became a part of Armenia, but other lands such as Aturpatkan (Iranian Azerbaijan), Great Medes, Adiabene, Osroyene, Migdonia, Commagene, Assyria and some other locations were a part of Armenia for short time until his battle against Pompey (65 BC), So political borders of Armenia matched approximately with Armenian Highland. So when using the term Ancient Armenia, we should not consider the Armenian Empire borders created by Tigran the Great, but we should consider the borders of Armenia as Greater Armenia at the time of Artashes plus the lands joined by Tigran II (Sophene, Eastern part of Lesser Armenia, Kortduk and Shirakan, which was called Parskahayk at a later time).\n\nAbout Administrative division of Armenia we do not have much information. Academician H. Manandian mentions about Feudal system for administration of the country[10]. Roman geographer Pliny the Elder (Gaius Plinius Secundus 23-79 AD) mentions that at his time Armenia was devided into 120 regions, which he called them Strategia. Artashesian kingdom had two capitals: Artashat built bt Artashes I (About 166 BC) and Tigranakert built by Tigran the Great (About 77 BC).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, according to Ashkharatsuyts of Anania Shirakatsi, Greater Armenia was devided into 15 provinces[12].\n\nBorders of Armenia reached its maximum level at the time of Armenian Arshagunian (Arsacid) kingdom (66-428 AD).According to Shirakatsi 15 provinces of Greater Armenia had borders with Assyria, Georgia, Caspian sea, Aturpatkan (Iranian Azerbaijan) and Caucasian Albania.\n\n15 provinces of Greater Armenia (Arsacid Armenia).\n\nArshagunian Armenia had two capitals: Artashat and Vagharshapat.\n\nArmenian political borders remained almost unchanges until 387, when during the ByzantineSasanian wars, Armenia was ultimately partitioned into Byzantine Armenia (Western) and Persian Armenia (Eastern). According to this big change border provinces of Sophene, Aghdzenik, Korduk, Parskahayk, Paytakaran, Artsakh, Utik and Gugark were separated from Armenia and central provinces were devided between two mentioned powers.\n\nEastern Armenia (Persian)\n\nAbout 4/5 was under Persian (Eastern Armenia) and 1/5 under Roman (Weatern Armenia) influence. The border between these two was passing through Nisibin-Karin line.\n\nWestern Armenia (Roman)\n\nWestern Armenia\n\nThis portion of Armenia had three partition from administrative point of view:\n\n1-Autonomous princedoms or Satrapy Armenia: It was bounded by lower Aradsani and upper portion of Western Tigris and consisted of 6 Armenian princedoms: Great Sophene, Angeghtun, Andzit, Shahuniats Sophene, Hashtiank, Balahovit. Armenian princes had only internal autonomy.\n\n2-Inner Armenia (Armenia Inferior), It was also called Great Armenia by Romans and Byzantines and consisted of 11 cantons: Khordzian, Paghnatun, Mundzur, Daranaghi, Yegeghiats, Manabaghi, Derjan, Karin, Shaghgomk, Sper, Aryuds. Inner Armenia was occupied by Romans at 387. Inner Armenia corresponded with Upper Armenia .\n\n3-Lesser Armenia.It corresponded with ancient Hayasa. During collapse of the Seleucids, Lesser Armenia of Armenia Minor was the first to declare independence and establish Armenian kingdom. There were 5 regions in Armenia Minor: Orbalisen, Aytughan, Ayretik, Orsen, Orbisen. After second half of the 4th century (379-395 )Armenia Minor was divided into two provinces: First Armenia (Armenia Prima) and Second Armenia (Armenia Secunda).\n\nThe highest authority in Armenia Inferior was called Comes Armeniae. In the satrapy Armenia Armenian princes were ruling without any higher state officials.\n\nLesser Armenia was autonomous in internal affairs but for foreign affairs was dependent on the Roman Emperor.\n\nIn 535 and 536, the emperor Justinian I reorganized the provincial administration, and Armenian lands were divided into four provinces: First Armenia, Second Armenia, Third Armenia and Fourth Armenia.\n\nThe borders of the Byzantine part of Armenia were expanded in 591 into Parskahayk of Persarmenia, but the region was the focus of decades of warfare between the Byzantines and the Persians (the Byzantine-Sassanid Wars) until the Arab conquest of Armenia in 640.\n\nEastern Armenia\n\nEastenArmenia was also called of Marzpanate Armenia or Persian Armenia, although these latter names were not acceptable, since the name of a country can not be taken from the Rulers titles. After Armenia partitioned in 387, Western portion was annexed to Roman epire, but Eastern Armenia preserved its kingdom until 428.\n\nIn the 6th century Sasanian Iran was devided into four regions or Kustaks or Kusts: eastern (Kusti Khorasan), western (Kusti Korbaran), northern (Kapkoh) and southern (Kusti Nemroj). Each Kustak had two authorities one was called Padgospan for administration and the second one was Sepahbod or army general or commander for military affairs. Armenia, Aturpatkan, Georgia and Albania were included in the northern kustak. Each kustak was also divided to smaller administrative areas called Shahr or Marz or province. Northern kustak had 13 provinces. Marspan or governor of Armenia was appointed by Sasanian kings, there were also two high-rank officials Sparapet or commander-in-chief of army and Hazaapet (Hezarbod) was responsible for economy, culture and internal development.\n\nAccording to treaty of Nvarsak in 484 between Vahan Mamikonian and Persian court, Marzpanate Armenia was called Tanutirakan country and Marzpan was Armenian Tanuter.\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\nArmenia (527-591)\n\n1-Armenian Marzpanate\n\n2-Roman Armenia\n\n3-Georigian marzpanate\n\n4-Albanian Marzpanate\n\nTeritorry of Eastern Armenia under the rule of Marzpan (429-640) was significantly smaller than Arshakuni eras Armenia. These regions were taken off from Armenia: Gugark, Utik, Artsakh, Paytakaran, Parskahayk, Kortchek, and Aghdzenik.\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nArmenia just before Arab invasion\n\n1-First Armenia,2-Second Armenia,3-Third Armenia, 4-Fourth Armenia, 5-Armenian Marzpanate, 6-Albanian Marzpanate, 7-Georgian Marzpamnate\n\nTwo superpowers of the time, Roman and Persian Empires, partitioned Armenia for the second time in 591, from that time until Arab invasions significant changes did not happen in the former Eastern Armenias internal life and affairs.\n\nArmenia in 7-9 centuries\n\nThree destructive Arab invasions to Armenia happened in 640-650., despite of that, Armenia could preserve internal independence until the end of the 7th century, while was enjoying full independence from time to time. But soon after, Arabic Caliphate made fundamental changes to political, administrative and military system of Armenia, According to them, Armenia, Georgia and Albania were included in one administrative unit called Arminiya (Arabic pronunciation of Armenia), which bordered with Cacausian mounts to the north, Eastern Tigris to the south, Caspian sea to the east and Black sea, Tchorokh and Euphrates to the west.\n\nArminiya in. 750-885\n\nArminiya population consisted of Armenians, Georgians, Albanians, and some other ethnicities. It was divided into four administrative areas:\n\n1-Albania, 2-Georgia, 3and 4-Armenia. Dvin was capital of caliphs appointed Emir (Armenians called him Vostican) in Armaniya. That is why Armenia under the rule of Arabs was also called Vostikanate or Ostikanate of Arminiya.\n\nDuring 7-9 centuries Western Armenia remained as it was under Byzantine empire, but Arabs took major part of Fourth Armenia and Karin canton, the latter was soon taken back by Byzantines.\n\nArmenia in 9-11 centuries\n\nArmenia achieved its full independence from Arabic caliphate in 885 by Armenian Bagratuni dynasty. At that time there were many Armenian princedoms under princes or great feudal-lords (with their own administration, army, etc). But very soon in 908 the integrity of Bagratuni kingdom was changed and some subordinate states were formed under Bagratuni Kingdom. The main part of the kingdom was that of Ani-Shirak (885-1045). These states were: kingdoms of Vaspurakan (Ardseruni dynasty 908-1021), Vanand or Kars (Bagratuni, 963-1065), Syunik or Kapan (970-1170), Tashir-Dzoraget or Lori (Korikian, 966-1113), Tayk (962-1001), Andzevatiats princedom, Mogk,Taron (Bagratuni, 826-967), Artsakh (5-10 cc.), Albanian princedom, Hamshen princedom, Georgian princedom (Bagratuni, 9-19 cc.), Khachen princedom (10-16 cc.), Tchighb princedom, Kakhet, Kegharj,, Samtskhe, Liparit-Baghvash, Abkhazia, Kaysid emirate, Aghdzenik emirate, etc . Bagratuni kingdom collapsed in 1045.\n\nArmenia in 11-13 centuries\n\nDuring this period Armenian administrative-political system went under fundamental changes. For a short period (1045-71) Armenia was under Byzantine rule, despite, some of formerly mentioned states were able to preserve their existence (Taron, Vaspurakan, Ani, etc).\n\nThree destructive Seljuk invasions in 1043, 1049 and 1054 were catastrophic, hundreds of villages and tens of cities wre destroyed.\n\nZakarian Armenia was an Armenian principality between 1201 and 1360, ruled by the Zakarian dynasty. The city of Ani was the capital of the princedom. The Zakarids were vassals to the Kingdom of Georgia (Bagratuni Georgia) until 1236 when they became vassals to the Mongol Empire.Their princedom was divided into two portions, one was under the rule of Zakare, the other one under his brother Ivane. Zakarian dynasty had also their vassal pricedoms (Vachutian, Orbelian, Proshian, Dopian). Their descendants continued to hold Ani until the 1330s, when they lost it to a succession of Turkish dynasties, including the Kara-Koyunlu, who made Ani their capital.\n\nArmenia 1080-1236\n\nZakarian Armenia 1201-1360\n\nArmenia in 13-15 centuries\n\nThe first Mongol invasion to Caucasus happened in 1220-21, but they encountered strong resistance in 1221 at Shamkor (Battle of Khunan) and were not inclined to conquer the Caucasus at that time and turned back south to Hamadan. 14 years later, for the second time they invaded Northern Armenia, and during 1242-1243 occupied the whole area, and in 1242-43 invaded and occupied Southern and Western Armenia. Consecuences of these invasions were mass murder of population, destruction of settlements, emprisoning, plunder, etc.\n\nMongol Empire before 1259\n\nMongol empire was divided into uluses at the time of Momgke khan (1251-1259), Armenia was included in the fourth ulus (1236-1335).\n\nArmenia in Mongol empire\n\nArmenian semi-independent and autonomous states gradually lost their political power and influence under Mongol administration. The most stable among them, at the time of Hulagu ilkhanate until invasions of Tamelane, was princedom of Orbelian dynasty in Syunik. Mongol khans were assisting Orbelians against Zakarian rulers. After Syunik other Armenian relatively enduring princedoms were Ardsrunis of Mahkanaberd, small principalities of Sasun and Aghtamar. Other princedoms such as Zakarians, Vachutians, Vahramians, Dopians, Proshians, Jalalians (a branch of Orbelians) lost their previous importance and political position at the second half of 13th century.\n\n2\n\n10\n\n8\n\n7\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n5\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1-Zakarian, 2-Orbelian, 3-Vakhtangian, Jalalian, Shirjanshank, 4-Dopian, 5-Kyurikian, 6-Ardseruni, 7-Vahramian, 8-Ardserunik, 9- Vachutian, 10-Proshian\n\nThe Armenian kingdom and principalities of Cilicia (1080-1515) was formed by refugees and migrants from Greater Armenia. Located outside of the Armenian Highland and distinct from the Armenian Kingdom of antiquity, it was centered in the Cilicia region northwest of the Gulf of Alexandretta, which was called Armenian Gulf at its time.\n\nArmenian kingdom of Cilicia\n\nTamerlane (1370-1405) invaded Armenia in 1386, 1387, 1394 and 1400, destroyed settlements, murdered population and plundered, etc. He created a vast empire from Aral lake to Persian gulf and from Pamir to Mediterranean shores at Asian Minor. In 1395-96 almost whole Armenian highland and local emirates were under his rule. Like Mongols, he devided his empire into vast portions and appointed his reliable persons as governors of these lands. According to new division, Armenia and Aturpatkan (Iranian Azerbaijan, south of Araks river) were included in one administrative unit, the governor was called great Emir. Tamerlane preserved the Armenian Orbelians (Syunik), Dopians (Dsar), Proshians (Vayots-Dzor, Sahapunik), principlalities of Artsakh, Gegharkunik, etc.\n\nArmenia, late 14 early 16 centuries\n\nAfter death of Tamerlane (Timur) his empire was divided by local emirs and lords, before that time new foreigners, Kara-Koyunlu (1375-1469) and Ak-Koyunlu (1378-1501) tribes had already established in the area and soon took power in Iran and Caucasus and neighboring areas.\n\nKara Koyunlu state 1407-1469\n\nAk-Koyunlu Jahanshah (1437-1467) ruled over large portion of Armenia, in order to confront with his Persian and Turkish enemies, he supported local Armenian principalities which could preserve their existence, So he granted special privilege to them as Meliks.Armenian meliks were mainly residing in Geghama land, Vayots-Dzor, Syunik, Artsakh and Gugark. Such principalities existed also in Vaspurakan, Reshtunik and Mogk.Only principality of Aghtamar has some power at southern Armenia. Jahanshah made Ararat a separate province with Yerevan capital.\n\nAk-Koyulu state achieved its maximum enlargement at the time of Uzun Hasan (1467-1477), at that time his territory stretched from Halis to heart of Persia included parts of Middle East and Near East. Not very long after his death, his state collapse and new powers emerged, Ottoman Sultanate and Safavid Persia, that made Armenia their battlefield.\n\nAk-Koyunlu state\n\nArmenia in 16-18 centuries\n\nAfter collapse of Ak-Koyunlu power, two large states, Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Persia were established in two portions of Armenia in the 16th century. These superpowers of the region had a few battles. These battles ended in 1555 with a peace treaty, according to it Armenia was divided between them for the first time, Large part of Vaspurakan, Bayazit and Alashkert regions were passed to the Turks, though Turkey had already occupied other provinces of Western Armenia, beside Armenia, Turks occupied also Western Georgia. The peace did not last long and war was restarted in 70s and ended in 1639.

By the summer of 1989 the Armenian-populated areas of the NKAO were under blockade by Azerbaijan as a response to Armenia's blockade against Nakhichevan, cutting road and rail links to the outside world. On July 12 the Nagorno-Karabakh AO Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan. Soviet authorities in Moscow then placed the region under its direct rule, installing a special commission to govern the region.
