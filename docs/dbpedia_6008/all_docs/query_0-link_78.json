        "text": "Armenians were in an inferior position in Urartu; their language was more of a substratum [which became a superstratum later on] under Urartian, and consecutively, Armenian has a considerable amount of Urartian glossary. Urartians were not Proto-Armenian; they were not Indo-European at all. An Armenian dynasty, Orontid, succeeded Urartu and then the land began to be called Armenia alternatively. ( of which Armenia is not even Armenian word;do you have any idea why they began calling it Armenia? = they: Persians, Assyrians etc.)\n\nWell i've been reading up on it and it is not certain wether the land was called after the people or the people after the land.\n\nAs Ar-or Men/Man- sounding and Ha-, or Hay-sounding toponyms and ethnonyms have been dancing around the map of the broader Middle East since almost the very beginning of history until recently. From Ararat and the Mesopotamian god Ha-ia, the Sumerian Enki, to Aryans, Armenians and Iran.\n\nThere's Akkadian Arm√¢num or Armani, mentioned in 2200BC as Sargon's grandson adds the city or region to his domain. There is no consensus as to wether Armanum refers to the Armenian highland or the city of Aleppo. As it is mentioned in one breath together with the Syrian city of Ebla, but also with Subartu, which generally meant \"north\", the region of Assyria, to the Akkadians.\n\nA little later appear the Hayasa-Azzi in Hittite texts from 1500BC onwards. They form a confederation in the region of Lake Van which ultimately get destroyed by the Hittites around 1300BC. It is possible Armenians are a Phrygian group who moved into the region, as the ancient Greek historians wrote.\n\nThen there's the biblical Minni as mentioned by Toethmosis III of Egypt in 1446BC, together with Ararat and Ashkenaz (likely Scythians). Believed to correspond with Assyrian Minnai or Mannai, Minni was the kingdom of the Manneans, who probaly spoke a Hurri-Urartian language and were based around Lake Urmia from the 9th century BC until they fell in the years of the end of the Neo Assyrian empire and the start of the Medes rise to power in the 610s-620s BC.\n\nArmenians may not be linguistically related to the Urartians, but genetically and culturally, Armenians are the descendants of the Urartians. Armenian is a mix language, always borrowed words form hegemonic regional powers; heavily persianized, some greek, some latin, some french, much Turkish, some other things here and there. Armenians have an Urartian substratum indicating some sort of connection. If no connection existed, what would explain for some, or even most [some words in Armenian cannot be decisively traced], of the Urartian Hurrian words in the Armenian language? Armenian also has too many constants for an Indo-European language. I have a feeling, Armenian is an Indo-Europeanized non-Indo-European language. Through the centuries Armenain has formed into a distinct language. Even during the bronze age, Urartu was more of a tribal confederation turned kingdom. Who knows what languages all those tribes spoke, and how much melding there was.\n\nHowever, irrespective of linguistics, culturally and genetically, Armenians can be considered successors of Urartu. After all, why do we not doubt that the modern day Central Americans, who speak Spanish, were not once the powerful Mayan, Aztec, and Incans who spoke a non-IE language? This would be most analogous to Armenians and Urartians.\n\nArmenians may not be linguistically related to the Urartians, but genetically and culturally, Armenians are the descendants of the Urartians.

I totally agree and your example of Latin Americans is really good!\n\nAs for the linguistic aspect the Urartian language was non-Indo-European, related to the languages of Caucasus (except the Kartevlian ones like Georgian and Laz). Proto-Armenian was a Balkanic language initially and that's why classical Armenian's closest relatives are Greek and Phrygian. Moving from the Balkans to Anatolia though exposed proto-Armenian to 1) Luwian, 2) Hurro-Urartian influence. In later times Armenian was exposed to Iranic languages like Old Persian and by time turned into a satem language.\n\nBasically the question of the thread is tricky. Urartian is not proto-Armenian, but the substratum of Armenian.\n\nSuccessors is the right word!

Urartian is not proto-Armenian, but the substratum of Armenian.\n\nIt is precisely because of this mix that leads me to conclude Armenian isn't a pure undo European language. The way I see it, proto-Armenian is comprised of many elemental languages. All these combined created proto-Armenian. That's way I think labeling Armenian as a indo European language is insufficient and doesn't justify the development of the Armenian language. For instance, there is a theory that Armenians themselves are a confederation of tribes. That is why the Greeks and Persians refer to Armenians as Armenia, in Georgia it is Somkheti, and in Armenian it is Hye. The theory is that all these names are names of different tribes that melded. What do you think?"
