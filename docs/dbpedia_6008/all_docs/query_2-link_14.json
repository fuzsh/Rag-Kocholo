        "text": "Armenia is an extremely old country with a rich background, dating back to the 6th century BC. Armenia, as it is known today, seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991, making Armenia as old as 2700 years, or as young as 31 years.\n\nThe Current State of Armenia\n\nArmenia has a rich history, dating back to the Orontid dynasty in the 6th century BC. As with most countries in the caucus and eastern bloc, much of their modern state reflects their political affairs after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Kingdom of Armenia was founded between 321BC and 428 AD and was an important trading partner between Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe for hundreds of years. It wasn't until 1918 that the Republic of Armenia was created, distancing itself from the traditional monarchical rule that shifted greatly with the introduction of the First World War."
