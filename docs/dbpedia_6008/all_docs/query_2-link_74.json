        "text": "Background: Armenia’s Political Transitions\n\nSimilar to the Arab Spring which traces its beginnings to long-festering grievances over unemployment, corruption, and human rights violations, the 2018 Armenian revolution was not an isolated event taking place in April that year. The revolution was driven by decades of hardship and abuses—from post-Soviet economic disarray and stagnation to large-scale corruption, election fraud, and human rights abuses carried out by a network of oligarchs and ruling-party politicians that captured the state.\n\nArmenians have gone through significant political transitions in their history, from the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century to the break-up of the Soviet Union and the emergence of a modern independent republic in 1991. The end of the socialist Armenian state and with it the privatization of many previously state-owned public enterprises led to economic and social turmoil. Conflict with Azerbaijan over a disputed region began in the late 1980s. It has led to tens of thousands of deaths and massive displacement. It also gave wartime leaders, including former Presidents Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan, the political capital to commit and cover up human rights violations and large-scale corruption, further weakening state institutions.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Armenians have protested electoral fraud, corruption, environmental harm, and various miscarriages of justice. Allegations of fraud involving the adoption of the 1995 constitution and the 1996 and 2004 elections provoked protests, which police violently suppressed. But it was the killing of 10 Armenian citizens—8 protesters and 2 policemen—in protests against election fraud in 2008 that prompted civil society groups to mobilize more systematically.\n\nIn 2015, after periodical social and political protests, some 20,000 Armenians took to the streets in the “Electric Yerevan” protests to oppose a 17 percent increase in the price of electricity and other austerity measures. The following year, a four-day escalation in the conflict with Azerbaijan brought attention to the scale of corruption in the military and the harsh conditions, even in non-combat zones, to which young conscripted Armenians were subjected and from which many were dying.\n\nIn early 2018, in order to get around the two-term limit that barred then-President Serzh Sargsyan from seeking a third one, the ruling party nominated him as prime minister, which would have allowed him to exercise broad executive powers under a controversial constitutional amendment. This ignited massive protests across Armenia, which culminated in the peaceful revolution that forced Sargysyan to resign on April 23, 2018, just a day before the 103rd official commemoration of the Armenian genocide. Nikol Pashinyan, a former journalist, political detainee, and opposition legislator who led the protests was named prime minister. In the snap parliamentary elections at the end of 2018, Pashinyan was then elected prime minister by a parliament consisting of many new, young legislators that formed the bulk of Pashinyan’s Civil Contract Party.\n\nThe 2020 resumption of the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the social and political impact of the hostilities prompted authoritarian-led governments in the region, alongside efforts by oligarchs and political forces in and outside the country, to roll back the democratic transition of 2018. Snap Parliamentary elections were again held in 2021. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his party won them in landslide, creating new opportunity for Armenians to consolidate and protect their democratic space, as well as fulfill the promise of transitional justice.\n\nWhat are emblematic examples of large-scale corruption and how are they linked to human rights violations? Large-scale corruption and violations of human rights, including economic and social rights, have been mutually reinforcing abuses since Armenia’s independence in 1991. In what is known as the North Avenue case, the Kocharyan government forcibly removed families living in a historic neighborhood in Yerevan and demolished their pre-Soviet-era homes by invoking “the state’s needs.” The project favored private developers with ties to oligarchs close to the then-ruling party.\n\nThe truth about the deaths of young soldiers in non-combat situations has been a continuing demand of their families. The military’s explanations have not assuaged the families because these deaths happened against the backdrop of corruption in military procurement and perceived cover-ups and obstruction of justice in the closing of criminal investigations involving these deaths. These deaths, which have continued even after the revolution, epitomize the intersection between and the persistent capture of the State by powerful oligarchs and their political allies and impunity for human rights violations and corruption.\n\nWhat transitional justice processes are being considered? The post-revolution government has tried to advance transitional justice and accountability by filing criminal cases of corruption and constitutional violations against two former presidents and some of their closest family members, applying pressure on high judicial officials to resign in order for the new government to introduce a set of proposed judicial reforms, debating judicial vetting in parliament, creating new agencies to investigate corruption and recover ill-gotten assets, and issuing official apologies and holding commemorations. However, no actual transitional justice policies have been enacted through legislation or implemented, and a transitional justice strategy has not been adopted. No significant measures have been taken to address demands by victims of human rights violations and their families seeking truth, reparations, and individual accountability for episodes of violent political repression, repeated or prolonged detention of opposition activists, the corrupt and unjust expropriation of property, and the deaths under suspicious circumstances of Armenian conscripts in non-combat situations.\n\nThe recent resumption of the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the social and political impact of the hostilities, once again highlight the urgent need for truth, accountability, and reforms in the country. Now more than ever, a strategy, rather than ad hoc measures, is needed to overcome the entrenched impunity for past corruption and human rights abuses and to assess the emerging post-conflict needs of Armenians. Transitional justice cannot meaningfully take place in circumstances where the same oligarchs, political leaders, and foreign governments that benefited from authoritarian rule and state capture are undermining or even seeking to roll back the democratic transition that created the opportunity for accountability. It is therefore important to not simply pursue transitional justice in the midst of Armenia’s renewed conflict with Azerbaijan, but to pursue it with the explicit goal of consolidating the democratic transition; protecting the human rights of Armenians including their rights to truth, justice, and reparation; and demonstrating to Armenia’s authoritarian-led neighbors its courage to seek the truth and its willingness to discuss peace with justice."
