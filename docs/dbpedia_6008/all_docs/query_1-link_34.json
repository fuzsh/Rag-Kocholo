        "text": "\"The foundation legends of the first capitals of Armenia and Georgia – Armawir and Armazi – have several common features. A specific cult of the moon god is attested in both cities in the triadic temples along with the supreme thunder god and the sun god. The names of Armawir and Armazi may be associated with the Anatolian Arma- ‘moon (god).’ The Armenian ethnonym (exonym) Armen may also be derived from the same stem.\"\n\nSanasar, the founder of the dynasty of heroes of the epic “Daredevils of Sasun,” is the epicized version of the thunder god, who has many common characteristics with the Indian and Hurrian thunder gods. On the other hand, Sanasar’s predecessor Aram, one of the ethnarchs of the Armenian ethnogonic myth, represents the Armenian counterpart of the Indian R􀀁ma, an epicized version of Indra. M􀀃ak, Aram’s governor of Cappadocia, is considered the eponym of the Phrygians. In Armenian and Indian tradition some traces of the Phrygian and Hurrian associations may be found, which may be considered in the historical context.\n\nIn Armenian tradition there are several theonyms derived from IE *wel- (> Arm. gel): god of otherworld Angel, mythological giant Turk‘ Angeleay, ethnogonic patriarchs Gelam and Ara(y) Gelec‘ik. Also, the huge “dragon stones”, concentrated on the Gelamay Mountains probably were called *gel before the Iranian loanword visap ‘dragon’ replaced their original name. These names and characters are considered in the context of the reconstruction of *wel- as an important stem in Indo-European mythology.\n\nThe names of gods of Armenian Pre-Christian pantheon are in majority of Iranian origin. Nevertheless, the figures of the gods and their cults have ancient roots in Armenia. The supreme god Aramazd, whose cult center was located in the village of Ani-Kamax (= Hittite Kummaha), is inseparable from the ancient local thunder and storm god Tešub/ Teišeba, whose centers bore similar names – Kumme, Kummanni (= classic Komana). The goddess Anahit was identical with the goddess of Komana (in antiquity – wife of Tešub). The figure of Mher, epicized version of the god Mihr, is derived from the Urartian god Haldi (I.M. Diakonoff). The cults of the majority of gods were located in a small area to the northwest of historic Armenia and are to be traced back to ancient local tradition – the gods of Hayasa."
