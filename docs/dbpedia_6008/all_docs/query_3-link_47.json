        "text": "mail:\n\nBill Thayer\n\nItaliano\n\nHelp\n\nUp\n\nHome\n\nAÂ History of Armenia\n\nby VahanÂ M. Kurkjian\n\nBackground\n\nWhen IÂ became interested in Armenia, mostly because of my focus on Antiquity, IÂ discovered there was not that much historical and antiquarian material online about the country, so this is my first contribution.\n\nThe dust-jacket of the 1964Â edition (for which, since my own copy is nude, IÂ am indebted to Gerald Ottenbreit,Â Jr. of the Armenian Research Center at the University of Michigan-Dearborn) includes the following information on Mr.Â Kurkjian:\n\nVahan Kurkjian's intended audience was thus the Armenian community in the United States: he has done them a great service, as well as to anyone seeking comprehensive basic information on Armenian history; and indeed, when he wrote, there seems to have been no other general history of Armenia in English: at any rate IÂ know of none other in the public domain that could therefore be presented online.\n\nCaution, though, is unfortunately in order. The author is clearly not a professional historian, and his book is not a scholar­ly work; rather, a general text based on ill assimilated (and now dated) secondary works. To boot, the book is both disordered and not well written, and in spots very poorly; aÂ good copy editor would have much improved it.\n\nThis short list of additional resources may therefore also prove useful:\n\nGeneral summaries of Armenian history, much briefer of course than our book:\n\nArmeniapedia\n\nLivius.Org (ancient Armenia thruÂ 330Â A.D.)\n\nMore generally, the other external sites listed on my Armenia homepage.\n\nSource material online, of great benefit to the serious student of Armenian history:\n\nRobert Bedrosian's site, a mine of excellent information on Armenian, Persian, Georgian, Turkish, and Iranian history: and specifically, detailed chronological tables and primary sources in his own English translations.\n\nOn ancient Armenia, an accurate, up-toâdate, scholar­ly book:\n\nAmÃ©lie Kuhrt, The Ancient Near East. c.Â 3000â330Â B.C. (2Â vols., Routledge, London and NewÂ York,Â 1995). Vol.Â I Ch.Â 5 is relevant to chaptersÂ VâVI of Kurkjian; Vol.Â II Ch.Â 10 is relevant to chaptersÂ VIIâX.\n\nCopyright, Proofreading\n\nAÂ History of Armenia by VahanÂ M. Kurkjian was first published inÂ 1958 by the Armenian General Benevolent Union of America. The text, actually taken here from the 1964Â reprinting, is in the public domain since the 1958Â copyright was not renewed at the appropriate time (1985â1986), and the work has therefore fallen into the public domain. (Details here on the copyright law involved.)\n\nAs usual, IÂ retyped the text rather than scanning it: not only to minimize errors prior to proofreading, but as an opportunity for me to become intimately familiar with the work, an exercise IÂ heartily recommend. (Well-meaning attempts to get me to scan text, if success­ful, would merely turn me into some kind of machine: gambit declined.)\n\nIn the table of contents below, the chapters and sections are given on blue backgrounds, indicating that they have been thoroughly proofread; any red backgrounds would indicate that my transcription had not yet been proofread. The header bar at the top of each webpage will remind you with the same color scheme. In any case, should you spot an error, please do report it, of course.\n\nThe book contains 65Â engravings and 28Â photographs. Some of them relate directly to the text, others illustrate it only loosely; I've reproduced all of them. Since a Web transcription is not bound by the same constraints as a print edition (no need to fit in a certain slot on a printed page, for example), occasionally they're not at quite the same point in the text. The original page location is given in the name of the image.\n\nFurther details on the technical aspects of the site layout follow the Table of Contents below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSpelling and Typographical Conventions\n\nThe 1964Â printing of Kurkjian's book was very poorly proofread. I've made some few corrections: not as many as IÂ would have liked to make â thus avoiding the slippery slope to rewriting the whole book! â but IÂ repaired obvious errors, as well as the most distracting mispunctuations, marking with visible bullet-prompts those worthy of note, and flagging the others in the sourcecode. Even more grating, to me, was the author's consistent capitalization of the centuries (\".Â .Â .Â in the Eleventh CenturyÂ .Â .Â .\"): IÂ tacit­ly restored normal usage thruout. If all these errors and quirks are finally of very little importance, correcting them does make the text more readable, and making the corrections visible serves as a reminder to the careful reader that the text as a whole is not as reliable as it could be.\n\nThere also seem to be, however, aÂ number of typographical errors in Armenian words and proper nouns, correcting which is both more important and much harder to do. Well aware of my own limitations, I've made only those very few corrections where IÂ felt on safe ground.\n\nIn addition to actual errors, variant spellings are a particular problem in this book. Kurkjian did not reduce his multiple sources to a single consistent system, and we thus have a frequently bewildering panoply of spellings for the same place or person, often two or even three different spellings in a single paragraph. Some of these variants are clearly due to his reliance on secondary sources in languages other than English (in particular, French); others we owe to dozens of local languages and transcription systems over several millennia of history; to different forms in Western, Eastern, and Classical Armenian; and finally others again, here too, are outright typographical errors. Yet I've refrained altogether from any attempt at homogenizing the text, not only because I'm the wrong person to be deciding on the transcription of Armenian and other Asiatic languages, but also because it will actually be useful to leave multiple spellings to be picked up by the search engines. Very occasionally, where one would like to see a standard English spelling â as in Parthian, Persian and Greek names â I've added a footnote.\n\nNotes and Links\n\nIn addition to the author's notes, here and there I've added some of my own, mostly by way of clarification, or steering the reader to other online resources. Where a major online resource is particularly germane to an entire chapter, you'll find a link to it in the footer bar at the bottom of that page.\n\nIÂ am happy to acknowledge the expert help of my friend Jona Lendering, webmaster of Livius and author of several books on the ancient Middle East, in harmonizing some of Kurkjian's statements and identifications with the current scholar­ly consensus: at Jona's request, IÂ haven't marked each of his individual contributions, but in general the less it looks like IÂ could have written something, the less IÂ probably did.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nIÂ am no Armenian expert, have never been to Armenia, have no Armenian ancestry that IÂ know of, and take only the following very general positions on Armenian questions: IÂ have long been aware of the important historical role of Armenia and her people in Antiquity and in early Christianity, IÂ am still horrified by the Turkish genocide ofÂ 1915 (and outraged by disingenuous claims that it didn't happen), and IÂ feel it's a good thing for Armenia to exist as a sovereign nation.\n\nIÂ also have very little taste for polemics, and in general feel that there are many sides to most questions: aÂ reminder therefore that this is just a transcription, and that the author speaks for himself. Specifically IÂ take no sides on any of the theological points raised, on Nestorianism, Chalcedon, Monophysitism, or the Uniate movement; nor on the relative merits or otherwise of the Armenian Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Orthodox Churches (although IÂ do fault their disunity for allowing the Mohammedan takeover of the Christian homeland of the Near East); nor on the identification of various ethnic or linguistic entities â i.e.,Â the various Greek and Macedonian questions, the Indo-European question,Â etc.\n\n\"Albania\" in this book refers to the region known as such in Antiquity, a Transcaucasian area completely unrelated to the modern country by the same name: if you are looking for information on the ancient history of the area on the Mediterranean coast now called Albania, you should be looking for \"Epirus\". Similarly, \"Iberia\" in this book refers to the Transcaucasian area roughly corresponding to the modern Republic of Georgia, and never to what is now Spain and Portugal (also known as Iberia in Antiquity, mind you)."
