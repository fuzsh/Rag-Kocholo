        "text": "Armenians like their Kurd neighbors, were promised a nation-state then betrayed to great powers interests when nation-states were being handed out at the fall of the Empires after World War I.\n\nThere are many types of Armenians and even more types of Kurds. Yezidi Kurds are the largest minority in Armenia. Kurds and Armenians live in many countries, and have lived in the region for as long as they have existed.\n\nThe elephant in the room is of course the Kurdish role in the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire and the so-called Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) later the Party of Union and Progress (PUP), and generally the fact that the majority of Muslims in historic Armenia are Kurds, and their Dynasties were installed by the Turks.\n\nMany Kurds, not only Zazas and Alevis, saved Armenians during the Genocide, and Yezidi Kurds were massacred as a consequence along with Armenians.\n\nAccording to The Armenian Literary Tradition at the Library of Congress, the ancient country of Armenia, located on the Armenian Plateau in Eastern Anatolia in the middle of a well-traversed land bridge between east and west, is known as “Hayastan or Hayasa” to its people, who call themselves “Hay.”\n\nThe region has been populated since Neolithic times, and petroglyphs from this period dot the landscape, bearing witness to the life of its prehistoric peoples.\n\nModern DNA research indicates that many people who today call themselves Armenian descend from the most ancient peoples of Anatolia. The Biblical Hittite Empire and the Kingdom of Urartu (Ararat, 900 to 600 BC) were among those that ruled the area.\n\nBronze Age demographic processes had a major impact on the genetics of populations in the Armenian Highlands. Armenians appear to originate from a mixture of diverse populations occurring from 3000 BC to 2000 BC.\n\nThis period coincides with the Kura-Araxes culture, the appearance of Hittites in Anatolia, major population migrations after the domestication of the horse, and the appearance of chariots. It also coincides with the legendary foundation of the Armenian nation in 2492 BC.\n\nBecause of its geography and location, the Armenian Kingdom of Hayasa was among the most important regions of the classical world, and flourished in the region between 1080-1375 CE before it fell to the Mamluks and was later incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1453 CE.\n\nAccording to the A genetic atlas of human admixture history published by Hellenthal et al. in 2014, admixture is not inferred or is uncertained.\n\nResearch using the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system, profiles of select Middle Eastern groups suggests that the Hittite's descendants are the Armenians and Kurds.\n\nArmenian and Kurdish HLA profiles have been studied for the first time and the comparative study of their allele frequencies, characteristic haplotypes, and genetic distances with other Mediterraneans is complemented by neighbor-joining dendrograms and correspondence analyses.\n\nKurds, Armenians, Iranians, Jews, Lebanese and other (Eastern and Western) Mediterranean groups seem to share a common ancestry: the older \"Mediterranean\" substratum.\n\nNo sign of a postulated \"Indo-European invasion\" at 1200 BC is detected by the genetic analysis. It is concluded that this invasion, if it occurred, had relatively few invaders in comparison to the already settled populations, i.e. Anatolian Hittite and Hurrian (Mitanni) groups (older than 2000 BC). These may have given rise to the present-day Armenian and Kurdish populations.\n\nHittite inscriptions deciphered in the 1920s by the Swiss scholar Emil Forrer testify to the existence of a mountain country, the Hayasa and/or the Azzi, lying around Lake Van. Several prominent authorities agree in placing Azzi to the north of Ishuwa. Others see Hayasa and Azzi as identical.\n\nAn alternate theory suggests that Armenians were tribes indigenous to the northern shores of Lake Van or Urartu's northern periphery (possibly as the Hay/Hayasans, Etuini, and/or Diauehi, all of whom are known only from references left by neighboring peoples such Hittites, Urartians and Assyrians)\n\nSome have suggested a continuity with the Hittite name Arnuwanda. Various Greek transcriptions of the name in Classical sources are spelled as Orontes, Aruandes or Ardoates…\n\nAlthough there were some Kurdish tribes that didn't have amicable relationships with the Armenian locals, the Armenians and the Kurds managed to co-exist, until the late 19th century. Just before the genocide, Kurdish and Armenian people became so intertwined that most of their villages in the region were side by side.\n\nToday Armenia's population is ethnically homogenous. Armenians belong to the Europoid and Armenoid race types. Main physical characteristics of Armenians are short and round skull, long and curved nose, dark brown or black hair, dark eyes, thick eyebrows, and light skin…\n\nFood for thought!"
