        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nHistory of Political Economy 35.2 (2003) 346-348\n\n[Access article in PDF]\n\nFriedrich Hayek: A Biography. By Alan Ebenstein. New York: Palgrave, 2001. xiii; 403 pp. $29.95.\n\n“The purpose of this work is to trace the intellectual life of Friedrich Hayek. Hayek was the greatest philosopher of liberty during the twentieth century” (xi).\n\nThis book has its virtues, not the least of which is its readability. But it is not a book for economists, nor for those who the author persists in calling “economic historians,” that is, historians of economics. From our point of view Hayek is not well served by his disciples who neglect his contributions to economics in favor of his later writings in social philosophy.\n\nFriedrich August von Hayek was born in Vienna on 8 May 1899. He served with the field artillery of the Austro-Hungarian army on the Italian front before studying law and economics at the University of Vienna (1918–21). After completing his doctoral dissertation while working for a government agency set up to deal with the financial clauses of the peace treaty, he spent just over a year in the United States in 1923–24. With an introduction from Ludwig von Mises to Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks he worked as Jenks's research assistant for six months and registered as a doctoral student at New York University, also attending lectures at Columbia, especially those of Wesley Mitchell. On his return from America Hayek became an active participant in Mises's famous seminar; when Mises set up the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research in 1927 he appointed Hayek as its first director. By 1929 Hayek had obtained his Privatdozentur and began lecturing at the University of Vienna. Ebenstein tries, with some success, to evoke the atmosphere of Vienna and its famous university, and he provides many details of Hayek's childhood and early adult life, taken from unpublished autobiographical notes and those published in Hayek on Hayek (1994) as well as the interviews Hayek gave to members of the Oral History Program at UCLA."
