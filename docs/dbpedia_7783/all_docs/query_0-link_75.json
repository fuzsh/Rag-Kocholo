HAYEK\n\nAUSTRIAN CIVIL AWARDS AND DECORATIONS\n\nDas Grosse Goldene Ehrenzeichen. 50mm. medallion with white cross within a larger red cross surmounted by a gold federal eagle surrounded by coats of arms on a red and white ribbon, with silver breast star similarly with gold federal eagle surrounded by coats of arms, and small rosette of red and white, housed in original red leather box with gilt coat of arms;\n\nDas Grosse Goldene Ehrenzeichen. printed citation, dated 24 January 1990, signed and sealed, with additional signed typescript letter regarding the award, both in a red portfolio with gilt coat of arms;\n\nLeistungen den Ehrenring der Stadt Wien. gold armorial ring bearing the coat of arms of the Vienna, engraved with “Ehrenring | Der Stadt Wien |Univ. Prof. DDR. Dr. | H.C. F.A. Hayek | 30.9.1983”, housed in original red leather box with the same coat of arms and “Wien Bundeshauptstadt” in gold;\n\nLeistungen den Ehrenring der Stadt Wien. printed citation dated September 1983, signed and sealed, housed in a red portfolio with repeated gilt motif of the coat of arms;\n\nÖsterreichisches Ehrenzeichen für Wissenschaft und Kunst. printed citation, dated 17 July 1974, signed and sealed, housed in a red portfolio with gilt coat of arms\n\nThese awards presumably had particular resonance to the Austrian economist.\n\nHayek was born in Vienna to a university professor and the daughter of a wealthy conservative land-owning family. At 18 he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army, fighting on the Italian front in 1917. He studied at the University of Vienna earning doctorates in both law and political science (1921 and 1923 respectively).\n\nAlthough Hayek left Austria in 1930 for the United Kingdom, and would not return live to permanently in his country from this point onwards, it is perhaps telling that academics still firmly place him in the 'Austrian School' of economics, and credit him with the movement's renaissance in the 20th century."
