        "text": "In 1961 Hayek accepted the call for a professorship for economic policy at the University of Freiburg (Breisgau) and was not far later elected as director of the Walter Eucken Institute. In the following years he developed amongst others his important articles concerning the theory of spontaneous collocation and the conception of competition as a discovering process. In 1967 Hayek retired but rested representative of his own former chair until 1969. The importance of his works is not least expressed by the fact that he obtained the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974.\n\nAfter a stay in Salzburg as an honorary professor for some years he returned to Freiburg in 1977. The Walter Eucken Institute appointed him to its honorary president in 1978. At that time, he finished the trilogy ‘Law, Legislation and Liberty’ (1973, 1976 and 1979), which has already been partly developed in the sixties and has to be seen as Hayek’s most important work beside ‘The Constitution of Liberty’. In 1988 his fundamental criticism of socialism: ‘The Fatal Conceit – The Errors of Socialism’ was published. Hayek died 23. March 1992 in Freiburg."
