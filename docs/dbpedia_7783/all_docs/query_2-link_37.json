        "text": "Friedrich August von Hayek was born in 1899 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He was a renowned economist and philosopher, best known for his defense of classical liberalism.\n\nHe received his education at the University of Vienna, where he also began his academic career before moving to the London School of Economics. There, he taught for almost two decades. In 1937, he became a British citizen and remained so for rest of his life even though he left Great Britain in 1950.\n\nHe then became a professor of social and moral sciences at the University of Chicago, where he stayed until 1962. The rest of his career, von Hayek spent at the University of Freiburg, West Germany, and the University of Salzburg in Austria.\n\nIn 1974, von Hayek shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal. He was also appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984; he was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984, and also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush."
