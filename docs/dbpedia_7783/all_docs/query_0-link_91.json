        "text": "Economist Joseph Herbert Furth (1899-1995) was born in Vienna. He was a student friend of Friedrich Hayek and later became the brother-in-law of Gottfried Haberler. In 1943 he was hired by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington D.C. and retired in 1966. Throughout his life he corresponded extensively with his fellow ex-pat Austrians. His papers are found at the University of Albany’s German and Jewish Intellectual Émigre Collections and the Hoover Institution archives. I found a printed copy of the complete NBC Meet the Press interview with Friedrich Hayek from June 22, 1975 in Furth’s Hoover Institution archived papers.\n\nWhen I checked to see if there was an on-line copy of this interview available, I discovered that the first portion of the interview that took place before station identification and commercial break was not included in either the audio or printed copies that I was able to find.\n\nEconomics in the Rear-view Mirror now provides for the digital record both halves of the Hayek interview.\n\nFun fact: the only living witness as of this posting is Washington Post columnist, George Will, who was 34 years old when the Hayek interview was broadcast.\n\n___________________________\n\nThe existing incomplete transcript\n\nOnly the second half of the interview (after the commercial announcements) has been posted on-line up to this time.\n\nTranscript prepared by Karen Y.

Most recently he has been a visiting professor at the University of Salzburg. He is the author of the international best. seller, “The Road to Serfdom.”\n\nDr. von Hayek is a native of Austria and a citizen of Great Britain. He is completing a three months’ visit in this country.\n\nWe will have the first questions now from Irving R. Levine of NBC News.\n\nLEVINE: Dr. von Hayek, through your long career you have consistently warned about the dangers of government policies that contribute to inflation. Last year this country had an increase in the cost of living of over 12 per cent. This year, because of the recession, so far the cost of living has gone up about half that rate, about 6 per cent. Do you think that the danger of inflation has passed in this country?\n\nVON HAYEK: Oh, very far from it. People will be aware that as a result of stopping inflation there is unemployment, and they still believe that they can cure inflation by unemployment, which is wrong, because in the long run it only creates more unemployment.\n\nLEVINE: How do you cure inflation?\n\nVON HAYEK: You stop printing money.\n\nLEVINE: Dr. von Hayek, you have pointed out that continued inflation over a period of time would lead to anarchy and to a form of dictatorship.\n\nIs that a theoretical danger or do you see that as some kind of a real danger in this country?\n\nVON HAYEK: Its connection is not so simple. I have been stressing that central planning has these effects, and inflation is likely to produce central planning, but inflation by itself is not likely to have any such direct consequences, because while inflation proceeds people are much too busy just coping with the changes.\n\nLEVINE: You have cited a stop to the printing of money as the way to end inflation. That seems simple, as stated. How could the government actually accomplish that?\n\nVON HAYEK: Well, you give orders to the printing press. Exaggerating. We can give orders to the Federal Reserve System. The only trouble is that stopping inflation has immediately some very unpleasant effects, and the question is always whether the government is willing to incur these effects, such as the unemployment, and perhaps, the necessity of reducing some expenditures.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nWILL: Dr. von Hayek, in the 30 years since World War II, some nations’ economies have done very much better than others. West Germany’s, for example, has done much better than Great Britain’s. Are there any generalizations you can draw from these? What is the secret to success and the secret to problems?\n\nVON HAYEK: It is a very complicated issue, but there is one simple point. The German trade unions were extraordinarily sensible, and they were sensible because they remembered what inflation meant. I think it has certain implications. This sense may not last long, because the generation which remembers it is now going off, and I am rather apprehensive about the future.\n\nWILL: Dr. von Hayek, we have a basically conservative administration in the United States today, but even it is facing planned deficits more or less planned deficits exceeding perhaps $100 billion in the next two years. Do you think this will cause a renewed and perhaps socially destructive inflation?\n\nVON HAYEK: It is not unlikely, I am afraid. As long as the governing people are persuaded that inflation of this sort is even beneficial in its effect, the tendency in that direction will be very great. I think it all depends on persuading the responsible people of the danger of inflation.\n\nROWEN: Dr. von Hayek, you talked in response to Mr. Levine of a painful adjustment, of the unpleasant effects that we would have to endure in order to beat inflation. With all due respect, sir, aren’t your theories somewhat unrealistic in a political sense? Do you visualize governments today being able to take such steps as you recommend?\n\nVON HAYEK: Perhaps, I’m unrealistic. As long as people do not fully realize the danger of inflation, they may well pressure for more inflation as a short term remedy for evils, so we may well be driven into more until people have learned the lesson. What it means is that inflation will still do a great deal of harm before it will be cured.\n\nROWEN: To be specific, what rate of unemployment do you think this country ought to be willing to tolerate in order to beat inflation? 12 percent, 15 percent?\n\nVON HAYEK: It is not a question of what the country is willing to tolerate. The longer you have inflation, the greater unemployment becomes inevitable. You will have to choose. It is not a matter that government can avoid the unemployment that is caused by the previous misdirection of labor which the inflation has produced\n\nROWEN: But when you speak of unpleasant effects, just what are you talking about that the country would have to endure? It must be some level of unemployment that you are thinking of that would result if we do cure inflation.\n\nVON HAYEK: In a period of inflation, a lasting inflation, when, if you want to achieve a tolerably stable position, you will have to go through a period of unemployment which may well last more than a year,\n\nROWEN: And how high could that get?\n\nVON HAYEK: I couldn’t say. I would have to know much more about the specific conditions, but it would not exclude a temporary rise to 13, 14 percent, or something of the sort.\n\nROWEN: Do you think the social fabric of this country could tolerate a 14 percent rate of unemployment?\n\nVON HAYEK: For a few months, certainly.\n\nSHANAHAN: Professor von Hayek, your fellow Nobel laureate, Professor Leontiev [sic], is an advocate of planning, and two of our prominent Senators, Humphrey and Javits, have introduced legislation to implement his idea, which is largely a matter of study by various government agencies and recommendations, nothing compulsory.\n\nDo you see in that kind of planning the same dangers that you see in a more mandatory form?\n\nVON HAYEK: If it is really nothing compulsory, it will also be completely ineffective and therefore will do no harm. I think there is a very simple answer. He really imagines that somehow people are being made to do what he is planning.\n\nSHANAHAN: The thought I believe that they have expressed is that such things as foreseeing shortages of industrial productive capacity could be highlighted and the industries encouraged to go ahead with the building of new plants, that sort of thing. Do you encompass that in your thought that it would be completely ineffective?\n\nVON HAYEK: Why call it planning? If you can, give industry better information, by all means do.\n\nSHANAHAN: Can we then say you support that legislation despite your fears of planning?\n\nVON HAYEK: It has nothing to do with planning.\n\nSPIVAK: Dr. von Hayek, did I understand you to say in answer to Mr. Levine’s question that the way to stop inflation is to stop the printing presses? Are you suggesting that that is what we are doing here, that we are just printing money and that is the way this inflation has started and that is the way this is continuing and that is the way it will continue.\n\nVON HAYEK: In a sense, stopping the printing presses is a figurative expression, because it is being done now by creating credit by the Federal Reserve System. By this government action all inflation is ultimately a part of activities which government determines and can control, and all inflations have been stopped in the past by the government stopping creating money or preventing central banks from creating more money.\n\nMay I add just one thing. You see, all inflations have been stopped by people who believed in a very naive form of the quantitative [sic] theory and acted on that. It may be wrong, but it is the only adequate theory effectively to stop an inflation.\n\nSPIVAK: You have been a student, I am sure, of the United States, because you taught here for many years. What do you think has started our inflation? We have had inflation for a number of years, and I don’t think that we were printing money at that time or that the Federal Reserve was necessarily dumping a great deal of money. What do you think was responsible for the beginning of our inflation?\n\nVON HAYEK: The belief in the deliberate increase of aggregate demands as a means of creating employment. In effect, what is popularly called belief in Keynesian policies to create employment.\n\nLEVINE: Dr. von Hayek, the general belief among administration economists is that we are near or at the bottom of the recession that we have been going through. Do I understand you to be saying we should be willing to experience a continuation of this period of low economic activity for another year or so rather than to take the kind of efforts that the government has taken of a tax cut in order to stimulate the economy?\n\nVON HAYEK: The matter of the tax cut again aims at increasing aggregate amounts, and the present difficulty is not due to a deficiency of aggregate demand. It is due to the fact that without continued inflation you cannot maintain the people in the new employment in which they have been drawn by the inflation of the past.\n\nLEVINE: I would like to pursue the first part of my question. Do you see a necessity, in order to avoid a resurgence of inflation, that the government undertake policies which will continue us at the present low level of economic activity for a period of a year or more?\n\nVON HAYEK: Not necessarily at the low level, but we should not produce more than a very slow recovery. I would like to add this: The slower the recovery is, the better are the chances that it will last.\n\nLEVINE: In a speech before a congressional group not long ago, you said that the threat to the free enterprise system of our society has never been more imminent than it is now. What did you mean by that?\n\nVON HAYEK: Because I am afraid that government will continue to inflate to combat unemployment and try to meet the effects by imposing price controls, and if we use price controls for that purpose, we are driven into a centrally planned system.\n\nWILL: Thirty years ago, Dr. von Hayek, you stressed and have subsequently stressed that political and economic liberties must either flourish together or perish together. Do you see signs, specifically in the United States today, or in Great Britain, with which you are familiar, that political liberty is endangered?\n\nVON HAYEK: In Great Britain certainly. When it is quite clear that by the established democratic process you cannot conduct that kind of economic policy the present governing party wants to conduct, the danger of a reduction of political liberty in Great Britain is considerable.\n\nIn this country this is not so imminent, very largely for the reason that the efforts have not been directed so much towards a nationalization and direct government controls of industry, but the attempts have been made by a redistribution of incomes by taxation, and that is a much slower process. I think it tends in the same direction, but much more slowly than the other one.\n\nROWEN: Dr. von Hayek, how do you rate the impact of market power wielded by either unions or corporations as a factor in inflation? You seem to be putting all of the stress on the quantity of money and the printing press. Isn’t part of our inflation and part of the inflation in some other parts of the world due to the excessive market power of labor unions and corporations?\n\nVON HAYEK: Never directly, when it may well be and frequently happens that because of the power of the unions, perhaps of the corporations, government feels compelled to inflate. It becomes the inducement for government action, but the immediate cause is always increase of the quantity of money by government, whatever the inducement to do so.\n\nROWEN: Returning to the crisis in Great Britain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told me on Wednesday that the Cabinet will consider a return to a formal wage-price-incomes policy. What effect, if any, do you think that would have on the very high level of British inflation in wages and prices?\n\nVON HAYEK: I don’t think it will help at all. You see, it might be necessary as a temporary measure, at the moment when you are in a position to stop the increase of the quantity of money. I do not see any prospect at all in the near future of the British government effectively stopping an increase in the quantity of money. In that situation you just disguise the effects of inflation for a time.\n\nROWEN: What would be your prescription for the ills that afflict Great Britain?\n\nVON HAYEK: It is a problem of first persuading the public that in the present situation the pressure of the trade unions does not deserve public support. That you must achieve before you can do anything by legislation, reducing the powers of the trade unions. It must be a long process. I don’t see any immediate cure.\n\nSHANAHAN: Professor von Hayek, you have always stressed government actions that inflate and government planning and controls as a great danger to our political freedom.\n\nMany Americans see another scenario for loss of freedom in this country, which is economic policies that now have unemployment in the center cities among black youths over 40 per cent and that their anger and frustration can lead to violence which in turn will lead to repressive governmental action.\n\nWhat do you say to that scenario? Can we just sit idly by and let that happen?\n\nVON HAYEK: No, but it is with respect to the same cause. The unemployment of which you speak, which is the initial cause, is due to labor being temporarily directed into places or activities or industries where they cannot be maintained without further inflation. Therefore you can only cure that by achieving a new redistribution of labor between employments, adaptation to a condition in which aggregate demands need not progressively increase to maintain their employment.\n\nSHANAHAN: You have said in everything you have written and said lately that this is a lengthy process, that we won’t get back to stable money quickly. Meanwhile, what do you do with these urgent problems and human hardships?\n\nVON HAYEK: We must not assume that all problems are solvable in this short period. There are problems which we cannot solve or which trying to solve quickly may do more harm than good.\n\nSHANAHAN: But in the meantime, what do you do with the human hardship and the mounting rage that is certainly building up?\n\nVON HAYEK: I don’t think there is anything I can do about it. We will have to tide over the storm which may be threatening.\n\nSPIVAK: Dr. von Hayek, may we get a bit specific on one particular thing, and that is Great Britain? You are a citizen of Great Britain. You have taught there and I think you know something about the economy there. As I understand it, their inflation rate may hit as high as 50 per cent. What is the consequence of something of that kind? What do you see is going to happen in the country of which you are a citizen?\n\nVON HAYEK: You’ve got a very severe economic crisis with very extensive unemployment the moment inflation stops. We will probably have repetitive attempts to restart the process by returning to inflation. We will probably combat the wrong thing, the effect of inflation on prices by price controls. That will lead to centrally-directed economy, which will weaken the international economic position of Britain even worse, and that will probably result in the position that somebody may decide that the direction of economic policy has to be completely changed.\n\nI almost hope that the severe crisis will come soon, won’t be a long, dragged out process of misery, but I don’t see any immediate chance with the present political situation in England of such a complete change in the economic policy as would be required.\n\nSPIVAK: Are you saying that England is either going to go bankrupt or England is going to become a dictatorship? What specifically do you mean is going to happen in Great Britain?\n\nVON HAYEK: The English people are beginning to experience, which they hardly have yet, that they have become very much poorer and are rapidly getting poorer still and that will lead to the resolution or the recognition that the policy of the past was wrong.\n\nThe amazing fact is that a great majority of the British people are not yet consciously aware that they are living in a very severe economic crisis, and for that reason they are not willing to consider themselves a complete change in policy.\n\nSPIVAK: But what do you think is going to happen since you believe that? What is going to happen there? Are they going bust, or are they going into a dictatorship?\n\nVON HAYEK: No country can go bust. All that can happen is that the economic conditions of daily life get much worse through scarcities. People will find their income is no longer sufficient to maintain their standard of life. They will come to distrust both the present government and the present policies and may then be willing to return to an altogether different system. But I am not a prophet. I can’t say how soon.\n\nSPIVAK: And do you think if we follow along our present footsteps the same thing is going to happen to us?\n\nVON HAYEK: Yes, but in 10 or 20 years’ time. It is not a problem for the immediate future.\n\nLEVINE: Dr. von Hayek, to try to translate some of the things that you have been saying into the terms of the pocket-book of the average American, what advice would you give an American with savings of 20, 30, maybe 100,000 dollars? What should he do with that money to protect it against the problems of inflation that you have been discussing?\n\nVON HAYEK: I still believe there is nothing better than putting it into equities, although that even doesn’t promise him today that it will actually preserve it, but it gives him a good chance of preserving a substantial portion of it.\n\nLEVINE: Dr. von Hayek, these theories which you have gained such recognition for over a period of years have warned consistently, as has been pointed out, of the dangers and threats of inflation, and yet this country has undergone inflation for a great many years and the standard of living has consistently increased.\n\nDoes this lead you to question in any way your thesis?\n\nVON HAYEK: Not in the least, because the dangers of inflation are very different ones. They are exactly the kind of unemployment which is now arising. I mean in the usual discussion there is quite a wrong emphasis. There are many bad effects of inflation, but the worst is that it draws labor into employments where they can be kept employed only by accelerating inflation, and the point inevitably arises when inflation cannot be accelerated sufficiently fast to keep them in that inflation. Inflation is like overeating and indigestion. Overeating is very pleasant. So is inflation. Indigestion comes only afterwards, and therefore people do not see the connection.\n\nSPIVAK: We have less than two minutes.\n\nWILL: Dr. von Hayek, capitalism, and particularly American capitalism would seem to have a good record at giving people a rising standard of living.\n\nWhy are so many intellectuals and particularly so many economists skeptical about and even hostile to capitalism?\n\nVON HAYEK: I have been puzzling about it for a long time, particularly about the economists who also understand better, and it is very difficult to know why they don’t. I think it is an attraction of a system an intellectual attraction of a system which you can deliberately control, which is fascinating to the intellectual.\n\nROWEN: Dr. von Hayek, coming back quickly to Great Britain, isn’t it possible if we pursued your philosophy and theory that we might destroy capitalism there, rather than save it, looking at the analogy of the Italians?\n\nVON HAYEK: No, it is not likely to become worse. The present tendency would destroy capitalism inevitably. I think the important thing is that people are given a chance to change their mind before it is irrevocably destroyed.\n\nSPIVAK: I am sorry to interrupt, but our time is almost up, and we won’t be able to get another question and another answer.\n\nThank you, Dr. von Hayek, for being with us today on MEET THE PRESS.\n\nSource: Hoover Institution Archives.

Not trusting university governing structures, Simons hoped to established an Institute of Political Economy that would dock onto the university but remain an independent beacon of traditional-liberal economics.\n\nI presumed the unnamed angel in all this was the William Volker Fund, but David Levy thinks the Earhart Foundation would have been a more likely addressee, given the list of people named by Simons. I find it curious that Simons never explicitly mentions a target foundation for his proposal though he had no reservations about including a long list of names of the economists he expected to support the work of his proposed Institute of Political Economy.\n\nHutchins wrote back to Simons in early September 1945, “I understand from the angel that Hayek has submitted another program, which has no relation to economics.” Simons’ proposal can be considered to have been an elevator pitch for a Chicago-based pre-Mont-Pèlerin Society.\n\nPro-tip.\n\nAccording to the University of Chicago Archive’s Guide to the Henry C. Simons Papers, 1925-1972, Box 8, Folder 9 contains Simons’ file regarding his “Institute of Political Economy” proposal. The material for this post all come from Office of the President.

He feared that outsiders to the department might be tempted to appoint some convex combination of New Dealer Rexford Tugwell and trust-bustin’ George W. Stocking Sr., economists of the institutional persuasion who were swimming on the edges of the mainstream of the time.\n\n______________________\n\nCover memo from Henry Simons to Robert M.

Enclosed find two memoranda which are the poor results of my efforts. Memorandum II is mainly just a condensation of I—and is perhaps better suited for strangers.\n\nI have departed very far from the kind of project we discussed here. I cannot muster or sustain much enthusiasm for any short-term project, or for any project which aims merely at another book or series of tracts. So much good money and professional effort has been wasted on such enterprises. My guess is that one should be less diffident about proposing what one really wants—that one might get both more (and “better”) money and fare better results by projecting something which the active participants might undertake and pursue with conviction and enthusiasm. Honesty is probably the best policy, even when seeking endowment funds.\n\nI have contrived a project largely for what one might call ulterior purposes: (1) to get Aaron Director back here and into a kind of work for which he has, as you know, real enthusiasm and superlative talents; (2) to effect an arrangement regarding visiting professors which I have long espoused. Moreover, I have deliberately formulated the kind of project for which this University would be the natural location and for which Aaron would be a natural choice as head. But I doubt if such ulterior purposes condemn the scheme; on the contrary, the best procedure probably is that of making new schemes to do old things that one has long regarded as desirable. Indeed, the new device, as regards the stream of visitors, has very special merits, for it permits a continuity in the contribution of the visitors which could hardly be achieved otherwise.\n\nI am sorry to have organized Lutz out of the picture—and hope he might be “organized in” again from time to time or permanently. He is probably the best choice for your kind of project; but Aaron seems a better choice for mine, if only by the nature of his own preferences and interests—although Lutz, in turn, would be a better choice for my project if it were located at Princeton.\n\nMy scheme may have little or no appeal to the particular donor. I’ve gotten too intrigued with formulating a project to give attention to its saleability to any individual.\n\nWe’re still sad about having seen so little of you and about having failed to keep you on for the Summer.\n\nCordially,\n\nHenry C. Simons\n\nHCS:w\n\nEncl. 2 [Note: only memorandum 1 is to be found in the Hutchins file]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMemorandum I on a proposed\n\nINSTITUTE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nIt may clarify all that I have to say here if I start with confession of my personal interests and selfish purposes.\n\nA distinctive feature of “Chicago economics,” as represented recently by Knight and Viner, is its traditional-liberal political philosophy—its emphasis on the virtues of dispersion of economic power (free markets) and of political decentralization (real federalism for large nations and for supra-national organization). With the scattering of the “Austrians” and the vastly changed complexion of economics at Cambridge and Harvard, this intellectual tradition (of Smith, Ricardo, Mill, Menger, Wieser, Sidgwick, Marshall, Pigou, Clark, Taussig, Fisher, and Fetter, and of Locke, Hume, Bentham, de Tocqueville, von Humboldt, Acton and Dicey) is now almost unrepresented among the great universities, save for Chicago; and it may not long be well represented at Chicago. It has still many firm adherents, to be sure; but its competent representatives are widely dispersed and isolated from one another, in academic departments or governmental bureaus where they are largely denied opportunity for cooperation with like-minded scholars, or for recruiting and training their successors.\n\nThere should, I submit, be at least one university in United States where this political-intellectual tradition is substantially and confidently represented—and represented not merely by individual professors but also by a small group really functioning as a social-intellectual group. This objective presents difficulties, to be sure. Universities will seek to maintain balanced representation of major schools of thought (if not every fashionable novelty), in economics as in other departments; a group of traditional liberals large enough to function effectively might either dominate unduly any single economics department or require, for adequate representation of other “schools,” a department of excessive size. Moreover, traditional labels, individualists in political ideology, tend also to be lone -wolves and excessively individualist in their social-intellectual activities. More than other economists, they must, for real group activity, be selected with regard for their individual propensities for working with one another; if not inordinately friendly and congenial as persons, they are likely to go their separate ways, instead of cooperating, even if propinquity invites a more fruitful community activity.\n\nConsequently, I see much merit in planning for such a group—for such a small social organization of traditional-liberal economists—without total reliance on departmental or university policy and with some loosely or informally affiliated “center” or “institute.” A few traditional-liberal professors might then function both as members of university departments, representing a suitable variety of schools or ideologies and not overlarge, and also as members of a different group centering around the small “institute” or “center” and organized deliberately in terms of a political philosophy or ideology.\n\nSuch an institute (Institute for Political Economy) should have a permanent head (Mr. Aaron Director). It should offer services, especially stenographic and mimeographing, for its local group. As its main function, it should, normally in cooperation with the university and department(s), arrange and partly finance extended visits of the best economists and political philosophers of its “school” from all over the world, one or two at a time. It might arrange local lectures or seminar talks by such economists when they happen to be passing through the city. It might sponsor a small local discussion club for faculty, advanced students, and selected outsiders. It might offer a few special fellowships for advanced study—for traditional-liberal economists (teachers, bureaucrats, journalists) as we now offer them for agricultural economists. It might help finance the writing and research of a few cooperating economists not visitors here. Above all, however, it should facilitate the group activity of the interested local professors and maintain a steady flow of competent visitors. From all its activities, a better flow of publications, both scholarly and semi-popular, might be anticipated; but this result should be planned by indirection—stimulated or facilitated rather than required under contracts with participants.\n\nThe permanent head of the Institute should be a broadly competent economist, with a major interest in a political philosophy and 19th century English political economic thought. He should be young enough to do creative work and yet mature enough to assure against his stepping out of character as a libertarian. He should be an essentially intellectual person, not a promoter, not politically ambitious or “on the make,” not “the administrator type,” not prominently identified with other organizations or public activity, and not adept at salesmanship or public relations. Indeed, the Institute should have no organized “public relations” at all, should cultivate obscurity, and, while promoting some popular writing, should seek primarily to make its influence felt in the best professional and academic circles, and merely by improving the quality of the writing (and teaching) of individuals. It should not ordinarily engage in publication or seek to identify itself in connection with the publications of its members or participants. Its head should be simply one scholar among scholars, seeking to hold together a group of individuals characterized by common political-economic persuasions, and to help them to help one another—by free interchange of ideas, mutual criticism of preliminary manuscripts, etc.\n\nAn important function of the Institute, indeed, should be that of providing typing, mimeographing, and mailing services for affiliated economists. It might facilitate organized discussion (1) of what people intend to write about, (2) of what they have prepared as tentative drafts, and (3) of what they are about ready to publish. Such discussion, besides stimulating writing, should greatly improve its quality, enabling an individual, before publishing, to thresh out disagreements with competent colleagues or, at least, to recognize what their disagreements or dissents are.\n\nThe most obvious merit of the scheme, for the University, lives in the plan of bringing in, for extended visits, the best available libertarian economists from other institutions and other countries. Such visitors might mainly or largely be younger men considered more or less eligible for regular appointment to the University faculty. In many cases, the University might be able to “look over” such men without the usual awkwardness of that process—to have them around for six or twelve months without any implied commitment to retain or even to “consider” them for permanent appointment. I should hope that the Institute would, in effect, deeply influence appointments to the faculty, merely by bringing excellent persons whom everyone, knowing them by their visit, would recognize as desirable appointees. It might also improve appointments by itself making this community more attractive to the best candidates.\n\nThe closest cooperation between the Institute and the University in the selection of visitors should be maintained. For distinguished visitors nominated by institute, the University might occasionally bear all, and often half, of the cost. For prospective appointees, the University might occasionally use the Institute as a dummy, thus getting a look at the candidate with a minimal [sic] of involvement and without risk of building up expectations that might be unpleasantly disappointed. Normally, it might be hoped that visitors would nominally divide their time between the Institute and the university, each bearing part of the cost.\n\nI naturally would choose Chicago as a location for such an institute, and the University of Chicago as the institution with which to associate it. More substantial reasons than my personal predilections, however, could be offered for this choice. “Chicago economics” still has some distinctively traditional-liberal connotations and some prestige. Here, more than elsewhere, the project would be that of sustaining or keeping alive something not yet lost or submerged—and something which here, too, will shortly be lost unless special measures are taken.\n\nHowever, I am somewhat open-minded about the location—and should myself be more than ready to go elsewhere, even at financial sacrifice, in order to participate in the kind of intellectual community in question. Likewise, I suspect that many able people might be attracted, at moderate stipends, to any good university where such a prospect was reasonably assured.\n\nAnd I will concede that the outlook at Chicago, if better than elsewhere, is not very promising. Our Divisional dean has no appreciation of economic liberalism and a distinct hostility toward it, and the same is true of most persons in the other social science departments. Among higher administrative offices, there is at best only indifference, or provisional toleration, toward such political economy. A few members of the Law School and School of Business are interested or sympathetic, as are other individual faculty members here and there. In the department, moreover, we are becoming a small minority. Since I came to the University (1927), only one economist has been appointed who could be classified as really a traditional liberal (he, at an age when cure might still be anticipated); and one (the only fellow I ever found eminently useful as a colleague) was fired simply because of his uncompromising, competent profession of that political-economic philosophy. Meantime, many appointments have been made to the divisional economics staff; and a large staff, overwhelmingly hostile to economic liberalism, has been built up for the College courses in social science. Then, too, we acquired the Cowles Commission and its staff—whose influence the proposed Institute might partially neutralize or offset. Finally, there are our new agricultural economists who, while sympathetic, are real libertarians only avocationally.\n\nWithin the large department, there are now Knight, Mints, Viner, myself, and Lewis (in order of age). Knight will soon reach retirement age; Mints is not far behind; and Lewis, long frequently on leave, may well be attracted elsewhere. Moreover, Knight and Viner, while the best of libertarians, can hardly be called members of our group. Knight is increasingly preoccupied with the philosophy and philosophers, not to mention historians, theologians, anthropologists, et al., and is not deeply interested in concrete problems of economic policy. And Viner, while eminently useful to us as Journal editor, seems increasingly to dissociate himself both by interests outside economics and by very special preoccupations in his own writing and research. That leaves Mints and Simons to talk with and to stimulate one another, and to represent libertarian economics on the main teaching front—along with Lewis when he is here. (Viner and Knight teach only quite advanced courses and, even at that level, reach most of the students only in courses which stress technical matters, not political philosophy or political economy.)\n\nOn the other hand, our socialist and Keynesian colleagues are friendly and unusually tolerant toward us; and the others are not so much opposed to our political persuasions as simply uninterested—politically neutral or agnostic. It is a group which would be mainly friendly and cooperative with the Institute and its guests; it would doubtless welcome cordially most of the people whom the Institute would propose as visitors, and be happy to use the Institute occasionally for looking over possible appointees. No hostility would be likely to arise if the Institute was properly handled (for its own purposes) and if its resources were moderate.\n\nLet me now formulate more concrete proposals.\n\n(1) The Institute should be projected for roughly a 20-year period.\n\n(2) It should have a permanent head (Aaron Director) with a salary of $7,500—the only person for whom the Institute would hold out permanent, full-time, professional employment.\n\n(3) It should occupy a suite of three or four rooms at 1313 East 60th Street—or, like the Cowles Commission, on the campus—one for the director, one for a secretary-stenographer (or two?) and one for its visiting economists.\n\n(4) It should plan to have one visiting economist (or political scientist, if libertarian ones can be found) on the ground all the time (save for its vacation periods)—and more than one if and as joint appointments and joint financing with the University are arranged.\n\n(5) Finances permitting, it might grant a few fellowships (of, say, $1,000-$1,500) for the advanced training (or refresher training) of persons teaching economics at other institutions, or of interested practicing bureaucrats and journalists.\n\n(6) It might also occasionally bring in outsiders for specific projects of writing and/or research—or assist them in completing publishing work done elsewhere.\n\n(7) It would be highly desirable to have, in addition to the permanent head, a permanent half-time economic statistician, if arrangements could be made for joint appointment, with some department or school of the University, of a suitable person (e.g., Mr. Milton Friedman).\n\n(8) In addition to one or two stenographer-secretaries, generous budgetary provision should be made for peak-load typing and for mimeographing of the manuscripts of economists affiliated with the Institute.\n\n(9) These tentative proposals contemplate a budget of $20,000-$40,000 per year. A start could be made with less than $20,000, and more than $40,000 could easily be utilized effectively; but I distrust munificent arrangements. The important thing financially is assurance of continuity for a considerable period; but, again, I should urge against initial provision for more than 20-25 years. All this implies endowment of $300,000-$600,000—or assurance that funds of that (initial) present value will be steadily available.\n\nThe Institute should be set up, not as part of the University of Chicago but independently, with its own governing body and its own funds. It should be located at Chicago, however, only after reasonable assurance of close and friendly relations with the University; and it should be free to move elsewhere if effective or fruitful cooperation later proves unattainable here. The University might undertake to handle Institute funds; it should extend full use of facilities like the Library to the Institute’s director and its guests; it should offer facilities for lectures and seminars sponsored by the Institute; and it should undertake, when feasible, to make temporary (and perhaps one permanent ) joint appointments, so that guests of the Institute might also commonly serve also as members of the faculty. Close administrative cooperation and consultation should be continuously maintained. Cooperation, however, should be achieved largely through individuals, rather than by formal organizational connections.\n\nThe Institute should be designed primarily to promote cooperation and communication among competent economists of a traditional-liberal persuasion. It should aim to make such economists more cohesive and more articulate as a group. Its primary concern should be that of contributing to professional discussion and publication at the highest professional level, not that of popularizing or of propagandizing at a mass level. It may be hoped that such publication of popular or semi-popular books and articles would incidentally come about; and some direct efforts to this end would be appropriate. The Institute should seek to focus attention, not only on general economic-political philosophy, but largely on real, concrete problems and issues of public policy. It should, however, adhere firmly to a long and large view of policy, seeking not to influence immediate political action but to improve the quality of discussion of immediate matters. It should largely ignore considerations of immediate political expediency, seeking by discussion to influence professional opinion and thus perhaps to determine what will much later become politically feasible.\n\nThe director might properly occupy himself considerably with projects of non-technical writing on major policy problems. He might occasionally arrange for symposium publications, or for a series of special studies, with subsequent summary publications, for a wide audience. In the main, however, the director should be simply one member like others in an academic-intellectual community, contributing his share of talks and manuscripts to the common pool for mutual stimulation and criticism. Like others, moreover, he should publish mainly as an individual.\n\nThere are presumably plenty of agencies for publishing and disseminating good popular books and tracts. The Institute might quietly call attention to such writings of libertarian economists as might appeal to other organization; and it might occasionally subsidize or “undisclosedly enterprise” good publications which fail to find other outlets. In the main, however, it should seek to promote work which, when ready for publication, will readily attract commercial publishers. Its subsidies should be largely confined to unusual manuscripts which promise important contribution to professional discussion but do not promise commercially adequate sales.\n\nThe Institute, avoiding publicity, should be frank about its purposes and about its ideological position. Its director, its governing board, and all of its consulting or affiliated economists should be chosen as ardent, confirmed free traders—as anti-collectivists, anti-syndicalists, anti-“Planners”—as advocates of free foreign and free domestic trade, of non-discriminatory commercial policies, of untied, non-governmental foreign lending, of deorganization of functional groups, of deconcentration of economic power, of decentralization in national government, of impairment of national sovereignty (through supra-national organization), of devolution of central government powers (in favor of provisional and local powers); i.e., as advocates of systematic and progressive dispersion of power, nationally and internationally. They should be proponents of rigid economy in the kinds of governmental control or intervention—yet more concerned to minimize the kinds than the aggregate amount, and more concerned about minimizing the amount in large or central governments than in local and provincial bodies. Their central credo, following Acton and de Tocqueville, should be that no large organization can be trusted with, or wisely permitted, much power. They should be zealous proponents of the rule of law, of rules of policy as against legislative nose following, and of minimal delegations of discretionary authority. In a word, they should be confirmed constitutional-federalists in the strict sense.\n\nThat such an Institute would serve its proper or original purposes cannot be assured for a long period. It can be reasonably assured for (say) twenty years only by the most careful selection of personnel. One can trust Aaron Director to serve such purposes faithfully and intelligently. One can so trust Friedrick [sic] Hayek, Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, Lloyd Mints, Gregg Lewis, Theodore Yntema, Theodore Schultz, Garfield Cox, Wilber Katz, Quincy Wright, Ronald Crane and, to mention some persons elsewhere, Friedrick [sic] Lutz, Herbert Stein, Leland Bach, George Stigler, Allan Wallis, Howard Ellis, Frank Dunston Graham, Frank A. (and Frank W.) Fetter, Harry G. Brown, Joseph Davis, Karl Brandt, Leo Wolman, William A. Paton, Clare Griffin, I. L. Sharfman, Leverett S. Lyon, Milton Friedman, Arthur F. Burns, Gottfried Haberler, Eugene Rostow, Lionel Robbins, Fredrick Bonham, Henry Clay, R. G. Hawtrey, T. E. Gregory, Arnold Plant, A. J. Baster, Colin Clark, Roland Wilson, Harold A. Innis, Carl S. Shoup, James W. Angell, Thurman Arnold, Harry D. Gideonse, Reginald Arragon, Albert G. Hart, John M. Clark and, among prominent business men, William Clayton, and, among journalists, Walter Lippman, John Davenport, and Sir Walter Layton. Many others might be named, and some of those named above could be fully trusted only as members of an otherwise well-selected company.\n\nAaron Director is not only the ideal person to head the Institute; he is available and would be willing to undertake the task even at financial sacrifice (which he should not be expected to make). He probably would accept the modest stipend compatible with a properly modest and unobtrusive organization. No serious problem should arise in recruiting an able and reliable governing body or a fairly sizable company of conscientious, interested economist-participants or sponsors.\n\nThe Institute, to repeat, should not be designed primarily or explicitly as an agency for preparing tracts or reports. It should not be mainly concerned with formal economic theory; neither should it engage substantially in empirical research. It should focus on central, practical problems of American economic policy and governmental structure. It should afford a center to which economist liberals everywhere may look for intellectual leadership or support. It should seek to influence affairs mainly through influencing professional opinion and by preserving at least one place where some political economists of the future may be thoroughly and competently trained along traditional-liberal lines. Money for such causes is perhaps not hard to get and is very easy to spend wastefully or harmfully. In the project here suggested, I can see little danger of miscarriage and real promise of very good results.\n\n______________________\n\nMemo from Merrill Mead Parvis [?] to Hutchins and Colwell\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\n\nDate: June 14, 1945\n\nR.M.H. [Robert M. Hutchins]\n\nE.C.C. [Ernest Cadman Colwell, President of the University of Chicago from 1945 to 1951]\n\nIn re Hayek à la Simons\n\nThere is an element of fear in Mr. Simons’ presentation of the true faith in economics. It sounds very familiar to me. It weakens any enthusiasm I may have had for the Hayek project. When it is seriously suggested that the staff for the institute should be drawn from men already so old that there is no risk of any ideas entering their heads, the cause must be in precarious condition indeed. Instead of the title that Mr. Simons suggests, I would suggest “asylum for laissez faire economists.”\n\nIn the second place, it seems to me that Mr. Simons takes all the vigor out of the proposal: It should not do serious research; it should not produce books that would influence public opinion; but it should aim at being a small, social, intellectual community, effecting contacts and influencing professional opinion. There is an element of dilettantism in this whole proposal, as I read it, that makes it sound like the laissez faire economists dinner club.\n\nThe statement of its relationship to the University seems to me to be a very simple one, not altogether desirable. The institute would be a pressure and propaganda group on the edge of the University entirely outside the University’s control, organized for the purpose of forcing or leading the University to appoint orthodox economists. None of this sounds very good for the University to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[signed]\n\n[Guess: Merrill Mead Parvis (1906-1983), colleague of Ernest Cadman Colwell, Chicago Ph.D. 1944, appointed associate professor of New Testament at Emory.

A graduate of Emory University, he received his PhD from the Divinity School at Chicago in 1930. He served on the faculty of the Divinity School from 1930 to 1951.

What has happened to this scheme?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nROBERT M. HUTCHINS\n\nMr. Henry Simons\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\n______________________\n\n(Late) Reply to Hutchins by Simons\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\n\nDate: September 4, 1945\n\nChancellor R. M. Hutchins\n\nFrom: Henry C. Simons [,] Economics [Department]\n\nI am not remiss in telling you about the Hayek project, for there still is no further news. I have heard nothing from Hayek since he was here—which suggests either that he didn’t like my memos or that he has been preoccupied, possibly as a consultant on the treatment of Germany. Probably something unexpected has happened, for others have heard nothing from him; he is usually more than polite and “correct” about correspondence.\n\nThe memos and their scheme, however, were obviously not well contrived to get money from his particular “angel.” I had hopes that they just might be otherwise useful. Now that Sociology and Political Science are going into economics on their own, some scheme like mine is really needed as a counterpoise—not to mention E.H. Carr!\n\nI’m taking the liberty of enclosing copy of a recent memo. [Not found in this file] Let’s hope it is not too irregular to do so, and that you will not be annoyed by passages which, at worst, were not intended to annoy you. Sending copy to you is an afterthought.\n\n[signed, HCS]\n\nHCS-w\n\nP.S. A letter has just come from Hayek. Copy will go to you when it has been deciphered.\n\n______________________\n\n[Carbon copy]\n\nHutchins’ Reply to Simons\n\nSeptember 10, 1945\n\nDear Henry:\n\nI understand from the angel that Hayek has submitted another program, which has no relation to economics.\n\nWhat is the matter with E. H. Carr? I take few exceptions to your memorandum on Economics. My most important one is the implication that the Department is engaged in a bitter struggle with the administration to secure its just desserts. The administration would like nothing better than to make as many first-class appointments in Economics as the Department can prove are first-class.\n\nThe implication that the administration has put on pressure for “less good” appointments will prevent the administration from passing on without comment suggestions which it receives from reputable quarters. The suggestion of Stocking came from Edward H. Levi and was sent to Mr. Leland with no comments except those of Mr. Levi.\n\nThere is a kind of particularistic flavor about these suggestions for developments in connection with the Cowles Commission, the Law School, and possibly the School of Business, which imply that these are in the central field, whereas Industrial Relations, Agricultural Economics, Political Science and Planning, and possibly American Economic History are not. Some day I want you to explain to me why some of these areas are central and others are ancillary.\n\nBut what I started out to say was that I am glad that you are thinking about and pushing for the development of Economics in the University.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nROBERT M. HUTCHINS\n\nMr. Henry C. Simons\n\nSocial Science 516\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\n______________________\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nOctober 6, 1945\n\nChancellor Robert M. Hutchins\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\nDear Mr. Hutchins:\n\nYour good letter of September 10th was forwarded to me on vacation; hence the tardiness of this reply.\n\nI share most of your disagreements with me! That memo was written for a small group of immediate colleagues—not hypocritically, I hope, but with “slants” that others might easily misinterpret.\n\nI certainly have not felt that the Department is engaged in a bitter struggle with the administration to secure its just desserts. Neither do I object to the passing along of suggestions from reputable quarters. (Levi’s suggestion, by the way, was not without merit, if interpreted as part of his proposal for a large-scale local project in anti-trust investigation.) I was complaining about departmental policy or practice of making no longer-range proposals for recruitment and replacement—not about suggestions coming down to us but about the dearth of suggestions going up.\n\nThe Department, I think, should submit to the administration, not only recommendations for immediate, urgent appointments but also a “waiting list,” subject always to revision, of several men whom we definitely want if and when the administration is prepared to act on them. The administration might then make careful, unhurried outside inquiries; and, when outside suggestions are received, we might discuss and report on the relative merits of particular appointments and invite your inquiry on the same basis. Thus the waiting list or appointment program might be kept more or less continuously under critical discussion.\n\nOn that matter of what is central and what is ancillary, I think I have an important point, although I might have trouble stating it clearly or persuasively. The point, moreover, is one on which I would anticipate support from you.\n\nAbout E. H. Carr, I am too strongly and deeply prejudiced for judicious comment. I have seldom reacted so strongly against a book as against his The Conditions of Peace—which is the only Carr book I have read. Knowing nothing of his work on Dostoevski or Bakunin, however, I would have less reason to oppose the appointment if it were in the proposed Russian Institute than if it were in Political Science and International Relations.\n\nMy objections to Carr are largely ideological. The Conditions of Peace is a powerful book, very well written and admirable in many parts and aspects. But it is largely and deeply concerned with economics and commercial policy; and here my criticism involves more than bitter disagreement; for here, I think, the fellow is using his rhetorical, journalistic skill to cover up his own lack of insight and understanding. One should not expect all students of politics to discuss economic problems competently. But one may object to their writing arrogantly, caustically, and demagogically about men, books, and subjects that they do not understand.\n\nThis book, I think, is one of the outstanding anti-Liberal documents of its time, not only as regards economic policy, domestic and international but also as regards the rights of small nations and their proper place or role in the good society. Carr personifies, for me, almost everything that is wrong with political thinking at both the extreme Right and the extreme Left.\n\nIt is significant, I think, that Carr has earned the most bitter denunciation of two such different people as Hayek and Keynes. (Don’t quote me as regards Keynes, for my information is somewhat privileged in that case and second-hand; but I believe it may easily be confirmed.) At best, Carr is a very hot potato in present-day politics—much too hot for wise University appointment, even if one approved of his views.\n\nI should be more diffident about my own reactions to Carr if those of J. Viner and Q. Wright (and Louiee Wright) were not much the same. Incidentally, what is distinctive about Carr (tough political “realism”) is, I think, already adequately represented here, and competently, by Morgenthau.\n\nI’ll be happy to talk sometime about what is central what is ancillary—or as happy as I can be when trying to talk philosophically,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[signed] Henry Simons\n\nHenry C.

My scheme thus requires raiding the Minnesota staff for two men, within a few years. Moreover, it might now be best, under that scheme, to get Stigler first.\n\nSource: University of Chicago Archives. Office of the President. Hutchins Administration Records.
