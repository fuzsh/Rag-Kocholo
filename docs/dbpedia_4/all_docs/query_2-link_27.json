        "text": "New Zealand basketball player, Paora Winitana, shares his faith in a blog post and video on Mormon.org.\n\n\"I come from a small town on the east coast of New Zealand. As a family we didn't have much growing up so we learnt to appreciate the little things such as the love between family, hard work and respect, making the most of what you have and enjoying life every single day.\"\n\n\"I started playing basketball because of my friends and at first I was the worst player ever. They would invite me to church youth activities held during the week, and thats where it all began for me. Our small local chapel is where I not only learnt how to play the sport, but fell in love with game of basketball.\"\n\n\"After serving a 2 year mission for my church I married my true love, my high school sweet heart in the New Zealand Temple and now we have 3 beautiful boys. Basketball is a big part of my life but its not who I am, its what I do. My family is my greatest asset and my greatest responsibility, I love them more than anything!\"\n\nRead the entire blog post at Mormon.org.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;"
