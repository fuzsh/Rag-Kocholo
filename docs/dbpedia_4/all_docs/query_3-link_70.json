The purpose of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated is to: • Promote or assist the education of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi • Promote the custody and preservation of the beliefs, customs and language of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi • Promote the social and economic welfare advancement and vocational training of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi • Promote personal, whänau and community health and wellbeing and raise the living standards of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi • Promote high quality communications to and for the benefit of the members of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Strategic Objectives In September 2001 consultation with whänau throughout the rohe of Kahungunu occurred. Whänau shared their views, aspirations and desires which helped shape the development of a vision to guide Ngäti Kahungunu into the future. The vision, known as Kahungunu 2026, outlines the vision and mission statements and seven identified strategic objectives to focus on. The Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated planning framework continues to outline priorities, activities and desired outcomes that link directly to the seven strategic objectives within the Kahungunu 2026 vision. The seven strategic objectives are: • Ngäti Kahungunu - Culturally Strong • Ngäti Kahungunu - Healthy and Vibrant Whänau • Ngäti Kahungunu - Economically Strong • Ngäti Kahungunu - Informed and Participating Citizens in the World • Ngäti Kahungunu - Independent and Self Determined • Ngäti Kahungunu - Healthy, Thriving and Sustainable Environment • Ngäti Kahungunu - Making our Mark Vision Statement “Kahungunu - ki te whaiao, ki te ao märama” Achieving excellence in all areas of our lives Mission Statement Kia maumahara ki te mana ähua ake o Ngäti Kahungunu Uphold the absolute uniqueness of the living breath of Kahungunu “To enhance the mana and well-being of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi” Reporting Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated has an obligation to provide an ‘Annual Report’ for its membership to account for the previous financial year 1 July 2018 – 30 June 2019. This document provides a summary report against the objectives set out in the 2018-2019 Annual Plan. It includes steps taken to increase the registration database and gives an overview of the organisation’s performance, including changes in the value of its assets, profit distribution and the summary financial statements. Page 1 Chairperson’s Report HE MANAKO TE KOURA I KORE AI The 2018 – 2019 year has been a clunky year for the iwi with self-imposed timelines on investments and relationships that have driven us to new heights of engagements but also realising long-term ambitions as prescribed in our 25-year vision. A 30-year-old moemoeä was to hold the total business and activity of fisheries by restoration of our whakapapa with Tangaroa. Another ambition was to ensure that as an iwi, then as hapü and then as whänau, we be economically sustainable and independent of government hence follow a mana motuhake model of development and aspiration. HE KURA TE MOKOPUNA – TIAKINA! The re-engagement with whänau outside the arena of fabulous iconic events has been a key driver throughout this year. The commissioning of high performance executives from government agencies in situ with the iwi office has been part of the strategy to have the intellectual and institutional capacity that have been the preserve of those agencies in the past ready to support whänau kaupapa in real time. The traumatic events surrounding the attempted child uplift in Hastings was quickly managed by community members, leaders and supported by our internal capacity which was fortuitous in the first instance and revealing in its unfolding. To this end our relationship with Ministers of the Crown now become a vital part of our political machinery. TAI TIMU, TAI PARI This was an election year, therefore much time was consumed in registrations, profiling and ensuring that every registered member had access and an ability to vote for their respective candidates. The election result cast new faces to our board, namely, Brian Ruawai-Hamilton for Taura Here, Melissa Ihaka from Wairarapa, Waiora Rogers from Heretaunga and Nigel How from Wairoa. We acknowledge the efforts and contributions of Noeline Smiler, Marama Tuuta, Mike Paku, and Alice Wairau in their unwavering hard work to promote and secure iwi kaupapa. MÄ TE HURUHURU TE MANU KA RERE Our financial position is ahead of our predicted deficit and acknowledgements to the financial and audit committee for bringing the year in under budget. We do now have the internal capacity to monitor and do internal audits which we did not have previously and external relationships are requiring us to have even greater line of sight on our economics as we progress. ME UPOKO PAKARU The Kahungunu Asset Holding Company (KAHC) has realised an iwi dream with the purchase of Hawke’s Bay Seafoods, now known as Takitimu Seafoods, which has taken intensive negotiations, determination and stamina throughout this complex period. During this time as well, our partners in Tautäne, Taratahi collapsed into receivership so there have been intensive negotiations with the receivers to ensure our assets, both tangible and financial, were safeguarded throughout the demise of Taratahi. Apart from that, Tautäne and KAHC have not been affected. Although Kahutia was launched with much nervousness, it is now showing signs of great potential for cultural, environmental and economical outcomes. NGÄ WHAKAIHUWAKA To execute all of the above activities with a tightknit core of explosive and energetic staff has again been an eye opener for all and sundry and I commend our tari for their unrelenting efforts in the pursuit of iwi goals and visions. It is my pleasure to present this report as your newly re-elected Chair. TIHEI KAHUNGUNU! Ngahiwi Tomoana Page 2 Tumuaki - Chairman Chief Executive’s Statement Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, engari he toa takitini Our strength does not come from ourselves alone, our strength derives from the many. When I look back over the last 12 months this whakatauäkï encapsulates how; with the support and commitment of our community and government partners, whänau, marae, hapü and Taiwhenua; and through the leadership and guidance of our Board; the 10 FTEs of our iwi tari have navigated through adversity, advocated for, advanced and enact the aspirations of our whänau and our 25 year vision. Each of our staff are exemplars within their field of expertise – ka mihi ahau i tö rätau kaha, i tö rätau mäia me tä rätau ü ki te iwi. The capacity and capability of the Iwi tari to deliver has also been enhanced through secondments from our central government partners. This resource is a recognition of the strong partnerships Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi has with our central government partners i.e. Te Puni Kökiri, Ministry of Social Development, Oranga Tamariki, Department of Corrections, Ministry of Education, Te Mätäwai. Focus is on strengthening the approach towards the Ngäti Kahungunu Toiora strategy and our collective common outcomes. This alongside the strength and knowledge of Te Tumu Whakahaere o te Wero, our community partners and champions, and our Taiwhenua we are well placed for the coming 12 months. There have also been many twists and turns which we as a Tari and as a Board have had to respond to and advocate clearly our positon as an Iwi, and as whänau. The quality and access to our water, the state of our whenua, the revitalisation of our Reo, the advocacy of our stories and our history are but some of the work that is championed by our Directors within the Tari and captured within their report. The agreed restoration of Te Mata o Rongokako and the establishment of Te Rongo Park Trust has ensured that Mana Whenua are at the decision making table and our tïpuna will be protected for future generations. The establishment of Kahutia is a direct response to the korero around the degradation of our waterways, whenua and moana. Kahutia focuses on the planting of exotics and restoration of native plantings on marginal land to stem erosion, and siltation. While still in its initial phase I look forward to the opportunities that will come from Kahutia. Iwi Build Summit held in May 2019; brought the impact of the housing crisis and the resulting concerns of our whänau to the forefront. Through our partnerships; co-led with Hastings District Council, we are developing a place based housing solution for the Hastings District which will be submitted to Cabinet later this year. This is supported by the National Iwi Chairs Forum and will be considered as a model for other Iwi and communities to follow. The attempted uplift by Oranga Tamariki was a tearful reminder of the adverse effect of Crown systems on whänau and the fabric of our whakapapa. The need to be diligent and steadfast in our commitment to whänau was demonstrated by our community champions Jean Te Huia, Ripeka Ormsby and Des Ratima. This and the resulting statement by our Chairman “Not one more baby…” has cast the lens on these systems and policies both within government and by Iwi/Mäori. Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi remain committed to working with Oranga Tamariki to support a resolution and change in these systems and uphold the retention of whakapapa and whänau. Page 3 Chief Executive’s Statement The opening of E Hine Therapeutic Centre administered by Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga is a positive step towards the outcomes sought under the Whakaritenga Pähekoheko Kawenata with Department of Corrections. This work and the Hökai Rangi strategy launched by the Minister for Corrections Hon Kelvin Davis is a direct result of Uncle Tom Hemopo’s unwavering advocacy and the Tü Mai Rangi report by the Waitangi Tribunal. The acquisition of Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership in April is a major step forward to the realisation of a 30 year aspiration of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi and shifts us from a passive to an active player in this sector. The launch itself brought together all the major players in the Seafood industry all voicing support to Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi; not more so than Kïngi Tüheitia Pötatau Te Wherowhero VII himself who graced us attending and cutting the ribbon. Takitimu Seafoods, like any other new business is still working through its “storming and forming” phase however, Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi see this as a long term investment; one which will provide employment, training for our people and influence positive change within the sector. Over the last 6 months our Chairman has facilitated a number of workshops to equip and inspire Mäori to step up in the coming local body and District Health Board elections. These were held right across the Kahungunu rohe and well supported. I congratulate all those that have taken up the ‘wero’. Finally; I wanted to acknowledge all those that stepped forward in our Iwi elections. Nearly every position was well contested. Ka mau te wehi! Näu te rourou, Näku te rourou, Ka ora te iwi!

The iwi has built relationships with regional and national government agencies to increase opportunities for secondments to work unitedly towards achieving outcomes for whänau development. Errol Kalmancsi is the Offender Recruitment Consultant (ORC) for the Department of Corrections in partnership with Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi. Errol works with employers who are willing to give men and women who have been imprisoned the opportunity for employment. It’s a tough task, but Errol remains positive and works tirelessly to strengthen ties with key people who believe in change. Errol attends almost every staff meeting to give his updates, otherwise he works outside of the office all week. Tracee Te Huia is the Kahutia Accord Programme Director. Kahutia Limited Partnership is a newly formed Company set up by Ngäti Kahungunu through carbon sequestration and reforestation including planting indigenous trees to earn carbon credits. Tawehi Munro is a secondee from the Ministry of Education and has taken on the role of Mätauranga Project Manager within the Te Reo, Tikanga and Mätauranga Directorship. Tawehi’s role includes assessing our relationship with the Ministry of Education and focusing on mutual priorities that will benefit whänau, hapü, iwi. Shade Smith started in December 2018 as the Senior Analyst for the Environment and Natural Resources Unit working alongside Unit Director Ngaio Tiuka to undertake analysis and research to provide quality advice to support and protect the Ngäti Kahungunu environment. Tangi-Jean Mihaere started as the Executive Assistant in March 2019. In her role she provides all secretarial and administrative services that support the Chairperson, Chief Executive and the Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated Board. We would like to acknowledge the previous Executive Assistant, Kate Karaka who worked with the organisation for the past two and a half years. In February Kate took up a new career with Housing New Zealand. Rawinia Lewis is a secondee from the Ministry of Social Development. She started working with the iwi on 4 June 2019. Her role as Senior Advisor will be to provide opportunities for better housing solutions for whänau and seek out potential training options that will lead whänau to more sustainable employment. Amuri Te Huia is a secondee from Oranga Tamariki. Her role as Senior Advisor is to develop a strategic partnership agreement for early prevention and intensive interventions for Kahungunu whänau. Collectively Rawinia and Amuri have a wider brief to work with other government agencies to apply a ‘Systems Thinking’ approach across the social sector to build an evidenced approach that is whänau centric, holistic and enables agencies to better respond to our whänau needs in a joined-up way. Taasha Romana commenced on 12 August 2019 as the interim Programme Manager to support Te Kähui Öhanga o Takitimu (TKOT) under the umbrella of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated.

Jeremy Tätere MacLeod Pouarataki – Director, Te Reo, Tikanga me Mätauranga Te Reo Symposium that hosted Page 11 over 1,000 language enthusiasts. Environment & Natural Resources Over the last 12 months we have seen a number of significant changes within Ngäti Kahungunu of particular relevance to the mahi within te taiao me öna rawa. There has been a substantial investment in fisheries, in both processing and deep sea trawling, which in turn places greater emphasis on ensuring that the iwi’s social, environmental, cultural and economic bottom lines are sound and that environmental sustainability for Ngäti Kahungunu is paramount. Growth has also literally taken place in the form of trees and through iwi wänanga with Robert ‘Pa’ McGowan. These wänanga are a key cog of the Kahutia Accord, led by Tracee Te Huia, which has the ambitious goal of re-cloaking the whenua and in so doing removing carbon dioxide from the air. The Crown’s negotiated settlements and ongoing relationships with its Treaty Partners while growing in terms of attention and rhetoric are challenged to change outcomes and share actual power. Thereby shifting towards true recognition and provision of tangata whenua culture and traditions. This places greater emphasis on Mäori/iwi/hapü groups working together to force change, promote indigenous solutions and to avoid negative and paternal influences. Key Kahungunu Taiao Goals • Advocate for Ngäti Kahungunu objectives and values to be incorporated into natural resource decision making and policy development in local, regional and central government. • Complete a review of the Kahungunu Ki Uta, Kahungunu Ki Tai Strategic Plan. • Support hapü to progress hapü management plans to enhance their role as Kaitiaki of natural resources. • Develop quality relationships with organisations to assist us to achieve our natural resource objectives which help to build the capacity and capabilities of our people. In September 2019 the Waitangi Tribunal released its Stage Two Report on the National Freshwater and Geothermal Claim. Ngäti Kahungunu and a number of hapü were parties to this claim and provided evidence and submissions. The findings were that the present law is in breach of the Treaty, not consistent with its principles and that Mäori interests have too often been balanced out altogether in freshwater decision-making. The recommendations are for stronger environmental protection, recognition for wetlands, estuaries and aquifers; effective control of nutrients; power sharing and greater weight to iwi and hapü management plans. The Government has also recently released a number of discussion documents including ‘Essential Freshwater - Healthy Water Fairly Allocated’ outlining their proposed approach to freshwater management. While, not without fault, it is a significant improvement and would mean local Councils would be forced to do more. This includes providing a hierarchy for management centred on health and wellbeing, where the health of the awa comes first, then essential human needs like drinking water comes second, and other needs third. Also, strengthening the requirement to identify and reflect Mäori values in freshwater planning, such as providing mahinga kai1 as a compulsory objective. Incorporating better direction into local level resource management couldn’t come soon enough. Advocating for whanau, hapü and iwi values and interests is a significant undertaking for the Taiao Unit, as kaitiaki, whänau and hapü organisations are forced to engage in a predominantly western framework of management. In the last 12 months there has been a significant increase in collaboration with our Taiwhenua and a number of the Ngäti Kahungunu settlement groups due in part to the 1 Species, place and practice. Page 12 Environment & Natural Resources growing issues, needs and awareness. An example is the view that a majority of waterways (at least in Hawke’s Bay) are mismanaged. Greater tangata whenua involvement in ‘Catchment Plans’ is a critical component to solving this; through sharing the whakapapa, püräkau, and stories of our waterways. This evidence is needed now to protect the Tutaekurï, Ngäruroro, Karamu, Te Whanganui-a-Örotu (Ahuriri whanga), and the Heretaunga aquifer. Get ready Mohaka and Wairoa whänau as development of these catchment plans for your awa are not far away. In terms of Tangaroa, the Taiao unit has submitted on Fisheries NZ, MPI ‘sustainability reviews’ - requesting greater use of selective fishing gear to allow juveniles to escape and improving environmental sustainability. Including turned mesh (T90) code ends for Tarakihi, whose populations along or near the Kahungunu coastline are reportedly very low. The iwi supports and is actively involved in progressing further research into ‘sustainable fishing’ technology. Ngäti Kahungunu was also instrumental in preventing the commercial catch for crayfish from increasing, our position is precautionary due to the record sea surface temperatures, climate change and difficulties in fishing. Ngäti Kahungunu again called for a moratorium on commercial fishing of long fin eels and a specific Tuna plan in Kahungunu led by tangata whenua. Interests and concerns regarding tuna are strong across Kahungunu, the intolerance to commercial eeling is growing. The Crown, reduced the commercial catch by 5 tonnes, setting it at 13 tonnes, while maintaining the allowances for ‘Customary Mäori fishing’ and ‘recreational fishing’ at 6 and 5 tonnes respectively. The iwi does not commercially fish eels. Kaitiaki from Moteo Marae, found hundreds of eels dying in the sun away from the awa due to Council drain clearing practices. As a consequence, ourselves, hapü, kaitiaki and council helped develop new operating procedures, with some guidance from Te Waimäori Trust. Long-term we envisage better practices across Kahungunu and local kaitiaki resourced to monitor these practices. Hawke’s Bay East Coast Conservation Management Strategy has resumed development. This is an important guide to a working relationship between DOC and tangata whenua. We also congratulate Jenny Nelson-Smith who was appointed as the new operations manager in Napier, Jenny has a strong relationship with Ngäti Kahungunu. The iwi supported hapü in their opposition to Whirinaki based PanPac’s resource consent to discharge 15M L/day of wastewater into the moana. Despite improvements being made in terms of greater recognition of tangata whenua interests the ultimate objective to prohibit the discharge is a significant work in progress for hapü and the iwi. The Taiao unit also supports Te Whanganui-a-Örotu hapü and their representatives on the Port of Napier’s Mana Whenua Steering Kömiti who are in the process of developing a Marine Cultural Health Monitoring programme that is on track to be implemented within the next 12 months. The significant offence against Te Mata o Rongokako provided a wake- up call in terms of the protections or lack thereof afforded to our most significant sites. However, the opportunity to learn from this costly hara, has been progressed with plenty of knowledgeable tangata whenua providing feedback to Hastings District Council. To help understand the pressures on, and state of, our environment and possible sustainable solution, the iwi has agreed to support or partner with research institutions to apply for funding on potential research projects. Current collaborative research projects include 1) Sea level rise – studying the impacts on rivers and estuary mahinga kai, 2) Aquifer research, including modelling of water age using isotopes, and how mätauranga Page 13 Environment & Natural Resources Mäori can be incorporated into these scientific models - Heretaunga Taiwhenua are planning wänanga with whänau to try and flesh out how this will be done 3) Braided Rivers, investigating their changes and (potentially improving) their connections to recharge aquifer water. Research projects we currently support includes: coastal archaeology excavations before they succumb to coastal erosion; natives being planted under vines to prevent evaporation and need for weed spray. The newly created Waikahu Wetland near Waitangi Estuary finished its earthworks and flooding has commenced. This is another collaboration with hapü, Councils, Te Waimäori Trust and others to get this relatively large coastal wetland off the ground. The iwi has and will continue to advocate for an improved and more directive legal framework to manage the environment at the national level while ensuring meaningful implementation at the local level. Going forward the iwi has been exploring other complementary initiatives and tools towards solutions including: • Research that aligns with our values and interests towards better management that recognises our culture and traditions. Fish Hook Summit 2019 Page 14 Environment & Natural Resources • Monitoring to ensure the management is appropriate and that tangata whenua are part of regular official reporting. • Resourcing from government agencies for kaitiaki and kaimahi that is meaningful and doesn’t compromise our independence but recognises our expertise and skills in a meaningful and consistent manner across Ngäti Kahungunu. In December 2018, Senior Analyst Shade Smith of Te Aupöuri and Te Rarawa joined the Taiao unit on a part time basis. Shade has a background in Marine Science and freshwater ecology – running his own consultancy for the last 10 years. Shade is a welcome asset to Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated, providing expert advice on a number of environmental issues. Lastly, in May 2019 the new Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated Board were designated roles. Nigel How holds the Taiao portfolio as well as being the Board Representative and Chair of the Wairoa Taiwhenua. Nigel brings a wealth of knowledge and experience and vital governance support and insight for the challenges ahead. Ngaio Tiuka Pouarataki – Director, Te Taiao me öna Rawa Page 15 Benefits to Members SMART SERVICES The Smart Services team is a dynamic group of individuals who work well together to ensure that all iwi activities are planned, lead, organised, communicated and managed in an efficient way. This year we have focused on using our online tools to improve the way we communicate and inform our members. We are now fully cloud based and have new tools that can be used from anywhere in the world. We have migrated from a Microsoft Access Registration to a cloud based SQL (structured query language) database which allows us to produce more comprehensive reports to assist our people. COMMUNICATIONS Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated continues to take pride in the way we communicate with our registered iwi members, our potential members, other iwi networks and with the public in general. The whole purpose of communicating well is to ensure everyone knows who we are and why we exist. We are pleased with the volume of new registrations that has enabled us to communicate with over 2500 new members. Throughout the year we have continued to communicate using tools such as facebook, our iwi website, the pänui ki te iwi email network, advertisements in newspapers, Tihei Kahungunu our 8-12 page Kahungunu newspaper which features everything and anything we want to promote and share with the wider public. Our website has become the best portal for registering whänau to attend events. This online tool has made the process easier to manage. Application forms and expressions of interest for almost all events and activities are now available online. Our next step is to encourage a more interactive registration website where whänau will be able to update their own information. REGISTRATIONS Over the year we have registered 2529 new members. This is an overwhelming amount of people considering the capacity in our tari. Kerrin Fair has been very busy working with a small team of interns to help input the data. As at 30 June 2019 our iwi membership total was 32,377. This increase is mainly due to the Iwi Benefit to Member Card initiative. Whänau members who have received a card feel connected, happy and grateful to be Kahungunu. BENEFIT TO MEMBERS IWI MEMBERSHIP CARD Two years ago we introduced the Iwi Benefit to Member Card. The purpose of the card is to first create pride in belonging to your iwi, secondly it is an opportunity to access benefits such as free or discounted entrance to major iwi hosted events, access to scholarships, sponsorships, kai hau kai, food vouchers and so forth. In April 2019 Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated purchased Takitimu Seafoods. One of the benefits to members is a 15% discount on fresh fish. We also have a relationship with Star Foods and Iwi Member Card holders can get a 5% discount. We continue to value our relationship with Simplicity Funeral Services which we launched in February 2018. Over 100 families have taken advantage of the Simplicity Kahungunu Funeral package. The iwi continues to seek opportunities to benefit our members and help support whänau and hapü development. Tihei Kahungunu Ruth Wong Pouarataki – Director, Smart Services & Communications Advisor Page 16 Benefits to Members EVENTS Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated strives to produce and sponsor events that strengthen hauoratanga, whanaungatanga and Kahungunutanga. Kahungunu AGM Pä Sports Day November 2018, Splash Planet, Hastings In November we hosted another wonderful sports day with over 1,100 players from Wairoa to Wairarapa marae competing in netball, 3 on 3 basketball, volleyball, kiwi sports, Kï-o-rahi and euchre. Whänau came from Wellington, Masterton, Dannevirke, Hamilton and Wairoa. Our AGM meeting held outdoors was live streamed to 12,000 viewers. We provided “Kai Hau Kai” to our card carrying members. We also served a steak and garden salad lunch for 1,000 people and distributed 1,000 steam puddings with a can of peaches and bottle of cream plus hoodies and jackets left over from Te Matatini 2017. Iron Mäori December 2018, Ahuriri, Napier This year whänau came to support their loved ones as they ran around Ahuriri lagoon and cycled through the surrounding countryside. The swim section was abandoned due to high pollution levels in storm water created by the run-off from nearby industrial properties and farms. Kaumatua from near and far created a party vibe as they danced, pranced and sang their way across the finish line in their own event. It was heartening to see hundreds of youngsters participate in their special event. Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated is always delighted to sponsor this wonderful homegrown international lifestyle changing event. We acknowledge the sterling work of Missy & George Mackey as they bowed out of the IronMaori team. Stalwarts Heather & Wayne Skipworth alongside Lee Grace and his wife Kiri Bird will continue to put on a superb event. Waitangi Day February 2019, Hawke’s Bay Sports Park, Hastings Thousands turned out to enjoy our free National Day celebrations.The highlight for youngsters were the free Mahons Thrill rides all day. The Bostock and Crasborn family businesses provided free squash and pears and thousands of delighted and grateful locals took up the offer. It’s the first time it’s rained on Waitangi Day however that didn’t deter the turnout of sports teams competing in netball, 3 on 3 basketball, Kï-o-rahi, touch and league tournaments. Matariki Whänau Festival June 2018, Kahungunu wide Whänau from across our 6 taiwhenua regions came out in record numbers to our 18th annual Matariki Maori new year celebrations to enjoy feasting, festivity and fireworks. Tirama Matariki Light Trail kicked off festivities in Masterton on Queen’s Birthday weekend with a massive turnout for the 3 night event. The Mayor and deputy Mayor both turned up with their grandchildren to ride the Masterton miniature train in the dark. Tamatea celebrations at our new venue Back Paddock Lake near Takapau attracted another big crowd to the water lantern ceremony, kai, entertainment and spectacular fireworks. The same was experienced at our other Matariki celebrations in Heretaunga, Wairoa, Wainuiomata and Tämaki-nui-a-Rua with record crowds turning up at all these events. We appreciate our taiwhenua supporters, Wainuiomata Lions Rugby Leabue Club and funders Te Puni Kökiri, Trust House, Clubs Hastings, Lower Hutt Council and Ati Awa Toa FM.

The Company purchased the business formerly known as Hawke’s Bay Seafoods and the launch of Takitimu Seafoods fulfilled the long held Iwi aspiration of further investment in the fishing industry. It was a proud day for all the members of Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi. The Company share of the loss from the Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership is 1,138,915. While the Glomfjord performed strongly during the 2019 Hoki season, it is yet to prove itself as a year round capable vessel. The Company is working closely with the Pania Reef Fisheries partnership to strengthen the annual quota catch plan for the vessel with a view to improving the partnerships year round profitability. The loss incurred by the partnership was expected as the Iwi pushes forward on strengthening its position within the fishing industry. The purchase of the new fishing company is a welcome addition to our other key assets of fishing quota, the fishing vessel Glomfjord, shares in Aotearoa Fisheries Limited (AFL), Napier Mussels Limited, Fiordland Lobster Company Limited, and cash. The Company received the following settlement assets to manage on behalf of Ngäti Kahungunu in accordance with the Maori Fisheries Act 2004: • August 2006: 162,942,485 quota shares valued at $9,436,871 1 The shares in AFL and quota received under the Fisheries Settlement process have been included in the accounts at the value established by Te Ohu Kaimoana on transfer. Page 25 Kahungunu Asset Holding Company Ltd Chairman’s Report • August 2006: 7874 income shares in Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd, valued at $19,874,733 • July 2010: 501,527,278 quota shares valued at $16,933,500 • September 2012: Aquaculture pre-commencement space settlement cash $1,499,845 • Cash of $2,030,106. We have received a total of 15,748 shares (7,874 Voting, 7,874 Non- voting) in Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd (AFL) as part of the fisheries settlement which is a 6.3% holding in AFL. There will be no impairment of our shareholdings in AFL for this current year, although we may be required to undertake future re-valuations of our AFL shareholdings in the future. The Company is looking to strengthen its position with its current fisheries assets through a programme of consolidation and ongoing investment into Takitimu Seafoods. Non Fisheries Assets The Company will continue to investigate opportunities to diversify its asset portfolio. The Company takes a conservative approach to investment to deliberately reduce our exposure to undue risk. We are open to non-fisheries investment opportunities but it has to match our current investment strategy and risk profile. The Company provided funds for the Iwi to establish Kahutia Limited Partnership and funding for the purchase of land associated with the Kenderdine forest.

The Society is domiciled in New Zealand and is a charitable organisation registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and the Charities Act 2005. The financial statements comprising the Society and its controlled entities, Kahungunu Asset Holding Company Limited, Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership and Kahutia Limited Partnership, together the “Group”, are presented for the year ended 30 June 2019. These Group Financial statements and the accompanying notes summarise the financial results of activities carried out by the Society and have not been subject to audit. These figures are derived from the full financial statements. Basis of Preparation Statement of Compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in New Zealand (“NZ GAAP”). Ngäti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated is deemed to be a Public Benefit Entity – a PBEs primary objective is to provide goods and services for community or social benefit. Ngati Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated as a public benefit not-for-profit entity is eligible to apply Not-for-profit Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) on the basis that it does not have public accountability and it is not defined as large. The Board has elected to report in accordance with Tier 2 Not-for- profit PBE Accounting Standards and in doing so has taken advantage of all applicable Reduced Disclosure Regime (“RDR”) disclosure concessions. This decision results in the Group not preparing a Statement of Service Performance for both reporting periods. The Group Financial Statements comply with Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (“PBE IPSAS”) and other applicable financial reporting standards as appropriate that have been authorised for use by the External Reporting Board for Not-For- Profit and For-Profit entities. Kahungunu Asset Holdings Company Limited has been restated from NZIFRS RDR to PBE IPSAS RDR for Group Reporting. Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership has been restated from the Special Purpose Financial Reporting Framework for use by For-Profit Entities 2018 as issued by Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand to PBE IPSSAS RDR for Group Reporting. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in the full financial statements. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to balance date the Company sold 15 Ron Driver Place to a wholely owned subsidiary of Fiordland Lobster Company for $6,687,500. The proceeds were used to purchase properties at 43 and 45 Pandora Road and 54 Pandora Road, which Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership operates from. Page 33 Nga-ti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated Summary Financial Statements ABILITY FOR THE GROUPS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO OPERATE AS A GOING CONCERN During the period, the operations of the Group’s wholly-owned controlled entity of Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership, has reported a loss. Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership is reliant on sufficient working capital to lease ACE to supply its operation. Significant upfront costs are required to lease ACE in October 2019 and January 2020. As at 30 June 2019, Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership reported working capital was insufficient to fund the required ACE leases. Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership is reliant on ongoing working capital support from other entities within the Group, in the event that working capital finance cannot be obtained. Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership is also reliant on third parties to supply its operation once the ACE leases are obtained in order to meet the required volume and quality to operate profitably. During the period, the Group’s investment in Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership reported a loss and the Group recognised its 50% share of this loss in these financial statements. Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership’s liabilities exceeds its assets. Subsequent to balance date, Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership has generated a profit from the Hoki season during the months of July 2019 through to September 2019. Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership intends to continue operating for the foreseeable future, however this is reliant on future profitable voyages. Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership is reliant on the limited partners not demanding repayment of their advances to Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership, a profitable 2020 fishing season and extension of the ANZ Flexi Facility beyond the existing 31 October 2019 term. These two matters create a material uncertainty with regard to the continued operations of these investments. In the event that appropriate sources of funding were not able to be established, and the going concern of either of these entities was no longer valid, there would be adjustments necessary to the carrying value of assets and additional liabilities may result. The Trustees believe the going concern assumption for the Group is valid and have reached this conclusion having regard to the circumstances which they consider likely to affect Takitimu Seafoods Limited Partnership, Pania Reef Fisheries Limited Partnership and the Group during the period of one year from the date these financial statements are approved. These summary Financial Statements cannot be expected to provide as complete an understanding as provided by the full financial statements. An unmodified opinion was issued on the full group financial statements. Each tribal member is entitled to obtain a copy of the full financial statements upon request.
