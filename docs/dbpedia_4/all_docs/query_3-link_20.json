        "text": "Wairarapa Moana Trust\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of the Wairarapa Moana Trust was held at Rathkeale College, Masterton on 7 November. Attendees heard about the Trust’s activities over the 2008-09 year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrust Chair, Sonya Rimene, was pleased to announce a surplus of $12,496 for the year, achieved during a time of global recession. “The challenge for us will be to invest in things that will get the most return and value for our wha¯nau,” Sonya reported.\n\nThe Trust reported on its achievements over the past year which included: • Twenty-three\n\nScholarships; approved Future Leaders\n\n• Five Future Leaders Trade Training\n\nApprenticeship Scholarships; • $30,000 to Pouakani Marae to assist with the completion of the wharekai, Hinehuirangi; • Progress continues to staging the Wairarapa\n\nMoana Exhibition – History Of The Lake, to promote the history of Wairarapa Moana, proposed for 2010;\n\n• Continued Shears. sponsorship of the Golden\n\nDuring April 2009, the Trust held its second successful Future Leaders Wa¯nanga at Te Ore Ore Marae where successful scholarship recipients and their wha¯nau came together to learn what it means to come from Wairarapa Moana.\n\nPouakani Marae trustees, James Pedersen and Whitu Karauna, provided comprehensive updates regarding progress on the re-building of Pouakani Marae.\n\nTrustees fielded questions about Trust activities, specifically in regard to the Trust’s Constitution and holiday employment on Wairarapa Moana Farms.\n\nThis year Anne Carter and Sonya Rimene stepped down from the Trust. Replacement trustees were confirmed as Diane Rewi and Henare Manaena who will now accompany Pani Himona, Tame Matiaha, Lynnette Te Maari-Whata and co-opted member Arawhetu Peretini for the coming year.\n\nAn Historical Review of Te Ore Ore\n\nThe following information was shared during the visit to Te Ore Ore Marae as part of the bus tour on the sights of significance trip during the morning of the AGMs. This information has been provided courtesy of Pani Himona.\n\nKo Rangitumau me Tararua nga Maunga, Ko Ruamahanga te Awa, ko Wairarapa te Moana, ko Te Ore Ore te Marae, Ko Ngati Hamua te Hapu¯, ko Ngati Kahungunu, Rangitane raua ko Ngai Tahu nga Iwi, ko Paora Potangaroa te Poropiti; Tihei Mauriora\n\nTe Ore Ore Marae\n\nTe Ore Ore Marae is situated about five kilometers east of Masterton on the Bideford Road. The area got its name from a distinguished warrior from the Whatuiapiti hapu¯ who was visiting the area and soon discovered the local beauty, Hinemataki. He decided to call upon Hinemataki and later during the night, people heard the hearty laughter coming from the whare. One would assume the Whatuiapiti warrior could tell some pretty good jokes. Hence the full name of the Marae is Te Ore Ore a te kata a Hinemataki.\n\nThe area was previously known as Kaitekateka and was inhabited by the Ngati Hamua people. Te Hamua is a direct descendent of Rangitane, the grandson of Whatonga who captained the Kurahaupo waka to Aotearoa. It is this hapu¯ that occupied the northern part of the Wairarapa valley. When Ngati Kahungunu iwi arrived in Wairarapa, some landed at Rangiwhakaoma (Castle Point) and they engaged in battle with the local inhabitants, Ngati Hamua. Eventually peace was made and inter-marriage took place between the two iwi. From this union evolved a larger and stronger Ngati Hamua hapu¯ with individual members retaining their individual iwi connections. It is now recognised that both Rangitane and Ngati Kahungunu iwi are the tangata whenua and because of the inter-marriage between the two iwi; we have become one people, Ngati Hamua.\n\nNga Tau E Waru\n\nIn the late 1870s a huge, by today’s standards, wharenui was being planned at Kaitekateka measuring 100 by 30 feet. The land was gifted by a Ngati Hamua chieftain Wi Waaka. Two of the prominent builders, Paora Potangaroa and Te Kere had differences of opinions with the construction, so the latter left the project but as he departed, Te Kere uttered “E kore e taea te whakamutu i mua atu i nga tau e waru.” (It will take all of eight years to complete this building.)\n\nHowever, the building was completed in one year and Paora Potangaroa named the Wharenui “Nga Tau E Waru” in reminder of the prophecy of Te Kere. The Tohunga Whakairo were Hemi Taepa of Te Arawa and Tamati Aorere of Ngati Kahungunu.\n\nNga Tau E Waru was opened in the early 1880s. Many people attended the opening to witness this majestic wharenui, which was beautifully carved, and the front area was completely decorated in tukutuku and kowhaiwhai.\n\nTe Haki a Potangaroa\n\nIn 1881, Paora Potangaroa called his people together to interpret a vision he had had. People came from all over Aotearoa to hear what this renown prophet had to say. The crowds arrived over a period of two or three weeks prior to the planned announcement. Large stocks of provisions were on hand to feed the visitors; the catering was an enormous task, feeding up to 3000 people. On the 15 March1881 the proceedings commenced. After karakia, Potangaroa raised a flag that he had commissioned to be made and asked the people present what they thought the symbols on the flag meant. No one could interpret the flag.\n\nMuch later, Paora announced the meaning of his flag, “Retain your land; too much of your land has already been sold and only sprinklings of reserves remain. Don’t get into debt, don’t pay any debts you have”.\n\nGenerally people went home disappointed as they had expected some sort of miracle.\n\nThe Monument\n\nAfter the opening of Nga Tau e Waru, the local people installed a monument inside of the wharenui to commemorate the advent of Christianity. The inscription reads as follows: HE TOHU WHAKAMAHARATANGA TENEI MO TE TIMATANGA MAI OTE WHAKAPONO OTENEI IWI O NGATIKAHUNGUNU. I TIMATA MAI ITE TAU 1839 TAE NOA KI TE TAU 1881. KA POUA TENEI POU, HEI TOHU WHAKAMAHARATANGA KI O MATOU WHAKATIPURANGA E HAERE AKE NEI. KIA WHAKAPAINGIAKOE E IHOWA I RUNGA RAWA. AMINE MAEHE 16TH 1881\n\nDuring the next forty years many people died during the flu epidemic. This caused unrest at Te Ore Ore and many wondered whether the monument erected inside the wharenui might have been the cause. The locals petitioned Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana to remove the monument from inside the wharenui. With the consent of the Potangaroa wha¯nau, the monument was transferred on the 16 April 1928. The contents that were placed within the monument were taken to Ratana Pa. A plaque was erected at the base of the monument to record the event.\n\nAPERIRA 16 1928 – KO TE RA TENEI I – NEKEHIA MAI AI E – RATANA TE KOHATU –WHAKAMAHARATANGA – I POUA NEI E PAORA – POTANGAROA KI ROTO –I NGA TAU E WARU – NA NGA WHANAUNGA – KATOA O TE – POTANGAROA TENEI –WHAKAAETANGA ME – TE MOREHU I EKE – MAI KI TENEI – MARAE\n\nThe Destruction of Nga Tau E Waru by Fire.\n\nIn September 1939, Ngati Hamua suffered a terrible fate. The Haeata wha¯nau living at Hiona noticed a fire burning across the Ruamahanga River. Young Te Nahu Haeata sounded the alarm. The men reached the Marae to find their wharenui was burning out of control. The local people arrived in droves; they were devastated as they grieved and watched helplessly as Nga Tau E Waru burned to the ground. Within a year, the locals were committed to replacing the destroyed building. The wider community began raising funds through various means. The Hamua Glee Concert Party played a prominent part in raising funds as they rallied together the Wairarapa hapu¯ to compete in kapahaka and sporting competitions. Subsidised funding was sought from the Government and was granted conditional upon the new building being named “The Te Ore Ore Centennial Memorial Meeting House”.\n\nPani Himona presenting the history of the Marae ›› CONTINUED ... An appropriate plaque was made and attached to the front wall of the building. Soon the erecting of the new building commenced. Te Nahu Haeata (Snr) and Joe Hutana and others re-depicted the carvings from photographs taken of the old building.\n\nWith much pride, the community gathered to witness the opening of the new meetinghouse on 16 March 1941.\n\nIn 1962, the addition of the dining room, ablutions and kitchen commenced under the leadership of Fred Thompson and a group of local volunteers who toiled weekend after weekend for many years to provide the added facilities to the Marae. The building was funded mainly by regular Friday night Housie run by Atu and Sally Mikaera, again every Friday night for many years. The building extensions were completed in April 1966.\n\nIn 1977, the Te Ore Ore Ma¯ori Committee started planning and fundraising for the extension to the kitchen. A major fundraiser was the erection of a whare takaro (play house) as a raffle prize. It was built by Atu Mikaera; it measured 8 feet long, 6 feet wide and 8 feet high at the apex of the roof. The house was built on the style of Nga Tau E Waru, adorned with tukutuku and the front carved with similar designs by two students from Hato Paora College. The playhouse has since been dismantled and the carvings returned to Te Ore Ore and erected as a waharoa (entrance way) to the Ahitainga Urupa.\n\nOn the 5 March 1979 the two students from Hato Paora College carved a seat and their wha¯nau presented it to Te Ore Ore Marae on the occasion of their grandparents (Dick and Riria Himona’s) Golden Wedding anniversary.\n\n1981\n\nOn 22 March, Te Ore Ore observed the centennial celebrations of Nga Tau E Waru. Several hundred people came to the function and participated in a number of activities involving culture, religion and sport, as well as a good hakari.\n\nSubsidised Work Schemes\n\nIn 1989, the committee built a garage workshop on the Marae under a PEP scheme. The project was led by the late Harry Haeata. This building later served as the carving shed for subsequent projects. In 1992, the Marae embarked on replacing the ablutions block on the southern side of the dining room. Plans were approved and a team of PEP workers was engaged under the project management of the late Pani Himona (Jnr).\n\nCarving Restoration\n\nThe year 1999 marked the commencement of replacing the carvings for Nga Tau E Waru. A totara tree from Pouakani forest was felled and transported to Masterton. It was milled into the required dimensions and became ready for use. The tohunga whakairo was Tipene Kawana, a mokopuna of Kingi and Araiterangi Kawana, who lived 200 metres north of the Marae. He tutored six students over a period of four years and in 2004 the old carvings were taken down and the new installed with much ceremony and karakia before a large number of wha¯nau. The carvers and assistants toiled throughout the night to complete the transition of the carvings that took place before dawn. The Haeata wha¯nau were granted custody of the old carvings and these were taken off site to be restored. The early morning scene at the Marae was indescribable; there was a mixture of tears of sorrow and joy by those present to witness the transition in a very slight falling of mist from above. Truly present were our tupuna of bygone days. The day ended with karakia, waiata and whanaungatanga.\n\nNga Tupuna o Nga Tau E Waru\n\nTekoteko:\n\nKoruru: Centre: Pouaro: Left Amo: Right Amo: Above doorway: Above windows:\n\nMitre 10 DIY\n\nIn April 2005 Te Ore Ore wha¯nau and friends of Te Ore Ore assembled at the Marae for over a week and joined in the mammoth task of upgrading the Marae. Even with two days of rain, the many volunteers completed all the tasks allotted and completed the week by celebrating the return of our TV stars, nga kuia, waiata, whanaungatanga and a hakari.\n\n2005 2006\n\nWairarapa Archive has launched its new web-based digital photograph database, called “Picture Wairarapa”. The new system is based on the archives current database but researchers will be able to check through the digital images as a separate search, saving a lot of time. At present, there are nearly 2000 images on the system but numbers are expected to quickly increase. The next stage of the archive’s digital project is to add these images to ‘Matapihi’, the nationwide federated database of cultural heritage images.\n\nJacob Campion, a young Lower Hutt schoolboy, was on a family holiday at Castlepoint during October when he unearthed a Ma¯ori adze head. Police were called when bones were also unearthed and an almost complete skeleton was pieced together over a couple of hours before the remains were taken to Wairarapa Hospital morgue for forensic examination.\n\nCommercial paua divers in Wairarapa are taking the fight to poachers now plundering the coastline to feed a multi-million dollar black market. Legitimate operators are to brand their vehicles and boats with orange identification signs and use global positioning system data loggers while driving throughout the Paua 2 allocations area, which stretches from Turaekirae Head in Wellington to Blackhead Point in Central Hawke’s Bay, Paua 2 Industry Association chairman, Tony Craig, said. Mr Craig, who also works as\n\nWairarapa in brief\n\nAotearoa Fisheries quota manager, said the Masterton launch recently of the branding and data logging is the first step by the association to protect the sustainability of an annual take of 121 tonnes of paua valued at more than $4 million.\n\nWairarapa Moana descendant, SHAKIRA BAKER, was a member of the successful Wairarapa-Bush team that recently competed at the Hurricanes secondary schoolgirls regional rugby tournament held at Yarrow Stadium in New Plymouth. In their three winning performances, Wairarapa-Bush completely dominated the second division racking up a remarkable 162 points while keeping their opposition scoreless. Shakira, the leading try-scorer for Wairarapa-Bush was later named in the tournament team, however, that side will not play their usual end-of-season fixture with their Auckland tournament counterparts due to a lack of funds and the same reason could also mean the age-group tourneys in general are not played in 2010.\n\nWairarapa Moana Wetlands Restoration. After years of neglect and fragmented management, Wairarapa Moana now has a knight in shining armour, in fact, a number of them. Greater Wellington Regional Council and Department of Conservation have teamed up with South Wairarapa District Council and Wairarapa iwi to plan a long-term rescue mission to improve the ecological health of the lake and its environs. The group is now working towards restoring some of the lake’s wetlands and a more unified management regime. We look forward to receiving further updates with regard to the group’s progress.\n\nShareholder Bank Account Details\n\nPayment of dividends to shareholders resident in New Zealand is made by way of Direct Credit to shareholders bank accounts.
