The series examines how our understandings of the global might alter if we began with processes, connections, entanglements and peoples other than the standard accounts of globalization as endogenous to the West and diffused out from it. Robbie Shilliam, in his book, The Black Pacific: Anti-Colonial Struggles and Oceanic Connections, provides us with an exemplary account of both concerns. In this remarkable book, he forcefully demonstrates both the possibility and the very necessity of a different kind of theory for a global age. The Black Pacific, Shilliam argues, is both a provocation and a problem. It addresses the populations and narratives of Oceania and locates them in their, usually forgotten, relations to other parts and peoples of the world. In doing so, Shilliam recovers the deep relations between (but not only) formerly colonized subjects in order to redeem the possibilities generated by and generative of anti-colonial solidarities. He does this in the terms and concepts of ‘colonial science’ as well as in the terms and concepts of ‘decolonial science’, which is, as he suggests, another kind of science. In navigating with skill and expertise between and through colonial and decolonial science, Shilliam offers us possibilities of seeing the world again and anew. This is not an easy book to read for those of us schooled only in the language of colonial science. Even those of us committed to other ways of knowing the world and other visions of the world might be challenged by the journeys Shilliam prompts us to take alongside him. That challenge is itself part of the journey and the reward of this provocative, powerful theorization of the politics of the world we inhabit and the effort needed to cultivate the worlds we wish. From the prosaic and mundane, the political and social, Shilliam takes us also\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 6\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nSeries Foreword\n\nvii\n\nto the spiritual and poetic and the redemptive powers and prophecies that animate decolonial science in service of our deep relations. The Black Pacific not only presents a history, politics and sociology of selfdetermination in other places, but contributes to the very determining of self that is constitutive of all projects of liberation.

Upon arrival in Auckland, the organizers of the tour drove the troupe almost immediately to the very tip of the North Island. There, at a small hamlet called Te Hāpua, Keskidee and Ras Messengers gathered outside a marae (traditional meeting place) of Ngāti Kuri, the local tangata whenua (people of the land). A karanga (call) was given, acknowledging the dead and welcoming the manuhiri (guests) onto the land. A kaumātua (elder) of Ngāti Kuri then proceeded to introduce his guests to the significance of the place where they now stood. He asked them to consider that, although they had the Queen of England living among them in London, Ngāti Kuri lived at ‘the spiritual departure place throughout the world’. The kaumātua concluded with the traditional greeting of tātou tātou – ‘everyone being one people’. Then Rufus Collins, director of Keskidee, responded on behalf of the visitors: You talked of your ancestors, how they had taken part in our meeting, and I do agree with you because if it was not for them you would not be here. You talked of our ancestors, taking part and making a meeting some place and somewhere; the ancestors are meeting because we have met. I do agree with you.\n\nBut Collins also recalled the association made by the kaumātua between themselves and the Queen and politely refuted the association: ‘we are here despite the Queen’.1\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 1\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n2\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nThere are three aspects of this meeting that are noteworthy. First is the modality of the greeting. The Māori kaumātua does not treat these visitors as aliens or ‘others’ but as peoples who already share a relation that must be creatively retrieved because it is not just individuals who are meeting but their ancestors too. Second is the response to the greeting. Collins accepts the modality of relating provided by the tangata whenua (people of the land) and confirms, indeed, that the ancestors are meeting and that the Māori are no more ‘others’ to them as they are to Māori. Nevertheless, third, Collins also finds within this indigenous modality the resources with which to critically cultivate the relationship. Māori have often appealed to their partner, the Crown, to compel British settlers to honour in good faith Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi) that many of the rangatira (chiefs) had signed in 1840. The kaumātua therefore recognized the auspicious provenance of the visitors – in terms of their proximity to the Queen – yet also sought to inform them of the different but equally significant provenance of the land on which they now stood. For Cape Rēinga was close by, which in many Māori cosmologies is the departing point for spirits to journey back to the homeland of Hawaiki. Nevertheless, the Queen had been no partner to the Black actors and musicians visiting from London; she was, rather, a symbol of (post)colonial oppression that had to be replaced. Following Collins’ comments, the Ras Messengers began the chant that rerouted the provenance of the troupe from the halls of Buckingham Palace to the highlands of Ethiopia: ‘Rastaman come from Mount Zion …’2 Despite the separations of oceans (Pacific, Atlantic), of geo-political position (peripheral Aotearoa NZ, metropolitan Britain), of race (brown, black), and of sociological hue (the indigenous, the descendants of enslaved), a deep relationship binds these groups, one that seems to belie a separated reality. This incommensurability between rich relationality and poor material connectivity provokes a set of questions. What cosmologies underpin this greeting at Te Hāpua? What techniques of relating enable it? What stories buttress it? What projects of self-determination accompany it, and how do\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 2\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nthey inform a sensibility of global injustice over colonial rule? My book seeks to provide insights that might help answer these questions so that the greeting at Te Hāpua does not appear as a peculiar and arcane episode but rather becomes intelligible as part of a deep, global infrastructure of anti-colonial connectivity. I also hope that the book will help to cultivate the spiritual, ethical, intellectual and political sensibilities required to critically support, renew and extend this infrastructure. To my mind, this is the most urgent and challenging task of cultivating theory for a global age. But in order to start the journey a prior question must first be addressed: why are engagements with meetings such as that which took place at Te Hāpua so rarely engaged with in academic inquiry? To answer, it will be instructive for us to consider a modality of relating that is quite different to that utilized at Te Hāpua. In July 1886 the Graphic magazine published a map of the world that accompanied an article by John Charles Ready Colomb on the status of British imperialism.3 The map, commissioned by the Imperial Federation League, has since become one of the most iconic cartographic representations of empire.4 Ready’s article reflected the anxieties felt by British commentators at the time over the need to maintain the integrity of their empire in the face of increased imperial competition.5 For this purpose the map brings together the peoples who populate colonial territories – both settlers and non-settlers – and depicts them in cartoon relief around the peripheral areas of the map. They are all captured by the gaze of Britannica, the figure that is centrefold on the Greenwich meridian. In this depiction the peripheral figures, especially the colonized among them, can only understand themselves in mute relation to the imperial centre.6 And there is certainly no possibility of the colonized relating to each other across the global spaces, as in the greeting at Te Hāpua, and cultivating knowledge ‘sideways’ so as to possibly inform a decolonial project. The pretensions of this cartographic gaze have been thoroughly protested in the Western academy by many intellectuals in their critical investigations of the key tropes of Western social theory: ‘self/other’,\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 3\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\n4\n\n‘master/slave(servant)’. Indeed, the turn towards theorizing representation, discourse and culture across the social sciences has been dependent upon and in a sense has breathed new life into these tropes. Before this turn, however, Jean-Paul Sartre had dared to do something different. As a French intellectual, Sartre engaged with the problem of colonialism by displacing himself from the centre of the world so as to witness a relationship between other selves. In his preface to Frantz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth, written in 1961, Sartre bid his fellow Europeans to enter the book with these words: After a few steps in the night, you will see strangers gathered round a fire, draw closer, listen: they are discussing the fate they have in store for your trading posts, for the mercenaries who defend them. They will see you perhaps, but they will continue to talk among themselves without even lowering their voices. Their indifference strikes at our hearts …7\n\nSartre’s attempt to displace the cartographic gaze rather than to dwell solely upon its operation was part of a political commitment to anti-colonial struggle for which Fanon, of course, had made the quintessential statement. But even though promoted by a white metropolitan intellectual, Sartre’s standpoint quickly disappeared from subsequent conversations of social theorists in the Western academy. The cartographic master tropes of the Graphic were quickly re-inhabited and, through them, these theorists returned to primarily intra-European controversies.8 Sartre’s provocation did, however, find a resonance in a group of largely Indian intellectuals who, in the early 1980s, sought to break the cartographic gaze of the Graphic’s imperial world map by proposing that those colonized peripheral figures – the subalterns – had lucid minds behind their fixed stare. Truth be told, the intellectuals of Subaltern Studies were influenced not by Sartre but mostly by E. P. Thompson’s approach to ‘history from below’ and its Gramscian sensitivities to culture and meaning as key sites of social struggle. Above all, though, Subaltern Studies was an intellectual response to the\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 4\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\npopular-democratic movements that gained prominence for a period of time after the ousting of Indira Gandhi and her rule by state of emergency.9 Subaltern Studies sought to create a cognate space of democratization within the historiography of India, a practice of storytelling that had heretofore been dominated by the ‘Cambridge School’ and Marxism, both of which had produced elitist accounts wherein the peasantry were rendered an unreasoning or pre-political mass.10 Ranajit Guha’s ground-breaking work on peasant rebellions argued that colonial elites might have dominated the hinterlands of India, but had not achieved hegemony over them.11 Instead, the peasantry had engaged with colonial rule through their own forms of political consciousness, the seedbed of which lay in spiritual lore. In this sense, the consciousness of the peasantry could not be categorized as pre-political but rather as political in ways other-wise to the idealized version of secular European reason pronounced by colonial (and indeed native) elites.12 Guha implored historians to listen to these ‘small voices’ of the past and, in their presence, to consider ‘what kind of history would be written?’13 This historiographical intervention had contemporary political import. For if the peasantry had now become citizens then the register of political rationality also required democratization. In this movement the elitist profane logic of state and social interest would have to be disturbed and displaced by the ‘small voices’.14 The Subaltern Studies project soon ran into a series of problems laid out most famously by Gayatri Spivak via an engagement with the figure of the subaltern woman.15 Spivak’s work posed a set of questions. Was it possible to recover the political consciousness of the subalterns as knowledge untainted by the exercise of power? To what extent was the notion of a ‘resisting subject’ itself a category born of European fantasies of their own mastery? And, in this respect, was the very attempt to represent the subaltern not also an act of epistemic domination akin to those undertaken by other elitist historians? In sum, did sympathetic ventriloquism induce the same affect as elitist silencing? Addressing these questions, Spivak carefully argued that Subaltern Studies was a politically necessary but necessarily irresolvable intellectual project.16\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 5\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n6\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nYet she went further than this. Because the subaltern could not appear ‘without the thought of the elite’, Spivak also proclaimed that the subaltern provided ‘the model for a general theory of consciousness’. Specifically, she argued that ‘the historical predicament of the colonial subaltern’ could be considered the ‘allegory of the predicament of all thought, all deliberative consciousness’.17 Philosophically, then, Spivak bade the subaltern to travel from the periphery to the centre, but only to become there the ‘recalcitrant difference’ that structured elite discourse.18 As the project was taken up in Western intellectual spaces, enabled by what I would call an opportunistic utilization of Spivak’s sympathetic critique, Subaltern Studies was made to proffer less an opportunity to decolonize knowledge regimes and more another faculty through which to deconstruct knowledge of the Western self. As such, Subaltern Studies could interface with – even be collapsed into – the post-structuralist project (broadly conceived), a project that was also decidedly post-Sartre in its singular obsession with the modern (read colonizing European) subject.19 With these movements the peripheral figures on the Graphic’s imperial world map, now encoded as subalterns, were once more emptied of epistemic authority so as to become the cipher through which to interpret the proclivities of Britannica – the self and master. Perhaps these incorporations were reflective of the general trajectories of the Western academy after the defeat of the Third World project and the apparent re-incorporation of troublesome populations back into neo-imperial orbits through neo-liberal governance. No doubt, the end of the Second World project (i.e. global communism) did nothing to arrest this movement; nor did the subsequent internationalization of the staff and student constituencies of Western universities through the globalization of elites rather than through the global democratization of life chances and the attendant decolonization of knowledge. Nevertheless, the originating democratic impulse has remained seminal to Subaltern Studies. Dipesh Chakrabarty still hopes for a ‘subaltern historiography that actually tries to learn from the subaltern’,20 although in his own work he marks the subaltern as\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 6\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nonly an epistemic limit to historical knowledge.21 Spivak, meanwhile, has always read Subaltern Studies as a political intervention, that is, as ‘a strategic use of positivist essentialism in a scrupulously visible interest’.22 More recently, however, Spivak has focused on pedagogy, a move honed through her practitioner work with marginalized communities. She has given up her ‘apologetic formula’ for Subaltern Studies as the strategic use of essentialism, and has found instead, ‘a different one emerging from my own subaltern study: learning to learn from below’. ‘This one’, Spivak suggests (and here I would recall the fate of Sartre’s intervention in the Western academy), ‘will have had few takers.’23 I want to dwell on these (somewhat slim) openings in Subaltern Studies because to my mind the transmogrification of Subaltern Studies from an engaged democratic project into postcolonial critique has (unintentionally) serviced the colonial ‘fatal impact’ thesis.24 This thesis rests on the assumption that indigenous cultures could not withstand or compete with the sophistication of European civilization: they would have to die or transform into substitute versions of the conquering culture. At the epistemic level I would argue that the category of the subaltern is part of this erasure. In his own way, even Gramsci, the immediate source of the category of the subaltern, is complicit in this erasure. He states that some social strata – especially the peasantry – seem to be incapable of developing their own intellectuals because in the very moment of their formation as intellectuals they cease to be ‘organic’ to that stratum.25 But what if, in the pursuit of ‘epistemic justice’,26 the democratic impulse of Subaltern Studies were to be separated from the very term ‘subaltern’? The seedbed of such a decolonial project would not, then, be found in academic discourse but in the living knowledge traditions of colonized peoples.27 Maligned, ridiculed, attacked and disavowed by colonial forces, these traditions have nevertheless retained a tenacious thread of vitality that provides for the possibility of a retrieval of thought and action that addresses global injustices in ways otherwise to the colonial science of the gaze. Crucially, these projects have refused – and more often than not ignored – the injunctions of the\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 7\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n8\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nfatal impact thesis. Their ethos of living other-wise is expressed by Bob Marley in the following verse: ‘we refuse to be what you wanted us to be, we are what we are, that’s the way it’s going to be’.28 In light of these decolonial projects, the category of the subaltern becomes singularly unhelpful, if not meaningless. For the colonized figures on the periphery of the Graphic’s world map have always named and re-named themselves as, for example, ‘sufferers’,29 Black Israelites, Ethiopians, RasTafari, Tūhoe, Ngāti Kuri, Māori, Ham and Shem. And, heretically, these peoples have often determined the meaning of Britannica on her behalf as they cultivate useful understandings of their relationships to power. This is precisely what Reitu Harris, president of the predominantly Māori Black Power gang, does when he states that ‘to me the word “Pākehā” no longer stands for “European” … it stands for a type of person who … when it rains, will rush for shelter themselves and not care about others getting wet’.30 In this respect it is not possible to speak of a ‘decolonial project’ in the abstract, that is, as an academic enterprise separated from living knowledge traditions. For instance, Kaupapa Māori is a knowledge framework that, while utilized academically in Māori Studies, has a constituency, purview and knowledge base that encompasses the wider Māori world (Te Ao Māori). Kaupapa Māori is a critical project of self-determination at the level of knowledge cultivation, and frames intellectual priorities and working practices through mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge systems).31 Kaupapa Māori and other grounded decolonial projects of epistemic justice undermine the fatal impact thesis in so far as they refuse the colonial conceit that European knowledge traditions hold supreme interpretative authority over the varied cosmologies and cultures of humanity. The disciples of anthropology and sociology have long claimed that Western academia institutionally embodies modern self-reflexivity, that is, a superior ability to critically examine oneself as well as – and in relation to – others. Social scientific interpretations of reality, because critical, are assumed to be more mobile and hence more universalizable than particular context-specific ‘lay’ interpretations. Poststructural/\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 8\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\npostcolonial justifications for fixating upon the gaze of Britannica implicitly reproduce the assumption that a qualitative difference exists between interpreters: the lay/subaltern/colonized practitioner is unknowable to herself but, thank God, at least the academic/expert/ modern subject is knowable to himself at the limit of his experience.32 However, if we mark the fatal impact thesis as a fantasy, then we must at least consider that self-reflexivity (personal and institutional) is in no way a unique product of modernity but is rather, in the basic sense of the word, traditional. And if self-reflexivity is institutionally traditional, then even the interpretative superiority of Western academia must be radically questioned. In this decolonial apprehension, there can exist in principle only a quantitative difference between the representations made by academics and those made by practitioners – a difference predicated upon the infrastructural power to disseminate knowledge of others. So by this reasoning I remind myself that entering academia is not a fatal impact, a transmogrification of my being into a modern reflexive self, but rather, a problematic mapping of the legacies of collective struggles and their living knowledge traditions onto an institution of privilege. It is my decision as to whether I wish to cash in that privilege wisely by contributing to a decolonization of knowledge regimes with a liberatory intent, instead of passively deferring to the valorization of Britannica. I choose, then, to return us to Te Hāpua and a greeting, not between subaltern A and subaltern B, but between Keskidee, Ras Messengers and Ngāti Kuri (the people of that land). I cannot speak for Sartre or his people, but I notice that he follows me back to the campfires. There I ask to fold myself into this greeting at Te Hāpua, on the terms given by the greeters, terms that in at least some way I am already invested in. Through these terms I critically contribute to the support, renewal and extension of a global infrastructure of anticolonial connectivity. Hence the title of this book, The Black Pacific, which is both a provocation and a problem. The term ‘Black Pacific’ has, in the main, been used to refer to the variable and shifting nature of African-American and North-Pacific\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 9\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n10\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nAsian ties of kinship, politics and ideology against the backdrop of US imperial ambitions in the region.33 ‘Black Pacific’, of course, is a comparative remix of ‘Black Atlantic’,34 a term popularized by Paul Gilroy in his endeavour to recast Western modernity by reference to the double consciousness of Diaspora Africans living in North American society.35 And yet in some ways Gilroy’s seminal work reproduces the cartographic imagination of the Graphic’s imperial world map: continental Africa is hardly treated as agental within modernity; it sits mostly silent besides the vocal Americas where its progeny have taken on life as ‘moderns’.36 Likewise, the dominant cartographic imaginary of the Black Pacific tends to focus on its Rim and less so on the ‘sea of islands’ composed of a dazzling array of related peoples, languages, cultures and polities.37 Here the question arises as to whether the indigenous peoples of this vast Oceanic region are to be muted in the analysis of global interconnections. (I will now follow Epeli Hau`ofa in preferring the term Oceania rather than Pacific.38) With these challenges in mind, Teresia Teaiwa’s warnings on analogical reasoning are extremely valuable.39 Teaiwa notes that while, in the early twentieth century, Oceania was a region of intense interest for ethnographic and anthropological inquiry it subsequently lost much of its value for Western academia. More recently, scholars of the region have tried to reinject value through analogy, i.e. the ‘Caribbeanization’ or ‘Africanization’ of the Pacific. The title of this book was enthusiastically suggested to me by my publishing company no doubt for such purposes of valorization. Nevertheless, I agreed to this title because it has a purchase beyond the market and besides analogy. The peoples and projects that we will walk with in this book have in various ways identified Black and its inferences to Africa – both continental and diasporic – as a key site of struggle for indigenous self-determination in Aotearoa NZ and, to some extent, Oceania at large. Less an analogy, these engagements reference Black (and African) as part of a global infrastructure of anti-colonial connectivity. I follow these sensibilities and join this book with cognate intellectual enterprises.40\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 10\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nThe fundamental aim of this book is to redeem the possibilities of anti-colonial solidarity between colonized and (post)colonized peoples on terms other than those laid out by colonial science. This will entail a wilful movement across various academic fields of study guided not by abstract concerns for interdisciplinarity but by the analytical imperatives of this redemption. And for the same reason, this aim will necessitate a plural register of argumentation spanning the social scientific, narrational, poetic and personal. The most important purpose of this book is to retrieve the relationship between African and Māori anti-colonial struggles as a space that supports spiritual, intellectual and political commitments to mana motuhake, a central term for the following investigations, which in Te Reo (the Māori language) can be glossed as ‘self-determination’. Such retrieval is especially important for a society – Aotearoa NZ – which tries to bury its living colonial frontier under a worldly ‘multiculturalism’, thereby stifling the spirit of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty), signed in 1840 between many rangatira (chiefs) and Queen Victoria, and additionally, whitewashing imperial legacies in Oceania. A second purpose is to strengthen the confidence of peoples of African heritage as to the global (and never marginal) importance of our anticolonial struggles and ongoing decolonial projects. A third purpose is to underline the fact that European colonization has depended upon an interlocking super-exploitation of labour and super-dispossession of land organized along lines of race.41 Hence, the exorcism of racial inequality requires the cultivation of spiritual, philosophical and political standpoints that reach across these lines to rebind the various descendant communities who have and continue to suffer from such exploitation and dispossession. A fourth purpose is to build a political commitment among intellectuals to what I would call ‘deep relation’, that is, a commitment to leave behind current academic endorsements of privileged narcissism. In the next chapter I shall elucidate a decolonial science adequate to the task of cultivating knowledge of deep relation between peoples who, like Keskidee, Ras Messengers and Ngāti Kuri, appear on the\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 11\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n12\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nimperial world map to be irrevocably distant and disconnected subalterns. A science of deep relation allows us to reason and walk some way with Black Power and young Māori warriors, with Panthers of the Polynesian type, with Black liberation theologians as they encounter indigenous struggles and spirituality, with Black thespians and RasTafari musicians as they attempt to catalyse the soul powers of Oceania, with the RasTafari of the House of Shem, with prophetic movements that chant down Babylon but that are indigenous to Oceania, and with all the peoples and projects who seek to heal the wounds suffered at the hands of Cook and Columbus.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 12\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n1\n\nDeep Relation\n\nIntroduction In this chapter I build a decolonial science of ‘deep relation’. The depth that I am retrieving can be found in a relationality that exists underneath the wounds of coloniality,1 a cutting logic that seeks to – but on the whole never quite manages to – segregate peoples from their lands, their pasts, their ancestors and spirits. Decolonial science seeks to repair colonial wounds, binding back together peoples, lands, pasts, ancestors and spirits. Its greatest challenge is to bind back together the manifest and spiritual domains. For in the latter domain there exist hinterlands that were never colonized by Cook and Columbus, and therein lie the supports of a global infrastructure of anti-colonial connectivity. Decolonial science affirms Rufus Collins’ reply to the kaumātua (elder) at Te Hāpua that ‘the ancestors are meeting because we have met’. This science will become our compass and energy store. The knowledge traditions of Māori and Pasifika peoples utilize sophisticated practices of relating – and valuing relations – that are firmly embedded in particular locales and peoples yet at the same time proffer general principles of engagement without laying claim to abstracted universals.2 These practices, in part, depend on a participatory criterion which renders the categorical segregation of the ‘researcher’ from the ‘researched’ impossible.3 For this reason the chapter is organized along partially autobiographical lines. The living and growing knowledge traditions of Oceania – especially\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 13\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n14\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nmātauranga Māori – were an edifying gift that enabled me to dispense with the colonizing methodology of social science that I had previously been trying to work through/against. I learnt aspects of these traditions sometimes through university engagements but much more commonly through the intellectuals outside of academia who I worked with and for whom philosophy, ethics and application are not distinct pursuits.4 This work impelled me to recover, work in and work with the living knowledge traditions that were most urgent for the collective repair of the colonial wounds that had directly affected me. And ever since, I have been embedding myself back in the ‘continent of Black consciousness’5 that I claim personal historical allegiance to via the Indian Ocean human trafficking of Africans. The flow of the chapter reflects this journey. As a clearing exercise I decolonize Hermes, the European agent that interprets relations. I then bring forth respective agents of Oceania – Tāne/Māui – and Africa – Legba – who cultivate knowledge through deep relation. As they meet, Tāne/Māui and Legba find existing commonalities between their relating skills, skills that are encompassed by the term ‘grounding’, and that enable them to know themselves better by knowing each other.\n\nHermes, Tāne/Māui and Legba Hermes is the ancient Greek agent of communication and provides for the term hermeneutics, which in the Western academy stands for interpretative method.6 In the Homeric Hymn, Hermes must mature from a cunning child thief of cattle, representing the primitive pastoral tribes, to an adult who, via a binding oath to his elder brother Apollo, becomes a subordinate messenger to Olympus, the agent of commerce and city-state diplomacy.7 Hermes is therefore colonized by Homer and forced into urban civilization. I want to decolonize this personality. The St Lucian poet Derek Walcott compares the islands of the Caribbean with the Aegean and suggests that if the ancient Greeks were resurrected today\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 14\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n15\n\nthey would be considered Puerto Ricans – brown, gaudy, sensual etc.8 So, following Walcott, let us cast aside a certain ‘progressive’ narrative of Greek development that mirrors the fatal impact thesis of moderns – from myth and magic to reason, philosophy and history. Let us instead acknowledge that the magic of Hermes possesses its own rationalities.9 Before and besides the Homeric Hymn, Hermes appears as part of nature – a force in life, death and regeneration.10 And rather than city-states, Hermes’ provenance is the pastoral province of Arcadia.11 There, he is the agent of the crossroads, of pathways that intersect, of thresholds and boundary stones.12 As spiritual agent of the traveller, Hermes possesses the magic of translation that must be utilized when crossing from one domain to another. This magic, or ‘skill at the oath’, is not quite deceit or wilful misdirection and neither is it a use of trickery.13 In fact, the Greek word for trick can also be glossed as ‘technical skill’;14 and magic more accurately infers the act of binding together.15 Hermes’ prime skill, therefore, is to bind together different domains – geographical, social, spiritual. In this respect, Hermes is the quintessential craftsman and sometimes appears in Attic dramas as the ‘heavenly counterpart of the menial labourer’.16 Hence, despite his propensity for trickery, Hermes is considered the giver of good things to those in need. His regenerative force might even be intentionally wielded to address issues of redistribution and restitution. I choose, therefore, to dispense with Homeric Hermes, the colonized messenger, and resurrect the Arcadian Hermes who is concerned with creatively cultivating knowledge of deep relations for the restitution of colonial wrongs. Why ‘deep’? Because the domains that are being bound back together reach to the seedbed of creation; we are not concerned here only with the cause-and-effect laws of the manifest domain. Moreover, unlike Homeric Hermes, Arcadian Hermes is not the supreme and singular messenger of the gods; he is a mundane agent rather than an exceptional world-historical figure masquerading as the colonizing European modern. Thus, the science and skill of deep relation that Hermes holds can be found everywhen and everywhere. So let us meet some of Hermes’ contemporaries.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 15\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n16\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nMāori cosmologies speak of an entity known as Tāne (occasionally Tiki) who is the progenitor of humankind and of forest life. Tāne forcibly separates his parents Papatūānuku (earth mother) and Ranginui (sky father) from their loving embrace thereby creating the space within which humans live.17 Yet Tāne also races against his evil brother Te-ika-a-whiro to ascend to the realm of Io-mata-ngaro (the begotten, i.e. the hidden face) in order to bring back to the manifest domain of human beings the three baskets of knowledge.18 Tāne, similarly to Hermes, is a generative force of human life and also a ‘messenger of the gods’ to the extent that he translates their sublime knowledge so that humans might live well in the manifest world. In short, Tāne creates meaningful human life by redeeming deep relation between the manifest and spiritual domains that he himself had rent asunder. In this respect, Tāne embodies a fundamental predicament but also ethos of humanity: to relate, that is (to follow the Latin etymology of the word), bring back – re-bind – that which has been rent asunder. However, the skill of binding together different domains is practised most acutely in Māori cosmologies by Māui. Māui is well known throughout Oceania, although he is always integrated in particular ways into particular cultural constellations.19 Here I follow the key contours of North Island Māori narratives. Māui is neither good nor absolutely bad, but he is a great voyager and, like Hermes, well practised in trickery, especially in changing shape. Māui utilizes these skills in order to shape the environment of the manifest world such that it is better suited for human habitation.20 For example, Māui tricks Mahukia into giving to humanity the technology of fire; and Māui ensnares the sun, and forces it to travel more slowly so that the day might be longer in which humans can perform useful activity.21 In this respect, one of Māui’s key characteristics is the will power he exercises in order to meet his objective. This wilfulness is partly related to Māui’s low-born status. He is, in fact, a miscarried foetus, and survives initially in the sea before being found and cared for by a surrogate family.22 So in his endeavours Māui often seeks to overcome his lowly status.23 And for this, he regularly breaks tapu (a state of sacredness).\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 16\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n17\n\nHere we might note that the ethos of humanity – to relate – is closely linked to the pursuit of restitutive justice. Māui’s fate is eventually sealed when he attempts to break the ultimate tapu and climb back into his ancestress Hine-nui-te-po, who crushes him by closing her thighs.24 Cognizant of this warning, I want to assert that the restitutive ethos of humanity is not an imperial process of convergence that seeks to homogenize all the diverse experiences of humanity and dimensions of existence. Rather, the act of binding implicates diverse but relatable matters, and hence this ethos of humanity should be conceived of as a wilful relating. Indeed, this wilfulness is suggested by Māui’s very name. Mā can be glossed as to be freed of the restrictions of tapu (a state of sacredness); and ui can be glossed as to ask or inquire. So Māui embodies the skill of open inquiry in order to creatively make a path.25 This creativity borders on the irreverent; however, it does not seek to destroy but rather to manipulate arrangements, perhaps even for the purpose of addressing injustices. Thus I submit that the Tāne/Māui complex embodies a decolonial science of deep relation, that is, the binding back together of different domains in order to cultivate useful knowledge through which to provide restitution for a disadvantaged social position. A cognate personality to Tāne/Māui exists in many cosmologies of the African Diaspora, that is, those persons and their descendants trafficked to work enslaved on the plantations of the Americas (as well as South-East Asia and elsewhere). Legba, a key personality in West African Fon cosmology, is one such agent who dwells at the thresholds of temples and houses.26 Legba is also present at the threshold of communications between humans.27 As the interpreter of fate Legba enjoys a close relationship to Fa, who rules over divination and expresses the destiny of the cosmos.28 Fa resides on the top of her tree, and every night Legba climbs up to open the eyes of his sister to survey the manifest world.29 In this respect, Legba, similar to Tāne, moves between the manifest and spiritual domains, especially by revealing to human beings their fates but also, similarly to Māui, by providing them with the ability to ‘trick’ fate, i.e. to utilize certain binding skills to their advantage.30\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 17\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n18\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nSimilar to Arcadian Hermes, Legba is a trickster who cannot be relied upon, yet is nonetheless a guardian of human beings.31 There is, moreover, a restitutive aspect to Legba’s relationship with humanity, an aspect that can also be gleaned in Tāne/Māui. As time goes by, human beings remember Fa (destiny) yet forget Legba (malleable fate). In fact, wars break out because those who have been given kingdoms have forgotten the language of their parents. Legba must be remembered, even if only by certain pivotal people, so that fate can be ‘tricked’ and war cease.32 In this respect, Legba embodies a certain irreverence to ordained fates, as does Māui. And this characteristic takes on especial importance in the African Diaspora with regards to reparation for the wounds of enslavement. In this book we will walk at different times with both the continental and diasporic children of Legba. However, while diverse articulations of Legba exist in West African cultures, in this chapter I will focus more on the diasporic children’s conceptions. For the enslaved that are forced to make the middle passage, Legba’s prime aspect becomes that of the gatekeeper,33 his key purpose: to provide redemption from the fate of slavery.34 In Haitian Vodou, Legba stands at the crossroads between the manifest world of humans and the spiritual realms of loa (spiritual agencies), domains that map respectively onto the Americas – the place of plantations, enslavement and suffering – and the domain of the island below the sea, populated by the ancestral and spiritual agencies of Guinea (Africa).35 Legba helps the diasporic sufferers in the manifest domain to repair the breach with the spiritual domain that has rendered them dehumanized. He does so by facilitating useful communication between manifest beings and their ancestors/spirits. For those who dare, Legba might be mobilized for even grander schemes of redemption, that is, repatriation out of the living death of the American plantations to African homelands. By these means, the colonial destiny (Fa) of enslavement might be reduced to a malleable fate (Legba) to be decided through liberation struggles. In sum, Tāne/Māui and Legba (as well as Arcadian Hermes) are personalities that embody the creative cultivation of deep relation.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 18\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n19\n\nTheir magic, i.e. their decolonial science, binds different domains together – individual, social, geographical and spiritual – in the pursuit of restitutive justice. The problem of binding back together is germane to the human condition. It is not a colonial creation. Colonial science was never that innovative. We will, nevertheless, dwell in the particular dispensation of this problem caused by the European colonial science of segregation, which stands opposed to the decolonial science of cultivating deep relation.36 A brief excursus into anthropology can help us to clarify this difference.\n\nCategorical segregation versus deep relation Let us recall the image of the Graphic’s imperial world map that I discussed in the last chapter. In the first part of the twentieth century, anthropologists made claim to the method of ethnography, that is, the examination of other cultures from a position of intimacy usually achieved through extended fieldwork in a native community. The term ethnography has a Greek provenance, referring to the study of foreign places in order to construct the difference and distance between there and home.37 In this sense, the expectations of ethnographic writing diverge from the cultivation of deep relation. Indeed, ethnography, as a tool of colonial administration, sought to mark, justify and police precisely the categorical difference between native and modern. And it is this ethnographic gaze that is behind the Graphic’s imperial world map, fixing the subaltern in its subordination to Britannica. Caught in this ethnographic gaze, Tāne/Māui and Legba could never relate to each other (or with an Arcadian Hermes) because, as non-moderns, they do not possess the competency to interrelate; they are merely ‘unreflexive’ agents, practising the old mystic arts of magic and trickery. To become competent, therefore, Tāne/Māui and Legba would have to look to a third force – a modernizing force of self-reflexivity – that could render the meaning of their actions on their behalf.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 19\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n20\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nWith independence from colonial rule, many traditional ethnographic sites became less easily accessible to Western anthropologists as the peripheral characters began to take back their own voices on the world stage. In this new era the supposedly higher sciences of translation and interpretation practised by the white ethnographer were at least partially revealed to be simply political instruments of colonial rule.38 We should be careful to suppose that anthropological inquiry is incapable of breaking out of colonial science.39 Nevertheless it is still rare to find studies that engage with the relationship of (post)colonized to each other ‘sideways’ without having to call upon Britannica to interpret and provide the meaning of these relationships.40 How might deep relation be a different practice of knowledge cultivation to that of categorical segregation? We must start by acknowledging that the manifest world is a broadly (post)colonial one, structured through imperial hierarchies that encourage the one-way transmission of political authority, social relations and knowledge from the centres outwards. But Tāne/Māui and Legba use their skills to bind this manifest domain to the hinterlands of the spiritual domains wherein colonial logic and lore is certainly an intrusion, although only an intrusion, and not a foundation. This is why I term this particular aspect of the spiritual domain as ‘hinterland’, that is, a space that has not been colonized yet faces the colonial frontier. Most importantly, the spiritual hinterlands provide the expanded agency to redress colonial fates in the manifest domain by providing the compass and energy store for anti-colonial self-determination.41 With these points in mind let us return to Tāne and his retrieval of the three baskets of knowledge from the begotten domain of Io-mata-kore, as detailed by the scholar Māori Marsden. In one basket lies knowledge of Te Ao Tua-ātea – the world beyond space-time. This is the ultimate sublime reality – of the spirit, of potential, and of the first cause (Io-taketake). It is also the condition from which and towards which the cosmos as a whole is tending.42 In another basket is knowledge of Tua-uri, dark worlds (te pō) that are nevertheless the ‘seedbed of creation’ wherein space-time is gestated, evolves and\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 20\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n21\n\nrefined, ultimately, into the various and specialized manifestations of the natural world. In these sublime worlds, hau-ora [the breath of life] begets shapes, shape begets form, form begets space, space begets time and time begets Rangi and Papa.43 Ranginui the sky father and Papatūānuku the earth mother embrace each other in this world of becoming until Tāne forces their separation and births Te Ao Mārama – the manifest world of light. This, then, leads us to the final basket of knowledge of Te Aro-nui, the natural world of being that can be apprehended through our senses in terms of events, sequences, cycles, regularities and, in general, relations of cause and effect.44 In recounting this genealogy of creation, Māori Marsden is at pains to point out that different domains have different competencies, traits and purposes. This point resonates with the caution that I took from Māui’s ultimate fate. In short, the binding skills of Tāne/Māui do not seek to collapse domains but, rather, to make their agents relatable and their energies traversable. We might also remember that Tāne, after causing a breach that creates the manifest world, seeks knowledge through which to repair the breach. I have suggested that this could be considered an ethos of humanity, one that requires a science. And in this science of deep relation, the material must be apprehended as material-and-spiritual, whereas in colonial science the spiritual must be profaned, that is, it must be transmogrified into a material cause (or ideology or symbol) so as to be captured by imperial logic. We must now examine how these binding skills open temporal and spatial pathways that subvert the colonial segregations that structure the manifest domain. Let us first examine the temporalities that allow colonized history to be displaced by decolonial pasts.45 Contrary to a developmentalist understanding of time, which is focused upon the creation of a pristine future, both Tāne/Māui and Legba practise deep relation as, principally, the reparation of ancestral ties.46 In Te Reo (the Māori language), mua functions both as a locative indicating in front and also the past, while muri indicates behind and also the future. Therefore, the future is behind us, because it is unknown and yet to be inhabited. The past, however, are the days\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 21\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n22\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nwhich lie in front (ngā rā o mua).47 This temporal orientation can also be identified in cosmologies associated with Legba. One Akan symbol that has gained popularity among enslaved Africans and their descendants is Sankofa – a bird that looks back to take an egg off its back. The imperative of Sankofa, meaning to ‘go back and take’, is to retrieve valuable heritage for the present day.48 Likewise, Haitian Vodou ceremonies will often begin by halting profane time; the hougan (priest) will emerge out of a sacred chamber in a backward motion orientating the congregation forward to the first human and ultimately to the godhead, the source of all cosmic agency and relation.49 The RasTafari faith provides a short-hand for this temporality: the ‘i-ncient [ancient] future’.50 Legba facilitates a reparative process by way of this temporal sensibility. He stands at the crossroads, a site of orientation.51 The cosmogram of the crossroads is composed of a vertical pole that denotes the centre of the world while the horizontal pole denotes the boundary of water called nzadi – the great river – that separates the mountains of the manifest (alive) and the spiritual (alive other-wise) that are nevertheless connected at their bases under the water.52 The greater the distance between these two mountains the more that equilibrium is required by means of communication between the entities of the two domains.53 In many faith systems in the African Diaspora, that great river is the Atlantic and great polarity had been created by the human traffic crossing it. Thus, even greater skill would be required for the enslaved if they were to repair the breach, escape the lands of death (Americas) and return to the lands of the living (Guinea).54 These temporal orientations provide a means to heal the colonial wound of segregation in so far as they bind post(colonized) peoples back to their ancestors and other spiritual agents that are not subaltern but still-living entities with their own integrity. Colonized presents cannot be sutured by uninhabited futures but by meaningful, already inhabited pasts. Moreover, the temporal (re-)orientation of decolonial science enables and requires the cultivation of different spatialities and relationalities that are also categorically ruled out by colonial science.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 22\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n23\n\nIn the manifest domain of colonial governance, entities are racially segregated into enslaved, indentured, native, free poor and masters. None can relate sideways to each other. They are fixated by the gaze of Britannica, the master. However, Legba allows for these segregations to be re-rendered as meaningful relations by binding together the manifest and spiritual domains, and the colonial present back to decolonial pasts. Ultimately such binding is made possible because the spiritual hinterlands are arranged not according to colonial logics of segregation but to those of relation. For instance, in the Caribbean island of St Vincent, the Converted, an African Baptist faith, practise spiritual journeying through which they will receive guidance for problems that plague their everyday life. In this journeying they freely visit Africa, India and China – originating regions of the various labourers brought to the islands by British colonialism. They might also visit Ethiopians, ‘a tribe of very small, eerie dark people in Africa’; however, in order to meet them the ‘tone has to be deep in the Spirit’ of the sojourner.55 Samoan writer Sia Figiel poetically expresses a similar science of deep relating for those who journey with Tāne/Māui: alofa [love] for the dead that live inside us nurturing our imaginations of ancestors across continents across time and space.56\n\nTherefore, instead of fatalism in the face of manifest colonial domination, Tāne/Māui and Legba turn cause and effect to run forward in order to redeem the past. And when the past is redeemed as a living site of anti-colonial agency, the spiritual hinterlands can redeem relationships between peoples segregated by the manifest forms of colonial rule. What is more, if Tāne/Māui and Legba are walking together in the spiritual hinterlands, their children might be moved to do the same in the manifest domain. Thus, beyond the imperial gaze, subalterns cease to be as they relate to each other as other persons of integrity; the ancestors are meeting because we have met. We can mark this material-and-spiritual relationality with\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 23\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n24\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nthe Māori term tātou tātou, that is, ‘all of us and all of us’, meaning, everyone must be recognized as relatable entities rather than as categorically segregated objects. In this section I have not made statements of belief. Neither have I been trying to convince you to believe with me. Rather, my statements are avowedly substantive – ontological, even. The material is materialand-spiritual. Temporalities that bind back together the material and spiritual also bind (post)colonial presents back to decolonial pasts as well as persons and collectives spatially segregated by colonial logics. Knowledge is cultivated as part of this political pursuit, and that is decolonial science. This science is not waiting to be profaned in order to become a higher-order science of modern self-reflexivity for that would be, first and foremost, an imperial move rather than an epistemic revolution.57 As Māori Marsden confirms, it is certainly true that profane matter has its own competencies. Nevertheless, these competencies manifest quite late in the day in cosmological terms and do not constitute the deep structures of existence. We have arrived, then, at the prospect of a radical expansion of agency made possible in the practice of binding together the manifest and sublime domains so as to redeem and refigure the past in an expanded and interconnected global arena. My concerns in this book are to apprehend this expansion of agency and energy as part of a pursuit of global justice in colonial conditions that practically and epistemically outlaw such pursuits, relationships and solidarities. I now elaborate on the particular skill of relating practised by Tāne/Māui and Legba known as ‘grounding’.\n\nGrounding To my mind, decolonial science cultivates knowledge, it does not produce knowledge. Using the Latin roots of these words, we could say that to produce knowledge is to lengthen, prolong or extend,\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 24\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n25\n\nwhereas to cultivate knowledge is to till, to turn matter around and fold back on itself so as to rebind and encourage growth. Knowledge production is less a creative endeavour and more a process of accumulation and imperial extension so that (post)colonized peoples could only consume or extend someone else’s knowledge (of themselves).58 In short, a colonial science produces knowledge of and for subalterns. Alternatively, knowledge cultivation is a necessarily creative pursuit as it requires the practitioner to turn over and oxygenate the past. Most importantly, cultivation also infers habitation, which means that knowledge is creatively released as the practitioner enfolds her/himself in the communal matter of her/his inquiry. What is more, this constant oxygenation process – a circulatory one – necessarily interacts with a wider biotope, enfolding matter from other habitations. To cultivate knowledge of deep relation can therefore be understood as ‘grounding’. In Māori cosmology, the manifest world is created when Tāne separates Ranginui from Papatūānuku. Specifically, Papatūānuku refers to the sublime aspect of whenua – the manifest earth.59 Whenua (land) is therefore never just a material object, because it connects the manifest world back to the seedbed of creation. Inhabitation is an enaction of creation; hence the term tūrangawaewae – glossed as ‘stomping ground’ but more accurately rendered as ‘to stand is to be’.60 This is why the land is an ancestor to human beings.61 With regards to these considerations the term whakapapa takes on great importance. In a quotidian sense whakapapa can be glossed as ‘genealogy’; for example, ‘who do you whakapapa to?’ means ‘what are your tribal affiliations?’ More accurately, however, whaka means to make or cause, and papa refers to ground or foundation. So whakapapa can be glossed as ‘to make a ground/foundation’;62 and because of the constitutive relationship of land to being, the act of whakapapa is in many ways an enaction of creation. As part of a decolonial science, whakapapa proposes that ‘to understand phenomena we must understand relationship’.63 And one of the key structuring principles of whakapapa is the relationship between junior (tēina) and senior (tuākana) relations. While this principle is\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 25\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n26\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nheavily implicated in the web of family and tribal structures, it also operates on a broader cosmological scale: manifest entities hold a junior relation (tēina) to those senior entities (tuākana) that inhabit the spiritual domain. This being said, although whakapapa expresses hierarchical relations, these are always multiple and overlapping. Indeed, one of the most signal qualities of Te Ao Māori (the Māori world) is just how many diverse and sometimes conflicting stories peoples have of themselves and of their relationships.64 Hence whakapapa are, to a certain extent, malleable. It is possible, for example, to identify more strongly with a junior descent line (tēina) than a senior (tuākana) or with one’s matrilineal lines more than with patrilineal lines.65 The qualified malleability of whakapapa is amenable to the creative path making that is a signal quality of Māui’s skills.66 Indeed, the retrieval of particular lines and ancestors can be creatively mobilized to address present-day challenges. For example, if a child is taught the skill of weaving they might not only be taught about Hine-te-iwaiwa, the originator of the skill, but perhaps also about an ancestor who was noted for the skill.67 Many of the people who I have cultivated relationships with in the course of writing this book similarly explain their presentday work, politics and direction by intentional reference to particular tūpuna (ancestors) and the living legacies that they now embody. In this respect, whakapapa is not only a practice that concerns personal genealogy but can also be mobilized to relate through common experiences or the pursuit of common purpose.68 For instance, in explaining how the Black Power gang should be more accurately considered an iwi (tribe), Eugene Ryder, Wellington spokesperson, mobilizes the concept of whakapapa. Iwi, like all collective groups, constitute themselves through their genealogy. But what binds Black Power members, argues Ryder, is not so much common personal lines of descent (although they can be these too), but, more so, common lines of purpose to which they are all committed, often inter-generationally so. Thus Ryder is a member of a number of iwi: Ngāti Kahu – his personal genealogical line – and Mangu Kaha (Black Power) – his line of purpose.69\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 26\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n27\n\nIn sum, whakapapa provides for the ‘ultimate catalogue’ of relations between people and all other entities in the manifest and spiritual domains – flora, fauna, land, ancestors, spiritual agencies etc.70 Indeed, mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge systems) are themselves organized through whakapapa and usually communicated by narrative, as is the case with Māori Marsden’s cosmological recital that I rehearsed above.71 All entities – tangible and intangible – are therefore related as part of creation. Less a passive rehearsal of genealogy, whakapapa is much more an intentional and creative (re-)cultivation of relations that constitute the cosmos, announced to the world in the form of storytelling (whaikōrero). Whakapapa demands persons to ‘know their foundations and embrace a diverse humanity’.72 To be and to know, absent of relating, is unthinkable. This is why the tūpuna (ancestors) teach that one must always ‘whakapapa to the world’.73 In this way, knowledge cultivation through whakapapa epistemically and ethically demands the enfolding of diverse matters into the habitation of indi­genous being. Perhaps, then, oceans (Pacific and Atlantic) and racial categorizations (black and brown) are only manifest barriers to peoples that can be bound back together at deeper levels. A ground can always be creatively prepared for relating. Legba, keeper of the crossroads, is invoked in the ‘invisible institutions’ – the secret night-time congregations of enslaved peoples on plantations presided over by fellow enslaved preachers and prophets.74 In the emergency conditions of the plantation, worship had to be physically and spiritually sheltered from the overseers and masters. In the 1930s and 1940s Caribbean, adherents of the RasTafari faith began the next iteration of this tradition.75 Elder Bongo Spear notes that secluded meetings among RasTafari became synonymous with a theocratic assembly called the Nyahbinghi Order.76 Referring back to a set of nineteenth-century religious and political movements in central Africa against European colonialism, Nyahbinghi came to denote a cardinal imperative of the RasTafari faith: (spiritual) death to all black and white oppressors.77 The Nyahbinghi began to call their collective deliberations ‘grounations’. Cognate to whakapapa, but adding an\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 27\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\n28\n\nexplicitly political impulse, grounation etymologically brings together ground, foundation and nation.78 As such, grounation announces the binding together of manifest and spiritual domains guided by the collective pursuit of self-determination. At grounation, reasoning, chants, prayers and meditation enable the faithful to be rejuvenated in order to focus on ‘chanting down Babylon’, quickening repatriation, and fulfilling the Nyahbinghi creed – the hungry be fed, the naked clothed, the sick nourished, the ancients protected, and the infants cared for.79 Marijuana, the sacramental herb or ‘wisdom weed’, is consumed because it opens up the I-tes (the heights, the spiritual domain, the intellect). A ‘fire key’ is lit with the recitation of a set of Psalms that affirm salvation and refuge for the faithful and brimstone for the wicked.80 Drums (or ‘harps’) are played for the duration of the congregation, their volume, style and speed varying according to the reasoning taking place and its affect upon the congregation. At grounation these various technologies facilitate the binding together of manifest and spiritual domains in order to bring Zion to earth in the pursuit of African liberation, as testified to in this popular rhyme: Natty dread shake him locks And a lightning clap And a weak heart drap! [drop]81\n\nIt is true, though, that RasTafari do not expressly practise the same kind of ancestor veneration as many African Diasporic faiths.82 This is an important observation in so far as it indicates that the RasTafari apprehension of spiritual intercession is also different from many indigenous practices. Nevertheless, I would argue that this difference is strategic and contextual rather than existential. Confronting the legacy of slavery as a living death, RasTafari disavow any notion of dying and hence pursue a more dramatic intercession for ‘more life’ via the powers of the Most High manifest in the human and living persona of the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie I, alongside Empress Menen Asfaw. Direct intercession is, in fact, a component of much African\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 28\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n29\n\nancestor veneration, although such a practice is only to be utilized in circumstances of extreme danger.83 I submit that kidnapping, trafficking, enslavement and dehumanization can be considered as extremely dangerous circumstances. In this sense, the absence of direct ancestor veneration in RasTafari does not necessarily infer the absence of ancestors. Witness, for example, elder Bongo Ketu who explains that at grounation, ‘when a skill man play ’pon de peta [repeater], de drums bring forth de spirits of all de Ancients … de drum is de ancient Ethiopian form of communication’.84 While grounations are somewhat formal affairs, the practice of grounding is more often than not quotidian as is the case with the face-to-face practising of whakapapa.85 And wherever RasTafari ground, they cultivate knowledge other-wise to the Babylonian institutions of knowledge production. Walter Rodney, the famous Guyanese academic and activist, returns to the University of West Indies (his alma mater) to teach in 1968. He relocates his classroom from the Mona campus to the shanties of downtown Kingston. There, Rodney and members of the RasTafari faith take part in informal grounding sessions, exchanging views on African history, politics and the liberation struggles.86 Rodney comes with dead books but is ‘amazed’ at the living practices of knowledge cultivation pursued by RasTafari, the way in which they are able to traverse the segregations of colonial science, retrieve African personhood from ‘thingification’,87 and recentre the peripheral and marginalized sufferers within a deep set of supportive and emancipatory relations.88 As is the case with whakapapa, RasTafari grounding tends to exceed its immediate habitation among the African Diaspora. The RasTafari pronoun ‘I and I’ is similar to tātou tātou, and specifically infers that my sanctified being must also be directly relatable to your sanctified being; the RasTafari pronoun for ‘you’ is, in fact, ‘the I’. Additionally, RasTafari make use of ‘spiritual anthropology’, based on African fractal aesthetics, wherein research is ‘insearch’, i.e. what is inside is outside.89 Sociological and/or racial segregational categorizations (native/negro, red, brown/black) cannot therefore frame grounding between I and I.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 29\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n30\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nRather, as is the case with African Baptists, RasTafari ground across these lines. For instance, RasTafari consider the Americas in general to be indigenous land and First Nation spiritual practices to be cognate to their own, especially in terms of the use of drums, fire and sacraments.90 These considerations are manifested, whenever appropriate. Hence, the grounation that inaugurated the First International Gathering of RasTafari in May 1994 took place among the Miccosukee people of north-east Florida.\n\nGrounding in Aotearoa NZ Tāne/Māui and Legba have forged for us a decolonial science of deep relation that utilizes a key skill: the creative preparation of a ground for relating. Their decolonial science seeks restitution as a general ethos of humanity, but specifically as an anti-colonial pursuit, and will enable us to come to terms with a global infrastructure of anti-colonial connectivity that exists underneath and surreptitiously runs through the imperial hierarchy of Britannica. This decolonial science seeks to bind the manifest colonized world back to the uncolonized spiritual hinterlands, the colonized present back to decolonial pasts, (post) colonized peoples to other (post)colonized peoples, and the children of Legba to the children of Tāne/Māui. Perhaps even the children of Arcadian Hermes might have a part to play – or a relation to redeem – in this enterprise. But the deep relation that we are retrieving in this book is of Africa in Oceania. And Oceania – specifically Aotearoa NZ – is not vacant nor a neutral space but one that is already inhabited. As a child of Legba I must address the fact that I am cultivating knowledge of the children of Tāne/Māui, on their own grounds. What, then, might be the ethical and methodological directives of this pursuit? Here I follow the advice of Manuka Henare on the terms of engagement between tauiwi (non-Māori) and mātauranga Māori\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 30\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n31\n\n(Māori knowledges). Henare affirms that there are particular stories whose guardians are particular groups – whānau (family), and hapū and iwi (larger social and political constellations). In these cases, the ethical and methodological imperative of knowledge cultivation addresses a primary question: ‘who are the appropriate guardians’. Social science imperatives of ‘(how) can I extract the knowledge’ must be subservient to the addressing of this primary question. After all, the principle of rightful guardianship (kaitiaki) is of foremost concern, especially when stories, as whakapapa, constitute being itself. Yet Henare argues that there also exists a narrative that congenitally folds within itself numerous groups – Māori and tauiwi (non-Māori) – and is therefore, in principle, much more open to cultivation by all who feel compelled to claim an investment in it. This is the story of pan-Māori self-determination (mana motuhake) integrally connected to the arrival and building of relationships with Pākehā (European settlers).91 I would respectfully add that the tauiwi (non-Māori) in this story are constituted by more multiple and diverse peoples than European settlers. Landmarks of this multicultural story include the Māori Declaration of Independence in 1835 (He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga), the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi) in 1840, the emergence of the Kīngitanga (the Māori King Movement) in the 1850s as a response to breaches to Te Tiriti, and the renaissances of mana motuhake (self-determination) in the 1970s and 80s. I situate my engagement on these terms. That is, I retrieve the deep relation between the descendants of Africa and Oceania as part of the broader politics and narrative of the pan-Māori anti-colonial struggle for mana motuhake, a struggle that must involve tātou tātou – I and I. Let me finish by rehearsing the cardinal skills of decolonial science that we have examined in this chapter. Grounding signals the cultivation of deep relation by variously binding different domains together. These domains are fundamentally the material and spiritual, domains that necessarily also enfold present and past, living and ancestors, and tātou tātou – persons and persons. For the purposes of this book, whenever an intentional attempt is being made by persons at some\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 31\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n32\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nkind of binding along these lines (even in the absence of face-to-face relations) then grounding is taking place. Whakapapa is the particular expression and organization of these relations in the form of stories, or more accurately, as enactions of (a part of) creation, i.e. stories of creative constitution. Crucially, whakapapa do not simply describe mundane and material causal relations. Certainly, whakapapa cannot be composed out of fiction; however, their composition is an intentional, wilful rearrangement. In other words, there is a significant restitutive element to whakapapa – a creative redeeming of deep relation that material causality is in the service of rather than the master over. At various points in the book, I will recite whakapapa that will intentionally and creatively retrieve the depth of the grounding between the children of Tāne/Māui and Legba. Many of the chapters in this book cluster around the time period of the 1970s and 1980s. However, the narrative of the book is not ordered chronologically; instead, its flow should be apprehended as an expression of a deepening relation with all its contentions. However, there are many crossroads along the way, delineated by the chapters of the book. As we proceed through the chapters, this contentious and staged deepening of relations between the children of Tāne/Māui and Legba will be signalled in the following movement: from comparison, to identification, to inhabitation and finally to enfolding. The following chapters pursue the project of mana motuhake with this compass in hand. We begin in the late 1960s and 1970s when Māori activists start to compare their struggles and strategies with those of the Black Power movement of the USA. Here, the children of Tāne/Māui and Legba attempt to bind themselves together within the public sphere of the manifest domain, and they start to glean their deep relation through comparative exercises. But it is a contentious process. They then journey deeper into the relation and move from comparisons with Black Power to identifications with Blackness in public and personal arenas. We walk some way in this direction with the Polynesian Panthers, the struggles over sports and Apartheid, and the Black Women’s Movement. Then we move from political\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 32\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nDeep Relation\n\n33\n\nBlackness to spiritual and aesthetic Blackness, witnessing theological engagements with Black liberation and artistic projects that attempt to mobilize Black liberation for decolonial ends. At this point the children of Arcadian Hermes appear, seeking to appropriately support this deepening identification. We then travel deeper still, from identification to mutual inhabitation in the arena of faith. We examine RasTafari as a faith of the children of Legba that the children of Tāne/Māui inhabit on their own grounds and terms. Subsequently we travel into the spiritual hinterlands using the Māori prophets of the nineteenth century as our vessel. There we find Tāne/Māui and Legba walking together in anti-colonial solidarity as the biblical Shem and Ham. We return to the present materialand-spiritual domain to witness how these traversable energies enfold RasTafari into the indigenous and endogenous prophetic traditions of Aotearoa NZ. Finally, we rehearse a general whakapapa of Africa in Oceania, and in so doing, make the greeting between ancestors at Te Hāpua intelligible as part of a deep, global infrastructure of anticolonial connectivity.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 33\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 34\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n2\n\nBlack Power and Mana Motuhake\n\nIntroduction In the decade immediately following the Second World War, the percentage of Māori living in urban areas – as opposed to their mainly rural tūrangawaewae (places of belonging) – rose dramatically from approximately 35 per cent to over 60 per cent. The Hunn report of 1961, written for the Department of Māori Affairs, announced the official thinking on this development. The report recognized that the Māori population, long considered moribund, was now growing and urbanizing at a rate that was outstripping extant infrastructures. At the same time, however, the report actively promoted urbanization by encouraging Crown purchase of Māori land to facilitate development programmes, even while acknowledging that employment for Māori would be a future problem. The report proposed in a distinctly colonial-racial language that the ‘integration’ of Māori into predominantly Pākehā (settler European) urban areas had a modernizing effect on those who were ‘complacently living a backward life in primitive conditions’.1 Complicating but in many ways intensifying this confluence of urbanization, racism and assimilation was the migration of Tangata Pasifika (peoples of Oceania) over the same time period. Old colonial links with Western Samoa, Niue, Tokelau, Tonga and the Cook Islands were used to encourage unskilled and semiskilled labourers into urban industry, especially around Auckland.2 By the late 1960s Pākehā media and politicians had framed these migrations in terms of a ‘Polynesian problem’. To their minds, the\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 35\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n36\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nproblem was exemplified by a growing number of youth who seemed unable to integrate into the mainstream structures of urban life and preferred, instead, to hang out on the streets in groups.3 Pākehā thought was occupied with the ways in which this phenomenon could be explained in terms of the pathologies of ‘backward’ Māori and Pasifika cultures. But Māori and Pasifika youth experienced their ‘problem’ in radically different ways: primarily through a sense of dislocation borne of living in urban areas run according to Pākehā rules and mores expressed through visceral and institutional racism. In this conjuncture a set of Māori and Pasifika activist movements arose that confronted the racist and colonial constitution of New Zealand society and state. This chapter examines the ways in which predominantly young and urban Māori activists compared the radical politics of Black Power in the USA to the struggle for mana motuhake (self-determination), a struggle that they sought to radicalize. There now exists a rich literature on the diverse expressions and global determinants of Black Power.4 In this and following chapters, I pick up the strands of Black Power that speak specifically to an oppositional aesthetic and ideology, to the practice of community self-sufficiency over dependency, to the redemption of Blackness as a positive mode of being expressed in Black love, and to a movement of spiritual liberation. In Aotearoa NZ the influence of Black Power upon Māori and Pasifika youth upset long-held mainstream assumptions that this particular settler society was exceptional in its enjoyment of racial harmony. However, for Māori youth Black Power also called into question the indigenous provenance of radical oppositional politics: were there no indigenous sources of Black Power? Engaging with these issues, we will witness the contentious ways in which the children of Tāne/Māui attempted to ground with the children of Legba in the public-political arena.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 36\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nBlack Power and Mana Motuhake\n\n37\n\nBlack Power and New Zealand exceptionalism By the late 1960s many Pākehā still held to the comforting myth that race relations in Aotearoa NZ, by comparison to the record of other settler colonies, were exceptionally good.5 Only a minority of Pākehā who had invested themselves in the race question were critically examining its domestic coordinates. Most had imbibed the exceptionalist narrative and, following a well-established tradition, were looking abroad for a struggle to morally support, which they found principally in the anti-Apartheid movement. At worst, any claims of racial oppression suffered by Māori or Pasifika in Aotearoa NZ were treated at the time with derision. At best, discrimination was considered merely a temporary occurrence due to the arrival in cities of ‘relatively unsophisticated immigrants’.6 It was in this climate that popular media started to make regular comparisons between the ‘Polynesian problem’ and the ‘Negro problem’ in the northern cities of the USA. Alarm bells rang over the assassination of Martin Luther King, the demise of the putatively accommodationist and peaceful civil rights movement that he represented, and its replacement by a putatively more violent and confrontational Black Power movement, exemplified in the popular imaginary by the Black Panthers.7 Black Power presented itself as an unwelcome and threatening import when refracted through the lens of New Zealand ‘exceptionalism’. And some started to worry that the disaffected and deracinated Polynesian youth might take a lesson from American Blacks and start burning Auckland and Wellington too. ‘We have seen in the USA the kind of violence that can erupt when a depressed minority reaches the point of hopelessness and no return’, noted a New Zealand Teachers Association report; ‘[w]e do not want to see such outbursts in our own … country’.8 Pākehā and Māori commentators alike tended to look for the flashpoint of Black Power radicalism among the unemployed and out-of-school youth who, congregating in groups, were apprehended\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 37\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\n38\n\n– in a somewhat sensationalist fashion – through the optic of American gangs.9 ‘Gang behaviour’, affirmed the Polynesian Institute, ‘shows manifestations in line with the distinct parallels of … American urban development.’10 Five years later, Te Roopu o te Matakite, an activist group that organized the pioneering Māori Land March of 1975, warned against the continued deracination of urban youth who would become ‘… a landless brown proletariat with no dignity, no mana [authority], and no stake in society. Like the Blacks in America, they will stand outside society and aggress against it.’11 Many Pākehā commentators parsed the gang problem through the narrative of New Zealand exceptionalism. For instance, Phil Amos, a Labour MP who had visited civil rights groups in the USA, was adamant that ‘we have nothing to learn [from Americans] on how to live in society as a whole’.12 One popular magazine took comfort in colonial stereotypes, suggesting that ‘the easy-going temperament of the Polynesian may be all that will save Auckland from some future Watts-type explosion’.13 Such responses weighted the onus of urban conflagration less on Pākehā racism and more on the pathologies of the Māori and Pasifika youth. But they were wilfully ignorant of the fact that the loose groups of Māori and Pasifika youth who comprised ‘racial gangs’ had in fact chosen their names – i.e. Nigs, Junior Nigs and Spades – from the racist expletives provided to them by Pākehā. Taura Eruera, a young Māori student activist, sought to dispel the comforting myths of exceptionalism and Polynesian pathology. Returning from a seventy-day study tour of minority communities in the USA, Eruera suggested that, we are always quick to assure ourselves that, compared to the USA, South Africa and Australia … race relations in New Zealand are fine. As a comparative study this is true. But when we … use this comparison as the basis for categorically stating that race relations in New Zealand are fine, we are kidding ourselves.14\n\nIn fact, Black Power rhetoric and thought had begun to infiltrate the prisons and education systems of Aotearoa NZ. And some even found it instructive for their own situation.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 38\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nBlack Power and Mana Motuhake\n\n39\n\nIn the early 1970s racism was already part of the institutional bedrock of the New Zealand criminal justice system. Convictions of Māori were substantially higher than those of Pākehā, and Māori child offenders were twice more likely to receive prison sentences than Pākehā.15 Similar to Black prison populations in North America, Black Power texts reached a captive audience. A newsletter written by prisoners and organized by a famous Pākehā non-conformist, Tim Shadbolt, devoted several pages examining the Black Panthers and Black Power. Following this exposition was an article written by an inmate agitating to ‘stand firm and bit [sic] back at the pigs, as our coloured brothers in America are doing’.16 Tellingly, the president of the King Cobras, a Pasifika gang, came out of prison brandishing Black Panther Bobby Seale’s book, Seize the Time.17 Black Power literature was also picked up in some secondary schools. For instance, at Hilary College in Ōtara, a South Auckland suburb, some teachers began to tune their students into the contemporary global struggle against racism and imperialism from the Vietcong to the Sandanistas.18 Continental and Diaspora African writers were also introduced, the history of Atlantic slavery was discussed, and some students began to follow Black Power politics with great interest.19 Similarly, interest in Black Power began to grow among university students, especially in the context of the passing of the Maori Affairs Amendment Act of 1967 that effectively made easier the compulsory acquisition and sale of putatively ‘un-economic’ Māori land held in freehold. Also in 1967, Jim Flynn, an American professor of political science and, at the time, chairperson for the USA civil rights organization, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), spoke to the Federation of Māori Students conference at Victoria University of Wellington. The topic of Flynn’s speech was a comparative analysis of race and class in the USA and Aotearoa NZ undertaken by a non-New Zealander.20 At Auckland University, another political science professor, Bob Chapman, introduced his Masters students to Black Power politics with some help from Flynn’s essays. One aspiring student of Chapman, Helen Clark, who would later become New Zealand Prime Minister and subsequently Administrator\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 39\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\n40\n\nof the United Nations Development Programme, wrote a comparative essay for Chapman on the Black Muslims and the Jamaican Pan-Africanist, Marcus Garvey.21 Atareta Poananga also attended Chapman’s classes and became a great admirer of Malcolm X. She would later become (in)famous when, working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she circulated a letter around the diplomatic core that chastised some of its Māori members by reference to Malcolm X’s house/field negro analogy.22 Syd Jackson was another Māori student of Chapman and read Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely Carmichael (whom he later met in person in Libya); he also studied African independence movements and sought to link their dynamics to the colonization of Oceania.23 The reception of Black Power by Māori and Pasifika youth radically undermined the exceptionalist narrative that outlawed any potential connection between anti-Black racism and anti-Polynesian racism. Some youth even started to consider that Black Power was relevant to Aotearoa NZ because white supremacy was a global system. A question thus crystallized: in what ways might and to what extent could Black Power express an indigenous articulation of radical, oppositional politics? This question was addressed most acutely by predominantly tertiary educated young Māori who congealed as a diverse group called Ngā Tamatoa.\n\nTe Aute Old Boys versus young warriors At this point we need to undertake a brief whakapapa of Māori student activism; specifically, we must retrieve the constitutive friction between reformist and radical strategies of pursuing mana motuhake. For this purpose, an important point of departure can be found in Te Aute College in Hawke’s Bay, opened in 1854 by Samuel Williams, son of Henry Williams and head of the Church Missionary Society in Aotearoa NZ. Apirana Ngata was the college’s most famous student who became\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 40\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nBlack Power and Mana Motuhake\n\n41\n\nthe first Māori to complete a university degree in 1893, and indeed, the key scholar who pushed for Māori studies in university.24 Ngata subsequently became the model Māori who worked in and through the institutions of settler colonialism in order to defend and forward mana motuhake, especially through the legal and economic consolidation of land holdings. Ngata’s famous poem captures his strategy for attaining radical ends through reformist means: E tipu e rea i ngā rā o tōu ao Ko tō ringaringa ki ngā rākau a te Pākehā Hei orange mō tō tinana Ko tō ngākau ki ngā taonga a ō tīpuna Hei tikitiki mō tō māhuna Ko tō wairua ki te Atua Nāna nei ngā mea katoa Grow child in the days of your world Grasp with your hand the tools of the Pākehā As a means to support your body Keep in your heart the knowledge of your ancestors As a topknot for your head And turn your spirit to the lord From whom all things come.25\n\nNgata returned to Te Aute in 1897 to help in the formation of an Old Boys Association. Those who joined understood themselves to be working for a physical, mental and spiritual Māori renaissance along the lines laid out by Ngata, that is, to imitate the material achievements of Pākehā civilization but on Māori terms.26 Eventually, members of the association would seek to make direct political interventions through the vehicle of the Young Māori Party.27 There was an inter-generational dynamic to Ngata’s renaissance project, for at times the young educated Māori would find themselves in opposition to the practices of their elders. The Old Boys Association therefore directed young people to rethink and reassess – sometimes contentiously – the existing strategies for initiating a Māori renaissance.\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 41\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n42\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\nIn formal terms there were long gaps between these inter-generational discussions. A Young Māori Leaders Conference took place in 1939, and another only in 1959. In the latter conference, the youth took on a more pronounced role in setting out the issues of the day, which even at this time were dominated by the gathering pace of rural to urban migration.28 Questions of leadership and the transmission of knowledge were also raised.29 Nevertheless, Ngata’s dictum remained by and large unchallenged: preserve the basic values of Māori culture – especially aroha and manaakitanga (affection and hospitality) – through a working understanding of Pākehā society.30 All this would be challenged in the next conference that took place at Auckland University in 1970. The 1970 conference addressed familiar problems of ongoing land alienation and the increasing urbanization of young Māori. Yet the disquiet and distance of the youth had reached new levels. Out of 100 delegates, 50 of which were actively participating, only 13 sat at the elders’ table; and a ‘sizeable number’ of radical students shared the space with gang members and workers.31 Perhaps the key point of inter-generational difference was the deracinating effect of urban living especially in terms of an intimate knowledge of Māori practices and Te Reo (language).32 One group consisting of Syd Jackson (Chapman’s student), Hana Te Hemara and Danny Harris (a former member of the Stormtrooper gang) criticized kaumātua (elders) for standing over the activities of the youth. Amplifying the complaints of the 1959 conference, Jackson et al. argued that what was really required of kaumātua was less active leadership and more transmission of language and culture to the urban youth.33 At the conclusion of the conference some of the Māori youth decided to create their own organization outside of the Te Aute tradition. With a membership open ‘to Polynesians under 30’,34 Ngā Tamatoa functioned, in the main, as a pressure group consisting of educated urban Māori.35 While Ngā Tamatoa cast their net of interests wide, it is fair to say that their predominant concern was the dislocation felt by a young generation many of whose families had memories and\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 42\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nBlack Power and Mana Motuhake\n\n43\n\nexperiences of living in their tūrangawaewae (place of belonging) but who lacked that cultural immersion themselves. The challenge, in this environment, was to avoid becoming what Danny Harris described as an ‘educated brown-Pākehā’.36 Ngā Tamatoa tackled discriminatory legislation and also contributed to community services such as prison visits and food co-ops.37 However, their prime aim was to build a bridge back to culture for dislocated youth by agitating for the teaching of Te Reo (Māori language) in primary and secondary schools.38 In the last chapter I noted that Māui’s irreverence at any given order is not necessarily a modernist one. That is, Māui does not desire to destroy a traditional order, but rather seeks to wilfully rearrange its constituents in the pursuit of restitutive justice. In fact, if we dispense with the ‘fatal impact’ thesis it is not so clear where conservative reform ends and oppositional radicalism begins. And for those young Māori who claimed the radical banner, their elders would sometimes remind them that they were actually seeking to conserve their heritages by regenerating them in the present context.39 In fact, these sentiments are evident in the selection of the name Ngā Tamatoa (the young warriors) itself, due to its ‘indigenous appeal’40 being also the title of the Māori battalion that had fought in the Second World War. Likewise, their motto, ‘Tama tū tama ora / Tama noho tama mate’ (stand up and live or lay down and die), captured the radical energy of Black Power but through a traditional whakataukī (proverb).41 While Ngata had sought to balance Pākehā means with Māori ends, the young warriors now saw their fluency in the Pākehā world as destructive and disabling of Māori ends: ‘The Māori just wants to be what he was and is, a Māori! He doesn’t want to be a brown skinned New Zealander. He is proud of his ancestors, and ancestral background, and he is proud of his customs and traditions.’42 In radicalizing the Te Aute strategy Ngā Tamatoa sought to reclaim another political whakapapa of mana motuhake. Specifically, they aimed to reconstitute the student tradition along the lines of the often oppositional resistances practised by ancestors such as Hone Heke, King Pōtatau and Te Kooti.43 Indeed, the personal whakapapa of some of the new warriors included these\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 43\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\n44\n\nThe Black Pacific\n\ntraditions. For instance, Hana Te Hemara’s grandmother was a member of the old Kotahitanga (unity) movement, and she grew up surrounded by a critique of ‘white greed and white aggression’.44 To this end, Ngā Tamatoa made their key battleground Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty). But instead of using the Te Aute Old Boys strategy of tactful debating with their ‘partners’, Ngā Tamatoa set out to publically disrupt the national celebrations at Waitangi in 1971. In doing so they claimed that the method of ‘courteous’ engagement with the question of Te Tiriti (The Treaty) had been ‘largely unsuccessful’, and Māori patience was not ‘limitless’.45 The response by elders was mixed. Pat Hohepa, an attendee of both the 1959 and 1970 leader conferences, described Ngā Tamatoa as the ‘real Māori’.46 And Hone Kaa, Anglican theologian and activist, later reflected that while Ngā Tamatoa were ‘totally un-Māori’, ‘city Māori’ and ‘the children of policies of integration’, they nevertheless ‘became my teachers and the revisers of my history’.47 This being said, Ngā Tamatoa’s strategy of radical opposition drove a wedge between them and the majority of their elders. Witness, for example, the 1975 Land March to Parliament that started from Te Hāpua at the tip of the North Island. While Ngā Tamatoa, especially their female members,48 had done much of the organizing for the march, the public face of the endeavour was respected kuia (elder woman) Whina Cooper. As the march arrived at parliament, members of Ngā Tamatoa, inspired by their aboriginal Black Power brethren and sistren across the Tasman Sea, erected a tent embassy in the grounds and refused to leave until substantive policy changes towards land governance had begun. Cooper distanced herself from these actions. Writing about Ngā Tamatoa to Matiu Rata, Minister of Māori Affairs, Cooper complained that ‘they are an embarrassment to not only our Maori people but the government of today in that they have not the courtesy to wait for your reply’.49\n\n9781472519238_txt_print.indd 44\n\n02/12/2014 09:24\n\nBlack Power and Mana Motuhake\n\n45\n\nAn indigenous Black Power? The attempts, at the turn of the 1970s, to retrieve a political whakapapa of mana motuhake impelled activists to ground with Black Power. I would argue that there are two reasons for this. First, Black Power in North America was predominantly the language of the youth living in racially fractured and majority white urban environments; many of them were one generation displaced from the rural South, the actual seedbed of the Black Power movement.50 This urban context also seems to have partly muted the ideological impact of First Nations struggles on Māori activists, despite the two peoples enjoying personal exchanges at the time.51 In a generational sense, then, young AfricanAmerican radicals spoke more directly to the situation of Māori youth than many of the latter’s kaumātua (elders). But second, as I have noted, Black Power had entered into the public psyche of Aotearoa NZ specifically as a radical challenge to the exceptionalist narrative. In this respect, Black Power could easily be dismissed as foreign fanaticism influencing the pliable mind of Māori youth. Through this mainstream presumption it was all too easy to argue, by extension, that the idea of an oppositional politics per se was not indigenous but rather an inauthentic ‘foreign’ invention/invasion. For these reasons the grounding was necessarily contentious. In fact, one group of Māori activists were directly concerned with addressing such assumptions and for this reason they sought to dismiss the idea that radical Māori were copying radical African Am"
