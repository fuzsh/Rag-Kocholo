The Eastern and Western Conference champions are battling it out in a best-of-seven series to claim the league title. Game 3 is in Dallas, and fans are buzzing with excitement. \n\nMeanwhile, here in New Zealand, we have our own basketball action with the National Basketball League. Wellington is proud to be home to the 12-time NBL champions, the New Zealand Saints! They play at the Sky Arena and have 6 more games this season, with 4 at home in the TSB Bank Arena.\n\nThe 1990s saw stars like Phill Jones and Pero Cameron light up the league. In recent years, we‚Äôve seen former and current Tall Blacks, such as Dillon Boucher, Lindsay Tait, Mika Vukona, Paora Winitana, and Paul Henare, making their mark as both players and coaches. NBL alumni like Kirk Penney, Steven Adams, and Torrey Craig have even made it to the NBA, while many others have thrived in the Australian NBL and European leagues.\n\nCelebrate the love of the game and get active on International Play Day!\n\n#internationalplayday #nbl #nba #wellingtonsaints #basketball \n@nba @saintsbasketball üì∏ taken  at the game from a.fan!\".",
