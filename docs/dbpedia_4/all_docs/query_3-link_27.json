He Whakamārama\n\nBackground\n\nChanges in Membership\n\nAdvice has been received of the following changes in membership for the Forum:\n\n1. Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Whare (TRONW) has appointed Bronco Carson as their appointed member and Jane Nicholas as the alternate member.\n\n2. Hineuru Iwi Trust has appointed Mei Winitana as their appointed member.\n\nAppointment of a Deputy Chairperson\n\nAt the Forum’s meeting on 9 April 2021, the Forum deferred the election of a Deputy Chairperson to allow further time for TRONW to consider more permanent representation, as they wished to fill the Forum Deputy Chairperson position.\n\nProvisions for the election of the Deputy Chairperson are set out under the Forum’s Standing Orders 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4:\n\n• The Forum must decide by resolution to use one of two voting systems (as set out in section 2 below) when electing people to the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson positions.\n\n• The appointment must be decided at a meeting by vote and by the majority of members present and voting.\n\n• The appointment is for a term of 3 years, unless the Deputy Chairperson resigns or is removed by the Forum during that term, and may be reappointed by the Forum.\n\n2. Voting System for election of Deputy Chairperson\n\nThe Forum must resolve to use one of the following voting systems, as set out in the Forum’s Standing Orders:\n\n“System A\n\n(a) requires that a person is elected or appointed if he or she receives the votes of a majority of the members of the Forum voting; and\n\n(b) has the following characteristics:\n\n(i) there is a first round of voting for all candidates; and\n\n(ii) if no candidate is successful in that round there is a second round of voting from which the candidate with the fewest votes in the first round is excluded; and\n\n(iii) If no candidate is successful in the second round there is a third, and if necessary subsequent round of voting from which, each time, the candidate with the fewest votes in the previous round is excluded; and\n\n(iv) In any round of voting if 2 or more candidates tie for the lowest number of votes, the person excluded from the next round is resolved by lot.\n\nSystem B\n\n(a) requires that a person is elected or appointed if he or she receives more votes than any other candidate; and\n\n(b) has the following characteristics:\n\n(i) there is only one round of voting; and\n\n(ii) if 2 or more candidates tie for the most votes, the tie is resolved by lot.”\n\nIt is recommended that the Forum selects System B as its voting system.\n\n3. The Voting Process\n\nThe following provides the steps in the voting process:\n\n1. Forum resolves to adopt a voting system and the procedure in the event of a tie.\n\n2. The Chairperson calls for nominations for Deputy Chairperson (nominated and seconded).\n\n3. Nominees may be allowed up to 10 minutes to make a presentation.\n\n4. Voting for the appointment of the Deputy Chairperson as per the agreed system.\n\n5. Deputy Chairperson declared elected.\n\nIn agreeing the voting process, ground rules are also agreed.\n\nGround Rules\n\na) A member may nominate or second themselves.\n\nb) Any member may call for a Division – where the names of members voting for and against and any abstentions, are taken down in random order.\n\n4. Ngā Whakaarohanga\n\nConsiderations\n\n4.1 Ngā Mōrea me Ngā Whakangāwaritanga\n\nRisks and Mitigations\n\nThere are no significant risks associated with this decision.\n\n4.2 Huringa Āhuarangi\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and there is no need to consider climate change impacts.\n\n4.3 Ngā Pānga ki te Māori\n\nImplications for Māori\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature where there are no significant implications for Māori associated with the decision.\n\n4.4 Whakawhitiwhiti ā-Hapori\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\n4.5 Ngā Pānga ā-Pūtea\n\nFinancial Implications\n\nThere are no material unbudgeted financial implications and this fits within the allocated budget.\n\n5. Ngā Mahi Whai Ake\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe Deputy Chair will assume the role for a term of three years until June 2024, unless they resign or are removed by the Forum during that term.\n\nInformation and Acknowledgement Display Panels at Aniwhenua Reserve Playground (Holly's Playground)\n\nNgā tūtohutanga\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Rangitāiki River Forum:\n\n1 Receives the report, Information and Acknowledgement Display Panels at Aniwhenua Reserve Playground (Holly's Playground).\n\n2 Endorses an application to Bay of Plenty Regional Council’s Environmental Enhancement Fund to support the production and installation of tuna interpretation panels and an acknowledgement board at Holly’s Playground at Aniwhenua Reserve to honour the late Bill Kerrison (Founder of the Kokopu Trust);\n\n3 Seeks collaboration and support of the respective Forum partners to assist with this mahi and its ongoing maintenance (WDC).\n\n1. He Whakamārama\n\nBackground\n\nBay of Plenty Regional Council (BORPC) staff recently received communication from Holly’s Playground Committee Secretary (Cr Alison Silcock) to inform of the playground committee’s interest to seek support for the following installations at Holly’s Playground at Lake Aniwaniwa:\n\n1) Existing tuna information currently displayed inside the playground’s tuna sculpture to be displayed on the walls of the playground shelter;\n\n2) Installation of an acknowledgment panel/board to honour the late Bill Kerrison, Kokopu Trust founder. This suggestion was received from a member of the public and the support of Mr Kerrison’s wife has been sought and received.\n\n2. Proposal\n\nStaff would like to seek the Forum’s interest to:\n\n1. Endorse an application to BOPRC’s Environmental Enhancement Fund (EEF) to contribute towards the panel design and installation costs; and\n\n2. Support, lead, collaborate and input into the installation of the display panels;\n\nIf the Forum wish to lead and support the above work, BOPRC staff will assist by providing advice on completing an application to the Environmental enhancement fund.\n\nThat Whakatāne District Council support the request of the care-group and as landowners accept the ongoing maintenance of these panels.\n\nThe proposed acknowledgement panel for Bill Kerrison will involve the input and approval of the Kerrison whānau.\n\n3. Ngā Whakaarohanga\n\nConsiderations\n\n3.1 Ngā Mōrea me Ngā Whakangāwaritanga\n\nRisks and Mitigations\n\nThere are no significant risks associated with this initiative/proposal.\n\n3.2 Huringa Āhuarangi\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are not sensitive to the effects of climate change. Staff have also considered the effect of the initiative on greenhouse gas emissions and recommend that there will be no effect.\n\n3.3 Ngā Pānga ki te Māori\n\nImplications for Māori\n\nThis proposal is being brought to the Forum to gauge whether there is support for this proposal from RRF members, who represent a number of the iwi and hapū of the Rangitāiki catchment.\n\n3.4 Whakawhitiwhiti ā-Hapori\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\n3.5 Te Hāngai ki te Pou Tarāwaho Rautaki\n\nAlignment with Strategic Framework\n\nThese panels promote the Rangitāiki River, community, vulnerable ecosystems and healthy rivers which all align with key performance indicators of the Regional Council and Te Ara Whānui o Rangitāiki.\n\n3.6 Ngā Pānga ā-Pūtea\n\nFinancial Implications\n\nThe budget will be subject to a successful application to the EEF Fund.\n\n4. Ngā Mahi Whai Ake\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe project is scoped as far as content and once content is agreed, costed. The Environmental Enhancement Fund Application form is completed by Holly’s care-group with the associated costs, a map, permission from the landowner (WDC) and a letter of support from RRF may be provided with the application. Advice from either the EEF coordinator or an eastern land management officer is available."
