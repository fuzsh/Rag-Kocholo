        "text": "NELSON (NZNBL) - Former New Zealand Tall Blacks Phill Jones and Paora Winitana have guided the Nelson Giants and Bay Hawks to elimination final victories as the NZNBL playoffs got underway tonight.\n\nJones piled in 23 points and received strong support from imports Darryl Dora (26 points, 13 rebounds) and Rod Grizzard (22 points, 7 rebounds) as the Giants defeated the Manawatu Jets 89-76 in Nelson. FIBA World Championship strongman Mika Vukona finished with 14 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists.\n\nFringe Tall Black Jeremiah Trueman did his chances of national team selection no harm with 23 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists for the Jets, while former Duke Blue Devil Nick Horvath, a chance to fill the Tall Blacks' naturalised position for the FIBA Oceania Championship in September, registered 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nIn the other elimination final in Taradale, Winitana was on fire with 25 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists as the Bay Hawks defeated the Southland Sharks 89-75. Former Syracuse star Josh Pace collected 19 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists.\n\nTall Black Mark Dickel led the Sharks with 14 points, 6 assists, 4 rebounds and 4 steals, while import Sylvester Spicer had 22 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nThe NZNBL semi finals are a double header this Friday night in Wellington, with Nelson facing the top-of-the table Wellington Saints and the Bay Hawks taking on the second placed Waikato Pistons.\n\nNot even the Pistons 11th straight victory, a 93-61 demolition of the Otago Nuggets in the final round of the regular season, could pry first place from the Saints. Tall Blacks centre Alex Pledger led the way with 18 points, 13 rebounds and 2 blocks, while highwire act Thomas Abercrombie swatted five shots to keep the fans entertained.\n\nIn contrast, the Saints enter the playoffs on a three game losing streak, falling 94-77 to the lowly Auckland Pirates in the final round despite 16 points and 6 rebounds from import Erron Maxey.\n\nImport Kevin Smith led the Pirates' scoring with 17 points, but it was 2009 FIBA U19 World Championship star Brook Ruscoe who stole the show, scoring 14 points on 4/5 shooting in just 18 minutes. Former Tall Black Dillon Boucher was his usual self with 7 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals and a block.\n\nWith Nelson having beaten Wellington in six of their last season encounters, their semi final is anyone's to win, while Waikato enter their match-up with Hawks Bay as clear favourites. The NZNBL grand final will be held on Sunday night (17 July).\n\nPaulo Kennedy"
